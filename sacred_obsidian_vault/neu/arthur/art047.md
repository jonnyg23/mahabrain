Wild, aghast<br>  He stood, all naked in the rain,<br>  'Twas Tristram, he of Lyonesse,<br>  A good knight once, but now--" Again<br>  She laughed, then sneered.--And one might guess<br>  The thing she hinted in disdain.<br>  <br>                    III<br>  <br>  So Isolt watched now:  long she leant<br>  From her high tower that hapless dawn:<br>  Above her bloomed the firmament,<br>  Below, the world was dewy wan.<br>  She saw a long lake where the stags<br>  Came down to drink:  and woods of pines<br>  Beyond which mountains loomed, whose crags,--<br>  Gaunt guardians of Mark's boundary lines,--<br>  Gray watch-towers, hawk-like, overhung;<br>  And 'mid the pines, wild, ivy-clung,<br>  She saw a castle lift its old<br>  Green walls of ruin, now a cave<br>  For bandits, and a robber-hold<br>  Of lust, beside a torrent's wave.<br>  Then o'er a bridge, whose granite arched<br>  The torrent's foam, she saw a knight,--<br>  Behind whom spear-armed followers marched,--<br>  Like Galahad, in glittering white,<br>  Ride from the forest-covered height.<br>  <br>                    IV<br>  <br>  High on a barb whose trappings shone<br>  Inlaid with laton, gold of hue,<br>  Star-bright amid the dawn and dew;<br>  Proud on his lordly-stepping roan<br>  He rode, and seemed of chivalry<br>  The star, until he stood alone<br>  Before the Court and spoke his lie,<br>  And said,--(for him, too, heart and tongue,<br>  Mark's gold had bought)--"I saw him die.<br>  Alas! for one so brave and young!<br>  But better so than still to be<br>  A madman and a mockery!"--<br>  Then smiled around the questioning Court<br>  As one who brought no ill report. . . .<br>  And she believed.  And front to front<br>  With all her misery that eve,--<br>  Which, sombre-visaged, o'er the mount,<br>  Above Day's burning bier did grieve<br>  And bow her melancholy star,--<br>  With tearful eyes she watched the light<br>  Streak all the heaven with blood afar;<br>  And lingered far into the night,<br>  Lamenting at her casement-bar.<br>  <br>                    V<br>  <br>  "Oh, I'm like one who o'er her light,<br>  Her lamp of love, bends down, when, lo!<br>  All on a sudden, out of night,<br>  Dashing it down, there comes a blow<br>  That leaves all darkness;  and she hears<br>  A demon whispering in the gloom,<br>  That shuts her in with all her fears,"<br>  So thought she, lonely in her room.<br>  Then took her lute and touched such airs<br>  As Tristram loved, sad songs of Breön,<br>  She once had heard, all unawares,<br>  Sir Launcelot sing in old Caerleön,<br>  To Guinevere upon the stairs,<br>  The terrace stairs, beside the Usk,<br>  Deep in the nightingale-haunted dusk.<br>  Then ceased, and wept until the stars,<br>  Seen through her tears, made heaven all tears,<br>  On fire with tears, that left their scars<br>  Upon its face;  and all the years<br>  Of grief and love seemed in their spheres:<br>  And reaching out her arms she cried,<br>  "O God!  O God!  that I had died!<br>  O Tristram!  Tristram!  art thou near?<br>  O love, be near me in this hour!<br>  This hour of anguish and of fear!<br>  Which,--(like yon fountain's ceaseless foam,<br>  Unseen, beneath this starlit tower,<br>  Deep in the shadow of its dome),--<br>  Throbs on and on within my life,<br>  The utter darkness of its woe.--<br>  O hour of grief!  O hour of strife!<br>  Why must my young heart suffer so?<br>  Why must my sick soul sigh and sigh,<br>  And God not hear nor let me die?"<br>  <br>                    VI<br>  <br>  When rose the moon, and far away<br>  A nightingale beneath the tower,<br>  Heard through the fountain's falling spray,<br>  Made lonelier yet that lonely hour;<br>  And 'twixt the nodding grove and lake<br>  A glimmering fawn stalked through the night,<br>  And snuffed the wind, then bent to slake<br>  Its thirst;  she veiled her face,--as white<br>  As death's,--and said:  "The way is clear!<br>  There is no use in waiting here!<br>  Come! let me cure this heart that bursts!<br>  This pain is more than I can bear!--<br>  Come! let me still this soul that thirsts! . . .<br>  Upon the lake, as thick as stars<br>  In heav'n, the lilies lie asleep.--<br>  There lies a way beyond these bars,<br>  These walls of flesh that hold and keep!<br>  The nightingale shall find its mate,<br>  The fawn its fellow, and must I,<br>  The spouse of grief, the wife of hate,<br>  Live on alone until I die?--<br>  How long, how long, O God, to wait!" . . .<br>  Far through the darkness went her cry.<br>
