CONSTANT LOUNSBERY</h2>  </center>  <br>  <br> 	Part I<br> Throughout the ambiguous April day<br> The skylark wings his singing way,<br> And trills a rhapsody of May.<br> <br> The wind that sweetens earth with spring<br> Falls on the ocean, wakening<br> The rising waves beneath his wing.<br> <br> While swiftly from her native lea<br> A Cornish bark, rejoicingly,<br> Bears Iseult o'er the Irish sea.<br> <br> With eyes reverted toward the land<br> Dimly she sees the paling strand<br> Diminish to a silvery band.<br> <br> But, as a carrier pigeon springs<br> Homeward on strong, exulting wings,<br> The alien ship glides on, and flings<br> <br> The waters green to gleaming spray,<br> Threading its pathless southward way,<br> While shine and shower cross the day.<br> <br> And where the ripples bud and break<br> The sea mews drift along its wake,<br> Like boats the tide at will may take.<br> <br> Then landward o'er the glistering main<br> Fair Iseult flings her song.  In vain!<br> The wind beats back the sad refrain,--<br> <br> 	SONG<br> Farewell, farewell, a long farewell to thee,<br> O happy isle, blue girdled of the sea!<br> Fair are thy fields of green that fade to grey,<br> And dim mine eyes, with watching wistfully<br> The lengthening of the endless watery way.<br> Farewell, farewell, a long farewell to thee.<br> <br> Farewell, farewell, a long farewell to thee!<br> Thine is my love, and thine the heart of me,<br> Through all the widening of the alien years<br> My hopes be thine, and thine the memory<br> That brightens through the bitterness of tears.<br> Farewell, farewell, a long farewell to thee!<br> <br> Farewell, farewell, a long farewell to thee!<br> Thou art the world, what other world could be?<br> Lo! I had hoped, when life was o'er, to die<br> Upon thy breast, and smiling peacefully<br> To whisper, ere words falter to a sigh,<br> Farewell, farewell, a long farewell to thee!<br> <br> 	Part II<br> As clouds obscure the April skies,<br> The overwhelming tears arise,<br> And tremble in her baffled eyes.<br> <br> The gleeful breezes pluck and woo<br> Her kirtle, where the crocus' hue<br> Flames up a robe of violet blue.<br> <br> Hers is a face whose beauty seen<br> Makes one forget what life has been,<br> And own her, henceforth, utter queen.<br> <br> Thus Tristram, dreaming, lingers there<br> Unknown, perplexed of her despair,<br> And timid, seeing grief so fair.<br> <br> "I would not anger thee, by Heaven,<br> Yet let my presence be forgiven<br> For all the joy that thine has given!<br> <br> "Sorrow, methinks, has wearied thee,<br> And weariness comes over me<br> From battling with the wind and sea.<br> <br> "Behold a goblet rich with gold,<br> And mellow wine, matured of old,<br> A luscious draught of heat and cold!<br> <br> "Nay, cheer thy heart, and pledge me then,<br> As in those hours of anguish, when<br> Wounded I lay among thy men."<br> <br> So pleads he, till she smiles again,<br> And, drinking, feels through every vein<br> A joy that trembles into pain.<br> <br> He raises high the bowl with half<br> The dancing poison, sweet to quaff,<br> And drains its sweetness with a laugh.<br> <br> And, in a trenchant stroke of light,<br> Love cleaves the darkness of their night,<br> And puts the fading world to flight.<br> <br> As one who knows not Life from Death,<br> Nor yet what power Love's language hath,<br> He calls with half-abated breath,--<br> <br> <i> Iseult!</i>   One wild, unmated word,<br> <i> Iseult!</i>   No sound so sweet is heard<br> In all the lyric speech of bird.<br> <br> But, softer than a startled sigh,<br> Her voice reluctant, breathes reply,<br> <i> Tristram!</i> --a tender, summoning cry.<br> <br> And all is silent save alone<br> The sea's reverberate monotone,<br> With Love's own voice in unison.<br>
