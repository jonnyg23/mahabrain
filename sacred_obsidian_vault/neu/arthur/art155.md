'mid all yon courtly crew<br>           Of lordly rank and lofty line,<br>  Is there to love and honour true,<br>           That boasts a pulse so warm as mine?<br>  They praised thy diamonds' lustre rare --<br>           Match'd with thine eyes, I thought it faded;<br>  They praised the pearls that bound thy hair--<br>           I saw only the locks they braided;<br>  They talk'd of wealthy dower and land,<br>           And titles of high birth the token --<br>  I thought of Lucy's heart and hand,<br>           Nor knew the sense of what was spoken.<br>  And yet, if rank'd in Fortune's roll,<br>           I might have learn'd their choice unwise,<br>  Who rate the dower above the soul,<br>           And Lucy's diamonds o'er her eyes.<br>  <br>                                VII.<br>  My lyre -- it is an idle toy,<br>           That borrows accents not its own,<br>  Like warbler of Colombian sky,<br>           That sings in a mimic tone.<br>  Ne'er did it sound o'er sainted well,<br>  Nor boasts it aught of Border spell;<br>  It strings no feudal slogan pour,<br>  Its heroes draw no broad claymore;<br>  No shouting clans applauses raise,<br>  Because it sung their father's praise;<br>  On Scottish moor, or English down,<br>  It ne'er was graced with fair renown;<br>  Norwon -- best meed to minstrel true --<br>  One favouring smile from fair BUCCLEUCH!<br>  By one poor streamlet sounds its tone,<br>  And heard by one dear maid alone.<br>  <br>                                VIII.<br>  But, if thou bid'st, these tones shall tell<br>  Of errant knight, and damozelle;<br>  Of a dread knot a Wizard tied,<br>  In punishment of maiden's pride,<br>  In notes of marvel and of fear,<br>  That best may charm romantic ear.<br>  For Lucy loves (like COLLINS, ill-starred name,<br>  Whose lay's requital was that tardy fame,<br>  Who bound no laurel round his living head,<br>  Should hang it o'er his monument when dead)<br>  For Lucy loves to tread enchanted strand,<br>  And thread, like him, the maze of fairy land;<br>  Of golden battlements to view the gleam,<br>  And slumber soft by some Elysian stream;<br>  Such lays she loves; and, such my Lucy's choice,<br>  What other song can claim her Poet's voice?<br>  <br>  <b> Canto First.</b> <br>                                I.<br>  Where is the maiden of mortal strain<br>  That may match with the Baron of Triermain?<br>  She must be lovely, and constant, and kind,<br>  Holy and pure, and humble of mind,<br>  Blithe of cheer, and gentle of mood,<br>  Courteous, and generous, and noble of blood,<br>  Lovely as the sun's first ray<br>  When it breaks the clouds of an April day;<br>  Constant and true as the widow'd dove,<br>  Kind as a minstrel that sings of love;<br>  Pure as the fountain in rocky cave,<br>  Where never sunbeam kiss'd the wave;<br>  Humble as a maiden that loves in vain,<br>  Holy as a hermit's vesper strain;<br>  Gentle as a breeze that but whispers and dies,<br>  Yet blithe as the light leaves that dance in its sighs;<br>  Courteous as monarch the morn he is crown'd,<br>  Generous as spring-dews that bless the glad ground;<br>  Noble her blood as the currents that met<br>  In the veins of the noblest Plantangenet:<br>  Such must her form be, her mood and her strain,<br>  That shall match with Sir Roland of Triermain.<br>  <br>                                II.<br>  Sir Roland de Vaux he hath laid him to sleep,<br>  His blood it was fever'd, his breathing was deep.<br>  He had been pricking against the Scot,<br>  The foray was long, and the skirmish hot;<br>  His dinted helm and his buckler's plight<br>  Bore token of a stubborn fight.<br>           All in the castle must hold them still,<br>  Harpers must lull him to his rest<br>  With the slow soft tunes he loves the best,<br>  Till sleep sink down upon his breast<br>           Like the dew on a summer hill.<br>  <br>                                III.<br>  It was the dawn of an autumn day;<br>  The sun was struggling with a frost-fog grey,<br>  That like a silvery crape was spread<br>  Round Skiddaw's dim and distant head,<br>  And faintly gleam'd each painted pane<br>  Of the lordly halls of Triermain,<br>                 When that Baron bold awoke.<br>  Starting he woke, and loudly did call,<br>  Rousing his menials in bower and hall,<br>                 While hastily he spoke.<br>  <br>                                IV.<br>  'Hearken, my minstrels! which of ye all<br>  Touch'd his harp with that dying fall,<br>                 So sweet, so soft, so faint,<br>  It seem'd an angel's whisper'd call<br>                 To an expiring saint?<br>  And harken, my merry men! what time or where<br>                 Did she pass, that maid with her heavenly brow,<br>  With her look so sweet and her eyes so fair,<br>  And her graceful step and her angel air,<br>  And the eagle plume in her dark-brown hair,<br>                 That pass'd from my bower e'en now?'<br>  <br>                                V.<br>  Answer'd him Richard de Bretville -- he<br>  Was chief of the Baron's minstrelsy:<br>  'Silent, noble chieftain, we<br>                 Have sat since midnight close,<br>  When such lulling sounds as the brooklet sings<br>  Murmur'd from our melting strings<br>           And hush'd you to repose.<br>           Had a harp-note sounded here<br>           It had caught my watchful ear,<br>  Although it fell as faint and shy<br>  As bashful maiden's half-form'd sigh,<br>           When she thinks her lover near.'<br>  Answer'd Philip of Fasthwaite tall --<br>  He kept guard in the outer hall:<br>  'Since at eve our watch took post,<br>  Not a foot has thy portal cross'd;<br>           Else had I heard the steps, though low<br>  And light they fell, as when the earth receives, <br>  In morn of frost, the wither'd leaves<br>           That drop when no winds blow.'<br>  <br>                                VI.<br>  'Then come thou hither, Henry, my page,<br>  Whom I saved from the sack of Hermitage,<br>  When that dark castle, tower, and spire,<br>  Rose to the skies a pile of fire.<br>           And redden'd all the Nine-stane Hill,<br>  And the shrieks of death, that wildly broke<br>  Through devouring flame and smothering smoke,<br>           Made the warrior's heart-blood chill.<br>  The trustiest thou of all my train,<br>  My fleetest courser thou must rein,<br>                 And ride to Lyulph's tower,<br>  And from the Baron of Treirmain<br>                 Greet well that sage of power.<br>  He is sprung from Druid sires,<br>  And British bards that tuned their lyres<br>  To Arthur's and Pendragon's praise,<br>  And his who sleeps at Dunmailraise.<br>  Gifted like his gifted race,<br>  He the characters can trace,<br>  Graven deep in elder time,<br>  Upon Helvellyn's cliffs sublime;<br>  Sign and sigil well doth he know,<br>  And can bode of weal and woe,<br>  Of kingdoms' fall, and fate of wars,<br>  From mystic dreams and course of stars.<br>  He shall tell if middle earth,<br>  To that enchanting shape gave birth,<br>  Of if t'was but an airy thing,<br>  Such as fantastic slumbers bring,<br>  Fram'd from the rainbow's varying dyes<br>  Or fading tints of western skies.<br>  For, by the Blessed Rood I swear,<br>  If that fair form breathe vital air,<br>  No other maiden by my side<br>  Shall ever rest De Vaux's bride!'<br>  <br>                                VII.<br>  The faithful Page he mounts his steed,<br>  And soon he cross'd green Irthing's mead,<br>  Dash'd o'er Kirkoswald's verdant plain,<br>  And Eden barr'd his course in vain.<br>  He pass'd red Penrith's Table Round,<br>  For feats of chivalry renown'd.<br>  Left Mayburgh's mound and stones of power,<br>  By Druid's raised in magic hour,<br>  And traced the Eamont's winding way,<br>  Till Ulfo's lake beneath him lay.<br>  <br>                                VIII.<br>  Onward he rode, the pathway still<br>  Winding betwixt the lake and hill;<br>  Till, on the fragment of a rock,<br>  Struck from its base by lightning shock,<br>                 He saw the hoary Sage;<br>  The silver moss and lichen twined,<br>  With fern and deer-hair check'd and lined,<br>                 A cushion fit for age;<br>  And o'er him shook the aspen-tree,<br>  A restless, rustling canopy.<br>  Then sprung young Henry from his selle,<br>                 And greeted Lyulph grave;<br>  And then his master's tale did tell,<br>                 And then for counsel crave.<br>  The Man of Years mused long and deep,<br>  Of time's lost treasures taking keep,<br>  And then, as rousing from a sleep,<br>                 His solemn answer gave.<br>  <br>                                IX.<br>  'That maid is born of middle earth,<br>                 And may of man be won,<br>  Though there have glided since her birth<br>                 Five hundred years and one,<br>  But where's the knight in all the north<br>  That dare the adventure follow forth,<br>  So perilous to knightly worth,<br>                 In the valley of Saint John?<br>  Listen, youth, to what I tell,<br>  And bind it on thy memory well;<br>  Nor muse that I commence the rhyme<br>  Far distant 'mid the wrecks of time.<br>  The mystic tale, by bard and sage,<br>  Is handed down from Merlin's age.<br>  <br>                                X.<br>  <b> LYULPH'S TALE</b> <br>  'King Arthur has ridden from merry Carlisle<br>                 When Pentecost was o'er:<br>  He journey'd like errant-knight the while,<br>  And sweetly the summer sun did smile<br>                 On mountain, moss, and moor.<br>  Above his solitary track<br>  Rose Glaramara's ridgy back, <br>  Amid whose yawning gulfs the sun<br>  Cast umber'd radiance red and dun,<br>  Though never sunbeam could discern<br>  The surface of that sable tarn,<br>  In whose black mirror you may spy<br>  The stars, while noontide lights the sky.<br>  The gallant King he skirted still<br>  The margin of that mighty hill;<br>  Rock upon rocks incumbent hung,<br>  And torrents down the gullies flung,<br>  Join'd the rude river that brawl'd on,<br>  Recoiling now from crag and stone,<br>  Now diving deep from human ken,<br>  And raving down its darksome glen.<br>  The Monarch judged this desert wild,<br>  With such romantic ruin piled,<br>  Was theatre by Nature's hand<br>  For feat of high achievement plann'd.<br>  <br>                                XI.<br>  'O rather he chose, that Monarch bold,<br>                 On vent'rous quest to ride,<br>  In plate and mail, by wood and wold,<br>  Than, with ermine trapp'd and cloth of gold,<br>                 In princely bower to bide:<br>  The bursting crash of a foeman's spear<br>           As it shiver'd against his mail,<br>  Was merrier music to his ear<br>           Than courtier's whisper'd tale:<br>  And the clash of Caliburn more dear,<br>           When on the hostile casque it rung,<br>                 Than all the lays<br>                 To their monarch's praise<br>           That the harpers of Reged sung.<br>  He loved better to rest by wood or river,<br>  Than in bower of his bride, Dame Guenever,<br>  For he left that lady, so lovely of cheer,<br>  To follow adventures of danger and fear;<br>  And the frank-hearted Monarch full little did wot<br>  That she smiled in his absence, on brave Lancelot.<br>  <br>                                XII.<br>  'He rode, till over down and dell<br>  The shade more broad and deeper fell;<br>  And though around the mountain's head<br>  Flow'd streams of purple, and gold, and red,<br>  Dark at the base, unblest by beam<br>  Frown'd the black rocks, and roar'd the stream.<br>  With toil the King his way pursued<br>  By lonely Threlkeld's waste and wood,<br>  Till on his course obliquely shone<br>  The narrow valley of SAINT JOHN,<br>  Down sloping to the western sky,<br>  Where lingering sunbeams love to lie.<br>  Right glad to feel those beams again,<br>  The King drew up his charger's rein;<br>  With gauntlet raised he screen'd his sight,<br>  As dazzled with the level light,<br>  And, from beneath his glove of mail, <br>  Scann'd at his ease his the lovely vale,<br>  While 'gainst the sun his armour bright<br>  Gleam'd ruddy like the beacon's light.<br>  <br>                                XIII.<br>  'Paled in by many a lofty hill,<br>  The narrow dale lay smooth and still,<br>  And, down its verdant bosom led,<br>  A winding brooklet found its bed.<br>  But, midmost of the vale, a mound<br>  Arose with airy turrets crown'd,<br>  Buttress, and rampire's circling bound<br>                 And mighty keep and tower;<br>  Seem'd some primeval giant's hand<br>  The castle's massive walls had plann'd,<br>  A ponderous bulwark to withstand<br>                 Ambitious Nimrod's power.<br>  Above the moated entrance slung,<br>  The balanced drawbridge trembling hung,<br>                 As jealous of a foe;<br>  Wicket of oak, as iron hard,<br>  With iron studded, clench'd, and barr'd,<br>  And prong'd portcullis, join'd to guard<br>                 The gloomy pass below.<br>  But the grey walls, no banners crown'd,<br>  Upon the watch-tower's airy round<br>  No warder stood his horn to sound,<br>  No guard beside the drawbridge was found,<br>  And, where the Gothic gateway frown'd<br>                 Glanced neither bill nor bow.<br>  <br>                                XIV.<br>  'Beneath the castle's gloomy pride<br>  In ample round did Arthur ride<br>  Three times; nor living thing he spied,<br>                 Nor heard a living sound,<br>  Save that, awakening from her dream,<br>  The owlet now began to scream,<br>  In concert with the rushing stream,<br>                 That wash'd the battled mound.<br>  He lighted from his goodly steed,<br>  And left him to graze on bank and mead;<br>  And slowly he climb'd the narrow way<br>  That reach'd the entrance grim and grey,<br>  And he stood the outward arch below,<br>  And his bugle-horn prepared to blow,<br>                 In summons blithe and bold,<br>  Deeming to rouse from iron sleep<br>  The guardian of this dismal Keep,<br>                 Which well he guess'd the hold<br>  Of wizard stern, or goblin grim,<br>  Or pagan of gigantic limb,<br>                 The tyrant of the wold.<br>  <br>                                XV.<br>  'The ivory bugle's golden tip<br>  Twice touch'd the Monarch's manly lip,<br>                 And twice his hand withdrew.<br>  Think not but Arthur's heart was good!<br>  His shield was cross'd by the blessed rood,<br>  Had a pagan host before him stood<br>                 He had charged them through and through;<br>  Yet the silence of that ancient place<br>  Sunk on his heart, and he paused a space<br>                 Ere yet his horn he blew.<br>  But, instant as its 'larum rung,<br>  The castle gate was open flung,<br>  Portcullis rose with crashing groan<br>  Full harshly up its groove of stone;<br>  And down the trembling drawbridge cast;<br>  The vaulted arch before him lay,<br>  With nought to bar the gloomy way,<br>  And onward Arthur paced, with hand<br>  On Caliburn's resistless brand.<br>  <br>                                XVI.<br>  'An hundred torches, flashing bright,<br>  Dispell'd at once the gloomy night<br>                 That lour'd along the walls,<br>  And show'd the King's astonish'd sight<br>                 The inmates of the halls.<br>  Nor wizard stern, nor goblin grim,<br>  Nor giant huge of form and limb,<br>                 Nor heathen knight, was there;<br>  But the cressets, which odours flung aloft,<br>  Show'd by their yellow light and soft,<br>                 A band of damsels fair.<br>  Onward they came, like summer wave<br>                 That dances to the shore;<br>  An hundred voices welcome gave,<br>                 And welcome o'er and o'er!<br>  An hundred lovely hands assail<br>  The bucklers of the Monarch's mail,<br>  And busy labour'd to unhasp<br>  Rivet of steel and iron clasp,<br>  One wrapp'd him in a mantle fair,<br>  And one flung odours on his hair;<br>  His short curl'd ringlets one smooth'd down,<br>  One wreath'd them in a myrtle crown.<br>  A bride upon her wedding-day<br>  Was tended ne'er by troop so gay.<br>  <br>                                XVII.<br>  'Loud laugh'd they all,--

the rose.<br>  Behind him were in triumph borne<br>  The warlike arms he late had worn.<br>  Four of the train combined to rear<br>  The terrors of Tintadgel's spear;<br>  Two, laughing at their lack of strength,<br>  Dragg'd Caliburn in cumbrous length;<br>  One, while she aped a martial stride,<br>  Placed on her brows  the helmit's pride;<br>  Then scream'd, 'twixt laughter and surprise,<br>  To feel its depth o'erwhelm her eyes.<br>  With revel-shout, and triumph-song,<br>  Thus gaily march'd the giddy throng.<br>  <br>                                XVIII.<br>  'Through many a gallery

warlike guest,<br>  With greeting in that fair degree,<br>  Where female pride and courtesy<br>  Are blended with such passing art<br>  As awes at once and charms the heart.<br>  A courtly welcome first she gave,<br>  Then of his goodness 'gan to crave<br>                 Construction fair and true<br>  Of her light maidens' idle mirth<br>  Who drew from lovely glens their birth,<br>  Nor knew to pay to stranger worth<br>                 And dignity their due;<br>  Then she pray'd that he would rest<br>  That night her castle's honour'd guest.<br>  The Monarch meetly thanks express'd;<br>

               Their shadows on the stream.<br>  'Tis no deceit! distinctly clear<br>  Crenell and parapet appear,<br>  While o'er the pile that meteor drear<br>                 Makes momentary

borne,<br>  The moon renew'd her silver horn,<br>  Just at the time her waning ray,<br>  Had faded in the dawning day,<br>                 A summer mist arose;<br>  Adown the vale the vapours float,<br>  And cloudy undulations moat<br>  That tufted mound of mystic note,<br>                 As round its base they close.<br>  And higher now the fleecy tide<br>  Ascends its stern and shaggy side,<br>  Until the airy billows hide<br>                 The rock's majestic isle;<br>  It seem'd a veil of filmy lawn,<br>  By some fantastic fairy drawn<br>                 Around enchanted

shook that filmy screen,<br>  Were towers and bastions dimly seen,<br>  And Gothic battlements between<br>           Their gloomy length unroll'd.<br>  Speed, speed, De Vaux, ere on thine eye<br>  Once more the fleeting vision die!<br>           The gallant knight 'gan speed<br>  As prompt and light as, when the hound<br>  Is opening, and the horn is wound,<br>           Careers the hunter's steed.<br>  Down the steep dell his course amain<br>           Hath rivall'd archer's shaft;<br>  But ere the mound he could attain,<br>  The rocks their shapeless form regain,<br>  And, mocking loud his labour vain,<br>           The mountain spirits laugh'd.<br>  Far up the echoing dell was borne<br>  Their wild unearthly shout of scorn.<br>  <br>                                XIII.<br>  Wroth
