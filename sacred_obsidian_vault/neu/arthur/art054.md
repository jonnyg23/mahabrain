Show me Thy blood!<br>  Thy body and Thy blood! Give me the Quest!<br>  Lord, I am faint and tired; my soul is sick<br>  Of all the falseness, all the little aims,<br>  The weary vanities, the gasping joys,<br>  The slow procession of this satiate world!<br>  Dear Lord, I burn for Thee! Give me Thy Quest!<br>  Down through the old reverberating time,<br>  I see Thy knights in wonderful array<br>  Go out to victory, like the solemn stars<br>  Fighting in courses, with their conquering swords,<br>  Their sad, fixed lips of purity and strength,<br>  Their living glory, their majestic death.<br>  Give me Thy Quest! Show me the Sangreal, Lord!"<br>  <br>  He lay upon a mountain's rocky crest,<br>  So high, that all the glittering, misty world,<br>  All summer's splendid tempests, lay below,<br>  And sudden lightnings quivered at his feet;<br>  So still, not any sound of silentness<br>  Expressed the silence, nor the pallid sun<br>  Burned on his eyelids; all alone and still,<br>  Save for the prayer that struggled from his lips,<br>  Broken with eager stress. Then he arose.<br>  But always, down the hoary mountain-side,<br>  Through whispering forests, by soft-rippled streams,<br>  In clattering streets, or the great city's roar,<br>  Still from his never sated soul went up,<br>  "Give me Thy Quest! Show me the Sangreal, Lord!"<br>  <br>  Through all the land there poured a trumpet's clang,<br>  And when its silvery anger smote the air,<br>  Men sprang to arms from every true man's home,<br>  And followed to the field. He followed, too, --<br>  All the mad blood of manhood in his veins,<br>  All the fierce instincts of a warring race<br>  Kindled like flame in every tingling limb,<br>  And raging in his soul on fire with war.<br>  He heard a thousand voices call him on:<br>  Lips hot with anguish, shrieking their despair<br>  From swamps and forests and the still bayous<br>  That hide the wanderer, nor bewray his lair;<br>  From fields and marshes where the tropic sun<br>  Scorches a million laborers scourged to work;<br>  From homes that are not homes; from mother-hearts<br>  Torn from the infants lingering at their breasts;<br>  From parted lovers, and from shuddering wives;<br>  From men grown mad with whips and tyranny;<br>  From all a country groaning in its chains.<br>  Nor sleep, nor dream beguiled him any more;<br>  He leaped to manhood in one torrid hour,<br>  And armed, and sped to battle. Now no more<br>  He cried or prayed, -- "Show me the Sangreal, Lord!"<br>  <br>  So in the front of deadly strife he stood; <br>  The glorious thunder of the roaring guns,<br>  The restless hurricane of screaming shells,<br>  The quick, sharp singing of the rifle-balls,<br>  The sudden clash of sabres, and the beat<br>  Of rapid horse-hoofs galloping at charge,<br>  Made a great chorus to his valorous soul,<br>  The dreadful music of a grappling world,<br>  That hurried him to fight. He turned the tide,<br>  But fell upon its turning. Over him<br>  Fluttered the starry flag, and fluttered on,<br>  While he lay helpless on the trampled sward,<br>  His hot life running scarlet from its source,<br>  And all his soul in sudden quiet spent,<br>  As still as on the silent mountain-top;<br>  So still that from his quick-remembering heart<br>  Burst that old cry, -- "Show me the Sangreal, Lord!"<br>  <br>  Then a bright mist descended over him,<br>  And in its central glory stood a shape,<br>  Wounded, yet smiling. With His bleeding hands <br>  Stretched toward that bleeding side, His eyes divine<br>  Like a new dawn, thus softly spake the Lord: --<br>  "The blood poured out for brothers is my blood;<br>  The flesh for brothers broken is my flesh;<br>  No more in golden chalices I dwell,<br>  No longer in a vision, angel-borne:<br>  Here is the Sangreal, here the Holy Quest.<br>  Thy prayer is heard, thy soul is satisfied: <br>  Come, my belovèd! I am come for thee.<br>  <br>  As first I broke the bread and poured the wine,<br>  So have I broken thee and poured thy life,<br>  So do I bless thee and give thanks for thee<br>  So do I bear thee in my wounded hands."<br>  Smiling, He stooped, and kissed the tortured brow,<br>  And over all its anguish stole a smile;<br>  The blood-sealed lips unclosed; the dying breath<br>  Sighed, like the rain-sound in a summer wind,<br>  Sobbing, but sweet, -- "I see the Sangreal, Lord!"<br>
