I cannot choose but cry.<br>        Sweet, fair, and dear! Oh, love me, or I die!"<br>  <br>  So ran the words, and when the lute had twang'd<br>  Itself to silence, and the song had end,<br>  The maid had turn'd to pass adown the wood<br>  Without a word in parting.  Gawain then--<br>  "Fair, sweet, and dear, so seems thy song to me:<br>  What may they call thee, singer?"<br>  <br>                                                           "Marjorie,"<br>  The maid gave answer.  Then the prince: "Thou art<br>  No maid of Orkney, with such eyes and hair."<br>  To which the other:<br>                                       "No, but since my life<br>  Was pluckt from welter of down-streaming seas<br>  In some wild storm, so they that sav'd me say,<br>  None other home than Orkney have I known."<br>  Then by degrees in question and reply,<br>  Did Gawain learn the maiden's history,<br>  Simple enough and like the maid herself:<br>  For after that chance rescue from the sea,<br>  The rough shore folk, kind after their rough kind,<br>  Had made her welcome unto all they had,<br>  And she, content, had dwelt with them till now.<br>  And once a damsel from King Arthur's court<br>  Had taught her songs; she knew not what they meant,<br>  But lov'd to sing them to the damsel's lute.<br>  She ceased and turn'd on Gawain a full face,<br>  And crying, "An it please you, sir, farewell,"<br>  Was gone as lightly as the thistle-down<br>  Is blown along upon a summer breeze.<br>  Then Gawain, rising, strode back slow to court,<br>  Musing the while upon the maid whose hair<br>  Outmatch'd the daw's for blackness, and whose eyes<br>  Gleam'd like the water in a sunless pool,<br>  And on the morrow sought the forest fount,<br>  And on the the morrow after, and again<br>  Until a week was past, yet never saw<br>  Her whom he would, and day by day grew sick<br>  At heart, till all the court had talk of it.<br>  The queen alone, out of her mother wit<br>  At last made happy hazard of the cause,<br>  And drew from him the story of his love;<br>  And, for she hoped this love might keep the prince<br>  At Orkney ever, set herself to find<br>  The maid, and finding, brought her to the court<br>  To serve as maid of honour till the time<br>  Were ripe for her and Gawain to be wed.<br>  Then, thinking, "All is well for them and me,"<br>  Bided content.<br>  <br>           Months sped till twelve wore past,<br>  And still Maid Marjorie bode at the court;<br>  And Gawain likewise bode, till through his blood<br>  Ran sudden promptings like to drive him hence<br>  Ere long, forgetful of Maid Marjorie<br>  Or Bellicent.  Now, as it hapt, there came<br>  Rumours of Arthur to the Orkney court,<br>  And how he beat the heathen down, and how<br>  He fain would build a kingdom in the south<br>  And rear a throne and reign for love of Christ,<br>  And how all brave knights crav'd to serve with him.<br>  This Gawain heard, and, fir'd with knightly zeal,<br>  Past in an hour from boy to man, and took<br>  His armour from the hall, and girt his sword<br>  Upon his thigh, mounted his horse and rode<br>  Away to Arthur in the far southwest,<br>  With scarce a word of parting.<br>  <br>                                         Then the maid,<br>  Who until Gawain went knew not her heart,<br>  Felt that her heart was reft from her, and droopt<br>  Like some dark lily in an August noon;<br>  And all the court were ware and pitied her,<br>  Save one, who fain had drawn Prince Gawain's love<br>  To her, and failing, hated all men sore,<br>  But most the maid in favour at the court.<br>  <br>  Slow wan'd the months, and scant the tidings brought<br>  Of Gawain till a year had past, and then<br>  A rumour blown about the court proclaim'd<br>  The prince was yet with Arthur, and was made<br>  One of the Table Round, and now was fam'd<br>  As much for conquest in the court of Love<br>  As service in the field or tournament.<br>  Many a noble maid, so blew about<br>  The word, had caught the young knight's fancy, caught,<br>  But failed to hold, save for a week or month,<br>  And he had gone his way and left the maid<br>  To grieve, and all men call'd him "light of love,"<br>  "False Gawain," too, but naught did Gawain care.<br>  Now when the accusing whisper reach'd the queen,<br>  She laid command no tongue should tell the tale<br>  To Marjorie; but one, the vengeful maid<br>  Past o'er by Gawain, brought the flying word<br>  To Marjorie, and, fierce with spite, told all.<br>  <br>  This when the damsel Gawain first had lov'd<br>  Heard but still clung to hope, she straightway came<br>  To Bellicent beseeching that the queen<br>  Would grant her escort of some faithful squire,<br>  That she might go herself to Arthur's court<br>  Of Camelot; and pitying Bellicent,<br>  Making no question, knowing well the cause,<br>  Granted the boon, but swell'd it till the maid<br>  Was 'compani'd befitting one of rank.<br>  <br>  Then followed weary days, for first there came<br>  The passage over seas, and journey rough<br>  By ways of peril next, until they drew<br>  Nigh unto Arthur's city of the West,<br>  The hundred-tower'd Camelot.<br>  <br>                                                    It hapt<br>  That day the king rode forth alone, and met<br>  The damsel and her train; she knew him not,<br>  But staying him besought his kingly grace<br>  To tell her if Prince Gawain yet abode<br>  Within that city.  These were all her words,<br>  Yet her whole hist'ry trembl'd in her voice,<br>  Flusht in the rose upon her cheek.<br>  <br>                                                    Then he,<br>  The blameless king, thought in himself, "This maid<br>  Is one our Gawain light has lightly lov'd;"<br>  And then to her:--"The knight of whom you ask<br>  Is absent far upon a quest of mine;<br>  Not for a month will he return--but bide<br>  You here at court that space.  I am the king."<br>  <br>  So Marjorie abode with Guinevere,<br>  To whom the king that night unbarr'd his thought<br>  And added, "When the prince returns, those twain<br>  Shall be made one by Dubric, shall they not?"<br>  And she: "Your will is ever mine, my lord,"<br>  And set herself to bring the thing to pass.<br>  <br>  Now when the month had end and he came not,<br>  And yet another month and still he lagg'd,<br>  Maid Marjorie, boding ill, crav'd to be free,<br>  To go and seek him; and the kindly king,<br>  Doubtful, but fearing to deny the maid,<br>  Let her go forth in charge of good Sir Bors.<br>  Three days they rode, till on an eventide<br>  They came to a lone castle on a crag,<br>  Empty in seeming while the gate swung wide,<br>  And, for they needed shelter, enter'd.  Scarce<br>  The band had clear'd the archway, ere the gate<br>  Clang'd to behind them, and an evil host<br>  Who made that dismal place their robbers' nest<br>  Fell on the slender train with swarming force,<br>  Disarm'd and bound them, though Sir Bors fought hard.<br>  <br>  Then Marjorie, who in woman-fear had cower'd<br>  Till now within her litter, drew aside<br>  The hangings.  Mov'd by her strange beauty, yet<br>  Still more by her sweet voice beseeching them,<br>  The host, scarce knowing why, made pause.  Then she,<br>  Fing'ring her lute, sang as she once had sung<br>  To Gawain on that day when first they met.<br>  And when the song was done, she crav'd from these<br>  Freedom for all her train, and in exchange<br>  Offer'd her litter and rich hangings.  They,<br>  Won by the sweetness of the song, or fill'd<br>  With sudden madness never felt before,<br>  Gave all she ask'd and set their captives free.<br>  <br>  That night they lay on damp and mouldy straw<br>  Within a lowly hovel in the wood,<br>  And on the morrow would have gone once more<br>  Upon their quest had not a fever seiz'd<br>  The maid and held her fast; and good Sir Bors,<br>  Knowing the deadly fever of that land,<br>  Was ware the end was near.<br>  <br>                                       So past two days,<br>  And on the third they heard the jingling reins<br>  Of horses, and a train of knights and dames<br>  Drew near and stay'd to rest.  Sir Bors, alert,<br>  Amongst them spying Gawain close to one<br>  Whose name was lightly tost about the court,--<br>  The subtle Vivien,--pluckt him by the sleeve,<br>  Crying, "Come hence with me!" And Gawain went<br>  And after them stole Vivien, and the three,<br>  Ent'ring the hovel, came where Marjorie lay<br>  Moaning with fever on her bed of straw.<br>  She, feeling subtly the fine Gawain's eyes<br>  Upon her bent in wonder, open'd hers,<br>  Half rais'd herself, and stretching out her arms<br>  Toward him, gave a joyful cry, and past<br>  Without more utterance where no soul is vext<br>  With sighing or the myriad pains of earth.<br>  So died the maid Prince Gawain first had lov'd.<br>  <br>  He, when he saw the damsel dead, and heard<br>  The voice of good Sir Bors, "Your work, my Prince!"<br>  Had felt a pain much like remorse within,<br>  And would have stay'd to see that all was done<br>  Fitting the time and her, but Vivien came<br>  And wound her arms about his neck, and said<br>  This thing and that thing of her wiliness:<br>  So maz'd by Vivien was light Gawain's thought<br>  That he departed leaving all to Bors.<br>  <br>  Four days had end, and into Camelot<br>  Light Gawain rode with Vivien beside,<br>  But all the walls were hung with black, and all<br>  The bells made music doleful from their towers.<br>  Forth from the palace came a train of maids<br>  Chanting a hymn, and after, on a bier<br>  Pall'd all in samite blackness, lay the maid<br>  Whose love had been her doom.  King, queen, and court<br>  Pac'd slowly after, and King Arthur bent<br>  A brow of gloom on Gawain, but said naught.<br>  Then Gawain turn'd and follow'd the dark train<br>  Till all was done, the while the music roll'd<br>  Sadly above the head of Marjorie.<br>  Then, for the man was light, he past once more<br>  To his light loves; and all that was, became<br>  Erewhile to him as that which never hapt.<br>  Such honour Gawain did to Arthur's court.<br>
