O<br> I read it now.  St. GEORGE'S <i> Portico</i> !<br> The supreme head of all the world, where now<br> Knighthood liues honord with a crowned brow.<br> A noble <i> Scene</i> , and fit to shew him in<br> That must of all worlds fame the ghirland winne.<br> <br> 		LADY.<br> <br> Do's he not sit like MARS, or one that had<br> The better of him, in his armor clad?<br> And those his sixe assistants, as the pride<br> Of the old <i> Græcian Heroes</i>  had not died?<br> Or like APOLLO, raisd to the worlds view,<br> The minute after he the <i> Python</i>  slew.<br> <br> 		MERLIN.<br> <br> 'Tis all too little, LADY, you can speake.<br> My thought growes great of him, and faine would breake.<br> Inuite him forth, and guide him to his tent,<br> That I may read this shield his fates present.<br> <br> 		LADY.<br> <br> Glory of knights, and hope of all the earth,<br> Come forth; your fostresse bids; who from your birth<br> Hath bred you to this hower, and for this throne.<br> This is the field to make your vertue knowne.<br> 	If he were now (he sayes) to vow his fires<br> Of faith, of loue, of seruice, then his squires<br> Had vttered nothing for him:  But he hopes<br> In the first tender of himselfe, his scopes<br> Were so well read, as it were no decor'me,<br> Where truth is studied, there to practise forme.<br> <br> 		MERLIN.<br> <br> No, let his actions speake him; and this shield<br> Let downe from heauen, that to his youth will yeeld<br> Such copy of incitement:  Not the deedes<br> Of antique knights, to catch their fellowes steedes,<br> Or ladies palfreyes rescue from the force<br> Of a fell gyant, or some score to vn-horse.<br> These were bold stories of our ARTHVRS age;<br> But here are other acts; another <i> stage</i> <br> And <i> scene</i>  appeares; it is not since as then:<br> No gyants, dwarfes, or monsters here, but men.<br> His arts must be to gouerne, and giue lawes<br> To peace no lesse then armes.  His fate here drawes<br> An empire with it, and describes each state<br> Preceding there, that he should imitate.<br> 	First, faire MELIADVS, hath shee wrought an Ile,<br> The happiest of the earth (which to your stile<br> In time must adde) and in it placed high<br> <i> Britayne</i> , the only name, made CAESAR flie.<br> Within the neerer parts, as apt, and due<br> To your first speculation, you may view<br> The eye of <i> iustice</i>  shooting through the land,<br> Like a bright <i> planet</i>  strengthned by the hand<br> Of first, and warlike EDWARD; then th'increase<br> Of trades and tillage, vnder lawes and peace,<br> Begun by him, but settled and promou'd<br> By the third <i> Heroe</i>  of his name, who lou'd<br> To set his owne aworke, and not to see<br> The fatnesse of his land a portion bee<br> For strangers.  This was he erected first<br> The trade of clothing, by which arte were nurst<br> Whole millions to his seruice, and releeu'd<br> So many poore, as since they haue beleeu'd<br> The golden fleece, and need no forrayne mine,<br> If industrie at home doe not decline.<br> 	To proue which true, obserue what treasure here<br> The wise and seuenth HENRY heapt each yeere,<br> To be the strength and sinewes of a warre,<br> When MARS should thunder, or his peace but iarre,<br> And here how the eighth HENRY, his braue sonne,<br> Built forts, made generall musters, trayn'd youth on<br> In exercise of armes, and girt his coast<br> With strength; to which (whose fame no tongue can boast<br> Vp to her worth, though all best tongues be glad<br> To name her still) did great ELIZA adde<br> A wall of shipping, and became thereby<br> The ayde, or feare of all the nations nigh.<br> These, worthyest Prince, are set you neere to reade,<br> That ciuill arts the martiall must precede.<br> That lawes and trade bring honors in and gayne,<br> And armes defensiue a safe place maintayne.<br> But when your fate shall call you forth to'assure<br> Your vertue more (though not to make secure)<br> View here, what great examples shee hath plac'd.<br> 	First, two braue <i> Britayne Heroes</i> , that were grac'd<br> To fight their <i> Sauiours</i>  battailes, and did bring<br> Destruction on the faithlesse; one a king,<br> RICHARD, surnamed with the <i> lyons heart</i> .<br> The other, EDWARD, and the first, whose part<br> (Then being but Prince) it was to lead these warres<br> In the age after, but with better starres.<br> For here though <i> Coeur de lion</i>  like a storme<br> Powre on the <i> Saracens</i> , and doth performe<br> Deedes past an angell, arm'd with wroth and fire,<br> Ploughing whole armies vp, with zealous ire,<br> And walled cities, while he doth defend<br> That cause that should all warres begin and end;<br> Yet when with pride, and for humane respect<br> The <i> Austrian</i>  cullors he doth here deiect<br> With too much scorne, behold at length how fate<br> Makes him a wretched prisoner to that state;<br> And leaues him, as a marke of Fortunes spight,<br> When Princes tempt their starres beyond their light:<br> Whilst vpright EDWARD shines no lesse then he,<br> Vnder the wings of golden victorie,<br> Nor lets out no lesse riuers of the bloud<br> Of <i> Infidels</i> , but makes the field a floud,<br> And marches through it, with S. GEORGES crosse,<br> Like <i> Israels</i>  host to the <i> Ægyptians</i>  losse,<br> Through the <i> red sea</i> : the earth beneath him cold<br> And quaking such an enemie to behold.<br> For which, his temper'd zeale, see Prouidence<br> Flying in here, and armes him with defence<br> Against th'assassinate made vpon his life<br> By a foule wretch, from whom he wrests the knife,<br> And giues him a iust hire: which yet remaynes<br> A warning to great chiefes, to keepe their traynes<br> About 'hem still, and not, to priuacie,<br> Admit a hand that may vse treacherie.<br> 	Neerer then these, not for the same high cause,<br> Yet for the next (what was his right by lawes<br> Of nations due) doth fight that MARS of men,<br> The black Prince EDWARD, 'gainst the <i> French</i> , who then<br> At Cressey field had no more yeeres then you.<br> Here his glad father has him in the view<br> As he is entring in the schoole of warre,<br> And powres all blessings on him from a farre,<br> That wishes can; whilst he (that close of day)<br> Like a yong lyon, newly taught to prey,<br> Inuades the herds, so fled the <i> french</i> , and teares<br> From the <i> Bohemian</i>  crowne the plume he weares,<br> Which after for his crest he did preserue<br> To his fathers vse, with this fit word, <i> I SERVE</i> .<br> But here at <i> Poictiers</i>  he was MARS indeed.<br> Neuer did valour with more streame succeed<br> Then he had there.  He flow'd out like a sea<br> Vpon their troupes, and left their armes no way:<br> Or like a fire carryed with high windes,<br> Now broad, and spreading, by and by it findes<br> A vent upright, to looke which way to burne.<br> Then shootes along againe, or rounde doth turne,<br> Till in the circling spoile it hath embrac'd<br> All that stood nigh, or in the reach to wast:<br> Such was his rage that day; but then forgot<br> Soone as his sword was sheath'd, it lasted not,<br> After the King, the <i> Dauphine</i> , and <i> french</i>  Peeres<br> By yeelding to him, wisely quit their feares,<br> Whom he did vse with such humanitie,<br> As they complayn'd not of captiuitie;<br> But here to <i> England</i>  without shame came in.<br> To be his captiues was the next to win.<br> 	Yet rests the other thunder-bolt of warre,<br> HARRY the fift, to whom in face you are<br> So like, as <i> Fate</i>  would haue you so in worth,<br> Illustrious Prince.  This vertue ne're came forth,<br> But <i> Fame</i>  flue greater for him, then shee did<br> For other mortalls; <i> Fate</i>  her selfe did bid<br> To saue his life: The time it reach'd vnto,<br> Warre knew not how to giue'him enough to doe.<br> His very name made head against his foes.<br> And here at <i> Agin-Court</i>  where first it rose,<br> It there hangs still a comet ouer <i> France</i> ,<br> Striking their malice blind, that dare aduance<br> A thought against it, lightned by your flame<br> That shall succeed him both in deedes and name.<br> 	I could report more actions yet of weight<br> Out of this orbe, as here of <i> eightie eight</i> ,<br> Against the proud <i> Armada</i> , stil'd by <i> Spaine</i> ,<br> <i> The Inuincible</i> ; that couer'd all the mayne,<br> As if whole Ilands had broke loose, and swame;<br> Or halfe of <i> Norway</i>  with her firre-trees came,<br> To ioyne the continents, it was so great;<br> Yet by the auspice of ELIZA beat:<br> That deare-belou'd of heauen, whom to preserue<br> The windes were call'd to fight, and stormes to serue.<br> One tumor drown'd another, billowes stroue<br> To out-swell ambition, water ayre out-droue,<br> Though shee not wanted on that glorious day,<br> An euer-honor'd HOWARD to display<br> S.GEORGES ensigne; and of that high race<br> A second, both which ply'd the fight and chase:<br> And sent first bullets, then a fleet of fire,<br> Then shot themselues like ordinance; and a tire<br> Of ships for pieces, through the enemies moone,<br> That wan'd before it grew, and now they soone<br> Are rent, spoild, scatterd, tost with all disease,<br> And for their thirst of <i> Britayne</i>  drinke the seas.<br> The fish were neuer better fed than then,<br> Although at first they fear'd the bloud of men<br> Had chang'd their element; and NEPTVNE shooke<br> As if the Thunderer had his palace tooke.<br> 	So here in <i> Wales</i> , <i> Low Countries</i> , <i> France</i> , and <i> Spayne</i> ,<br> You may behold both on the land and mayne<br> The conquests got, the spoiles, the <i> trophæes</i>  reard<br> By <i> British</i>  kings, and such as noblest heard<br> Of all the nation, which may make to'inuite<br> Your valure vpon need, but not to'incite<br> Your neighbour Princes, giue them all their due,<br> And be prepar'd if they will trouble you.<br> He doth but scourge him selfe, his sword that drawes<br> Without a purse, a counsaile and a cause.<br> 	But all these spurres to vertue, seedes of praise<br> Must yeeld to this that comes.  Here's one will raise<br> Your glorie more, and so aboue the rest,<br> As if the acts of all mankind were prest<br> In his example.  Here are kingdomes mixt<br> And nations ioyn'd, a strength of empire fixt<br> Conterminate with heauen;  The golden veine<br> Of SATVRNES age is here broke out againe.<br> HENRY but ioyn'd the <i> Roses</i> , that ensign'd<br> Particular families, but this hath ioyn'd<br> The <i> Rose</i>  and <i> Thistle</i> , and in them combin'd<br> A vnion, that shall neuer be declin'd.<br> <i> Ireland</i>  that more in title, then in fact<br> Before was conquer'd, is his <i> Lawrels</i>  act.<br> The wall of shipping by ELIZA made,<br> Decay'd (as all things subiect are to fade)<br> He hath new built, or so restor'd, that men<br> For noble vse, preferre it afore then:<br> <i> Royall</i> , and <i> mightie</i>  IAMES, whose name shall set<br> A goale for all posteritie to sweat,<br> In running at, by actions hard and high:<br> This is the height at which your thoughts must fly.<br> He knowes both how to gouerne, how to saue,<br> What subiects, what their <i> contraries</i>  should haue,<br> What can be done by power, and what by loue,<br> What should to <i> Mercie</i> , what to <i> Iustice</i>  moue:<br> All <i> Arts</i>  he can, and from the hand of <i> Fate</i> <br> Hath he enforc'd the making of his owne date.<br> Within his proper vertue hath he plac'd<br> His guards 'gainst <i> Fortune</i> , and there fixed fast<br> The wheele of <i> chance</i> , about which Kings are hurl'd,<br> And whose outragious raptures fill the world.<br> <br> 		LADY.<br> <br> I, This is hee, MELIADVS, whom you<br> Must only serue, and giue your selfe vnto:<br> And by your diligent practice to obay<br> So wise a Master learne the arte of sway.<br> 	MERLIN, aduance the shield vpon his tent.<br> And now prepare, faire Knight, to proue th'euent<br> Of your bold <i> Challenge</i> .  Bee your vertue steeld,<br> And let your drumme giue note you keepe the field.<br> Is this the land of <i> Britaine</i>  so renowned<br> For deeds of <i> Armes</i> , or are their hearings drownd<br> That none doe answere?<br> <br> 		MERLIN.<br> <br> 		Stay, me thinkes I see<br> A person in yond' <i> caue</i> .  Who should that bee?<br> I know her ensignes now: 'Tis <i> Cheualrie</i> <br> Possess'd with sleepe, dead as a <i> lethargie</i> :<br> If any <i> charme</i>  will wake her, 'tis the name<br> Of our MELIADVS.  I'll vse his <i> Fame</i> .<br> 	<i> Lady</i> , MELIADVS, lord of the Iles,<br> Princely MELIADVS, and whom <i> Fate</i>  now stiles<br> The faire MELIADVS, hath hung his shield<br> Vpon his tent, and here doth keepe the field,<br> According to his bold and princely word;<br> And wants employment for his pike, and sword.<br> <br> 		CHEVALRY.<br> <br> Were it from death that name would wake mee.  Say<br> Which is the Knight?  O I could gaze a day<br> Vpon his armour that hath so reuiu'd<br> My spirits, and tels me that I am long liu'd<br> In his apparance.  Breake, you rustie dores,<br> That haue so long beene shut, and from the shores<br> Of all the world, come knight-hood like a flood<br> Vpon these lists, to make the field, here, good,<br> And your owne honours, that are now call'd forth<br> Against the wish of men to proue your worth.<br> <br> 		THE BARRIERS.<br> 	<i> After which</i>  MERLIN <i> speakes</i> .<br> <br> Nay, stay your valure, 'tis a wisdome high<br> In Princes to vse fortune reuerently.<br> He that in deeds of <i> Armes</i>  obeyes his blood<br> Doth often tempt his destinie beyond good.<br> Looke on this throne, and in his temper view<br> The light of all that must haue grace in you:<br> His equall <i> Iustice</i> , vpright <i> Fortitude</i> <br> And settled <i> Prudence</i> , with that Peace indued<br> Of face, as minde, alwayes himselfe and euen.<br> So HERCVLES, and good men beare vp <i> heauen</i> .<br> 	I dare not speake his vertues for the feare<br> Of flattring him, they come so high and neare<br> To wonders: yet thus much I prophesy<br> Of him and his.  All eares your selues apply.<br> 	You, and your other you, great King and Queene,<br> Haue yet the least of your bright <i> Fortune</i>  seene,<br> Which shal rise brighter euery houre with <i> Time</i> ,<br> And in your pleasure quite forget the crime<br> Of change; your ages night shall be her noone.<br> And this yong Knight, that now puts forth so soone<br> Into the world, shall in your names atchieue<br> More <i> ghyrlands</i>  for this state, and shall relieue<br> Your cares in gouernment; while that yong lord<br> Shall second him in <i> Armes</i> , and shake a sword<br> And launce against the foes of God and you.<br> Nor shall lesse ioy your royall hopes pursue<br> In that most princely <i> Mayd</i> , whose forme might call<br> The world to warre, and make it hazard all<br> His valure for her beautie, she shall bee<br> Mother of <i> nations</i> , and her Princes see<br> Riuals almost to these.  Whilst you sit high,<br> And lead by them, behold your <i> Britaine</i>  fly<br> Beyond the line, when what the seas before<br> Did bound, shall to the sky then stretch his shore.<br>
