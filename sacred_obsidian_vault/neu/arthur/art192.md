I know not,<br> The twain are so wrought in one;<br> But whether for joy or for sorrow,<br> The sands of our fate must run--<br> And what matter if men condemn us quite,<br> Since all the world shall be ours to-night?"<br> <br> <br> 	SIR PERCEVAL<br> <br> <br> "I ride adown the forest aisles<br>    From morn till evening shade,<br> Beneath the stars of heaven my head,<br>    At fall of night, is laid.<br> No comrade wendeth at my side,<br>    No voice bids me God-speed,<br> Alone by hill and vale I ride,<br>    Alone by wood and mead.<br> <br> "For somewhere, near, or far away,<br>    One waiteth long mine aid,<br> I may not rest, by night or day,<br>    Until his grief be stayed.<br> For many a year, with prayer and tear,<br>    I've sought to find the way,<br> But rough or smooth, the path I choose<br>    Still leadeth me astray.<br> <br> "I may not rest from off my quest,<br>    I may not stay my hand,<br> Tho' Life and Love be waiting me,<br>   Far in a distant land.<br> I may not see my wife's fair face,<br>    I may not faint nor fail,<br> Till I have won Anfortas grace,<br>    And found the Holy Grail."<br> <br> <br> .	.	.	.	.	.	.	.	.<br> <br> <br> Sir Gawayne hath sought the isles of light<br>    Beyond the shores of day,<br> Where morn never waneth to shades of night,<br>    And the silver fountains play;<br> There he holdeth high court as the Maidens' Knight,<br>    In the Maidens' Isle, for aye.<br> <br> And Tristan sleeps by his lady's side,<br>    To the dirge of the sounding sea;<br> And the foaming wave and the flowing tide<br>    Hide the twain, that no man may see<br> Where they take their rest, and their fate abide,<br>    Till the dawn of Eternity.<br> <br> But Lancelot wrought a penance hard<br>    To win from his sin release,<br> And his face was by fast and vigil marred<br>    Or ever his pain might cease.<br> Now his body lieth in Joyous Gard,<br>    And his soul hath gotten peace.<br> <br> And Perceval, doth he wake or sleep?<br>    Ah, no man shall tell that tale--<br> Perchance he lieth in slumber deep<br>    With the Eastern sands for veil;<br> Or perchance, in a distant land, doth keep<br>    Watch and ward o'er the Holy Grail.<br> <br> But when the archangel trump shall call,<br>    And the Heavenly Feast be spread,<br> Say, which of those heroes, among them all,<br>    Shall lift up a fearless head,<br> And walk the pavement of Heaven's high Hall<br>    With unashamèd tread?<br> <br> Sir Gawayne, methinks, shall hide his face,<br>    Abashed and overawed,<br> And the lovers twain, by Jesu's grace,<br>    Sit low at the Heavenly board;<br> But the King of Heaven shall rise from His place<br>    When He seeth Monsalväsch' lord--<br> <br> "Welcome, O Brother, who bare thy part<br>    In the travail of My soul,<br> Who knew no rest of hand or heart<br>    Till thy brother might be made whole;<br> Come thou, and sit at My side, apart,<br>    While the stars 'neath our footstool roll."<br>
