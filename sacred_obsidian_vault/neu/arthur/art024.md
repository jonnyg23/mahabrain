 <p align="center">  INTRODUCTION.  <br>      </p>      
 <p> The following prefatory remarks appeared in the issue of this work in 1914,        and are now inserted without alteration, although in some points the matter,        through the lapse of time, has naturally become out of date.<br>      </p>      
 <p align="center">  __________________</p>      
 <p align="center"> <br>        PREFACE. <br>      </p>      
 <p> When "Music Drama of the Future" was published nearly three years ago it        seemed unlikely that the ideal of a Temple Theatre, as we called it, could        be realised in our time. <br>        <br>        As I write this preface to a popular re-issue of the text of "The Birth        of Arthur," arrangements are well in hand for the erection of a temporary        building, adequate to its purpose, and the establishment of a Glastonbury        Festival, at the town associated with the life and death of the hero. The        foundation stone is to be laid this year. <br>        <br>        Further, the scheme has received the recognition and open good wishes of        Sir Edward Elgar, Sir Frederick Pollock, Sir Henry J. Wood, Granville Bantock,        W.L. Courtney, Bernard Shaw and St. Loe Strachey, to mention only a few        persons representative of different phases of life, while the names of Lena        Ashwell and Lillah McCarthy emphasise the fact that it tends to no narrow        hero-worship, but that Woman too shall have her part in this drama of Motherhood        and Manhood. <br>        <br>        The music of my collaborator, Rutland Boughton, is considered by Sir Edward        Elgar to be "worthy of the great subject that you have chosen." Of the poem        itself you can judge, remembering that only by performance can it become        truly alive. <br>        <br>        The artists who have shown themselves willing to appear include Frederic        Austin, Francis Harford and Mrs. Tobias Matthay, while the problem of the        chorus has been solved in a manner that should guarantee efficiency. <br>        <br>        Meanwhile the musical part of the work has not been neglected. As long ago        as 1909 an orchestral excerpt was played at a Leeds symphony concert under        Mr. Fricker's direction. <br>        <br>        Mr. Thomas Beecham's orchestra gave an excerpt from the second act at Birmingham        last year, and a very generous offer of assistance from him is one of the        pillars upon which the coming Glastonbury Festival rests. <br>        <br>        In August (1913), at Bournemouth, Mr. Boughton, with the kind help of Mr.        Dan Godfrey and his band, organised a scenic production of excerpts. This,        largely owing to his use of "human staging," caused widespread notice, for        which we thank the Press, which invariably shows interest when something        is brought to pass in visible form. <br>        <br>        At that juncture we gained the co-operation of Miss Margaret Morris, who        is to be responsible for the Glastonbury production, jointly with the composer.        This staging, together with the use of choral dance, is a success experimentally,        and will be tried on a large scale for the first time. At Glastonbury itself        the Mayor and a number of representative citizens have ensured the public        nature of the scheme, and Miss Alice Buckton, author of "Eager Heart," has        helped us. <br>        <br>        We are not building for ourselves. The "Birth of Arthur" is to symbolise        the birth of new hopes, new works and aims. <br>        <br>        The Glastonbury Festival idea has been regarded in many quarters as a "British        Bayreuth." <br>        <br>        This is a convenient term, but not a correct one. <br>        <br>        First, as regards our Arthurian cycle (four dramas, of which "The Birth        of Arthur" is the first); it differs technically in several essentials from        the "Ring": in staging; in choral treatment; and in poetic method. <br>        <br>        Second, the people of the locality will find artistic scope in the productions.        <br>        <br>        Thirdly, the theatre will have quite a different kind of stage. <br>        <br>        Here is the Word (or at least the "words"). <br>        <br>        At this season it would seem impious to doubt this hero birth for which        the whole soul longs. <br>      </p>
