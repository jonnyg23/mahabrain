Uther's mighty son<br>  Had put forth all his strength, and all in vain.<br>  Fate was his foes' ally; and Fate had won<br>  The battle.  All around him on the plain<br>  Lay the stark bodies of his warriors slain,<br>  With faces to the sky and wounds in front.<br>  They echoed not his war-cry to their wont.<br>  <br>     Oh, day of anguish!  Strange and awful day<br>  Of pain more piercing than the pain of wounds,--<br>  Wounds scarcely felt, numbed by the great dismay<br>  Unspeakable that a great soul astounds,--<br>  His soul that, never taught in any strife<br>  Before to spell the ungly word <i> defeat</i> ,<br>  Just in the very crisis of his life,<br>  Hath done his best of bests but to be foiled,<br>  He knows not why, and strives and strives amain<br>  But to be beaten o'er and o'er again,<br>  His onslaughts baffled and his standard moiled!<br>  <br>     And Launcelot was not there, nor Lionel,<br>  Villyars, nor Melyas brave, nor Sir Lavayne;<br>  They who erewhile around him fought so well,<br>  With many another, now were worse than slain.<br>  Treason had broken up the Table Round.<br>  He who can patch burst bubbles on the mere,<br>  Let him old broken fellowships make sound,<br>  By discord sundered,--once how leal and dear!--<br>  And he who hath the power, by witchcraft deft,<br>  The crumbled eggs the cuckoo's beak hath cleft,<br>  Filled with new life, without a scar to mend,<br>  Bid him with magic skill to join once more<br>  The ties undone, once knit through friend to friend,<br>  Round heart and heart as closely as before.<br>  <br>     Still Arthur fought and struggled, e'en as one<br>  Fights with a grisly dream and strives to wake.<br>  He saw that he was more and more alone.<br>  A spell was on him that he could not break.<br>  He called on Galahad and Percivale,<br>  And then remembered they had long been dead.<br>  He rallying led his dwindling squadrons on,<br>  That melted as the surf upon the rock,<br>  And set his lonely breast to meet the shock<br>  Of foemen still more swarming to make head<br>  Against him; for 'tis something, not to quail,<br>  When comes the time no longer to prevail.<br>  <br>     And Mordred marked,-- his kinsman traitor black,--<br>  And bode his time; till Arthur 'gainst an oak<br>  His heaving shoulder leaned a breathing-space.<br>  He dared not look him in the royal face,<br>  But ran behind and stabbed him in the back,<br>  As  the sly coward snake doth glide and sting,<br>  Then fled content.  Oh, kindred glaives cut deep!<br>  <br>     As the shot stag his antlers high doth fling,<br>  So threw his hands aloft the stricken king,<br>  And fell at last.  He fell and rose no more,<br>  Pierced to the soul,-- oh, kindred steel stabs sore!--<br>  While unawares a cry from out him broke<br>  Of more than any fleshly pang, and woke<br>  Sir Lucan and Sir Bedivere, who lay<br>  Fast in a deathly swoon, and made them leap,<br>  Two ghastly wights, as from two graves two ghosts<br>  All pale and wavering, quick to seize on him<br>  And steal him from the trampling of the hosts.<br>  They reared the mighty frame; each drooping limb<br>  They gathered up.  O'erpowered beneath the weight,<br>  Fell Lucan back, and breathed his last life out,<br>  With patient looks, before his master's feet.<br>  <br>     And Arthur saw and moaned, with sobbing breath,<br>  "Oh, loyal,--dear,-- oh, trusty one!-- thy death,--<br>  I thank thee,-- makes death easier unto me.<br>  Hark,-- nearer,-- hear the rebels how they shout!<br>  Go, leave me, Bedivere; and save one life.<br>  Mine canst thou not; nor would I that thou shouldst,<br>  Having lost all that makes it life to live.<br>  Win bays hereafter in some happier strife.<br>  To-day and aye, thou hast done all thou couldst."<br>  <br>     He gasped away to dumbness; and again<br>  Strove Bedivere to lift him from the plain,<br>  But could not till he'd stripped him of his mail,<br>  Helm, shield, and breast-plate,-- weakly then did heave<br>  His master up.  Excalybur 'gan trail<br>  Down from his hand, and still a furrow ploughed<br>  Unevenly along the dust, as slow<br>  The knight set staggering footsteps one by one,<br>  With head bent down and burdened shoulders bowed.<br>  King Arthur could not lift, nor would let go,<br>  The mystic sword,-- not yet,-- till, on a strand,<br>  A ruined chapel, buried half in sand<br>  And half in ivy, met and took them in.<br>  They saw themselves unseen and all alone;<br>  And their stunned ears were sheltered from the din<br>  Of following battle.  Panting Bedivere<br>  Stooped lower still, and eased him of his load,<br>  And laid his sovereign on a tomb, both broad<br>  And long, above the nettles which there grew,<br>  And loosed his sinews from their cramp and ache.<br>  <br>     And Arthur writhed his neck; the gathering dew<br>  He sucked from the cold stone; and thus he spake:<br>  <br>     "So!-- Good it is for me that I am here.<br>  My goodly knights are earth on the dead earth;<br>  Myself henceforth am only a dead knight,--<br>  Dead in their deaths more dear than life to me,--<br>  And I shall never be myself again!<br>  Oh, Bedivere, a kinsman's blade is keen!<br>  My woful body's homesick for the mould.<br>  Fast draws on me a never-waking sleep;<br>  And soon my burning fever shall be cold.<br>  Mourn not; for thus Death ever followed Birth<br>  Since first the hapless race of Man began;<br>  Thus shall it ever do till Time shall end.<br>  Mine eyes grows dim; and, throbbing on my ear,<br>  I hear the beating of a shoreless sea.<br>  Pray for my soul.-- Thou art not gone?-- O friend,<br>  One service more,-- one only,-- do thy lord.<br>  Take, Bedivere, and drown, my vanquished sword<br>  Where never man shall look upon it more;<br>  Hurl't from some beetling cliff the waters o'er;<br>  Then lightly bring me word if aught thou seest."<br>  <br>     Sir Bedivere went sadly forth to turn<br>  His beaded forehead to the windy west.<br>  The sun was setting, angry, wild, and red,<br>  Going like a wounded warrior to his bed,<br>  With threats of rising to a fiercer morn.<br>  A double sunset weltered in the flood;<br>  And swam beneath his feet a sea of blood,<br>  As on the brink he stood.  With stronger hold<br>  He clutched Excalybur, and slowly wound<br>  The baldrick rich the jewelled hilt around,<br>  And took a parting look at all the gold,<br>  Emeralds, pearls, rubies,-- looked again below<br>  Among the waves, considering where to throw,<br>  Then at the sword,-- till, gazing to and fro,<br>  He said, "King Arthur's crazed with wounds and woe,<br>  And knows not what he'd have.  The leech's skill<br>  Oft serves the sick man's weal against his will;<br>  And so must I.  He will be healed anon.<br>  His troops will rally.  If his sword be gone,<br>  I shall be sorely blamed, with reason, when<br>  He strides in steel once more before his men,<br>  And Future cancels Past;-- for, sad or gay,<br>  To-morrow never will be as To-day."<br>  <br>     He looked behind him; and a hollow tree<br>  Stood lke a beckoning sentry on a height:<br>  "Here shall Excalybur in safety be<br>  Until my lord demands it back of me."<br>  He thrust it up the trunk and, from the sight<br>  Of hind or fisherman by Chance led by,<br>  Smothered its sparkles close, with sea-weeds dry,<br>  Then hurried to his master languishing.<br>  And "Hast thou done my errand?" sighed the king.<br>  <br>     With looks askance, as one unused to lie,<br>  And faltering tongue, Sir Bedivere said, "Ay."<br>  <br>     "What saw'st thou?"<br>  <br>     "Naught but waves that fawned, and licked,<br>  Like hungry hounds, the wet feet of the rocks."<br>  <br>     Upstarting to his elbow, "Am I tricked,"<br>  Cried Arthur, "on my death-bed, and by thee?<br>  Know that a dying king is still a king!"<br>  Straight find my sword, and in the waters fling;<br>  Or I!"-- His wounds burst forth afresh; and he<br>  Sank back in speechless rage, with eyes that glared.<br>  <br>     And Bedivere, "'Twas for thy sake, I dared<br>  To disobey.  I did but for the best";<br>  And, more than his mild words, his loyal face,<br>  Dyed with unwonted shame, did plead for him,<br>  And with his master well-nigh made his peace.<br>  <br>     "Then go and do thy best,-- not '<i> for</i>  the best';<br>  <i> That</i>  often is the worst."<br>  <br>     "I go, thy hest,<br>  My dearest liege, most throughly to fulfil;<br>  Yet oh, bethink thee once!  The matchless brand<br>  Alone of all befits thy matchless hand;<br>  And thou mayst sorely miss it yet one day,<br>  When the vain mermen with it sport and play.<br>  Take heart, and live.  These hurts are not to death."<br>  <br>     Moaned Arthur: "Wouldst thou waste my parting breath,<br>  Due all to prayers?  Go thou, and do my will.<br>  Mine arm is broken; and my veins are drained.<br>  To everything on earth there comes an end.<br>  O comrade, comrade, kinsmen's cuts are keen,<br>  I shall never do my best again!<br>  I tell thee it is time for me to die.<br>  But if I lived to sit at slothful ease,<br>  Mid women and their works, as Hercules<br>  Of yore behind the wheel of Omphale,<br>  Would the brave sword be a reproach to me,<br>  And on the wall hang like mine effigy."<br>  <br>     Sir Bedivere unto the seashore hied.<br>  The west was paling like a dying man.<br>  He peered into the hollow trunk.  A spark,--<br>  A diamond,-- twinkled downward through the dark<br>  And rubbish, that to hide it vainly tried.<br>  Excalybur came forth; and he began<br>  Anew its jewelled hilt and sheath to scan,<br>  Till failed his heart once more; for every gem<br>  Seemed to him like an angry tear to flash,<br>  With wrathful lightnings through the gathering gloom,<br>  As chafing hotly at the unworthy doom,<br>  That gave it brine for blood.  "I cannot do 't"<br>  With answering tears he said; "Oh, 'twere too rash!<br>  My king himself, too late, the deed would chide<br>  And claim his weapon of the unyielding tide.<br>  And, when thus recklessly away we cast<br>  From us the sacred heirlooms of the past,<br>  We throw away our past that cleaves to them.<br>  He will be whole and cheered, and on his throne<br>  Sit calmly, come again unto his own,<br>  With wise gray heads around the council-board;<br>  And they will lift slow eyes from scroll and seal<br>  And chartered ordinance for the public weal,<br>  To see the glory of the mighty sword<br>  Fling from the wall its mystic splendours down<br>  Confronted with the sceptre and the crown;<br>  And they will smile and say, 'All things in turn.<br>  He is scarce greater now than in his morn,--<br>  In counsel than, in youth, he was in war.--<br>  Behold the witness there, Excalybur.'<br>  And he may leave it to a doughty son,<br>  When all his earthly deeds in sooth are done."<br>  He gave it back unto the hollow thorn,<br>  And sought the ruin with a fearful foot.<br>  <br>     "Now hast thou done my biding?-- Sawst thou aught?"<br>  <br>     Sir Bedivere made answer, "Nay" and "Naught;<br>  But hear me."<br>  <br>     Groaned the king, "I cannot hear.<br>  Will none obey?  Oh, is 't too late?-- too late!--<br>  Methougtht it lay in me to conquer Fate.<br>  Why heeds me no one?  Where are all my train?"<br>  He moaned aloud, scarce witting what he said.<br>  <br>     The knight knelt down and sobbed: "Oh, master dear,<br>  Dost thou not know me?  I am Bedivere."<br>  <br>     "I know thee not.  The man who bore that name<br>  Was true and trusty to me."<br>  <br>     "I, the same."<br>  <br>     "Prove it.  If Arthur can command no more,<br>  Then, in my utmost need will I implore:<br>  Spare not Excalybur, but cast it in.<br>  To mock a dying man, it is a sin.<br>  My heart is broken; and my hope is dead."<br>  <br>     Then saw the knight, that it was all in vain.<br>  With tottering speed unto the cliffs he ran.<br>  Now all the glow was quenched within the sky;<br>  But, o'er the sea, a light sepulchral gleamed<br>  Like corpse-lights o'er the graves of buried men.<br>  He dared not face the magic sword again,<br>  But, groping, tore it forth and hurled it high<br>  And far; when, lo, a wonder!  For there seemed<br>  A hand and arm,--no human hand and arm!--<br>  To start to meet the hilt from out a wave;<br>  And thrice they brandishèd the mystic glaive,<br>  Then vanished with it, as if they a charm<br>  Had wrought, of meaning never to be told.<br>  <br>     He flew unto his master.  "It is done!"<br>  He panted.<br>  <br>     Him King Arthur answered not.<br>  The knight stooped quick unto him, as he lay;<br>  Like the dim shimmer of a mist-quenched moon,<br>  The phantom of a dying smile was caught,<br>  And seen the questioning of a speechless look,<br>  Most eager.<br>  <br>     "When I threw thy sword away,<br>  This marvel did my watery eyes behold:<br>  A hand and arm from out the billows broke,<br>  And caught and brandished it with threefold sweep,<br>  Then drew it down with them into the deep."<br>  <br>     And Arthur lifted up his trembling hands,<br>  Like a sick infant, with the dumb commands<br>  Of helplessness, when it would carried be,<br>  And pointed where he heard the sounding sea;<br>  And bearing him, with toil and travail sore,<br>  His loyal liegeman reached again the shore.<br>  <br>     A cloud came forth out of the cloudy west;<br>  And in its darkness darkling shapes took shape,<br>  Till, ere they found the shuddering Bedivere,<br>  He dimly might descry a sable barge<br>  That held right on without an oar or sail;<br>  And those within it sang a hollow dirge;<br>  And, as it neared him, 'mid the shadowy crew,<br>  The black-stoled Queen of North Galys he knew,<br>  And her of the Waste Lands; and loud did weep,<br>  Morgan le Fay, King Arthur's sister, wail,<br>  And beat her breast between them.<br>  <br>     Straight her veil<br>  Blew over the knight's eyes; and, lo, his charge<br>  Was gone out of his arms, he wist not how!<br>  He stood forsaken on the strand, and cried,<br>  "My lord, my loved, come back!  What should I do<br>  Not serving thee?  Come back!  What should betide<br>  Me lonely in the emptied world?  If fled<br>  From it forever, take me!-- Take my  breath,<br>  Dark spirits!"--<br>  <br>     Faint and far, from o'er the surge,<br>  King Arthur answered with the voice of death,<br>  "Look to thyself.  Heaven help thee!  I am sped.<br>  I go unto the Isle of Avalon;<br>  For there they say, at last I shall find rest<br>  For all my stormy years of sovereignty."<br>  <br>  <br>                 Part II.<br>  <br>     King Arthur sailed along a sea unknown.<br>  Met him the misty Night, and drew him in<br>  Unto the cherishing shelter of her breast.<br>  He glided onward toward the land of rest.<br>  In his parched throat, his burning thirst was drowned<br>  By draughts of coolness, brought by hands unseen.<br>  Upon his long-lost mother's lap, his head,<br>  Worn out with toil and woe, was softly laid,--<br>  Or so he deemed.  Her tender palms were pressed<br>  Unto his temples; and his brow was kissed<br>  By her fond lips, that murmured love and peace<br>  As in some shildish sickness long ago.<br>  Far Uther called before, "Well done,-- well done!<br>  Here grow thy laurels, son,-- my worthy son!"<br>  The waves sang lullabies to him, and rocked<br>  His weary frame all bruised and battle-shocked,<br>  And soothed it slowly into slumberous ease;<br>  And thus he slept, to wake in Avalon,--<br>  If waking e'er was calm as any dream,--<br>  Half wake, and sleep again.<br>  <br>     Around did seem,<br>  Or were, his knights all laid, as oft of yore<br>  In lusty bivouac; but frost or snow<br>  Or wind or rattling hail came nigh no more.<br>  Sunrise and sunset, these made all their day.<br>  Around them, for the most part, moonbeams lay<br>  Exchanging watch with starlight, to the sound<br>  Of rippling brooks, that played a harmony<br>  Unto the nightingales' weird melody,<br>  Or to the distant surgings of the surf<br>  Below them, where they pressed some steep's scant turf.<br>  No uttered speech among them now was there,<br>  Nor any need of speech amid the dear<br>  Unuttered sympathy of love and cheer.<br>  In sentient trance, without a look or word,<br>  He saw the vanished and the voiceless heard.<br>  Heart answered unto heart, and mind to mind,<br>  In a most eloquent silence.  Now a hymn<br>  Swelled upward from the soul of Galahad,<br>  And lulled King Arthur with its sweetness dim;<br>  And now he laughed in slumber at some whim<br>  That, tickling, crossed the freakish brain of Kay.<br>  <br>     Sometimes they round him camped, in many a tent,<br>  Whereon soft rains their drowsy patterings spent,<br>  With cosey whisperings bidding still their sleep,<br>  In shelter snug, to grow more sound and deep,<br>  (The dog that loved him once, and died in pain,<br>  Slept at his feet or licked his hand again.)<br>  Sometimes they rested in a curchyard calm,<br>  A troop of spirits, on the graves' thick grass.<br>  Sometimes amid a minister's painted glooms<br>  They seemed to lie, (like Templars on their tombs),<br>  And he among them carved, a marble knight,<br>  To hear, within the sacred candles' light,<br>  The holy choirs unseen chant laud or psalm.<br>  No more was he forsaken anywhere.<br>  <br>     At first he heard the voices of his foes<br>  That, on their hurried way, seemed nigh to pass<br>  Ere, into silence swept away, they went<br>  Before a judgment-seat, where Justice sat<br>  And waited them.  Sir Lancelot, following, wrung<br>  Unmailèd hands and,  with a noiseless tongue,<br>  Forgiveness asked, with eyes that gazed through tears<br>  And rained remorseful sorrow o'er his woes.<br>  All Arthur's wrath was melted straight thereat;<br>  And, through his sleep, he murmured his assent<br>  With answering tears of pity; and anon<br>  Foes and their bitteer memories were gone;<br>  Not any lingering rancour left behind,<br>  Nor any power to vex him more they had.<br>  <br>     No longer haunted him light Guinevere;<br>  But watching o'er him often did appear<br>  Instead, his boyhood's love, her sister fair,<br>  Who loved him, only him, and loved him well,--<br>  Sweet maid, too early crowned with asphodel.--<br>  <br>     The joy of youth came back to him.  He thrilled<br>  With growing powers that all his being filled.<br>  Each innocent Yearning that was starved to death<br>  Erst, by the hard conditions of this life,<br>  Arose new-born, and smiled on him full-fed.<br>  Despair in turn was killed and, deep beneath<br>  The past's old ruins, buried by the years;<br>  And anywhere was balm, and nowhere strife.<br>  <br>     So still he sleeps, and does not care to wake;<br>  But Merlin saith, at length a day shall break<br>  And ripen onward to another noon<br>  When, master of his fate and blithe and whole,<br>  And all renewed in body, mind, and soul,<br>  King Arthur, with his knights, shall come again,<br>  To weild Excalybur, and not in vain.<br>
