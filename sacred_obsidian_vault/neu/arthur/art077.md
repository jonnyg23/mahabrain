From the east came, then,<br>  Cerdic the Saxon a seven-year thereafter;<br>  The excellent atheling, offspring of Woden<br>  Came into Albion.  His own dear land<br>  Lay off to the eastward out o'er the sea-ways,<br>  Far o'er the flood-deeps.  His fair-haired, eagle-eyed<br>  Liegeman and son sailed westwardly,<br>  O'er the flint-gray floods, with his father and liegelord,<br>  O'er the dashing, lashing, dark-flowing currents<br>  That roll and roar, rumble, grumble<br>  Eastward of Albion.  Not e'er hath been told me<br>  Of sea-goers twain trustier, doughtier<br>  Than Cerdic and Cynric, who sailed o'er the waters<br>  Valiant, invincible vikings and sea-dogs<br>  Seeking adventure.  Swift westwardly,<br>  O'er the fallow floods, fared they to Albion,<br>  Would look for the land that liegemen-kinsmen<br>  Of Hengist and Horsa and high-mooded Aella<br>  And Cissa had come to.  Cerdic was mighty,<br>  Earl of the Saxons.  His excellent barks,<br>  His five good floats, fanned by the breezes,<br>  Gliding the waters were wafted to Albion,<br>  Ocean-encircled isle of the sea-waves,<br>  Delightsomest of lands.  Lay then at anchor<br>  The five good keels close to the sea-shore;<br>  The swans of the sea sat on the water<br>  Close by the cliff-edge.  The clever folk-leader<br>  Was boastful and blithesome, brave-mooded Saxon,<br>  Said to his earlmen: "Excellent thanes<br>  True-hearted, trusty table-companions,<br>  See the good land the loving, generous<br>  Gods have given you: go, seize on it.<br>  I and my son have sailed westwardly,<br>  To gain with our swords such goodly possessions<br>  As Hengist and Aella did erstwhile win<br>  On the island of Albion.  On to the battle,<br>  The foe confronteth us."  Folk of the island,<br>  Earlmen of Albion, angry-mooded, then,<br>  Stood stoutly there, striving to hurl them<br>  Off in the ocean east to the mainland,<br>  Back o'er the billows.  Bravely Albion's<br>  Fearless defenders fought with the stranger<br>  Then and thereafter: early did Cerdic<br>  See and declare that slowly, bloodily,<br>  And foot by foot, must the folk of the Saxons<br>  Tear from the Welsh their well-lovèd, blithesome,<br>  Beautiful fatherland.  Brave were the men that<br>  So long could repel the puissant, fearless<br>  Sons of the Saxons that had sailed o'er the oceans<br>  To do or to die, doughty, invincible<br>  Earls of the east.  The excellent kinsmen,<br>  Father and son, scions of Woden,<br>  Burned in their spirit to build in the south the<br>  Greatest of kingdoms: 't was granted to Cerdic<br>  To be first of the famous folk-lords of Wessex,<br>  Land-chiefs belovèd; to lead, herald the<br>  World-famous roll of the wise, eminent<br>  Athelings of Wessex, where Egbert and Ethelwulf,<br>  Alfred and Edward, ever resplendently,<br>  Spaciously shine, shepherds of peoples,<br>  Excellent athelings, and Athelstan, Godwin<br>  And Harold the hero, helms of the Saxons,<br>  Have their names written in record of glory<br>  In legend and story, leaving their fame as an<br>  Honor forever to England, peerless<br>  Mother of heroes.--The men of the east<br>  Slowly, bloodily builded a kingdom<br>  Where Aesc and Aella not e'er had been able<br>  To bear their banners, though both these athelings<br>  Were in might marvellous, mood-brave, heroic<br>  Leaders of liegemen.--Beloved of the Welsh<br>  Was the atheling Arthur, excellent, valiant<br>  Lord of the Silurians, land-prince, warrior<br>  Famed 'mid the races.  He rued bitterly<br>  That father and son, Saxon invaders,<br>  To the left and right were wresting, tearing<br>  From races no few their fond-lovèd, blood-bought<br>  Homesteads and manors, were hacking and sacking<br>  Folk of the southland, and far westwardly<br>  Had bitterly banished the best of the heroes<br>  And earlmen of Albion.  Arthur was mighty,<br>  Uther Pendragon's offspring belovèd,<br>  His fame far-reaching.  Afar and anear then,<br>  All men of Albion honored and loved him;<br>  Sent over Severn beseeching the mighty<br>  Silurian leader no longer to tarry<br>  In crushing the foemen, but quickly to drive them<br>  Back to their bottomless bogs in the eastward<br>  O'er the rime-cold sea; said wailingly:<br>  "The fierce, pitiless folk of the eastward,<br>  Mighty, remorseless men of the waters,<br>  Treacherous, terrible, will take speedily<br>  Our name and nation, and naught will be left us<br>  But to dare and to die."  The doughty, invincible<br>  Atheling Arthur, earl of Siluria,<br>  Offspring of Uther, early was ready;<br>  Feared not, failed not, fared on his journey<br>  Seeking for Cerdic.  Severn's waters<br>  Saw him and laughed, little expecting<br>  That Arthur the king and the excellent knights<br>  Of the Table Round, with troopers a-many,<br>  Would suffer the foemen to seize and possess the<br>  Lands of Siluria, would let the remorseless,<br>  Implacable, pitiless pagan and heathen<br>  Sail over Severn; not soon did it happen<br>  While Arthur the atheling his earth-joys tasted<br>  Here under heaven.  That hero was brave,<br>  Great, all-glorious: God fought for him:<br>  Nor Cerdic nor Cynric could soon injure that<br>  Hero of Heaven; his horrible destiny<br>  Wyrd the weaver wove in her eerie,<br>  Mysterious meshes, mighty, taciturn<br>  Goddess of gods: she gives whom she will to<br>  Speed in the battle.  Brave-mooded Arthur,<br>  Offspring of Uther, was eager for glory,<br>  Peerless of prowess: proudly, dauntlessly<br>  Fought he for Albion.  Not e'er heard I<br>  Of better battle-knight, more bold, fearless,<br>  That sun ever shone on: the sheen of his glory<br>  With lustre illumined the land where his mother<br>  Gave birth to the bairn; and broad, mighty,<br>  Spacious his fame was; his splendid achievements<br>  Were known to all nations.  None could e'er dare to<br>  Cope with that hero, till the conquering, dauntless<br>  Earl of the Anglians, ever-belovèd<br>  Founder of freedom and father of kings,<br>  O'er the seas sailing, slowly, bloodily<br>  Builded the best and broadest of kingdoms<br>  Heroes e'er heard of.  The heart of king Arthur<br>  Was sad as he saw the Saxon invader<br>  How, foot by foot, forward, onward,<br>  He ever proceeded, eastward, westward,<br>  Far to the north, founding and building<br>  A kingdom and country to crush and destroy the<br>  Land that he long had lived for, thought for,<br>  Fiercely had fought for.  Famed was Arthur,<br>  Wide his renown; but Wyrd the spinster<br>  Taketh no heed of hero or craven;<br>  Her warp and her woof she weaveth and spinneth<br>  Unmindful of men.  The mighty war-hero,<br>  Atheling Arthur, set out on his journey,<br>  Laid down his life-joys; the belovèd folk-lord's<br>  Feasting was finished.  Unflinching, fearless,<br>  Doomed unto death, dead on the battle-field<br>  Fell the brave folk-prince.  Foul was the traitor,<br>  Hated of heroes.  The hope of his countrymen<br>  Sank into darkness; for dead was Arthur,<br>  The last and the best and bravest of Albion's<br>  Athelings of eld.  Not ever thereafter<br>  Could the Welshman withstand the sturdy, mighty<br>  Tread of the Saxon as tramping, advancing,<br>  Onward he went, eastward, westward,<br>  Far to the northward: none withstood him,<br>  Now Arthur was lifeless; he alone was able<br>  To stay for a moment that sturdy, mighty,<br>  Invincible march.--The valiant, doughty<br>  Kinsmen of Cerdic, conquering earlmen,<br>  Forward then bare bravely, unfalt'ringly,<br>  Daringly, dauntlessly, the dragon of Wessex<br>  Fuming and flaming; fearlessly bare it<br>  Northward, eastward, on to the westward,<br>  O'er Severn and Thames and Trent and Humber<br>  And east oceanward, till all the great races<br>  Of Albion's isle owned as their liegelords<br>  The children of Cerdic, sire of kings and<br>  Founder of freedom.  Few among athelings<br>  Were greater than he, gift-lord eminent,<br>  Wielder of Wessex; the wise-mooded, far-seeing,<br>  Brave-hearted folk-prince builded his kingdom<br>  As a bulwark of freedom.  His brave, high-hearted<br>  Table-companions, trusty, faithful<br>  Liegemen and thanes, leaped to his service<br>  In peace and in war: well did they love him,<br>  Bowed to his bidding; blithely followed him<br>  Where the fight was fiercest; would fall in the battle<br>  Gladly, eagerly, excellent heroes,<br>  Ere they'd leave their dear lord alone on the battle-field,<br>  Bearing unaided the onset of foes and<br>  The brunt of the battle.  The brave ones were mindful<br>  Of the duties of liegemen; dastardly thought it<br>  To flee from the field while their fond, loving<br>  Leader and liegelord lingered thereon<br>  Dead or alive; deemed him a nidering<br>  Who stood not stoutly, sturdily, manfully<br>  Close to his lord as he led in the battle,<br>  Facing the foemen.  The free-hearted earlmen<br>  Minded the days when their dear-honored liegelord<br>  Feasted the throngs of thanemen-kinsmen<br>  In the handsomest of halls heroes e'er sat in<br>  'Neath dome of the welkin.  Well they remembered<br>  How their lord lovingly lavished his treasures<br>  On all earlmen older and younger,<br>  Greater and lesser: 't were loathsomest treason<br>  To leave such a lord alone in the battle,<br>  With a foe facing him.  The folk-ruler mighty<br>  King-like requited them with costliest gems,<br>  Most bountiful banqueting.  The brave-hearted man<br>  Builded his kingdom, broadly founded it<br>  Northward, eastward, on to the westward,<br>  South to the seaward.  He said tenderly,<br>  Cerdic discoursed, king of the Saxons,<br>  Father of England: "Old, hoary is<br>  Cerdic your king, kinsmen-thanemen,<br>  Warriors of Wessex.  Well have ye served me,<br>  Ye and your fathers.  I yet remember<br>  How, ere age came on me, I ever was foremost<br>  In deeds of daring, in doughty achievements,<br>  In feats of prowess.  I fought valiantly<br>  Alone, unaided, with only my faithful,<br>  Well-lovèd sword, and swept away hundreds<br>  Of earlmen of Albion: now age, ruthless,<br>  Horrible foe of heroes and warriors,<br>  Hath marred my might, though my mood is as daring,<br>  My spirit as stout and sturdy as ever<br>  In years of my youth.  I yearn in my soul, now,<br>  To cross over Severn and cut into slivers<br>  The wolf-hearted Welshmen.  Well-nigh a forty<br>  Years in their circuits have seen me a-conquering<br>  Here under heaven: from hence, early<br>  I go on my way.  Woden will bid me<br>  To the halls of Valhalla, where heroes will meet me,<br>  Gladly will seat me 'mid the glory-encircled<br>  Heroes of heaven.  In my heart it pains me<br>  To feel my war-strength fading and waning<br>  And ebbing away.  Would I might leap now<br>  Like a king to the battle, not cow-like breathe out my<br>  Soul in the straw.  The son of my bossom,<br>  Cynric my bairn, bravely will lead you<br>  When I am no more: he ever hath proved him<br>  A bold battle-earl.  My blade I will give him,<br>  Sigbrand my sword: he hath served me faithfully<br>  Sixty of winters: well do I love him,<br>  Bold-hearted battle-brand."  The brave earlmen, then,<br>  Shouted lustily, loudly commending<br>  The words of good Cerdic.  Cynric they loved, too,<br>  Son of the hero; themselves had beheld him<br>  How valiant, adventurous, invincible, king-like<br>  He ever had borne him, since erst he landed<br>  To fight, with his father, the fierce, implacable,<br>  Wolf-hearted Welshmen: well did they love him,<br>  And oft on the ale-benches earlmen asserted<br>  That, when good king Cerdic, gracious, belovèd<br>  Ward of the kingdom, went on his journey,<br>  Laid down his life-joys, his liegefolk would never<br>  Find them a folk-lord fonder, truer,<br>  More honored of all men, than atheling Cynric<br>  Surely would prove him.  Shouted they lustily,<br>  "Wes hael, wes hael! hero of Wessex,<br>  Cerdic the conqueror," clanging their lances<br>  And beating their bucklers, bellowed like oxen,<br>  Blew in their shields, shouting, yelling<br>  Glad-hearted, gleefully.  The good one discoursed, then,<br>  Cerdic the king said to his liegemen<br>  (Henchmen all hearkened): "Hear ye, good troopers,<br>  Of Sigbrand my sword.  I said he was trusty,<br>  And bitter in biting.  I brought him to Albion<br>  Far from the eastward.  I fared, long ago,<br>  East over Elbe and Oder and Weser<br>  And thence to the northward, never wearying,<br>  Greedy for glory; 'mid the Goths found it,<br>  Old, iron-made, excellent sword-blade,<br>  Weland his work.  Well I remember<br>  How I heard high-hearted heroes and athelings,<br>  My true-hearted troopers, tell how a dragon,<br>  His cave guarding, kept there a treasure<br>  Age after age; how earls of the eastward<br>  Said that Sigbrand, the sword-blade of Hermann,<br>  Was kept in that cave covered with magic,<br>  Encircled with sorcery, secretly guarded,<br>  Bound with enchantments.  I boldly adventured<br>  A grim grapple with that grisly, terrible<br>  Fire-spewing dragon, to fetch to the westward<br>  The well-lovèd, warlike, wide-famous brand<br>  Of Hermann the hero.  I hied o'er the rivers<br>  And off to the eastward: earls of those lands there<br>  Laughed when they learned that a lad from the westward<br>  Would dare the great dragon that had daunted their fathers<br>  Five hundred winters.  I fared eastward then,<br>  Met with the monster, mightily smote him,<br>  To earth felled him; flamings of battle<br>  Horribly hurled he, hotly he snorted,<br>  Would seethe me in poison.  Wtih the point of my blade<br>  I proudly did prick him.  Prone he fell forward,<br>  Dead lay the dragon.  His den was no more<br>  A horror to heroes; hastened I in, then,<br>  To joy in the sight of jewels and treasures<br>  And song-famous swords that had slept on the wall there<br>  From earliest eras, edge-keen, famous,<br>  Magic-encircled swords of the ancients,<br>  Old-work of giants.  With joy, saw I<br>  World-famous Sigbrand, sword-blade of Hermann,<br>  Men-leader mighty, matchless battle-knight,<br>  Hero of Germany.  I hastily seized it<br>  All rusting to ruin; the rime-carved, ancient<br>  Sword of the hero was soon hanging then<br>  Safe at my side: it hath served me faithfully<br>  Sixty of winters, well-tried, trusty<br>  Friend-in-the-battle.  When I fare, troopers,<br>  Hence to Valhalla, high-hearted Cynric,<br>  My fond-lovèd son, folk-lord of Wessex,<br>  Will take up the brand borne by his father<br>  And carve out a kingdom clean to the northward and<br>  Wide to the westward; the Welshman will cower<br>  And shudder and shake, as the shout of the Saxon<br>  Frightens afresh forest and river<br>  And meadow and plain.  I shall pass on my journey<br>  Early anon: old and hoary,<br>  Death will subdue me.  Dear young heroes,<br>  Do as I bid ye.  Bear ye onward<br>  The banner of Wessex.  Wyrd will help you<br>  If doughty your valor.  I dare to allege it,<br>  That the gods have given this goodly, bountiful<br>  Land of Albion to the liegemen and children<br>  Of Cerdic the Saxon; seize, hold to it<br>  Forever and ever.  Ye early will see me<br>  Lorn of my life-joys, lying unwarlike,<br>  Dead in my armor.  I urge you, good heroes,<br>  To build me a barrow broad-stretching, lofty,<br>  High on the cliff-edge, that comers from far<br>  May see it and say that so did Angle-folk<br>  Honor the atheling that erstwhile led their<br>  Fathers of old in founding a kingdom."<br>
