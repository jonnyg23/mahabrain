Tristram said,<br>  'And it grieves me full sore;<br>  Here win we back with a dozen dead<br>  And wounded a score, -<br>  And Mark is out a-hunting gone<br>  While I fight his war"<br>  I trow me well, by Godis head,<br>  It grieves me full sore!'<br>  <br>  And here came a lady's lad<br>  With golden curled hair,<br>  Desiring of Tristram,<br>  From Iseult, with courtesies,<br>  To learn how he fare.<br>  <br>  Then made he none else other word,<br>  But bade his squire to him,<br>  And did him off his great fell sword<br>  And his harness hacked and grim,<br>  And girt him with a chain of gold<br>  And his long cloak of green,<br>  And gat him as a gentle knight<br>  To greet that fair queen.<br>  <br>  All alone in her royal chamber<br>  Iseult watched for him,<br>  Where she screened candles made her<br>  A light soft and dim;<br>  They lit the beauty of her face<br>  And the glory of her hair:<br>  There was no maid in Christendom<br>  Half so wondrous fair.<br>  <br>  <i> 'Hail to thee, Tristram, back from thy warfare!<br>  Home again come again, hero, to me!<br>  Lone I have waited, fain for thy welfare,<br>  Longing and praying, dear one, for thee!'<br>  <br>  'Yea, I come again, O my belovèd,<br>  Back to Tintagel, home dear to thee.<br>  In the red warfare thy will for my welfare,<br>  Praying, has holpen and comforted me!'<br>  <br>  'Comest thou spent from the foemen who pressed thee?'<br>  'Yea, I am weary with travail of war!'<br>  'Ah, lay thy head on my bosom and rest thee.'<br>  'Dear, at thy touch, I am weary no more!'</i> <br>  <br>  He knelt before her knightly-wise<br>  And kissed her finger-tips;<br>  She kissed him once on either cheek<br>  And twice upon the lips.<br>  'And now,' quoth he, 'is dole on me,<br>  That I may not abide with thee:<br>  Iseult, mine own, I pray thee then,<br>  Think me not graceless if I go,<br>  For much is now for me to do<br>  When home again come we;<br>  And I wis my gallant gentlemen<br>  Are calling for me!'<br>  <br>  'Nay till this candle burn away,'<br>  She said, 'O tarry thou, -<br>  And that will be, as well we see,<br>  Short while enough from now!'<br>  And Tristram, watching near her, smiled<br>  As one on whom old memories fall,<br>  Saying, 'Iseult, art still a child<br>  In spite of all, in spite of all!'<br>  And low he sat him at her feet<br>  And took in his the hand she gave,<br>  And felt her presence, rare and sweet,<br>  As ever sway him, till it drave<br>  From sense and limb the weariness<br>  Of battle and the road, and lent<br>  Its lulling magic to caress<br>  His soul with some divine content.<br>  <br>  The pine-log smouldering on the hearth<br>  Shone through the shaded gloom;<br>  The flowers on her table thrilled<br>  With drowsy, faint perfume.<br>  They talked of battle and the chase,<br>  They spake of life and love,<br>  So that they saw no shadow<br>  Across the dim wall more,<br>  Neither behind them wist they<br>  From the corner curtain-screened<br>  King Mark out of the darkness<br>  Creep with face of fiend!<br>  <br>  'Tristram! - ah no -!'  A gleam like silver swung<br>  Downward and struck.  And frozen on her tongue<br>  The low cry died that warned him of his fate,<br>  Ah God, too late, too late!<br>  Too late she saw the shadowed image fall<br>  Of a man's huge armed hand upon the wall,<br>  And felt the presence clutch her heart, of one<br>  Like doom behind them, silent, knowing all.<br>  Dear Christ!  too late she heard<br>  That sudden gasp of sharply loosened breath<br>  As sheer the great blade fell.<br>  And Mark stood forth with face of flaming hell,<br>  And they two looked on death<br>  And spake no word.<br>   <br>
