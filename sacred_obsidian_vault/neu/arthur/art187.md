Minister no more,<br> Ye ever-hovering spirits! 'tis in vain,<br> To sooth this storm-toss'd bosom.  Earth and Air,<br> And the deep-bosom'd waters, to this wand,<br> Indeed, pay homage; and the elfin train<br> That round the harp of Braga, echoing, throng<br> (Swelling his magic numbers) on my steps<br> Wait warbling; and with minstrelsey and voice,<br> Obedient to my wishes, fill the air<br> With choral melodies.  My wiley arts<br> Have thrall'd the soul of Vortigern; in whom<br> Britain, my foe, lies prostrate; and the gods<br> Of Scandinavia in my witching smiles<br> Build their ensanguin'd altars.  Cambria's sons,<br> And all the Brutean race, already feel<br> The woman victor.  Even the nether world,<br> Seasons, and circling Elements obey<br> My potent biddings.  Cloud-compelling Thor<br> Must wield his thundering Gauntlet, or controul,<br> With lifted Mace, the Giants of the Frost<br> If I but chaunt The Rhyme.  Yet what avails?<br> Arthur disdains my charms; and o'er his heart,<br> My spells are powerless.  Yet once more I'll try.<br> Once more the secret dwellings of The Fates<br> This ken shall pierce.  These feet again shall thrid<br> The abodes of Hela.  Rife, ye ministering maids,<br> Shake from your slothful lids the charmed sleep,<br> And do your wakeful service.    [<i> They come forward</i> .<br>                           Edelthred!<br> Hast thou heard aught of strange or terrible<br> Marring thy midnight slumber?<br>                  <i> Edelthred</i> .  Nothing, Madam.<br> My sleep was sweet and tranquil.<br>             <i> Row</i> .  Well--and yours?<br> <i> Agga</i> .     Full of sweet visions--gentle and serene.<br> <i> Row</i> .     'Twas as I wish'd.  Oh! impotence of power!<br> Terrestrial, or supernal!  To each eye--<br> All but mine own--to every wearied sense<br> Or Mara from some brief imperfect dream<br> Wakes me, delirious, on her phantom'd forms<br> To gaze with poweless horror.  'Tis too much.<br> Hell, give me more: or take the power ye gave.<br> Give me to triumph o'er my Arthur's heart,<br> And in these arms enfold him! or my spells,<br> Hence I forswear, this gifted wand I break, <br> Nor at the altars of Asgardian Gods<br> Chaunt hence the Runic rhyme.<br>                              Haste Edelthred;<br> Bring here my mystic robes: the same that erst<br> (While the dire Sisters join'd the fearful chaunt)<br> I wove in Cimbrian groves.<br> <br>              Air <i> by an invisible Spirit</i> .<br> <br>           Magic Woof, in Cimbrian shade<br>           Woven by the gifted maid,<br>           While the Raven-voice of Fate<br>           Croak'd of slaughters, fears, and hate,<br> <i> Sem cho</i> .

There 'twas wove--a webb of fear!<br> <i> Row</i> .      Its die it drank from infant gore,<br>            And tears of mothers blotch it o'er;<br>            It is a mystic webb of fear.<br>            Haste my virgins:  bring it here.<br> <br> <i>    Ed</i> .  Hertha defend!  What means our troubled Queen?<br>    <i> Row</i> .  Again, in that terrific pall, to thrid<br> The maze of Hela; and with potent rhyme,<br> Extort a boon from Fate.  Can I controul<br> The tempest-heaving Nocca? at my will<br> Brandish the Thunderer's gauntlet? rend the air<br> With bidden storms? and from the shades of night<br> Evoke the wandering spirit? yet not quench,<br> With its desir'd fruition, the fierce flame<br> That preys upon my vitals?  Does the power<br> Of magic numbers not extend to Love?<br> Or are our gods fastidious, to deny<br> An unbelieving paramour?--save such<br> Whom Weakness to uxorious faith may bow:<br> Pageants! and Vortigerns!   My Pall!  My Pall!<br>    By that dread Fiend Unutterable! whose frown<br> Makes Nature sterrile, I will know my doom.<br> The Fatal Sisters, who, in Hela's shade,<br> Weave the dark woof, shall tell me all they know,<br> And with their magic aid me.     Yet--forbear!<br> Earth and the shuddering elements confess<br> The approach of feet profane.<br>                       <i> Edel</i> .  The bugle (hark!)<br> Wakening the echoes, thro the distant courts<br> Sounds in the hurried blast.<br>                     <i> Row</i> .  Some voice, assured,<br>    Of evil omen seeks my wounded ear,<br> Big with a tale of horrors.  Let it come.<br> What worse can greet Rowenna than the news<br> That Arthur scorns her passion?<br> <br>                     <i> Enter</i>  Alwin.<br>                           Well: how now?<br> Thy dark portentous brow and hurried eye<br> Outstrip thy tongue's intelligence, and make<br> Thy silence eloquent.  Thou hast some tale<br> Of horrors and disasters.  Give it breath.<br> I have a heart prepar'd for all the worst:<br> A soul that shall not falter.  I forgive<br> Thy evil tidings, tho they should import<br> My father's death, the Saxon overthrow,<br> And Cambria's triumph.<br>                 <i> Alwin</i> .  Prophetess inspired!<br> Thy words prevent my message.  Such my news.<br> Hengist, indeed, is fallen:  The Saxon power<br> Crouches to Britain.  To the conflict led<br> By fierce Ambrosius, with Armoric aids,<br> Sudden they burst upon us, near the towers<br> Of Connisburg.  Arthur's enchanted sword<br> Gleam'd like a pestilence; and thro' our ranks<br> Scatter'd dismay and death.  His dragon crest<br> Belch'd streams of living fire; and on his breath<br> The dread Valkyries hung; where'er he bad,<br> Singling their victims.<br>                   <i> Row</i> .  Arthur?  Arthur?<br>                                    <i> Alw</i> .  He--<br> Pendragon's fiercer son.  In horrid grace,<br> Wrathful he strode the field.  His glittering mail<br> And youthful limbs, besmear'd with Saxon blood,<br> Daz'd every sense.  With awful wonder fill'd,<br> Our hearts were palsy'd: as tho Woden's self,<br> Fresh from Iduna's banquet, came renew'd,<br> To ply the work of Fate, and his own race<br> Whelm in one general wreck.  Meantime the king,<br> Your royal father--<br>                <i> Row</i> .  Met his arm; and died?--<br> By Arthur died?<br>         <i> Alw</i> .  Not so--that fatal deed<br> Ambrosius boasts--who, hoary in his hate,<br> And full of guile, engorg'd with treacherous wound<br> The elfe-engaged Hengist: and he fell--<br> Fell by the Briton!--while our scatter'd ranks<br> Fled o'er the plain for safety--vainly sought.<br>    <i> Row</i> .  Frea!  I thank thee.  Genial Goddess! hail!<br> Hail the propitious omen!  'Twas thy care<br> That Hengist's blood stained not the hand of Arthur.<br>    Pursue thy tale.  Some other hour, more fit,<br> We will select for tears.  Occasions press;<br> And we must find prompt councils.  Whether fled<br> The abject Vortigern?<br>                    <i> Alw</i> .  From bourg to bourg<br> (By all alike rejected) with his suit,<br> Westward he fled, towards his Cambrian wilds,<br> A hunted fugitive: till join'd, at last,<br> By those who 'scap'd the slaughter, he attain'd<br> The heights of bleak Farinioch.  There he lurks,<br> Hem'd by Gwrtheyrnion's towers, whose giant strength<br> Frowns o'er the midway steep.  Thither he bore<br> (From his incestuos passion unestrang'd)<br> His fair, reluctant daughter, Guenever.<br>   <i> Row</i> .  She scap'd not then into the arms of Arthur?<br> She is secure.  Revenge at least is sure:<br> And Love has hope!  Say, hast thou aught beside<br> That may import my hearing?<br>                    <i> Alw.</i>   Sovereign! nought:<br> But that the exulting victor, to destroy<br> The Saxon hope, has purpose to depose<br> Our pageant Vortigern; and, in his place,<br> Crown the new idol, Arthur.<br>               <i> Row</i> . (<i> aside</i> ) Arthur crown'd?<br> And so he shall be.  But not crown'd by them.<br> That is Rowenna's Dower: the dower confirm'd<br> By the three Fatal Sisters.--While I live,<br> Thy empire, Albion, waits my spousal love:<br> And Arthur, if he reigns, must reign by me.<br> Alwin, what else?<br>           <i> Alw</i> .  Your royal will.  Beside<br> Nought now remains untold.<br>               <i> Row</i> .  Then, Alwin, thus--<br> Haste to Gwrtheyrnion with what scatter'd powers<br> Your speed may gather.  See the gates secur'd<br> Against my soon arrival.  I shall bring <br> Such powerful succours as may best defend<br> The alpine fortress, should the victors dare<br> To press us to a siege.  Away.  Begone.   [<i> Exit Alw</i> .<br>    O Edelthred!  O Agga! why should thus<br> My heart beat lighter, and the breath more free<br> Distend my sportive bosom?  Hengist slain--<br> The Saxon routed!--Here is the cause of grief<br> For Nature and Ambition.  But my soul<br> Is full of Love and Arthur.  Frea smiles<br> To my best hopes propitious; and, amidst<br> The storms of adverse destiny, my heart<br> Finds anchor in her aid.<br> <br>           Goddess of the genial hour!<br>             Hear, O! hear my votive sigh;<br>           And, tho' adverse Fortune lour,<br>             Fear and Sorrow I defy,<br>                Goddess of the genial hour!<br>           Grief may drop the transient tear,<br>             Wild Ambition heave the breast;<br>           But, if thou in smiles appear,<br>             All is tranquil--all is blest,<br>                Goddess of the genial hour!<br>           Fear and Sorrow I defy,<br>             Tho my adverse fortune lour,<br>           Hear but thou my votive sigh,<br>             Goddess of the genial hour!<br> <br>   <i> Edel</i> .  And she will hear it--if we aught may judge<br> The future by the present.  Could we hope<br> A fairer pledge of promise?  Arthur's hand<br> Slew not your father.--Arthur's conquering aid<br> Could not redeem his Guenever.<br>                        <i> Row</i> .  'Tis there<br> My fondest hopes are fix'd--Still, still she pines<br> In hostile bonds--still hears with steadfast hate<br> (Would it were not so steadfast!) the foul suit<br> Of that incestuous Vortigern: or writhes,<br> Perchance, subjected to his foul embrace,<br> Calling, in vain, on Arthur.  I will aid<br> The lawless passion of this monster king,<br> Goading his vile desires, and urging on<br> To their impell'd fruition.  Haply so<br> (For man, with sickly appetite, abhors<br> Oft from the trick of Fancy) Arthur hence<br> Shall loath her rifled beauties:  She no more<br> Shall seem or chaste or lovely; and his eyes<br> Confess superiour merit.  Then shall soon<br> Adultrous Vortigern my vengeance feel;<br> And his polluted paramour:  This hand<br> Shall lift my Arthur to an envied throne,<br> And our united sceptres blend the tribes<br> Of Cimbria and of Britain.     Say I well?<br>   <i> Agga</i> .  Well: if The Fates ordain.<br>                             <i> Row</i> .  We will enquire.<br> And for such purpose in The Secret Grove<br> Chant we the spell.  My double-visag'd Fate<br> (Ghastly at once and jocund) goads me on<br> Amidst a storm of passions.  To The Grove<br> Initiate Virgins, and the haunted cave;<br> There join the fearful chaunt.  And ye, unseen--<br> Ye shapeless spirits of the impassive air,<br> Lend me your minstrelsey.  Yet first evoke<br> The oafish Incubus.  While yet the bat,<br> Beneath the ominous mantle of the night,<br> Follows the beetles hum, be it his talk<br> To scout the country round; if chance he learn<br> Tidings of Arthur; who, at once impell'd<br> By love and by ambition, will pursue<br> The steps of Guenever.  Him should he find,<br> Upon the attendant train let him essay<br> His numbing tricks: that while they, shivering, sink<br> In senseless torpor, Arthur, all alone<br> These eyes once more may meet.  Evoke the fiend.<br> What further I design the mystic grove<br> And secret cave shall witness.  Join me there<br> Where, in my Cimbrian pall and snaky tire,<br> I chaunt the spell to Hertha.<br> <br> <br>       Howl of wolves, and ghosts of night,<br>         In the fearful chorus join,<br>       While The Moon withdraws his light,<br>       And the stars, in dim afright,<br>         Veil their orbs, and fear to shine.<br>       Hark!--they wait to swell the rite--<br>       Howl of wolves and ghosts of night!<br>                      [<i> Exeunt</i>  Row.  Edel.  &amp;c.<br> <br> <br> <br>           Scene II.         <i> Manet</i>  Agga.<br> <i> Agga</i> .  Incubus!  Incubus!<br>     <i> Incubus, (below.)  </i> Whu-u-u!  Whe-e-ether now?<br>   Who-o-o calls so loud?<br>                 <i> Agga</i> .  You know, I trow.<br> Incubus!  Incubus!<br>   Did you not your mistress hear?<br> <i> Incub</i> .  Ye-e-e-e-yes--<br>  Behold your shivering devil here.<br> <br>    <i> The ground uncloses, and thro the chasm rises a meagre spectre, with a blue and frosty <br> countenance, sunken eyes, frozen locks and beard, and garments covered with icicles.<br> </i> <br> <i>    Incub</i> . (<i> Shaking the snow from his sides.</i> )  Whu-u-u-u!<br>            What's the business pr'ythee now?<br>    <i> Agga</i> .   Son of Frost! you know I trow.<br>            Did you not your Mistress hear?<br> <i>    Incub</i> .  Hear?  O yes; there's no fear of that, I<br> assure you.  When 'tis a woman we serve, our orders<br> are sure to be sufficiently audible!  The frosts of Hela<br> cannot plug up one's ears against the <i> clear</i>  tones of<br> the feminine organ.  But pr'ythee now, leave off your<br> rhyming and your incantations, and blow my fingers<br> for me a little.--It is half a century since I have<br> been able to breathe any thing but sleet and hailstones<br> upon them myself.<br>    <i> Agga</i> .  Really I have no warm breath to spare upon so<br> cold a subject.<br>    <i> Incub</i> .  Why I suppose, indeed, I am not very engaging.<br>   Some thousand years hence, when ice-creams are <br> predestined to become an article of luxury,<br> some lady of honour, may chance to take a liking to a joint or <br> two, by way of stomachic:  But at present, I believe,<br> there is no great danger of my being devour'd by<br> the fair sex.<br>    <i> Agga</i> .  Not if they are of my taste, at least.<br>    <i> Incub</i> .  But pray, good Mrs. Journeywoman Sorceress! <br> have you any further instructions?  Any snug little <br> commission for yourself?<br>    <i> Agga</i> .  Good Mr. Journeyman Devil! no.--If ever<br> I admit any of your infernal train into my service, it<br> shall be a devil of better quality.<br>    <i> Incub</i> .  Aye! aye!  Mrs. you are for a good plump<br> roasting devil I suppose.  This essence of snow and<br> icicles might melt before the blaze of your beauty.<br>    <i> Agga.</i>   What, you think I have some attractions then?<br>    <i> Incub</i> .  Attractions!  Before I descended into the<br>  regions of Hela, to have my blood converted into icicles,<br> I should have been ready to die for you any half hour<br> of my existience.<br>    <i> Ag</i> .  Were you such a Dragon amongst us in your<br> life time?--Come, come; I suspect it was not for this<br> you were sent to The Frozen Regions<br>    <i> Inc</i> .  Why, no: offences of that sort are punished<br>  in a Hell of a very different description.  In short, there<br>  is no dissembling.  You know the mysteries of our <br> faith; and the thing speaks for itself.  Our fisticuff<br>  Divinities and I happened not to set up our horses<br> together on the subject of the exquisite delight of being<br>  hacked and hewed into a thousand pieces.  Not <br> but that I could be valiant enough in my own way:<br> for my mouth was full of big oaths; and my brow<br> seemed as dark with danger as a thunder-cloud: till a<br> disastrous coincidence took the sword of my renown<br> out of my mouth, and placed it in my hand.<br>    <i> Ag</i> .  Ha! ha! poor Incubus!  And then I suppose <br> it was perfectly out of its element.<br>    <i> Inc</i> .

[<i> Exit</i> .<br> <br> <br> <i> SCENE III</i> .  <i> Enter </i> Tristram, <i> armed with sword and<br>    Target; The </i> Seneschal, <i> and a </i> Sewer.<br> <br>   <i> Trist</i> .  And so we are to have feasting before fighting?<br> master Seneschal!<br>   <i> Seneschal</i> .  Aye--and good reasons there be, master<br> Newcomer.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  Aye--I hope the Raisins are good, master<br> Seneschal, or they will make an ill part of the desert.<br> But, for reasons less eatable, which be they?<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  They be three in number, master Newcomer.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  Hem!--Three!--But three is a favourite<br> number, I believe, among you Scandinavians.<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  True, master Newcomer--and for good reason.<br> It is mystical and sacred.  For example--there be three<br> sons of Beör (Woden, Vile, and Ve) who knock'd the<br> giant Ymer o' the head, created the world out of his<br> carcase, and set his brains a flying thro the air for clouds.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  Hum!--A hum!  I can smell it.  (<i> Aside</i> .)--<br> A pretty piece of flesh, at this rate, your Ymer must <br> have been, master Seneschal.--And yet, upon second <br> thoughts, he was but a moody, muddy, addle-headed<br> sort of a giant, either; or his brains could not have <br> been converted to such a use.<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  Then there be three Fatal Sisters.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  Aye--three Witches, as one might say, master<br> Seneschal! the eldest of which, by the way, is no<br> Witch, i'my way of thinking; for she only fortells<br> what is past: carrying her eyes behind her, as it were.<br> Strait forward she cannot see so far as her nose.  And,<br> as for the second, (by your account of her) she has no<br> more foresight than a hare: and yet, she seems more in-<br> debted to her eyes than her understanding for her repu-<br> tation in the world.  Her glances go, bolt shot, in all di-<br> rections, thro all impediments of space and matter: like<br> a lance thro a battered buckler.  She can see all the ble-<br> mishes that a maid hides with her mantle, or a batchelor<br> under his gabardine, as plain as a carbuncle on a nose<br> of four inches; but as for how long the batchelor shall re-<br> main a batchelor, or the maid a maid, master Seneschal!--<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  Why for that, master Newcomer, she refers you<br> to her younger sister.  And this, by the way, brings me,<br> pat, to three other Sisters, of a very different description,<br> (not but they, also, have something to do with our des-<br> tinies, master Newcomer!) I mean the three smirking <br> damsels, that wait on The Propitious Goddess, to whom<br> the aforesaid maids and batchelors offer up their vows,<br> when they wish to be maids and batchelors no longer.<br>   And then there be three Giants of Frost; three War-<br> hounds, that guard the Gates of Hela; and three Valky-<br> ries, that wait on the banquet of Woden, in Valhalla.<br>   <i> Sewer</i> .  Very true, master Seneschal: but what has<br> all this to do with the reasons for our banquet?<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  Why much, master Sewer:--much.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  Aye, very much, master Sewer: for a Ban-<br> quet is a Banquet, whether in Valhalla or Gwrtheyrnion:<br> Is it not? master Seneschal!  There's affinity, for you,<br> imprimus.  Then, in the second place--for we can find<br> three affinities, or similitudes, in this case, also--Can we<br> not? master Seneschal!--In the second place, a full sto-<br> mach is better than an empty one, in Gwrtheyrnion as well<br> as in Valhalla--Is it not, master Seneschal?  There's af-<br> finity for you, again, or the devil's in it.  And then, in<br> the third place, (which brings us to our point;) there are<br> three reasons for the banquet, in one place, as well as the <br> other--videlicit--there be victuals to eat--there be people<br> to eat them--and there is a place in which they may be <br> eaten.  Which, also, may in three diverse ways be <br> stated--to wit, Imprimus, The passivity, or the victuals<br> eatable--the locality, or the place of eating--and the<br> agency, or the persons to eat.  Secundo, The prompti-<br> tude, or or desire of eating--the aptitude, or convenience<br> of a place to eat in--and the plentitude, or abundance<br> of things eatable.  Tertio, Yearning of the bowels, or<br> the hungering after--temptation to the eye, or the pre-<br> sence of the things whereafter we hunger--and ministra-<br> tion copulative; or the tables and benches, in the great<br> hall; whereby the parties are enabled to approximate, the<br> come-at-ability of the desired is facilitated, and the desirers<br> are fundamentally accommodated.<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  Right! right! master Newcomer!  Truly, for <br> all thou beest a Welchman, and I a Saxon, I desire thy<br> further acquaintance; for thou seemest learned in these<br> matters, and of an excellent wit.<br>   <i> Sew</i> .  Why now, by your leave, master Seneschal, all<br> these be good reasons for banqueting at all times--but<br> they be no reasons for banqueting before battle.<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  Short--short, master Sewer.  If they be good<br> reasons for banqueting at all times, then be they good<br> reasons for banqueting before, as well as after.<br>   <i> Sew</i> .  Aye; but the specific, master Seneschal! the<br> specific.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  Why the specifics be three, also, master Sewer.<br> Imprimus--there is fish to be eaten; and they are best<br> to be eaten fresh--Secundo, fighting is hard work; and <br> good eating and drinking minister to strength--Tertio, it<br> is thought best to eat first, lest a part of the guests should<br> get their bellies so full of fighting, as to have no appetite<br> left for any thing else.<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  And, if these tripple reasons satisfy not the tender<br> conscience, there is yet behind, a reason omnipotent,<br> which is one and indivisible, namely, that The Fates<br> would have it so.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  The Fates!  How so? master Seneschal.<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  Why, to tell you a secret--our mistress has been<br> making a journey into hell.<br>   <i> Trist</i> . (<i> aside</i> .) Aye, aye, to bespeak apartments I sup-<br> pose.--Hum!<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  And, as she reports it, The Fatal Sisters or-<br> dered this banquet.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  Did they so?  Faith I shall have a better opi-<br> nion of them, for the future, than I used to have.<br>   <i> Sew</i> .  Aye, and so shall I.  Od zookers!  I cared not<br> if our Mistress went to hell every day, at this rate.<br>   <i> Sen</i> .  It is necessary, it seems, that the reconciliation be-<br> tween her and the King should be thus celebrated; and <br> that, in token of their re-union, she should present him<br> with a Cup of her own mixing; as she did at their first <br> meeting; and then all is to go well.<br>   <i> Sew</i> .  Good! master Seneschal.  And yet our priests<br> will have it that it is not orthodox: because, in Valhalla,<br> Woden and his Monoheroes always fight first, and ban-<br> quet afterwards.<br>   <i> Trist</i> .  Aye, aye!--they want one half of us to get<br> a quietus before the banquet, that there may be a double<br> share of the baked and boiled for them.  But as for<br> those Monoheroes, I have a song about them: and, if the<br> harpers and trumpeters will bear me out with an accom-<br> paniment, I care not if I sing it to you.<br> <br> O! your joys of Valhalla to me they are all mere<br>       Greek, Sirs,<br> Where you fight till you are kill'd--<br>  [Kill'd?--well: and what of that?  If it were but once,<br>    and away, one would not mind it--(&amp;c. &amp;c. <i> ad<br>    libitum</i> .)
