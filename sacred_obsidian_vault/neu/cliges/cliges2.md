 <br>
 
 (Vv. 2279-2310.)  "Alexander," says the Queen, "any love is worse
 than hate, when it torments and distresses its devotee.  Lovers
 know not what they do when they conceal their passion from one
 another.  Love is a serious business, and whoever does not boldly
 lay its foundation firm can hardly succeed in completing the
 edifice.  They say there is nothing so hard to cross as the
 threshold.  Now I wish to instruct you in the lore of love; for I
 know well that Love is tormenting you.  Therefore, I have
 undertaken to instruct you; and do you take good care not to keep
 anything back from me, for I have plainly seen in the faces of
 you both that of two hearts you have made but one.  So beware,
 and conceal nothing from me!  You are acting very foolishly in
 not speaking out your mind; for concealment will be the death of
 you; thus you will be the murderers of Love.  Now I counsel you
 to exercise no tyranny, and to seek no passing gratification in
 your love; but to be honourably joined together in marriage.  So,
 I believe, your love shall long endure.  I can assure you that,
 if you agree to this, I will arrange the marriage."
 <p>
 (Vv. 2311-2360.)  When the Queen had spoken her mind, Alexander
 thus made reply: "Lady," he says, "I enter no defence against the
 charge you make, but rather admit the truth of all you say.  I
 wish never to be deserted by love, but always to fix my thoughts
 on it.  I am pleased and delighted by what you have so kindly
 said.  Since you know what my wishes are, I see no reason why I
 should conceal them from you.  Long ago, if I had dared I would
 have confessed them openly; for the silence has been hard.  But
 it may well be that for some reason this maiden may not wish that
 I be hers and she mine.  But even if she grant me no rights over
 her, yet will I place myself in her hands."  At these words she
 trembled, having no desire to refuse the gift.  Her heart's
 desire betrays itself in her words and her countenance.
 Falteringly she gives herself to him, and says that without
 exception her will, her heart, and her body all is at the
 disposal of the Queen, to do with her as she may please.  The
 Queen clasps them both in her arms, and presents one to the
 other.  Then laughingly she adds: "I give over to thee,
 Alexander, thy sweetheart's body, and I know that thy heart does
 not draw back.  Whoever may like it or like it not, I give each
 of you to the other.  Do thou, Soredamors, take what is thine,
 and thou, Alexander, take what is thine!"  Now she has her own
 entire, and he has his without lack.  At Windsor that day, with
 the approval and permission of my lord Gawain and the King, the
 marriage was celebrated.  No one could tell, I am sure, so much
 of the magnificence and the food, of the pleasure and
 entertainment, at this wedding without falling short of the
 truth.  Inasmuch as it would be distasteful to some, I do not
 care to waste further words upon the matter, but am anxious to
 turn to another subject.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2361-2382.)  That day at Windsor Alexander had all the
 honour and happiness that he could desire.  Three different joys
 and honours were his: one was the town which he captured; another
 was the present of the best kingdom in Wales, which King Arthur
 had promised to give him when the war was over; that very day he
 made him king in his hall.  But the greatest joy of all was the
 third -- that his sweetheart was queen of the chess-board where
 he was king.  Before five months had passed, Soredamors found
 herself with child, and carried it until the time was fulfilled.
 The seed remained in germ until the fruit was fully matured.  No
 more beautiful child was ever born before or since than he whom
 they now called Cliges.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2383-2456.)  So Cliges was born, in whose honour this story
 has been put in the Romance tongue.  You shall hear me tell of
 him and of his valorous deeds, when he shall have grown to
 manhood and obtained a good report.  But meanwhile in Greece it
 came about that he who ruled over Constantinople drew near his
 end.  He died, as indeed he must, not being able to outlive his
 time.  But before he died he assembled all the nobles of his land
 to send and seek for his son Alexander, who was happily detained
 in Britain.  The messengers start out from Greece, and begin
 their voyage over the seas; but a tempest catches them in its
 grasp, and damages their ship and company.  They were all drowned
 at sea, except one unfaithful wretch, who was more devoted to
 Alis the younger son than to Alexander the eider.  When he
 escaped from the sea, he returned to Greece with the story that
 they had all been lost at sea as they were conducting their lord
 back from Britain, and that he was the only survivor of the
 tragedy.  They believed this lie of his, and, taking Alis without
 objection or dissent, they crowned him emperor of Greece.  But it
 was not long before Alexander learned that Alis was emperor. 
 Then he took leave of King Arthur, unwilling to let his brother
 usurp his land without protest.  The King makes no opposition to
 his plan, but bids him take with him so great a company of
 Welshmen, Scots, and Cornishmen that his brother will not dare to
 withstand him when he sees him come with such a host.  Alexander,
 had he pleased, might have led a mighty force; but he has no
 desire to harm his own people, if his brother will consent to do
 his will.  He took with him forty knights besides Soredamors and
 his son; these two persons, who were so dear to him, he did not
 wish to leave behind.  Escorted as far as Shoreham by the entire
 court, they there embarked, and with fair winds their ship made
 way more quickly than a fleeing stag.  Within a month, I think,
 they arrived in port before Athens, a rich and powerful city.
 Indeed, the emperor was residing there, and had convoked, a great
 assembly of his noblemen.  As soon as they arrived Alexander sent
 a privy messenger into the city to learn whether they would
 receive him, or whether they would resist his claim to be their
 only lawful lord.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2457-2494.)  He who was chosen for this mission was a
 courteous knight with good judgment, named Acorionde, a rich man
 and eloquent; he was a native of the country, too, having been
 born in Athens.  His ancestors for generations had always
 exercised lordship in the city.  When he had learned that the
 emperor was in the city he went and challenged the crown on
 behalf of his brother Alexander, accusing him openly of having
 usurped it unlawfully.  Arriving at the palace, he finds plenty
 of people who welcome him; but he says nothing to any of those
 who greet him until he learns what is their attitude and
 disposition toward their lawful lord.  Coming into the presence
 of the emperor he neither greets him nor bows before him nor
 calls him emperor.  "Alis," he says, "I bring thee tidings of
 Alexander, who is out yonder in the harbour.  Listen to thy
 brother's message: he asks thee for what belongs to him, nor does
 he demand what is unjust.  Constantinople, which thou dost hold,
 should be his and shall be his.  It would be neither just nor
 right that discord should arise between you two.  So give him the
 crown without contest, for it is right that thou shouldst
 surrender it."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2495-2524.)  Alis replies: "Fair gentle friend, thou hast
 undertaken a mad enterprise in bearing this message.  There is
 little comfort in thy speech, for well I know that my brother is
 dead.  I should rejoice, indeed, to learn that he was still
 alive.  But I shall not believe the news until I have seen him
 with my eyes.  He died some time ago, alas!  What thou sayest is
 not credible.  And if he lives, why does he not come?  He need
 never fear that I will not bestow on him some lands.  He is a
 fool to hold aloof from me, for in serving me he will find
 profit.  But no one shall possess the crown and empire beside
 me."  He liked not the speech of the emperor, and did not fail to
 speak his mind in the reply he made.  "Alis," he says, "may God
 confound me if the matter is thus allowed to stand.  I defy thee
 in thy brother's name, and dutifully speaking in his name, I
 summon all those whom I see here to renounce thee and to join his
 cause.  It is right that they should side with him and recognise
 him as their lord.  Let him who is loyal now stand forth."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2525-2554.)  Upon saying this he leaves the court, and the
 emperor summons those in whom he has most confidence.  He
 requests their advice concerning this defiance upon his brother's
 part, and wishes to learn if he can trust them to lend no support
 or help to his brother's claim.  Thus he tries to test the
 loyalty of each; but he finds not one who sides with him in the
 dispute, rather do they all bid him remember the war which
 Eteocles undertook against his own brother Polynices, and how
 each one died by the other's hand. (23)  "So, too, it may happen
 to you, if you undertake a war, and all the land will be
 distressed."  Therefore, they advise that such a peace be sought
 as shall be both reasonable and just, and that neither one make
 excessive demands.  Thus Alis understands that if he does not
 make an equitable agreement with his brother all his vassals will
 desert him; so he says that he will respect their wishes in
 making any suitable contract, provided that however the affair
 may rum out the crown shall remain in his possession.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2555-2618.)  In order to secure a firm and stable peace Alis
 sends one of his officers to Alexander, bidding him come to him
 in person and receive the government of the land, but stipulating
 that he should leave to him the honour of emperor in name and of
 wearing the crown: thus, if Alexander is willing, peace may be
 established between them.  When this news was brought to
 Alexander his men made ready with him and came to Athens, where
 they were received with joy.  But Alexander is not willing that
 his brother should have the sovereignty of the empire and of the
 crown unless he will pledge his word never to take a wife, and
 that after him Cliges shall be emperor of Constantinople.  Upon
 this the brothers both agreed.  Alexander dictated the terms of
 the oath, and his brother agreed and gave his word that he would
 never in his life take a wife in marriage.  So peace is made, and
 they are friends again, to the great satisfaction of the lords.
 They hold Alis as their emperor, but all business is referred to
 Alexander.  What he commands is done, and little is done except
 through him.  Alis has nothing but the name of emperor; but
 Alexander is served and loved; and he who does not serve him for
 love must needs do so from fear.  Through the effect of one or
 the other of these two motives he has all the land within his
 power. But he whom they call Death spares neither the strong man
 nor the weak, but kills and slays them all.  So Alexander had to
 die; for a disease caught him in its grip from which he could
 obtain no relief.  But before he was surprised by death he
 summoned his son and said to him: "Fair son Cliges, thou canst
 never know that prowess and valour are thine unless thou go first
 to make test of them with the Bretons and French at King Arthur's
 court.  If adventure takes thee thither, so conduct and demean
 thyself that thy identity be not known until thou hast tried thy
 strength with the most excellent knights of that court.  I beg
 thee to heed my counsel in this matter, and if the occasion
 arises have no fear to measure thy skill with thy uncle, my lord
 Gawain.  Do not forget this advice, I pray."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2619-2665.)  After he had thus exhorted him, he did not live
 long.  Soredamors' grief was such that she could not survive him,
 but died after him of a broken heart.  Alis and Cliges both
 mourned him becomingly, but finally they ceased their grief, for
 sorrow, like everything else, must be outlived.  To continue in
 sorrow is wrong, for no good can come from it.  So the mourning
 was ended, and the emperor refrained for a long time from taking
 a wife, being careful of his word.  But there is no court in all
 the world which is free from evil counsel.  Great men often go
 astray, and do not observe loyalty because of the bad advice they
 take.  Thus, the emperor hears his men giving him advice and
 counselling him to take a wife; and daily they so exhort and urge
 him that by their very insistence they persuade him to break his
 oath, and to accede to their desire.  But he insists that she who
 is to be mistress of Constantinople must be gentle, fair, wise,
 rich, and noble.  Then his counsellors say that they wish to
 prepare to go away to the German land, and seek the daughter of
 the emperor.  She is the choice they propose to him; for the
 emperor of Germany is very rich and powerful, and his daughter is
 so charming that never was there a maid of her beauty in
 Christendom.  The emperor grants them full authority, and they
 set out upon the journey well provided with all they need.  They
 proceeded on their way until they found the emperor at
 Regensburg, when they asked him to give them his oldest daughter
 at the instance of their lord.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2669-2680.)  The emperor was pleased with this request, and
 gladly gave them his daughter; for in doing so, he does not
 debase himself, nor diminish his honour in any way.  But he says
 that he had promised her to the Duke of Saxony, and that they
 would not be able to lead her away unless the emperor should come
 with a great army, so that the duke would be unable to do him any
 harm or injury while homeward bound.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2681-2706.)  When the messengers heard the emperor's reply,
 they took leave and departed.  They returned to their lord, and
 bore him the answer.  And the emperor selected a chosen company
 of the most experienced knights whom he could find, and took with
 him his nephew, in whose interests he had vowed never to marry a
 wife, but he will not respect this vow if he can once reach
 Cologne. (24)  Upon a certain day he leaves Greece and draws near
 to Germany, intending to take a wife despite all blame and
 reproach; but his honour will be smirched.  Upon reaching
 Cologne, he found that the emperor had assembled all his court
 for a festival.  When the company of the Greeks reached Cologne,
 there was such a great number of Greeks and Germans that it was
 necessary to lodge more than sixty thousand of them outside the
 city.
 </p><p>
 (Vv.2707-2724.)  Great was the crowd of people, and great the joy
 of the two emperors when they met.  When the barons had gathered
 in the vast palace, the emperor summoned his charming daughter.
 The maiden made no delay in coming straightway into the palace.
 She had been made very fair and shapely by the Creator, whose
 pleasure it had been to arouse the people's admiration.  God, who
 had fashioned her, never gave man a word which could adequately
 express such beauty as she possessed.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2725-2760.)  Fenice was the maiden's name, and for this
 there was good reason: (25) for if the Phoenix bird is unique as
 the most beautiful of all the birds, so Fenice, it seems to me,
 had no equal in beauty.  She was such a miracle and marvel that
 Nature was never able to make her like again.  In order to be
 more brief, I will not describe in words her arms, her body, her
 head and hands; for if I should live a thousand years, and if my
 skill were to double every day, yet should I waste all my time in
 trying to tell the truth about her.  I know very well, if I
 should undertake it, that I would exhaust my brain and waste my
 pains: it would be but misspent energy. (26)  The damsel hastened
 until she came into the palace, with head uncovered and face
 unveiled; and the radiance of her beauty lighted the palace more
 brightly than four carbuncles would have done.  Cliges stood, his
 over-cloak removed, in his uncle's presence.  The day outside was
 somewhat dark, but he and the maiden were both so fair that a ray
 shone forth from their beauty which illumined the palace, just as
 the morning sun shines clear and red.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2761-2792.)  I wish to attempt in a very few words to
 describe the beauty of Cliges.  He was in his flower, being now
 almost fifteen years of age.  He was more comely and charming
 than Narcissus who saw his reflection in the spring beneath the
 elm-tree, and, when he saw it, he loved it so that he died, they
 say, because he could not get it.  Narcissus was fair, but had
 little sense; (27) but as fine gold surpasses copper, so was
 Cliges better endowed with wisdom, and even then I have not said
 all.  His locks seemed made of fine gold, and his face was of a
 fresh rosy colour.  He had a well-formed nose and shapely mouth,
 and in stature he was built upon Nature's best pattern; for in
 him she had united gifts which she is wont to scatter wide. 
 Nature was so lavish with him that she gave him all she could,
 and placed all in one receptacle.  Such was Cliges, who combined
 good sense and beauty, generosity and strength.  He possessed the
 wood as well as the bark; he knew more of fencing and of the bow
 than did Tristan, King Mark's nephew, and more about birds and
 hounds than he. (28)  In Cliges there lacked no good thing.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2793-2870.)  Cliges stood in all his beauty before his
 uncle, and those who did not know who he was looked at him with
 eager curiosity.  And on the other hand, the interest was aroused
 of those who did not know the maiden: wonderingly they gaze upon
 her.  But Cliges, under the sway of love, let his eyes rest on
 her covertly, and withdrew them again so discreetly that in their
 passage to and fro no one could blame his lack of skill. 
 Blithely he looks upon the maid, but does not note that she
 repays him in kind.  Not flattering him, but in sincere love, she
 gives him her eyes, and takes back his.  This exchange seems good
 to her, and would have seemed to her better still had she known
 something of who he was.  But she knows nothing except that he is
 fair, and that, if she is ever to love any one for beauty's sake,
 she need not seek elsewhere to bestow her heart.  She handed over
 to him the possession of her eyes and heart, and he pledged his
 in turn to her.  Pledged?  Rather gave outright.  Gave?  Nay,
 upon my faith, I lie; for no one can give away his heart.  I must
 express it some other way.  I will not say it, as some have done
 who make two hearts dwell in one body, for it bears not even the
 semblance of truth that there should be in one body two hearts;
 and even if they could be so united, it would never seem true.
 But if it please you to heed my words, I shall be able explain
 how two hearts form but one without coming to be identified. 
 Only so far are they merged in one as the desire of each passes
 from one to the other, thus joining in one common desire; and
 because of this harmony of desire, there are some who are wont to
 say that each one has both hearts; but one heart cannot be in two
 places.  Each one always keeps his own heart, though the desire
 be shared by both, just as many different men may sing a song or
 tune in unison.  By this comparison I prove that for one body to
 contain two hearts it is not enough to know each other's wish,
 nor yet for one to know what the other loves and what he hates;
 just as voices which are heard together seem to be merged in one,
 and yet do not all come from one mouth, so it is with a body
 which can contain but one heart.  But there is no need of further
 argument, for other matters press upon me.  I must speak now of
 the damsel and of Cliges, and you shall hear of the Duke of
 Saxony, who has sent to Cologne a young nephew of his.  This
 youth informs the emperor that his uncle, the duke, sends word
 that he need expect no peace or trace with him, unless he sends
 to him his daughter, and that the one who is intending to carry
 her away with him had better not start home, for he will find the
 road occupied and well defended unless the maiden be surrendered.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 2871-3010.)  The youth spoke his message well, without pride
 and without insult.  But he found neither knight nor emperor who
 would answer him.  When he saw that they all held their peace and
 treated him with scorn, he left the court in defiant mood.  But
 youth and thirst for daring deeds made Cliges defy him in combat
 as he left.  For the contest they mount their steeds, three
 hundred of them on either side, exactly equal thus in strength.
 All the palace is quite emptied of knights and ladies, who mount
 to the balconies, battlements, and windows to see and watch those
 who were about to fight.  Even the maiden, whose will Love had
 subdued beneath his sway, sought for a point from which to see.
 She took her place at a window, where she sat with great delight,
 because from there she could get a view of him whom she holds
 secretly in her heart with no desire to remove him thence; for
 she will never love any other man.  But she does not know his
 name, nor who he is, nor of what race; for it is not proper to
 ask questions; but she yearns to hear tidings which will bring
 joy to her heart.  She looks out of the window at the shields
 with their gleaming gold, and she gazes at those who wear the
 shields about their necks, as they prepare for the trial at arms.
 But all her thoughts and glances soon rest upon one object, and
 to all others she is indifferent.  Whereever Cliges goes, she
 seeks to follow him with her eyes.  And he in turn does his best
 for her, and battles openly, in order that she at least may hear
 it said that he is bold and very skilled: thus she will be
 compelled to prize him for his prowess.  He attacks the duke's
 nephew, who was breaking many a lance and sorely discomfiting the
 Greeks.  But Cliges, who is displeased at this, braces himself
 firmly in his stirrups, and goes to strike him so speedily that
 in spite of himself he had to vacate the saddle-bows.  When he
 got up, the uproar was great; for the youth arose and mounted,
 thinking to avenge his shame.  But many a man only falls into
 deeper disgrace who thinks to avenge his shame when he has the
 chance.  The young man rushes at Cliges, who lowers his lance to
 meet him, and thrusts at him with such force that he carries him
 to earth again.  Now his shame is doubled, and all his followers
 are in dismay, seeing that they can never leave the field with
 honour; for not one of them is so valiant that he can keep his
 seat in the saddle when Cliges thrust reaches him.  But those of
 Germany and the Greeks are overjoyed when they see their party
 drive off the Saxons, who retreat discomfited.  With mockery they
 pursue them until they come up with them at a stream, into which
 they drive them for a plunge.  In the deepest part of the ford
 Cliges unhorsed the duke's nephew and so many of his men that
 they escaped grieving and sad in their shame and confusion.  But
 Cliges, twice victor, returned in glee, and entered a gate which
 was near the apartment where the maiden was; and as he passed
 through the gate she exacted as toll a tender glance, which he
 paid her as their eyes met.  Thus was the maiden subdued by the
 man.  But there is not a German of the lowland or highland,
 possessing the power of speech who does not cry: "God!  who is
 this in whom such beauty is radiant?  God!  how has it happened
 that so suddenly he has attained such great success?"  Thus one
 man and another asks: "Who is this youth, who is he, I say?"
 Thus, soon throughout the city it is known what his name is, and
 who is his father, and what pledge that was which had been made
 to him by the emperor.  So much was said and noised about that
 the news reached the ears of her who in her heart rejoiced
 because she could no more say that Love had made sport of her,
 nor had she any ground for complaint.  For Love has made her give
 her heart to the fairest, most courteous, and valiant man that
 could anywhere be found.  But some force must be employed, if she
 would gain possession of him who is not free do her will.  This
 makes her anxious and distraught.  For she has no one with whom
 to take counsel concerning him for whom she pines, but must waste
 herself in thought and vigils.  She becomes so affected by these
 cares that she loses her colour and grows wan, and it becomes
 plain to all that her loss of colour betokens an unfulfilled
 desire.  She plays less now than she used to do, and laughs less
 and loses her gaiety.  But she conceals her trouble and passes it
 off, if any one asks what her ailment is.  Her old nurse's name
 was Thessala, (29) who was skilled in necromancy, having been
 born in Thessaly, where devilish charms are taught and wrought;
 for the women of that country perform many a charm and mystic
 rite.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3011-3062.)  Thessala saw pale and wan her whom Love holds
 in his bonds, and thus she addressed her with advice: "God!" she
 said, "are you bewitched, my lady dear, that your face should be
 so pale?  I wonder what your trouble is.  Tell me, if you can,
 where this pain attacks you most, for if any one can cure you,
 you may safely trust me to give you back your health again.  I
 can cure the dropsy, gout, quinsy, and asthma; I am so expert in
 examining the urine and the pulse that you need consult no other
 physician.  And I dare say that I know more than ever Medea (30)
 knew of enchantments and of charms which tests have proven to be
 true.  I have never spoken to you of this, though I have cared
 for you all your life; and now I should not mention it did I not
 plainly see that you are so afflicted as to need my
 ministrations.  My lady, you will do well to tell me what your
 sickness is before its hold becomes more severe.  The emperor has
 committed you to me in order that I may care for you, and my
 devotion has been such that I have kept you safe and sound.  Now
 all my pains will come to naught if I do not relieve this malady. 
 Take care not to conceal from me whether this is sickness or
 something else."  The damsel dares not openly expose her desire
 in all its fullness for she is in fear lest she be disapproved
 and blamed.  And when she hears and understands how Thessala
 boasts and highly rates herself as being expert in enchantments,
 charms, and potions, she decides to tell her what is the cause of
 her pale and colourless face; but first she makes her promise to
 keep her secret and never to oppose her will.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3063-3216.)  "Nurse," she said, "I truly thought I felt no
 pain, but I shall soon feel differently.  For as soon as I begin
 to think about it, I feel great pain, and am dismayed.  But when
 one has no experience, how can one tell what is sickness and what
 is health?  My illness is different from all others; for when I
 wish to speak of it, it causes me both joy and pain, so happy I
 am in my distress.  And if it can be that sickness brings
 delight, then my trouble and joy are one, and in my illness
 consists my health.  So I do not know why I complain, for I know
 not whence my trouble comes, unless it is caused by my desire.
 Perchance my desire is my disease, but I find so much joy in it
 that the suffering it causes me is grateful, and there is so much
 contentment in my pain that it is sweet to suffer so.  Nurse
 Thessala, now tell me true, is not this a deceitful ill, to charm
 and torment me both at once?  I do not see how I can tell whether
 this is a disease or not.  Nurse, tell me now its name, nature,
 and character.  But understand well that I have no desire to be
 cured of it, for my distress is very dear to me."   Thessala, who
 was very wise about love and its symptoms knows full well from
 what she hears that it is love which is tormenting her; the
 tender, endearing terms she uses are certain proof that she is in
 love, for all other woes are hard to bear, except that alone
 which comes from love; but love transforms its bitterness into
 sweetness and joy, then often transforms them back again.  The
 nurse, who was expert in this matter, thus replies to her: "Have
 no fear, for I will tell you at once the name of your malady. 
 You told me, I believe, that the pain which you feel seems rather
 to be joy and health: now of such a nature is love-sickness, for
 in it, too, there is joy and bliss.  You are in love, then, as I
 can prove to you, for I find no pleasure in any malady save only
 in love.  All other sickness is always bad and horrible, but love
 is sweet and peaceable.  You are in love; of that I am sure, nor
 do I see any wrong in that.  But I shall consider it very wrong,
 if through some childish folly you conceal from me your heart."
 "Nurse, there is no need of your speaking so.  But first I must
 be sure and certain that under no circumstances will you speak of
 it to any living soul."  "My lady, surely the winds will speak of
 it before I do without your leave, and I will give you my word so
 to favour your desires that you may safely trust in having your
 joy fulfilled through my services."  "In that case, Nurse, I
 shall be cured.  But the emperor is giving me in marriage,
 wherefore I grieve and am sorrowful; for he who has won my heart
 is the nephew of him whom I must take.  And though he may find
 joy in me, yet is my joy forever lost, and no respite is
 possible.  I would rather be torn limb from limb than that men
 should speak of us as they speak of the loves of Iseut and
 Tristan, of so many unseemly stories are told that I should be
 ashamed to mention them.  I could never bring myself to lead the
 life that Iseut led.  Such love as hers was far too base; for her
 body belonged to two, whereas her heart was possessed by one.
 Thus all her life was spent, refusing her favours to neither one.
 But mine is fixed on one object, and under no circumstances will
 there be any sharing of my body and heart.  Never will my body be
 portioned out between two shareholders.  Who has the heart has
 the body, too, and may bid all others stand aside.  But I cannot
 clearly see how he whom I love can have my body when my father
 gives me to another, and his will I do not dare resist.  And when
 this other is lord of my body, and does something which
 displeases me, it is not right for me to summon another to my
 aid.  Nor can this man marry a wife without breaking his plighted
 word; for, unless injustice be done, Cliges is to have the empire
 after his uncle's death.  But I should be well served by you, if
 you were so skilful as to present him, to whom I am pledged and
 engaged, from having any claim upon me.  O Nurse, exert yourself
 to the end that he may not break the pledge which he gave to the
 father of Cliges, when he promised him solemnly never to take a
 wife in marriage.  For now, if he should marry me his promise
 would be broken.  But Cliges is so dear to me that I would rather
 be under ground than that he should ever lose through me a penny
 of the fortune which should be his.  May never a child be born to
 me to cause his disinheritance!  Nurse, now do your best, and I
 will always be your slave."  Then the nurse tells her and assures
 her that she will cast so many charms, and prepare so many
 potions and enchantments that she need never have any worry or
 fear concerning the emperor after he shall have drunk of the
 potion which she will give him; even when they shall lie together
 and she be at his side, she may be as secure as if there were a
 wall between them.  "But do not be alarmed, if, in his sleep, he
 sports with you, for when he is plunged in sleep he will have his
 sport with you, and he will be convinced that he has had you when
 wide awake, nor will he think it is all a dream, a fiction, and
 illusion.  Thus he will have his sport with you when asleep, he
 will think he is awake."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3217-3250.)  The maiden is highly pleased and delighted by
 the nurse's kindness and offer of help.  Her nurse inspires good
 hope in her by the promise which she makes, and which she binds
 herself to keep; with this hope she expects to obtain her desire,
 in spite of wearisome delay, for if Cliges' nature is as noble as
 she takes it to be he cannot fail to take pity upon her when he
 learns that she loves him, and that she has imposed virginity
 upon herself in order to insure his inheritance.  So the maiden
 believes her nurse, and puts full confidence in her.  One
 promises to the other, and gives her word, that this plot shall
 be kept so secret as never to be revealed.  At this point their
 conversation ceases, and the next morning the emperor summons his
 daughter.  At his command she goes to him.  But why should I
 weary you with details?  The two emperors have so settled the
 matter that the marriage is solemnised, and joy reigns in the
 palace.  But I do not wish to stop to describe all this in
 detail.  Rather will I address myself to Thessala, as she
 diligently prepares and tempers her potions.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3251-3328.)  Thessala steeps her drink, putting in spices in
 abundance to sweeten and temper it.  After having well beaten and
 mixed it, she strains it clear, with no sharp or bitter taste,
 for the spices she puts in give it a sweet and pleasant
 fragrance.  When the potion was prepared, the day had drawn to a
 close, the tables were set for supper, and the cloths were
 spread.  But Thessala delays the supper, because she must
 discover by what device and what agent she can have the potion
 served.  At supper, finally, all were seated, and more than six
 dishes had been passed, and Cliges served behind his uncle's
 place.  Thessala, as she watches him, thinks how ill he serves
 his own interests, and how he is assisting in his own
 disinheritance, and the thought torments and worries her.  Then
 in her kindness she conceives the plan of having the potion
 served by him to whom it will bring both joy and honour.  So
 Thessala summoned Cliges; and when he had come to her, he asked
 her why she had sent for him.  "Friend," said she, "I wish to
 present the emperor at this meal with a beverage which he will
 esteem highly, and I want him to taste no other to-night, either
 at supper or when he goes to bed.  I think he cannot fail to
 relish it, for he never has tasted a better drink or one that has
 cost so much.  And I warn you, take good care to let no one else
 drink of it, for there is but a little of it.  And this, too, I
 beg of you, not to let him know whence it came; but tell him it
 came about by chance that you found it among the presents, and
 tasted it yourself, and detected the aroma of the sweet spices in
 the air; then, seeing the wine to be all clear you poured it into
 his cup.  If by chance he should inquire, you can satisfy him
 with this reply.  But have no suspicion yourself, after what I
 have said, for the drink is pure and healthful, full excellent
 spices, and I think it may some day bring you joy."  When he
 heard that advantage would come to him, he took the potion and
 went away, for he did not know there was any harm in it.  He set
 it in a crystal cup before the emperor, who took it without
 question, trusting in his nephew.  After taking a long draught of
 the beverage, he straightway feels its strength, as it descends
 from head to heart, and rises again from heart to head, and
 penetrates every part of him without doing the slightest harm.
 And by the time they left the tables, the emperor had drunk so
 much of the pleasing drink that he can never escape it 
 influence. Every night he will sleep under its influence, and its
 effects will be such that he will think he is awake when sound
 asleep.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3329-3394.)  Now the emperor has been deceived.  Many
 bishops and abbots were present to bless and hallow the marriage-
 bed.  When the time came to retire, the emperor, as was his
 right, lay beside his wife that night.  "As was his right;" but
 the statement is inexact, for he neither kissed nor fondled her,
 yet they lay together in one bed.  At first the maiden trembled
 with fear and anxiety lest the potion should not act.  But it has
 so mastered him that he will never desire her or any other woman
 except in his sleep.  But when asleep he will have such sport
 with her as one may have in dreams, and he will think the dream
 is true.  Nevertheless, she is on her guard, and at first, holds
 aloof from him, so that he cannot approach her.  But now he must
 needs fall asleep; then he sleeps and dreams, though, the senses
 are awake, and he exerts himself to win the favours of the maid.
 while she, realising the danger, defends her virginity.  He woos
 her and calls her gently his sweetheart, and thinks he possesses
 her, but in vain.  But he is gratified by this vain semblance,
 embracing, kissing, and fondling an empty thing, seeing and
 speaking to no purpose, struggling and striving without effect.
 Surely the potion was effective in thus possessing and mastering
 him.  All his pains are of no avail, as he thinks and is
 persuaded that the fortress is won.  Thus he thinks and is
 convinced, when he desists after his vain efforts.  But now I may
 say once for all that his satisfaction was never more than this.
 To such relations with her he will for ever be condemned if
 indeed he can lead her to his own land; but before he can get her
 to safety, I judge that there is trouble in store for him.  For
 while he is on his journey home, the duke, to whom his bride had
 been betrothed, will appear upon the scene.  The duke gathered a
 numerous force, and garrisoned the frontiers, while at court he
 had his spies to inform him each day of the emperor's doings and
 preparations, and how long they are going to stay, and by what
 route they intend to return.  The emperor did not tarry long
 after the marriage, but left Cologne in high spirits.  The German
 emperor escorted him with a numerous company, fearing and
 dreading the force of the Duke of Saxony.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3395-3424.)  The two emperors pursued their journey until
 they were beyond Regensburg, where one evening they were encamped
 in a meadow by the Danube.  The Greeks were in their tents in the
 fields bordering upon the Black Forest.  Opposite to them the
 Saxons were lodged, spying upon them.  The duke's nephew stood
 alone upon a hill, whence he could reconnoitre for a chance to
 inflict some loss or harm on the enemy.  From that point of
 vantage he espied Cliges with three of his young men disporting
 themselves with lances and shields, eager for a conflict and
 shock of arms.  If he could get the chance the duke's nephew
 would gladly attack them and do them harm.  Starting out with
 five companions he concealed them in a valley close by a wood, so
 that the Greeks never saw them until they emerged from the
 valley; then the duke's nephew made an attack, and striking
 Cliges, wounded him slightly in the back.  Cliges, bending over,
 avoids the lance which passed him, inflicting only a slight hurt.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3425-3570.)  When Cliges felt himself wounded, he charged
 the youth, and struck him with such force that he drove his lance
 quite through his heart, and stretched him dead.  Then all the
 Saxons in fear of him betook themselves to flight through the
 woods.  And Cliges, ignorant of the ambuscade, courageously but
 imprudently leaving his companions behind, pursues them to the
 place where the duke's troops were in force preparing to attack
 the Greeks.  Alone he goes in hot pursuit after the youths, who,
 in despair over their lord whom they had lost, come running to
 the duke and tell him weeping of his nephew's death.  The duke
 saw no joke in this affair; and, swearing by God and all His
 saints that he will take no joy or pride in life so long as the
 slayer of his nephew remains alive, he adds that whoever will
 bring him his head will be his friend and will serve him well.
 Then a knight made boast that if he can find the guilty man, he
 will present him with Cliges' head.  Cliges follows the young men
 until he falls among the Saxons, when he is seen by him who had
 undertaken to carry off his head, and who starts after him
 without delay.  But Cliges haste had turned back to escape from
 his enemies and came in to where he had left his companions; he
 found none there, for they had returned to camp to relate their
 adventure.  And the emperor ordered to horse the Greeks and
 Germans in one band.  Soon all through the camp the knights are
 arming and mounting.  Meanwhile Cliges is hotly pursued by his
 enemy, all armed and with helmet closed.  Cliges, who never
 wished to be numbered among the coward and craven-hearted,
 notices that he comes alone.  First, the knight challenged him,
 calling him "fellow," unable to conceal his rage: "Young fellow,"
 he cried, "thou shalt leave me here a pledge for my lord whom
 thou hast killed.  If I do not carry away thy head with me, I am
 not worth a counterfeit besant.  I must make of it a present to
 the duke, and will accept no other forfeit.  In return for his
 nephew, I shall make such restitution that he will profit by the
 exchange."  Cliges hears him reproaching him thus boldly and with
 impudence.  "Vassal," he says, "be on your guard!  For I will
 defend my head, and you shall not get it without my leave."  Then
 the attack begins.  The other missed his blow, while Cliges
 struck him with such force that horse and rider went down
 together in one heap.  The horse fell upon him so heavily that he
 shattered completely one of his legs.  Cliges dismounted on the
 greensward and disarmed him.  When he had disarmed him, he
 appropriated his weapons, and cut off his enemy's head with the
 sword which had just now been his.  After severing his head he
 fixed it firmly on the point of his lance, thinking to offer it
 to the duke, to whom his nephew had promised to present his own
 if he could meet him in the strife.  Cliges had no sooner put on
 the dead man's helmet and taken his shield and mounted his steed,
 letting his own stray at large to terrify the Greeks, than he saw
 advancing with more than a hundred banners flying several full
 squadrons of Greeks and Germans.  Now the fierce and cruel
 struggles will soon begin between the Saxons and the Greeks.  As
 soon as Cliges sees his men advancing, he betakes himself toward
 the Saxons, his own men hotly pursuing him, and not knowing him
 in his disguise.  It is no wonder that his uncle is in despair
 and fear, when he sees the head he is carrying off.  So all the
 host pursue him fast, while Cliges leads them on to provoke a
 fight, until the Saxons see him drawing near.  But they, too, are
 quite misled by the arms with which he has armed and equipped
 himself.  He succeeds in deceiving and mocking them; for the duke
 and all the rest, when they saw him approaching lance in rest,
 cried out: "Here comes our knight!  On the point of his lance he
 carries Cliges' head, and the Greeks are hotly pursuing him!"
 Then, as they give their horses rein, Cliges spurs to meet the
 Saxons, crouching low beneath his shield, the lance out straight
 with the head affixed.  Now, though he was braver than a lion, he
 was no stronger than any other man.  Both parties think that he
 is dead, and while the Saxons rejoice, the Greeks and Germans
 grieve.  But before long the truth will out.  For Cliges no
 longer held his peace: but, rushing fiercely at a Saxon, he
 struck him with his ashen lance upon the head and in the breast,
 so that he made him lose his stirrups, and at the same time he
 cried aloud: "Strike gentlemen, for I am Cliges whom you seek.
 Come on, my bold and hardy knights!  Let none hold back, for the
 first joust is already won!  He is a coward who does not relish
 such a dish."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3571-3620.)  The emperor's joy was great when he heard the
 voice of his nephew Cliges summoning and exhorting them; he was
 greatly pleased and comforted.  But the duke is greatly chagrined
 now when he sees he is betrayed, unless his force should prove
 the stronger.  While he draws together his troops in serried
 lines, the Greeks do the same, and pressing them close, attack
 and rush upon them.  On both sides lances are lowered as they
 meet for the proper reception of a hostile host.  At the first
 shock shields are pierced and lances shattered, girths are cut
 and stirrups broken, while the horses of those who fall to earth
 are left without a rider.  But regardless of what any other does,
 Cliges and the duke meet in the fray; holding their lances low,
 they strike one another upon the shield with such violence that
 the strong and well-made lances fly into splinters.  Cliges was
 skilful on horseback, and sits straight in his saddle without
 shaking or losing his balance.  But the duke has lost his seat,
 and in spite of himself quits the saddle-bows.  Cliges struggled
 and strove to capture him and carry him away, but his strength
 did not suffice, for the Saxons were around about fighting to
 rescue him.  Nevertheless, Cliges escapes from the conflict
 without receiving harm and with a precious prize; for he makes
 off with the duke's steed, which was whiter than wool, and was
 worth more to a gentleman than the fortune of Octavian (31) at
 Rome.  The steed was an Arabian.  The Greeks and Germans are
 overjoyed to see Cliges on such a mount, for they had already
 remarked the excellence and beauty of the Arab steed.  But they
 were not on their guard against an ambuscade; and before they are
 aware of it great damage will be done.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3621-3748.)  A spy came to the duke, bringing him welcome
 news.  "Duke," says the spy, "not a man remains in all the
 encampment of the Greeks who is able to defend himself.  If thou
 wilt take my word for it, now is the time to have the emperor's
 daughter seized, while the Greeks are seen intent upon the battle
 and the strife.  Lend me a hundred of thy knights, and I will put
 the lady in their hands.  By an old and secluded path I will lead
 them so carefully that they will not be seen or met by any man of
 Germany, until they can seize the damsel in her tent and carry
 her off so handily that no resistance will be made."  At this the
 duke is highly pleased.  He sent a hundred and more tried knights
 with the spy, who so successfully conducted them that they
 carried the maiden away captive without exerting any force; for
 they could abduct her easily.  After carrying her some distance
 from the tents, they send her on under escort of twelve of their
 number whom they accompany but a short distance.  While the
 twelve led the damsel on, the others went to tell the duke how
 successful they had been.  The duke's desire being now satisfied,
 he at once makes a truce with the Greeks until next day.  The
 truce was sworn by both parties.  The duke's men then turned
 back, while the Greeks without delay repaired each man to his own
 tent.  But Cliges stays behind alone, stationed upon a little
 hill where no one caught sight of him, until he saw the twelve
 pass by with her whom they were carrying off at topmost speed.
 Cliges, in his thirst for glory, rides at them without delay; for
 he thinks within himself, and his heart tells him, that it is not
 for nothing that they flee.  So, as soon as he espied them, he
 spurred after them; and when they saw him coming on, a foolish
 thought occurred to them: "It is the duke," they said, "who
 comes.  Let us rein in a little; for he has left the troops and
 is riding hard after us alone."  Every man thinks that so it is.
 They all want to turn back to meet him, but each one wishes to go
 alone.  Meanwhile, Cliges must needs descend a deep valley
 between two mountains.  He would never have recognised their
 blazons, if they had not come to meet him, or if they had not
 awaited him.  Six of the twelve come to meet him in an encounter
 they will soon regret.  The other six stay with the damsel,
 leading her gently at a walk and easy jog.  And the six ride
 quickly on, spurring up the valley, until he who had the swiftest
 horse reached him first and cried aloud: "Hail, Duke of Saxony!
 God bless thee!  Duke, we have recovered thy lady.  The Greeks
 shall not get her now, for she shall be placed in thy hands."
 When Cliges heard the words this fellow shouts, his heart is not
 gay; rather is it strange that he does not lose his wits.  Never
 was any wild beast -- leopard, tiger, or lion -- upon seeing its
 young captured, so fierce and furious as Cliges, who sets no
 value upon his life if he deserts his sweetheart now.  He would
 rather die than not win her back.  In his trouble he feels great
 wrath, which gives him the courage he requires.  He urges and
 spurs the Arab steed, and rushes to give the Saxon such a blow
 upon his painted shield that without exaggeration, he makes his
 heart feel the lance.  This gives Cliges confidence.  He drove
 and spurred the Arab charger on for more than the space of an
 acre before he came upon the next Saxon, for they came up singly,
 each fearless of his predecessor's fare, for Cliges fights them
 one by one.  As he takes them thus individually, no one receives
 another's aid.  He makes a rush at the second one, who, like the
 first, thought to give him joy by telling him of his own evil
 fate.  But Cliges has no concern to heed his talk and idle
 charter.  Thrusting his lance into his body so that the blood
 spurts out when it is withdrawn, he deprives him of life and the
 gift of speech.  After these two he meets the third, who expects
 to find him in good humour and to make him rejoice over his own
 mischance. Spurring eagerly he came up to him; but before he has
 time to say a word, Cliges ran a fathom of his lance through the
 middle of his body, leaving him senseless on the ground.  To the
 fourth he gives such a blow that he leaves him fainting on the
 field.  After the fourth he goes at the fifth, and after him he
 attacks the sixth.  None of them could defend himself, but each
 was left silent and mute.  He stood in less fear of the others
 now, and more hardily pressed after them, taking no further
 thought of the six dead men.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3749-3816.)  Feeling no further care for them, he starts to
 present a debt of shame and woe to the others who are leading the
 maid away.  He caught up with them, and made such an onslaught
 upon them as a hungry and ravenous wolf makes when leaping upon
 its prey.  Now he feels his luck has come, when he can display
 his chivalry and bravery openly before her who is his very life.
 Now may he die, if he does not rescue her!  And she, too, is at
 death's door from anxiety for his sake, though she does not know
 that he is no near.  Lance in rest, Cliges made an attack which
 pleased him well; for he struck first one Saxon and then another,
 so that with a single rush he carried them both to earth, though
 it cost him his ashen lance.  And they both fall in such
 distress, being wounded in the body, that they have no power to
 rise again and do him any harm or ill.  The other four in bitter
 rage join in an attack upon Cliges; but he neither quails nor
 trembles, and they are unable to dislodge him from his seat.
 Quickly drawing his keen sword from its sheath, in order to
 please her who awaits his love, he rode hard at a Saxon and,
 striking him with his whetted blade, he severed his head and half
 his neck from the body: such was the limit of his pity.  Fenice,
 who witnesses what transpires, does not know yet that this is
 Cliges.  She wishes that it were he, indeed, but because of the
 present danger she says to herself that she would not have him
 there.  Thus, doubly she shows the devotion of a sweetheart,
 fearing at once his death, and desiring that honour may be his. 
 And Cliges sword in hand attacks the other three, who face him
 bravely and puncture and split his shield.  But they are unable
 to lay hands upon him, or to pierce the meshes of his hauberk.
 And whatever Cliges reaches cannot stand against his blow, but
 must needs be split and torn apart; for he turns faster than a
 top driven and lashed by the whip.  Boldness and love, which
 holds him enthralled, make him eager for the fray.  He pressed
 the Saxons so hard that he left them all dead and defeated, some
 only wounded, and others dead -- except one whom he let escape,
 disdaining to kill him when left alone at his mercy; besides, he
 wished him to tell the duke of the loss and injury he had
 sustained.  But before this fellow left Cliges, he begged him to
 tell him his name, which later he repeated to the duke, thus
 rousing his bitter ire.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3817-3864.)  Now bad luck had fallen to the duke, who was in
 great distress and grief.  And Cliges takes back Fenice, whose
 love torments and troubles him.  If he does not confess to her
 now, love will long be his enemy, and hers too, if she holds her
 peace and speaks not the word which will bring him joy; for now
 each can tell the other privily the thoughts that lie within the
 heart.  But they so fear to be refused that they dare not reveal
 their hearts.  For his part, he fears lest she will not accept
 his love, whereas she, too, would have spoken out had she not
 feared to be rejected.  In spite of this, the eyes of each reveal
 the hidden thought, if only they had heeded this evidence.  They
 converse by glance of eye, but their tongues are so cowardly that
 they dare not speak in any wise of the love which possesses them.
 No wonder if she hesitates to begin, for a maid must be a simple
 and shrinking thing; but he -- why does he wait and hold back who
 was so bold for her just now, but now in her presence is
 cowardly?  God!  whence comes this fear, that he should shrink
 from a lonely girl, feeble and timid, simple and mild?  It is as
 if I should see the dog flee before the hare, and the fish chase
 the beaver, the lamb the wolf, and the dove the eagle.  In the
 same fashion the labourer would forsake his pick with which he
 strives to earn a livelihood, and the falcon would flee from the
 duck, and the gerfalcon from the heron, and the pike from the
 minnow, and the stag would chase the lion, and everything would
 be reversed.  Now I feel within me the desire to give some reason
 why it should happen to true lovers that they lose their sense
 and boldness to say what they have in mind when they have leisure
 and place and time.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3865-3914.)  Ye who are interested in the art of Love, who
 do faithfully maintain the customs and usage of his court, who
 never failed to obey his law, whatever the result might be, tell
 me if there is anything that pleases because of love without
 causing us to tremble and grow pale.  If any one oppose me in
 this, I can at once refute his argument; for whoever does not
 grow pale and tremble, whoever does not lose his senses and
 memory, is trying to filch and get by stealth what does not by
 right belong to him.  The servant who does not fear his master
 ought not to remain in his employ nor do his service.  He who
 does not esteem his lord does not fear him, and whoever does not
 esteem him does not hold him dear, but rather tries to deceive
 him and to steal from him what is his.  The servant ought to
 tremble with fear when his master calls or summons him.  And
 whoever commits himself to Love owns him as his lord and master,
 and is bound to do him reverence and fear him much and honour
 him, if he wishes to be numbered in his court.  Love without
 alarm or fear is like a fire without flame or heat, day without
 sun, comb without honey, summer without flowers, winter without
 frost, sky without moon, and a book without letters.  Such is my
 argument in refutation, for where fear is absent love is not to
 be mentioned.  Whoever would love must needs feel fear, for
 otherwise he cannot be in love.  But let him fear only her whom
 he loves, and for her sake be brave against all others.  Then if
 he stands in awe of his lady-love Cliges is guilty of nothing
 wrong.  Even so, he would not have failed to speak straightway
 with her of love, whatever the outcome might have been, had it
 not been that she was his uncle's wife.  This causes the
 festering of his wound, and it torments and pains him the more
 because he dares not utter what he fain would say.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3915-3962.)  Thus they make their way back to their own
 people, and if they speak of anything it is nothing of much
 concern.  Each seated on a white horse, they rode rapidly toward
 the camp, which was plunged in great sorrow.  The whole army is
 beside itself with grief, but they are altogether wrong in
 supposing Cliges to be dead: hence their bitter and poignant
 grief.  And for Fenice, too, they are in dismay, thinking never
 to win her back again.  Thus, for her and him the whole army is
 in great distress.  But soon upon their return the whole affair
 will change its aspect; for now they have reached the camp again,
 and have quickly changed the grief to joy.  Joy returns and
 sorrow flees.  All the troops come together and sally forth to
 welcome them.  The two emperors, upon hearing the report about
 Cliges and the damsel, go to meet them with joyful hearts, and
 each can hardly wait to hear how Cliges found and recovered the
 empress.  Cliges tells them, and, as they listen, they are amazed
 and are loud in their praises of his courage and devotion.  But,
 for his part, the duke is furious, swearing and proclaiming his
 determination to fight Cliges, if he dares, in single combat; and
 it shall be agreed that if Cliges wins the battle the emperor
 shall proceed unchallenged, and freely take the maiden with him,
 and if he should kill or defeat Cliges, who had done him such
 injury, then let there be no truce or stay to prevent each party
 from doing its best.  This is what the duke desires, and by an
 interpreter of his, who knew both the Greek and the German
 tongues, he announces to the two emperors his desire thus to
 arrange the battle.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 3963-4010.)  The messenger delivered his message so well in
 both languages that all could understand it.  The entire army was
 in an uproar, saying that may God forbid that Cliges ever engage
 in the battle.  Both emperors are in a fright, but Cliges throws
 himself at their feet and begs them not to grieve, but if ever he
 did them any favour, he prays them to grant him this battle as a
 guerdon and reward.  And if the right to fight should be denied
 him, then he will never again serve for a single day his uncle's
 cause and honour.  The emperor, who loved his nephew as he
 should, raised him by the hand and said: "Fair nephew, I am
 deeply grieved to know you are so keen to fight; for after joy,
 sorrow is to be expected. (32)  You have made me glad, I cannot
 deny it; but it is hard for me to yield the point and send you
 forth to this battle, when I see you still so young.  And yet I
 know you to be so confident of yourself that I dare not ever
 refuse anything that you choose to ask of me.  Be assured that,
 merely to gratify you, it should be done; but if my request has
 any power, you would never assume this task."  "My lord, there is
 no need of further speech," said Cliges; "may God damn me, if I
 would take the whole world, and miss this battle!  I do not know
 why I should seek from you any postponement or long delay."  The
 emperor weeps with pity, while Cliges sheds tears of joy when the
 permission to fight is granted him.  Many a tear was shed that
 day, and no respite or delay was asked.  Before the hour of
 prime, by the duke's own messenger the challenge to battle was
 sent back to him accepted as he had proposed.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4011-4036.)  The duke, who thinks and confidently trusts
 that Cliges will be unable to stave off death and defeat at his
 hands, has himself quickly armed.  Cliges, who is anxious for the
 fight, feels no concern as to how he shall defend himself.  He
 asks the emperor for his arms, and desires him to dub him a
 knight.  So the emperor generously gives him his arms, and he
 takes them, his heart being keen for the battle which he
 anticipates with joy and eagerness.  No time is lost in arming
 him.  And when he was armed from head to foot, the emperor, all
 sorrowing, girds the sword upon his side.  Thus Cliges completely
 armed mounts his white Arab steed; from his neck he hangs by the
 straps an ivory shield, such as will never break or split; and
 upon it there was neither colour nor design.  All his armour was
 white, and the steed, and the harness, too, was all whiter than
 any snow.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4037-4094.)  Cliges and the duke, now being armed, summon
 each other to meet half way, and they stipulate that their men
 shall take their stand on either side, but without their swords
 and lances, under oath and pledge that not a man will be so rash,
 so long as the battle lasts, as to dare to move for any reason,
 any more than he would dare to pluck out his own eye.  When this
 had been agreed upon, they came together, each yearning ardently
 for the glory he hopes to win and for the joy of victory.  But
 before a single blow was dealt, the empress has herself borne
 thither, solicitous for Cliges' fate.  It seems to her that if he
 dies, she, too, must needs do so.  No comfort can avail to keep
 her from joining him in death, for, without him, life has no joys
 for her.  When all were gathered on the field -- high and low,
 young and old -- and the guards had taken their place, then both
 seized their lances and rushed together so savagely that they
 both broke their lances and fell to the ground, unable to keep
 their saddles.  But not being wounded, they quickly get upon
 their feet and attack each other without delay.  Upon their
 resonant helmets they play such a tune with swords that it seems
 to those who are looking on that the helmets are on fire and send
 forth sparks.  And when the swords rebound in air, gleaming
 sparks fly off from them as from a smoking piece of iron which
 the smith beats upon his anvil after, drawing it from the forge.
 Both of the vassals are generous in dealing blows in great
 plenty, and each has the best of intentions to repay quickly what
 he borrows; neither one holds back from repaying promptly capital
 and interest, without accounting and without measure.  But the
 duke is much chagrined with anger and discomfiture when he fails
 to defeat and slay Cliges in the first assault.  Such a
 marvellously great and mighty blow he deals him that he falls at
 his feet upon his knee.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4095-4138.)  When this blow brought Cliges down, the emperor
 was struck with fear, and would have been no more dismayed had he
 himself been beneath the shield.  Nor could Fenice in her fear
 longer contain herself, whatever the effect might be, from
 crying: "God help him!" as loud as she could.  But that was the
 only word she uttered, for straightway her voice failed her, and
 she fell forward upon her face, which was somewhat wounded by the
 fall.  Two high nobles raised her up and supported her upon her
 feet until she returned to consciousness.  But in spite of her
 countenance, none who saw her guessed why she had swooned.  Not a
 man there blamed her, but rather praised her for her act, for
 each one supposes that she would have done the same thing for
 him, if he had been in Cliges' place, but in all this they are
 quite astray.  Cliges heard, and well understood, the sound of
 Fenice's cry.  Her voice restored his strength and courage, as he
 leaped up quickly, and came with fury, toward the duke, so
 charging and attacking him that the duke in turn was now
 dismayed.  For now he found him more fierce for the fray,
 stronger and more agile and energetic than when at first they
 came together.  And because he feared his onslaught, he cried:
 "Young man, so help me God, I see thou art brave and very bold.
 If it were not for my nephew now, whom I shall never more forget,
 I would gladly make peace with thee, and leave thy quarrel
 without interfering in it more."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4139-4236.)  "Duke," says Cliges, "what is your pleasure
 now?  Must one not surrender his right when he is unable to
 recover it?  When one of two evils must be faced, one should
 choose the lesser one.  Your nephew was not wise to become
 angrily embroiled with me.  You may be sure that I shall treat
 you in like fashion, if I get the chance, unless you agree to my
 terms of peace."  The duke, to whom it seems that Cliges' vigour
 is steadily growing, thinks that he had better desist in mid-
 career before he is utterly undone.  Nevertheless, he does not
 openly give in, but says: "Young man, I see thou art skilful and
 alert and not lacking in courage.  But thou art yet too young;
 therefore I feel assured that if I defeat and kill thee I shall
 gain no praise or fame, and I should never like to confess in the
 hearing of a man of honour that I had fought with thee, for I
 should but do thee honour, and myself win shame.  But if thou art
 aware of honour's worth, it will always be a glorious thing for
 thee to have withstood me for two rounds at arms.  So now my
 heart and feeling bid me let thee have thy way, and no longer
 fight with thee." (33)  "Duke," says Cliges, "that will not do. 
 In the hearing of all you must repeat those words, for it shall
 never be said and noised abroad that you let me off and had mercy
 on me.  In the hearing of all those who are gathered here, you
 must repeat your words, if you wish to be reconciled with me." 
 So the duke repeats his words in the hearing of all.  Then they
 make peace and are reconciled.  But however the matter be
 regarded Cliges had all the honour and glory of it, and the
 Greeks were greatly pleased.  For their part, the Saxons could
 not laugh, all of them having plainly seen that their lord was
 worn out and exhausted just now; but there is no doubt at all
 that, if he could have helped himself, this peace would never
 have been made, and that Cliges' soul would have been drawn from
 his body had it proven possible.  The duke goes back to Saxony
 sorrowing, downcast, and filled with shame; for of his men there
 are not even two who do not regard him as worsted, defeated, and
 disgraced.  The Saxons with all their shame have now returned to
 Saxony, while the Greeks without delay make their way with joy
 and gladness toward Constantinople, for Cliges by his prowess has
 opened the way for them.  The emperor of Germany no longer
 follows and convoys them.  Taking leave oú the Greek troops and
 of his daughter and Cliges, and finally of the emperor, he stayed
 behind in Germany.  And the emperor of the Greeks goes off
 happily and in joyous mood.  Cliges, brave and courteous, calls
 to mind his sire's command.  If his uncle, the emperor, will give
 him his permission, he will go and ask him for leave to return to
 Britain and there converse with his great-uncle, the King; for he
 is desirous of seeing and knowing him.  So he presents himself
 before the emperor, and requests that he consent to let him go to
 Britain to see his uncle and his friends.  Gently he proffered
 his request.  But his uncle refused, when he had listened to the
 request he made.  "Fair nephew," he said, "it is not my will that
 you should wish to leave me.  I shall never give you without
 regret this permission to go away.  For it is my pleasure and
 desire that you should be my companion and lord, with me, of all
 my empire."
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4237-4282.)  Now Cliges hears something that does not suit
 him when his uncle refuses the prayer and request he made.  "Fair
 sire," said he, "I am not brave and wise enough, nor would it be
 seemly for me to join myself with you or any one else in the duty
 of governing this empire; I am too young and inexperienced.  They
 put gold to the test when they wish to learn if it is fine.  And
 so it is my wish, in brief, to try to prove myself, wherever I
 can find the test.  In Britain, if I am brave, I can apply myself
 to the whetstone and to the real true test, whereby my prowess
 shall be proved.  In Britain are the gentlemen whom honour and
 prowess distinguish.  And he who wishes to win honour should
 associate himself with them, for honour is won and gained by him
 who associates with gentlemen.  And so I ask you for leave to go,
 and you may be very sure that if you do not grant me the boon and
 send me thither I shall go without your leave."  "Fair nephew, I
 will give you leave, seeing you are so disposed that I cannot
 keep you back either by force or prayer of mine.  Now since
 prayer, prohibition, and force do not avail, may God give you the
 desire and inclination promptly to return.  I wish you to take
 with you more than a bushel of gold and silver, and I will give
 for your pleasure such horses as you may choose."  He had no
 sooner spoken than Cliges bowed before him.  All that the
 emperor, mentioned and promised him was straightway brought
 thither.
 </p><p>
 (Vv. 4283-4574.)  Cliges took all the money and companions that
 he wished and needed.  For his personal use he took four horses
 of different colours: one white, one sorrel, one fallow red, and
 one black.  But I must have passed over something which it is not
 proper to omit.  Cliges goes to ask and obtain leave to depart
 from his sweetheart Fenice; for he wishes to commend her to God's
 safe keeping.  Coming before her, he throws himself upon his
 knees, weeping so bitterly that the tears moisten his tunic and
 ermine, the while keeping his eyes upon the ground; for he dares
 not raise his eyes to her, as if he were guilty of some crime and
 misdeed toward her, for which he seems overcome with shame.  And
 Fenice, who timidly and fearfully looks at him, does not know the
 occasion of his coming, and speaks to him with difficulty. 
 "Rise, friend and fair sir!  Sit here beside me. and weep no
 more, and tell me what your pleasure is."  "Lady, what shall I
 say, and what leave unsaid?  I come to ask your leave."  "Leave?
 To do what?"  "Lady, I must go off to Britain."  "Then tell me
 what your business is, before I give you leave to go."  "Lady, my
 father, before he departed this life and died, begged me not to
 fail to go to Britain as soon as I should be made a knight.  I
 should not wish for any reason to disregard his command.  I must
 not falter until I have accomplished the journey.  It is a long
 road from here to Greece, and if I should go thither, the journey
 would be too long from Constantinople to Britain.  But it is
 right that I should ask leave from you to whom I altogether
 belong."  Many a covert sigh and sob marked the separation.  But
 the eyes of none were keen enough, nor the ears of any sharp
 enough, to learn from what he saw and heard that there was any
 love between these two.  Cliges, in spite of the grief he felt,
 took his leave at the first opportunity.  He is full of thought
 as he goes away, and so are the emperor and many others who stay
 behind.  But more than all the others, Fenice is pensive: she
 finds no bottom or bound to the reflections which occupy her, so
 abundantly are her cares multiplied.  She was still oppressed
 with thought when she arrived in Greece.  There she was held in
 great honour as mistress and empress; but her heart and mind
 belong to Cliges, wherever he goes, and she wishes her heart
 never to return to her, unless it is brought back to her by him
 who is perishing of the same disease with which he has smitten
 her.  If he should get well, she would recover too, but he will
 never be its victim without her being so as well.  Her trouble
 appears in her pale and changed colour; for the fresh, clear, and
 radiant colour which Nature had given her is now a stranger to
 her face.  She often weeps and often sighs.  Little she cares for
 her empire and for the riches that are hers.  She always
 cherishes in her remembrance the hour when Cliges went away, and
 the leave he took of her, how he changed colour and grew pale,
 and how tearful his expression was, for he came to weep in her
 presence humbly and simply upon his knees, as if constrained to
 worship her.  All this is sweet and pleasant for her to remember
 and think about.  And afterward, as a little treat, she takes on
 her tongue instead of spice a sweet word which for all Greece she
 would not wish him to have used contrary to the sense she had
 understood when he first had uttered it; for she lives upon no
 other dainty, and there is nothing else that pleases her.  This
 word alone sustains and nourishes her, and assuages all her pain.
 She cares to eat and drink of no other dish or beverage, for when
 the two lovers came to part, Cliges had said he was "altogether
 hers."  This word is so sweet and tastes so good that from the
 tongue it stirs her heart, and she takes it into her mouth and
 heart to be all the more sure of it.  Under any other lock she
 would not dare to store this treasure.  Nowhere could it be
 lodged so well as in her own bosom.  She will never leave it
 exposed at any price, being in such fear of robbers and thieves.
 But there is no ground for her anxiety, and she need have no fear
 of the birds of prey, for her treasure is not movable, but is
 rather like a house which cannot be destroyed by fire or flood,
 but will always stay fixed in a single place.  But she feels no
 confidence in the matter, so she worries and strives to find and
 hold some ground on which to stand, interpreting the situation in
 divers ways.  She both opposes and defends her position, and
 engages in the following argument: "With what intention should
 Cliges say `I am altogether yours' unless it was love that
 prompted him?  What power can I have over him that he should
 esteem me so highly as to make me the mistress of his heart?  Is
 he not more fair than I, and of higher rank than I?  I see in it
 naught but love, which could vouchsafe me such a boon.  I, who
 cannot escape its power, will prove by my own case that unless he
 loved me he would never say that he was mine; unless love holds
 him in its toils, Cliges could never say that he was mine any
 more than I could say that I was altogether his unless love had
 put me in his hands.  For if he loves me not, at least he does
 not fear me.  I hope that love which gives me to him will in
 return give him to me.  But now I am sore dismayed because it is
 so trite a word, and I may simply be deceived, for many there be
 who in flattering terms will say even to a total stranger, `I and
 all that I have are yours,' and they are more idle chatterers
 than the jays.  So I do not know what to think, for it might well
 turn out that he said it just to flatter me.  Yet I saw his
 colour change, and I saw him weeping piteously.  In my judgment,
 the tears and his face confused and pale were not produced by
 treachery, nor were they the fruits of trickery.  Those eyes from
 which I saw tears roll down were not guilty of falsehood.  Signs
 enough of love I saw, if I know anything about it.  Yes, in an
 evil hour I thought of love; woe is me that I ever learned it,
 for the experience has been bitter.  Has it indeed?  Yes, verily.
 I am dead when I cannot see him who has stolen my heart away by
 his cajoling flattery, because of which my heart leaves its
 dwelling, and will not abide with me, hating my home and
 establishment.  In truth I have been ill treated by him who has
 my heart in his keeping.  He who robs me and takes what is mine
 cannot love me, of that I am sure.  But am I sure?  Why then did
 he weep?  Why?  It was not in vain, for there was cause enough. 
 I must not assume that I was the cause of it, for one is always
 loath to leave people whom one loves and knows.  So it is not
 strange if he was sorry and grieved and if he wept when he left
 some one whom he knew.  But he who gave him this advice to go and
 dwell in Britain could not have smitten me more effectively.  He
 is cut to the quick who loses his heart.  He who deserves it,
 should be treated ill; but I have never deserved such treatment.
 Alas, unhappy one, why has Cliges killed me when I am innocent?
 But I am unjust to accuse him thus without cause.  Surely Cliges
 would never have deserted me if his heart were like mine.  I am
 sure his heart is not like mine.  And if my heart is lodged in
 his it will never draw away, and his will never part from mine,
 for my heart follows him secretly: they have formed such a goodly
 company.  But, after all, to tell the truth, they are very
 different and contrary.  How are they different and contrary?
 Why, his is the master and mine the slave; and the slave can have
 no will of his own, but only do his master's will and forsake all
 other affairs.  But what reference has that to me?  My heart and
 service are no concern to him.  This arrangement distresses me,
 that one is master of us both.  Why is not my heart as
 independent as his?  Then their power would be equalised.  My
 heart is now a prisoner, unable to move itself unless his moves
 as well.  And whether his heart wanders or stays still, mine must
 needs prepare to follow him in his train.  God!  why are our
 bodies not so near one another that I could in some way bring
 back my heart!  Bring back?  Foolish one, if I should remove it
 from its joy I should be the death of it.  Let it stay there!  I
 have no desire to dislodge it, but rather wish that it tarry with
 its lord until he feel some pity for it.  For rather over there
 than here ought he to have mercy on his servant, because they are
 both in a foreign land.  If my heart knows well the language of
 flattery, as is necessary for the courtier, it will be rich ere
 it comes back.  Whoever wishes to stand in the good graces of his
 lord and sit beside him on his right, to be in the fashion now-a-
 days, must remove the feather from his head, even when there
 is none there.  But there is one bad feature of this practice:
 while he is smoothing down his master, who is filled with evil
 and villainy, he will never be so courteous as to tell him the
 truth; rather he makes him think and believe that no one could
 compare with him in prowess and in knowledge, and the master
 thinks that he is speaking the truth.  That man does not know
 himself who takes another's word about qualities which he does
 not possess.  For even if he is a wicked and insolent wretch, and
 as cowardly as a hare, mean, crazy, and misshapen, and a villain
 both in word and deed -- yet some man will praise him to his face
 who behind his back will mock at him.  But when in his hearing he
 speaks of him to some other, he praises him, while his lord
 pretends not to hear what they say between themselves; if,
 however, he thought that he would not be heard, he would say
 something his master would not like.  And if his master is
 pleased to lie, the servant is all ready with his consent, and
 will never be backward in averring that all his master says is
 true.  He who frequents courts and lords must ever be ready with
 a lie.  So, too, must my heart do if it would find favour with
 its lord.  Let it flatter and be obsequious.  But Cliges is such
 a knight, so fair, so open, and so loyal, that my heart, in
 praising him, need never be false or perfidious, for in him there
 is nothing to be improved.  Therefore I wish my heart to serve
 him, for, as the people's proverb runs, `He who serves a noble
 man is bad indeed if he does not improve in his company.'"
