 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>THAT cry's from the first cuckoo of the year.<br> I wished before it ceased.</p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>                            Nor bird nor beast<br> Could make me wish for anything this day,<br> Being old, but that the old alone might die,<br> And that would be against God's Providence.<br> Let the young wish. But what has brought you here?<br> Never until this moment have we met<br> Where my goats browse on the scarce grass or leap<br> From stone to stone.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>             I am looking for strayed sheep;<br> Something has troubled me and in my trouble<br> I let them stray. I thought of rhyme alone, <a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a>D<br> For rhyme can beat a measure out of trouble<br> And make the daylight sweet once more; but when<br> I had driven every rhyme into its place<br> The sheep had gone from theirs.</p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>                          I know right well<br> What turned so good a shepherd from his charge.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>He that was best in every country sport<br> And every country craft, and of us all<br> Most courteous to slow age and hasty youth,<br> Is dead.</p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>The boy that brings my griddle cake<br> Brought the bare news.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>              He had thrown the crook away<br> And died in the great war beyond the sea.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_259"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 259</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>He had often played his pipes among my hills,<br> And when he played it was their loneliness,<br> The exultation of their stone, that cried<br> Under his fingers.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>                      I had it from his mother,<br> And his own flock was browsing at the door.</p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>How does she bear her grief? There is not a shepherd<br> But grows more gentle when he speaks her name,<br> Remembering kindness done, and how can I,<br> That found when I had neither goat nor grazing<br> New welcome and old wisdom at her fire<br> Till winter blasts were gone, but speak of her<br> Even before his children and his wife.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>She goes about her house erect and calm<br> Between the pantry and the linen chest, <a name="page_260"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 260</font></a><br> Or else at meadow or at grazing overlooks<br> Her labouring men, as though her darling lived,<br> But for her grandson now; there is no change<br> But such as I have seen upon her face<br> Watching our shepherd sports at harvest-time<br> When her son's turn was over.</p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>                               Sing your song,<br> I too have rhymed my reveries, but youth<br> Is hot to show whatever it has found,<br> And till that's done can neither work nor wait.<br> Old goatherds and old goats, if in all else<br> Youth can excel them in accomplishment,<br> Are learned in waiting.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>                     You cannot but have seen<br> That he alone had gathered up no gear,<br> Set carpenters to work on no wide table,<br> On no long bench nor lofty milking shed<br> As others will, when first they take possession,<br> But left the house as in his father's time<br> As though he knew himself, as it were, a cuckoo, <a name="page_261"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 261</font></a><br> No settled man. And now that he is gone<br> There's nothing of him left but half a score<br> Of sorrowful, austere, sweet, lofty pipe tunes.</p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>You have put the thought in rhyme.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>                             I worked all day,<br> And when ’twas done so little had I done<br> That maybe "I am sorry" in plain prose<br> Had sounded better to your mountain fancy.<br>                                        [<i>He sings</i>.<br> "Like the speckled bird that steers<br> Thousands of leagues oversea,<br> And runs for a while or a while half-flies<br> Upon his yellow legs through our meadows,<br> He stayed for a while; and we<br> Had scarcely accustomed our ears<br> To his speech at the break of day,<br> Had scarcely accustomed our eyes<br> To his shape at the rinsing pool<br> Among the evening shadows,<br> When he vanished from ears and eyes.<br> I had wished a dear thing on that day<br> I heard him first, but man is a fool."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_262"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 262</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>You sing as always of the natural life,<br> And I that made like music in my youth<br> Hearing it now have sighed for that young man<br> And certain lost companions of my own.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>They say that on your barren mountain ridge<br> You have measured out the road that the soul treads<br> When it has vanished from our natural eyes;<br> That you have talked with apparitions.</p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>                                     Indeed<br> My daily thoughts since the first stupor of youth<br> Have found the path my goats' feet cannot find.</p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>Sing, for it may be that your thoughts have plucked<br> Some medicable herb to make our grief<br> Less bitter.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_263"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 263</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">GOATHERD</p>  
 <p>They have brought me from that ridge<br> Seed pods and flowers that are not all wild poppy.<br>                                         [<i>Sings</i>.<br> "He grows younger every second<br> That were all his birthdays reckoned<br> Much too solemn seemed;<br> Because of what he had dreamed,<br> Or the ambitions that he served,<br> Much too solemn and reserved.<br> Jaunting, journeying<br> To his own dayspring,<br> He unpacks the loaded pern<br> Of all ’twas pain or joy to learn,<br> Of all that he had made.<br> The outrageous war shall fade;<br> At some old winding whitethorn root<br> He'll practise on the shepherd's flute,<br> Or on the close-cropped grass<br> Court his shepherd lass,<br> Or run where lads reform our daytime<br> Till that is their long shouting playtime;<br> Knowledge he shall unwind<br> Through victories of the mind,<br> Till, clambering at the cradle side,<br> He dreams himself his mother's pride,<br> All knowledge lost in trance<br> Of sweeter ignorance."</p>  
 <p><a name="page_264"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 264</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">SHEPHERD</p>  
 <p>When I have shut these ewes and this old ram<br> Into the fold, we'll to the woods and there<br> Cut out our rhymes on strips of new-torn bark<br> But put no name and leave them at her door.<br> To know the mountain and the valley have grieved<br> May be a quiet thought to wife and mother,<br> And children when they spring up shoulder high.</p>
