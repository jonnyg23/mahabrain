 <p><i>The deck of an ancient ship. At the right of the stage is the mast, with a large square sail hiding a great deal of the sky and sea on that side. The tiller is at the left of the stage; it is a long oar coming through an opening in the bulwark. The deck rises in a series of steps behind the tiller, and the stern of the ship curves overhead. When the play opens there are four persons upon the deck. </i>AIBRIC<i> stands by the tiller. </i>FORGAEL<i> sleeps upon the raised portion of the deck towards the front of the stage. Two </i>SAILORS<i> are standing near to the mast, on which a harp is hanging</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>Has he not led us into these waste seas<br> For long enough?</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p align="right">Aye, long and long enough.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>We have not come upon a shore or ship<br> These dozen weeks.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>                And I had thought to make<br> A good round sum upon this cruise, and turn--<br> For I am getting on in life--to something<br> That has less ups and downs than robbery.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>I am so tired of being bachelor<br> I could give all my heart to that Red Moll<br> That had but the one eye.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>Can no bewitchment<br> Transform these rascal billows into women<br> That I may drown myself?</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>                          Better steer home,<br> Whether he will or no; and better still<br> To take him while he sleeps and carry him<br> And drop him from the gunnel.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>                              I dare not do it.<br> Were't not that there is magic in his harp, <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a><br> I would be of your mind; but when he plays it<br> Strange creatures flutter up before one's eyes,<br> Or cry about one's ears.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p align="right">Nothing to fear.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>Do you remember when we sank that galley<br> At the full moon?</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p align="right">He played all through the night.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>Until the moon had set; and when I looked<br> Where the dead drifted, I could see a bird<br> Like a grey gull upon the breast of each.<br> While I was looking they rose hurriedly,<br> And after circling with strange cries awhile<br> Flew westward; and many a time since then<br> I've heard a rustling overhead in the wind.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>I saw them on that night as well as you.<br> But when I had eaten and drunk myself asleep<br> My courage came again.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>                           But that's not all.<br> The other night, while he was playing it,<br> A beautiful young man and girl came up<br> In a white, breaking wave; they had the look<br> Of those that are alive for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>I saw them, too, one night. Forgael was playing,<br> And they were listening there beyond the sail.<br> He could not see them, but I held out my hands<br> To grasp the woman.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p align="right">You have dared to touch her?</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>O, she was but a shadow, and slipped from me.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>But were you not afraid?</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p align="right">Why should I fear?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>’Twas Aengus and Edain, the wandering lovers,<br> To whom all lovers pray.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>                            But what of that?<br> A shadow does not carry sword or spear.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>My mother told me that there is not one<br> Of the Ever-living half so dangerous<br> As that wild Aengus. Long before her day<br> He carried Edain off from a king's house,<br> And hid her among fruits of jewel-stone<br> And in a tower of glass, and from that day<br> Has hated every man that's not in love,<br> And has been dangerous to him.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>                                  I have heard<br> He does not hate seafarers as he hates<br> Peaceable men that shut the wind away,<br> And keep to the one weary marriage-bed.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>I think that he has Forgael in his net,<br> And drags him through the sea.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>                           Well, net or none,<br> I'd drown him while we have the chance to do it.</p>  
 <p align="center">SECOND SAILOR</p>  
 <p>It's certain I'd sleep easier o' nights<br> If he were dead; but who will be our captain,<br> Judge of the stars, and find a course for us?</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>I've thought of that. We must have Aibric with us,<br> For he can judge the stars as well as Forgael.<br>                         [<i>Going towards</i> AIBRIC.<br> Become our captain, Aibric. I am resolved<br> To make an end of Forgael while he sleeps.<br> There's not a man but will be glad of it<br> When it is over, nor one to grumble at us.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>You have taken pay and made your bargain for it.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p>What good is there in this hard way of living,<br> Unless we drain more flagons in a year <a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a><br> And kiss more lips than lasting peaceable men<br> In their long lives? Will you be of our troop<br> And take the captain's share of everything<br> And bring us into populous seas again?</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>Be of your troop! Aibric be one of you<br> And Forgael in the other scale! kill Forgael,<br> And he my master from my childhood up!<br> If you will draw that sword out of its scabbard<br> I'll give my answer.</p>  
 <p align="center">FIRST SAILOR</p>  
 <p align="right">You have awaked him.<br> [<i>To</i> SECOND SAILOR.<br> We'd better go, for we have lost this chance.<br> [<i>They go out</i>.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>Have the birds passed us? I could hear your voice.<br> But there were others.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p align="right">I have seen nothing pass.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 106</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>You're certain of it? I never wake from sleep<br> But that I am afraid they may have passed,<br> For they're my only pilots. If I lost them<br> Straying too far into the north or south,<br> I'd never come upon the happiness<br> That has been promised me. I have not seen them<br> These many days; and yet there must be many<br> Dying at every moment in the world,<br> And flying towards their peace.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>                       Put by these thoughts,<br> And listen to me for awhile. The sailors<br> Are plotting for your death.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>                            Have I not given<br> More riches than they ever hoped to find?<br> And now they will not follow, while I seek<br> The only riches that have hit my fancy.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>What riches can you find in this waste sea<br> Where no ship sails, where nothing that's alive <a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a><br> Has ever come but those man-headed birds,<br> Knowing it for the world's end?</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>                        Where the world ends<br> The mind is made unchanging, for it finds<br> Miracle, ecstasy, the impossible hope,<br> The flagstone under all, the fire of fires,<br> The roots of the world.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>                     Who knows that shadows<br> May not have driven you mad for their own sport?</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>Do you, too, doubt me? Have you joined their plot?</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>No, no, do not say that. You know right well<br> That I will never lift a hand against you.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>Why should you be more faithful than the rest,<br> Being as doubtful?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>                      I have called you master<br> Too many years to lift a hand against you.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>Maybe it is but natural to doubt me.<br> You've never known, I'd lay a wager on it,<br> A melancholy that a cup of wine,<br> A lucky battle, or a woman's kiss<br> Could not amend.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p align="right">I have good spirits enough.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>If you will give me all your mind awhile--<br> All, all, the very bottom of the bowl--<br> I'll show you that I am made differently,<br> That nothing can amend it but these waters,<br> Where I am rid of life--the events of the world--<br> What do you call it?--that old promise-breaker,<br> The cozening fortune-teller that comes whispering,<br> "You will have all you have wished for when you have earned<br> Land for your children or money in a pot." <a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a><br> And when we have it we are no happier,<br> Because of that old draught under the door,<br> Or creaky shoes. And at the end of all<br> How are we better off than Seaghan the fool,<br> That never did a hand's turn? Aibric! Aibric!<br> We have fallen in the dreams the Ever-living<br> Breathe on the burnished mirror of the world,<br> And then smooth out with ivory hands and sigh,<br> And find their laughter sweeter to the taste<br> For that brief sighing.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p align="right">If you had loved some woman--</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>You say that also? You have heard the voices,<br> For that is what they say--all, all the shadows--<br> Aengus and Edain, those passionate wanderers,<br> And all the others; but it must be love<br> As they have known it. Now the secret's out;<br> For it is love that I am seeking for, <a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 110</font></a><br> But of a beautiful, unheard-of kind<br> That is not in the world.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>                           And yet the world<br> Has beautiful women to please every man.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>But he that gets their love after the fashion<br> Loves in brief longing and deceiving hope<br> And bodily tenderness, and finds that even<br> The bed of love, that in the imagination<br> Had seemed to be the giver of all peace,<br> Is no more than a wine-cup in the tasting,<br> And as soon finished.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>                           All that ever loved<br> Have loved that way--there is no other way.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>Yet never have two lovers kissed but they<br> Believed there was some other near at hand,<br> And almost wept because they could not find it.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>When they have twenty years; in middle life<br> They take a kiss for what a kiss is worth,<br> And let the dream go by.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>                              It's not a dream,<br> But the reality that makes our passion<br> As a lamp shadow--no--no lamp, the sun.<br> What the world's million lips are thirsting for,<br> Must be substantial somewhere.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>I have heard the Druids<br> Mutter such things as they awake from trance.<br> It may be that the Ever-living know it--<br> No mortal can.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p align="right">Yes; if they give us help.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>They are besotting you as they besot<br> The crazy herdsman that will tell his fellows<br> That he has been all night upon the hills,<br> Riding to hurley, or in the battle-host<br> With the Ever-living.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>                  What if he speak the truth,<br> And for a dozen hours have been a part<br> Of that more powerful life?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>                      His wife knows better.<br> Has she not seen him lying like a log,<br> Or fumbling in a dream about the house?<br> And if she hear him mutter of wild riders,<br> She knows that it was but the cart-horse coughing<br> That set him to the fancy.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>                            All would be well<br> Could we but give us wholly to the dreams,<br> And get into their world that to the sense<br> Is shadow, and not linger wretchedly<br> Among substantial things; for it is dreams<br> That lift us to the flowing, changing world<br> That the heart longs for. What is love itself,<br> Even though it be the lightest of light love,<br> But dreams that hurry from beyond the world<br> To make low laughter more than meat and drink,<br> Though it but set us sighing? Fellow-wanderer,<br> Could we but mix ourselves into a dream,<br> Not in its image on the mirror!</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>                                   While<br> We're in the body that's impossible,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>And yet I cannot think they're leading me<br> To death; for they that promised to me love<br> As those that can outlive the moon have known it,<br> Had the world's total life gathered up, it seemed,<br> Into their shining limbs--I've had great teachers.<br> Aengus and Edain ran up out of the wave--<br> You'd never doubt that it was life they promised<br> Had you looked on them face to face as I did,<br> With so red lips, and running on such feet,<br> And having such wide-open, shining eyes.</p>  
 <p align="center">AIBRIC</p>  
 <p>It's certain they are leading you to death.<br> None but the dead, or those that never lived,<br> Can know that ecstasy. Forgael! Forgael!<br> They have made you follow the man-headed birds,<br> And you have told me that their journey lies<br> Towards the country of the dead.</p>  
 <p align="center">FORGAEL</p>  
 <p>                                   What matter<br> If I am going to my death, for there,<br> Or somewhere, I shall find the love they<br> have promised. <a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a><br> That much is certain. I shall find a woman,<br> One of the Ever-living, as I think--<br> One of the Laughing People--and she and I<br> Shall light upon a place in the world's core,<br> Where passion grows to be a changeless thing,<br> Like charmed apples made of chrysoprase,<br> Or chrysoberyl, or beryl, or chrysolite;<br> And there, in juggleries of sight and sense,<br> Become one movement, energy, delight,<br> Until the overburthened moon is dead.</p>  
 <p align="center">[<i>A number of </i>SAILORS<i> enter hurriedly</i>.]</p>

The world drifts away,<br> And I am left alone with my beloved,<br> Who cannot put me from his sight for ever.<br> We are alone for ever, and I laugh,<br> Forgael, because you cannot put me from you.<br> The mist has covered the heavens, and you and I<br> Shall be alone for ever. We two--this crown--<br> I half remember. It has been in my dreams.<a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a><br> Bend lower, O king, that I may crown you with it.<br> O flower of the branch, O bird among the leaves,<br> O silver fish that my two hands have taken<br> Out of the running stream, O morning star,<br> Trembling in the blue heavens like a white fawn<br> Upon the misty border of the wood,<br> Bend lower, that I may cover you with my hair,<br> For we will gaze upon this world no longer.</p>

 <p>Beloved, having dragged the net about us,<br> And knitted mesh to mesh, we grow immortal;<br> And that old harp awakens of itself<br> To cry aloud to the grey birds, and dreams,<br> That have had dreams for father, live in us.</p>
