 <p align="center">1</p>  
 <p>Now that we're almost settled in our house<br> I'll name the friends that cannot sup with us<br> Beside a fire of turf in th’ ancient tower,<br> And having talked to some late hour<br> Climb up the narrow winding stair to bed:<br> Discoverers of forgotten truth<br> Or mere companions of my youth,<br> All, all are in my thoughts to-night being dead.</p>  
 <p align="center">2</p>  
 <p>Always we'd have the new friend meet the old<br> And we are hurt if either friend seem cold,<br> And there is salt to lengthen out the smart<br> In the affections of our heart,<br> And quarrels are blown up upon that head;<br> But not a friend that I would bring<br> This night can set us quarrelling,<br> For all that come into my mind are dead.</p>

 <p>Lionel Johnson comes the first to mind,<br> That loved his learning better than mankind,<br> Though courteous to the worst; much falling he<br> Brooded upon sanctity<br> Till all his Greek and Latin learning seemed<br> A long blast upon the horn that brought<br> A little nearer to his thought<br> A measureless consummation that he dreamed.</p>  
 <p align="center">4</p>  
 <p>And that enquiring man John Synge comes next<br> That dying chose the living world for text<br> And never could have rested in the tomb<br> But that, long travelling, he had come<br> Towards nightfall upon certain set apart<br> In a most desolate stony place,<br> Towards nightfall upon a race<br> Passionate and simple like his heart.</p>  
 <p align="center">5</p>  
 <p>And then I think of old George Pollexfen,<br> In muscular youth well known to Mayo men <a name="page_241"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 241</font></a><br> For horsemanship at meets or at racecourses,<br> That could have shown how purebred horses<br> And solid men, for all their passion, live<br> But as the outrageous stars incline<br> By opposition, square and trine;<br> Having grown sluggish and contemplative.</p>  
 <p align="center">6</p>  
 <p>They were my close companions many a year,<br> A portion of my mind and life, as it were,<br> And now their breathless faces seem to look<br> Out of some old picture-book;<br> I am accustomed to their lack of breath,<br> But not that my dear friend's dear son,<br> Our Sidney and our perfect man,<br> Could share in that discourtesy of death.</p>  
 <p align="center">7</p>  
 <p>For all things the delighted eye now sees<br> Were loved by him; the old storm-broken trees<br> That cast their shadows upon road and bridge;<br> The tower set on the stream's edge;<br> The ford where drinking cattle make a stir<br> Nightly, and startled by that sound <a name="page_242"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 242</font></a><br> The water-hen must change her ground;<br> He might have been your heartiest welcomer.</p>  
 <p align="center">8</p>  
 <p>When with the Galway foxhounds he would ride<br> From Castle Taylor to the Roxborough side<br> Or Esserkelly plain, few kept his pace;<br> At Mooneen he had leaped a place<br> So perilous that half the astonished meet<br> Had shut their eyes, and where was it<br> He rode a race without a bit?<br> And yet his mind outran the horses' feet.</p>  
 <p align="center">9</p>  
 <p>We dreamed that a great painter had been born<br> To cold Clare rock and Galway rock and thorn,<br> To that stern colour and that delicate line<br> That are our secret discipline<br> Wherein the gazing heart doubles her might.<br> Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,<br> And yet he had the intensity<br> To have published all to be a world's delight.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_243"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 243</font></a></p>

 <p>What other could so well have counselled us<br> In all lovely intricacies of a house<br> As he that practised or that understood<br> All work in metal or in wood,<br> In moulded plaster or in carven stone?<br> Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,<br> And all he did done perfectly<br> As though he had but that one trade alone.</p>  
 <p align="center">11</p>  
 <p>Some burn damp fagots, others may consume<br> The entire combustible world in one small room<br> As though dried straw, and if we turn about<br> The bare chimney is gone black out<br> Because the work had finished in that flare.<br> Soldier, scholar, horseman, he,<br> As ’twere all life's epitome.<br> What made us dream that he could comb grey hair?</p>  
 <p align="center">12</p>  
 <p>I had thought, seeing how bitter is that wind<br> That shakes the shutter, to have brought to mind <a name="page_244"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 244</font></a><br> All those that manhood tried, or childhood loved<br> Or boyish intellect approved,<br> With some appropriate commentary on each;<br> Until imagination brought<br> A fitter welcome; but a thought<br> Of that late death took all my heart for speech.</p>
