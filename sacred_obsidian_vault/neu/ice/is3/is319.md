 <p>B.     --- EXTRACTS FROM THE NJAL'S SAGA.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>To Ch. 13.  Earl Sigurd and Brian's Battle.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>84.  Now it must be told how Njal's sons, Grim and Helgi, left Iceland
 the same summer that Thrain and his fellows went abroad;  and were aboard
 ship with Olaf Kettle's son of Elda, and Bard.  They got so strong a wind
 from the north that then they were driven south into the main;  and so
 thick a mist drove over them that they could not tell whither they were going,
 and they were out a long while.  Then they came to where was a great
 ground-sea, and thought they must be near land.  Njal's sons asked if Bard
 could tell at all to what lands they were likely to be nearest. 
 "Many lands there are," said he, "after the set of wind that we
 have had, the Orkneys, or Scotland, or Ireland."  Two nights after
 they saw land on both boards, and a great surf running up in the firth. 
 They cast anchor outside the breakers.  Then the wind began to fall; 
 and next morning it was clear.  Then they see thirteen ships coming out
 towards them.  Then Bard spoke and said, "What counsel shall we take
 now, for these men must be going to make an onslaught on us?"  So
 they took counsel whether they should defend themselves or yield, but before
 they could make up their minds the vikings were upon them.  Then each side
 asked the other their names, and what their leaders were called.  Then the
 leaders of the chapmen told their names, and asked back who might lead that
 host.  One called himself Gritgard, and the other Snowcolf, sons of Moldan
 of Duncansby in Scotland, kinsmen of Malcolm the Scot king.  "And
 now," says Gritgard, "we have laid down two choices, one that ye go
 on shore, and we will take your goods;  the other is, that we fall on you
 and slay every man that we catch."  "The will of the
 chapmen," sais Helgi, "is to defend themselves."  Then the
 chapmen called out, "Wretch that thou art to speak thus!  What
 defence can we make?  Lading is less than life."  Grim, he fell
 upon a plan to shout out to the vikings, and would not let them hear the bad
 grumbling of the chapmen.  Bard and Olaf said, "Think ye not that
 these Icelanders will make game of your bad manners;  take rather your
 weapons and guard your goods."  Then they all seized their weapons
 and bound themselves, one with another, never to give up so long as they had
 strength to fight.</p>
 
 <p>85.  Then the vikings shot at them and the fight began, and the chapmen
 guard themselves well.  Snowcolf sprang at Olaf, and thrust his spear
 through his body, but Grim thrust at Snowcolf with his spear, and so stoutly,
 that he fell overboard.  Then Helgi turned to meet Grim, and they drove down
 all the vikings, and Njal's sons were ever where there was most need.  The
 vikings called out to the chapmen and bade them give up, but they say they
 would never yield.  Just then some one looked seaward, and there they see
 ships coming from the south round the Ness, and they were not fewer than
 ten.  They row hard and steer thitherwards.  Along their sides were
 shield on shield, but on that ship that came first stood a man by the mast, who
 was clad in a silken jacket, and had a gilded helm, and his hair was both fair
 and thick;  that man had a spear inlaid with gold in his hand.  He
 asked "who have here such an uneven game?"  Helgi tells his
 name, and said that against them are Gritgard and Snowcolf.  "But who
 are your captains?"  he asks.  Helgi answered, "Bard the
 black, who lives, but the other who is dead and gone, was called
 Olaf."  "Are ye two men from Iceland?"  says he. 
 "Sure enough we are," Helgi answers.  He asked whose sons they
 were.  They told him, then he knew them and said, "Well known names
 have ye all, father and sons both."  "Who art thou?" says
 Helgi.  "My name is Kari, and I am Solmund's son." 
 "Whence comest thou?"  says Helgi.  "From the Southern
 isles."  "Then thou art welcome," says Helgi, "if thou
 wilt give us a little help."  "I'll give ye all the help ye
 need," says Kari;  "but what do ye ask?"  "To
 fall on them," says Helgi.  Kari says that so it shall be.  So
 they pulled up to them, and then the battle began the second time;  but
 when they had fought a while, Kari springs up on Snowcolf's ship;  he
 turns to meet him and smites at him with his sword.  Kari leaps nimbly
 backwards over a beam that lay athwart the ship.  Snowcolf smote the beam
 so that both edges of the sword were hidden.  Kari smites at him, and the
 sword fell on his shoulder, and the stroke was so mighty that he cleft in twain
 shoulder, arm, and all, and Snowcolf got his death there and then. 
 Gritgard hurled a spear at Kari.  Kari saw it and sprang up aloft, and the
 spear missed him.  Just then Helgi and Grim had come up both to meet Kari,
 and Helgi springs on Gritgard and thrusts his spear through him, and that was
 his deathblow;  after that they went round all the ships on both
 boards.  Then men begged for peace.  So they gave them all peace, but
 took all their goods.  After that they ran all the ships out under the
 islands.</p>
 
 <p>86.  Sigurd was the name of an earl who ruled over the Orkneys; 
 he was the son of Hlodver, the son of Thorfinn the scull-splitter, the son of Turf-Einar,
 the son of Rognvald, earl of Mœren, the son of Eystein the noisy.  Kari
 was one of earl Sigurd's bodyguard, and had taken scatts in the Southern isles
 from earl Gilli.  Now Kari asks them to go to Hrossey, and said the earl
 would take to them well.  They agreed to that, and went with Kari and came
 to Hrossey.  Kari led them to see the earl, and said what men they
 were.  "How come they," says the earl, "to fall upon
 thee?"  "I found them," says Kari, "in Scotland's
 firths, and they were fighting with the sons of earl Moldan, and held their own
 so well that they threw themselves about between the bulwarks, from side to
 side, and were always there where the trial was greatest, and now I ask you to
 give them quarters among your bodyguard."  "It shall be as thou
 choosest," says the earl, "thou hast already taken so much for them
 on thy hands."  Then they were there with the earl that winter, and
 were worthily treated.  Helgi was silent as the winter wore on.  The
 earl could not tell what was at the bottom of that, and asked why he was
 silent, and what was on his mind.  "Thinkest thou it not good to be
 here?"  "Good, methinks, it is here," he says. 
 "Then what art thou thinking about?" says the earl.  "Hast
 thou any realm to guard in Scotland?" says Helgi.  "So we
 think," says the earl, "but what of that?"  "The
 Scots," says Helgi, "must have taken your steward's life, and stopped
 all news bearers, that none should cross the Pentland Firth."  "Hast
 thou the second sight?" said the earl.  "That has been little
 proved," says Helgi.  "Well," says the earl,  "I
 will increase thy honour if this be so, otherwise thou shalt smart for
 it."  "Nay," says Kari, "Helgi is not that kind of
 man, and like enough his words are sooth, for his father has the second
 sight."  After that the earl sent men south to Straumey (Stroma) to
 Arnljot, his steward there, and after that Arnljot sent them across the
 Pentland firth, and they spied out there and learnt that earl Hundi and earl
 Melsnati had taken the life of Havard in Thraswick, Sigurd's brother in
 law.  Then Arnljot sends word to earl Sigurd to come south with a great
 host and drive those earls out of his realm.  As soon as the earl heard
 that, he gathered together a mighty host.</p>
 
 <p>87.  After that the earl set out with his host, and Kari went with him,
 and Njal's sons too.  They came south to Caithness.  The earl had
 these realms in Scotland --- Ross, and Moray, Sutherland, and the Dales. 
 There came to meet them men from those realms, and say that the earls were a
 short way off with a great host.  Then earl Sigurd turns with his host
 thither, and the name of that place is Duncansnip, beyond which they met. 
 And it came to a great battle between them.  The Scots had let some of
 their host go free from the main battle, and these took the earl's men in
 flank, and many men fell there till Njal's sons turned against the foe, and
 fought with them and put them to flight.  Then it came to a hard fight,
 and then Njal's sons turn back to the front by the earl's standard, and fought
 well.  Now Kari turns to meet earl Melsnati.  Melsnati hurled a spear
 at him, but Kari caught the spear and threw it back and through the earl. 
 Then earl Hundi fled, but they chased the fleers until they learnt that Malcolm
 was gathering a host together at Duncansby.  Then the earl took counsel
 with his men, and it seemed to all the best plan to turn back, and not to fight
 with such a mighty land force.  Then they turned back.  But when the
 earl came to Staumey they shared the battle spoil.  After that he went north
 to Hrossey, and Njal's sons and Kari followed him.  Then the earl made a
 great feast, and at that feast he gave Kari a good sword, and a spear inlaid
 with gold;  but he gave Helgi a gold ring and a mantle, and Grim a shield
 and sword.  After that he took Helgi and Grim into his bodyguard, and
 thanked them for their boldness.  They were with the earl that winter and
 the summer after, till Kari went sea roving.  They went with him, and
 harried far and wide that summer, and everywhere won the victory.  They
 fought against Godred, king of Man, and conquered him;  and after that
 they fared back, and had gotten much goods.  Next winter they were with
 the earl.  When the spring came Njal's sons asked leave to go to
 Norway.  The earl said they should go as they pleased, and he gave them a
 good ship and smart men.  Kari says he must come that summer to Norway
 with earl Hacon's scatts, and then they would meet;  and so it fell out
 that they gave each other their word as to that.  After that Njal's sons
 put out to sea and sailed for Norway, and made the land north near Drontheim.
 ***********</p>
 
 <p>90.   ............ After that Kari fared west across the sea to
 meet earl Sigurd, and he greeted them (Kari and Njal's sons) very well, and
 they were with the earl that winter.  But when the spring came, Kari asked
 Njal's sons to go on warfare with him, but Grim said they would do so if he
 would fare with them afterwards out to Iceland.  Kari gave his word to do
 that.  Then they fared with him a sea roving.  They harried south about
 Anglesea and all the Southern isles.  Thence they held on to Cantyre, and
 landed there, and fought with the landsmen, and got thence much goods, and so
 fared to their ships.  Thence they fared south to Wales, and harried
 there.  Then they held on for Man.  There they met Godred king of Man
 and fought with him, and got the victory, and slew Dungal the king's son. 
 There they took great spoil.  Thence they held on north to Coll, and found
 earl Gilli there, and he greeted them well, and there they stayed with him a
 while.  The earl fared with them to the Orkneys to meet earl Sigurd. 
 But next spring earl Sigurd gave away his sister Nereid to earl Gilli. 
 Then he fared back to the Southern isles.</p>
 
 <p>91.        That summer Kari and Njal's
 sons busked them for Iceland, and when they were "all-boun" they went
 to see the earl.  The earl gave them good gifts, and they parted with
 great friendship.  Now they put to sea and have a short passage, and they
 got a fine fair breeze, and made the land at Eyrar ..............</p>
