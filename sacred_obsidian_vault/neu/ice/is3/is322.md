 <p>D. ---- HELGI AND WOLF.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>(From the Flatey Book.)</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         Earl Sigurd Hlodver's son
 ruled over the Orkneys, he was a great chief.  There was a man named Wolf
 the bad, he abode in Sanday in the Orkneys, he was a great warrior and followed
 (did not belie) his name.  There was a man named Harold who abode in North
 Ronaldshay;  the name of his son was Helgi, he was a man of promise and
 fair of face.  He spoke to his father and said, "I would thou wouldst
 find me in ships, for I wish to harry in Scotland's firths, and see what comes
 of it."  He answers, "That I may well do, for that is young
 men's wont."  After that Helgi harried, and behaves well in his
 warfare;  though he were a heathen, yet then they (the heathens) were not all
 alike.  And when Helgi was away out of the Orkneys, then Wolf the bad goes
 to North Ronaldsay and meets Harold, and said, "I would like to buy thy
 lands, they fall much to my mind;  but I will give thee ready money for
 them."  Harold says he would not sell him his estates, and says he
 does not know what he should do if he had not his board and lodging
 there.  Wolf says that he thinks the next time he comes, that he (Harold)
 will have to give up what was asked.  After that they parted.  A few
 nights afterwards, came Wolf unawares, and took Harold prisoner, and says he
 thinks that things had taken such a turn now that he will lose both lands and
 life.  And after that Wolf lets him be slain.  This deed was ill
 spoken of, and when earl Sigurd heard of it, he blamed the deed.  Wolf
 came to see the earl, and told him of it.  The earl says that he likes ill
 such undertakings, "and my will is that thou payest a fitting atonement to
 his kinsfolk."  Wolf said that he should have his way in that; 
 but said, too, that much mischief had been wrought against him by Harold. 
 Now the suit was not very speedily taken up, as Helgi was not in the
 isles.  There was a man named Bard the fair, a kinsman of Wolf the bad, he
 was a man of many friends and well-behaved, and yet he was often with Wolf. 
 Once on a time Bard said to Wolf, "We two shall never be of one
 mind;  thou rushest into ill deeds, and that is far from my turn of mind,
 and so I will change my abode and go away."  Wolf answers, "That
 is only half-wise, so long as the quarrel is not settled, and Helgi Harold's
 son, is on a roving cruize."  He said he would go for all that, and
 fits him out a ship from South Rondaldsy.  And just as he is
 "boun" then Helgi sailed up to the isles, and had heard by that time
 of his father's slaying.  And now he calls on his men that they should
 slay Bard whom he said was the nearest of kin of any man to Wolf.  Bard
 busked him to fight but said he had never done him any harm;  but said he
 would not sunder himself from Wolf's kinship.  After that they fight, and
 Bard falls there, for Helgi had a great force.  And when Wolf hears this
 he gathers force to him.  But when earl Sigurd learned that he summons
 Helgi to come to him.  And when they meet the earl said, "Thou hast
 done an ill deed in return for thy wrongs, and hast not looked towards thine
 own honour with our help;  now this quarrel had been already settled, and
 thine honour cared for."  Helgi answers, "Then everything shall
 still be placed in your power;  but I knew nothing at all about that
 settlement."  The earl said, "It must be my will to bring about
 settlements between my men here in the isles."  And after that Helgi
 goes his way.  Wolf sends men against him at once with two ships, but they
 did not meet;  and Helgi had got home before to his own abode and heard that
 and says he thinks that he should have no rest in the isles.  And sold his
 lands and busked him to go away, and said that it were well that he and Wolf
 should meet if he would not abide by the earl's doom, as he plainly showed that
 he would not.  After that he turns to Wolf's abode, and he was not at
 home.  Helgi robs there, and takes away his daughter whose name was Helga,
 and said such a prize would just suit him for an atonement for his
 father.  She bade him not do that, "for my father will follow you
 stoutly up."  He said he would run the risk of that.  After that
 he fared south among the isles.  But when Wolf learns that he fares after
 him with many ships, and said he had often avenged less insults.  But when
 they met, then they fell to fighting, and Helgi was weaker in force and his
 ships were cleared, but he made a stout defence, and was wounded.  But
 when night fell, there arose a storm of wind, and he takes this device that he
 leaps overboard with Wolf's daughter;  and swam with her from the ships; 
 and so comes to land in the darkness of night, and makes for the wood; 
 and there he saw a fire, and one man by it.  Helgi asks who he may
 be.  He said he was a husbandman, "but I know all about thee, and
 thou behavedst well on thy cruizes towards us small farmers."  Helgi
 told him the whole truth about his affairs.  This husbandman's name was
 Thorfinn, and he found Helgi in all that he needed during that winter, and was
 very kind to both of them.  Helgi said he should wish to hold his wedding
 with Helga in his house.  Thorfinn said that ws quite free to him but not
 worthy enough.  But still it came about.  And so the winter slips
 away.  Then Helgi said he wished to lease land from the husbandman, and
 said he thought that one or other thing would happen, either that Wolf would
 die soon, or that he would find him out.  Now he leases the land and
 builds him a house.  After that he hears that Wolf was dead.  Helgi
 had a son by his wife Helga, and his name was Bard, he was very dutiful and good; 
 a handsome man and a proper, both in mind and body.  And when two winters
 had gone by, Helgi and his wife and son fare back to the Orkneys, and take
 their estates, both those which Wolf had owned, and those which belonged to
 Helgi after his father Harold, and now there was no lack of money.</p>
 
 <p>         And when his son, Bard, was
 twelve winters old, he wished to go away, and said he wanted to gather together
 goods for himself.  Helgi said he was still too young to travel. 
 Bard said, "We two are unlike in temper, father mine," said he,
 "and I will fare to those peoples, of whom I have been told that they
 believe in the God of Heaven himself."  Helgi said he was unlike
 Wolf, his mother's father.</p>
 
 <p>         After that he fared away
 and comes to the house of a husbandman very far off, and said he wished to work
 for him.  The farmer said he would like that well;  he looked after
 the cattle and worked all alone;  but the farmer was very rich.  The
 lad was lightly clad, but still he did his business well;  and the farmer
 said he would give him a cow for his wages, and Bard said he was willing to
 take it, and now he drives the cow into the wood one day, and in the wood he
 met a beggarman.  This man begged Bard to give him the cow for Peter's
 thanks.  Bard answers, "Thou knowest well how to beg, and this Peter
 ought to be my friend, but for all that I will give him the cow." 
 Bard came again to the husbandman and worked for him, and it fared still better
 during that year with the husbandman's cattle, and then he gave him yet another
 cow.  Now it fared the same way as before, the beggarman came with the
 same story and begged for the cow for Peter's sake, but Bard gave him the
 cow.  The husbandman asked what had become of the kine.  Bard said
 that those had them who needed them.  With this the husbandman Bard stayed
 the third winter, and still tended his cattle, and then there were near two
 heads for every one that he had before, and he made over a third cow to
 Bard.  That self-same day came the beggarman to him in the wood, and said
 he would still wish to beg for this cow in Peter's name.  He granted him
 that at once and gave him the cow.  Then this man said to Bard, "Now
 will I pass my hands over thee."  And so it was, and it seemed to him
 as though numbness passed out of every one of his bones.  After that he
 said, "Thou shalt be a man of luck," and then he set a book on his
 shoulders, and then Bard saw far and wide over many lands.  Then the
 beggarman said, "Thinkest thou that thou art now repaid for the kine?" 
 "Of a surety (I think) so,"  said Bard.  After that he saw
 over all Ireland.  Then the newly come man said, "Thinkest thou
 thyself then repaid for the kine if thou hast power given thee as wide as thou
 now seest."  Bard said so it would be.  "Here then,"
 said he, "is now come Peter the Apostle;"  and he gave him then
 plenary powers, and so will I repay thee for the kine, that we shall never be
 parted."  After that Bard sought the husbandman, and told him this
 event.  The husbandman hardly knew him, he was so bright and lucky-looking,
 and bade him take of his goods whatsoever he would.  He bade the
 husbandman to hew him out a cell in a rock.  And so it was done. 
 Then he was baptized;  but he sat him afterwards in the same rock, and
 came to very great glory.  After some years had passed he became a bishop
 in Ireland, and the greatest chief.  There came to him his father and his
 mother, his brothers and sisters, and he enriched them all with many good
 things.  All-ruling God rewarded him as he rewards all for his lowly mindedness. 
 As he himself bears witness that whoseover abaseth himself in the eyes of his
 maker him shall he himself exalt.  The father and mother of Bard fared
 back to the Orkneys, and regained all their estates, and dwelt there till old
 age.  And here ends this story.</p>
