 <p align="center"> </p>
 
 <p>1.      There was a king named Fornjot, he ruled
 over those lands which are called Finland and Kvenland;  that is to the
 east of that bight of the sea which goes northward to meet Gandvik;  that
 we call the Helsingbight.  Fornjot had three sons;  one was named
 Hler, whom we call Ægir, the second Logi, the third Kari;  he was the
 father of Frost, the father of Snow the old, his sons name was Thorri; 
 he (Thorri) had two sons, one was named Norr and the other Gorr;  his
 daughters name was Goi.  Thorri was a great sacrificer, he had a
 sacrifice every year at midwinter;  that they called Thorris
 sacrifice;  from that the month took its name.  One winter there were
 these tidings at Thorris sacrifice, that Goi was lost and gone, and they set
 out to search for her, but she was not found.  And when that month passed
 away Thorri made them take to sacrifice, and sacrifice for this, that they
 might know surely where Goi was hidden away.  That they called Gois
 sacrifice, but for all that they could hear nothing of her.  Four winters
 after those brothers vowed a vow that they would search for her;  and so
 share the search between them, that Norr should search on land, but Gorr should
 search the outscars and islands, and he went on board ship.  Each of those
 brothers had many men with him.  Gorr held on with his ships out along the
 sea-bight, and so into Allands (1) sea;  after that he views the Swedish
 scars far and wide, and all the isles that lie in the East salt sea; 
 after that to the Gothland scars, and thence to Denmark, and views there all
 the isles;  he found there his kinsmen, they who were come from Hler the
 old out of Hlers isle, (2) and he held on then still with his voyage and hears
 nothing of his sister.  But Norr his brother bided till snow lay on the
 heaths, and it was good going on snow-shoon.  After that he fared forth
 from Kvenland and inside the sea-bight, and they came thither where those men
 were who are called Lapps, that is at the back of Finmark.  But the Lapps
 wished to forbid them a passage, and there arose a battle;  and that might
 and magic followed Norr and his men;  that their foes became as swine (3)
 as soon as they heard the war-cry and saw weapons drawn, and the Lapps betook
 themselves to flight.  But Norr fared thence west on the Keel, (4) and was
 long out, so that they knew nothing of men, and shot beasts and birds for meat
 for themselves;  they fared on till they came where the waters turned to
 the westward from the fells.  Then they fared along with the waters, and
 came to a sea;  there before them was a firth as big as it were a
 sea-bight;  there was a mickle tilths, and great dales came down to the
 firth.  There was a gathering of folk against them, and they straightway
 made ready to battle with Norr, and their quarrel fared as was to be looked
 for.  All that folk either fell or fled, but Norr and his men overcame
 them as weeds over cornfields.  Norr fared round all the firth and laid it
 under him, and made himself king over those districts that lay there inside the
 firth.  Norr tarried there the summer over till it snowed upon the
 hearths;  then he shaped his course up along the dale which goes south
 from the firth;  that firth is now called Drontheim.  Some of his men
 he lets fare the coast way round Mæren;  he laid under him all
 withersoever he came.  And when he comes south over the fell that lay to
 the south of the dalebight, he went on still south along the dales, until he
 came to a great water which they called Mjösen.  Then he turns west again
 on to the fell, because it had been told him that his men had come off worsted
 before that king whose name was Sokni.  Then they came into that district
 which they called Valders.  Thence they fared to the sea, and came into a
 long firth and a narrow, which is now called Sogn;  there was their
 meeting with Sokni, and they had there a mickle battle, because their
 witchcraft had no hold on Sokni.  Norr went hard forward, and he and Sokni
 came to handstrokes.  There fell Sokni and many of his folk.</p>
 
 <p>2.      After that Norr fared on into the firth
 that goes north from Sogn.  There Sokni had ruled before in what is now
 called Soknis dale.  There Norr tarried a long time, and that is now
 called Norafirth.  There came to meet him Gorr his brother, and neither of
 them had then heard anything of Goi.  Gorr too had laid under him all the
 outer land as he had fared from the south, and then those brothers shared the
 lands between them.  Norr had all the mainland, but Gorr shall have all
 those isles between which and the mainland he passes in a ship with a fixed
 rudder.  And after that Norr fares to the Uplands, and came to what is now
 called Heidmörk (5);  there that king ruled whose name was Hrolf of the
 Hill;  he was the son of Svadi the giant from north of the
 Dovrefell.  Hrolf had taken away from Kvenland Goi, Thorris
 daughter;  he went at once to meet Norr, and offered him single
 combat;  they fought long together and neither was wounded.  After
 that they made their quarrel up, and Norr got Hrolfs sister, but Hrolf got Goi
 to wife.  Thence Norr turned back to the realm which he had laid under
 him, that he called Norway;  he ruled that realm while he lived, and his
 sons after him, and they shared the land amongst them, and so the realms began
 to get smaller and smaller as the kings got more and more numerous, and so they
 were divided into provinces.</p>
 
 <p>3.      Gorr had the isles, and for that he was
 called a sea-king;  his sons were they Heiti and Beiti, they were
 sea-kings and mighty overbearing men.  They made many inroads on the realm
 of Norrs sons, and they had many battles, and now one, now the other won the
 day.  Beiti ran into Drontheim and warred there;  he lay where it is
 now called Beitsea and Beitstede;  thence he made them drag his ship from
 the innermost bight of Beitstede, and so north over Elduneck, that is where the
 Naumdales come down from the north.  He sat himself on the poop and held
 the tiller in his hand, and claimed for his own all that land that then lay on
 the larboard, and that is many tilths and much land.  Heiti, Gorrs son,
 was father of Sveiði the sea-king, the father of Halfdan the old, the father of
 Ivar the Uplanders earl, the father of Eystein the noisy, the father of earl
 Rognvald the mighty and the wise in council. (6)</p>
 
 <p>4.      Earl Rognvald joined Harold fair-hair when
 he seized the land, but he (Harold) gave him lordship over both the Mæren and
 Romsdale; (7) he had to wife Ragnhilda the daughter of Hrolf nosy;  their
 son was Hrolf who won Normandy, he was so tall that horses could not carry
 him;  for that he was called Ganging-Hrolf;  from him are come the
 Rouen Jarls and the English Kings;  their son was also Ivar, and Thorir
 the silent.  Rognvald had also base-born sons, their names were Hallad and
 Hrollaug and Einar, he was the youngest.  Harold fair-hair fared one
 summer west across the sea to chastise the Vikings, when he was weary at the
 peacelessness of those who harried in Norway in summer, but were in the winter
 in Shetland or the Orkneys.  He laid under him Shetland and the Orkneys
 and the Southern Isles;  he fared west too as far as Man, and laid waste
 the tilths of Man.  He had there many battles, and took as his own lands
 so far west that no king of Norway has ever owned land further west
 since.  And in one battle, Ivar, son of earl Rögnvald, fell.  But
 when king Harold sailed from the west, then he gave to earl Rognvald, as an
 atonement for his son, Shetland and the Orkneys;  but earl Rognvald gave both
 lands to Sigurd his brother:  he was one of king Harolds forecastle
 men.  The king gave Sigurd the title of earl when he went from the west,
 and Sigurd stayed behind there in the west.</p>
 
 <p>5.      Earl Sigurd made himself a mighty
 chief;  he joined his fellowship with Thorstein the red, son of Olaf the
 white and Aud the deep-minded, (8) and they won all Caithness and much else of
 Scotland, Moray and Ross;  there he caused to be built a burg southward of
 Moray.  These two agreed between themselves to meet, Sigurd and Melbricta
 toothy the Scot-earl, that they should meet and settle their quarrel at a given
 place, each with forty men.  And when the day named came, Sigurd thought
 to himself that the Scots were faithless.  He made them mount eighty men
 on forty horses;  and when Melbricta got to see them, he said to his
 men:  “Now are we cheated by Sigurd, for I see two feet of a man on each
 horses side, and the men must be twice as many again as the steeds that bear
 them.  Let us now harden our hearts, and let us see that each has a man
 for himself ere we die;”  and they got ready after that.  And when
 Sigurd saw their plan, he said to his men:  “Now half of our force shall
 get off horseback and come on them in flank when the battle is joined;  but
 we will ride at them as hard as we can, and break in sunder their array.” 
 And so they met and there was a hard battle, and not long ere Melbricta fell
 and his followers, and Sigurd caused the heads to be fastened to his horses
 cruppers as a glory for himself.  And then they rode home, and boasted of
 their victory.  And when they were come on the way, then Sigurd wished to
 spur the horse with his foot, and he struck his calf against the tooth which
 stuck out of Melbrictas head and grazed it;  and in that wound sprung up
 pain and swelling, and that led him to his death.  And Sigurd the mighty
 is buried under a “how” at Ekkjalsbakka. (9)  Guttorm was the name of
 Sigurds son;  he ruled the lands one winter and died childless.  And
 when earl Rognvald of Mæren learnt the death of that father and son, he sent
 his son Hallad west, and king Harold gave him the title of earl.  And when
 Hallad came west, he sate down in Hrossey, but Vikings went about the isles and
 over in Caithness;  they slew and robbed men.  But when the yeomen
 brought their scathe before earl Hallad, then he thought it hard to right their
 lot, and he grew weary of the dignity;  he turned himself out of the
 earldom, and took up his freehold right, and went back to Norway;  and his
 journey was thought the greatest mark for mockery.</p>
 
 <p>6.      Two Dansk Vikings set themselves down in
 the lands;  the name of the one was Thorir tree-beard, but the others
 Kalf Skurvy;  and when earl Rognvald learnt this, he took it very ill to
 heart, and fetched before him his sons Thorir and Hrollaug.  Hrolf was
 then out warring.  Rögnvald asked which of them would go west into the
 isles.  Thorir bade him see about his passage.  “So says my mind
 about this,” says the earl, “that thy thriving will be most here, and thy ways
 lie not hence.”  Then Hrollaug asked, “Wilt thou that I go?”  The
 earl says, “Not for thee will the earldom be destined, and the spirits that
 follow thee lie towards Iceland;  there wilt thou increase thy race and be
 a famous man in that land."” Then Einar went forward, the youngest of his
 sons, and said, “Wilt thou that I go to the isles?  I will promise that I
 will never come back into thy eyesight;  besides I have here little good
 to part from, and it is not to be looked for that my thriving will be less
 anywhere else than here.”  The earl says, “Unlikely art thou for a chief
 for thy mothers sake, for she is thrall born on all sides, but true it is that
 I should think it all the better that thou goest soon away and comest late
 back.”  Rögnvaldr gave Einar a ship of twenty benches fully maned, but
 king Harold gave him the title of earl.</p>
 
 <p>7.      Einar sailed west to Shetland, and there
 folk gathered to him;  after that he went south into the Orkneys, and held
 on at once to meet Kalf and his companion.  There a battle arose, and both
 those Vikings fell.  Then this stave was sung:  “He gave Treebeard to
 Trolls.  Turf-Einar slew Skurvy.”  After that he laid the lands under
 him, and made himself the greatest chief.  He first of men found out how
 to cut turf out of the earth for firewood on Turfness in Scotland, for they
 were ill off for wood in the isles.  Einar was a tall man and ugly,
 one-eyed, and yet the sharpest-sighted of men.</p>
 
 <p>8.      When the sons of Harold fair-hair had grown
 to mans estate, they became most overbearing men and unruly within the
 land;  they fell on the kings earls, some they slew, but some they drove
 from their owndoms.  Snowfrids sons, Halfdan long-leg, and Gudred the
 bright, fell on earl Rognvald of Mæren, and slew him, and took to themselves
 his realm.  But when king Harold heard that, he grew very wrath, and went
 out against his sons.  Halfdan rushed on ship-board and sailed west across
 the sea, but Gudred gave himself up to his fathers power.  King Harold
 gave Thorir as an atonement for his father, Alofa harvest-heal his daughter,
 and the title of earl, and all that his father left behind him.  Halfdan
 long-leg came into the Orkneys, and as soon as it was known that a son of king
 Harold was come thither, then men became full of fear.  Some became
 Halfdans liegemen, but earl Einar fled away out of the isles and up into
 Scotland.  Halfdan laid the isles under him, and made himself king over
 them.  Einar came back that same year, and he and Halfdan met;  there
 arose then a great battle, and Einar gained the victory, but Halfdan leapt
 overboard in the dusk at eventide.  Then Einar sang a stave:  </p>
 
 <p>“I see not from Hrolfs hand, </p>
 
 <p>Nor Hrollaugs eke, fly </p>
 
 <p>Dart on the foeman flock, </p>
 
 <p>Father-vengeance befits us;  </p>
 
 <p>But while we the battle </p>
 
 <p>This even urged on, </p>
 
 <p>Earl Thorir in Mæren </p>
 
 <p>Oer mead-cup sits mute.”</p>
 
 <p>     Next morning when it was light they went to look
 for runagate men among the isles if any had got away;  and each was slain
 on the spot as he stood.  Then earl Einar took to saying these
 words:  “I know not what I see in Rinansey, sometimes it lifts itself up,
 but sometimes it lays itself down, that is either a bird or a man, and we will
 go to it.”  There they found Halfdan long-leg, and Einar made them carve
 an eagle on his back with a sword, and cut the ribs all from the backbone, and
 draw the lungs there out, and gave him to Odin for the victory he had won (10)
 then Einar sung this:</p>
 
 <p>                 
 “Man broad-bearded oft is outlawed,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Many a one, for stealing sheep;</p>
 
 <p>                 
 But in isles here I for felling</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Mighty Harolds youthful son:</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Risk hangs oer me, say the freemen,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 From the king so courage-full,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Harolds shield Ive hewn a hole in,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 None can call that dint in doubt.”</p>
 
 <p>      And again this:</p>
 
 <p>                 
 “Ever am I glad since spears,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 ----Good tis daring deeds to do,---</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Spears of warriors fond of fight,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Bit the boy-son of the king;</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Him I hide not they mislike,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 There flew gray across the isles</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Bird that feasts on body-wounds,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Wounds of Halfdan, joy of hawks.”</p>
 
 <p>      After that he made them cast Halfdans “how,”
 and sang:</p>
 
 <p>                 
 “Wreakt I reckon Rognvalds death,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Right in this the Norns have shapen.</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Now the peoples prop hath fallen</p>
 
 <p>                 
 To my fourth share of revenge;</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Scatter stones ye lissom lads,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 For a victory we have won,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Scatt to Long-legs here I scatter,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Scatt of stones of grit so hard.”</p>
 
 <p>      And when this news was heard in Norway, then
 his brothers took it very ill, and vowed a vow to fare to the Orkneys and
 avenge him, but king Harold made them put off their voyage.  Einar sung
 when he heard of their vow:</p>
 
 <p>                 
 “For my life forsooth are many</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Eager, as I hear them say,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Mighty men of no mean race,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 From divers mansions of the earth;</p>
 
 <p>                 
 But for that they do not know,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 These, until they lay me low,</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Which of us the eagles claws</p>
 
 <p>                 
 Shall bow beneath ere all be oer.”</p>
 
 <p>      But sometime after king Harold fared west
 across the sea and came to the isles.  Einar fled away out of the isles
 and over to Caithness;  after that men came between them and they made up
 their quarrel.  King Harold laid a fine upon the isles, and bade them pay
 sixty marks of gold.  Earl Einar offered to bring out the fine alone, and
 then to own all the allodial holdings, and the freeholders were willing to do
 that;  for the wealthy thought they would be able to buy back their
 holdings, but the poor had no money to pay the fine with.  Einar paid up
 the fine, and so it was long after that the earls had all the allodial lands,
 till earl Sigurd gave back to the Orkneyingers their allodial lands.  King
 Harold fared back to Norway, but earl Einar ruled over the Orkneys a long time,
 and died of sickness.  He had three sons.  Ones name was Arnkell,
 another Erlend, a third Thorfinn skull-splitter.  When Harold the
 fair-haired breathed his last, Eric blood-axe was king two winters.</p>
 
 <p>      Then came Hacon Athelstanes foster-child
 from England, but Eric fared out of the land.  He sailed west over the
 sea, and harried in Scotland and England.  But when king Athelstane heard
 that he sent men to Eric, and offered to give him some land;  he said he
 had been a great friend of king Harold, and said that he would show that by
 honouring his son.  He said also that he would set him at one with king
 Hacon his foster son.  King Eric accepted this choice, and he gave him
 Northumberland to rule over;  that is a fifth of England.  But for
 that, Eric had little land and many men, he grew short of money.  For that
 he harried during the summers, but in the winters he sat at home on his
 lands;  he kept on doing that while king Athelstane lived.  After him
 his brother Edmund took the realm;  he was not such a friend of the
 Northmen as king Athelstane, he thought it ill that Eric should have
 Northumberland.  And one spring king Eric fared north along Scotland, and
 thence to the Orkneys, and took with him the earls of the Orkneys, the sons of
 Turf-Einar, Arnkell and Erlend.  Thence he fared to the Southern Isles,
 and there too he got a great force.  Thence he fared to Ireland and
 harried, and he did the like in Bretland (Wales).  Thence he fared to
 England, and there he harried as he had done elsewhere.  Olaf was the name
 of the king whom Edmund had set there to ward the land.  But for that Eric
 had a great force, he landed and went up away from his ships.  Olaf also
 gathered an overwhelming force and fared against king Eric, and there was a
 mighty battle.  At the beginning of the day the Englishmen fell fast, but
 where one fell three came in his stead.  But towards the close of the day
 the loss of men turned on the side of the Northmen, and the end of it was that
 king Eric fell and five kings with him.  One of them was called
 Guthrum;  there fell also the earls Arnkell and Erlend, the sons of
 Turf-Einar.  But when queen Gunnhilda and her sons were ware that Eric had
 fallen and that he had before harried the land of the king of England, they
 thought they knew that there was no hope of peace for them in England;  so
 they busked them in haste for the Orkneys.  Thorfinn Skullsplitter was
 then earl there.  Then the sons of Gunnhilda took the isles under them,
 and were there in the winters but fared a-warring in the summers.  But
 while Gunnhilda and her sons were in the Orkneys, they heard that there was
 strife between the king of the Danes and king Hacon Athelstanes foster-child. 
 Then they thought there was some hope that they might get help from Harold
 Gorms son.  Then they began their voyage to the Dane king.  But
 before they fared out of the Orkneys they gave away Ragnhilda, the daughter of
 king Eric and Gunnhilda, to Arnfinn the son of earl Thorfinn, and then Thorfinn
 took up his seat (established his rule) in the isles. (11)</p>
 
 <p>9.      Thorfinn had five sons.  The name of
 the first was Havard the harvest happy, the second was Hlodver, the third Ljot,
 the fourth Skuli, the fifth Arnfinn, Ragnhilda Erics daughter wrought her
 husband Arnfinns death at Murkle in Caithness;  but she gave herself away
 to Havard the harvest-happy, his brother.  Harvard took the earldom, and
 was a good chief;  and in his days were good harvests.  Einar
 oily-tongue was the name of a man, Harvards sisters son.  He was a great
 chief, and had a great following, and went a-warring in the summers.  He
 was guest at a feast at Havards, and at that feast they, Ragnhilda and Einar,
 talked much together.  She said such a man was well worthy to be a chief,
 and better fitted for the earldom than Havard, his kinsman;  she called,
 too, that woman well wedded who had such a husband.  Einar bade her not to
 take to such words;  said he (Harvard) was the noblest man in the isles,
 and she full well wedded.  Ragnhild answers:  “Short henceforth shall
 be my and Harvards wedded life;  true it is that there must be men in the
 isles who will not let everything grow in their eyes, even if thou puttest
 aside the honour from thee.”  With such upbraidings Einars mind turned to
 greed and guile against the earl his kinsman, and they settled it between them
 that he should slay the earl, but that she should be wedded to him.  And
 sometime after Einar busked himself to that journey, and then a spaeman spoke,
 who was with him:  “Dont do this work today, but rather tomorrow, else
 kin-killing will last long in your family.”  Einar made as though he heard
 it not.  Havard was then at Stoneness (12) in Hrossey;  there they
 met one another, and there was a hard battle, and not long ere the earl
 fell.  That place is now called Havards crofts.  And when these
 tidings were heard, Einar was thought to have been a mickle dastard for this
 deed;  then Ragnhilda would have no fellowship with him, and said it was
 all a lie that she had ever given her word.  Then she sent for Einar
 hardchaft;  he was son of another sister of Harvards;  and when they
 met, she said twas shame on such kinsmen of his who would not avenge him, and
 she said she would do anything that the earl might be avenged.  “Besides,
 too,” she said, “it is well known that he must be most honoured by all good men
 who avenges the earl, and that man, too, will have won his way to his
 realm.”  Einar answers:  “About this it is said,” he says, “that ye
 sometimes say other things than what you have in your heart, but whoso does
 this work must have for it that thou holdest in hand for him the realm and
 those other things too, which will not be thought less worth having.”  So
 they break off their speech.  After this Einar hardchaft fell on Einar
 oily-tongue, and slew him;  but Ragnhilda sent for Ljot their (Havards
 and Arnkells) brother, and wedded him.  Ljot took the earldom, and became
 a mighty chief.  Einar hardchaft had now slain his kinsman, but was no
 nearer the earldom than before.  Now he is very ill pleased with his lot,
 and would gather men to him, and seek to have the isles by main force; 
 but he was ill off for men, for the Orkneyingers would only serve the sons of
 Thorfinn skull-splitter;  and sometime after the earl let Einar hardchaft
 be slain.</p>
 
 <p>10. Skuli, Ljots brother, fared away up into Scotland, and there the title
 of earl was given him by the Scot-king.  After that he came down on
 Caithness, and gathered folk to him there;  and thence he fared into the
 isles, and there strove against his brother Ljot for the realm.  Ljot
 gathers folk, and fared to meet Skuli, and had more men on his side;  but
 when they met, Skuli would hear of nothing but fighting, so there was a hard
 battle, and Ljot won the victory;  but Skuli fled over to the Ness and up
 into Scotland, and thither Ljot fares after him, and stayed there a while, and
 had more men on his side.  And then Skuli rides down from Scotland with a
 mighty host, which the Scot-king and earl Macbeth had given him, and he and
 Ljot met in the Dales in Caithness, and there arose a mickle battle.  And
 the Scots were most hot at the beginning of the fight.  Earl Ljot bade his
 men to keep under their shields, but still to stand as fast as they
 could.  But when the Scots could do nothing, Ljot egged on his men, and
 was himself the hottest.  And when things had stood so for a while, then
 the array of those Scots was broken, and after that they fly;  but Skuli
 kept up the battle, though he fell at last.  Ljot took Caithness under
 him, and then there was strife between the King of Scots and earl Ljot, for the
 Scots were ill pleased at their bad luck.  When earl Ljot was in Caithness
 with few men, then earl Macbeth came down from Scotland with a mighty host, and
 he and Ljot met on Skidmoor in Caithness;  and earl Ljot had no great
 force against them, but still Ljot went so fast forward, that the Scots they
 yielded before him, and there was a short battle ere they fled, who chose life,
 but many were wounded.  Ljot turned back with victory, but his men were
 much wounded.  Earl Ljot also had gotten that wound which led him to his
 death, and his death was much mourned.</p>

 <p>11.  The text of this account of Eric blood-axe has been turned into
 Icelandic from the Danish Translation, aided by the Heimskringla.  In Fl.
 it is abridged thus:  “Then came Hacon Athelstanes foster-child into the
 land, but Eric fled away as is before said.  Earls Arnkell and Erlend,
 sons of Turf-Einar, fell in England with King Eric blood-axe, as is written
 before.  Gunnhilda and her sons fared afterwards to the Orkneys, and took
 them under her, and dwelt there awhile.  Then they fared to Denmark, but
 before they went gave away Ragnhilda, daughter of Eric and Gunnhilda, to Arnfinn,
 son of earl Thorfinn, and earl Thorfinn established himself in the isles.”</p>

 <p>11.  Hlodver Thorfinns son took the earldom after Ljot, and was a
 great chief;  he had to wife Edna, daughter of Kjarval, the Irish
 king;  their son was Sigurd the stout.  Hlodver died of sickness, and
 is buried under a “how” at Hofn in Caithness.  Sigurd, his son, took the
 earldom after him;  he was a great chief and wide of lands.  He held
 by main force Caithness against the Scots, and had a host out every
 summer.  He harried in the Southern Isles, in Scotland and Ireland. 
 It chanced one summer that Finnleik, the Scot-earl, staked in a battle-field
 for Sigurd on Skidmoor by a day named, but Sigurd went to ask his mothers
 counsel, for she knew many things. (1)  The earl told her that there would
 not be less odds against him than seven men for one.  She answers: 
 “I had reared thee up long in my wool-bag had I known thou wouldest like to
 live for ever;  and fate rules life, but not where a man is come;  better
 it is to die with honour than to live with shame.  Take thou here hold of
 this banner which I have made for thee with all my cunning and I ween it will
 bring victory to those before whom it is borne, but speedy death to him who
 bears it.”  The banner was made with mickle needlecraft and famous
 skill.  It was made in ravens shape;  and when the wind blew out the
 banner, then it was as though the raven spread his wings for flight.  Earl
 Sigurd was very wrath at the words of his mother, and gave the Orkneyingers
 their allodial holdings for their help, and so he fared to meet earl Finnleik
 on Skidmoor, and each drew up his host in battle array.  And when the
 battle was joined, the banner bearer of earl Sigurd was shot to death. 
 The earl bade another man go and bear the banner, and after they had fought a
 while that man fell.  So three banner bearers of the earl fell, but he had
 the victory, and then the Orkneyingers got back their allodial rights.</p>
 
 <p>12.  Olaf Tryggvis son was four years in warfare in the western lands
 since he had come from Vindland--- the land of the Wends--- ere he let himself
 be baptized in the Scilly isles.  Thence he fared to England --- read
 Ireland--- and got there to wife Gyda, the daughter of Kvaran the Irish
 king.  After that he stayed a while in Dublin until earl Hacon sent Thorir
 the whiner to lure him thence.  Olaf sailed from the west with four ships
 and came first to the Orkneys.  There he met earl Sigurd in Osmunds voe
 in South Rognvaldsey with three ships, and he was boun for warfare.  King
 Olaf let the earl be called on board his ship and said he wished to talk with
 him;  and when they met king Olaf spoke to him, “It is my will that thou
 lettest thyself be baptized and all the folk that serve thee, else thou shalt
 die here at once, but I will fare with fire and flame over all the
 isles.”  But when the earl saw into what a strait he had come he gave up
 all his suit into the kings power.  The king then let him be baptized,
 and took as a hostage his son whose name was Hound or Whelp, but the king let
 him be baptized in the name of Hlodvir.  Then all the Orkneys became
 Christian.  But king Olaf then sailed east to Norway, and Hlodvir fared
 with him, but he lived a short while.  But after that earl Sigurd yielded
 no obedience to king Olaf.  He went into a marriage with a daughter of
 Malcolm the king of the Scots, and their son was earl Thorfinn.  Earl
 Sigurd had before had three sons who were then alive, the name of one of them
 was Summerled, of the second Brusi, the third Einar. (2)</p>
 
 <p>13.  A little while after the agreement between king Olaf and earl
 Sigurd Hlodverson, the earl took to wife the daughter of Malcolm, the
 Scot-king, and their son was earl Thorfinn.  Earl Sigurd had three other
 sons, one was called Brusi, the second Summerled, the third Einar
 wry-mouth.  Five winters (3) after the battle at Svolder, earl Sigurd
 fared to Ireland, to help king Sigtrygg silk-beard, but he set up his elder
 sons over the lands, but his son Thorfin, he gave over into the hands of the Scot-king,
 his mothers father, to foster.  But when earl Sigurd came to Ireland, he
 and king Sigtrygg marched with that host to meet Brian, the Irish king, and
 their meeting was on Good Friday.  Then it fell out that there was no one
 left to bear the raven banner, and the earl bore it himself, and fell there,
 but king Sigtrygg fled.  King Brian fell with victory and glory.</p>
 
 <p>14.  After the fall of earl Sigurd, his sons took the realm and shared
 it into trithings among Summerled, Brusi, and Einar.  Thorfinn was with the
 Scot-king five winters old when his father Sigurd fell.  Then the
 Scot-king gave Thorfinn, his daughters son, Caithness and Sutherland and the
 title of earl, and set up men to rule the land with him.  Earl Thorfinn
 was early in coming to his full growth, the tallest and strongest of men; 
 his hair was black, his features sharp, and his brows scowling, and as soon as
 he grew up it was easy to see that he was forward and grasping.  Those
 brothers, Brusi and Einar, were unlike in temper.  Einar was a man stern
 and grasping, unfriendly, and a mighty man for war.  Brusi was a meek man,
 he kept his feelings well in hand and was humble, and ready-tongued. 
 Summerled was like to Brusi in temper;  he was the eldest of those
 brothers, and lived shortest, and died of sickness.  After his death earl
 Thorfinn claimed a share of the realm in the Orkneys.  Einar said that
 Thorfinn had Caithness and Sutherland, that realm which their father had owned,
 and called it more than a trithing of the isles, and would not grant Thorfinn a
 share after Summerled;  but Brusi was willing to grant it, and gave over
 the share for his part.  “I will not,” he said, “covet more of the realm
 than that trithing which I own by right.”  Then Einar took two lots of the
 isles under him;  then he made himself mighty, and had many followers, was
 oft a-warring in the summers, and had a great levy of men out of the land, but
 it was quite another story with the spoil.  Then the freemen began to be
 weary of that toil;  but the earl held boldly on with his burdens, and
 suffered no man to speak a word against him.  Einar was the most
 overbearing of men.  A great dearth arose in his realm from the toil and
 outgoings which the freemen had;  but in that lot of the land that Brusi
 had was great peace and plenty, and the freemen had an easy life;  for
 that he had many friends.</p>
 
 <p>15.  There was a powerful and wealthy man named Amund, he dwelt at
 Hrossey, at Sandwick on Lopness.  His sons name was Thorkell, the
 properest man of all men who were then growing up in the Orkneys.  Asmund
 was a wise man, and one of the men most esteemed in the islands.  It fell
 out one spring that the earl had a mighty levy, as was his wont, but the
 freemen grumbled and took it ill, and brought the matter before Amund, and bade
 him speak to the earl for a little forbearance.  Amund said the earl would
 turn a deaf ear, “and little will come of it;  as it is the earl and I are
 good friends, but methinks there is a great risk if we two should come to a
 quarrel with our tempers.  No,” says he, “I will have nothing to do with
 it.”  Then they told their story to Thorkell;  he was loath to do
 anything, but still promised them his good offices, after being egged on by the
 men.  Amund thought he had been too hasty in promising.  But when the
 earl held a Thing, then Thorkell spoke on behalf of the freemen, told the need
 of the men, and bade the earl spare his people.  Einarr answers well, and
 says he will give heed to his words:  “I had meant now to have six ships
 out of the land, but now no more than three shall go;  but as for thee,
 Thorkell, dont now ask this any more.”  The freemen thanked Thorkell well
 for his help.  The earl fared away on a Viking voyage, and came back at
 autumn.  But after that, in the spring, the earl had again a levy and held
 a Thing with the freemen.  Then Thorkell spoke again, and bade the earl
 spare the freemen.  The earl answers wrathfully, and said that the lot of
 the freemen should much worsen for his speech.  He made himself so wood
 and wrath, that he said they should not be both there another spring safe and
 sound at the Thing.  And so the Thing broke up.  But when Amund
 became ware of what had passed between the earl and Thorkell, he begged
 Thorkell to go away.  So he fared over to Caithness to earl Thorfinn, and
 was there long afterwards, and fostered him, when the earl was young, and was
 afterwards called Thorkell fosterer;  and he was a man of mark.  Many
 were the men of might who fled away out of the Orkneys for the overbearing of
 earl Einarr.  Most fled to earl Thorfinn, some to Norway and to divers
 lands.</p>
 
 <p>16.  As soon as earl Thorfinn was grown up, then he sent a message to
 Einar his brother, and asked of him that share of the realm which he thought
 belonged to him in the Orkneys, but that was a trithing.  Einar was in no
 hurry to lessen himself so.  But when earl Thorfinn hears that, then he
 calls out force from Caithness.  But when earl Einar was ware of that,
 then he gathers force, and goes against Thorfinn, and means to fight with
 him.  Earl Brusi also gathers force, goes to meet them, and brings about
 an agreement that Thorfinn should have a trithing of the realm in the Orkneys
 which he owned by right, but earl Brusi and earl Einarr laid their lots
 together.  Einar was to have the leadership over them, and the wardship of
 the land.  But if either of them died before the other, then that one of
 them who lived longer should take the lands after the other.  But that
 settlement was thought to be unfair, for Brusi had a son, whose name was
 Rognvald, but Einar was sonless.  Earl Thorfinn sets men to keep watch and
 ward over that realm which he owned in the Orkneys;  but he was most often
 in Caithness.</p>
 
 <p>17.  Earl Einar (4) was most often in the summers in warfare round
 Ireland and Scotland and Wales.  It happened one summer when he was
 warring on Ireland that he fought in Ulfreksfirth (5) with Konufogur the Irish
 king.  Earl Einar there got a mighty defeat and loss of men.  The
 next summer after Eyvind Urarhorn fared from the west from Ireland, and meant
 to steer for Norway.  The weather was sharp, and there was a great
 storm.  Then Eyvind put in to Osmunds voe, (6) and lay there weather
 bound a while.  But when earl Einar learns that, then he went thither with
 a great force, and he took there Eyvind, and made them slay him, but gave peace
 to most of his men.  They fared home to Norway about autumn, and went to
 find king Olaf, and told him how Eyvind had been taken off.  The king
 answers little about it, and yet it could be found out that he thought this a
 mickle manscathe, and wrought more against himself than any one else.  The
 king was short of words whenever he thought anything much against his
 mind.  Earl Thorfinn sent Thorkell, his fosterer, out into the isles to
 get together his scatts and tolls.  Earl Einar laid at Thorkells door
 much of that rising against him which had happened when earl Thorfinn laid his
 claim out in the isles.  Thorkell fared hastily out of the isles over to
 the Ness, and told earl Thorfinn that he had become sure of this, that earl Einar
 meant death for him, if his friends or kinsmen had not given him warning. 
 “Now I must choose one of these two things, either to let the earls and my
 meeting be so that we may settle our business once for all;  or that other
 to fare further away, and thither where the earl shall never have power over
 me.”  Earl Thorfinn was very eager that he should fare east to Norway to
 meet King Olaf.  “Thou wilt,” says the earl, “be made much of wherever
 thou art with honourable men;  but I know both your tempers, the earls
 and thine, that ye two would be but a scant time before ye came to
 blows.”  Then Thorkell busked him to go to king Olaf, and fared about
 autumn to Norway, and was with king Olaf that winter in great love;  the
 king took Thorkell much into his counsel.  He thought, as was true, that
 Thorkell was a wise and very able man.  The king found out from his talk
 that he was very uneven in his stories about the earls, and that he was a great
 friend of Thorfinn, but slow to praise earl Einar.  And early next spring
 the king sent a ship west over the sea to find earl Thorfinn, and this bidding,
 by word of mouth, that the earl should come to see him.  He did not lay
 the journey under his pillow, for words of friendship came along with the
 message.</p>
 
 <p>18.  Earl Thorfinn fared east to Norway and came to see king
 Olaf.  He got there a good welcome, and stayed there long on in the
 summer.  But when he made ready to go west, then king Olaf gave him a
 great and good longship, with all her tackling.  Thorkell fosterer made up
 his mind to go with earl Thorfinn, and the earl gave him that ship which he had
 brought from the west that summer.  The king and the earl parted the best
 of friends with great love.  Earl Thorfinn came back about autumn to the
 Orkneys.  But when earl Einar heard this, he got many men together and lay
 aboard ship.  Earl Brusi went to meet those brothers, and tried to bring
 about a settlement between them, and so it came about that they were set at one
 again, and bound that with oaths.  Thorkell fosterer was then to be taken
 into that settlement, and into friendship with earl Einar, and that was also
 said that each of them should make the other a feast, and the earl was to come
 first to pay Thorkell a visit at Sandwick.  But when the earl was there at
 the feast, he was treated in the bravest way.  The earl was not
 cheerful.  There was a mickle hall there, and doors at both ends.
  That day on which the earl was to go away, and was busking himself,
 Thorkell was to go along with him to the feast, Thorkell sent men forward to
 spy out on the road along which they were to fare that day;  but when they
 came back they told Thorkell that they found there three ambushes and men with
 weapons;  “and we think, to say thee sooth, that treachery must lie under
 this.”  But when Thorkell learned that he put off his busking and got his
 men together.  The earl bade him busk himself and said twas high time to
 ride.  Thorkell said he had much to look after.  He went sometimes
 out and sometimes in.  Fires were on the floor.  Then Thorkell went
 in at one of the doors and with him a man who is named Hallvard.  He was a
 man from Iceland, an Eastfirther by kin.  He shut the door after
 them.  Thorkell went inside along the hall between the fire and where the
 earl sate.  The earl asked, “Art thou boun now?”  Thorkell answers,
 “I am boun now.”  Then Thorkell hewed at the earl on his head.  The
 earl fell forward stooping on the floor.  Hallvard said, “Here I see the
 worst of all wrestling tricks, that ye do not draw the earl from the
 fire.”  Then he thrust an Irish axe (7) under the nape of the earls neck,
 and jerked him up on the bench.  Then both those comrades Thorkell and
 Hallvard, went out hastily, by the other doorway facing that by which they went
 in, and there outside stood Thorkells men armed to the teeth.  The earls
 men looked to him, but he was then dead, and the hands of all failed them to
 avenge him;  besides, it was all done in a hurry, for no man looked for
 such a deed from Thorkell;  for they all thought that it would be, as was
 already agreed, that there should be friendship between the earl and
 Thorkell.  Most of the men too were weaponless who were inside the hall,
 and many of them good friends of Thorkell of yore.  It happened too by
 that fate by which longer life was allotted to Thorkell.  When Thorkell
 came out he had no less force than the earls men.  Then Thorkell fared to
 his ship, but the earls men went away.  Thorkell sailed away that day
 east into the sea, and that was after the winter had begun.  Then they
 came safe and sound to Norway.  Thorkell went at once to find king Olaf,
 and he got there a good welcome:  The king showed himself well pleased at
 this deed.  Thorkell was with him that winter.</p>
 
 <p>19.  After the falling away of earl Einar, earl Brusi took that lot of the
 lands which earl Einar had before had, for it was with many mens witness on
 what terms Brusi and Einar had gone into partnership.  It seemed most
 right to earl Thorfinn that each of them should have half the isles;  but
 still Brusi had that winter both lots of the isles.  But the spring after
 Thorfinn laid claim to the land against Brusi, saying that he will have half
 the lands, but Brusi would not say yes to that;  so they summoned meetings
 about those matters.  Then their friends went about to settle the
 business, and so it came out not only that Thorfinn would let nothing else
 please him than to have half the isles;  but he says at the same time that
 Brusi, with the temper he had, had no need of more than a trithing.  “I
 grudged not,” says he (Brusi), “to have a trithing of the land which I took
 after my father as my heritage;  and no one challenged my right to that;
  but now I have taken another trithing after my brother by lawful
 agreement.  But though I am unable to strive in rivalry with you, kinsman,
 yet I will look to some one else rather than consent to give away my realm in
 such a way.”  When things had gone so far at that parley they
 parted.  But when Brusi saw that he could not stand on even feet against
 Thorfinn, for that he had a much greater realm, besides the trust that he had
 in the Scot-king, his mother's father, then he, Brusi, made up his mind to fare
 away out of the land east to find king Olaf, and he had with him his son
 Rognvald, who was then ten winters old.  But when the earl met the king,
 he gave him a good welcome.  But when the earl unfolded his errand, and
 tells the king the whole story of what had happened between his brother and
 himself, and begged the king to lend him strength to hold his realm, he offered
 him at the same time in return his entire friendship.  The king answers,
 and began first to say how Harold fair-hair had owned all the allodial land in
 the Orkneys, “but the earls have held it since in fief, but never as their
 owndom;  and that is a token,” says he, “that when Eric blood-axe and his
 sons were in the Orkneys, then the earls were bound to do them service. 
 But when Olaf, Tryggvis son, my kinsman, came there, then earl Sigurd, your
 father, made himself his man.  Now I have taken all the heritage after
 him.  Now I will make thee that choice that thou becomest my man; 
 then will I give over to thee the isles in fief;  then we two will try, if
 I lend thee my strength, whether it shall stand thee in better stead, or
 whether his trust in the Scot-king, to thy brother Thorfinn.  But if thou
 wilt not take this choice, then must I look after those rights and owndoms
 which our kinsmen have held there away west."” The earl bore these sayings
 in his mind, and laid them before his friends, and asked counsel of them to
 what he should consent, and whether he should strike a bargain with king Olaf
 on those terms and become his man.  “But it is not at all plain to me what
 my lot will be when we part, if I say nay;  for the king has made bare to
 me his claim, that he thinks he owns the isles.  But with his boldness of
 purpose, and bearing in mind this too that we have come here, it will be a
 little thing for him to do just as he pleases with our affair.”  But
 though the earl found manifest fault with both courses, whichever way he went,
 still he took that choice, to lay all in the kings power, both himself and his
 realm.  Then king Olaf took from the earl power and lordship over all his
 lands of heritage, and then the earl was made the kings man, and bound that
 with oaths.</p>
 
 <p>20. Earl Thorfinn learnt that Brusi his brother had fared east to find king
 Olaf, to seek trust from him;  but because Thorfinn had before fared to
 find king Olaf and got himself into friendship there, then he thought he had
 made it all right there beforehand, and knew that many there would back his
 cause;  so earl Thorfinn takes this counsel:  he makes ready his
 voyage as speedily as he can and fared to Norway, and thought that he should
 make the passage almost as soon as Brusi, and that his errand would not be brought
 to an end.  But when Thorfinn met the king, it was another way than he had
 thought;  for when he came to see king Olaf, all that bargain between the
 king and Brusi was made and struck.  Besides, earl Thorfinn did not know
 that Brusi had given up his realm before ever earl Thorfinn had come to see
 king Olaf.  But as soon as they met, the earl and king Olaf, then the king
 raised the same claim to the realm in the Orkneys which he had already made to
 Brusi, and bade Thorfinn do the same thing, that he should yield over to the
 king those lots of the lands which he already owned.  The earl answers
 well to the kings words, and spoke so as to show that he set great store on
 his friendship.  “And if ye, lord,” said the earl, “think that ye need my
 help against other chiefs, then ye have won it fully;  but it is not in my
 power to yield you homage, for I am already the Scot-kings earl, and bound to
 do him service.”  But when the king found that there was drawing back in
 the earls answers as to this question which he had raised, then the king
 spoke:  “If thou, earl, wilt not become my man, there is yet another
 choice, that I set that man up over the Orkneys whom I will, and my will then
 is that thou take oath to lay no claim to their lands, and to let them be in
 peace for thee whom I set up.  But if thou wilt have none of these
 choices, then it must so seem to those whom I set up, as though strife were to
 be looked for them from thee;  then mayest thou not think it wonderful
 though the dale comes to meet the hill.” (8)  The earl answers, and bade
 the king give him time to think over that matter.  The king did so, and
 gave the earl time and leave to take counsel with his friends as to this. 
 Then the earl begged the king to grant him time till the next summer, and that
 he might fare home first of all.  “All my councillors are at home,” (9) he
 says, “and I am but a child for my years sake.”  But the king bade him
 choose one of the two courses there and then.  Thorkell fosterer was then
 with the king;  he sent men stealthily to the earl, and besought him not
 to think, whatever might be on his mind, of parting so with king Olaf that they
 were not good friends, just when he had put himself in the kings hands. 
 He (Thorkell) thought he could see that the only choice left him was to let the
 king have his will in everything.  It seemed to them (Thorkell and his
 friends) though not at all a good choice to have no hope ones self of ones
 heritage, and to take an oath to the effect that they might have that realm in
 peace who were not born to it.  But because that he thought it uncertain
 about his going away, then he made that choice to give himself over into the
 kings hand, and become his man as his brother Brusi had done.  The king
 found out that Thorfinn was of a much higher spirit than Brusi, and for that
 sake he trusted Thorfinn less;  the king saw too that he would think he
 might look for strength from the Scot-king, even though he broke this
 agreement;  the king understood that out of his wisdom.  Brusi went
 unwillingly into all the agreement, but spoke nothing but what he meant to
 hold;  but where Thorfinn was he went gladly at everything;  as soon
 as ever he had made up his mind what part he should take, (then he went gladly
 into every condition) (10) and did not stickle in the least at what the king
 asked the first evening;  but the king doubted that he must mean to go
 back on some of his undertakings.</p>

 <p>21.        When king Olaf had thought
 over with himself the whole matter, he let them blow the trumpets for a great
 gathering of men, and made them call both the earls thither.  Then he
 spoke thus:  “I will now declare before the whole people the settlement
 between the Orkney earls and myself.  They have now agreed to my absolute
 right over the Orkneys and Shetland, and made themselves my men, and bound that
 with oaths, and I will now give them in fief, to Brusi one trithing and to Thorfinn
 another as they have had before;  but that trithing which earl Einar
 owned, that I make fall to me, for that sake that he slew Eyvind Urarhorn, my
 henchman and dear brother in arms.  For that lot of the lands, I will take
 care as I think good.  That, too, I lay on both ye brethren, my earls,
 that ye take an atonement from Thorkell, Amunds son, for the slaying of your
 brother Einar;  and I wish to lay down the terms of the atonement if ye
 will say yes to that.”  But it was now as it was in other things;  they
 said yes to everything the king said.  Then Thorkell went forward and
 bound himself by the king's award, and so that Thing broke up.  King Olaf
 awarded an atonement for earl Einar as though for three kings thanes, but for
 cause given a trithing of the fine was to fall to the ground.  Earl
 Thorfinn begged leave of the king to go away, but as soon as he got that he
 busked him speedily.  But when he was all-boun, it fell upon a day when
 the earl was a-drinking on his ship, that there came to him stealthily Thorkell
 Amunds son, and laid his head upon his knees, and bade him do with it as he
 would.  The earl asked why he did so, “now that we are already set at one
 by the kings doom.  Stand up, pray.”  He did so, and said, “That
 atonement which the king made between us I may trust between Brusi and
 me;  but so far as you have any share in it, you alone shall have your
 way.  Though the king has awarded me my estates and right to stay in the
 Orkneys, still I know your frame of mind so well that I can never go into the
 isles unless I fare thither on your good faith.  I will bind myself to
 you,”  he says, “never to come to the Orkneys, whatever the king may have
 said about that.”  The earl held his peace, and was slow to speak, and
 then he spoke thus:  “Wilt thou, Thorkell, that I speak my doom about our
 matter, and not rest on the kings doom.  Then must I have this beginning
 of our atonement, that thou shallt fare with me to the Orkneys, and be with me,
 and never part from me, unless thou hast my leave;  that thou shalt be
 bound to guard my land, and do all things that I will have done so long as we
 two both live.”  Thorkell answers:  “That shall be in your power,
 lord, as well as everything else in which I may have any voice.”  Then
 Thorkell went up (to earl Thorfinn), and bound himself to the earl in
 everything that the earl laid down.  The earl says that he will utter his
 doom as to the payment of the fine (for Einar) afterwards, but he took there
 and then oaths from Thorkell, and he turned him then at once to fare away with
 the earl.  Then the earl fared away at once, as soon as ever he was boun,
 and he and king Olaf never saw each other more.  Earl Brusi stayed then
 after him and took more time to busk himself;  but ere he fared away, king
 Olaf had a meeting with him, and said, “It looks to me, earl, that I am like to
 have thee for a faithful liegeman there away over the western sea, and so I
 purpose that thou shalt have two lots of the lands to rule over, those two I
 mean which thou hadst of yore;  and my will is that thou shouldest not be
 a less man, nor a less powerful, now that thou hast given thyself into my hand,
 than thou wast before;  but I will clench thy faithfulness with this, that
 I will that thy son Rognvald be here behind.  I see then, if thou hast any
 trust and two lots of the lands, that thou mayest well hold thy own by right
 against earl Thorfinn.”  Brusi took that with thanks to have two lots of
 the lands.  Brusi stayed there a little while longer ere he fared away,
 and came about autumn west to the Orkneys.  Rognvald, Brusis son, stayed
 behind with king Olaf.  He was of all men fairest;  his hair was full
 and yellow, like silk.  He was soon tall and strong;  the most
 perfect man was he both for wits sake and courtesy.  He was long with
 king Olaf.  Ottar the black makes mention of these things in that ode
 which he made on king Olaf:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “Among thy thanes are reckoned</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Bold lads of Hialtis land,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Thou gotten hast a handy realm</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Of princes of the people;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 There was no king on earth,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Ere thou camst, warlike lord,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Who underneath his yoke could bow</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Those islands of the west.”</p>
 
 <p>         When those brothers came
 west to the Orkneys, Thorfinn and Brusi, then Brusi took two lots of the lands
 under his lordship, but Thorfinn a trithing.  He was ever in Caithness and
 Scotland, but set up his men over the isles.  At that time Brusi alone
 kept watch and ward over the isles.  But in that time they were much
 warred on, for Northmen and Danes harried much in the west, sea-roving, and
 came often to the isles when they fared west, or from the west, and seized this
 or that ness.  Brusi complained that Thorfinn had no force out to guard
 the Orkneys or Shetland, but kept the scatts and dues all to his share. 
 Then Thorfinn made him that offer, that Brusi should have a trithing of the
 lands, but Thorfinn two lots, and alone keep watch and ward over the
 land.  But though this arrangement was not made all at once, yet at last
 this settlement came about, that Brusi had a trithing and Thorfinn two
 lots.  This was when Canute had rule in Norway, but Olaf had been forced
 to fly out of the land.</p>
 
 <p>22.       Earl Thorfinn (1) made himself a
 great chief;  he was the tallest and strongest of men, ugly, black-haired,
 sharp-featured, and big-nosed, and with somewhat scowling brows.  He was a
 mighty man of strife, and greedy both of money and honour;  he was lucky
 in battle, and skilful in war, and good in onslaught;  he was then five
 winters old when Malcolm the Scot-king, his mothers father, gave him the title
 of earl and Caithness as his lordship, as was written above;  but he was
 fourteen winters when he had war levies out of his land, and harried on the
 realms of other chiefs.  So says Arnor Earlskald:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “The king amid the crash of helms</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Died red his broadswords edge,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Ere fifteen winters he had filled,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Reddener of ravens feet;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Brave chief, of Einars brothers last,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Lands good to win and guard</p>
 
 <p>                       
 He proved himself, a properer man</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Is no man neath the sky.”</p>
 
 <p>         Earl Thorfinn had much
 strength from his kinsman the Scot-king;  it was a great help to his power
 in the Orkneys that that strength was so near.  The Scot-king breathed his
 last just when those brothers, Brusi and Thorfinn, were set at one again. 
 Then Karl Houndson took the rule over Scotland;  he thought he ought to
 own Caithness too, like the former Scot-kings;  and he would have scatt
 from that part of the realm as from other places, but earl Thorfinn thought he
 had not too great a heritage after his mothers father, though he had
 Caithness.  He said that realm had been given to him, and he would pay no
 scatt for it;  now out of this arose a mighty feud, and each harried the
 others realm.  King Karl would set up in Caithness that chief whose name
 was Mumtan or Muddan;  he was his sisters son, and he gave him the title
 of earl.  Then Muddan rode down on Caithness, and gathered force together
 in Sutherland;  then news came to earl Thorfinn;  and then he drew together
 a host all over Caithness;  there came too out from the Orkneys Thorkell
 fosterer, with much force to meet the earl;  then Thorfinn fared to meet
 Muddan, and had then the greater host.  And as soon as the Scots knew that
 they had fewer men, they would not fight, (2) and rode up back to
 Scotland.  Then earl Thorfinn fared after them and laid under him
 Sutherland and Ross, and harried far and wide over Scotland;  thence he
 turned back to Caithness, but Thorkell went out to the isles.  The levies
 of the people also went home.  The earl sate in Caithness at Duncansby,
 and had there five long-ships, and just so much force as was enough to man them
 well.  Muddan came to see king Karl in Berwick, and tells him how his
 paths had not been smooth.  King Karl then got very wrath when he learned
 that his land was harried;  he went then at once on ship-board, and had
 eleven long-ships and much people;  then he held on north along
 Scotland.  Muddan he sent back to Caithness with a great force, and he
 rode the upper way through Scotland;  it was so settled that he should
 come down thence, and then Thorfinn would be in a cleft stick.  Now it
 must be told of Karl that he never slackened sail before he came to
 Caithness;  and then there was scant space between him and Thorfinn. 
 Then Thorfinn took that counsel to go on ship-board and hold out into the
 Pentland firth, and he meant to go to the Orkneys;  by that time there was
 so scant space between them, that Karl and his men saw Thorfinns sails as he
 sailed east across the firth, and they sailed after them at once. 
 Thorfinn and his men had not seen their sails, and so east he steered along the
 isles, and meant to go to Sandwick.  He ran in from the east under
 Deerness, and sent word at once to Thorkell that he should gather force
 together.  Brusi had the northermost lot of the isles, and was then
 there.  Thorfinn lay under Deerness, as was written before, and had come
 thither late.  But next morning when it was light, the first thing they
 found out was that Karl and his men were rowing up to them with eleven
 ships.  There were then two choices on hand:  the one was to jump
 ashore and leave the ships and all his goods to his foes;  the other is to
 put out to meet them and then let destiny have her sway.  Thorfinn called
 then on his men, and bade them get out their weapons;  he said he would
 not run away, and bade them row against them manfully.  And after that
 each side lashed their ships together.  Earl Thorfinn egged on his men
 much, and bade them be hot, and make the first bout hard.  As for the
 Scots, he said few of them would stand.  This fight was both hard and
 long, and it was long before it could be seen which way the day would
 turn.  Of this battle Arnor makes mention in Thorfinns ode:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “At last I trow our lord hath taught</p>
 
 <p>                       
 To mail-linked Karl a lesson,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Away east off Deerness,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 The princes rule prospered:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 With war-snakes five the wrathful chief</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Rushed gainst eleven of the king,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 And hating flight himself held on</p>
 
 <p>                       
 His course with constant heart.</p>
 
 <p>                       
 The seamen laid their ships aboard,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Along the thwarts the foemen fell,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Sharp-edged steel in blood was bathed,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Black blood of Scottish men.</p>
 
 <p>                       
 The heros heartstrings did not quake,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Bowstrings sung and blades were biting,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Shafts were shot and sweat was streaming,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Spear-heads quivered, bright and gleaming.”</p>
 
 <p>         Now earl Thorfinn egged on
 his men hotly;  then he ran his ship aboard of Karls ship, and there was
 a very hard fight.  Then the Scots held together, just before the mast on
 the kings ship, and then earl Thorfinn leaps out of the poop and forward on
 the ship, and fought most bravely.  And when he saw that men grew thin on
 board Karl's ships, he egged on his men to board;  and when king Karl saw
 that, he bade them cut the lashings and hold away. (3)  Then Thorfinn and
 his men cast grappling hooks on board the kings ship.  Then Thorfinn bade
 them bear up his banner, and he followed it thither himself, and a great
 company of men with him.  Then Karl leapt from his ship with those men
 that were left upstanding;  but the most part had fallen on board that
 ship.  Karl leapt on board another ship, and bade them take to their oars,
 and then the Scots laid themselves out to fly, but Thorfinn chased them. 
 So says Arnor:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 So much shorter was the onslaught,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 For my lord to honour dear,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Speedy drove at point of spear,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 With less force the foe to flight:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Oer that army sorely smitten</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Screamed the seamew bird of battle</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Ere their red brands sheathed the kings men;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 From Sandwick south he fought and won.”</p>
 
 <p>         Karl held on away south to
 Broadfirth, (4) and went on shore there and gathered force anew.  Thorfinn
 turned back after the battle.  Then came Thorkell fosterer to meet him,
 and then they had much people;  then they sailed south to Broadfirth after
 Karl and his men, and as soon as ever they came off Scotland they began to
 harry.  Then they were told how Muddan was north in Caithness at Thurso,
 and had there a great host;  he had also sent to Ireland after men, for he
 had there many friends and kinsmen, and there he waited for this force. 
 Then Thorfinn and Thorkell took this counsel, that Thorkell fosterer should go
 north along Caithness with some of the host, while Thorfinn lay behind off
 Scotland and harried there.  Thorkell went stealthily;  besides all
 the land-folk was true and trusty to him in Caithness;  no news of him
 went before him until he came into Thurso at dead of night, and took the house
 over the heads of Muddan and his men and set fire to it.  Muddan slept up
 in a loft, and just as he leapt out and down out of the loft gallery, Thorkell
 hewed at him, and the blow came on his neck and took off his head.  After
 that the men gave themselves up, but some got away by running.  There many
 men were slain, but there were a very great many to whom peace was given. 
 Thorkell stayed there a short while ere he fared back to Broadfirth;  he
 had then a whole host with him which he had got in Caithness and out of
 Sutherland and Ross;  then he met earl Thorfinn south of Moray, and tells
 him what had been done in his travels.  The earl thanked him well for his
 toil;  then they both lay there a while and harried the land.</p>
 
 <p>         Now it must be told about
 king Karl, that he fared up into Scotland after the battle which he had with
 earl Thorfinn, and there gathered forces anew.  He drew together a host
 all from the south of Scotland, both east and west, and from the south all the
 way to Cantire.  Then also came to meet him that host from Ireland which
 Muddan had sent after;  he sends too far and wide to chiefs for force, and
 summoned all that host to meet him against earl Thorfinn;  and the place
 where he and Thorfinn met was at Turfness, south of Broadfirth.  There
 arose a mighty battle, and the Scots had a far greater host.  Earl
 Thorfinn was at the head of his battle array;  he had a gilded helmet on
 his head, and was girt with a sword;  a great spear in his hand, and he
 fought with it, striking right and left.  So it is said that he was the
 foremost of all his men.  He went thither at first where the battle of
 those Irish was;  so hot was he with his train, that they gave way at once
 before him, and never afterwards got into good order again.  Then Karl let
 them bring forward his banner to meet Thorfinn;  there was a hard fight,
 and the end of it was, that Karl laid himself out to fly, but some men say that
 he has fallen.  But Arnor says thus:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “Gleaming edge of swords grew gory,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Turfness hight the battle-field,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Young in years the chieftain wrought it,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Twas on Monday that it fell;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Then to battle there were singing</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Blades so thin near Oikel south,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 When the sea-king sharp and shifty</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Fared to fight with Scotlands lord.</p>
 
 <p>                       
 High aloft bore Shetlands lord</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Helm amid the crash of spears,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 First in fight in Irish blood</p>
 
 <p>                       
 The warrior bathed his ruddy brand.</p>
 
 <p>                       
 My bounteous lord put forth his might</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Under his British shield,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 And Hlodvers kinsman caught the host</p>
 
 <p>                       
 And set their farms on fire.”</p>
 
 <p>         Earl Thorfinn drove the
 flight before him a long way up into Scotland, and after that he fared about
 far and wide over the land and laid it under him.  He fared then so far
 south as Fife, and laid the land under him;  men went under him wherever
 he fared.  And then while he was staying in Fife he sent away from him
 Thorkell fosterer with some of his force.  And when the Scots knew that,
 how the earl had sent away from him some of his host, those very same came against
 him who had already given themselves up to him;  and as soon as ever the
 earl was ware of their guile, he fetched together his force and fared to meet
 them;  then the Scots were slower in their onslaught when they knew the
 earl was ready for them.  Earl Thorfinn made ready to fight as soon as
 ever he met the Scots;  but then they did not dare to defend themselves,
 but broke off at once into flight, and fled wide away to woods and
 wastes.  And when Thorfinn had chased the fleers, he got together his men,
 and says that then he will let them burn all that district in which they were
 then were, and so pay the Scots for their enmity and treachery.  Then the
 earls men fared among thorpes and farms, and so burned everything, that not a
 cot stood after them;  they slew too all the fighting-men they found, but
 women and old men dragged themselves off to woods and wastes with weeping and
 wailing.  Much folk too they made captives of war and put them into bonds,
 and so drove them before them.  So says Arnor:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “Homesteads then in blaze were blasted, </p>
 
 <p>                       
 Danger that day did not fail them,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Ruddy flame oer reeking roofs</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Leapt throughout the Scottish land;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Manslayers paid their footing painful</p>
 
 <p>                       
 To men, and in one summers space</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Thrice they got the lesser lot</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Before our chief, the caitiff Scots.”</p>
 
 <p>         After that earl Thorfinn
 fared north along Scotland to his ships, and laid under him the land wherever
 he went.  He fared then north to Caithness, and sate there that
 winter;  but every summer thenceforth he had his levies out, and harried
 about the West lands, but sat most often still in the winters.</p>
 
 <p>23.       Earl Thorfinn did that noble deed in
 the Orkneys, that he furnished all his body-guard and many other powerful men
 all the winter through, both with meat and drink, so that no man needed to go
 into inn or boarding-house;  just as it is the custom with kings or earls
 in other lands to furnish their body-guard and guests with meat and drink at
 Yule.  So says Arnor:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “All throughout the scourge of serpents, (5)</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Rognvalds royal progeny</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Drank the lake of barleycorn,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Then the chieftain gleamed in glory.”</p>
 
 <p>         At this time earl Brusi
 breathed his last, and then Thorfinn took under him all the Orkneys.  But
 it must be told of Rognvald Brusis son, that he was in the battle at
 Sticklestead when the saint king Olaf fell;  Rognvald got away with the
 rest of the men who fled.  He brought out of the battle Harold Sigurds
 son, king Olafs brother;  Harold was very much wounded.  Rognvald
 left him to be healed at a small freemans house, but Rognvald then fared east
 across the Keel to Jemtland, and thence to Sweden, to find King Œnund. 
 Harold was with the freeman till he was healed;  the freeman then gave his
 son for a guide to Harold, and they fared east to Jemtland, and thence to
 Sweden, and fared much with hooded head. (6)  Harold sung this stave as
 they ride over some thickets. (7)</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Now pass I wood on wood,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Wandering little worth;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Who knows whether I may be</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Widely known hereafter.”</p>
 
 <p>         Harold went in Sweden to
 meet Rognvald Brusis son.  Thence they both fared east to Russia, and
 much folk beside who had been with king Olaf.  They did not stop till they
 came east into Holmgard (8) to meet king Jarizleif;  he made them welcome
 for the sake of the saint king Olaf.  Then they were made land-warders
 over Russia, all of them, and earl Eilif, the son of earl Rognvald Wolfs son.</p>
 
 <p>24.       Rognvald Brusis son stayed behind
 in Russia when Harold Sigurds son fared out to Micklegarth
 (Constantinople);  Rognvald had then the wardenship of the land in the
 summers, but was in Holmgard in the winters.  King Jarizleif esteemed him
 much, and all the people too.  Rognvald was, as was written before, taller
 and stronger than any man;  he was the fairest too of men in his face, and
 a most gifted man both in mind and body, so that his match was not to be
 found.  So says Arnor earlskald, that Rognvald had in Russia ten pitched
 battles.</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “He flourished as a fruitful tree,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 And fierce in fight as battles God,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Ten storms of swords that file the shield</p>
 
 <p>                       
 In Russias regions won.”</p>
 
 <p>         When they, Einar
 Thambaskelfir (9);  and Kalf Arnis son, sought out Magnus Olafs son,
 east in Russia, Rognvald met them at Aldeigjuborg; (10)  then he was just
 about falling on Kalf until Einar made him aware in what way it stood with
 their journey.  Einar let Rognvald be told that Kalf repented him of that
 wickedness that he had killed the saint king Olaf from off the face of the
 land, and now he will atone for that in his son;  says that Kalf then
 wishes to raise Magnus to rule in Norway and strengthen him against the
 Knutlings.  And after that Rognvald softened down;  then Einar begs
 him to make up his mind to a journey with them up to Holmgard, and to back
 their suit with king Jarizleif, and Rognvald says yea to that.  After that
 they hire themselves carriage in Aldeigjuborg and drive up to Holmgard, and
 find there king Jarizleif, then they bring forward their errand, and say that
 the rule of the Knutlings and of Alfifa most of all had got so wearisome to
 them, that they cannot at all bear to serve them any longer.  Then they
 beg that king Jarizleif would give over to them Magnus Olafs son as a
 chief.  Then Rognvald backs their suit with them, and so does Ingigerd the
 queen, and many other chiefs.  The king was slow to give over Magnus into
 the hands of the Northmen, after what they had done towards the saint king Olaf
 his father:  but still it came about in this way, that twelve of the most
 noble men swore to king Jarizleif this oath, that all was true and trustworthy,
 but king Jarizleif forbore to take the oath of Rognvald for his faithfulness'
 sake.  Kalf swore that oath to Magnus, that he would follow him without
 the land and within the land, and do all those things that Magnus thought more
 or safer for his power.  After that the Northmen took Magnus for their
 king, and became hand-bound to him.  Kalf and his friends stayed at
 Holmgard until Yule went by;  then they fared down to Aldeigjuborg and got
 ship there;  they fared at once from the east as soon as the ice loosened
 in the spring;  then Rognvald Brusis son, made up his mind to journey
 with the king.  They fared first to Sweden, as is said in king Magnus
 saga, and thence to Jemtland, and so from the east across the Keel to
 Verdale.  And as soon as Magnus came into Drontheim, all the people came
 under his power.  Then he fared to Nidaros, and was there taken to be king
 over all the land at the Eyra Thing.  After that came about the dealings
 which he had with king Sweyn, as is said in the Lives of the kings of Norway.</p>
 
 <p>25.       When Rognvald Brusis son came into
 Norway, he heard of the death of earl Brusi his father;  he heard also
 this, that earl Thorfinn had taken under him all the Orkneys.  Then
 Rognvald was eager to go to his own land, and begged that King Magnus would
 give him leave to do that.  King Magnus saw that this was needful to
 Rognvald, and stood well with him in this matter.  Then king Magnus gave
 Rognvald the title of earl, and three longships, and all well manned;  he
 gave him also in fief that trithing which king Olaf had owned in the Orkneys,
 and which he had given to Brusi, Rognvalds father.  Then king Magnus
 promised to Rognvald his foster-brother his entire friendship, and said he
 might reckon his strength his own whenever he needed it.  Thus they parted
 with such like love-tokens as now were written.</p>
 
 <p>26.       Rognvald Brusis son sailed west to
 the Orkneys, and fared first to those homesteads which his father had
 owned;  then he sent a message to earl Thorfinn his kinsman, and begged to
 have that trithing of the isles which his father had owned.  He made them
 also tell Thorfinn that king Magnus gave him in fief that trithing of the lands
 which king Olaf had owned.  He begged to have those two lots of the lands
 at his will of his kinsman Thorfinn.  But at that time earl Thorfinn had
 great quarrels with the Southislanders and the Irish;  he thought he had
 much need of help in men, and he made these answers to Rognvalds messengers,
 that he shall take of a surety that trithing of the isles which he owned by
 right, “but that trithing which Magnus claims as his, then we yielded in that
 to king Olaf, more for that we were come within his grasp, than because we
 thought it right;  and so we and our kinsman Rognvald will agree all the
 more if we two talk little to each other about that trithing of the
 lands;  it has long been a cause of quarrel.  But if Rognvald will be
 a trusty kinsman and strengthener to me, then methinks my realm will be well
 bestowed if he has that trithing as a pastime for himself and a strength for both
 of us.  In short, his help is worth more to me than the scatts which I get
 from it.”  After that the messengers fared back, and said to Rognvald that
 Thorfinn had yielded to him two lots of the lands, if he will be his
 strengthener, as ought to be for kinships sake.  Rognvald says that he
 had only laid claim to what he thought he owned.  But for that Thorfinn
 gave the lands up so readily, he said he would of a surety be willing to lend
 him help and to be his entire friend, just as their kinship bound them. 
 Now Rognvald took under him two lots of the lands, and so things stood that
 winter.  But very early in the spring earl Thorfinn sent word to his
 kinsman Rognvald, and begs him to fare a-roving with him, and to bring as many
 men as he could get with him.  And when these words came to Rognvald, he
 got ready at once and drew a host together, and gathered to himself all the
 ships he could get;  and when that host was boun, he fared to meet earl
 Thorfinn;  then Thorfinn had also got his host boun;  and he gave his
 kinsman Rognvald a good welcome, and then they went into fellowship together.</p>
 
 <p>27.        Those kinsmen Thorfinn and
 Rognvald harried that summer over the Southern isles and Ireland, and far and
 wide about Scotlands firths.  Thorfinn laid the land under him wherever
 they fared.  In the summer they had a great fight in the place called
 Waterfirth; (11) there was a great loss of men.  They took to battle
 speedily, and those kinsmen won a bright victory.  Of this battle Arnor
 earlskald makes mention in Thorfinns ode:  He was there in the battle.</p>
 
 <p>“There was I where Waterfirth</p>
 
 <p>The place is hight in mickle risk,</p>
 
 <p>With my Lord the friend of man,</p>
 
 <p>Of his works I know the tokens;</p>
 
 <p>From the ships the warriors speedy</p>
 
 <p>Bore the shieldburg, Friday morning</p>
 
 <p>There I saw the gray wolf gaping</p>
 
 <p>Oer wounded corse of many a man.”</p>
 
 <p>         After this battle they
 turned back to the Orkneys, and sate still through that winter.  And so
 eight winters went by that Rognvald had two lots of the isles, so that earl
 Thorfinn made no complaint about it.  But every summer they were a-roving,
 sometimes both together, but sometimes each of them by himself, as Arnor says:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “He who loved was often working,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Irelands offspring fell before him,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 When he fell on British races,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Fire flew oer Scotlands realm.”</p>
 
 <p>28.       With those kinsmen everything went
 always well when they met;  but if bad (worse) men went between them
 (tale-bearing) the disputes were always talked out.  Earl Thorfinn sate
 long in Caithness, and Rognvald in the isles.  It fell out one summer that
 earl Thorfinn harried in the Southern isles and about the West Coast of
 Scotland.  He lay at the place called Galloway, there Scotland and England
 meet.  He had sent away from him a force south to England to land and
 seize and slaughter cattle, for there where he lay with his force all the folk
 had fled away, and all the cattle were driven away from him.  But when the
 Englishmen were ware of the Vikings, they gathered themselves together and fell
 upon them, and took from them all the cattle, but slew of them all the men who
 were fit for anything, but sent back some runagates, and bade them tell earl
 Thorfinn how they made Vikings sick of wrong and robbery;  and they had
 besides about it many scornful words.  So they fared to find earl
 Thorfinn, and told him how ill they had fared.  He took it ill that his
 men were lost, but said he could not help it;  but this he said he was
 well able to do, and that was to pay off the Englishmen for all the gibes and
 jeers which they made out of the matter;  and he said he must first of all
 part from them for a while, but if he were safe and sound next summer he said
 he and they should meet.</p>
 
 <p>29.       At that time Hardicanute was (king)
 over England and Denmark.  After that earl Thorfinn fared to the Orkneys
 and sate there that winter.  Early in the spring he called out his levies
 over all his realm;  then he sent a message to his kinsman Rognvald, and
 Rognvald agrees to it.  Rognvald had a levy over all his realm.  Earl
 Thorfinn drew together a host from the Orkneys and Caithness;  he had also
 a mighty host from Scotland and Ireland, and from all the Southern isles people
 flocked to him.  He held on with all that host to England just as he had
 promised them the autumn before.  Hardicanute was in Denmark when these
 tidings happened.  But as soon as ever the earls came to England they
 began to harry and waste;  but those chiefs who were set there to watch
 the land fared against them with force, and there was a great and hard battle,
 and the earls got the victory.  After that they fared far and wide over
 England, and harried, slew men, and burned the farms wherever they went. 
 This Arnor mentions in Thorfinns ode:</p>
 
 <p>“One there was that Angles mind</p>
 
 <p>Storm of spears, nor evermore</p>
 
 <p>Shall the lord of rings come thither</p>
 
 <p>WIth a greater force to battle.</p>
 
 <p>Thin-ground swords bit sturdy people,</p>
 
 <p>But the child of ancient Rognvald</p>
 
 <p>Rushed beneath his buckler thither,</p>
 
 <p>South from Man across the main.</p>
 
 <p>On English native land his banner</p>
 
 <p>Bore the earl, and often reddened</p>
 
 <p>Tongue of eagles, troops to carry</p>
 
 <p>Ensigns onward still he ordered,</p>
 
 <p>Fire waxed and homes were blazing,</p>
 
 <p>As the army chased the fleers,</p>
 
 <p>Flames spread fast, and near to heaven</p>
 
 <p>Smote the glare of forests foeman. (12)</p>
 
 <p>Many blasts of horns were blowing,</p>
 
 <p>Through the burgs when bold to battle</p>
 
 <p>Rushed the ruler, while his banner</p>
 
 <p>Fluttered bravely in the breeze.</p>
 
 <p>Twas on a rainy Friday morning,</p>
 
 <p>When the day scarce beamed for battle,</p>
 
 <p>That the foeman fierce he scattered;</p>
 
 <p>Weapons flew and wolves were fattened.”</p>
 
 <p>         Earl Thorfinn had two
 pitched battles in England, but on the other hand he gave them many defeats and
 man-slayings.  He lay there almost all the summer through, but at autumn
 he fared hom to the Orkneys, and was there that winter.</p>
 
 <p>30.   At this time Kalf Arnis son fled out of the land before
 king Magnus.  He fared west across the sea to his nephew-in-law earl
 Thorfinn.  Thorfinn had then to wife Ingibiorg earlsmother, the daughter
 of earl Finn Arnis son.  Then Kalf was in great love with earl
 Thorfinn.  He held about him a great following of men;  that was very
 costly to the earl.  There were many, too, then who said out before him
 that he should not let Rognvald have two lots of the isles, when he had to
 spend so much money himself.  And after that earl Thorfinn sent men out
 into the isles, and asked for that trithing from earl Rognvald, which earl
 Einar wrymouth had owned.  But when that message came, the earl brought it
 before his friends and counsellors.  After that he calls thither earl
 Thorfinns messengers.  Rognvald says, that as for that lot of the isles
 which they claim, he had taken it in fief from king Magnus, and that the king
 called it his fathers heritage.  Now he said king Magnus had power to say
 which of them should own that lot;  but he said he would not let it go if
 it were the kings will that he should have it.  On this the messengers
 fared away, and tell earl Thorfinn those words.  They said, too, it was
 surely to be looked for that this would not be got without a struggle. 
 But when earl Thorfinn heard that, he grew very wrath, and said it was a likely
 story that king Magnus was to have his brothers heritage.  He said, too,
 that had been agreed to more because he and earl Brusi were then come into king
 Olafs grasp than because it was a fair and rightful sharing of the
 inheritance.  “Now methinks Rognvald doth not repay me well when I have
 now let him have that realm in freedom for a while, if I shall not now come
 near the heritage my brother has left me unless I fight for it.”  Earl
 Thorfinn was so wrath at this, that no long time after he sends men into the
 Southern isles, and up into Scotland, and drew a force together.  He gave
 it out too, that he meant to come to blows with earl Rognvald, and then take
 that without forbearance which he could not get when he sought for it in
 peace.  And now, when this is told to earl Rognvald, that earl Thorfinn
 was gathering a force against him, he summoned his friends about him, and moots
 this with them, that earl Thorfinn his kinsman means to come to blows with him
 with a host and strife.  He asked then what force they will furnish him
 with, and says he is not willing to lose his own without one trial of
 strength.  But when he begged for their judgment on this matter then men
 gave it in very different ways.  Some spoke after earl Rognvald, and said
 it was to be forgiven him that he did not wish to share his realm;  but
 there were some who said it was to be forgiven to Thorfinn that he wished to
 have the realm for a while, when Rognvald had already had that lot which earl
 Einar had owned.  They said, too, it was bad counsel that Rognvald should
 lay himself out to fight against Thorfinn with that force which he could get
 from two lots of the isles, when Thorfinn had a trithing and Caithness, and a
 great share of Scotland and all the Southern isles.  There were men, too,
 who spoke and said that a peaceful settlement must be sought, who beg that
 Rognvald would offer earl Thorfinn a half of the isles, and so in that way
 their kinship might still be saved.  But when Rognval found that each had
 a way of his own, but all were against his resisting, then he laid bare his
 will, and said that he will not cut his realm asunder by any settlement; 
 that he would far rather give up the realm at once, and go to seek king Magnus
 his fosterbrother, and look after what strength the king will give him to hold
 his realm.  After that he makes ready for his voyage, and fares east to
 Norway, nor does he slacken his course before he comes into the presence of
 king Magnus.  And when he is come thither, he tells the king the whole
 story.  The king made earl Rognvald good cheer, and bade him be with him
 so long as he liked, and to take a fief of him so large that he could well
 maintain himself and his people;  but earl Rognvald told the king that he
 wished he would give him strength enough to seek back his realm.  King
 Magnus said of a surety he would aid him with strength to get what he
 asked.  Rognvald stayed a short time in Norway ere he began his voyage
 west to the Orkneys.  He had then many picked men whom king Magnus had
 granted him.  And this went with him too;  he (the king) sent word to
 Kalf Arnis son, that he should have his lands and leave to live in Norway, if
 he would stand by earl Rognvald in this quarrel between him and earl Thorfinn.</p>

 <p>31.        Earl Rognvald sailed from
 Norway west towards the Orkneys, and made Shetland from the sea, and drew force
 to himself, and thence fared south into the Orkneys.  There he summoned
 his friends to meet him, and gathered force thence.  Earl Thorfinn was
 over in Caithness, and news came to him at once of Rognvalds doings, and he
 drew force to himself from Scotland and the Southern isles.  Earl Rognvald
 sent at once the message of king Magnus to Kalf Arnis son, and Kalf took in a
 kind way all that the king had spoken.  Earl Rognvald drew his host
 together in the Orkneys, and meant to cross over into the Ness.  But when
 he came into the Pentland firth, then he had thirty war-ships, all big and in
 good trim.  There came against him earl Thorfinn, and had sixty ships, and
 most of them small.  Their meeting was off the Red Head, and they ran into
 battle at once.  There, too, was come Kalf Arnis son, and had six ships,
 and all great, and did not run into the fight.  And now arises the hardest
 battle;  either earl egged on his people.  But when things had gone
 on so for a while, the loss of men turns on earl Thorfinns side, and that was
 most because the difference in the height of the ships sides was great. 
 Thorfinn had a great ship, and in good trim, and in that he ran forward most
 bravely.  But when the decks of the smaller ships were cleared, then the
 earls ship was run aboard of on both sides;  and then they stood in very
 great need.  Then numbers of men fell on board the earls ship, but some
 were very badly wounded.  Earl Rognvald then egged on his men to
 board;  but when earl Thorfinn saw into what a bad plight they were come,
 he made them cut his ship away from her lashings and rowed to land.  He
 made them bear out of his ship seventy corpses.  There, too, went out all
 those who were unfightworthy for their wounds sake.  Then earl Thorfinn
 begged Arnor earlskald to go out of the ship;  he was in the earls train,
 and held in great love.  He went on shore and chaunted a song:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “This man is loath to go against</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Brusis son, ones lord to follow</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Is good, that lesson to the people</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Neer shall I be found gainsaying;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Hard the choice we have before us</p>
 
 <p>                       
 If these earls so full of fury</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Fall to blows, a time of trial</p>
 
 <p>                       
 For friendship we shall surely see.”</p>
 
 <p>         Earl Thorfinn mans his ship
 with the best men he had left.  After that he fares to find Kalf, and
 asked him for help.  He said thus, that Kalf could not get bought back the
 friendship of king Magnus when he had already been forced to flee out of the
 land.  “When thou foundest it no good that thou hadst already been taken
 into very great love.  So mayest thou make up thy mind if Rognvald is
 victorious over us, and if the power of king Magnus and of him spreads here
 over the western sea, that then thou wilt not be welcome here.  But if we
 win the day, then nothing shall fall short to you that I have power to
 give.  We two shall be at no mans mercy here across the western sea, if
 we two are both of one mind.  And thou wilt not surely like to have that
 on your mind that thou liest here like a cat in a cave, while I fight for the
 freedom of us both.  Besides, there are those ties between us two, that it
 beseems each of us better to lend the other help, since men who are bound to
 you by no ties are against us.”  But when Kalf heard the egging on of
 Thorfinn, he called on his men, and bade them put out to battle together with
 earl Thorfinn.  As Bjarni Gullbrar-Skald says:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “We have heard, O Kalf, to hurly</p>
 
 <p>                       
 How Finns son-in-law thou followedst,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 And thy war-snakes oer the waters</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Swiftly swept against the earl;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Gold-begetter, vengeance-mindful,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 All unwilling to attack</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Brusis son so bold in battle;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Thorfinn had thy help at last.”</p>
 
 <p>         Now they made an onslaught
 by rowing, both of them together, earl thorfinn and Kalf.  And when they
 came to the fight, Thorfinns host was ready to flee, but very many of them
 were fallen.  The earl ran his ship against the ship of earl Rognvald, and
 there arose the hardest fight.  So says Arnor:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “I saw both my goldbestowers,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Each the others henchmen hewing,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 On the fitful firth of Pentland;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Thence my grief grew more and more;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Sea was blood-stained, black kept dripping</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Gore between the gaping seams,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Sweat was shed on rim of shield,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 All the sides with blood were dabbled.”</p>
 
 <p>         Kalf ran up against the
 smaller ships of Rognvald and cleared their decks quickly, for there was a
 great difference in the height of their sides.  But when the levies who
 had come from Norway saw ships cleared hard by them, they then loosed their
 ships from their lashings and laid themselves out to fly, so that scarce a ship
 was left behind with the earls ship.  Then the fight began to turn. 
 So says Arnor earlskald:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “The lord, so brave in burst of battle,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Then had surely laid beneath him</p>
 
 <p>                       
 All that ancient land of Orkney,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 --- He had far less loss of men, ---</p>
 
 <p>                       
 If the sea-king son of Endil</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Could have brought that host to help him,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Island-born, but Shetlands lord,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 By his army was betrayed.”</p>
 
 <p>         And now that the main host
 had fled, then they, Kalf and Thorfinn, both ran aboard of earl Rognvalds
 ship, and then many men of earl Rognvalds fell.  And when earl Rognvald
 saw in what a straight he was come, and that he could not conquer Thorfinn and
 Kalf both, then he made them hew the lashings asunder, and laid himself out to
 fly.  Then the day was far spent, and it began to grow dark.  Earl
 Rognvald sailed at once that night into the main, and so east to Norway; 
 he did not slacken his course till he came into king Magnus presence;  he
 made him welcome now as before, and bade him be with him;  and there earl
 Rognvald stayed a while.</p>
 
 <p>32.       Now it is to be said of earl
 Thorfinn, that on the morning after the fight he made them row about all the
 isles to search for the men who had fled.  Many were slain, but some came
 to terms of peace;  then earl Thorfinn laid under him all the isles, and
 made every man come into his hand, (1) and those as well who had been before
 bound by an oath to Rognvald.  He sat himself up then in the Orkneys with
 a very great band of men, and drew his supplies from Caithness on the other
 side.  But Kalf Arnis son, he sends into the Southland isles, and let him
 sit there as a means of strength for himself.  But when earl Rognvald had
 stayed in Norway awhile with king Magnus, he said to the king that he would try
 back to the Orkneys.  But when the king heard that, he called it unwise to
 fare before the winter abated and ice loosened and the sea began to thaw; 
 said he then would give him ships and crews as many as he needed. 
 Rognvald speaks thus, and said now he was not willing to lose king Magnus
 men;  said, too, that it could not be carried out unless with great loss
 of men, if he gathered a host to come to blows with Thorfinn and Karl, such a
 large realm as they have there west:  “I mean now,” he said, “to hold on
 west with one ship, and to man it as well as I can;  then I ween that no
 news of us will be borne before us.  Then it will either be, that we shall
 come upon them unawares, and then we may speedily win that victory which we should
 win hardly or not at all with a great force.  But if they become aware of
 our voyage, then we will let the sea still take care of us.”  King Magnus
 bade him fare as he liked, but to come back to him again as soon as he
 chose.  And after that earl Rognvald makes ready his voyage and takes
 pains in choosing men to go with him;  and some of the kings bodyguard
 made up their minds to go with him;  then he had a picked force.  And
 when they were boun they sailed away to sea.  That was about the beginning
 of winter. (2)</p>
 
 <p>33.       Earl Rognvald made Shetland from the
 sea; then he learnt that earl Thorfinn was in the Orkneys and had no very great
 force with him;  he had then no fear of war in high-winter.  Now
 Rognvald held on straightway south to the Orkneys.  Earl Thorfinn was then
 in Hrossey, and had no fear for himself.  But as soon as Rognvald came
 into the Orkneys he held on thither where he heard Thorfinn was, and came upon
 him so unawares, that nothing was heard of them before they had seized all the
 doors of the house which Thorfinn and his men were in.  It was night then,
 and most men were asleep, but the earl sat then still a-drinking. 
 Rognvald and his men bore fire to the homestead;  but when earl Thorfinn
 was ware of the strife, he sent men to the doors and let them ask, who had sway
 over the strife.  Then it was said that Earl Rognvald was come
 thither.  Then men sprung to their arms.  Then nothing could be done
 in the way of defence, because outlet was shut to all.  The house began
 soon to blaze.  Thorfinn gave counsel that men should beg for leave to go
 of the earl, and he allowed it to all women and unfree men, but said most of
 earl Thorfinns bodyguard would be no better to him alive than dead.  So
 those men were drawn out to whom peace was given and then the whole house was
 soon burning.  Earl Thorfinn broke away a wainscot panel at the back of
 the house, and sprung out there;  he had Ingibjorg his wife in his
 arms.  The night was pitch dark and moonless, and he got away under the
 smoke, so that the earls men were not ware of him.  He rowed at once that
 night alone in a boat over to the Ness.  Earl Rognvald burned down the
 whole homestead, and all those men who were inside it, to whom leave was not
 given to go out.  Now no man thought anything else than that earl Thorfinn
 had lost his life there.  After this earl Rognvald fared about over all
 the isles and laid them under him.  He sent also those words over to
 Caithness and to the Southern isles, that he meant to claim all that realm that
 earl Thorfinn had owned.  No man gainsaid him in this.  Earl Thorfinn
 was in divers places in hiding in Caithness with his friends, and no news went
 abroad that he had got away from the burning.</p>
 
 <p>34.       Earl Rognvald sat in Kirkwall, and
 drew thither the stores which he needed to have for his winter quarters. 
 He had a great band of men, and much good cheer.  But a little before Yule
 earl Rognvald fared with a great following into the Little Papey to fetch malt,
 to be brewed for Yule.  And at even, as they were on the isle, they sate
 long over a roasting fire, and he who made up the fire spoke and said that the
 firewood began to fall short.  Then the earl made a slip of the tongue,
 and these were the words he spoke:  “Then are we full old when these fires
 are burnt out.”  But he meant so to have spoken, that they would then be
 full warmed.  And as soon as ever he found it out, he said “I have not
 made a slip of the tongue before this so that I call it to mind;  it comes
 into my mind what king Olaf my foster-father said at Sticklestead when I took
 him up for a slip of the tongue:  If it ever happens that I made a slip of
 the tongue I might make up my mind that I should then have but a short time
 unlived.  May be that my kinsman Thorfinn is yet alive.”  And just then
 they heard how that the homestead was girt round by men.  There was come
 earl Thorfinn.  They bore fire at once to the house, and laid up a pile of
 fuel before the doors.  They allowed all to go out save the earls
 men.  And when most of the men were drawn out, a man went out into the
 doorway in linen underclothes, and begged earl Thorfinn to stretch out his hand
 toward the deacon.  But that man rested his hands on the balk of wood
 across the doorway, and vaulted out over the balk and the ring of men, so that
 he came down ever so far off all of them, and was lost in the darkness of
 night.  Thorfinn bade them hold on after him, and says there went earl
 Rognvald, “this is his nimbleness, and no ones else.”  Then they fared to
 hunt for him, and parted themselves into companies, and Thorkell fosterer went
 along the sea-shore to search.  They heard how a dog barked among the
 rocks on the seashore.  Earl Rognvald had his lapdog with him, and he
 betrayed the earl. (3)  They put him to death at once among the rocks, and
 it is the story of some men that Thorkell fosterer slew him, because there were
 no other men who would do it.  But he had sworn to do all those deeds
 which seemed to Thorfinn more for his realms safety than otherwise. 
 Thorfinn and his men stayed that night on the isle, and there all the train
 that had followed Rognvald thither were slain.  But the morning after they
 took a ship of burden and laded her with malt.  After that they went on
 board, and left the shields at stem and prow which Rognvald and his men had owned. 
 They let, too, no more men be seen in the ship than had followed the
 earl.  Then they rowed to Kirkwall.  And when the followers of
 Rognvald who were in the town saw that, they thought that there earl Rognvald
 must be coming and his men;  then they went to meet him, and most of them
 unarmed.  Earl Thorfinn let them there take about thirty men and slay
 them.  They were most of them of king Magnus bodyguard and his
 friends.  The earl gave peace to one of king Magnus bodyguard, and bade
 that man fare east to Norway and tell these tidings to king Magnus.</p>
 
 <p>35.       The body of earl Rognvald was
 carried to the Greater Papey, and there buried;  and it was the saying of
 men that he has been by far the best bred man and with most friends of all the
 Orkney earls, and his death was a great grief to many a man.  After that
 earl Thorfinn laid all the isles under him, and now no man gainsaid him in
 that.  Early in the spring came these tidings east to Norway, and king
 Magnus thought the loss of Rognvald, his foster-brother, the greatest scathe,
 and said he would avenge him as soon as ever he had time.  But he had at
 that time great strife with king Sweyn Ulfson, who had then let himself be
 chosen to be king over Denmark.</p>
 
 <p>36.       At that time came into Norway Harold
 Sigurds son, the kinsman of king Magnus, and king Magnus gave him half
 Norway.  They were both kings in Norway one winter.  Then they called
 out a levy over all Norway and meant to go south to Denmark.  But when
 they lay in the Selisles two long-ships ran into the haven, and up to king
 Magnus ship.  A man went from the long ship in a white cowl, and aft
 along the ship and up into the poop.  The king sate over meat.  This
 man hailed the king, and bowed before him, took up a loaf of bread and broke a
 bit off and ate.  The king took his greeting, and reached out to him the
 bowl when he saw that he ate the bread.  This man took the bowl, and
 said:  “We want peace, messmate.”  The king looked at him, and said,
 “Who art thou?”  “I am Thorfinn, Sigurds son.”  “Art thou earl
 Thorfinn,” says the king.  “So I am called west yonder,” says he, “but I
 am come hither with two ships of twenty benches each, and rather well manned,
 so far as we are able.  Now I will row on this levy with you, if ye will
 take help of me.  But all my matter and I myself shall be at Gods command
 and yours, lord, for the sake of those great misdeeds which I have broken
 against your will.”  Then men went up and heard their talk.  The king
 was slow in answering, and spoke thus:  “True it is, earl Thorfinn, that I
 had not meant, if the meeting of us two ever took place as it has now done,
 that thou shouldst be able to tell of our parting.  But now things have
 happened so, that it beseems not my honour that I should take and kill thee, 
 now thou shalt fare with me, but the terms of our atonement I will utter at my
 leisure."” Earl Thorfinn bade the king good-bye, and went to his
 ships.  The king lay a very long time in the Selisles.  Then a host
 gathered thither to him out of the Bay.  He meant to sail thence south
 under Jutland as soon as he got a fair wind.  Earl Thorfinn was then often
 long a-talking with the king.  The king treated him well, and took him
 much into his counsels.  It fell out one day that the earl went on board the
 kings ship, and aft into the poop.  The king bade him sit by him. 
 The earl sat him down, and they both drank together and were merry.  A
 tall brisk man in a red kirtle came into the poop, that man hailed the
 king.  The king took his greeting blithely;  that was one of the
 kings bodyguard.  This man began to speak, and said, “Thee am I come to
 find, earl Thorfinn.”  “What wilt thou of me,” says the earl.  “I
 want to know with what thou wilt atone to me for my brother, whom thou letst to
 be slain west in Kirkwall, along with other thanes of king Magnus.”  “Hast
 thou not heard that,” says the earl, “that I am not wont to atone for those men
 with money whom I cause to be slain.  And this is how it is, that methinks
 I have always had good cause when I have let men be slain.”  “It is no
 business of mine how thou hast done by other men, if thou atonest for this one,
 on whose behalf I make this claim.  Besides, I left behind me there some
 goods of my own, and for myself I was shamefully treated.  I have the best
 right, therefore, to make this claim in my brothers name and my own, and I
 will have amends for it.  But the king may as well forgive everything that
 is done against him, if he thinks it nothing worth when his thanes are led out
 and hewn down like sheep.”  The earl answers:  “I see plainly that it
 is all the better for me here that thou hast not had power over me.  Art
 thou not that man to whom I gave peace yonder.”  “Sure enough I am,” says
 he;  “it was in thy choice to slay me there and then like other
 men.”  Then the earl answers:  “Sooth it is, as the saying goes, that
 many things happen that one least looks for.  I thought then that I
 could never be so placed that I should have to pay for being too peaceable to
 my foes;  but now I am to smart for having given thee mercy.  Thou
 wouldest not be able to cry out against me today before princes if I had let
 thee be slain like the rest of thy companions.”  The king looked at the
 earl and said:  “There it comes out though, earl Thorfinn, that thou
 thinkest thou hast slain too few of my thanes without atonement.”  The
 king was then as red as blood.  The earl sprang up then, and went down out
 of the poop and on board his ship.  Then all was quiet that evening. 
 But next morning, when men were woke, a fair breeze was come.  Then men
 rowed straightway out of the haven.  The king sailed then south into
 Jutlands sea with all the fleet.  The earls ship sailed a good deal
 westward to the open sea at the beginning of the day;  but when the day
 began to wear away, the earl steered west into the main.  There is nothing
 to be said about him before he came to the Orkneys and sate down there in his
 realm.  King Magnus and Harold sailed to Denmark, and stayed there that
 summer.  King Sweyn would not come out to meet them;  he was in Scanör
 with his host.  In that summer king Magnus took that sickness which led
 him to his death.  He gave it out then before all the people that he gave
 all the realm of Norway to his fathers brother Harold. (4)</p>
 
 <p>37.        Earl Thorfinn now ruled over
 the Orkneys and all the rest of his realms.  Kalf, Arnis son, was also
 mostly with him.  Sometimes he went west sea-roving, and harried the
 coasts of Scotland and Ireland;  he was also in England, and was for a
 while over the Thingmens band.  When earl Thorfinn heard of the death of
 king Magnus, he sent then men east to Norway to find king Harold and greet him
 with friendly words;  he says, thus, that he wishes to become his
 friend.  But when that message came to the king, he took it well, and the
 king promised him his friendship.  And when this message came back to the
 earl, he made ready his voyage, and had with him from the west two ships of
 twenty benches each, and more than a hundred  men, all fine picked
 fellows.  Then he fared east to Norway, and found the king in
 Hördaland.  He gave him a very hearty welcome;  and at their parting
 the king gave him good gifts.  Thence the earl sailed south along the land
 and so to Denmark.  There he fared round the land, and found king Sweyn in
 Aalborg;  he asked the earl to his house, and made him a grand
 feast.  Then the earl laid bare his purpose how he meant to go south to
 Rome.  But when he came to Saxony, he met there the kaiser Henry, and he
 gave the earl a very hearty welcome, and gave him many great gifts.  He
 got him, too, many horses, and then he made ready his journey south.  Then
 he fared to Rome and saw the pope there, and there he took absolution from him
 for all his misdeeds.  The earl turned thence to his journey home, and
 came back safe and sound into his realm;  and that journey was most
 famous.  Then the earl sat down quietly and kept peace over all his
 realm.  Then he left off warfare;  then he turned his mind to ruling
 the people and land, and to law-giving.  He sate almost always in Birsay,
 and let them build there Christchurch, a splendid minster.  There first
 was set up a bishops seat in the Orkneys.  Earl Thorfinn had to wife
 Ingibjorg earlsmother;  they had two sons, who grew up out of
 childhood;  the name of one was Paul and the others Erlend;  they
 were tall men and fair, and took more after their mothers side.  They
 were men wise and meek.  The earl loved them much, and so too did all the
 people.</p>
 
 <p>38.       Earl Thorfinn held all his realms
 till his death day;  it is soothly said that he has been the most powerful
 of all the Orkney earls.  He owned nine earldoms in Scotland, and all the
 Southern isles, and he had a great realm in Ireland.  So says Arnor
 earlskald:</p>
 
 <p>“All the way from Tuskar-skerry</p>
 
 <p>Down to Dublin hosts obeyed him,</p>
 
 <p>Royal Thorfinn, raven-feeder;</p>
 
 <p>True I tell how liegemen loved him.”</p>
 
 <p>         Earl Thorfinn was then five
 winters old when Malcolm the Scot-king, his mothers father, gave him the title
 of earl;  but afterwards he was sixty (5) winters earl.  He breathed
 his last about the end of king Harold Sigurds sons days.  He is buried
 at Christchurch in Birsay, which he let be built.  The earls death was a
 great grief in the Orkneys and in his lands of heritage.  But in those
 lands which he had laid under him with war, then many thought it great thraldom
 to abide under his power.  Then many realms fell away which the earl had
 laid under him, and men looked for trust under those chiefs who were there
 home-born to rule in those realms.  So losses were very soon plainly seen
 when earl Thorfinn fell away.</p>
 
 <p>         These songs were sung about
 the battle between earl Rognvald Brusis son, and earl Thorfinn:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 “Loath am I to tell the story,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 How I witness was when men </p>
 
 <p>                       
 Broke the truce between the earls,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Equal corpses got the corbies:</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Off the isles the mighty monarch</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Tore the seas blue tent in twain,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Storm-cold waters then were stiffened,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Striking ships with buffets sore.</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Hard mishap uprose triumphant</p>
 
 <p>                       
 As the earls in onslaught strove,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Many a man then learnt the lesson</p>
 
 <p>                       
 How to fall in bloody fight;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Hard beneath the headland ruddy</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Hearty friends of ours fought,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Storm of spear-points followed after,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Many mild folk there met grief.</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Gloom oer gleaming sun shall gather,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Earth neath billow black be merged,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Austris burden (6) break to pieces,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Main-sea mount above the mountains;</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Ere among those isles a fairer</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Chieftain shall again be born,</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Thorfinn trusty lord of thanes</p>
 
 <p>                       
 Long may God him guard alive.”</p>
