 <p align="center">BRIAN'S BATTLE.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>154.  Now Flosi rides east to Hornfirth, and most of the men in his
 Thring followed him, and bore his wares east, as well as all his stores and
 baggage which he had to take with him.  After that they busked them for
 their voyage, and fitted out their ship.  Now Flosi stayed by the ship
 until they were "boun."  But as soon as they got a fair wind
 they put out to sea.  They had a long passage and hard weather.  Then
 they quite lost their reckoning.  It happened once that three great seas
 broke over their ship, one after the other.  Then Flosi said they must be
 near some land, and that this was a groundswell.  A great mist was on
 them, but the wind rose so that a great gust overtook them.  They scarce knew
 where they were before they were dashed on shore at dead of night, and there
 the men were saved, but the ship was dashed all to pieces, and they could not
 save their goods.  Then they had to look for shelter and warmth for
 themselves.  The day after they went up on a height.  The weather was
 then good.  Flosi asked if any man knew this land, and there were two men
 of their crew who had fared thither before, and said they were quite sure they
 knew it, and, say they, "We are come to Hrossey in the Orkneys." 
 "Then we might have made a better landfall," said Flosi, "for
 Grim and Helgi, Njal's sons, whom I slew, were in earl Sigurd Hlodver's son's
 bodyguard."  Then they sought for a hiding place, and spread moss
 over themselves, and so lay for a while, but not for long, ere Flosi spoke, and
 said, "We will not lie here so any longer until the landsmen are aware of
 us."  Then they arose and took counsel.  Then Flosi said to his
 men, "We will go all of us and give ourselves up to the earl;  for there
 is naught else to do, and the earl has our lives at his pleasure if he chooses
 to seek for them."  Then they all went away thence.  Flosi said
 that they must tell no man any tidings of their voyage or doings before he told
 them to the earl.  Then they walked on until they met men who showed them
 to the homestead.  Then they went in before the earl, and Flosi and all
 the others hailed him.  The earl asked what men they might be, and Flosi
 told his name, and said out of what part of Iceland he was.  The earl had
 already heard of the Burning, and so he knew the men at once.   
 Then the earl asked Flosi, "What hast thou to tell me about Helgi Njal's
 son, my henchman."  "This," said Flosi, "that I hewed
 off his head."  "Take them all," said the earl.  Then
 that was done.  Just then in came Thorstein, son of Hall of the
 Side.  Flosi had to wife Steinvora, Thorstein's sister.  Thorstein
 was one of earl Sigurd's bodyguard.  But when he saw Flosi seized and
 held, he went in before the earl, and offered for Flosi all the goods he
 had.  The earl was very wrath a long time, but at last the end of it was,
 by the prayer of good men and true, joined to those of Thorstein, for he was
 well backed by friends, and many threw in their word with his, that the earl
 took an atonement from them, and gave Flosi and all the rest of them
 peace.  The earl held to that custom of mighty men that Flosi took that
 place in his service which Helgi Njal's son had filled.  So Flosi was made
 earl Sigurd's henchman, and he soon won his way to great love with the earl.</p>
 
 <p>155.  Those messmates Kari and Kolbein the black put out to sea from
 Eyrar half a month later than Flosi and his companions from Hornfirth. 
 They got a fine fair wind, and were but a short time out.  The first land
 they made was the Fair isle, it lies between Shetland and the Orkneys. 
 There that man whose name was David the white took Kari into his house; 
 he tells him all that he had heard for certain about the doings of the
 Burners.  He was one of Kari's greatest friends, and Kari stayed with him
 for the winter.  Then they heard tidings from the west out of the Orkneys
 of all that was done there.  Earl Sigurd bade to his feast at Yule earl
 Gilli, his brother in law, out of the Southern Isles;  he had to wife
 Swanlauga, (1) earl Sigurd's sister.  Then too came to see earl Sigurd
 that king from Ireland whose name was Sigtrygg.  He was a son of Olaf
 rattle, but his mother's name was Kormlada.  She was the fairest of all
 women, and best gifted in everything that was not in her own power, but it was
 the talk of men that she did all things ill over which she had any power.
 (2)  Brian was the name of the king who first had her to wife, but they
 were then parted.  He was the best natured of all kings.  He had his
 seat in Ireland at Kincora.  His brother's name was Wolf the quarrelsome,
 the greatest champion and warrior;  Brian's foster-child's name was
 Kerthialfad.  He was the son of king Kylfi, who had many wars with king
 Brian, and fled away out of the land before him, and became a hermit.  But
 when king Brian went south on a pilgrimage, then he met king Kylfi, and they
 were atoned.    Then king Brian took his son Kerthialfad to him,
 and loved him more than his own sons.  He was then full grown when these
 things happened, and was the boldest of men.  Duncan was the name of the
 first of king Brian's sons;  the second was Margad;  the third, Takt,
 whom we call Tann, he was the youngest of them;  but the elder sons of
 king Brian were full grown, and the briskest of men.  Kormlada was not the
 mother of king Brian's children, and so grim had she got againt king Brian
 after their parting, that she would gladly have him dead.  King Brian
 thrice forgave all his outlaws the same fault but if they misbehaved themselves
 oftener, then he let them be judged by the law;  and from this one may
 mark what a king he must have been.  Kormlada egged on her son Sigtrygg
 very much to kill king Brian.  She now sent him to earl Sigurd to beg for
 help.  King Sigtrygg came before Yule to the Orkneys, and there, too, came
 earl Gilli, as was written before.  Men were so placed that king Sigtrygg
 sat on a high seat in the middle, but on either side of the king sat one of the
 earls.  The men of king Sigtrygg and earl Gilli sat on the inner side away
 from him, but on the outer side away from earl Sigurd, sat Flosi and Thorstein,
 son of Hall of the Side, and the whole hall was full.  Now king Sigtrygg
 and earl Gilli wished to hear of those tidings which had happened at the
 Burning, and so, also, what had befallen since.  Then Gunnar Lambi's son was
 got to tell the tale, and a stool was set for him to sit upon.</p>
 
 <p>156.  Just at that very time Kari and Kolbein and David the white came
 to Hrossey unawares to all men.  They went straightway up on land, but a
 few men watched the ship.  Kari and his fellows went straight to the
 earl's homestead, and came to the hall about drinking time.  It so
 happened that just then Gunnar was telling the story of the Burning, but they
 were listening to him meanwhile outside.  This was on Yule day
 itself.  Now king Sigtrygg asked, "How did Skarphedinn, bear the
 burning?"  "Well at first for a long time," said Gunnar,
 "but still the end of it was that he wept."  And he went on
 giving an unfair leaning through all the story, but every now and then he lied
 outright.  Kari could not stand this.  Then he ran in with his sword
 drawn, and sang this song: ---</p>
 
 <p>         "Men of might in
 battle eager,</p>
 
 <p>         Boast of burning Njal's
 abode, </p>
 
 <p>         Have the princes heard how
 sturdy</p>
 
 <p>         Seahorse racers sought
 revenge?</p>
 
 <p>         Hath not since, on foemen
 holding</p>
 
 <p>         High the shield's broad orb
 aloft,</p>
 
 <p>         All that wrong been fully
 wroken?</p>
 
 <p>         Raw flesh ravens got to
 tear."</p>
 
 <p>So he ran in up the hall, and smote Gunnar Lambi's son on the neck with such
 a sharp blow, that his head spun off on to the board before the king and the
 earls, and the board was all one gore of blood, and the earl's clothing
 too.  Earl Sigurd knew the man that had done the deed, and called out,
 "Seize Kari and kill him."  Kari had been one of earl Sigurd's
 bodyguard, and he was of all men most beloved by his friends;  and no man
 stood up a whit more for the earl's speech.  "Many would say,
 Lord," said Kari, "that I have done this deed on your behalf, to
 avenge your henchman."  Then Flosi said, "Kari hath not done
 this without a cause;  he is in no atonement with us, and he only did what
 he had a right to do."  So Kari walked away, and there was no hue and
 cry after him.  Kari fared to his ship, and his fellows with him. 
 The weather was then good, and they sailed at once south to Caithness, and went
 on shore at Thraswick to the house of a worthy man whose name was Skeggi, and
 with him they stayed a very long while.  Those behind in the Orkneys
 cleansed the board, and bore out the dead man.  The earl was told that they
 had set sail south for Scotland.  King Sigtrygg said, "This was a
 mighty bold fellow, who dealt his stroke so stoutly, and never thought twice
 about it!"  Then earl Sigurd answered, "There is no man like
 Kari for dash and daring."  Now Flosi undertook to tell the story of
 the Burning and he was fair to all;  and therefore what he said was
 believed.  Then king Sigtrygg stirred in his business with earl Sigurd,
 and egged him on to go to the war with him against king Brian.  The earl
 was long steadfast but the end of it was that he said it might come
 about.  He said he must have his mother's hand for his help, and be king
 in Ireland, if they slew Brian.  But all his men besought earl Sigurd not
 to go into the war, but it was all no good.  So they parted on the
 understanding that earl Sigurd gave his word to go;  but king Sigtrygg
 promised him his mother and the kingdom.  It was so settled that earl
 Sigurd was to come with all his host to Dublin by Palm Sunday.  Then king
 Sigtrygg fared south to Ireland, and told his mother Kormlada that the earl had
 undertaken to come, and also what he had pledged himself to grant him. 
 She shewed herself well pleased at that, but said they must gather greater
 force still.  Sigtrygg asked whence this was to be looked for?  She
 said there were two vikings lying off the west of Man;  and they had
 thirty ships, and "they are men of such hardihood that nothing can
 withstand them.  The one's name is Ospak, and the other's Brodir. 
 Thou shalt fare to find them, and spare nothing to get them into thy quarrel,
 whatever price they ask."  Now king Sigtrygg fares and seeks the
 vikings, and found them lying outside off Man;  king Sigtrygg brings
 forward his errand at once, but Brodir shrank from helping him until he, king
 Sigtrygg, promised him the kingdom and his mother, and they were to keep this
 such a secret that earl Sigurd should know nothing about it;  Brodir too
 was to come to Dublin on Palm Sunday.  King Sigtrygg fared home to his
 mother, and told her how things stood.  After that those brothers, Ospak
 and Brodir, talked together, and then Brodir told Ospak all that he and
 Sigtrygg had spoken of, and bade him fare to battle with him against king
 Brian, and said he set much store on his going.  Ospak said he would not
 fight against so good a king.  Then they were both wrath, and sundered
 their band at once.  Ospak had ten ships and Brodir had twenty. 
 Ospak was a heathen, and the wisest of all men.  He laid his ships inside
 in a sound, but Brodir lay outside him.  Brodir had been a Christian man
 and a mass-deacon by consecration, but he had thrown off his faith and become
 God's dastard, and now worshipped heathen fiends, and he was of all men most
 skilled in sorcery.  He had that coat of mail on which no steel would
 bite.  He was both tall and strong, and had such long locks that he tucked
 them under his belt.  His hair was black.</p>
 
 <p>157.  It so happened one night that a great din passed over Brodir and
 his men, so that they all woke, and sprang up and put on their clothes. 
 Along with that came a shower of boiling blood.  Then they  covered
 themselves with their shields, but for all that many were scalded.  This
 wonder lasted all till day, and a man had died on board every ship.  Then
 they slept during the day.  The second night there was again a din, and
 again they all sprang up.  Then swords leapt out of their sheaths, and
 axes and spears flew about in the air and fought.  The weapons pressed
 them so hard that they had to shield themselves, but still many were wounded,
 and again a man died out of every ship.  This wonder lasted all till
 day.  Then they slept again the day after.  The third night there was
 a din of the same kind.  Then ravens flew at them, and it seemed to them
 as though their beaks and claws were of iron.  The ravens pressed them so
 hard that they had to keep them off with their swords, and covered themselves
 with their shields.  This went on again till day, and then another man had
 died in every ship.  Then they went to sleep first of all, but when Brodir
 work up, he drew his breath painfully, and bade them put off the boat. 
 "For," he said, "I would go to see Ospak."  Then he
 got into the boat and some men with him.  But when he found Ospak he told
 him of the wonders which had befallen them, and bade him say what he thought
 they boded.  Ospak would not tell him before he pledged him peace, and
 Brodir promised him peace but Ospak still shrank from telling him till night
 fell. (3)  Then Ospak still shrank and said ---" When blood rained on
 you, therefore shall ye shed many men's blood, both of your own and
 others.  But when ye heard a great din, then ye must have been shewn the
 crack of doom, and ye shall all die speedily.  But when weapons fought
 against you, that must forbode a battle;  but when ravens pressed you,
 that marks the devils which ye put faith in, and who will drag you all down to
 the pains of hell."  Then Brodir was so wroth that he could answer
 never a word.  But he went at once to his men, and made them lay his ships
 in a line across the sound, and moor them by bearing cables on shore, and meant
 to slay them all next morning.  Ospak saw all their plan.  Then he
 vowed to take the true faith and to go to king Brian, and follow him till his
 deathday.  Then he took that counsel to lay his ships in a line, and punt them
 along the shore with poles, and cut the cables of Brodir's ships.  Then
 the ships of Brodir's men began to fall aboard of one another.  But they
 were all fast asleep;  and then Ospak and his men got out of the firth,
 and so west to Ireland, and came to Kincora.  Then Ospak told king Brian
 all that he had learnt, and took baptism, and gave himself over into the king's
 hand.  After that king Brian made them gather force over all his realm,
 and the whole host was to come to Dublin in the week before Palm Sunday.</p>
 
 <p>158.    Earl Sigurd Hlodver's son busked himself from the
 Orkneys, and Flosi offered to go with him.  The earl would not have that,
 since he had his pilgrimage to fulfil.  Flosi offered fifteen men of his
 band to go on the voyage, and the earl accepted them, but Flosi fared with earl
 Gilli to the southern isles.  Thorstein, the son of Hall of the Side, went
 along with earl Sigurd and Hrafn the red, and Erling of Straumey.  He
 would not that Hareck should go, but said he would be sure to tell him first
 the tidings of his voyage.  The earl came with all his host on Palm Sunday
 to Dublin, and there too was come Brodir with all his host.  Brodir tried
 by sorcery how the fight would go.  But the answer ran thus, that if the
 fight were on Good Friday king Brian would fall but win the day;  but if
 they fought before, they would all fall who were against him.  Then Brodir
 said that they must not fight before the Friday.  Then on the fifth day of
 the week a man rode up to Kormlada and her company on an apple-gray horse, and
 in his hand he held a halberd;  he talked long with them.  King Brian
 came with all his host to the burg, and on the Friday the host fared out of the
 burg, and both armies were drawn up in array.  Brodir was on one wing of the
 battle, but king Sigtrygg on the other.  Earl Sigurd was in the mid
 battle. Now it must be told of king Brian that he would not fight on the
 fastday, and so a shieldburg (4) was thrown round him, and his host was drawn
 up in array in front of it.  Wolf the quarrelsome was on that wing of the
 battle against which Brodir stood.  But on the other wing, were Sigtrygg
 stood against them, were Ospak and his sons.  But in mid-battle was
 Kerthialfad, and before him the banners were borne.  Now the wings fall on
 one another, and there was a very hard fight.  Brodir went through the
 host of the foe, and felled all the foremost that stood there, but no steel
 would bite on him.  Wolf the quarrelsome turned then to meet him, and
 thrust at him twice so hard that Brodir fell before him at each thrust, and was
 well-night not getting on his feet again.  But as soon as ever he found
 his feet, he fled away into the wood at once.  Earl Sigurd had a hard
 battle against Kerthialfad, and Kerthialfad came on so fast that he laid low all
 who were in the front rank, and he broke the array of earl Sigurd right up to
 his banner, and slew the bannerbearer.  Then he got another man to bear
 the banner, and there was again a hard fight.  Kerthialfad smote this man
 to his death at once, and so on one after the other all who stood near
 him.  Then earl Sigurd called on Thorstein, the son of Hall of the Side,
 to bear the banner, and Thorstein was just about to lift the banner, but then
 Amundi the white said, "Don't bear the banner!  for all they who bear
 it get their death."  "Hrafn the red!"  called out
 earl Sigurd, "Bear thou the banner."  "Bear thine own devil
 thyself," answered Hrafn.  Then the earl said "Tis fittest that
 the beggar should bear the bag;"  and with that he took the banner
 from the staff and put it under his cloak.  A little after Amundi the
 white was slain, and then the earl was pierced through with a spear. 
 Ospak had gone through all the battle on his wing, he had been sore wounded,
 and lost both his sons ere king Sigtrygg fled before him.  Then flight
 broke out throughout all the host.  Thorstein Hall of the Side's son stood
 still while all the others fled, and tied his shoestring.  Then
 Kerthialfad asked why he ran not as the others.  "Because," said
 Thorstein, "I can't get home tonight, since I am at home out in
 Iceland."  Kerthialfad gave him peace.  Hrafn the red was chased
 out into a certain river;  he thought he saw there the pains of hell down
 below him and he thought the devils wanted to drag him to them.  Then
 Hrafn said, "Thy dog, (5) Apostle Peter! hath run twice to Rome, and he
 would run a third time if thou gavest him leave."  Then the devils
 let him loose, and Hrafn got across the river.  Now Brodir saw that king
 Brian's men were chasing the fleers, and that there were few men by the
 Shieldburg.  Then he rushed out of the wood, and broke through the
 shieldburg, and hewed at the king.  The lad Takt threw his arm in the way,
 and the stroke took it off and the king's head too, but the king's blood came
 on the lad's stump, and the stump was healed by it on the spot.  Then
 Brodir called out with a loud voice, "Now man can tell man that Brodir
 felled Brian."  Then men ran after those who were chasing the fleers,
 and they were told that king Brian had fallen, and then they turned back straightway,
 both Wolf the quarrelsome and Kerthialfad.  Then they threw a ring round
 Brodir and his men, and threw branches of trees upon them, and so Brodir was
 taken alive.  Wolf the quarrelsome cut open his belly, and led him round
 and round the trunk of a tree, and so wound all his entrails out of him, and he
 did not die before they were all drawn out of him.  Brodir's men were
 slain to a man.  After that they took king Brian's body and laid it
 out.  The king's head had grown to the trunk.  Fifteen men of the
 Burners fell in Brian's battle, and there too fell Halldor the son of Gudmund
 the powerful, and Erling of Straumey.  On Good Friday that event happened
 in Caithness that a man whose name was Daurrud went out.  He saw folk
 riding twelve together to a bower, and there they were all lost to his
 sight.  He went to the bower.  He looked in through a window slit
 that was in it and saw that there were women inside, and they had set up a
 loom.  Men's heads were the weights, but men's entrail's were the warp and
 weft.  A sword served for a shuttle, and the reels were arrows.  They
 sang these songs, but he learnt them by heart --</p>
 
 <p>THE WOOF OF WAR</p>
 
 <p>"See!  warp is stretched</p>
 
 <p>For warriors' fall,</p>
 
 <p>Lo!  weft in loom</p>
 
 <p>'Tis wet with blood;</p>
 
 <p>Now fight foreboding,</p>
 
 <p>'Neath friends' swift fingers,</p>

 <p>Now mount we our horses,</p>
 
 <p>Now bare we our brands, </p>
 
 <p>Now haste we hard, maidens,</p>
 
 <p>Hence far, far, away."</p>
 
 <p>         </p>
 
 <p>         Then they plucked down the
 woof and tore it asunder, and each kept what she had hold of.  Now Daurrud
 goes away from the slit, and home;  but they got on thier steeds and rode
 six to the south, and the other six to the north.  A like event befell
 Brand Gneisti's son in the Faroe isles.  At Swinefell, in Iceland, blood
 came on the priest's stole on Good Friday, so that he had to put it off. 
 At Thvattwater the priest thought he saw on Good Friday a deep of the sea hard
 by the altar, and there he saw many awful sights, and it was long ere he could
 sing the hours.  This even happened in the Orkneys, that Hareck thought he
 saw earl Sigurd, and some men with him.  Then Hareck took his horse and
 rode to meet the earl.  Men saw that they met and rode under a brae, but
 they were never seen again, and not a scrap was ever found of Hareck. 
 Earl Gilli in the Southern isles dreamed that a man came to him and said his
 name was Hostfinn, and told him he was come from Ireland.  The earl
 thought he asked him for tidings thence, and then he sang this song.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>"I have been were warriors wrestled,</p>
 
 <p>High in Erin sang the sword,</p>
 
 <p>Ross to boss met many bucklers,</p>
 
 <p>Steel run sharp on rattling helm;</p>
 
 <p>I can tell of all their struggle;</p>
 
 <p>Sigurd fell in flight of spears; </p>
 
 <p>Brian fell, but kept his kingdom</p>
 
 <p>Ere he lost one drop of blood."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         Those two, Flosi and the
 earl, talked much of this dream.  A week after, Hrafn the red came
 thither, and told them all the tidings of Brian's battle, the fall of the king
 and of earl Sigurd, and Brodir, and all the vikings.  "What,"
 said Flosi, "hast thou to tell me of my men?"  "They all
 fell there," says Hrafn, "but thy brother in law Thorstein took peace
 from Kerthialfad, and is now with him."  Flosi says to the earl that
 he would now go away, "for we have our pilgrimage south to
 fulfill."  The earl bade him go as he wished, and gave him a ship and
 all else that he needed, and much silver.  Then they sailed to Wales, and
 stayed there a while.</p>
 
 <p>159.    Kari, Solmund's son, told master Skeggi that he
 wished he would get him a ship.  So master Skeggi gave Kari a longship,
 fully trimmed and manned, and on board it went Kari, and David the white, and
 Kolbein the black.  Now Kari and his fellows sailed south off Scotland's
 firths, and there they found men from the Southern isles.  They told Kari
 the tidings from Ireland, and also that Flosi was gone to Wales, and his men
 with him.  But when Kari heard that he told his messmates that he would
 hold on south to Wales, to fall in with Flosi and his band.  He bade them
 then to part from his company, if they liked it better, and said that he would
 not wish to beguile any man into mischief, because he thought he had not yet
 had revenge enough on them for his wrongs.  All chose to go with
 him.  Then he sails south to Wales, and there they lay in hiding in a
 creek out of the way.  That morning Kol Thorstein's son went into the town
 to buy silver.  He of all the burners had used the bitterest words. 
 Kol had talked much with a mighty dame, and he had so knocked the nail on the
 head, that it was all but fixed that he was to have her, and settle down
 there.  That same morning Kari went also into the town.  He came up
 when Kol was telling the silver.  Kari knew him, and ran at him with drawn
 sword and smote him on the neck.  But he still went on telling the silver,
 and his head counted "ten" just as it spun off the body.  Kari
 said, "Go and tell this to Flosi, that Kari Solmund's son hath slain Kol
 Thorstein's son.  I give notice of this slaying as done by my
 hand."  Then Kari went to his ship, and told his shipmates of the
 manslaughter.  Then they sailed north to Beruwick, and laid up their ship,
 and fared up into Whitherne in Scotland, and were with earl Malcolm that
 year.  But when Flosi heard of Kol's slaying, he laid out his body, and
 bestowed much money on his burial.  Flosi never uttered any wrathful words
 against Kari.  Thence Flosi fared south across the sea and began his
 pilgrimage, and went on south, and did not stop till he came to Rome. 
 There he got so great honour that he took absolution from the Pope himself, and
 for that he gave a great sum of money.  Then he fared back again by the
 east road, and stayed long in towns, and went in before mighty men, and had
 from them great honour.  He was in Norway the winter after, and took a
 ship from earl Eric to sail out, and he gave him much meal, and many other men
 behaved handsomely to him.  Now he sailed out to Iceland, and ran into Hornfirth,
 and thence fared home to Swinefell.  He had then fulfilled all the terms
 of his atonement, both in fines and foreign travel.</p>
 
 <p>160.     Now it is to be told of Kari that the summer
 after he went down to his ship and sailed south across the sea, and began his
 pilgrimage in Normandy.  And went south and got absolution and fared back
 by the western way, and took his ship again in Normandy, and sailed in her
 north across the sea to Dover in England.  Thence he sailed west, round
 Wales, and so north, off Scotland's firths, and did not stay his course till he
 came to Thraswick in Caithness, to master Skeggi's house.  Then he gave
 over the ship of burden to Kolbein and David.  Kolbein sailed in that ship
 to Norway, but David stayed behind in the Fair isle.  Kari was that winter
 in Caithness.  In this winter his housewife died out in Iceland.  The
 next summer Kari busked him for Iceland.  Skeggi gave him a ship of
 burden, and there were eighteen of them on board her.  They were rather
 late "boun," but still they put to sea, and had a long passage, but
 at last they made Ingolf's-head.  There their ship was dashed all to
 pieces, but the men's lives were saved.  Then, too, a snow-storm came on
 them.  Now they ask Kari what counsel shall be taken;  but he said
 their best plan was to go to Swinefell and put Flosi's manhood to the
 proof.  Now they went right up to Swinefell in the storm.  Flosi was
 in the sitting room.  He knew Kari as soon as ever he came into the room,
 and sprang up to meet him, and kissed him, and sat him down in the high seat by
 his side.  Flosi asked Kari to be there that winter, and Kari took his
 offer.  Then they were atoned with a full atonement.  Then Flosi gave
 away his brother's daughter Hildigunna, whom Hauskuld the priest of Whiteness
 had had to wife to Kari.  They dwelt first at Broadwater.  Men say
 that the end of Flosi's life was, that he fared abroad, when he had grown old,
 to seek for timber to build him a hall;  and he was in Norway that
 winter;  but the next summer he was late "boun."  Men told
 him that his ship was not seaworthy.  Flosi said she was good enough for
 an old and "fey" man, and bore his goods shipboard and put out to
 sea.  But of that ship no tidings were ever heard.  These were the children
 of Kari Solmud's son and Helga Njal's daughter --- Thorgerda and Ragneida,
 Valgerda, and Thord who was burnt in Njal's house.  But the children of
 Hildigunna and Kari were these, Starkad, and Thord, and Flosi.  The son of
 Burning-Flosi was Kolbein, who had been the most famous man of any of that
 stock.  And here we end the story of Burnt Njal.</p>
