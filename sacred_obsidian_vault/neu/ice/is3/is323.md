 <p>E. --- THE STORY OF HEMING.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>         Harold the son of Sigurd
 Swine then ruled over Norway when this Saga was made;  he was king over
 Norway twenty winters;  he had two winters on to forty when he became
 king.  He had to wife Ellisif, daughter of Jaroslaf, king in Novgorod, he
 left her there behind him when he fared to Norway, and said he would send and
 fetch her ere fifteen winters were spent;  he left behind with her a skin
 flayed from the biggest he goat full of gold and pure silver, and tells her she
 was to have that for her own if he did not come back, or if he were lost. 
 Each of them swore to the other oaths of faithfulness.  Their daughter's
 name was Maria, who has been the fairest woman in Norway.  Now after Harold
 became king over Norway then he took him a wife and got Thora, daughter of
 Thorberg Arni's son and Ragnhilda, daughter of Erling Skjalg's son of
 Sole;  their son hight Magnus, the father of Hacon the foster-child of
 Thorir of Steig.  He was five ells high and the most courteous of
 men;  a mighty warrior and the wisest of men.  He had many brisk men
 with him;  Nicholas his brother in law, the son of Thorberg, was the most
 esteemed.  There were also Icelanders with the king.  Bodvar and
 Asbjorn, the sons of Eldjarn, the son of Arnor carline-nose;  and Odd
 Ofeig's son;  Finn Kjartan's son and Thorarin Nefjulf's son;  these
 all were well esteemed by the king.  It was his wont to fare to feasts
 over the land in time of peace.</p>
 
 <p>2.      It chanced one autumn that the king went to
 a feast in Helgeland;  he went to the house of a freeman hight Aslak with
 one hundred men.  That was at the homestead called Torgir.  Aslak was
 a sage in wit and a great chief in Torgir.  Bjorn was his son's name, a
 tall man and strong.  At that feast the king sits three nights;  the
 feast was of the best.  It was served in a hall, and it ws all decked in
 the upper part with shields and war-gear, and there were many sports;  and
 all who were there said they had never accepted a better feast.   
 And the second day of the feast just after the mass had been sung, the king
 calls Aslak the goodman (to him).  Then the king said, "Pray are the
 laws known to thee which the king Saint Olaf my brother, set up;  thou art
 said to be much of a lawyer."  Aslak answers, "I am not able to
 say much about that."  The king answers, "Whereabouts is it in
 the law about a man if he brings up his son in secret?"  Aslak
 answers, "That is not known to me that a man shall not bring up his
 children just as he will."  "It stands another way in my
 book" said the king.  "What is that" answers Aslak; 
 the king answers, "Whoever does so has forfeited goods and
 peace."  "Why" answers Aslak, "shall such hard measure
 be dealt him."  The king answers, "He may not defend the land on
 the king's side who is concealed;  and he may also plot secret treason
 against the king who is hidden."  "That cannot be laid at my
 door" says Aslak.  "Nicholas Thorberg's son told it me"
 says the king.  Aslak answers, "Say'st thou that Nicholas?" 
 He answers, "Tis hard for me to lay a lie at the king's door, when after
 all I have said something about it;  I mind this that I was here at Torgir
 ten winters old, and many men called me rather stout for my years, but thou
 hadst a son hight Heming six winters old, and we two played at childish games,
 and he was in everything stronger than I, and I never saw any one his
 match;  I left him behind me here;  and since I have never heard of
 him;  and now that was all I said to the king."  The king asked,
 "Where is that man now?"  Aslak answers, "Sooth it is that
 Nicholas says, that I had a son hight Heming.  And when he was seven
 months old he lost his wits, and after that  sent him to the Finns, and
 since I have never heard of him, and I know not whether he be alive or
 dead."  The king answers, "We will fare away hence now; 
 but next year at this time thou shalt let thy son be come hither whether he
 have more or less wit;  and though he be dead then I will see his
 bones."  "As for that," answers Aslak, "I ween I shall
 not be able to do it."  And now they part for that time, and the king
 fares away.  But at the same season in the next autumn the king goes to
 the feast at Torgir to Aslak's house, and did not lack a good banquet. 
 And when one night was spent then Aslak was called to the king.  Then the
 king said, "Mindest thou Aslak what we spoke about the last time I was
 here?"  Aslak answers "I have not thought about it." 
 The king said, "Here should now be come thy son, him whom thou hast long
 kept hid."  Alsak answers, "I have never paid any heed to it,
 and I cannot get him brought hither now."  The king said, "I
 will not lay on thee such strong wrath as thou art worthy of;  we will
 fare away hence and be away two months;  after that I will come here, and
 then let thy son Heming be come hither."  Aslak says, "You have
 no need to show so much passion on this for I will willingly do your
 bidding."  All men see a very wrathful look on the king's face and so
 they parted for that time.  And when that time was passed which the king
 had laid down, he came to Torgir.  Aslak had then got ready for a feast
 and greeted the king most kindly.  The king said to Aslak, "Is thy
 son Heming now here?"  Aslak says, "Again I have paid no heed to
 your words."  The king said, "Send thou for him no sooner than
 thou likest;  but here we will stay till he comes, or till thy stores fail
 thee;  then thou wilt make no more feasts, or thy son Bjorn."
 "That is in thy power," says Aslak.  Now they part for that time.</p>
 
 <p>3.            Aslak
 calls to him a man called Kalf.  "Thou shalt" says Aslak
 "get on board ship at once and fourteen men with thee, and fare north to
 Snasar, and land at the place called Framness.  There thou shalt go on
 land with four men.  There thou wilt fall on a little path in the
 wood;  that path will get broader and broader as ye fare futher along
 it.  Ye must fare four days, and ye shall still fare on the fourth day
 till even.  Then there will be before you a dale shut in between crags and
 woods, so that ye cannot see the dale till ye come up to it.  Then you
 will see a cottage;  go up to it.  There you will find no more folk
 than a man and a woman;  tell him the truth as to whence and what ye
 are.  There ye shall be that night.  One of you shall watch, and that
 man shalt be thou.  Thou wilt see a man come into the cot and rather
 big.  I do not hide from you that he is not so silly as I have told the
 king.  Then thou shalt stand up Kalf, and greet Heming;  and tell him
 my message, and beg him to fare home to me.  But if he does not yield
 quickly, then bid him do as he pleases;  but tell him that my life is at
 stake and my son Bjorn's.  But methinks there is more hope that he will
 get to come somehow.  But tell him still that his life is at stake, if he
 comes, if it be so as I ween.  Bid him choose that course which he thinks
 best."  After that he bids them farewell.  Then they fared on
 the way which was pointed out to them, and came at last to the house of the
 carle;  and they were well treated, as soon as the carle knew whence they
 were.  They went to bed at night all but Kalf, he was in a hidden
 spot;  but they the master and mistress sit up by the fire.  Then the
 carline said, "Methinks our foster child is late in coming
 home."  The carle said, "All the goods that I have I would give
 that he might not come home this week."  "What is at the bottom
 of that," says the carline.  The carle answers, "I am afraid
 that these men have come to take Heming away."  "I don't
 know" said the carline "which way I should turn if I have to part with
 my foster child."  "I should be well content" says the
 carle "if I knew that he would take the better course;  but I very
 much doubt that I shall have to part with him."</p>
 
 <p>4.            They
 had not long to wait ere a man comes in a red kirtle, and he had a fillet of
 gold round his brow, but his hair lay down on his shoulders.  Kalf thought
 he had never seen a bigger or a brisker man.  They stand up and greet
 their foster child Heming.  Heming asks what had come.  The carline
 says, "Men have come from thy father, and we two are afraid that they have
 come after thee."  Heming says, "It must be said that they have
 not come too soon."  Kalf stands up and greets Heming, and tells him
 that his father sends him a message, and along with it "that he begged
 thee to come home."  "There must be something great when a
 message has to be sent to me and I will not go."  Kalf answers,
 "I have no need to hide from thee that he bade thee settle for
 thyself," and then he tells him what his father had said.  Heming
 answers, "Go away in the morning;  ye have no need to bide for me, if
 I do not come."  Then they slept out the night.  But in the
 morning they fared to their ship.  And then when they were ready to sail
 they saw where Heming was, running down the country on snow-shoon, and he gets
 on shipboard with them.  Kalf asked "When didst thou leave
 home?"  "This morn" says Heming.  Nothing is told of
 their doings before they get to Torgir.  It was then so far on in the
 morning that men were going to prayers.  But after prayers when the king
 had taken his seat, Heming went in before the king and hailed him.  The
 king took his greeting well, and asked who he might be.  Heming told his
 name.  "Well!" said the king "I would not care to see the
 hide of which thou art one of the shanks."  Heming answers,
 "Every one is not as he is called;  but I am come hither because I
 wished to offer you all things in which I can be of service to you, and which
 you will take of me, though there is little furtherance in me;  but all
 that I may, and all that I can do, will I offer to get peace for my
 father;  but if you had it in your mind to kill me, then I will not flee
 from that."  The king answers, "Art thou any man for feats of
 strength."  Heming answers, "So that carle and carline thought
 who brought me up, as though I knew some feats;  but you will think them
 little or nothing;  but if I am to pick out one before the rest, then I
 think I may tell you of one."  The king asks, "What is
 that?"  Heming answers, "On snow-shoon I care not with whom I strive." 
 The king answers, "I will first see thy sports, and know what worth there
 may be in them."  Heming answers, "You must let others play
 first, but I will try to play after them."</p>
 
 <p>5.            Then
 the king goes out of doors with his men.  The isle was much overgrown with
 wood.  The king goes to the wood;  he sets a spear on its point down
 into the field, but the shaft stood up.  The king took a bow, and shot an
 arrow up into the air.  The arrow turned in the air and came down in the
 middle of the spearshaft, and the arrow stood up straight in the air out of
 it.  Heming laid an arrow on the string, and shot it up into the air, and
 it came down into the notch of the king's arrow.  Then the king takes the
 spear, and hurls it both far and true, so that all men spoke about it. 
 The king bade Heming to hurl after him;  Heming did so;  and hurled
 just so far beyond him that the felloe of the point of his spear lay on the
 point of the king's spear.  Now the king takes the spear a second time,
 and hurls it beyond Heming's spear by a whole shaft's length.  Then Heming
 said "I need not hurl after for I cannot reach up to this
 throw."  The king said, "Thou shalt hurl, and along with it have
 the boldness to hurl farther, if thou canst."  Then Heming hurled and
 far beyond the king's shot.  The king took a knife and stuck it into a
 log, and shot down into the haft of the knife, so that the arrow stood fast in
 it.  Then Heming took his arrows.  The king said, "Thou art a
 mighty famous man Heming, when thou hast thy arrows bound with
 gold."  Heming answers, "They were given to me, but I did not
 let them be made, and I have not taken my garb from them."  Heming
 shoots after the king, and struck the haft of the knife, and split it asunder,
 but the point of the arrow stuck in the tang of the blade which went into the
 haft.  The king said, "Now we two will shoot further," and takes
 an arrow, and was very wrath;  the king drew his bow so that the tips seem
 to come together.  The arrow struck a little twig very slender.  Then
 all said that this was the most famous shot.  Then Heming shot someway
 further, and the point pierced a nut.  This all wondered at who were
 by.  Then the king said,  "Now shall be taken another nut and
 lay it on Bjorn's head, thy brother;  and there thou shall strike the nut,
 and yet shoot not less far than before;  but if thou missest, then thy
 life shall be at stake."  Heming said, "You may settle as to my
 life, but this shot I will not shoot."  Bjorn said, "Nay, but thou
 shalt shoot rather than lose thy life, for it belongs to every man to lengthen
 his life while he may."  Heming answers, "Canst thou make up thy
 mind to stand still, and not swerve away, if I shoot at the nut."
  "Without doubt I can," says Bjorn.  Heming answers,
 "Stand by lord, and see what befalls the nut."  The king says,
 "By thee will I stand."  But he bade Odd Ofeig's son to look at
 the shot.  Heming went thither where the king bade him stand and marks
 himself with the cross, and said, "It is known to you that I have no wish
 to do my brother any hurt;  but I lay all the blame on the king if it
 happen otherwise."  After that Heming shot and hit the nut and it
 rolled off Bjorn's head;  but he was not hurt.  The king came up and
 asked, "Whether he had hit the nut?"  Odd said how it had been
 struck.  The king said, "We will now leave off shooting for this
 once, but thou bearest one-sided witness."  Now they go home, and
 sleep out the night.</p>
 
 <p>6.            After
 the morning-draught next day the king goes to sea with his men.  Then the
 king said to Halldor Snorri's son, "I mean thee to overcome Heming today
 in swimming."  Halldor answered, "They must be caught who are
 better able to do that."  Then the king called out Bodvar Eldjarn's
 son.  Bodvar answered "Though I had all the feats of strength of all
 the men who are here I would not for anything try my hand here, and least of
 all, when I know that I fall short of Heming in everything."  Then
 the king spoke to Nicholas Thorberg's son:  "Thou shalt strive in
 swimming with Heming."  Nicholas answers, "I know not how it
 will go;  but I will try if you will."  Then the king ordered
 them both off to swim.  Heming said, "With him will I ratherest try,
 if I am to try my strength with any one."  They take off their
 clothes and set off to swim.  Nicholas asked, "What wilt thou sooner
 try, diving or long-swimming?"  Heming answers, "Then there will
 be a choice of trying diving when thou hast overcome me at the other
 first."  Then Heming struck out thwart away from the land.  And
 when they had swum a long time Nicholas asked "Won't it be wise to turn
 back?"  Heming said, "Further on I thought you king's brothers
 in law must mean to make the turning point of your path."  And when
 they had swum a while, then Nicholas said, "Is thy mind made up, Heming,
 to strike out further?"  "I thought thou wouldst be able to take
 care of thyself though thou rolledst back before the billow;  but I mean
 to fare further."  Nicholas answers, "I must turn
 back."  And so he did.  And when he had not swum long then his
 swimming grew dead;  and when Heming sees that he swam to him, and asked
 "How goes the swimming?"  Nicholas answers, "That is no
 business of thine, so go thy way."  Heming answers, "This has
 served thee right, but still we two will bear one another up together to the land." 
 Nicholas answers, "I will not say nay to that."  Then Nicholas
 laid hold with his hands on his belt.  And so they got both to land. 
 Then Nicholas went on shore;  and he is very weary and stiff.  But
 Heming sat him down on a stone out between high and low water mark, and the
 king asked Nicholas how Heming had behaved in swimming.  Nicholas answers,
 "I had brought no tidings to land had Heming not been a better fellow to
 me than I deserved."  Then the king throws off his clothes.  But
 Aslak goes to find Heming, and said, "Get thee away, and save thyself, for
 the king will have thee dead;  but there is shelter in the
 wood."  "I will fare nowhither," says Heming, "let the
 king come if he will;  'the ernes shall claw one another face to
 face."  Now the king plunges out a swimming, and Heming goes to meet
 him.  The king pulled him under water at once, so that other men could not
 see their struggle.  But the sea was very unquiet over them.  Then it
 began to grow dark at nightfall.  And at last the king struck out for
 land;  he was so wrath that no one dared to speak to him.  No man saw
 Heming, and all thought he was dead;  no one dared to ask after him. 
 The king went home after he had put on his clothes;  there was little
 merriment.  The king was both wrath and mute, but Aslak was rueful with
 grief.  Fires were lit in the hall.  And when all had taken their
 seats then Heming walks into the hall before the king, and lays a strap-knife
 on his knee which the king had had on his neck when he plunged out a swimming. 
 Now all thought they knew that he must have taken the knife (from the king).</p>
 
 <p>7.            Now the
 night passed.  And next morning the king busked him to go away.  He
 said that Heming shall fare with him to the mainland and be with the
 king.  And so it was.  On the land was a high fell.  But their
 road lay forward along the hillside by a byepath.  There were crags sheer
 down below and high fells above;  and the slope was no broader than one
 man might ride on straight along.  The king said, "Now shalt thou
 Heming sport before us on snow-shoon."  Heming said, "Now the
 ground does not lie well for it;  for it is very rough with ice, and there
 is little snow,"  and it was very hard on the fell.  The king
 says there was no feat of skill in running if the going were good.  Heming
 said, "You must have your way."  Heming gets on his snow-shoon
 and runs foward along the slope up and down by turns;  and most men said
 that they had never seen any one run so lightly.  After that he ran to the
 king and said, "I should like to leave off running."  The king
 said, "Thou shalt not run but once more;  thou shalt go across up
 here to the top of the fell, and run straight down and stop thyself, if thou
 canst, at the edge of the crags."  Heming said, "That I see that
 you will have my life, and so you need not put it off any longer." 
 The king answers, "If thou doest not this as I bid thee, then thou shalt
 take death on the spot."  Heming answers,  "There is little
 putting off of death between this and that.  But every man is told to
 lengthen his life while he may, and so I will do."  Then Aslak goes
 before the king and offers him all his property to get Heming peace;  but
 the king he would not have it.  "After all he would not spare me, and
 so he must set off and do this."  Heming prayed that no one would beg
 him off.  And he goes away at once and Odd Ofeig's son with him.  He
 said, In an ill hour here we part with a fine fellow;  and I will show
 thee that I wished thee to live.  And here I have a linen cloth which
 Saint Stephen had before his eyes when he was stoned;  this I will tie
 round thee;  for that I know no living thing since Saint Stephen had the
 cloth, over which it has been thrown, that did not get back its health,
 whatever hurt it may have had.  But if thou runnest over the rocks, and
 art lost, then the cloth is no better than any other linen.  But if life
 is fated to thee, though we two do not meet again, then I will that thou takest
 good care of it, for I do not give it thee."  Heming says, "May be
 that thou wilt not have a good return;  but it shall not be worse than
 none."  After that they parted.  No man knew of their
 converse.  The king goes up on the hill, and all his men.  The king
 had a red kirtle and a scarlet cloak with straps over him, and a spear in his
 hand.  He loosed the straps of his cloak, and drove the point of his spear
 into the earth.  Nicholas Thorberg's son stood at his back, and propped
 him up with his hands round his waist, and so on the rest of them one after the
 other, who stood by.  Now Heming goes up on the fell and gets on his
 snow-shoon, and ran straight down the fell.  He never ran at such a great
 pace that he could not steady himself;  and next of all he came about to
 where the king stood.  But when he came towards the edge of the crags, he
 shook off the straps of his snow-shoon and sprung up into the air, and the
 snow-shoon glide down from the fell, but he came down on his feet at the very
 edge.  He sways about much.  He clutched the king's cloak, but the
 king bowed down his head and strips off the cloak.  Then Heming slides
 down over the rocks.  Then the king said, "There now parted the dead
 and the living."  Odd said, "Ye two would not get the same
 lodging though ye had both died here."  The king said, "What
 lodging dost thou mean that each of us, I and Heming, would have
 had?"  Odd said "Willingly would I get so worthy a lodging as I
 think is in store for Heming;  but I think that Christ could not wish that
 the Fiend should be so glad of thee that he should take thee in this
 evening."  "I may not grant thee less," says the king,
 "than that thou shouldst get that good lodging to which Heming is already
 gone."  And he bids them take him and throw him over the cliff. 
 Then Halldor Snorri's son answers, "Either all we Icelanders who are now
 here will die in one way, or no one of us;  but we will have something to
 show for our lives."  The king said, "It shall be done for thy
 sake Halldor, that Odd shall have peace this winter;  and fare to Iceland
 next summer;  and as soon as he is gone then he shall be made an outlaw
 over all Norway."  Odd says, "Let bygones be bygones;  for
 the king has done well by me in many things;  but I shall think it no
 loss, though now we part here."  Odd fared away at once.  But
 the king fared at once to that feast which was prepared for him.  And we
 have not to speak of him first.  But Odd fared out to Iceland the summer
 after.</p>
 
 <p>8.            Now it
 is to be told of Heming that he dashed down over the rocks;  and he fared,
 as Odd guessed, like those who tumble off crags so that all his clothes blew
 out away from him, but one end of the cloth got caught in a jutting point of
 the rock and held fast.  There hung Heming on the crag, and then knew
 nothing of what had befallen him.  A little after he came to his senses,
 and was all full of fear and dread.  But as his wits grew so fear passed
 from his breast.  Then he spoke to himself thus:  "For this must
 I have caught fast here, than to have placed me here with life and
 health.  Now I will vow this to God that I will share my goods into three
 parts.  A third I will give to the Saint king Olaf, another third to
 pilgrims and poor men;  but the third to Saint Stephen;  and that I
 will give into the hands of Odd Ofeig's son.  For myself I mean to go
 south to Saint Peter, if God lets me come hence.  I pray God this that I
 may stand as close at king Harold's death as he now thought he was to my
 death."  It was then dark night.  He saw a great light over him,
 and a man walking to him down the crag, and he draws him up to him on the
 crag.  He said "Here is come king Olaf Harold's son to find thee and
 to help thee;  for I would not that thou wert lost, so that king Harold's
 guilt might be increased.  But thou shalt keep thy vow to go south.  But
 if thou comest among unknown men then thou shalt call thyself Leif while king
 Harold lives.  That shall also be granted when thou prayedst that thou
 shalt be close by when king Harold dies;  but methinks thou wilt not repay
 me well if thou takest much part in that quarrel."  After that it
 seems to Heming that Saint Olaf the king faded away from him up aloft with the
 light;  but he sees a boat and rows out to Torgir.  He goes to the
 church, and sees many tapers burning, and there at their prayers lay Aslak and
 Bjorn.  Then Bjorn said when he saw Heming come to the church door,
 "Father," says he, "a muckle wonder.  Here is come Heming,
 my brother."  Heming answers, "No wonders are these for I am
 alive as ye see," and tells them all that had happened.  They were
 more glad than tongue can tell.  Heming was there in hiding that
 winter.  But in the spring he shared his goods as he had vowed. 
 After that Heming fared to England, and had with him that third of the goods
 which belonged to Saint Stephen, and caused it to be kept there while he went
 south to Rome.</p>
 
 <p>9.            There
 was a king called Edward who ruled over England;  he was the son of king
 Ethelred, his mother's name was Emma whom Canute the mighty had to wife. 
 The king was a wise man and had many friends.  He had no children. 
 To him Leif came, and the king received him well.  But when he had been
 there a while then he sent word secretly to Odd Ofeig's son that he should come
 to him as soon as he might.  But when Odd heard those tidings then he
 fitted out his ship and sails first to the Orkneys, and so to England, and
 finds Leif there in London, and he welcomed Odd well, and he was there that
 winter.  He let two bells be cast.  Along with that he took the money
 which Heming gave to Saint Stephen for his life, and he also took the
 cloth;  and Heming begged Odd to build a church with the money.  And
 a little while before Odd was boun for sea, he was at a crowded meeting which
 the king held there.  There he saw a tall man in a cloak, with a sword
 garnished with gold in his hand.  Odd went up to this man and asked his
 name;  but he said his name was Adalbrigt.  Odd said, "Whence
 gottest thou these treasures, thy cloak and sword?  for I know that my
 brother owned these precious things, and he sailed from Iceland in a ship, and
 was never heard of since."  He said he had bought those precious
 things.  Leif came up and said "Thou must tell the truth, for the
 king has a sword called 'Touchtine,' and from it thou shalt have a
 stroke.  But that is the nature of it, that it becomes every man's bane
 who lies;  but it will not bite on one who tells the truth." 
 Adalbrigt says, "It will bite on me then, for we were many of us on board
 ship;  and we took a ship;  and those men defended themselves
 manfully, but we murdered them all.  And I do not hide that I am this
 man's bane of whom you speak;  and I will give myself up to God's power
 and yours."  Odd said, "I will not have thy life, but the king
 has power to decide on your stay in the land, but one hundred marks of burnt
 silver shalt thou pay me."  Adalbrigt agrees to this gladly. 
 After that Odd busked him to go;  and he got great honours from the king
 and Leif.  He sails off to sea.  Weather drove him into Norway; 
 and there he made that haven called Eikunda-Sound, and they lay there some
 nights.  One evening late king Harold came there with five ships. 
 The king became aware that Odd had come thither.  It was then dark at
 night.  The king made them lay his ships across the sound further out than
 Odd's ship, and made them lash the ships together;  but he himself had a
 tent on shore, and Odd was shut in.  Men became unhappy.  Odd said,
 "Be not unhappy for I tell you sooth;  Heming is alive, and he had
 got into more risk than we are;  and we will look for our help where he
 looked, and that is where God Almighty is.  I will vow this to let a
 church be built at Mel, as has been prayed me, and to lay out money
 there;  and to make there a monastery, and give to it all the goods which
 we have here on board.  Ye shall all also vow something."  And
 so they did.  And when this was done then the wind fell.  Odd bade
 them heave up the anchor and hoist the sail.  Then a breeze sprang
 up.  They laugh who are on land, and asked whether Oddr meant to sail up
 on land, or out towards the ships.  Oddr steers out over the lashings
 between the ships, and sails away to sea;  and comes with his ship to
 Midfirth, and fared home to Mel, and bade them build a church there;  and
 it was hallowed to Saint Stephen.  And that cloth is still there to this
 day which Heming had about him. (1)</p>
 
 <p>10.       Now we must take up our story and
 say that an earl ruled in Northumberland, hight Guddin (Godwin) Ulfnad's
 son;  he had to wife Ingirid, a daughter of earl Thorgils
 crackle-leg;  she was sister of earl Ulf, the father of king Sweyn. 
 Guddin had many children.  One son of his hight Harold;  he was the
 most courteous of men.  The second hight Tosti;  he was a tall man
 and a strong, scowling-browed, a great man for words, and the most warlike of
 men;  he had not many friends.  The third hight Kari, he was called
 Muru-Kari (Morcar), Valtheof hight the youngest.  But his daughter's name
 was Velgerda;  she was given away to that man hight Aki nicknamed Aki the
 tall;  they were in Scarborough.  One autumn king Edward came to
 Scarborough on horseback.  He rode with a spear which Harold wished
 eagerly to have.  But Tosti his brother hit on that plan, that he takes
 the spearhead from the shaft of his spear, and cuts on it (the shaft) a point
 of wood, and afterwards rides up to the king and said, "See, lord, my
 spear;  it has no iron on it."  The king said, "I see what
 thou wilt, and now I will give thee my spear and this name along with it, that
 thou shalt be called Tosti wooden-spear;  and methinks it more likely that
 thou wilt not lack greed, if thou seest others more powerful than
 thyself."  The king bade Harold to him, and he followed the king, and
 he parted lovingly from his men.  But when the king came home, then he
 showed Harold a seat on the other high-seat by Leif.  "He knows"
 he says, "most feats of skill and strength, and he shall teach thee them
 all."  Harold thanked the king mightily for that.  And Leif took
 all pains to teach Harold such feats, and he alone in England knew all about
 Leif's life.  And when five winters were spent, then Harold fell only
 short of Leif in this one thing that he was not so strong.  And when
 Harold showed his feats before men, then all wondered where he could have
 learnt such craft;  for no one knew that Leif knew so many feats.</p>
 
 <p>Harold was eighteen year old when he fared out of England west to France
 with twelve ships.  There Robert the Rouen-earl ruled the land;  he
 had a son high William, and he was called the bastard;  he bade Harold to
 his house;  he was taller in growth than most other men.  William had
 to wife a woman, called Molde (Maude);  their sons were Henry and Robert,
 he was most courtly and a tall man.  William invited Harold to him and he
 was there the winter.  But in the spring they went into fellowship with
 all the goods that they had, gotten or ungotten;  and also to whichever of
 them a realm fell or was inherited, then it should belong to both of them, and
 each was to back the other in all matters, and each to avenge the other as his
 brother.  So they fared to warfare with twentyfive ships;  and they
 followed that calling six years.  Harold was the one of them that had more
 friends.</p>
 
 <p>11.  There was an earl in England hight Henry of Gloucester;  his
 son hight Helgi, a tall and strong man;  he was a wise man and
 grasping.  He gathers a host together, and harries king Edward's
 realm.  The king gathers a host against him.  That man was over the
 king's host whose name was John.  They met at Bonolfstone (sic).  And
 there was a hard battle;  and the earl got the victory, but John fell, and
 the runaways sought the king.  Then the king put that leader over the host
 whose name was Otti.  He was the son of Birgir the Welsh-champion; 
 he fared against the earl.  They met at Hrutsark;  and they fought
 for two days.  There Otti fell, and the earl laid the land under
 him.  That the king heard.  He sent men after Harold Godwin's son and
 Leif;  but meanwhile he gathers force.  The messengers came to Harold
 and tell him the king's words.  Harold says to William that he will yield
 the king help, but William says, "I will not part with my
 host."  "Then" William says, "I will not part with my
 host."  "Then" answers Harold, "we will share our
 goods and warriors between us."  William says, "Thou mayst fare
 if thou likest, but the sharing of our goods shall not be brought about
 now."  Harold says, "One thing or the other shall be, that we
 shall part the goods or we two shall come to fight for them."  It
 came about at last that the sharing of the goods was carried out.  It is
 said that too much knowledge was between those two, Harold and queen
 Molde;  butwhen William brought this against Harold he denied it. 
 And afterwards the plan of Molde and Harold was that he asked for the hand of
 the daughter of William and herself.  And that matter was settled that he
 plighted his troth to her ere he fared to England;  and their bridal was
 to be at Rouen after twelve months space.  And then they parted friends
 for that once.  Harold held on to England, and goes to find king
 Edward.  Now the king gets together a host, and fares against earl Henry,
 and they meet at that river which is called Lodda (Loddon).  And then they
 fell to the greatest battle.  The king had so drawn up his host that
 Harold was to take the earl in flank with his men.  And when the battle
 had stood for a little while, Harold came with a great force at the back of the
 earl's array and there was great slaughter.  And next to that flight broke
 out among the earl's men;  and that earl was taken prisoner, and a hundred
 men with him.  After that the earl was slain and thirty men with him, but
 the rest were enthralled.  A freeman came before the king, and said,
 "Here is a young and strongman, I would, lord, that you gave him to me,
 and I will make him my thrall."  The king answers, "He looks to
 me so that it will hardly be in thy power to use force to him;  but if he
 runs away thou wilt have to smart for it;  but if thou gettest no work out
 of him then bring him back to me."  The freeman said he had no fear
 that he could not tame him.  After that they fared away home.  The
 farmer said to that man, "We two will strike a bargain;  I will treat
 thee well, but thou shalt work hard."  The Guest says, "I will
 not work."  The farmer said, "Thou shalt be put into a house by
 thyself, and be starved to death then, if thou wilt not work." 
 "Thou must have thy way,"  said Guest.  So the farmer puts
 him into a house and starves him.  At the same time he beats Guest so that
 he can hardly walk, and sometimes he flogs him so that blood lay on the
 earth.  Between whiles he offers him money to work.  Guest would not
 hear of it.  And one time Guest said to the farmer, "Leave off
 torturing me to work, for I tell thee henceforth once for all that thou wilt
 not enthrall me so with all thy household."  The farmer says,
 "Then I will take thee to the king."  Guest answers, "The
 king will no more enthrall me than thou, though there is more hope of his doing
 so than of thee."  "His boons thou shalt soon get," says
 the farmer.  "I had meant," says Guest, "to beg little of
 thee;  but I would like to settle what time we two are to come before the
 king."  The farmer agrees to that.  Guest says, "Then it
 shall be on Yule day as the king goes to high-mass."  And so they
 do.  The farmer greets the king, and said, "Here is that man whom ye
 gave me last autumn;  but I cannot get him enthralled;  for a hard
 stone is better to soften than his heart."  The king said, "Then
 kill him."  Guest said, "Peace I must have on this
 day."  The king goes to church, and Guest says, "Fare thou home,
 master, and be well pleased that we two part as things are."  But
 when the mass was sung then Guest goes before the king, and said, "It has
 been told me that ye give to every man Yule-peace though thou hast great cause
 against him."  The king says, "Have thou peace, if any one will
 take thee into his keeping."  Guest goes into the hall with the king,
 and walks up to Heming, and bids him set him free with the king.  And so
 he does, that he gets, peace for Guest on over Yule.</p>
 
 <p>12.    But when Yule was out, Guest bade Heming give him his
 help.  Heming says, "I cannot set my heart on begging for thee if I
 do not know whom thou art."  Guest says, "If there is little
 hope of thy yielding me help when thou dost not know, there is none at all
 after thou knowest what man I am."  Heming says, I would not yield it
 thee, if thou thinkest thyself too good to tell me whom thou art." 
 Then Guest said, "Thou must have thy way;  but my name is Helgi earl
 Henry's son;  but I changed arms with my shieldbearer in the flight, but
 he fell;  and they thought they had slain me."  Heming goes
 before the king, and asks for leave for Guest to stay in the country, and taht
 the king granted him for Heming's sake.</p>
 
 <p>13.   After the death of king Edward, Harold Godwin's son took the
 kingdom in England in that wise as is said in the Saga of king Harold Sigurd's
 son.  There it is said also that Tosti and the other brothers of Harold
 Godwin's son would have the rule in England with him, and did not get it. 
 Then Tosti fared to Denmark to meet king Sweyn his kinsman, and he was well
 treated there.  Tosti asked king Sweyn whether he had any claim to the
 realm in England.  The king answers:  "I do not hide this, that
 I once thought I had;  but methinks it is now well bestowed when my kinsman
 king Harold rules over it, for we two are cousin's sons on the mother's
 side."  Tosti answers:  "Many men say there in the land and
 in his council, that I and my brothers own a third of the land."  The
 king answers:  "Methinks then that Harold is not sole king in England
 if ye have a trithing."  Tosti said, "If you would fare now to
 win the land, I and my brothers will yield you strength, and all our means, if
 thou wilt take the lead.  On these terms, if we win the land that thou
 shalt make us kings over the land;  and we shall pay thee skatt, and give
 over the land to you if you need it."  The king answers: 
 "I will think over my answer about this,"  and said he should be
 there with him that winter.  Tosti wished to know how his errand had sped
 as soon as ever he could.</p>
 
 <p>14.  It happened once in the autumn that the king rode to a feast and
 Tosti with him.  And so it was that they baited out by a bridge and
 ate.  The king had a herd-hound, which fared with them;  and the
 hound had given him one small loaf of bread.  The hound runs on the bridge
 and sees his shadow in the water; and it seemed to him as though there was
 another hound in it, and that he had another loaf in his mouth.  So he
 leapt off from the bridge into the river, and dived down into the water, and
 thought he would get the loaf from the other hound.  Now when he comes
 into the water then he loses all, and so fares back empty to land.  Now
 the king said to Tosti, "Sawest thou how my hound fared just
 now?"  Tosti said "I did not pay close heed to it." 
 The king said "The hound thought he saw another hound in the water which
 had a loaf in its mouth, and thought he must get and take away the loaf. 
 But he leapt after his shadow, and brought neither loaf to land.  So I
 know it will fare with me if I fare now to England;  then I shall see my
 shadow.  But though I get back hither, then it may be that king Harold (of
 Norway) will be here before me, and then I shall not get this realm
 either.  So now I give thee my decision on thy business, that I do not
 come to England because I will be king in Denmark so long as God wills; 
 for it behoves me now never to covet anything more.  But thou Tosti must
 fare to king Harold."  And so he did.</p>
 
 <p>15.  That autumn before Tosti came to Norway, Thorir of Steig dreamed a
 dream, and told it to his men and bade them interpret it.  He said he
 thought he was standing at a Thing which king Harold was at.  He sat on so
 great a chair that it filled all Norway;  but the king was so big that his
 body reached out on all sides away from the chair.  "Methought a man
 went up to him and kissed him;  but so methought a big fly flew out of
 that man's mouth into the king's mouth just like a raven.  At that
 methought the king got a raven's neb and with it he smote on the head all those
 who were at the Thing save us men of Steig;  of that methought many died,
 but all took harm of it.  I was then afraid that he would smite us men of
 Steig.  At that I woke.  Now will I myself interpret it.  When
 we were standing at the Thing and the king sat in the chair;  that was his
 throne of might.  But when he stretched every way beyond the chair then
 his greed grew in every way out of his realm.  But when methought he had a
 raven's neb;  then I am afraid that he will be a prey to raven's nebs, and
 that the ravens will suck his blood.  When methought he smote men on the
 head with his neb;  that I guess will fall on their pates, so that many
 will get their death from it, but it will go hard with all those who are with
 him."  But we men of Steig will not follow him." 
 ............ become wise of witnesses that another is king over England. 
 Now when it comes to Yule .............. Tosti might now take such fiefs of
 Harold, as of Sweyn, if the land were won.  Tosti also tells him that king
 Sweyn would not turn towards his business.  The king says that he will
 take counsel with his men how this shall be answered.  Now Tosti was with
 the king over the winter.  That winter earlier king Harold had sent
 Thorarin Nefjulf's son and Hjort east to Holmgard after that goat-skin which he
 left behind him there with queen Ellisif, as was said before, and they were not
 to come back unless they got the skin and the goods which were in it. 
 They came back when Tosti had been a little while with the king.  Hjort
 went in before the king and greeted him and says that Ellisif sent her greeting
 to the king.  But he was so eager in his talk with Tosti that he took no
 heed of those who had come.  Then Hjort sang a stave:</p>
 
 <p>"The prince his gold</p>
 
 <p>Piles fast together;</p>
 
 <p>But never a word</p>
 
 <p>Will the sow's son (2) utter:</p>
 
 <p>Gey little land</p>
 
 <p>Should lap-Hamdir (3) have,</p>
 
 <p>Then perhaps Harold</p>
 
 <p>Would answer a man."</p>
 
 <p>            "How
 little?" says the king.  "No more" says Hjort "than
 thou mightiest lie upon."  The king smiles and asks "How has it
 fared Icelander?"  Hjort sang:</p>
 
 <p>"Outside (4) in the 'toun'</p>
 
 <p>Is a billy-goat white,</p>
 
 <p>He glares with his eyes,</p>
 
 <p>And has a long beard;</p>
 
 <p>He stamps with his hoofs</p>
 
 <p>And will carry off bairns,</p>
 
 <p>This nanny-goat's son</p>
 
 <p>Is madly ye-made."</p>
 
 <p>            The king
 bade them bear in the money.  Then the goat-skin is borne in before the
 king.  Then he asks whether she gave it without a word who handed the
 money over.  Thorarin said she said never a word.  The king said
 "He shall be asked who is more right-worded.  "What sayest thou
 about it Hjort?"  He answers, "This I say, that she sang a
 stave."  The king said "What was that?"  Hjort sang:</p>
 
 <p>"Never next spring,</p>
 
 <p>With longships west,</p>
 
 <p>Shall hare-hearted Harold,</p>
 
 <p>O'er salt-sea sail:</p>
 
 <p>For long shall be</p>
 
 <p>That quaking king</p>
 
 <p>Quite without hope</p>
 
 <p>Of England and fame."</p>
 
 <p>            Then said
 Tosti, "This is a spaedom when they bid you fare to England;  is
 there no hope of your coming thither?"  The king said, "Thou
 shalt go to the shrine of the Saint king Olaf, and thou shalt swear an oath
 that thou shalt speak the truth of the power *  *  *  *  *
 but I will raise an host out of the land to win England, but I alone will have
 the whole rule over the host."  Tosti said he would take the oaths,
 "But if anything thwarts your expedition, then these oaths shall fall back
 on you."  The king said so it should be.  After that the king
 sends letters over all Norway, and ordered out the whole strength of the
 people.  Then came to him Eystein the gorcock, the son of Thorberg Arni's
 son, and betrothed to Maria the daughter of king Harold and Ellisif the
 daughter of king Jaroslaf of Holmgard.  Her mother was Ingigerd daughter
 of king Olaf the Swede.  Nicholas Thorberg's son had then the stewardship
 in the nearest Thing (district) in Helgeland.  This host gathered together
 in the Solunds.  There was come the king and earl Tosti, and fifty
 liegemen.  And one morning as the king lay waiting for a fair wind he
 tells Tosti his dream;  that he thought a man boarded his ship, and he
 thought he knew it was his brother king Olaf.  "He was very
 wrathful" he said and sang a stave:</p>
 
 <p>"I, the king so stout in story,</p>
 
 <p>Famous for all time to come,</p>
 
 <p>Battles won and gathered glory,</p>
 
 <p>Fell a saint --- but died at home:</p>
 
 <p>But this fleet to ruin wending,</p>
 
 <p>Rends my soul with woe-unending,</p>
 
 <p>Doomed to death and heaven-hated,</p>
 
 <p>Ogre-steeds (5) will soon be sated."</p>
 
 <p>            Tosti
 answers, "King Olaf cannot have sung this stave;  I rather think it
 is the witchcraft of Englishmen."  "I ween," says the king
 "that no one is so skilled in witchcraft that he can take the likeness of
 king Olaf on him."  "A good man was king Olaf," says Tosti,
 "But yet wizards have shown themselves in the bodies of those men who were
 not less holy than he."  The king answers, "I will fare to
 England with thee for the sake of seeking atonement, but for naught else." 
 Tosti answers, "On thee shall fall the oaths if thou breakest up the
 levies."  The king says, "I will not run the risk of that."</p>
 
 <p>16.  It is so said when the king sailed out through Dontheim firth, and
 he *  *  *  *  *  * a man (came) in a boat to his ship
 and bade the king run into the land and help his sick wife.  The king
 asked what sickness she had.  The freeman said that she had fallen asleep
 by a well;  it was thought that some snake had got into her mouth, and it
 will ever since drink water."  The king says the ship shall run into
 land.  "Then ye shall know that ye have a haughty king, though he be
 called hard and stingy."  The king goes on land and Thiodolf skald
 with him.  They come to the woman, and the king bade them bear the woman
 to the same well whence she got her sickness.  He bade them turn her on
 her face and lay her lips down close to the well.  The king sat by and had
 a pair of pincers in his hand.  He made them kindle by him a little
 fire.  The woman wept sore;  and begged they would give her to
 drink;  but for all that the king would not let her have the water. 
 Then her pain presses up into her throat;  and her mouth bursts open and
 out comes a snake's head.  The king took the pincers and caught the
 snake's head and drew out of her a living snake, and cast it into the
 fire.  The woman is carried home after that and she was soon made
 whole.  After that the king goes to his ship and sails south along the
 land with all that host that had then come to him from the north of the land.</p>
 
 <p>17.  It is so said that as the king lay in the Solunds there sailed in
 then off the main a Greenland ship.  The captain of that ship was a man
 called Corpse-Lodin, for that he had brought the body of Finn fain and his crew
 from the Finnbooths, east of the Jokuls in Greenland at the bidding of Saint
 Olaf the king;  for Finn was the son of Kettle Calf of Ringness in
 Heidmark, and Gunnhilda the sister of king Olaf.  They put off a boat and
 row to the king's ship, and Lodin greets the king.  The king asked how
 long they had been at sea?  "Seven nights."  The king
 asked, "Were ye ware of any new thing on the voyage?"  "I
 can think of nothing new now" Lodin answers.  "Then his
 companions launched the boat."  Then the king said, "Thy men do
 not think thou tellest the truth;  so tell it now."  Lodin
 answers, "When we had sailed two nights away from the land, then we saw a
 fire burning;  it was so long that we could not see the end on either
 side;  it was as blue as flame;  we had the fairest wind, but we
 could in no wise sail by it.  My plan was to sail right for the fire where
 it was lowest.  We felt the heat of the fire, and the sheets on both sides
 were burnt and *  *  *  *  *  * the sheets and bodies
 with fresh Greenland (tar).  And when we had sailed three half days a pack
 of clouds came over our ship;  there followed such great darkness that men
 could not see their hands.  Then we heard a great crash;  I looked
 up;  then the pack of clouds was broken asunder, and blood fell out of it
 all around us  *  *  *  *  *  * as it were a
 great waterfall, and this stream of blood came down on our ship and I made them
 set (buckets) under it, and that blood may still be seen here, and it is now
 clotted after it cooled;  for it was warm when it came down.  And
 when we had sailed still three half days, then we heard a great roar.  We
 saw then many birds flying, the names of which I knew in Norway;  those
 flew nearest us who were the greatest.  They crew and clucked with mickle
 glee.  This flight lasted about three hours, so that we could not see
 clear sky for it, and yet the same birds never flew by us again.  After
 that we sailed two days still ere we came to land yester even.  Then we
 saw the same birds flying from the west across the sea;  and then all the
 biggest birds were away.  Then they all flew in silence, and as it were
 sorrowful.  And when they came to land they scattered and each lit by
 itself.  And now I have naught more to tell you."  The king
 said, "Thou wishedst to keep this from me when thou saidest thou hadst
 seen nothing."  Lodin answers, "I said so, Lord, because I
 thought this now no wonder after you had resolved on your expedition from the
 land."  "Why?" said the king.  Lodin said,
 "Because you will not come back;  but it is to be looked for that
 there will be great wonders before the falling away of such chiefs." 
 The king said, "Wilt thou follow me?"  "You must settle
 that" answers Lodin, "but I will seek the bodies of those of your men
 who lose their lives."  The king answers, "I stand more in need
 of men when I am alive;  but this is why you must fare with me, because
 thou sayst thou knowest all about our doings."  Then the king said,
 "Thinkest thou Tosti this any wonder?"  "Had it
 happened" says Tosti "to a truthful man it would have been something
 new."  "It would be worth much" says Lodin, "that thou
 Tosti lyest no more lies between land and land than I."  The king
 gave Lodin leave to depart.</p>
 
 <p>18.    Hugi was the name of a priest who sang mass at
 Avallsnes in Körmt.  He dreamed one night that he thought he looked into
 the churchyard, and it seemed that all the folk who were buried there were up
 and stirring.  They had a man among them, and tossed him about the one to
 the other;  but on the other side of the church they had another man, and
 him they tugged each to the other.  Thence there came forward a woman to
 the priest.  She was stark-naked.  The priest asked what the pother
 meant.  She answers, "A corpse will come to church tomorrow when the
 sun is in the southeast which neither side will touch;  but one will come
 at midday which all will drag towards them;  but that corpse that comes
 first I wish to be buried on the east of the churchyard;  but that which
 comes later I wish buried on the north, where the nave and choir meet; 
 and there ye shall find bones of a man, and those I wish to be piled all round
 outside the corpse, for they are my bones."  "Then tell
 me," says the priest, "how will our king fare when he leaves the
 land?"  She answers, "He will fall."  The priest
 asked, "Who will then rule the realm?"  "Peaceful,"
 she says.  "How long will he reign?"  says the priest
 "Seven winters and twenty" she says.  "What will come after
 him?"  he says.  "Strifeful will come then." 
 "How long will he reign?"  says the priest.  "Ten
 winters," she says.  "What comes after that?"  he
 says.  "Good-rede and Goodwill and Hardrede," she says. 
 "Which of them will be longest lived?"  "Hardrede,"
 she says.  "How long will he reign?" says the priest.  "Five
 and twenty winters," she says, "but after him there will be many ill
 deeds.  But now I must tell thee nothing more."  The priest
 awakes, and next day the corpses came just as she said.  But it was Olaf
 the quiet whom she called "Peaceful," but Magnus barelegs whom she
 called "Strifeful";  Eystein whom she named Goodrede, but Olaf
 whom she called Goodwill, but Jewry-Sigurd who was Hardrede.  But God
 forbade that she should tell those ill deeds which were done afterwards.</p>
 
 <p>19.    Now we must turn to that that king Harold sails out to
 sea with his host;  he came first to the Orkneys, and left there behind
 him his daughter Maria and much other folk.  Thence the king sails to
 England;  and they came to Scarborough.  Then the weather fell calm,
 and they lay there the night over.  Men awoke at something that was sung
 in the air;  and each thought as though it were over his own ship. 
 All look up aloft to see a witch riding on a wolf in the air.  She had a
 trough on her knees filled with blood and limbs of men.  She sang these
 three staves:</p>
 
 <p>"Westward Ho" with noise and rattle</p>
 
 <p>Rushes on the king to battle;</p>
 
 <p>Helter skelter, hurry-scurry,</p>
 
 <p>T'is for me they waste and worry!</p>
 
 <p>Soon my raven's darling brood</p>
 
 <p>Will fatten on their dainty food,</p>
 
 <p>Titbits torn from sailors stricken,</p>
 
 <p>Where I am disasters thicken:</p>
 
 <p>Where I am disasters thicken.</p>
 
 <p>Mighty fells shall veil their head,</p>
 
 <p>Sickness o'er mankind be spread,</p>
 
 <p>Peace be broke and hatred rise</p>
 
 <p>'Twixt land and land beneath the skies:</p>
 
 <p>On you, as on the folk of yore,</p>
 
 <p>I will lay my burden sore,</p>
 
 <p>South my wolf wends men to swallow,</p>
 
 <p>My weird is spoke, your doom will follow:</p>
 
 <p>My weird is spoke, your doom will follow.</p>
 
 <p>The Ogre-bride that scatters ruin,</p>
 
 <p>Kens the king's misfortunes brewing:</p>
 
 <p>What avails his fame in field,</p>
 
 <p>If she shows her blood-red shield!</p>
 
 <p>Lo!  she plies the monster's maw</p>
 
 <p>Piling flesh 'twixt either jaw,</p>
 
 <p>Till from out her loathsome store,</p>
 
 <p>All his fangs are red with gore:</p>
 
 <p>All his fangs are red with gore."</p>
 
 <p>            The king
 asked Tosti whether he is awake;  Tosti answers, "I have waked just
 now at this strain."  The king said, "Thinkest thou this is of
 any worth?"  "Naught," says Tosti.  "Then art
 thou dead at heart," "never saw I such tokens before." 
 They take the shore and land at the district called Cleveland.  The king
 asks Tosti "What is the name of yon height north there in the
 land?"  "Every hillock," says Tosti, "has not a name
 given it."  "This, though," says the king, "must have
 a name, and thou shalt tell it me."  "That," says Tosti,
 "is the 'how' of Ivar the boneless."  "Few are they,"
 answers the king, "who have conquered England who have come first to his
 'how'."  "Tis to believe in old wives' tales," says Tosti,
 "to put faith in such things now."</p>
 
 <p>20. They go on land with the host, but some watch the ships.  Those
 brothers Morcar and earl Voltheof, and Aki their brother in law, gather a host
 together as soon as they hear of the Norwegian host.  They met at that
 river which is hight Ouse, and there the hardest fight arises, and is kept up
 till nones.  Then Eystein had gone through the array of the English and
 slain Aki the tall.  Then he sees that Morcar has got at the back of
 Tosti's battle;  and so he turns with his men at the back of Morcar's
 battle.  And when earl Morcar sees that he bids his men face about and
 defend themselves well and manfully.  And at last flight broke out among
 his men, and they flee out into the river and earl Morcar is there slain and
 the most part of his folk.  Many too sunk beneath the stream.  By
 that time king Harold had taken earl Valtheof prisoner.  Then Tosti goes
 to the king and said, "Let those brothers both fare one
 journey."  "Thou shalt slay," says the king, "those
 whom thou takest, but I will have my way as to him."  (Then) the king
 said to Valtheof, "I will give thee peace if thou wilt swear never to
 fight against me, and to send me word if thou knowest that treachery is plotted
 against me the same day."  "I will not swear that" says
 Valtheof; "and I will not to save my life cease to stand by my brother
 Harold, so long as I may;  but I will send thee word if I know that
 treachery is plotted against thee, and I will do that to save my life; 
 but I will swear no oath;  for it looks to me as though Tosti does not
 mean me to have much inheritance."  The king left Valtheof quite free
 to fare whithersoever he would.  Tosti says, "A senseless deed! 
 to let that man loose whom ye think too good to take an oath." 
 "I ween" said the king, "that his word is better than thy
 handsel."  Tosti said, "Let us fare with our host to London, and
 let us waste the land with fire and sword, and give no peace to any man, neither
 women nor bairns."  And so it was done.  And after that they
 fare to their ships and south along the coast, and run their ships into
 Ravensaire.  There they find in their way neither man nor cattle in the
 thorpes, everything so flies before them.  And one day when the king lay
 in a haven, then a woman rode down from the country and asked for the king of
 Norway.  The king said he was there.  She said, "I have a
 land-tent which I will give you."  "Take the tent," says
 Tosti, "and let it be burnt afterwards."  "Burn," said
 the king, "what is given to thee, but I am not aware that thy countrymen
 offer thee any honour."  He bids them set up the tent;  and all
 said with one mouth that no man had ever seen so fair a tent.  The king
 asks what return she will have for the tent.  "Sons twain I
 have," she answers, "and I would beg for life for them
 both."  The king said, that both her men and her cattle should have
 peace if he knew where they were.  After that she rode away.  But the
 king sleeps in the tent that night.  But next morning the king says to
 Thiodolf the skald that he thinks Tosti said sooth that the tent was
 uncanny.  "For methought up to this time I saw seven plans for
 whatever might happen, but now I seem to know no plan at all." 
 "But on your plans," answers Thiodolf, "we must after all
 rest."  The king said, "We will now change our plans;  we
 will go on shore with twenty hundred men, but sixty hundred shall be by the
 ships;  and their leaders shall be those brothers Eystein and
 Nicholas.  Tosti shall follow me."  So the king carries that
 out;  he lands and burns.  And when he comes to that town hight York,
 then the townsmen send him word that they will give themselves up to his power,
 and they bind that with oaths.  That the king accepts.  Afterwards he
 fares to his ships;  but the next morning he was to go on land to hold the
 town with his men, and the king lay at his ships that night.</p>
 
 <p>21.   But as soon as day came the king busked him to go on land to
 the town.  They had shields and helms, but no byrnies, except a hundred
 men that were most lissom.  "This is the greatest foolishness,"
 said Tosti, "to go nearly weaponless into the hands of one's foes; 
 for ye need not trust the English men if they get power over you, and a bad
 change has come over thee king since the gift of that woman's land
 tent."  "At what art thou afraid now, Tosti," said the
 king.  "This," he says, "methinks is much more fearful that
 thou hast been reft of thy wits than that songs have been sung over and against
 us."  "For all that I will have my way," says the
 king.  Tosti was so unbeloved by the Norwegians that no one would listen
 to him.  That same even when king Harold fared to his ships with the
 Norwegian host, Harold Godwin's son came with an overwhelming host from the
 south of England to York, and learnt there true tidings of the
 Norwegians.  But as soon as the townsmen knew that the king was come, then
 they broke altogether their word to the Norwegians, and went along with the
 host of king Harold.  And straightway in the morning he rowed (sic) his
 host down to Stoneford-bridge, which now is called Stamford, and now each fare
 against the other.  King Harold Sigurd's son said, "What is that to
 be seen up in the country (is it) a whirlwind or the dust of horsemen?" 
 "Of a surety it is the dust of horsemen," says Tosti, "and you
 will now see the faith of my countrymen."  The king halts the host
 and waits;  and soon sees that an overwhelming host in arms is faring
 against him.  Just then came a man riding, and asked for king Harold. 
 He was told where he was.  "There now is Valtheof my
 brother,"  said Tosti, "slay him."  The king forbids
 that.  Valtheof rides up before the king, and greets him, and bids him
 turn back as quick as he can to his ships, "for king Harold my brother
 fares against thee with an overwhelming host;  and you have not force to
 withstand him were ye armed, and all the less now."  The king said,
 "Farewell, Valtheof, and back thy brother well.  Thou has kept thy
 word well."  The king asked then what plan they should take; 
 and they were the most that bade the king fare to the ships to meet his
 folk.  The king answers, "Never yet fled I without a flight, and I
 will not now;  for I grudge this victory to the Englishmen that I be both
 chased and slain."  Then he sends men to the ships to tell Eystein
 the gorcock that he needed men.  But he let the trumpets sound, and sets
 his battle in array.  Then the English host also halts, and draws up its
 array.  And then there was little more than two arrow-flights between
 them.  And at that time three men ride up to the array of the Norwegians
 and asked if earl Tosti could hear their voice.  One of them, he that
 spoke, was not a big man but slender-grown, and the most courteous of all
 men.  He had a gilded helm and a red shield, and a hawk drawn on it in
 gold.  The second man was the biggest and tallest of all men, and the
 strongest and the most comely.  The third was a tall man and slim-waisted,
 and broad shouldered.  He rode last.  Tosti bade him say what he would. 
 The knight said, "Harold thy brother sent thee God's greeting and offered
 thee an atonement."  "What more," says Tosti, "does he
 offer now than before."  "He thinks," says the knight,
 "it less worth to offer now when such things have been done." 
 "We will not make that good with money," says Tosti;  "but
 what is now offered?"  "He offered," said the knight, that
 thou shouldst have a fifth of England, but he would have no atonement for his
 brother;  but what you have done in scathe to the land, that," he
 said, "must be made good."  "That I will not take,"
 says Tosti.  (Then) the knight spoke "I will not hide this which he
 said should be offered last, that he would rather offer thee half England, than
 that ye two should strive for it in battle, and along with it the title of
 king."  "Then what will he offer to Harold king of
 Norway?"  "Because," says the knight, "he was not
 content with his realm;  then I will give him three ells and a half of
 England in length, and so much more as he is of more than middle height; 
 but no more will he get here, for I care little for him."  "Too
 late," said Tosti, "have these offers been put forward;  but
 this I have often heard the Norwegians say that if a good offer were made I
 would straightway sunder myself from their quarrel;  but now that shall
 not be."  "Then," said the knight, "the king bade thee
 take the whole blame on thine own head."  And after that he turns
 away.  King Harold Sigurd's son rode on a black horse with a white blaze
 on his brow, and was telling how they should stand in array while they were
 talking.  Just then the horse fell under the king, and so it fares thrice
 running.  The king said, "Why shall it be so now brother
 Olaf?"  he says, Tosti laughs and said "Thinkest thou that king
 Olaf makes the horse fall under thee."  He says, "I shall have
 to thank no other man more for it than thee if he turns away from
 me."  He gets off the horse and goes into the array.  The king
 said to Tosti, "Who was this knight who spoke with thee."  "King
 Harold my brother," says Tosti.  "Why saidst thou that so
 late," says the king.  "I would not," says Tosti,
 "betray him when he rode trusting in my good faith."  "He
 is a stately man," said the king, and a goodly, and he stands now well in
 his stirrups, but yet he will not rule the lands long.  But who was on
 either side of him?"  "Helgi Henry's son was one," 
 says Tosti, "but the other is called Bjarleif."  "I little
 thought," says the king, "to see that man here;  for I know the
 man;  and I would not have fared hither on this warfare, if I had known he
 was alive."  "That is no business of ours," says
 Tosti.  Then king Harold Godwin's son, asked Leif, "Who was that tall
 man under whom the horse fell."  "That was the Norwegian
 king,"  answers Leif.  "He is a grim looking man,"
 says the king, "but not likely to live long;  for I guess his days
 are now spent."  The king of Norway had so drawn up his array that
 his men who had shields were to stand in a ring, and all look outwards. 
 But those who have no shields shall stand inside and fight out beyond
 them.  But when the two battles were joined, then the Englishmen threw a
 ring round the Norwegian array.  Heming had told his name and all that had
 befallen him ere he went into the battle.  Then the Englishmen shout their
 war cry.  Then King Harold Sigurd's son, sang a
 stave:                                                
                                                                        
        "Onward we go</p>
 
 <p>In battle array,</p>
 
 <p>Byrnieless meeting</p>
 
 <p>Blue steel today:</p>
 
 <p>Bright helms are blinking,</p>
 
 <p>But Emma (6) I lack;</p>
 
 <p>Our war-weeds lie wasted,</p>
 
 <p>Down by the sea-wrack."</p>
 
 <p>            "Now
 that is ill sung," says the king, "and it shall be mended."</p>
 
 <p>"Come each warrior to the field,</p>
 
 <p>Never creep behind your shield!</p>
 
 <p>Where the onslaught rageth highest</p>
 
 <p>Odin's arm is ever nighest.</p>
 
 <p>She the maid that winneth battles (7)</p>
 
 <p>Bade me bear my head on high,</p>
 
 <p>When on brain-pan sword-blade rattles</p>
 
 <p>There to win the day or die."</p>
 
 <p>            King
 Harold Sigurd's son, bade his men not fight too hotly, but to stand fast and
 not to quail.  The Englishmen then begin the onslaught, but the Norwegians
 defend themselves so well that naught came of it.  Then king Harold
 Godwin's son, said to Helgi, Henry's son, "What plan shall be now taken to
 break their stand;  for it is to be looked for soon that help will come to
 them from the ships, and then we shall not attack them so well when we can do
 nothing with them now, and they are but a handful of men."  "We
 shall" says Helgi "fall on them as stoutly as we can;  and if we
 take no hold of them, then we will turn away from the, and may be they will
 think that we are flying, and then they will break their array and follow us
 up, and after that we will turn on them again as quickly as we can." 
 And so they did.  And when the Norwegians saw that they turned away then
 they pursued them, but when the others turned on them, then they could not get
 into their array and make a stand a second time.  And now the battle was
 deadly;  but where they, king Harold and Tosti, stood their was no yielding. 
 Then king Harold Godwin's son said to Heming, "What is the good now of thy
 cunning and thy sharp-shooting when thou dost not shoot the king;  thou
 alone canst pick him out."  "I do not hide it" says Heming
 "that I have marked down the king, but I dare not shoot him because of
 king Olaf."  "I know not" says king Harold "for what
 thou faredst to the battle, if thou wilt take no part in it.  Shoot now so
 that I may know him, because I dare shoot him in spite of king Olaf." 
 Then Heming shot at the king with a loose arrow, (8) and hit him on the cheek,
 and the arrow hung in the flesh.  The king cut the arrow out at once, but
 he was easily known by that.  Then Harold Godwin's son, shoots at king
 Harold and hits him in the throat.  Then the king sat him down.  He
 said to Thiodolf the skald, "Come thou hither and sit under my head. 
 I have long held up thy head."  Tosti went to the king and asked
 whether he was wounded.  The king answers, "A little bit of iron was
 sent me;  but this I ween that it was not for nothing that it was borne
 out of the forge.  I will that thou takest an atonement from thy brother,
 but as for me I will take that portion of the realm which was offered me this
 morning."  Tosti says,  "One carle shall be the host of us
 twain tonight."  There thou speakest," says the king, "of
 that carle of whom I would ask never to take lodging."  And after
 that the king died.  Then the Englishmen shouted their warcry;  and
 say that the king of the Norwegians is fallen, and offer Tosti an
 atonement.  Then Tosti grasps the banner;  and says that they shall
 find that all the Norwegian leaders are not fallen, "So long as I am able
 to fight."  And now Tosti keeps up the battle for a while.  Then
 said Heming, "Why, lord, dost thou not now egg me on to shoot." 
 "Because," says the king, "I will not do my brother to
 death."  "It is wondrous" says Heming, "that you
 should like to let your men be killed down; and I will send him one keepsake if
 ye do not forbid it."  "I will not" says the king,
 "let any vengeance be now taken though any hurt be wrought on
 him."  Then Heming shoots into Tosti's eye.  Then Tosti said,
 when he got the shot, "This marked me for God," and died at
 once.  King Harold then offered the Norwegians peace.  Just then came
 Eystein gorcock and asked Thiodolf skald what tidings had happened there. 
 Thiodolf chanted ----</p>
 
 <p>"The host has had a heavy blow,</p>
 
 <p>Entrapped I call this army now;</p>
 
 <p>For no good end did Harold call</p>
 
 <p>His lieges from the East to fall:</p>
 
 <p>The clever captain's life is sped,</p>
 
 <p>And we are left in evil stead."</p>
 
 <p>            Eystein
 said, "Let us go forward manfully;  we will not fight under our
 shields, as though we thought we were going to get anything else here than our
 graves."  They rush so hard on that all the English array goes
 back.  They tell the king that now they have not to do with mere
 men.  The king answers, "Men they are, and lives they
 have."  But when they had fought long, then Nicholas said, "We
 may not keep up this onslaught any longer, for the sake of weariness." 
 "Sooth is that," answers Eystein, "and so we must seek out a
 plan.  We will spring to the wood, but the Englishmen will not follow us
 up much, for they will be glad of any rest that befalls them;  then we
 will throw off our armour and afterwards renew the attack:  and each man
 of us shall fight for fame and not for length of days."  That, they
 said, they were all willing to do.  And so they took that plan.  Now
 the Englishmen shout and offer peace to the Norwegians.  Then Eystein and
 the Norwegians rush forward and say that they shall find that the Norwegians
 would have no peace.  Then the battle begins anew;  then the
 Englishmen run away by hundreds from the king.  Nicholas, Thorberg's son,
 fights with Helgi, Heming's son, and Nicholas presses on so fast that Helgi can
 do naught else than fall back and defend himself;  but Eystein gorcock
 attacks the king and Valtheof.  So hard was that fight, that ever since in
 England "Gorcock's Bout" is used to mean great peril of men. 
 Then great loss of life happens, and more on the Norwegian side, for they were
 bare of weapons.  Then Heming sees that Helgi is overcome by
 Nicholas.  Then Heming shoots Nicholas in the small ribs, so that the
 arrow came out on the other side.  Then Nicholas and Thiodolf skald, and a
 great crowd of the Norwegians fell.  Eystein kept up the battle, and went
 so near the king that he slew his standard bearer.  That Heming sees, and
 shoots an arrow under Eystein's arm, and into his heart, and he fell with great
 glory.  All the Norwegians fled as soon as Eystein was fallen, those who
 could compass it.  But the Englishmen did not chase the fleers.  Then
 king Harold rode to London with no more company than five hundred men.  He
 got men to bear to church the bodies of those men who had fallen, as well Norwegians
 as his own men.  He also gave leave to Olaf, Harold's son, to go away from
 Ravensaire, and all those Norwegians who were left alive.</p>
 
 <p>22. William the bastard ruled over France as was before said.  He hears
 of the warfare of king Harold to England;  and he sends word over his
 realm, and summons to him a great host.  Then he speaks to them and says,
 "It is known to you how the partnership of us two, mine and Harold
 Godwin's son's fared;  now it is told me that a host is attacking his
 realm.  Now I will fare with this host to avenge him if anything has
 befallen him.  But besides at no other time will it be easier to avenge on
 Harold that shame which he has put on me, and to claim England;  even
 though he may have gained the day, for all his bravest and briskest folk will
 be either wounded or war-weary."  But on that day with William rode
 out of Rouen;  then his wife went up to him when he had got on horseback,
 and took hold on his stirrup, and wished to speak to him;  but he smote
 the horse with his spurs and she fell down before the horse, and the horse trod
 her down and she got her death there and then.  He said, "When bale
 is highest bote is nighest, (9) and it is now more likely that our journey will
 be good."  After that they get on board ship and sail to England, and
 he harries as soon as he comes into the land.  It is so said that he made
 them burn Ivar the boneless ere he began to harry.  That king Harold
 hears, and summons men to him;  then his folk were very sore of their
 wounds.  The king offers them to leave the land if they thought they were
 unable to follow him;  but all said that they would follow him.  The
 king says, "Give me up if ye will not follow me truly."  They
 said they would never part from him.  He marches with his host against
 William.  And there a hard battle arose.  That was nineteen nights
 later than that on which king Harold Sigurd's son fell.  Then there was a
 great slaughter of the Englishmen because there were many in that battle who
 were fit for nothing.  They fought all day.  And about even king
 Harold Godwin's son fell, but Heming and Helgi and Valtheof threw their men
 into swine-snout array (10) and nothing could touch them.  Then said
 William, "I will give thee peace, Valtheof, if thou wilt swear fealty to
 me;  then shalt thou have the inheritance of thy fathers' and the
 earldom."  "I will swear thee no oaths," answers Valtheof,
 "but I will give my word to be true to thee if thou grantest
 that."  "On these terms we two will be atoned," says William. 
 "What lot," asked Valtheof, "shall they have, Heming and Helgi,
 if they come into the atonement?"  "Helgi," answers
 William, "shall have his inheritance and his earldom;  he shall swear
 fealty to me, and tell me all those plans which he can see better than I can; 
 but Heming shall be with me;  and if he be true to me then I will honour
 him most of all men."  Then Valtheof asks, "What plan will ye
 two take?"  "Heming shall settle,"  says Helgi. 
 "I know," answers Heming, "that it will seem worth while to you
 Englishmen to stay this war;  but methinks there is no joy in living after
 this battle;  but still I will no longer keep you in peril than ye
 wish;  but this I ween that Valtheof's peace will be short." 
 "Better is it," answers Valtheof, "that we should be overthrown
 than to trust no one;  nor shall any more men lose their lives for my
 sake."  They gave up the battle, and go into the king's peace. 
 Then William is chosen to be king, and they ride thence to London. 
 Valtheof begged leave to go home, and got it, and rode away with ten men. 
 The king looked after them, and said, "It is unwise to let that man ride
 away free who will swear us no oaths;  and ride after him, and slay
 him."  And so they did.  Valtheof got off his horse, and forbade
 his men to defend themselves.  He went to a church, and was there
 slain;  and there he is buried, and men think he is a good man.</p>
 
 <p>23.   That night after king Harold Godwin's son, had fallen, then
 there drove to the field of carnage a cotter and his wife to strip the slain
 and get themselves fee;  they saw there great heaps of dead, and they see
 there a bright light.  They spake together and say that there must be some
 holy man among the slain, and they fall to clearing away the dead where they
 saw the light;  they see that a man's arm came up out of the slain, and on
 it was a great gold ring.  The goodman took the arm in his hand, and asked
 whether that man lived.  He answers, "I live."  The carline
 said, "Clear away the corpses, I think this is the king."  They
 raise up the man and asked if he were to be healed.  The king says,
 "I do not gainsay that I might be healed, but that ye two will not be able
 to do."  "We will run the risk of that," said the
 carline.  They lifted him up and laid him on the wain and drive home with
 him.  The carline said, "Thou shalt cut the thews out of the draught
 beast, and the ears off his head;  and if men come to thy house to look
 for the king's body, then thou shalt say that I am out of my wits, but that
 wolves have torn thy horse."  They cleanse and bind up the king's
 wounds and hide him in their cottage.  A little after king William's men
 come thither, and ask whether he had borne to his house king Harold alive or
 dead.  The carle answers, "That I have not done."  "It
 is not to be gainsaid," they answer, "for the trail of blood lies
 toward thy house."  "As to your king," says the carle,
 "methinks he is no loss;  more loss methinks is there in my draught
 horse which the wolves tore the night before the battle happened." 
 "This must be sooth," they answered, "for we saw here the horse
 torn, but still we will go in here and search and see what is to be found
 here."  "There is no end to my woes," said the carle,
 "my wife has lost her wits, in that she heard the horns and the shouts of
 battle."  Still, for all that, they will go indoors;  but when
 they came inside there the carline sat by the hearth and ate charcoal; 
 and when she sees the men she jumps up and snatches a pitchfork and swore at
 them, and says she will slay them.  They go out and laugh at her and go
 home as things stood, and told the king they could not find king Harold's
 body.  But the carline and her husband had the king in hiding till he was
 quite whole;  then the king sends the carline to Heming, and she tells him
 where the king was.  "Now foster-mother" says Heming "it
 stood you in good stead that thou hadst something in thy head." 
 "I was not mad at any rate," answers the carline.  The day after
 Heming came to the king and there was a very joyful meeting;  they talk
 together all that day.  Heming offers the king to go through the whole
 land, and gather a host together.  "And then" (he says)
 "you will soon get the land away from William."  "I
 see," said the king, "that this may come about, but there would be
 far too many oaths broken, and I am not willing that such wickedness should
 spring from me.  Now I will go after the pattern of king Olaf, Tryggvi's
 son, who after he lost the day off Wendland would not come back to his realm,
 but rather fared out to Greece, and there served God while he lived.  Now
 I will let a hermit's cell be made for me at Canterbury, where I may very often
 see king William in the church;  but that food alone will I have which
 thou bringest to me."  To this Heming agreed.  The king gives
 the carle and his wife good store of money, but goes afterwards into a
 hermitage.  There he is three winters, so that no one knew what manner of
 man he is beside Heming and the priest who shrove him.  And one day that
 Heming came to Harold then he tells him he has taken that sickness which will
 bring him to his death.  And on a day when king William sat at the board
 then a ringing of bells was heard over the whole town.  The king asks why
 there was such a pretty peal.  "I guess," says Heming,
 "that a monk is dead whose name was Harold."  "What Harold
 is that?"  says the king.  "Godwin's son," says
 Heming.  "Who has harboured him?"  says the king. 
 "I have done that," answers Heming.  "If that be
 sooth," says the king, "then it shall be thy death;  but we will
 see his body."  After that they go into the cell where the body
 lay;  and then it was stripped, and then all knew king Harold.  The
 body was fair and comely, and men smelt there a sweet savour, so that all who
 were by understood that he was a truly saintly man.  Then the king asked
 Heming what he would do to save his life.  "What do you
 ask?"  ask Heming.  "That," says the king, "thou
 swearest me this oath that thou shalt be to me as true in all things as (thou
 wast) to king Harold, and back me as thou backedst him." 
 "Rather will I die with him," says Heming, "than live with thee;
 but I might have betrayed thee long ago if I had wished it." 
 "Most true it is," said the king, "that there will be one brave
 man the less in England if thou art slain;  I will now offer thee to make
 thee the foremost baron in England, and to be at my court and rule it
 all;  or I will give thee, if thou wilt not choose that, three pounds
 income every twelvemonths, and be wherever in England it seems good to
 thee."  Heming thanked the king for his offers, and said, "I will
 take that, to be in England, but goods I have no lust to have henceforth; 
 but this I will beg of you, that you give me leave and give me this same cell,
 and here will I end my days."  The king was silent a long time, and
 said "For that this is asked of a clean heart, then shall it be granted
 thee."  After that William let them clothe the body of king Harold
 with royal robes, and made his burial the most seemly, and he was buried with
 the greatest honour.  A little after Heming went into the above named cell
 and served God till his old age, and at last he was sightless and died in that
 hermitage.</p>
