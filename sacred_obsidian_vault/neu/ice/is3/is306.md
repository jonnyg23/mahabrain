 <p>      When bishop John died in Caithness, he whom
 earl Harold caused to be maimed, a man called Adam was chosen bishop in his
 stead;  and no one knew his stock, for the child had been found at some
 church door.  The Caithnesingers thought him rather hard in the
 bishoprick;  and they laid most of the blame of that on a monk who was
 with him.  It was an old custom that the bishop should have a span of butter
 for every thirty kine;  this each householder was to pay who was in
 Caithness;  he more who had more kine, but he less according to his
 means;  and each was to pay according to the tale of his kine.  But
 bishop Adam wished to raise the tax and have a span for every fifteen
 kine;  and when he got that he claimed to have it for every twelve
 kine;  and when that was given up he wished to have it for every ten
 kine.  But that all thought something unheard of.  Then the
 Caithnesingers fared to find earl John, he was then in Caithness, and raised
 this matter with him.  The earl said he could give them no advice; 
 and beside that he thought it concerned him very little;  he said two bad
 things were before them;  that it was unbearable, but said he could not
 suggest another choice.  Bishop Adam was then at the High church [Halkirk]
 in Thorsdale, but earl John was a little way off.  The Caithnesingers then
 held a Thing on the fell above the homestead in which the earl was.  Rafn
 the lawman was then with the bishop, and he prayed the bishop rather to spare
 the men, also he said he was afraid how things might go.  The bishop bade
 him be quiet, and said the freemen would calm down of themselves.  Then a
 message was sent to earl John with a prayer that he would reconcile the bishop
 and the freemen;  but the earl would come never near the spot.  Then
 the freemen ran down from the fell and fared hotly and eagerly.  And when
 Rafn the lawman saw that he bade the bishop devise some plan to save
 himself.  He and the bishop were drinking in a loft.  And when the
 freemen came to the loft, the monk went out at the door;  and was
 straightway smitten across the face, and fell down dead inside the loft. 
 And when the bishop was told that he answered:  "That had not
 happened sooner than was likely, for he was always making our matters
 worse."  Then the bishop bade Rafn tell the freemen that he wished to
 be reconciled with them.  But when this was told to the freemen, all those
 among them who were wiser were glad to hear it.  Then the bishop went out
 and meant to be reconciled.  But when the worse kind of men saw that,
 those who were most mad, they seized bishop Adam, and brought him into a little
 house, and set fire to it.  But the house burnt so quickly that they who
 wished to save the bishop could do nothing.  Thus bishop Adam died, and
 his body was little burnt when it was found.  Then a fitting grave was
 bestowed on it and a worthy burial.  But those men who had been the
 greatest friends of the bishop, they then sent men to find the king of
 Scots.  Alexander was then king of Scots, the son of king William the
 saint.  But when the king was ware of these tidings ............. so ill
 that men have those miseries in mind which he wrought after the burning of the
 bishop in maiming of men and manslaying, and loss of goods and banishment of
 men out of the land.</p>
 
 <p>      And now we cannot tell more certainly of
 those tidings which belong to the earls of the Orkneyingers than just as we
 have said.</p>
