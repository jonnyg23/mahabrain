 <h1 align="CENTER">145. OF KARI AND THORGEIR</h1>
 <p>Those two, Kari Solmund's son and Thorgeir Craggeir, rode that day east across Markfleet, and so on east to Selialandsmull. They found there some women. The wives knew them, and said to them, "Ye two are less wanton than the sons of Sigfus yonder, but still ye fare unwarily."</p>
 <p>"Why do ye talk thus of the sons of Sigfus, or what do ye know about them?"</p>
 <p>"They were last night," they said, "at Raufarfell, and meant to get to Myrdale to-night, but still we thought they must have some fear of you, for they asked when ye would be likely to come home."</p>
 <p>Then Kari and Thorgeir went on their way and spurred their horses.</p>
 <p>"What shall we lay down for ourselves to do now," said Thorgeir, "or what is most to thy mind? Wilt thou that we ride on their track?"</p>
 <p>"I will not hinder this," answers Kari, "nor will I say what ought to be done, for it may often be that those live long who are slain with words alone (1); but I well know what thou meanest to take on thyself, thou must mean to take on thy hands eight men, and after all that is less than it was when thou slewest those seven in the sea-crags (2), and let thyself down by a rope to get at them; but it is the way with all you kinsmen, that ye always wish to be doing some famous feat, and now I can do no less than stand by thee and have my share in the story. So now we two alone will ride after them, for I see that thou hast so made up thy mind."</p>
 <p>After that they rode east by the upper way, and did not pass by Holt, for Thorgeir would not that any blame should be laid at his brother's door for what might be done.</p>
 <p>Then they rode east to Myrdale, and there they met a man who had turf-panniers on his horse. He began to speak thus, "Too few men, messmate Thorgeir, hast thou now in thy company."</p>
 <p>"How is that?" says Thorgeir.</p>
 <p>"Why," said the other, "because the prey is now before thy hand. The sons of Sigfus rode by a while ago, and mean to sleep the whole day east in Carlinedale, for they mean to go no farther to-night than to Headbrink."</p>
 <p>After that they rode on their way east on Arnstacks heath, and there is nothing to be told of their journey before they came to Carlinedale-water.</p>
 <p>The stream was high, and now they rode up along the river, for they saw there horses with saddles. They rode now thitherward, and saw that there were men asleep in a dell and their spears were standing upright in the ground a little below them. They took the spears from them, and threw them into the river.</p>
 <p>Then Thorgeir said, "Wilt thou that we wake them?"</p>
 <p>"Thou hast not asked this," answers Kari, "because thou hast not already made up thy mind not to fall on sleeping men, and so to slay a shameful manslaughter."</p>
 <p>After that they shouted to them, and then they all awoke and grasped at their arms.</p>
 <p>They did not fall on them till they were armed.</p>
 <p>Thorgeir Craggeir runs thither where Thorkell Sigfus' son stood, and just then a man ran behind his back, but before he could do Thorgeir any hurt, Thorgeir lifted the axe, "the ogress of war," with both hands, and dashed the hammer of the axe with a back- blow into the head of him that stood behind him, so that his skull was shattered to small bits.</p>
 <p>"Slain is this one," said Thorgeir; and down the man fell at once, and was dead.</p>
 <p>But when he dashed the axe forward, he smote Thorkell on the shoulder, and hewed it off, arm and all.</p>
 <p>Against Kari came Mord Sigfus' son, and Sigmund Sigfus' son, and Lambi Sigurd's son; the last ran behind Kari's back, and thrust at him with a spear; Kari caught sight of him, and leapt up as the blow fell, and stretched his legs far apart, and so the blow spent itself on the ground, but Kari jumped down on the spear- shaft, and snapped it in sunder. He had a spear in one hand, and a sword in the other, but no shield. He thrust with the right hand at Sigmund Sigfus' son, and smote him on his breast, and the spear came out between his shoulders, and down he fell and was dead at once, With his left hand he made a cut at Mord, and smote him on the hip, and cut it asunder, and his backbone too; he fell flat on his face, and was dead at once.</p>
 <p>After that he turned sharp round on his heel like a whipping-top, and made at Lambi Sigurd's son, but he took the only way to save himself, and that was by running away as hard as he could.</p>
 <p>Now Thorgeir turns against Leidolf the Strong, and each hewed at the other at the same moment, and Leidolf's blow was so great that it shore off that part of the shield on which it fell.</p>
 <p>Thorgeir had hewn with "the ogress of war," holding it with both hands, and the lower horn fell on the shield and clove it in twain, but the upper caught the collarbone and cut it in two and tore on down into the breast and trunk. Kari came up just then, and cut off Leidolf's leg at mid-thigh, and then Leidolf fell and died at once.</p>
 <p>Kettle of the Mark said, "We will now run for our horses, for we cannot hold our own here, for the overbearing strength of these men."</p>
 <p>Then they ran for their horses, and leapt on their backs; and Thorgeir said, "Wilt thou that we chase them? If so, we shall yet slay some of them."</p>
 <p>"He rides last," says Kari, "whom I would not wish to slay, and that is Kettle of the Mark, for we have two sisters to wife; and besides, he has behaved best of all of them as yet in our quarrels."</p>
 <p>Then they got on their horses, and rode till they came home to Holt. Then Thorgeir made his brothers fare away east to Skoga, for they had another farm there, and because Thorgeir would not that his brothers should be called truce-breakers.</p>
 <p>Then Thorgeir kept many men there about him, so that there were never fewer than thirty fighting men there.</p>
 <p>Then there was great joy there, and men thought Thorgeir had grown much greater, and pushed himself on; both he and Kari too. Men long kept in mind this hunting of theirs, how they rode upon fifteen men and slew those five, but put those ten to flight who got away.</p>
 <p>Now it is to be told of Kettle, that they rode as they best might till they came home to Swinefell, and told how bad their journey had been.</p>
 <p>Flosi said it was only what was to be looked for; "And this is a warning that ye should never do the like again."</p>
 <p>Flosi was the merriest of men, and the best of hosts, and it is so said that he had most of the chieftain in him of all the men of his time.</p>
 <p>He was at home that summer, and the winter too.</p>
 <p>But that winter, after Yule, Hall of the Side came from the east, and Kol his son. Flosi was glad at his coming, and they often talked about the matter of the burning. Flosi said they had already paid a great fine, and Hall said it was pretty much what he had guessed would come of Flosi's and his friends' quarrel. Then he asked him what counsel he thought best to be taken, and Hall answers, "The counsel is, that thou beest atoned with Thorgeir if there be a choice, and yet he will be hard to bring to take any atonement."</p>
 <p>"Thinkest thou that the manslaughters will then be brought to an end?" asks Flosi.</p>
 <p>"I do not think so," says Hall; "but you will have to do with fewer foes if Kari be left alone; but if thou art not atoned with Thorgeir, then that will be thy bane."</p>
 <p>"What atonement shall we offer him?" asks Flosi.</p>
 <p>"You will all think that atonement hard," says Hall, "which he will take, for he will not hear of an atonement unless he be not called on to pay any fine for what he has just done, but he will have fines for Njal and his sons, so far as his third share goes."</p>
 <p>"That is a hard atonement," says Flosi.</p>
 <p>"For thee at least," says Hall, "that atonement is not hard, for thou hast not the blood-feud after the sons of Sigfus; their brothers have the blood-feud, and Hammond the Halt after his son; but thou shalt now get an atonement from Thorgeir, for I will now ride to his house with thee, and Thorgeir will in anywise receive me well: but no man of those who are in this quarrel will dare to sit in his house on Fleetlithe if they are out of the atonement, for that will be their bane; and, indeed, with Thorgeir's turn of mind, it is only what must be looked for."</p>
 <p>Now the sons of Sigfus were sent for, and they brought this business before them; and the end of their speech was, on the persuasion of Hall, that they all thought what he said right, and were ready to be atoned.</p>
 <p>Grani Gunnar's son and Gunnar Lambi's son, said, "It will be in our power, if Kari be left alone behind, to take care that he be not less afraid of us than we of him."</p>
 <p>"Easier said than done," says Hall, "and ye will find it a dear bargain to deal with him. Ye will have to pay a heavy fine before you have done with him."</p>
 <p>After that they ceased speaking about it.</p>
 <p>ENDNOTES:</p>
 <p>(1) "With words alone." The English proverb, "Threatened men live long."</p>
 <p>(2) "Sea crags." Hence Thorgeir got his surname "Craggeir."</p>
