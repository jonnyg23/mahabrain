 <h1 align="CENTER">52. OF RUNOLF, THE SON OF WOLF AURPRIEST</h1>
 <p>There was a man named Runolf, the son of Wolf Aurpriest, he kept house at the Dale, east of Markfleet. He was Otkell's guest once when he rode from the Thing. Otkell gave him an ox, all black, without a spot of white, nine winters old. Runolf thanked him for the gift, and bade him come and see him at home whenever he chose to go; and this bidding stood over for some while, so that he had not paid the visit. Runolf often sent men to him and put him in mind that he ought to come; and he always said he would come, but never went.</p>
 <p>Now Otkell had two horses, dun coloured, with a black stripe down the back; they were the best steeds to ride in all the country round, and so fond of each other that whenever one went before the other ran after him.</p>
 <p>There was an Easterling staying with Otkell, whose name was Audulf; he had set his heart on Signy, Otkell's daughter. Audulf was a tall man in growth, and strong.</p>
