 <h1 align="CENTER">32. GUNNAR COMES OUT TO ICELAND</h1>
 <p>When the spring came, the Earl asks Gunnar what course he meant to take. He said he would go to Iceland. The Earl said that had been a bad year for grain, "and there will be little sailing out to Iceland, but still thou shalt have meal and timber both in thy ship."</p>
 <p>Gunnar fitted out his ship as early as he could, and Hallvard fared out with him and Kolskegg. They came out early in the summer, and made Arnbael's Oyce before the Thing met.</p>
 <p>Gunnar rode home from the ship, but got men to strip her and lay her up. But when they came home all men were glad to see them. They were blithe and merry to their household, nor had their haughtiness grown while they were away.</p>
 <p>Gunnar asks if Njal were at home; and he was told that he was at home; then he let them saddle his horse, and those brothers rode over to Bergthorsknoll.</p>
 <p>Njal was glad at their coming, and begged them to stay there that night, and Gunnar told him of his voyages.</p>
 <p>Njal said he was a man of the greatest mark, "and thou hast been much proved; but still thou wilt be more tried hereafter; for many will envy thee."</p>
 <p>"With all men I would wish to stand well," says Gunnar.</p>
 <p>"Much bad will happen," said Njal, "and thou wilt always have some quarrel to ward off."</p>
 <p>"So be it, then," says Gunnar, "so that I have a good ground on my side."</p>
 <p>"So will it be too," says NjaI, "if thou hast not to smart for others."</p>
 <p>Njal asked Gunnar if he would ride to the Thing. Gunnar said he was going to ride thither, and asks Njal whether he were going to ride; but he said he would not ride thither, "and if I had my will thou wouldst do the like."</p>
 <p>Gunnar rode home, and gave Njal good gifts, and thanked him for the care he had taken of his goods. Kolskegg urged him on much to ride to the Thing, saying, "There thy honour will grow, for many will flock to see thee there."</p>
 <p>"That has been little to my mind," says Gunnar, "to make a show of myself; but I think it good and right to meet good and worthy men."</p>
 <p>Hallvard by this time was also come thither, and offered to ride to the thing with them.</p>
