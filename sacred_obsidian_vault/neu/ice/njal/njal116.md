 <h1 align="CENTER">116. OF FLOSI AND MORD AND THE SONS OF SIGFUS</h1>
 <p>The sons of Sigfus heard how Flosi was at Holtford, and they rode thither to meet him, and there were Kettle of the Mark, and Lambi his brother, Thorkell and Mord, the sons of Sigfus, Sigmund their brother, and Lambi Sigurd's son, and Gunnar Lambi's son, and Grani Gunnar's son, and Vebrand Hamond's son.</p>
 <p>Flosi stood up to meet them, and greeted them gladly. So they went down the river. Flosi had the whole story from them about the slaying, and there was no difference between them and Kettle of the Mark's story.</p>
 <p>Flosi spoke to Kettle of the Mark, and said, "This now I ask of thee; how tightly are your hearts knit as to this suit, thou and the other sons of Sigfus?"</p>
 <p>"My wish is," said Kettle, "that there should be peace between us, but yet I have sworn an oath not to part from this suit till it has been brought somehow to an end; and to lay my life on it."</p>
 <p>"Thou art a good man and true," said Flosi, "and it is well to have such men with one."</p>
 <p>Then Grani Gunnar's son and Lambi Sigurd's son both spoke together, and said, "We wish for outlawry and death."</p>
 <p>"It is not given us," said Flosi, "both to share and choose, we must take what we can get."</p>
 <p>"I have had it in my heart," says Grani, "ever since they slew Thrain by Markfleet, and after that his son Hauskuld, never to be atoned with them by a lasting peace, for I would willingly stand by when they were all slain, every man of them."</p>
 <p>"Thou hast stood so near to them," said Flosi, "that thou mightest have avenged these things hadst thou had the heart and manhood. Methinks thou and many others now ask for what ye would give much money hereafter never to have had a share in. I see this clearly, that though we slay Njal or his sons, still they are men of so great worth, and of such good family, that there will be such a blood feud and hue and cry after them, that we shall have to fall on our knees before many a man, and beg for help, ere we get an atonement and find our way out of this strait. Ye may make up your minds, then, that many will become poor who before had great goods, but some of vou will lose both goods and life."</p>
 <p>Mord Valgard's son rode to meet Flosi, and said he would ride to the Thing with him with all his men. Flosi took that well, and raised a matter of a wedding with him, that he should give away Rannveiga his daughter to Starkad Flosi's brother's son, who dwelt at Staffell. Flosi did this because he thouoht he would so make sure both of his faithfulness and force.</p>
 <p>Mord took the wedding kindly, but handed the matter over to Gizur the White, and bade him talk about it at the Thing.</p>
 <p>Mord had to wife Thorkatla, Gizur the White's daughter.</p>
 <p>They two, Mord and Flosi, rode both together to the Thing, and talked the whole day, and no man knew aught of their counsel.</p>
