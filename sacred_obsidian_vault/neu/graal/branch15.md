 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XV</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Here the story is silent of Lancelot, and talketh of Messire
 Gawain that goeth to seek Perceval, and is right heavy for that
 twice hath he found him when he knew him not.  He cometh back
 again to the cross whereas he told Lancelot he would await him so
 he should come thither before him.  He went and came to and fro
 by the forest more than eight days to wait for him, but could
 hear no tidings.  He would not return to King Arthur's court, for
 had he gone thither in such case, he would have had blame
 thereof.  He goeth back upon the quest and saith that he will
 never stint therein until he shall have found both Lancelot and
 Perceval.  He cometh to the hermitage of Joseus, and alighted of
 his horse and found the young hermit Joseus, that received him
 well and made full great joy of him.  He harboured the night
 therewithin.  Messire Gawain asked him tidings of Perceval, and
 the hermit telleth him he hath not seen him since before the
 assembly of the Red Launde.
 </p><p>
 "And can you tell me where I may find him?" saith Messire Gawain. 
 </p><p>
 "Not I," saith the hermit, "I cannot tell you whereabout he is." 
 </p><p>
 While they were talking on this wise, straightway behold you a
 knight coming that hath arms of azure, and alighteth at the
 hermitage to lodge there.  The hermit receiveth him right gladly.
 Messire Gawain asketh him if he saw a knight with white arms ride
 amidst the forest.
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith the knight, "I have seen him this day and
 spoken with him, and he asked me and I could tell him tidings of
 a knight that beareth a shield of sinople with a golden eagle,
 and I told him, no.  Afterward, I enquired wherefore he asked it,
 and he made answer that he had jousted at him in the Red Launde,
 nor never before had he found so sturdy assault of any knight,
 wherefore he was right sorrowful for that he was not acquainted
 with him, for the sake of his good knighthood."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Gawain, "The knight is more sorrowful than
 he, for nought is there in the world he would gladlier see than
 him."
 </p><p>
 The knight espieth Messire Gawain's shield and saith, "Ha, Sir,
 methinketh you are he."
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith Messire Gawain, "you say true.  I am he against
 whom he jousted, and right glad am I that so good a knight smote
 upon my shield, and right sorrowful for that I knew him not; but
 tell me where I may find him?"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Joseus the Hermit, "He will not have gone forth from
 this forest, for this is the place wherein he wonneth most
 willingly, and the shield that he brought from King Arthur's
 court is in this chapel."
 </p><p>
 So he showeth the shield to Messire Gawain that maketh great joy
 thereof.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir," saith the knight of the white arms, "Is your name
 Messire Gawain?"
 </p><p>
 "Fair Sir," saith he, "Gawain am I called."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "I have not ceased to seek you for a
 long while past.  Meliot of Logres, that is your man, the son of
 the lady that was slain on your account, sendeth you word that
 Nabigant of the Rock hath slain his father on your account;
 wherefore he challengeth the land that hath fallen to him; and
 hereof he prayeth you that you will come to succour him as
 behoveth lord to do to his liege man."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Messire Gawain, "Behoveth me not fail him
 therein, wherefore tell him I will succour him so soon as I may;
 but tell him I have emprised a business that I cannot leave but
 with loss of honour until such time as it be achieved."
 </p><p>
 They lay the night at the hermitage until after mass was sung on
 the morrow.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 The knight departed and Messire Gawain remained.  So when he was
 apparelled to mount, he looketh before him at the issue of the
 forest toward the hermitage, and seeth coming a knight on a tall
 horse, full speed and all armed, and he bore a shield like the
 one he saw Perceval bearing the first time.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Know you this knight that cometh there!"
 </p><p>
 "Truly, Sir, well do I know him.  This is Perceval whom you seek,
 whom you so much desire to see!"
 </p><p>
 "God be praised thereof!" saith Messire Gawain, "Inasmuch as he
 cometh hither."
 </p><p>
 He goeth afoot to meet him, and Perceval alighteth so soon as he
 seeth him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "Right welcome may you be!"
 </p><p>
 "Good joy may you have," saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "Make great joy of him!  this is Messire
 Gawain, King Arthur's nephew."
 </p><p>
 "Thereof do I love him the better!" saith he. "Honour and joy
 ought all they to do him that know him!"
 </p><p>
 He throweth his arms on his neck, and so maketh him great joy. 
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Can you tell me tidings of a knight that was in
 the Red Launde at the assembly of knights?"
 </p><p>
 "What shield beareth he?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "A red shield with a golden eagle," saith Perceval.  "And more by
 token, never made I acquaintance with any so sturdy in battle as
 are he and Lancelot."
 </p><p>
 "Fair sir, it pleaseth you to say so," saith Messire Gawain. "In
 the Red Launde was I at the assembly, and such arms bore I as
 these you blazon, and I jousted against a knight in white arms,
 of whom I know this, that all of knighthood that may be lodged in
 the body of a man is in him."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Perceval to Messire Gawain, "You know not how to
 blame any man."
 </p><p>
 So they hold one another by the hands, and go into the hermitage. 
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Messire Gawain, "When you were in the court of King
 Arthur for the shield that is within yonder, your sister was also
 there, and prayed and besought the help of the knight that should
 bear away the shield, as being the most discounselled damsel in
 the world.  The King granted it her, and you bore away the
 shield.  She asked your aid of the King as she that deemed not
 you were her brother, and said that if the King failed of his
 covenant, he would do great sin, whereof would he have much
 blame.  The King was fain to do all he might to seek you, to make
 good that he had said, and sent us forth in quest of you, so that
 the quest lieth between me and Lancelot.  He himself would have
 come had we been unwilling to go.  Sir, I have found you three
 times without knowing you, albeit great desire had I to see you.
 This is the fourth time and I know you now, whereof I make myself
 right joyous; and much am I beholden to you of the fair lodging
 your mother gave me at Camelot; but right sore pity have I of
 her, for a right worshipful woman is she, and a widow lady and
 ancient, and fallen into much war without aid nor comfort,
 through the evil folk that harass her and reave her of her
 castles.  She prayed me, weeping the while right sweetly, that
 and if I should find you that are her son, I should tell you of
 her plight, that your father is dead, and that she hath no
 succour nor aid to look for save from you alone, and if you
 succour her not shortly, she will lose her own one castle that
 she holdeth, and must needs become a beggar, for of the fifteen
 castles she wont to have in your father's time, she hath now only
 that of Camelot, nor of all her knights hath she but five to
 guard the castle.  Wherefore I pray you on her behalf and for
 your own honour, that you will grant her herein of your counsel
 and your valour and your might, for of no chivalry that you may
 do may you rise to greater worship.  And so sore need hath she
 herein as you hear me tell, nor would I that she should lose
 aught by default of message, for thereof should I have sin and
 she harm, and you yourself also, that have the power to amend it
 and ought of right so to do!"
 </p><p>
 "Well have you delivered yourself herein," saith Perceval, "And
 betimes will I succour her and our Lord God will."
 </p><p>
 "You will do honour to yourself," saith Messire Gawain.  "Thereof
 will you have praise with God and worship with the world."
 </p><p>
 "Well know I," saith Perceval, "that in me ought she to have aid
 and counsel as of right, and that so I do not accordingly, I
 ought to have reproach and be blamed as recreant before the
 world."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 "In God's name," saith the hermit, "you speak according to the
 scripture, for he that honoureth not his father and mother
 neither believeth in God nor loveth Him."
 </p><p>
 "All this know I well," saith Perceval, "And well pleased am I to
 be reminded thereof, and well know I also mine intent herein,
 albeit I tell it to none.  But if any can tell me tidings of
 Lancelot, right willingly shall I hear them, and take it kindly
 of the teller thereof."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Joseus, "It is but just now since he lay here
 within, and asked me tidings of Messire Gawain, and I told him
 such as I knew.  Another time before that, he lay here when the
 robbers assailed us that he hanged in the forest, and so hated is
 he thereof of their kinsfolk that and they may meet him, so they
 have the might, he is like to pay for it right dear, and in this
 forest won they rather than in any other.  I told him as much,
 but he made light thereof in semblant, even as he will in deed
 also if their force be not too great."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Perceval, "I will not depart forth of this
 forest until I know tidings of him, if Messire Gawain will pledge
 himself thereto."
 </p><p>
 And Messire saith he desireth nothing better, sith that he hath
 found Perceval, for he may not be at ease until such time as he
 shall know tidings of Lancelot, for he hath great misgiving sith
 that he hath enemies in the forest.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 Perceval and Messire Gawain sojourned that day in the forest in
 the hermitage, and the morrow Perceval took his shield that he
 brought from King Arthur's court, and left that which he brought
 with him, and Messire Gawain along with him that made himself
 right joyous of his company.  They ride amidst the forest both
 twain, all armed, and at the right hour of noon they meet a
 knight that was coming a great gallop as though he were all
 scared.  Perceval asketh him whence he cometh, that he seemeth so
 a-dread.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I come from the forest of the robbers that won in this
 forest wherethrough you have to pass.  They have chased me a full
 league Welsh to slay me, but they would not follow me further for
 a knight that they have beset in one of their holds, that hath
 done them right sore mischief, for he hath hanged four of their
 knights and slain one, as well as the fairest damsel that was in
 the kingdom.  But right well had she deserved the death for that
 she harboured knights with fair semblant and showed them much
 honour, and afterward brought about their death and destruction,
 between herself and a dwarf that she hath, that slew the
 knights."
 </p><p>
 "And know you who is the knight?" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "Not I, for no leisure had I to ask him,
 for sorer need had I to flee than to stay.  But I tell you that
 on account of the meat that failed him in the hold wherein they
 beset him, he issued forth raging like a lion, nor would he have
 suffered himself be shut up so long but for two wounds that he
 had upon his body; for he cared not to issue forth of the house
 until such time as they were healed, and also for that he had no
 horse.  And so soon as he felt himself whole, he ventured himself
 against the four knights, that were so a-dread of him that they
 durst not come a-nigh.  And moreover he deigneth not to go
 a-foot, wherefore if they now come a-nigh, it may not be but he
 shall have one at least out of their four horses, but they hold
 them heedfully aloof."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Perceval,"Gramercy of these tidings."
 </p><p>
 They were fain to depart from the knight, but said he: "Ha,
 Lords, allow me so much as to see the destruction of this evil
 folk that have wrought such mischief in this forest!  Sir" saith
 he to Messire Gawain, "I am cousin to the Poor Knight of the
 Waste Forest that hath the two poor damsels to sister, there
 where you and Lancelot jousted between you, and when the knight
 that brought you tidings thereof died in the night."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Messire Gawain, "These tidings know I well,
 for you say true, and your company hold I right dear for the love
 of the Poor Knight, for never yet saw I more courteous knight,
 nor more courteous damsels, nor better nurtured, and our Lord God
 grant them as much good as I would they should have."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain made the knight go before, for well knew he the
 robbers' hold, but loath enough had he been to go thither, had
 the knights not followed him behind.  Lancelot was issued forth
 of the hold sword in hand, all armed, angry as a lion.  The four
 knights were upon their horses all armed, but no mind had they
 come a-nigh him, for sore dreaded they the huge buffets he dealt,
 and his hardiment.  One of them came forward before the others,
 and it seemed him shame that they might not vanquish one single
 knight.  He goeth to smite Lancelot a great stroke of his sword
 above in the midst of his head, nor did Lancelot's sword fail of
 its stroke, for before he could draw back, Lancelot dealt him
 such a blow as smote oft all of his leg at the thigh, so that he
 made him leave the saddlebows empty.  Lancelot leapt up on the
 destrier, and now seemed him he was safer than before.  The three
 robber-knights that yet remained whole ran upon him on all sides
 and began to press him of their swords in right sore wrath.
 Thereupon behold you, the knight cometh to the way that goeth to
 the hold and saith to Messire Gawain and Perceval, "Now may you
 hear the dashing of swords and the melly."
 </p><p>
 Therewithal the two good knights smite horse with spur and come
 thither where the three robber-knights were assailing Lancelot.
 Each of the twain smiteth his own so wrathfully that they thrust
 their spears right through their bodies and bear them to the
 ground dead.  Howbeit the third knight was fain to flee, but the
 knight that had come to show Messire Gawain the way took heart
 and hardiment from the confidence of the good knights, and smote
 him as he fled so sore that he pierced him with his spear to the
 heart and toppled him to the ground dead.  And the one whose leg
 Lancelot had lopped off was so trampled underfoot of the knights
 that he had no life in him.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 When Lancelot knew Perceval and Messire Gawain he made great joy
 of them and they of him.
 </p><p>
 "Lancelot," saith Messire Gawain, "This knight that led us hither
 to save your life is cousin to the Poor Knight of the Waste
 Castle, the brother of the two poor damsels that lodged us so
 well.  We will send him these horses, one for the knight that
 shall be the messenger, and the two to the lord of the Waste
 Castle, and this hold that we have taken shall be for the two
 damsels, and so shall we make them safe all the days of their
 life.  This, methinketh, will be well."
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith Perceval, "you speak of great courtesy."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "Messire Gawain hath said, and right
 willingly will I grant him all his wish."
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith the knight, "They have in this forest a hold
 wherein the knights did bestow their plunder, for the sake
 whereof they murdered the passers by.  If the goods remain there
 they will be lost, for therein is so great store as might be of
 much worth to many folk that are poverty-stricken for want
 thereof."
 </p><p>
 They go to the hold and find right great treasure in a cave
 underground, and rich sets of vessels and rich ornaments of cloth
 and armours for horses, that they had thrown the one over another
 into a pit that was right broad.
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith he, "Right well hath it been done to this evil
 folk that is destroyed!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "in like manner would they have dealt with
 me and killed me if they might; whereof no sorrow have I save of
 the damsel that I slew, that was one of the fairest dames of the
 world.  But I slew her not knowingly, for I meant rather to
 strike the knight, but she leapt between us, like the hardiest
 dame that saw I ever."
 </p><p>
 "Sirs," saith the knight, "Perceval and Lancelot, by the counsel
 of Messire Gawain, granted the treasure to the two damsels,
 sisters to the Poor Knight of the Waste Castle, whereupon let
 them send for Joseus the Hermit and bid him guard the treasure
 until they shall come hither."
 </p><p>
 And Joseus said that he would do so, and is right glad that the
 robbers of the forest are made away withal, that had so often
 made assault upon him.  He guarded the treasure and the hold
 right safely in the forest; but the dread and the renown of the
 good knights that had freed the forest went far and wide.  The
 knight that led the three destriers was right joyfully received
 at the Waste Castle; and when he told the message wherewith he
 was charged by Messire Gawain, the Poor Knight and two damsels
 made great joy thereof.  Perceval taketh leave of Messire Gawain
 and Lancelot, and saith that never will he rest again until he
 shall have found his sister and his widow mother.  They durst not
 gainsay him, for they know well that he is right, and he prayeth
 them right sweetly that they salute the King and Queen and all
 the good knights of the court, for, please God, he will go see
 them at an early day.  But first he was fain to fulfil the
 promise King Arthur made to his sister, for he would not that the
 King should be blamed in any place as concerning him, nor by his
 default; and he himself would have the greater blame therein and
 he succoured her not, for the matter touched him nearer than it
 did King Arthur.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 With that the Good Knight departeth, and they commend him to God,
 and he them in like sort.  Messire Gawain and Lancelot go their
 way back toward the court of King Arthur, and Perceval goeth
 amidst strange forests until he cometh to a forest far away,
 wherein, so it seemed him, he had never been before.  And he
 passed through a land that seemed him to have been laid waste,
 for it was all void of folk.  Wild beast only seeth he there,
 that ran through the open country.  He entered into a forest in
 this waste country, and found a hermitage in the combe of a
 mountain.  He alighted without and heard that the hermit was
 singing the service of the dead, and had begun the mass with a
 requiem betwixt him and his clerk.  He looketh and seeth a pall
 spread upon the ground before the altar as though it were over a
 corpse.  He would not enter the chapel armed, wherefore he
 hearkened to the mass from without right reverently, and showed
 great devotion as he that loved God much and was a-dread.  When
 the mass was sung, and the hermit was disarmed of the armour of
 Our Lord, he cometh to Perceval and saluteth him and Perceval him
 again.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Perceval, "For whom have you done such service?
 meseemed that the corpse lay therewithin for whom the service was
 ordained."
 </p><p>
 "You say truth," saith the hermit. "I have done it for Lohot,
 King Arthur's son, that lieth buried under this pall."
 </p><p>
 "Who, then, hath slain him?" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "That will I tell you plainly," saith the hermit.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 "This wasted land about this forest wherethrough you have come is
 the beginning of the kingdom of Logres.  There wont to be therein
 a Giant so big and horrible and cruel that none durst won within
 half a league round about, and he destroyed the land and wasted
 it in such sort as you see. Lohot was departed from the land and
 the court of King Arthur his father in quest of adventure, and by
 the will of God arrived at this forest, and fought against
 Logrin, right cruel as he was, and Logrin against him.  As it
 pleased God, Lohot vanquished him; but Lohot had a marvellous
 custom: when he had slain a man, he slept upon him.  A knight of
 King Arthur's court, that is called Kay the Seneschal, was come
 peradventure into this forest of Logres.  He heard the Giant roar
 when Lohot dealt him the mortal blow.  Thither came he as fist as
 he might, and found the King's son sleeping upon Logrin.  He drew
 his sword and therewith cut off Lohot's head, and took the head
 and the body and set them in a coffin of stone.  After that he
 hacked his shield to pieces with his sword, that he should not be
 recognised; then came he to the Giant that lay dead, and so cut
 oft his head, that was right huge and hideous, and hung it at his
 fore saddle-bow.  Then went he to the court of King Arthur and
 presented it to him.  The King made great joy thereof and all
 they of the court, and the King made broad his lands right freely
 for that he believed Kay had spoken true.  I went," saith the
 hermit, "on the morrow to the piece of land where the Giant lay
 dead, as a damsel came within here to tell me with right great
 joy.  I found the corpse of the Giant so big that I durst not
 come a-nigh it.  The damsel led me to the coffin where the King's
 son was lying.  She asked the head of me as her guerdon, and I
 granted it to her willingly.  She set it forthwith in a coffer
 laden with precious stones that was all garnished within of
 balsams.  After that, she helped me carry the body into this
 chapel and enshroud and bury it.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 "Afterwards the damsel departed, nor have I never heard talk of
 her since, nor do I make remembrance hereof for that I would King
 Arthur should know it, nor for aught that I say thereof that he
 should do evil to the knight; for right sore sin should I have
 thereof, but deadly treason and disloyalty hath he wrought."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Perceval, "This is sore pity of the King's son, that
 he is dead in such manner, for I have heard witness that he ever
 waxed more and more in great chivalry, and, so the King knew
 thereof, Kay the Seneschal, that is not well-loved of all folk,
 would lose the court for ever more, or his life, so he might be
 taken, and this would be only right and just."
 </p><p>
 Perceval lay the night in the hermitage, and departed on the
 morrow when he had heard mass.  He rideth through the forest as
 he that right gladly would hear tidings of his mother, nor never
 before hath he been so desirous thereof as is he now.  He heard,
 at right hour of noon, a damsel under a tree that made greater
 dole than ever heard he damsel make before.  She held her mule by
 the reins and was alighted a-foot and set herself on her knees
 toward the East.  She stretched her hands up toward heaven and
 prayed right sweetly the Saviour of the World and His sweet
 Mother that they would send her succour betimes, for that the
 most discounselled damsel of the world was she, and never was
 alms given to damsel to counsel her so well bestowed as it would
 be upon her, for that needs must she go to the most perilous
 place that is in the world, and that, save she might bring some
 one with her, never would that she had to do be done.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 Perceval drew himself up when he heard the damsel bemoaning thus.
 He was in the shadow of the forest so that she saw him not.  The
 damsel cried out all weeping, "Ha, King Arthur, great sin did you
 in forgetting to speak of my business to the knight that bare
 away the shield from your court, by whom would my mother have
 been succoured, that now must lose her castle presently save God
 grant counsel herein; and so unhappy am I, that I have gone
 through all the lands of Great Britain, yet may I hear no tidings
 of my brother, albeit they say that he is the Best Knight of the
 world.  But what availeth us his knighthood, when we have neither
 aid nor succour thereof?  So much the greater shame ought he to
 have of himself, if he love his mother, as she, that is the most
 gentle lady that liveth and the most loyal, hath hope that, and
 he knew, he would come thither.  Either he is dead or he is in
 lands so far away that none may hear tidings of him.  Ha, sweet
 Lady, Mother of Our Saviour, aid us when we may have no aid of
 any other!  for if my lady mother loseth her castle, needs must
 we be forlorn wanderers in strange lands, for so have her
 brothers been long time; he that had the most power and valour
 lieth in languishment, the good King Fisherman that the King of
 Castle Mortal warreth on, albeit he also is my uncle, my mother's
 brother, and would fain reave my uncle, that is his brother, of
 his castle by his felony.  Of a man so evil my lady mother
 looketh for neither aid nor succour.  And the good King Pelles
 hath renounced his kingdom for the love of his Saviour, and hath
 entered into a hermitage.  He likewise is brother of my mother,
 and behoveth him make war upon none, for the most worshipful
 hermit is he of the world.  And all they on my father's side have
 died in arms.  Eleven were there of them, and my father was the
 twelfth.  Had they remained on live, well able would they have
 been to succour us, but the knight that was first at the Graal
 hath undone us, for through him our uncle fell in languishment,
 in whom should have been our surest succour."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 At this word Perceval rode forward, and the damsel heareth him.
 She riseth up, and looketh backward and seeth the knight come,
 the shield at his neck banded argent and azure, with a red cross.
 She clasped her two hands toward heaven, and saith, "Ha, sweet
 Lady that didst bear the Saviour of the World, you have not
 forgotten me, nor never may be discounselled he nor she that
 calleth upon you with the heart.  Here see I the knight come of
 whom we shall have aid and succour, and our Lord God grant him
 will to do His pleasure, and lend him courage and strength to
 protect us!"
 </p><p>
 She goeth to meet him, and holdeth his stirrup and would have
 kissed his foot, but he avoideth it and crieth to her: "Ill do
 you herein, damsel!"  And therewith she melteth in tears of
 weeping and prayeth him right sweetly.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Of such pity as God had of His most sweet
 Mother on that day He took His death, when He beheld Her at the
 foot of the cross, have pity and mercy of my lady mother and of
 me.  For, and your aid fail us, we know not to whom to fly for
 rescue, for I have been told that you are the Best Knight of the
 world.  And for obtaining of your help went I to King Arthur's
 court.  Wherefore succour us for pity's sake and God's and for
 nought beside, for, so please you, it is your duty so to do,
 albeit, had you been my brother that is also such a knight as
 you, whom I cannot find, I might have called upon you of a
 greater right.  Sir," saith she, "Do you remember you of the
 brachet you had at the court waiting for you until such time as
 you should come for the shield, and that went away with you, how
 he would never make joy nor know any save me alone?  By this know
 I well that if you knew the soreness of our need you would
 succour us.  But King Arthur, that should have prayed you
 thereof, forgat it."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "so much hath he done that he hath not failed
 of his covenant with you, for he sent for me by the two best
 knights of his court, and. so I may speed, so much will I do
 herein as that God and he shall be well pleased thereof."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII.
 </p><p>
 The damsel had right great joy of the knight that he should grant
 her his aid, but she knew not he was her brother, or otherwise
 she would have doubled her joy.  Perceval knoweth well that she
 is his sister, but he would not yet discover himself and manifest
 his pity outwardly.  He helpeth the damsel to mount again and
 they rode on together.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "Needs must I go to-night by myself to
 the Grave-yard Perilous."
 </p><p>
 "Wherefore go you thither?" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I have made vow thereof, and moreover a holy
 hermit hath told me that the knight that warreth upon us may not
 be overcome of no knight, save I bring him not some of the cloth
 wherewith the altar in the chapel of the Grave-yard Perilous is
 covered.  The cloth is of the most holiest, for our Lord God was
 covered therewith in the Holy Sepulchre, on the third day when He
 came back from death to life.  Nor none may enter the holy
 grave-yard that bringeth another with him, wherefore behoveth me
 go by myself, and may God save my life this night, for the place
 is sore perilous, and so ought I greatly to hate him that hath
 procured me this dolour and travail.  Sir," saith she, "You will
 go your way toward the castle of Camelot: there is the Widow Lady
 my mother, that awaiteth the return and the succour of the Good
 Knight, and may you remember to succour and aid us when you shall
 see how sore is our need of succour.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIII.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Perceval, "So God allow me I will aid you to the
 utmost of my power."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "See, this is my way, that is but little
 frequented, for I tell you that no knight durst tread therein
 without great peril and great dread.  And our Lord God have your
 body in keeping, for mine own this night shall be in sore
 jeopardy and hazard."
 </p><p>
 Perceval departeth from the damsel, his sister, and hath right
 great pity for that she goeth in so perilous place all alone.
 Natheless would he nor forbid her, for he knew well that she
 might not go thither with him nor with other, sith that such was
 the custom of the grave-yard that twain might not pass the
 entrance, wherefore needs must one remain without.  Perceval was
 not willing that his sister should break her vow, for never none
 of his lineage did at any time disloyalty nor base deed
 knowingly, nor failed of nought that they had in covenant, save
 only the King of Castle Mortal, from whom he had as much evil as
 he had good of the others.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIV.
 </p><p>
 The damsel goeth her way all alone and all forlorn toward the
 grave-yard and the deep of the forest, all dark and shadowy.  She
 hath ridden until the sun was set and the night draweth nigh. 
 She looketh before her and seeth a cross, high and wide and
 thick.  And on this cross was the figure of Our Lord graven,
 whereof is she greatly comforted.  She draweth nigh the cross,
 and so kisseth and adoreth it, and prayeth the Saviour of the
 world that was nailed on Holy Rood that He would bring her forth
 of the burial-ground with honour.  The cross was at the entrance
 of the grave-yard, that was right spacious, for, from such time
 as the land was first peopled of folk, and that knights began to
 seek adventure by the forest, not a knight had died in the
 forest, that was full great of breadth and length, but his body
 was borne thither, nor might never knight there be buried that
 had not received baptism and had repented him not of his sins at
 his death.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XV.
 </p><p>
 Thereinto entered the damsel all alone, and found great multitude
 of tombs and coffins.  Nor none need wonder whether she had
 shuddering and fear, for such place must needs be dreadful to a
 lonely damsel, there where lay so many knights that had been
 slain in arms.  Josephus the good clerk witnesseth us that within
 the grave-yard might no evil spirit meddle, for that Saint Andrew
 the apostle had blessed it with his hand.  But never might no
 hermit remain within for the evil things that appeared each night
 all round about, that took the shapes of the knights that were
 dead in the forest, wherof the bodies lay not in the blessed
 burial-ground.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVI.
 </p><p>
 The damsel beholdeth their sepulchres all round about the grave-
 yard whereinto she was come.  She seeth them surrounded of
 knights, all black, and spears had they withal, and came one
 against another, and made such uproar and alarm as it seemed all
 the forest resounded thereof.  The most part held swords all red
 as of fire, and ran either upon other, and gashed one another's
 hands and feet and nose and face.  And great was the clashing
 they made, but they could not come a-nigh the grave-yard.  The
 damsel seeth them, and hath such affright thereof that she nigh
 fell to the ground in a swoon.  The mule whereon she sate draweth
 wide his nostrils and goeth in much fear.  The damsel signeth her
 of the cross and commendeth her to the Saviour and to His sweet
 Mother.  She looketh before her to the head of the grave-yard,
 and seeth the chapel, small and ancient.  She smiteth her mule
 with her whip, and cometh thitherward and alighteth.  She entered
 therewithin and found a great brightness of light.  Within was an
 image of Our Lady, to whom she prayeth right sweetly that She
 will preserve her senses and her life and enable her to depart in
 safety from this perilous place.  She seeth above the altar the
 most holy cloth for the which she was come thither, that was
 right ancient, and a smell came thereof so sweet and glorious
 that no sweetness of the world might equal it.  The damsel cometh
 toward the altar thinking to take the cloth, but it goeth up into
 the air as if the wind had lifted it, and was so high that she
 might not reach it above an ancient crucifix that was there
 within.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God!" saith the damsel, "It is for my sin and my disloyalty
 that this most holy cloth thus draweth itself away from me!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVII.
 </p><p>
 "Fair Father God, never did I evil to none, nor never did I shame
 nor sinned deadly in myself, nor never wrought against your will,
 so far as in me lay, but rather do I serve you and love and fear
 you and your sweet Mother; and all the tribulation I receive,
 accept I in patience for your love, for well I know that such is
 your pleasure, nor have I no will to set myself against nought
 that pleaseth you.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVIII.
 </p><p>
 "When it shall please you, you will release me and my mother of
 the grief and tribulation wherein we are.  For well you know that
 they have reaved her of her castles by wrong, and of her land,
 for that she is a Widow Lady without help.  Lord, you who have
 all the world at your mercy and do your commandment in all
 things, grant me betimes to hear tidings of my brother and he be
 on live, for sore need have we of him.  And so lend force to the
 knight and power against all our enemies, that for your love and
 for pity is fain to succour and aid my mother that is sore
 discounselled.  Lord, well might it beseem you to remember of
 your pity and the sweetness that is in you, and of compassion
 that she hath been unrighteously disherited, and that no succour
 nor aid nor counsel hath she, save of you alone.  You are her
 affiance and her succour, and therefore ought you to remember
 that the good knight Joseph of Abarimacie, that took down your
 Body when it hung upon the rood, was her own uncle.  Better loved
 he to take down your Body than all the gold and all the fee that
 Pilate might give him.  Lord, good right of very truth had he so
 to do, for he took you in his arms beside the rood, and laid your
 Body in the holy sepulchre, wherein were you covered of the
 sovran cloth for the which have I come in hither.  Lord, grant it
 be your pleasure that I may have it, for love of the knight by
 whom it was set in this chapel; sith that I am of his lineage it
 ought well to manifest itself in this sore need, so it come
 according to your pleasure."
 </p><p>
 Forthwith the cloth came down above the altar, and she
 straightway found taken away therefrom as much as it pleased Our
 Lord she should have.  Josephus telleth us of a truth, that never
 did none enter into the chapel that might touch the cloth save
 only this one damsel.  She set her face to it and her mouth or
 ever the cloth removed.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIX.
 </p><p>
 Thereafter, she took the piece that God would and set it near
 herself full worshipfully, but still the stout went on of the
 evil spirits round about the church-yard, and they dealt one
 another blows so sore that all the forest resounded thereof, and
 it seemed that it was all set on fire of the flame that issued
 from them.  Great fear would the damsel have had of them, had she
 not comforted herself in God and in His dear, sweet Mother, and
 the most holy cloth that was within there.  A Voice appeared upon
 the stroke of midnight from above the chapel, and speaketh to the
 souls whereof the bodies lie within the grave-yard: "How sore
 loss hath befallen you of late, and all other whose bodies lie in
 other hallowed church-yards by the forests of this kingdom!  For
 the good King Fisherman is dead that made every day our service
 be done in the most holy chapel there where the most Holy Graal
 every day appeared, and where the Mother of God abode from the
 Saturday until the Monday that the service was finished.  And now
 hath the King of Castle Mortal seized the castle in such sort
 that never sithence hath the Holy Graal appeared, and all the
 other hallows are hidden, so that none knoweth what hath become
 of the priests that served in the chapel, nor the twelve ancient
 knights, nor the damsels that were therein.  And you, damsel,
 that are within, have no affiance in the aid of strange knight in
 this need, for succoured may you never be save of your brother
 only!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XX.
 </p><p>
 With that the Voice is still, and a wailing and a lamentation
 goeth up from the bodies that lay in the church-yard, so dolorous
 that no man is there in the world but should have pity thereof,
 and all the evil spirits that were without departed groaning and
 making so mighty uproar at their going away that it seemed the
 earth trembled.  The damsel heard the tidings of her uncle that
 was dead, and fell on the ground in a swoon, and when she raised
 herself, took on to lament and cried: "Ha, God!  Now have we lost
 the most comfort and the best friend that we had, and hereof am I
 again discomforted that I may not be succoured in this my next
 need by the Good Knight of whom I thought to have succour and
 aid, and that was so fain to render it.  Now shall I know not
 what to ask of him, for he would grant it right willingly, and
 may God be as pleased with him thereof as if he had done it."
 </p><p>
 The damsel was in sore misdoubting and dismay, for she knew not
 who the knight was, and great misgiving had she of her uncle's
 death and right sore sorrow.  She was in the chapel until it was
 day, and then commended herself to God and departed and mounted
 on her mule and issued forth of the church-yard full speed, all
 alone.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXI.
 </p><p>
 The story saith that the damsel went her way toward her mother's
 castle as straight as she might, but sore dismayed was she of the
 Voice that had told her she might not be succoured save of her
 brother alone.  She hath ridden so far of her journeys that she
 is come to the Valley of Camelot, and seeth her mother's castle
 that was surrounded of great rivers, and seeth Perceval, that was
 alighted under the shadow of a tree at the top of the forest in
 order that he might behold his mother's castle, whence he went
 forth squire what time he slew the Knight of the Red Shield. 
 When he had looked well at the castle and the country round
 about, much pleasure had he thereof, and mounted again forthwith.
 Thereupon, behold you, the damsel cometh.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "In sore travail and jeopardy have I been
 sithence that last I saw you, and tidings have I heard as bad as
 may be, and right grievous for my mother and myself.  For King
 Fisherman mine uncle is dead, and another of my uncles, the King
 of Castle Mortal, hath seized his castle, albeit my lady mother
 ought rather to have it, or I, or my brother."
 </p><p>
 "Is it true " saith Perceval, "that he is dead?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, certes, Sir, I know it of a truth."
 </p><p>
 "So help me God!" saith he, "This misliketh me right sore.  I
 thought not that he would die so soon, for I have not been to see
 him of a long time."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXII.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I am much discomforted as concerning you, for
 I have likewise been told that no force nor aid of any knight may
 avail to succour nor aid me from this day forward save my
 brother's help alone.  Wherefore, and it be so, we have lost all,
 for my lady mother hath respite to be in her castle only until
 the fifteenth day from to-day, and I know not where to seek my
 brother, and the day is so nigh as you hear.  Now behoveth us do
 the best we may and abandon this castle betimes, nor know I any
 refuge that we now may have save only King Pelles in the
 hermitage.  I would fain that my lady mother were there, for he
 would not fail us."
 </p><p>
 Perceval is silent, and hath great pity in his heart of this that
 the damsel saith.  She followeth him weeping, and pointeth out to
 him the Valleys of Camelot and the castles that were shut in by
 combes and mountains, and the broad meadow-lands and the forest
 that girded them about.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "All this hath the Lord of the Moors reaved of
 my lady mother, and nought coveteth he so much as to have this
 castle, and have it he will, betimes."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIII.
 </p><p>
 When they had ridden until that they drew nigh the castle, the
 Lady was at the windows of the hall and knew her daughter.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God!" saith the Lady, "I see there my daughter coming, and a
 knight with her.  Fair Father God, grant of your pleasure that it
 be my son, for and it be not he, I have lost my castle and mine
 heirs are disherited."
 </p><p>
 Perceval cometh nigh the castle in company with his sister, and
 knoweth again the chapel that stood upon four columns of marble
 between the forest and the castle, there where his father told
 him how much ought he to love good knights, and that none earthly
 thing might be of greater worth, and how none might know yet who
 lay in the coffin until such time as the Best Knight of the world
 should come thither, but that then should it be known.  Perceval
 would fain have passed by the chapel, but the damsel saith to
 him: "Sir, no knight passeth hereby save he go first to see the
 coffin within the chapel."
 </p><p>
 He alighteth and setteth the damsel to the ground, and layeth
 down his spear and shield and cometh toward the tomb, that was
 right fair and rich.  He set his hand above it.  So soon as he
 came nigh, the sepulchre openeth on one side, so that one saw him
 that was within the coffin.  The damsel falleth at his feet for
 joy.  The Lady had a custom such that every time a knight stopped
 at the coffin she made the five ancient knights that she had with
 her in the castle accompany her, wherein they would never fail
 her, and bring her as far as the chapel.  So soon as she saw the
 coffin open and the joy her daughter made, she knew that it was
 her son, and ran to him and embraced him and kissed him and began
 to make the greatest joy that ever lady made.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIV.
 </p><p>
 "Now know I well," saith she, "that our Lord God hath not
 forgotten me.  Sith that I have my son again, the tribulations
 and the wrongs that have been done me grieve me not any more.
 Sir," saith she to her son, "Now is it well known and proven that
 you are the Best Knight of the world!  For otherwise never would
 the coffin have opened, nor would any have known who he is that
 you now see openly."
 </p><p>
 She maketh her chaplain take certain letters that were sealed
 with gold in the coffin.  He looketh thereat and readeth, and
 then saith that these letters witness of him that lieth in the
 coffin that he was one of them that helped to un-nail Our Lord
 from the cross.  They looked beside him and found the pincers all
 bloody wherewith the nails were drawn, but they might not take
 them away, nor the body, nor the coffin, according as Josephus
 telleth us, for as soon as Perceval was forth of the chapel, the
 coffin closed again and joined together even as it was before.
 The Widow Lady led her son with right great joy into her castle,
 and recounted to him all the shame that had been done her, and
 also how Messire Gawain had made safe the castle for a year by
 his good knighthood.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXV.
 </p><p>
 "Fair son," saith she, "Now is the term drawn nigh when I should
 have lost my castle and you had not come.  But now know I well
 that it shall be safe-guarded of you.  He that coveteth this
 castle is one of the most outrageous knights on live.  And he
 hath reaved me of my land and the Valleys of Camelot without
 reasonable occasion.  But, please God, you shall well repair the
 harm he hath done you, for nought claim I any longer of the land
 since you are come.  But so avenge your shame as to increase your
 honour, for none ought to allow his right to be minished of an
 evil man, and the mischiefs that have been done me for that I had
 no aid, let them not wax cold in you, for a shame done to one
 valiant and strong ought not to wax cold in him, but rankle and
 prick in him, so ought he to have his enemies in remembrance
 without making semblant, but so much as he shall show in his
 cheer and making semblant and his menaces, so much ought he to
 make good in deed when he shall come in place.  For one cannot do
 too much hurt to an enemy, save only one is willing to let him be
 for God's sake.  But truth it is that the scripture saith, that
 one ought not to do evil to one's enemies, but pray God that He
 amend them.  I would fain that our enemies were such that they
 might amend toward us, and that they would do as much good to us
 without harming themselves as they have done evil, on condition
 that mine anger and yours were foregone against them.  Mine own
 anger I freely forbear against them so far forth as concerneth
 myself, for no need have I to wish evil to none, and Solomon
 telleth how the sinner that curseth other sinner curseth himself
 likewise.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVI.
 </p><p>
 "Fair son, this castle is yours, and this land round about
 whereof I have been reft ought to be yours of right, for it
 falleth to you on behalf of your father and me.  Wherefore send
 to the Lord of the Moors that hath reft it from me, that he
 render it to you.  I make no further claim, for I pass it on to
 you; for nought have I now to do with any land save only so much
 as will be enough wherein to bury my body when I die, nor shall I
 now live much longer since King Fisherman my brother is dead,
 whereof right sorrowful am I at heart, and still more sorrowful
 should I be were it not for your coming.  And, son, I tell you
 plainly that you have great blame of his death, for you are the
 knight through whom he fell first into languishment, for now at
 last I know well that and if you had afterwards gone back and so 
 made the demand that you made not at the first, he would have
 come back to health.  But our Lord God willed it so to be,
 wherefore well beseemeth us to yield to His will and pleasure." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVII.
 </p><p>
 Perceval hath heard his mother, but right little hath he answered
 her, albeit greatly is he pleased with whatsoever she hath said.
 His face is to-flushed of hardiment, and courage hath taken hold
 on him.  His mother looketh at him right fainly, and hath him
 disarmed and apparelled in a right rich robe.  So comely a knight
 was he that in all the world might not be found one of better
 seeming nor better shapen of body.  The Lord of the Moors, that
 made full certain of having his mother's castle, knew of
 Perceval's coming.  He was not at all dismayed in semblant, nor
 would he stint to ride by fell nor forest, and every day he
 weened in his pride that the castle should be his own at the hour
 and the term he had set thereof.  One of the five knights of the
 Widow Lady was one day gone into the Lonely Forest after hart and
 hind, and had taken thereof at his will.  He was returning back
 to the castle and the huntsmen with him, when the Lord of the
 Moors met him and told him he had done great hardiment in
 shooting with the bow in the forest, and the knight made answer
 that the forest was not his of right, but the Lady's of Camelot
 and her son's that had repaired thither.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVIII.
 </p><p>
 The Lord of the Moors waxed wroth.  He held a sword in his hand
 and thrust him therewith through the body and slew him.  The
 knight was borne dead to the castle of Camelot before the Widow
 Lady and her son.
 </p><p>
 "Fair son," saith the Widow Lady, "More presents of such-like
 kind the Lord of the Moors sendeth me than I would.  Never may he
 be satisfied of harming my land and shedding the blood of the
 bodies of my knights.  Now may you well know how many a hurt he
 hath done me sithence that your father hath been dead and you
 were no longer at the castle, sith that this hath he done me even
 now that you are here.  You have the name of Perceval on this
 account, that tofore you were born, he had begun to reave your
 father of the Valleys of Camelot, for your father was an old
 knight and all his brethren were dead, and therefore he gave you
 this name in baptism, for that he would remind you of the
 mischief done to him and to you, and that you might help to
 retrieve it and you should have the power."
 </p><p>
 The Dame maketh shroud the knight, for whom she is full
 sorrowful, and on the morrow hath mass sung and burieth him.
 Perceval made arm two of the old knights with him, then issued
 forth of the castle and entered the great dark forest.  He rode
 until he came before a castle, and met five knights that issued
 forth all armed.  He asked whose men they were.  They answer, the
 Lord's of the Moors, and that he goeth seek the son of the Widow
 Lady that is in the forest.
 </p><p>
 "If we may deliver him up to our lord, good guerdon shal we have
 thereof."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Perceval, "You have not far to seek.  I am
 here!
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIX.
 </p><p>
 Perceval smiteth his horse of his spurs and cometh to the first
 in such sort that he passeth his spear right through his body and
 beareth him to the ground dead.  The other two knights each smote
 his man so that they wounded them in the body right sore.  The
 other two would fain have fled, but Perceval preventeth them, and
 they gave themselves up prisoners for fear of death.  He bringeth
 all four to the castle of Camelot and presenteth them to his lady
 mother.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "see here the quittance for your knight that
 was slain, and the fifth also remaineth lying on the piece of
 ground shent in like manner as was your own."
 </p><p>
 "Fair son," saith she, "I should have better loved peace after
 another sort, and so it might be."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "Thus is it now.  One ought to make war against
 the warrior, and be at peace with the peaceable."
 </p><p>
 The knights are put in prison.  The tidings are come to the Lord
 of the Moors that the son of the Widow Lady hath slain one of his
 knights and carried off four to prison.  Thereof hath he right
 great wrath at heart, and sweareth and standeth to it that never
 will he be at rest until he shall have either taken or slain him,
 and that, so there were any knight in his land that would deliver
 him up, he would give him one of the best castles in his country.
 The more part are keen to take Perceval.  Eight came for that
 intent before him all armed in the forest of Camelot, and hunted
 and drove wild deer in the purlieus of the forest so that they of
 the castle saw them.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXX.
 </p><p>
 Perceval was in his mother's chapel, where he heard mass; and
 when the mass was sung, his sister said: "Fair brother, see here
 the most holy cloth that I brought from the chapel of the
 Grave-yard Perilous.  Kiss it and touch it with your face, for a
 holy hermit told me that never should our land be conquered back
 until such time as you should have hereof."
 </p><p>
 Perceval kisseth it, then toucheth his eyes and face therewith.
 Afterward he goeth to arm him, and the four knights with him;
 then he issueth forth of the chamber and mounteth on his horse,
 then goeth out of the gateway like a lion unchained.  He sitteth
 on a tall horse all covered.  He cometh nigh the eight knights
 that were all armed, man and horse, and asketh them what folk
 they be and what they seek, and they say that they are enemies of
 the Widow Lady and her son.
 </p><p>
 "Then you do I defy!" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 He cometh to them a great run, and the four knights with him, and
 each one overthroweth his own man so roughly that either he is
 wounded in his body or maimed of arm or leg.  The rest held the
 melly to the utmost they might endure.  Perceval made take them
 and bring to the castle, and the other five that they had
 overthrown.  The Lord of the Moors was come to shoot with a bow,
 and he heard the noise of the knights, and cometh thitherward a
 great gallop all armed.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith one of the old knights to Perceval, "Look!  here is
 the Lord of the Moors coming, that hath reft your mother of her
 land and slain her men.  Of him will it be good to take
 vengeance.  See, how boldly he cometh."
 </p><p>
 Perceval looketh on him as he that loveth him not, and cometh
 toward him as hard as his horse may carry him, and smiteth him
 right through the breast so strongly that he beareth to the
 ground him and his horse together all in a heap.  He alighteth to
 the ground and draweth his sword.
 </p><p>
 "How?" saith the Lord of the Moors, "Would you then slay me and
 put me in worse plight than I am?"
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Perceval, "No, nor so swiftly, but I will
 slay you enough, betimes!"
 </p><p>
 "So it seemeth you," saith the Lord of the Moors, "But it shall
 not be yet!"
 </p><p>
 He leapeth up on his feet and runneth on Perceval, sword drawn,
 as one that fain would harm him if he might.  But Perceval
 defendeth himself as good knight should, and giveth such a buffet
 at the outset as smiteth off his arm together with his sword. 
 The knights that came after fled back all discomfited when they
 saw their lord wounded.  And Perceval made lift him on a horse
 and carry him to the castle and presenteth him to his mother. 
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "See here the Lord of the Moors!  Well might
 you expect him eftsoons, sith that you were to have yielded him
 up your castle the day after to-morrow!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXI.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith the Lord of the Moors, "Your son hath wounded me
 and taken my knights and myself likewise.  I will yield you up
 your castle albeit I hold it mine as of right, on condition you
 cry me quit."
 </p><p>
 "And who shall repay her," saith Perceval, "for the shame that
 you have done her, for her knights that you have slain, whereof
 never had you pity?  Now, so help me God, if she have mercy or
 pity upon you, never hereafter will I trouble to come to her aid
 how sore soever may be her need.  Such pity and none other as you
 have had for her and my sister will I have for you.  Our Lord God
 commanded in both the Old Law and the New, that justice should be
 done upon man-slayers and traitors, and justice will I do upon
 you that His commandment be not transgressed."
 </p><p>
 He hath a great vat made ready in the midst of the court, and
 maketh the eleven knights be brought. H e maketh their heads be
 stricken off into the vat and bleed therein as much blood as
 might come from them, and then made the heads and the bodies be
 drawn forth so that nought was there but blood in the vat.  After
 that, he made disarm the Lord of the Moors and be brought before
 the vat wherein was great abundance of blood.  He made bind his
 feet and his hands right strait, and after that saith: "Never
 might you be satisfied of the blood of the knights of my lady
 mother, now will I satisfy you of the blood of your own knights!" 
 </p><p>
 He maketh hang him by the feet in the vat, so that his head were
 in the blood as far as the shoulders, and so maketh him be held
 there until that he was drowned and quenched.  After that, he
 made carry his body and the bodies of the other knights and their
 heads, and made them be cast into an ancient charnel that was
 beside an old chapel in the forest, and the vat together with the
 blood made he be cast into the river, so that the water thereof
 was all bloody.  The tidings came to the castles that the son of
 the Widow Lady had slain the Lord of the Moors and the best of
 his knights.  Thereof were they in sore misgiving, and the most
 part said that the like also would he do to them save they held
 themselves at his commandment.  They brought him the keys of all
 the castles that had been reft of his mother, and all the knights
 that had before renounced their allegiance returned thereunto and
 pledged themselves to be at his will for dread of death.  All the
 land was assured in safety, nor was there nought to trouble the
 Lady's joy save only that King Fisherman her brother was dead,
 whereof she was right sorrowful and sore afflicted.

 </p><p>
 XXXII.
 </p><p>
 One day the Widow Lady sate at meat, and there was great plenty
 of knights in the hall.  Perceval sate him beside his sister.
 Thereupon, behold you the Damsel of the Car that came with the
 other two damsels before the Widow Lady and her son, and saluted
 them right nobly.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Perceval, "Good adventure may you have!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "You have speeded right well of your business
 here, now go speed it elsewhere, for thereof is the need right
 sore.  King Hermit, that is your mother's brother, sendeth you
 word that, and you come not with haste into the land that was
 King Fisherman's your uncle, the New Law that God hath stablished
 will be sore brought low.  For the King of Castle Mortal, that
 hath seized the land and castle, hath made be cried throughout
 all the country how all they that would fain maintain the Old Law
 and abandon the New shall have protection of him and counsel and
 aid, and they that will not shall be destroyed and outlawed."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, fair son," saith the Widow Lady, "Now have you heard the
 great disloyalty of the evil man that is my brother, whereof am I
 right sorrowful, for that he is of my kindred."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Perceval, "Your brother nor my uncle is he no
 longer, sith that he denieth God!  Rather is he our mortal enemy
 that we ought of right to hate more than any stranger!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXIII.
 </p><p>
 "Fair son," saith the Widow Lady, "I pray and beseech you that
 the Law of the Saviour be not set aside in forgetfulness and
 neglect there where you may exalt it, for better Lord in no wise
 may you serve, nor one that better knoweth how to bestow fair
 guerdon.  Fair son, none may be good knight that serveth Him not
 and loveth Him.  Take heed that you be swift in His service nor
 delay not for no intent, but be ever at His commandment alike at
 eventide as in the morning, so shall you not bely your lineage.
 And the Lord God grant you good intent therein and good will to
 go on even as you have begun."
 </p><p>
 The Widow Lady, that much loved her son, riseth up from the
 tables, and all the other knights, and seemeth it that she is
 Lady of her land in such sort as that never was she better.  But
 full often doth she give thanks to the Saviour of the World with
 her whole heart, and prayeth Him of His pleasure grant her son
 length of life for the amendment both of soul and body.  Perceval
 was with his mother of a long space, and with his sister, and was
 much feared and honoured of all the knights of the land, alike
 for his great wisdom and great pains-taking, as well as for the
 valour of his knighthood.
