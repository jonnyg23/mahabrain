 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXIV</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Here the story is silent of the kingdom, and of King Arthur and
 Messire Gawain that remain in the castle to maintain and guard it
 until they shall have garnished it of folk.  Here speaketh it
 word of the knight's son of the Waste Manor, there whither the
 brachet led Messire Gawain where he found the knight that
 Lancelot had slain.  He had one son whose name was Meliant, and
 he had not forgotten his father's death; rather, thereof did
 wrath rankle in his heart.  He heard tell that Briant of the
 Isles had great force and great puissance, and that he warred
 upon King Arthur's land, insomuch as that he had already slain
 many of his knights.  Thitherward goeth he, and is come to where
 Briant was in a castle of his own.  He telleth him how Lancelot
 had slain his father in such sort, and prayeth him right
 courteously that he would make him knight, for that right fain
 would he avenge his father, and therefore would he help him in
 the war the best he might.  Briant made much joy thereof, and
 made him knight in right costly sort, and he was the comeliest
 knight and the most valiant of his age in Briant's court, and
 greatly did he desire to meet with Lancelot.  They marvelled much
 in the land and kingdom what had become of him.  The more part
 thought that he was dead, albeit dead he was not, but rather
 sound and hale and whole, had it not been for the death of Queen
 Guenievre, whereof the sorrow so lay at his heart that he might
 not forget it.  He rode one day amidst a forest, and overtook a
 knight and a damsel that made great joy together, singing and
 making disport.
 </p><p>
 "By God," saith the damsel, "If this knight that cometh here will
 remain, he shall have right good lodging.  It is already nigh
 eventide, and never will he find hostel so good to-day."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel." saith Lancelot, "Of good hostel have I sore need, for I
 am more than enough weary."
 </p><p>
 "So be all they," saith she, "that come from the land of the rich
 King Fisherman, for none may suffer the pain and travail and he
 be not good knight."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "Ah, damsel," saith Lancelot, "Which is the way to the castle
 whereof you speak?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "You will go by this cross that you see
 before you, and we will go by that other way, to a certain hold.
 Haply we shall find you at the castle or ever you depart thence."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot goeth his way and leaveth them.
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the damsel to the knight, "This that goeth
 there is Lancelot.  He knoweth me not, albeit I know him well,
 and I hear that he is sore troubled of his sorrow and mis-ease.
 Natheless, please God, I will have vengeance of him or ever he
 departeth from the castle whither he goeth to harbour.  He made
 marry perforce a knight that loved me better than aught beside,
 and to a damsel that he loved not a whit.  And so much might he
 still better perceive when he saw that she ate not at his table,
 but was seated along with the squires, and that none did aught
 for her at the castle.  But the knight will not abandon her for
 his own honour, and for that I should be blamed thereof."
 </p><p>
 The evening draweth on and Lancelot goeth toward the castle, that
 was right uneath to find and in an unfrequented part.  He espieth
 it at the head of the forest, and seeth that it is large and
 strong, with strong barbicans embattelled, and at the entrance of
 the gateway were fifteen heads of knights hanging.  He found
 without a knight that came from the forest, and asked him what
 castle it was, and he made answer that it was called the Castle
 of the Griffon.
 </p><p>
 "And why are these heads hanging at this door?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "The daughter of the lord of the castle is the
 fairest in the world and that is known in any kingdom, and needs
 must she be offered to wife to all knights that harbour within.
 He that can draw a sword that is fixed in a column in the midst
 of the hall, and fetch it forth, he shall have her of right
 without forfeit."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 "All these have made assay whose heads you see hanging at the
 door, but never might none of them remove the sword, and on this
 occasion were they beheaded.  Now is it said that none may draw
 it forth, unless he that draweth be better knight than another,
 and needs must he be one of them that have been at the Graal.
 But, and you be minded to believe me, fair Sir," saith the
 knight, "You will go elsewhither, for ill lodging is it in a
 place where one must needs set body and life in adventure of
 death, and none ought to be blamed for escaping from his own
 harm.  Sir, the castle is right fell, for it hath underground, at
 the issue of a cavern that is there, a lion and a griffon that
 have devoured more than half a hundred knights."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "It is evening, nor know I how I may go
 farther this day, for I know not whither I go sith that I know
 not the places nor the ways of the forest."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "I speak only for your own good, and God
 grant you depart hence, honour safe."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot findeth the door of the castle all open, and entereth in
 all armed, and alighteth before the master-hall.  The King was
 leaning at the windows, and biddeth stall his horse.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot is entered into the hall, and findeth knights and
 damsels at the tables and playing at the chess, but none did he
 find to salute him nor make him cheer of his coming save the lord
 only, for such was the custom of the castle.  The lord bade him
 be disarmed.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Right well may you allow me wear my arms, for
 they be the fairest garniture and the richest I have."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the lord of the castle, "No knight eateth armed
 within yonder, but he that cometh armed in hither disarmeth
 himself by my leave.  He may take his arms again without gainsay,
 so neither I nor other desire to do him a hurt."
 </p><p>
 With that two squires disarm him.  The lord of the Castle maketh
 bring a right rich robe wherein to apparel him.  The tables were
 set and the meats served.  The damsel issued forth of her chamber
 and was accompanied of two knights as far as the hall.  She
 looketh at Lancelot, and seeth that he is a right comely knight,
 and much liketh her of his bearing and countenance, and she
 thinketh to herself that sore pity would it be so comely knight
 should have his head smitten off.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot saluted the damsel and made great cheer, and when they
 had eaten in hall, forthwith behold you, the damsel where she
 cometh that Lancelot overtook in the forest with the knight.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she to the lord of the castle, "You have harboured
 this night your deadly enemy that slew your brother at the Waste
 Manor."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith the lord of the manor, "I think not so, for
 him would I not have harboured, nor will I not believe it for
 true until such time as I have proved it. Sir," saith he to
 Lancelot, "Make the demand that the others make!"
 </p><p>
 "What is it?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "See there my daughter!  Ask her of me, and if you be such as you
 ought to be, I will give her to you."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "No knight is there in the world so good
 but ought to plume him upon having her to wife, so always she
 were willing, and, so I thought that you would be willing to give
 her to me, I would willingly ask you."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot spake otherwise than as he thought, for the departing of
 the Queen and the sorrow thereof lay so at his heart that never
 again might he lean upon any love in the world, neither of dame
 nor damsel.  He asked his daughter of the knight of the castle,
 and came before him to save the custom so that he might not have
 blame thereof.  And he showed him the sword that is in the
 column, all inlaid with gold.
 </p><p>
 "Go," saith he, "and fulfil the custom, as other knights have
 done."
 </p><p>
 "What is it?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "They might not draw forth the sword from this column, and so
 failed of my daughter and of their lives."
 </p><p>
 "Lord God," saith Lancelot, "Defend me from this custom!"
 </p><p>
 And he cometh toward the column as fast as he may, and seizeth
 the sword with both hands.  So soon as he touched it, the sword
 draweth it forth with such a wrench that the column quaked
 thereof.  The damsel was right joyful thereat, albeit she
 misdoubted the fellness and cruelty of her father, for never yet
 had she seen knight that pleased her so much to love as he.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the other damsel, "I tell you plainly, this is
 Lancelot, the outrageous, that slew your brother.  Natheless, is
 it no lie that he is one of the best knights of the world, albeit
 by the stoutness of his knighthood and his valour many an outrage
 hath he done, and more shall he yet do and he escape you, and, so
 you will believe me, you will never allow him to depart thus;
 sith that and you kill him or slay him you will save the life of
 many a knight."
 </p><p>
 The daughter of the lord of the castle is sore displeased of the
 damsel for this that she saith, and looketh at Lancelot from time
 to time and sigheth, but more durst she not do.  Much marvelleth
 she, sith that Lancelot hath drawn the sword forth of the column,
 that he asketh her not of her father as his own liege woman, but
 he was thinking of another thing, and never was he so sorrowful
 of any lady as he was for the Queen.  But whatsoever thought or
 desire he may have therein, he telleth the lord of the castle
 that he holdeth him to his covenant made at such time as the
 sword was still fixed in the column.
 </p><p>
 "I have a right not to hold thereto," saith the lord of the
 castle, "Nor shall I break not my vow and I fail you herein; for
 no man is bound to give his daughter to his mortal enemy.  Sith
 that you have slain my brother, you are my mortal enemy, and were
 I to give her to you, she ought not to wish it, and were she to
 grant you her love she would be a fool and a madwoman."
 </p><p>
 Right sorrowful is the damsel or this that she heareth her father
 say.  She would fain that Lancelot and she were in the forest,
 right in the depth thereof.  But Lancelot had no mind to be as
 she was thinking.  The lord of the castle made guard the gateway
 of the castle well, in such sort that Lancelot might issue
 therefrom on no side.  Afterward he bade his knights privily that
 they take heed on their lives that they be all ready on the
 morrow and all garnished of their arms, for that it was his
 purpose to smite off Lancelot's head and hang it above all the
 others.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 The daughter of the lord knew these tidings and was right
 sorrowful thereof, for she thinketh never more to have joy at
 heart and he shall be slain in such manner.  She sendeth him
 greeting by her own privy messenger, as she that loveth him
 better than aught else living in the world, and so biddeth and
 prayeth him be garnished of his arms, and ready to protect his
 life, for that her father is fain to smite off his head.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the messenger, "Your force would avail you nought as
 against my lord, for to-morrow there will be a dozen knights all
 armed at the issue of the gate whereby you entered to-night, and
 he saith that he purposeth to cut off your head there where he
 cut the heads off the other knights.  Without the gate there will
 likewise be another dozen knights all armed.  No knight is there
 in the world so good as that he might issue forth of this castle
 through the midst of these four and twenty knights, but my lady
 sendeth you word that there is a cavern under this castle that
 goeth therefrom underground as far as the forest, so that a
 knight may well pass thereby all armed, but there is therein a
 lion, the fiercest and most horrible in the world, and two
 serpents that are called griffons, that have the face of a man
 and the beaks of birds and eyes of an owl and teeth of a dog and
 ears of an ass and feet of a lion and tail of a serpent, and they
 have couched them therewithin, but never saw no man beasts so
 fell and felonous.  Wherefore the damsel biddeth you go by that
 way, by everything that you have ever loved, and that you fail
 her not, for she would fain speak with you at the issue of the
 cavern in an orchard that is nigh a right broad river not far
 from this castle, and will make your destrier be brought after
 you underground."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "And she had not conjured me in
 such sort, and were it not for love of herself, I would have
 rather set myself in hazard with the knights than with the wild
 beasts, for far father would I have delivered myself from them,
 and so I might, than go forth in such-wise."
 </p><p>
 "She sendeth you word," saith the messenger, "that so you do not
 thus, no further trouble will she take concerning you.  She doth
 it of dread lest she lose your love; and here behold a brachet
 that she sendeth you by me that you will carry with you into the
 cavern.  So soon as you shalt see the serpent griffons that have
 couched them therein, you shall show them this and cast her down
 before them.  The griffons love her as much as one beast may love
 another, and shall have such joy and such desire to play with the
 brachet that they will leave you alone, and have such good will
 toward you that they will not look at you after to do you any
 hurt.  But no man is there in the world, no matter how well
 soever he were armed, nor how puissant soever he were in himself,
 might never pass them otherwise, but he should be devoured of
 them.  But no safeguard may you have as against the lion but of
 God only and your own hardiment."
 </p><p>
 "Tell my damsel," saith Lancelot, "that all her commandment will
 I do, but this cowardize resembleth none other, that I shall go
 fight with beasts and leave to do battle with knights."
 </p><p>
 This was then repeated to the damsel, that marvelled her much
 thereat, and said that he was the hardiest knight in the world.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot armed him toward daybreak, and had his sword girt, his
 shield at his neck, and his spear in his hand.  So he entered
 into the cavern, all shamefast, and the brachet followeth after,
 that he deigned not to carry, and so cometh he to the place where
 the griffons were.  So soon as they heard him coming they dress
 them on their feet, and then writhe along as serpents, then cast
 forth such fire, and so bright a flame amidst the rock, as that
 all the cavern is lighted up thereof, and they see by the
 brightness of light of their jaws the brachet coming.  So soon as
 they have espied her, they carry her in their claws and make her
 the greatest cheer in the world.  Lancelot passeth beyond without
 gainsay, and espieth, toward the issue of the cavern, the lion
 that was come from the forest all famished.  He cometh thither
 right hardily, sword drawn.  The lion cometh toward him, jaws
 yawning, and claws bared, thinking to fix them in his habergeon,
 but Lancelot preventeth him and smiteth him so stoutly that he
 cutteth off thigh and leg together.  When the lion feeleth
 himself thus maimed, he seizeth him by the teeth and the claws of
 his fore feet and rendeth away half the skirt of his habergeon.
 Thereupon Lancelot waxeth wroth.  He casteth his shield to the
 ground and approacheth the lion closer.  He seeth that he openeth
 his jaws wide to avenge himself, and thrusteth his sword the
 straightest he may into his gullet, and the lion giveth out a
 roar and falleth dead.  The damsel, that had come into the
 cavern, heareth that the lion is dead.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot issued forth and so cometh into the orchard beside the
 forest, and wiped his sword on the freshness of the green grass.
 Thereupon behold you the damsel that cometh.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she to Lancelot, "Are you wounded in any place?"
 </p><p>
 "Damsel, nowhere, thank God!"
 </p><p>
 Another damsel leadeth a horse into the orchard.  The damsel of
 the castle looketh at Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "Meseemeth that you are not over
 joyous."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "If I be not, I have good right, for I have
 lost the thing in the world that most I loved."
 </p><p>
 "And you have won me," saith she, "so you remain not here, that
 am the fairest damsel in this kingdom, and I have saved you your
 life for this, that you grant me your love, for mine own would I
 fain give unto you."
 </p><p>
 "Gramercy, damsel," saith Lancelot, "Your love and your good
 will fain would I have; but neither you nor none other damsel
 ought not to have affiance in me, and I might so soon set
 carelessly aside the love to whom my heart owed its obedience,
 for the worthiness and the courtesy that were lodged in her.  Nor
 never hereafter, so long as I live, shall I love none other in
 like manner; wherefore all others commend I to God, and to
 yourself, as for leave-taking to one at whose service I fain
 would be; I say that if you shall have need of me, and so I be in
 place and free, I will do all I may to protect your honour."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God!" saith the damsel, "How am I betrayed, sith that I am
 parted from the best knight in the world!  Lancelot, you have
 done that which never yet no knight might do!  Now am I grieved
 that you should escape on such wise, and that your life hath been
 saved in this manner by me.  Better should I love you mine own
 dead, than another's living.  Now would I fain that you had had
 your head smitten off, and that it were hanging with the others!
 So would I solace myself by beholding it!"
 </p><p>
 Lancelot took no account of that he heard, for the grief that lay
 at his heart of the Queen.  He mounteth on his horse and issueth
 forth of the orchard by a postern gate, and entereth into the
 forest, and commendeth him to God.  The lord of the Castle of the
 Griffons marvelleth much that Lancelot delayeth so long.  He
 thinketh that he durst not come down, and saith to his knights,
 "Let us go up and cut off his head, sith that he durst not come
 down."
 </p><p>
 He maketh search for him all through the hall and the chambers,
 but findeth him not.
 </p><p>
 "He hath gone," saith he, "through the cavern, so have the
 griffons devoured him."
 </p><p>
 So he sendeth the twain most hardy of his knights to see.  But
 the brachet had returned after the damsel, whereof the griffons
 were wroth, and they forthwith seized on the two knights that
 entered into their cavern and slew them and devoured.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 When the lord of the castle knew it, he went into the chamber
 where his daughter was, and found her weeping, and thinketh that
 it is for the two knights that are dead.  News is brought him
 that the lion is dead at the issue of the cavern, and thereby
 well knoweth he that Lancelot is gone.  He biddeth his knights
 follow after him, but none was there so hardy as that he durst
 follow.  The damsel was right fain they should go after him, if
 only they might bring him back to the castle, for so mortally was
 she taken of his love that she thought of none other thing.  But
 Lancelot had her not in remembrance, but only another, and rode
 on sadly right amidst the forest, and looked from time to time at
 the rent the lion had made in his habergeon.  He rideth until he
 is come toward evening to a great valley where was forest on the
 one side and the other, and the valley stretched onward half a
 score great leagues Welsh.  He looketh to the right, and on the
 top of the mountain beside the valley he seeth a chapel newly
 builded that was right fair and rich, and it was covered of lead,
 and had at the back two quoins that seemed to be of gold.  By the
 side of this chapel were three houses dight right richly, each
 standing by itself facing the chapel.  There was a right fair
 grave-yard round about the chapel, that was enclosed at the
 compass of the forest, and a spring came down, full clear, from
 the heights of the forest before the chapel and ran into the
 valley with a great rushing; and each of the houses had its own
 orchard, and the orchard an enclosure.  Lancelot heareth vespers
 being chanted in the chapel, and seeth the path that turned
 thitherward, but the mountain is so rugged that he could not go
 along it on horseback.  So he alighteth and leadeth his horse
 after him by the reins until he cometh nigh the chapel.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 There were three hermits therewithin that had sung their vespers,
 and came over against Lancelot.  They bowed their heads to him
 and he saluted them, and then asked of them what place was this?
 And they told him that the place there was Avalon.  They make
 stable his horse.  He left his arms without the chapel and
 entereth therein, and saith that never hath he seen none so fair
 nor so rich.  There were within three other places, right fair
 and seemly dight of rich cloths of silk and rich corners and
 fringes of gold.  He seeth the images and the crucifixes all
 newly fashioned, and the chapel illumined of rich colours; and
 moreover in the midst thereof were two coffins, one against the
 other, and at the four corners four tall wax tapers burning, that
 were right rich, in four right rich candlesticks.  The coffins
 were covered with two pails, and there were clerks that chanted
 psalms in turn on the one side and the other.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot to one of the hermits, "For whom were these
 coffins made?"
 </p><p>
 "For King Arthur and Queen Guenievre."
 </p><p>
 "King Arthur is not yet dead," saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "No, in truth, please God!  but the body of the Queen lieth in
 the coffin before us and in the other is the head of her son,
 until such time as the King shall be ended, unto whom God grant
 long life!  But the Queen bade at her death that his body should
 be set beside her own when he shall end.  Hereof have we the
 letters and her seal in this chapel, and this place made she be
 builded new on this wise or ever she died."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 When Lancelot heareth that it is the Queen that lieth in the
 coffin, he is so straitened in his heart and in his speech that
 never a word may he say.  But no semblant of grief durst he make
 other than such as might not be perceived, and right great
 comfort to him was it that there was an image of Our Lady at the
 head of the coffin.  He knelt down the nighest he might to the
 coffin, as it had been to worship the image, and set his race and
 his mouth to the stone of the coffin, and sorroweth for her right
 sweetly.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Lady," saith he, "But that I dread the blame of the people,
 never again would I seek to depart from this place, but here
 would I save my soul and pray for yours; so would it be much
 recomforting to me that I should be so nigh, and should see the
 sepulchre wherein your body lieth that had so great sweetness and
 bounty.  God grant me of your pleasure, that at my death I may
 still be a-nigh, and that I may die in such manner and in such
 place as that I may be shrouded and buried in this holy chapel
 where this body lieth."
 </p><p>
 The night cometh on.  A clerk cometh to the hermits and saith,
 "Never yet did no knight cry mercy of God so sweetly, nor of His
 sweet Mother, as did this knight that is in the chapel."
 </p><p>
 And the hermits make answer that knights for the most part do
 well believe in God.  They come to the chapel for him and bid him
 come thence, for that meat is ready and he should come to eat,
 and after that go to sleep and rest, for it is full time so to
 do.  He telleth them that as for his eating this day it is stark
 nought, for a desire and a will hath taken him to keep vigil in
 the chapel before one of the images of Our Lady.  No wish had he
 once to depart thence before the day, and he would fain that the
 night should last far longer than it did.  The good men durst not
 force him against his will; they say, rather, that the worshipful
 man is of good life who will keep watch in such manner throughout
 the night without drink or meat, for all that he seemeth to be
 right weary.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIII.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot was in the chapel until the morrow before the tomb.  The
 hermits apparelled them to do the service that they chanted each
 day, mass for the soul of the Queen and her son.  Lancelot
 heareth them with right good will.  When the masses were sung, he
 taketh leave of the hermits and looketh at the coffin right
 tenderly.  He commendeth the body that lieth therein to God and
 His sweet Mother; then findeth he without the chapel his horse
 accoutred ready, and mounteth forthwith, and departeth, and
 looketh at the place and the chapel so long as he may see them.
 He hath ridden so far that he is come nigh Cardoil, and findeth
 the land wasted and desolate, and the towns burnt, whereof is he
 sore grieved.  He meeteth a knight that came from that part, and
 he was wounded full sore.  Lancelot asketh him whence he cometh,
 and he saith, "Sir, from towards Cardoil.  Kay the Seneschal,
 with two other knights, is leading away Messire Ywain li Aoutres
 toward the castle of the Hard Rock.  I thought to help to rescue
 him, but they have wounded me in such sort as you see."
 </p><p>
 "Are they ever so far away?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, they will pass just now at the head of this forest; and so
 you are fain to go thither, I will return with you right
 willingly and help you to the best I may."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot smiteth his horse with the spurs forthwith, and the
 knight after him, and espieth Kay the Seneschal, that was
 bringing Messire Ywain along at a great pace, and had set him
 upon a trotting hackney, for so he thought that none would know
 him.  Lancelot overtaketh him and crieth, "By my head, Kay the
 Seneschal, shame had you enough of that you did to King Arthur
 when you slew his son, and as much more ought you now to have of
 thus warring upon him again!"
 </p><p>
 He smiteth his horse of his spurs, lance in rest, and Kay the
 Seneschal turneth toward him, and they mell together with their
 spears on their shields, and pierce them in such sort that an
 ells-length of each shaft passeth through beyond.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIV.
 </p><p>
 The lances were strong so as that they brast not.  They draw them
 back to themselves so stoutly and come together so fiercely that
 their horses stagger and they lose the stirrups.  Lancelot
 catcheth Kay the Seneschal at the passing beyond, in the midst of
 the breast, and thrusteth his spear into him so far that the
 point remained in the flesh, and Kay to-brast his own; and sore
 grieved was he when he felt himself wounded.  The knight that was
 wounded overthrew one of the two knights.  Kay is on the ground,
 and Lancelot taketh his horse and setteth Messire Ywain li
 Aoutres thereupon, that was right sore wounded so as that he
 scarce might bear it.  Kay the Seneschal maketh his knight
 remount, and holdeth his sword grasped in his fist as though he
 had been stark wood.  Lancelot seeth the two knights sore badly
 wounded, and thinketh that and he stay longer they may remain on
 the field.  He maketh them go before him, and Kay the Seneschal
 followeth them behind, himself the third knight, that is right
 wroth of the wound he feeleth and the blood that he seeth.
 Lancelot bringeth off his knights like as the wild-boar goeth
 among the dogs, and Kay dealeth him great buffets of his sword
 when he may catch him, and Lancelot him again, and so they
 depart, fencing in such sort.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XV.
 </p><p>
 When Kay the Seneschal seeth that he may not harm him, he turneth
 him back, full of great wrath, and his heart pricketh to avenge
 him thereof and he may get at him, for he is the knight of the
 court that most he hateth.  He is come back to the Castle of the
 Hard Rock.  Briant of the Isles asketh him who hath wounded him
 in such sort, and he telleth him that he was bringing thither
 Ywain li Aoutres when Lancelot rescued him.
 </p><p>
 "And the King," saith Briant, "Is he repaired thither?"
 </p><p>
 "I have heard no tidings of him at all," saith Kay, "For no
 leisure had I to ask of any."
 </p><p>
 Briant and his knights take much thought as concerning Lancelot's
 coming, for they are well persuaded that Lancelot hath come for
 that the King is dead and Messire Gawain, whereof they make right
 great joy.  Kay the Seneschal maketh him be disarmed and his
 wound searched.  They tell him he need not fear it shall be his
 death, but that he is right sore wounded.
 </p><p>

 Lancelot is entered into the castle of Cardoil, and his wounded
 knights withal, and findeth the folk in sore dismay.  Great dole
 make they in many places and much lamentation for King Arthur,
 and say that now nevermore may they look for succeur to none, and
 he be dead and Messire Gawain.  But they give Lancelot joy of
 that he hath rescued Messire Ywain li Aoutres, and were so
 somewhat comforted and made great cheer.  The tidings thereof
 came to the knights that were in the castle, and they all come
 forward to meet him save they that were wounded, and so led him
 up to the castle, and Messire Ywain with him and the other knight
 that was wounded.  All the knights of the castle were right glad,
 and ask him tidings of King Arthur, and whether he were dead or
 no.  And Lancelot telleth them that he was departed from him at
 the Palace Meadow, where he won the white destrier and the crown
 of gold there where the tidings were brought to him that Queen
 Guinievre was dead.

 "Then you tell us of a truth that the King is on live, and
 Messire Gawain?"
 </p><p>
 "Both, you may be certain!" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon were they gladder than before.  They told him of their
 own mischance, how Briant of the Isles had put them to the worse,
 and how Kay the Seneschal was with him to do them hurt.  For he
 it is that taketh most pains to do them evil.
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "Kay the Seneschal ought of right
 to take heed and with-hold him from doing you ill, but he
 departed from the field with the point of my spear in him when I
 rescued Messire Ywain."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 The knights are much comforted of the coming of Lancelot, but he
 is much grieved that he findeth so many of them wounded.  Meliant
 of the Waste Manor is at the castle of the Hard Rock, and good
 fellow is it betwixt him and Kay the Seneschal.  He is right glad
 of the tidings he hath heard, that Lancelot is come, and saith
 that he is the knight of the world that most he hateth, and that
 he will avenge him of his father and he may meet him.  There come
 before the castle of Cardoil one day threescore knights armed,
 and they seize upon their booty betwixt the castle and the
 forest.  Lancelot issueth forth all armed, and seven of the best
 of the castle with him.  He cometh upon them after that they have
 led away their plunder.  He overtaketh one knight and smiteth him
 with his spear right through the body, and the other knights make
 an onset upon the others and many to-brake their spears, and much
 clashing was there of steel on armour; and there fell at the
 assembly on one side and the other full a score knights, whereof
 some were wounded right sore.  Meliant of the Waste Manor espied
 Lancelot, and right great joy made he of seeing him, and smiteth
 him so stout a buffet on the shield that he to-breaketh his
 spear.
 </p><p>

 Lancelot smiteth him amidst the breast so grimly that he maketh
 him bend backwards over the saddle behind, and so beareth him to
 the ground, legs uppermost, over his horse's croup, and trampleth
 him under his horse's feet.  Lancelot was minded to alight to the
 ground to take him, but Briant of the Isles cometh and maketh him
 mount again perforce.  The numbers grew on the one side and the
 other of knights that came from Cardoil and from the Hard Rock.
 Right great was the frushing of lances and the clashing of swords
 and the overthrow of horses and knights.  Briant of the Isles and
 Lancelot come against each other so stoutly that they pierce
 their shields and cleave their habergeons, and they thrust with
 their spears so that the flesh is broken under the ribs and the
 shafts are all-to-splintered.  They hurtle against each other so
 grimly at the by-passing that their eyes sparkle as it were of
 stars in their heads, and the horses stagger under them.  They
 hold their swords drawn, and so return the one toward the other
 like lions.  Such buffets deal they upon their helms that they
 beat them in and make the fire leap out by the force of the
 smiting of iron by steel. And Meliant cometh all armed toward
 Lancelot to aid Briant of the Isles, but Lucan the Butler cometh
 to meet him, and smiteth him with his spear so stoutly that he
 thrusteth it right through his shield and twisteth his arm gainst
 his side.  He breaketh his spear at the by-passing, and Meliant
 also breaketh his, but he was wounded passing sore.
 </p><p>

 Thereupon he seizeth him by the bridle and thinketh to lead him
 away, but the knights and the force of Briant rescue him.  The
 clashing of arms lasted great space betwixt Briant of the Isles
 and Lancelot, and each was mightily wrath for that each was
 wounded.  Either seized other many times by the bridle, and each
 was right fain to lead the other to his own hold, but the force
 of knights on the one side and the other disparted them asunder.
 Thus the stour lasted until evening, until that the night
 sundered them.  But Briant had nought to boast of at departing,
 for Lancelot and his men carried off four of his by force right
 sore wounded, besides them that remained dead on the field.
 Briant of the Isles and Meliant betook them back all sorrowful
 for their knights that are taken and dead.  Lancelot cometh back
 to Cardoil, and they of the castle make him right great joy of
 the knights that they bring taken, and say that the coming of the
 good knight Lancelot should be great comfort to them until such
 time as King Arthur should repair back and Messire Gawain.  The
 wounded knights that were in the castle turned to healing of
 their wounds, whereof was Lancelot right glad.  They were as many
 as five and thirty within the castle.  Of all the King's knights
 were there no more save Lancelot and the wounded knight that he
 brought along with him.
