 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XVIII</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Here the story is silent of Lancelot and Messire Gawain, and
 saith that Perceval is in the Turning Castle, whereof Joseus
 recounteth the truth, to wit, that Virgil founded it in the air
 by his wisdom in such fashion, when the philosophers went on the
 Quest of the Earthly Paradise, and it was prophesied that the
 castle should not cease turning until such time as the Knight
 should come thither that should have a head of gold, the look of
 a lion, a heart of steel, the navel of a virgin maiden,
 conditions without wickedness, the valour of a man and faith and
 belief of God; and that this knight should bear the shield of the
 Good Soldier that took down the Saviour of the World from hanging
 on the rood.  It was prophesied, moreover, that all they of the
 castle and all other castles whereof this one was the guardian
 should hold the old law until such time as the Good Knight should
 come, by whom their souls should be saved and their death
 respited.  For, so soon as he should be come, they should run to
 be baptized, and should firmly believe the new law.  Wherefore
 was the joy great in the castle for that their death should now
 be respited, and that they should be released of all terror of
 the knight that was their foe, whom they dreaded even to the
 death, and of the sin of the false law whereof they had
 heretofore been attaint.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 Right glad is Perceval when he seeth the people of the castle
 turn them to the holy faith of the Saviour, and the damsel saith
 to him, "Sir, right well have you speeded thus far on your way;
 nought is there now to be done save to finish that which
 remaineth.  For never may they that are within issue forth so
 long as the Knight of the Dragon is on live.  Here may you not
 tarry, for the longer you tarry, the more lands will be desolate
 and the more folk will he slay.  Perceval taketh leave of them of
 the castle, that make much joy of him, but sore misgiving have
 they of him on account of the knight with whom he goeth to do
 battle, and they say that if he shall conquer him, never yet
 befell knight so fair adventure.  They have heard mass before
 that he departeth, and made rich offerings for him in honour of
 the Saviour and His sweet Mother.  The damsel goeth before, for
 that she knew the place where the evil knight had his repair.
 They ride until they come into the Island of Elephants.  The
 Knight was alighted under an olive tree, and had but now since
 slain four knights that were of the castle of the Queen of the
 Golden Circlet.  She was at the windows of her castle and saw her
 Knights dead, whereof made she great dole.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God," saith she, "Shall I never see none that may avenge me
 of this evildoer that slayeth my men and destroyeth my land on
 this wise?"
 </p><p>
 She looketh up and seeth Perceval come and the damsel.
 </p><p>
 "Sir Knight, and you have not force and help and valour in you
 more than is in four knights, come not nigh this devil!  Howbeit,
 and you feel that you may so do battle as to overcome and
 vanquish him, I will give you the Golden Circlet that is within,
 and will hold with the New Law that hath been of late
 established.  For I see well by your shield that you are a
 Christian, and, so you may conquer him, then ought I at last to
 be assured that your law availeth more than doth ours, and that
 God was born of the Virgin."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 Right joyous is Perceval of this that he heareth her say.  He
 crosseth and blesseth him, and commendeth him to God and His
 sweet Mother; and is pricked of wrath and hardiment like a lion.
 He seeth the Knight of the Dragon mounted, and looketh at him in
 wonderment, for that he was so big that never had he seen any man
 so big of his body.  He seeth the shield at his neck, that was
 right black and huge and hideous.  He seeth the Dragon's head in
 the midst thereof, that casteth out fire and flame in great
 plenty, so foul and hideous and horrible that all the field stank
 thereof.  The damsel draweth her toward the castle and leaveth
 the knight on the horsesaith.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she to Perceval, "On this level plot was slain your
 uncle's son whom here I leave, for I have brought him far enough.
 Now avenge him as best you may, I render and give him over to
 you, for so much have I done herein as that none have right to
 blame me."
 </p><p>
 With that she departeth.  The Knight of the Dragon removeth and
 seeth Perceval coming all alone, wherefore hath he great scorn of
 him and deigneth not to take his spear, but rather cometh at him
 with his drawn sword, that was right long and red as a burning
 brand.  Perceval seeth him coming and goeth against him, spear in
 rest, as hard as his horse may carry him, thinking to smite him
 through the breast.  But the Knight setteth his shield between,
 and the flame that issued from the Dragon burnt the shaft thereof
 even to his hand.  And the Knight smiteth him on the top of his
 helmet, but Perceval covereth him of his shield, whereof had he
 great affiance that the sword of the foeman knight might not harm
 it.  Josephus witnesseth us that Joseph of Abarimacie had made be
 sealed in the boss of the shield some of the blood of Our Lord
 and a piece of His garment.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 When the Knight seeth that he hath not hurt Perceval's shield,
 great marvel hath he thereof, for never aforetime had he smitten
 knight but he had dealt him his death-blow.  He turneth the head
 of the Dragon towards Perceval's shield, but the flame that
 issued from the Dragon's head turned back again as it had been
 blown of the wind, so that it might not come nigh him.  The
 Knight is right wroth thereof, and passeth beyond and cometh to
 the bier of the dead knight and turneth his shield with the
 dragon's head against him.  He scorcheth and burneth all to ashes
 the bodies of the knight and the horses.
 </p><p>
 Saith he to Perceval, "Are you quit as for this knight's burial?"
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith Perceval, "You say true, and much misliketh me
 thereof, but please God I shall amend it."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 The damsel that had brought the knight was at the windows of the
 palace beside the Queen.  She crieth out. "Perceval, fair sir,"
 saith the damsel,"Now is the shame the greater and the harm the
 greater, and you amend them not."
 </p><p>
 Right sorrowful is Perceval of his cousin that is all burnt to a
 cinder, and he seeth the Knight that beareth the devil with him,
 but knoweth not how he may do vengeance upon him.  He cometh to
 him sword-drawn, and dealeth him a great blow on the shield in
 such sort that he cleaveth it right to the midst thereof where
 the dragon's head was, and the flame leapeth forth so burning hot
 on his sword that it waxed red-hot like as was the Knight's
 sword.
 </p><p>
 And the damsel crieth to him: "Now is your sword of the like
 power as his; now shall it be seen what you will do!  I have been
 told of a truth that the Knight may not be vanquished save by one
 only and at one blow, but how this is I may not tell, whereof
 irketh me."
 </p><p>
 Perceval looketh and seeth that his sword is all in a flame of
 fire, whereof much he marvelleth.  He smiteth the Knight so
 passing sore that he maketh his head stoop down over the fore
 saddle-bow.  The Knight righteth him again, sore wrath that he
 may not put him to the worse.  He smiteth him with his sword a
 blow so heavy that he cleaveth the habergeon and his right
 shoulder so that he cutteth and burneth the flesh to the bone. 
 As he draweth back his blow, Perceval catcheth him and striketh
 him with such passing strength that he smiteth off his hand,
 sword and all.  The Knight gave a great roar, and the Queen was
 right joyous thereof.  The Knight natheless made no semblant that
 he was yet conquered, but turneth back toward Perceval at a right
 great gallop and launched his flame against his shield, but it
 availeth him nought, for he might not harm it.  Perceval seeth
 the dragon's head, that was broad and long and horrible, and
 aimeth with his sword and thrusteth it up to the hilt into his
 gullet as straight as ever he may, and the head of the dragon
 hurleth forth a cry so huge that forest and fell resound thereof
 as far as two leagues Welsh.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 The dragon's head turneth it toward his lord in great wrath, and
 scorcheth him and burneth him to dust, and thereafter departed up
 into the sky like lightning.  The Queen cometh to Perceval, and
 all the knights, and see that he is sore hurt in his right
 shoulder.  And the damsel telleth him that never will he be
 healed thereof save he setteth thereon of the dust of the knight
 that is dead.  And they lead him up to the castle with right
 great joy.  Then they make him be disarmed, and have his wound
 washed and tended and some of the knight's dust that was dead set
 thereon that it might have healing.  She maketh send to all the
 knights of her land: "Lords," saith she, "See here the knight
 that hath saved my land for me and protected your lives.  You
 know well how it hath been prophesied that the knight with head
 of gold should come, and through him should you be saved.  And
 now, behold, hath he come hither.  The prophecy may not be
 belied.  I will that you do his commandment."
 </p><p>
 And they said that so would they do right willingly.  She
 bringeth him there where the Circlet of Gold is, and she herself
 setteth it on his head.  After that, she bringeth his sword and
 delivereth it unto him, wherewith he had slain the giant devil,
 both the knight that bare the devil, and the devil that the
 knight bare in his shield.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "May all they that will not go to be baptized,
 nor accept your New Law, be slain of this your sword, and hereof
 I make you the gift."
 </p><p>
 She herself made her be held up and baptized first, and all the
 other after.  Josephus maketh record that in right baptism she
 had for name Elysa, and a good life she led and right holy, and
 she died a virgin.  Her body still lieth in the kingdom of
 Ireland, where she is highly honoured.  Perceval was within the
 castle until that he was heal.  The tidings spread throughout the
 lands that the Knight of the Golden Circlet had slain the Knight
 of the Dragon, and great everywhere was the joy thereof.  It was
 known at the court of King Arthur, but much marvelled they that
 it was said the Knight of the Golden Circlet had slain him, for
 they knew not who was the Knight of the Golden Circlet.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 When Perceval was whole, he departed from the castle of the Queen
 of the Golden Circlet, all of whose land was at his commandment.
 The Queen told him that she would keep the Golden Circlet until
 he should will otherwise, and in such sort he left it there, for
 he would not carry it with him, sith that he knew not whitherward
 he might turn.  The history telleth us that he rode on until one
 day he came to the Castle of Copper.  Within the castle were a
 number of folk that worshipped the bull of copper and believed
 not in any other God.  The bull of copper was in the midst of the
 castle upon four columns of copper, and bellowed so loud at all
 hours of the day that it was heard for a league all round about,
 and there was an evil spirit within that gave answers concerning
 whatsoever any should ask of it.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 At the entrance to the gateway of the castle were two men made of
 copper by art of nicromancy, and they held two great mallets of
 iron, and they busied themselves striking the one after the
 other, and so strongly they struck that nought mortal is there in
 the world that might pass through amongst their blows but should
 be all to-crushed thereby.  And on the other side was the castle
 so fast enclosed about that nought might enter thereinto.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 Perceval beholdeth the fortress of the castle, and the entrance
 that was so perilous, whereof he marvelleth much.  He passeth a
 bridge that was within the entry, and cometh nigh them that guard
 the gate.  A Voice began to cry aloud above the gate that he
 might go forward safely, and that he need have no care for the
 men of copper that guarded the gate nor be affrighted of their
 blows, for no power had they to harm such a knight as was he.  He
 comforteth himself much of that the Voice saith to him.  He
 cometh anigh the serjeants of copper, and they cease to strike at
 once, and hold their iron mallets quite still.  And he entereth
 into the castle, where he findeth within great plenty of folk
 that all were misbelievers and of feeble belief.  He seeth the
 bull of copper in the midst of the castle right big and horrible,
 that was surrounded on all sides by folk that all did worship
 thereunto together round about.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII.
 </p><p>
 The bull bellowed so passing loud that right uneath was it to
 hear aught else within the castle besides.  Perceval was
 therewithin, but none was there that spake unto him, for, so
 intent were they upon adoring the bull that, and any had been
 minded to slay them what time they were yet worshipping the same,
 they would have allowed him so to do, and would have thought that
 they were saved thereby; and save this had they none other
 believe in the world.  It was not of custom within there to be
 armed, for the entrance of the fortress was so strong that none
 might enter but by their will and commandment, save it were the
 pleasure of our Lord God.  And the devil that had deceived them,
 and in whom they believed, gave them such great abundance
 therewithin of everything they could desire, that nought in the
 world was there whereof they lacked.  When he perceived that they
 held no discourse with him, he draweth himself on one side by a
 great hall, and so called them around him.  The more part came
 thither, but some of them came not.  The Voice warneth him that
 he make them all pass through the entrance of the gateway there
 where the men with the iron mallets are, for there may he well
 prove which of them are willing to believe in God and which not.
 The Good Knight draweth his sword and surroundeth them all and
 maketh them all go in common before him, would they or nould
 they.  And they that would not go willingly and kindly might be
 sure that they should receive their death.  He made them pass
 through the entrance there where the serjeants of copper were
 striking great blows with their iron mallets.  Of one thousand
 five hundred that there were, scarce but thirteen were not all
 slain and brained of the iron mallets.  But the thirteen had
 firmly bound their belief in Our Lord, wherefore the serjeants
 took no heed of them.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIII.
 </p><p>
 The evil spirit that was in the bull of copper issued forth
 thereof as it had been lightning from heaven, and the bull of
 copper melted all in a heap so as that nought remained in that
 place thereof.  Then the thirteen that remained sent for a hermit
 of the forest and so made themselves be held up and baptized.
 After that, they took the bodies of the misbelievers and made
 cast them into a water that is called the River of Hell.  This
 water runneth into the sea, so say many that have seen it, and
 there where it spendeth itself in the sea is it most foul and
 most horrible, so that scarce may ship pass that is not wrecked.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIV.
 </p><p>
 Josephus maketh record that the hermit that baptized the thirteen
 had the name of Denis, and that the castle was named the Castle
 of the Trial.  They lived within there until the New Law was
 assured and believed in throughout all the kingdoms, and a right
 good life led they and a holy.  Nor never might none enter with
 them thereinto but was slain and crushed save he firmly believed
 in God.  When the thirteen that were baptized in the castle
 issued forth thereof they scattered themselves on every side
 among strange forests, and made hermitages and buildings, and put
 their bodies to penance for the false law they had maintained and
 to win the love of the Saviour of the World.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XV.
 </p><p>
 Perceval, as you may hear, was soldier of Our Lord, and well did
 God show him how He loved his knighthood, for the Good Knight had
 much pain and sore travail and pleased Him greatly.  He was come
 one day to the house of King Hermit that much desired to see him,
 and made much joy of him when he saw him, and rejoiced greatly of
 his courage.  Perceval relateth to him all the greater adventures
 that have befallen him at many times and in many places sithence
 that he departed from him, and King Hermit much marvelleth him of
 many.
 </p><p>
 "Uncle," saith Perceval, "I marvel me much of an adventure that
 befell me at the outlet of a forest; for I saw a little white
 beast that I found in the launde of the forest, and twelve hounds
 had she in her belly, that bayed aloud and quested within her. 
 At last they issued forth of her and slew her beside the cross
 that was at the outlet of the forest, but they might not eat of
 her flesh.  A knight and a damsel, whereof one was at one end of
 the launde and the other at the other, came thither and took the
 flesh and the blood, and set them in two vessels of gold.  And
 the hounds that were born of her fled away into the forest."
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," saith the Hermit, "I know well that God loveth you
 sith that such things appear to you, for His valour and yours and
 for the chastity that is in your body.  The beast, that was
 kindly and gentle and sweet, signifieth Our Lord Jesus Christ,
 and the twelve dogs that yelped within her signify the people of
 the Old Law that God created and made in His own likeness, and
 after that He had made and created them He desired to prove how
 much they loved Him.  He sent them forty years into the
 wilderness, where their garments never wasted, and sent them
 manna from heaven that served them whatsoever they would to eat
 and to drink, and they were without evil and without trouble and
 without sickness, and such joy and pleasance had they as they
 would.  And they held one day their council, and the master of
 them said that and God should wax wroth with them and withhold
 this manna, they would have nought to eat, and that it might not
 last always albeit that God sent it in so passing great plenty.
 Wherefore they purposed to set aside great part thereof in store,
 so that if the Lord God should wax wroth they might take of that
 which was stored and so save themselves for a long space.  They
 agreed among themselves and did thereafter as they had purposed
 and determined amongst them.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVI.
 </p><p>
 "God, that seeth and knoweth all things, knew well their thought.
 He withdrew from them the manna from heaven that had come to them
 in such abundance, and which they had bestowed in caverns
 underground, thinking to find there the manna they had set aside,
 but it was changed by the will of God into efts and adders and
 worms and vermin, and when they saw that they had done evil, they
 scattered themselves over strange lands.  Fair, sweet nephew,"
 saith the Hermit, "These twelve hounds that bayed in the beast
 are the Jews that God had fed, and that were born in the Law that
 He established, nor never would they believe on Him, nor love
 Him, but rather crucified Him and tore His Body after the
 shamefullest sort they might, but in no wise might they destroy
 His flesh.  The knight and damsel that set the pieces of flesh in
 vessels of gold signify the divinity of the Father, which would
 not that His flesh should be minished.  The hounds fled to the
 forest and became savage what time they had torn the beast to
 pieces, so in like manner are the Jews that were and ever shall
 be savage, subject to them of the New Law henceforth for ever."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVII.
 </p><p>
 "Fair uncle," saith Perceval, "Good right and reason is it that
 they should have shame and tribulation and evil reward sith that
 they slew and crucified Him that had created and made them and
 deigned to be born as a man in their Law.  But two priests came
 after, whereof the one kissed the cross and worshipped it right
 heartily and made great joy thereof, and the other did violence
 thereunto and bear it with a great rod, and wept right sore and
 made the greatest dole in the world.  With this last was I right
 sore wrath, and willingly would I have run upon him had he not
 been a priest."
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," saith the Hermit, "He that beat it believed in God
 equally as well as he that adored, for that the holy flesh of the
 Saviour of the World was set thereon, that abhorred not the pains
 of death.  One smiled and made great joy for that He redeemed His
 souls from the pains of hell that would otherwise have been
 therein for evermore; and for this made he yet greater joy, that
 he knew He was God and Man everlastingly in His nature, for he
 that hath not this in remembrance shall never believe aright. 
 Fair nephew, the other priest bear the cross and wept for the
 passing great anguish and torment and dolour that our Lord God
 suffered thereon, for so sore was the anguish as might have
 melted the rock, nor no tongue of man may tell the sorrow He felt
 upon the cross.  And therefore did he bear it and revile it for
 that He was crucified thereon, even as I might hate a spear or
 sword wherewith you had been slain.  For nought else did he thus,
 and ever, so often as he remembereth the pain that God suffered
 thereon, cometh he to the cross in such manner as you saw.  Both
 twain are hermits and dwell in the forest, and he is named Jonas
 that kissed and adored the cross, and he that beat and reviled it
 is named Alexis."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVIII.
 </p><p>
 Willingly heareth Perceval this that his uncle telleth and
 recordeth him.  He relateth how he did battle with the devil-
 knight that bare in his shield the head of a dragon that cast
 forth fire and flame, and how the dragon burnt up his lord at the
 last.
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," saith the hermit, "Right glad am I of these
 tidings that you tell me, for I have been borne on hand that the
 Knight of the Golden Circlet had slain him."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Perceval, "It may well be, but never at any time saw
 I knight so big and horrible."
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," saith the Hermit, "None might overcome him save
 the Good Knight only, for all true worshipful men behoveth do
 battle with the Devil, nor never may he be worshipful man that
 fighteth not against him.  And even as the devil withal that was
 figured on his shield slew and burnt up his master, even so doth
 one devil torment and molest other in the world to come; and
 greater evil might not the Knight of the Devil do you than burn
 the body oœ your uncle's son that he had killed, as I have heard
 tell.  Power had he over his body, but, please God, not over his
 soul to burn it."
 </p><p>
 "Fair uncle," saith Perceval, "I went thither by a Turning
 Castle, where were archers of copper that shot bolts, and bears
 and lions chained at the entrance of the gateway.  So soon as I
 drew nigh and smote thereon with my sword the castle stopped
 still."
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," said King Hermit, "Nought had the Devil outwardly
 besides this castle.  It was the entrance to his fortress, nor
 would they within ever have been converted save you had been
 there."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Right sorrowful am I of Messire Gawain and
 Lancelot, for well I loved their fellowship, and great aid would
 they have been in my need."
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew, had they been chaste as are you, well might they
 have entered on account of their good knighthood.  For were they
 not wanton, the two best knights in the world are they.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIX.
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew, in the time of your knighthood have you much
 advanced the Law of the Saviour, for you have destroyed the
 falsest believe in the world, and this was of them that believed
 on the bull of copper and the devil that was therein.  If this
 folk had remained, and had failed of you, never would it have
 been destroyed until the end of the world.  Wherefore marvel not
 that you have travail in serving God, but endure it willingly,
 for never had worshipful man honour without pains.  But now
 behoveth you achieve another matter.  All they of the land of
 King Fisherman your uncle have abandoned the New Law, and
 returned to that which God hath forbidden.  But the most part do
 so rather perforce and for fear of the King that hath seized the
 land, who is my brother and your uncle, than on account of aught
 else.  Wherefore behoveth you set counsel therein, for this thing
 may not be achieved by any earthly man save by you only.  For the
 castle and land should be yours of right, and sore mischief is it
 when one that cometh of lineage so high and so holy is traitor to
 God, and disloyal to the world.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XX.
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," saith the good man, "The castle hath been much
 strengthened, for there are now nine bridges newly made, and at
 each bridge are there three knights tall and strong and hardy,
 whereof hath he much defence, and your uncle is there within that
 keepeth the castle.  But never sithence, none of the knights of
 King Fisherman nor of his priests have there appeared, nor
 knoweth any what hath befallen them.  The chapel wherein the most
 Holy Graal appeared is all emptied of its sacred hallows; the
 hermits that are by the forest are fain of your coming, for never
 see they there a knight pass by that believeth in God.  And so
 you shall have achieved this enterprise, it is a thing whereof
 shall God be well pleased."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXI.
 </p><p>
 "Fair uncle," saith Perceval, "Thither will I go, sith that you
 commend it to me, for no reason is it that he should have the
 castle that hath entered thereinto.  Of better right ought my
 mother to have it, that was the next-born to King Fisherman, of
 whose death am I right sorrowful."
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew, you are right!  for on your account fell he into
 languishment, and, had you then gone again, so say many, then
 would he have been whole, but how this might have been I know not
 of a certainty.  But methinketh our Lord God willed his
 languishment and death, for had it been His will, you would have
 made the demand, but He willed otherwise, wherefore ought we to
 give thanks and praise Him whatsoever He doth, for He hath
 foreseen of every man that which shall come to him.  I have
 within here a white mule that is very old.  Fair nephew, you will
 take her with you.  She will follow you right willingly, and a
 banner shall you bear, for the power of God and His virtue shall
 avail more than your own.  Seven-and-twenty knights guard the
 nine bridges, all chosen and of approved great valour, and none
 ought now to believe that a single knight may vanquish so many,
 save the miracle of Our Lord and His virtue shall open a way for
 him.  So I pray and beseech you that you have God always in
 remembrance and His sweet Mother, and, so at any time you be put
 to the worse of your knighthood, mount upon the mule and take the
 banner, and your enemies shall forthwith lose their force, for
 nought confoundeth any enemy so swiftly as doth the virtue and
 puissance of God.  It is a thing well known that you are the Best
 Knight of the World, but set not affiance in your strength nor in
 your knighthood as against so many knights, for against them may
 you not endure."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXII.
 </p><p>
 Perceval hearkeneth unto his uncle's discourse and his
 chastening, and layeth fast hold on all that he saith, wherewith
 is he pleased full well, for great affiance hath he in his words.
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew," saith the Hermit, "Two lions are there at the
 entry of the gateway, whereof the one is red and the other white.
 Put your trust in the white, for he is on God's side, and look at
 him whensoever your force shall fail you, and he will look at you
 likewise in such sort as that straightway you shall know his
 intent, by the will and pleasure of Our Saviour.  Wherefore do
 according as you shall see that he would, for no intent will he
 have save good only, and to help you; nor may you not otherwise
 succeed in winning past the nine bridges that are warded of the
 twenty-seven knights.  And God grant you may win past in such
 wise that you may save your body and set forward withal the Law
 of Our Lord that your uncle hath hindered all that he might."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIII.
 </p><p>
 Perceval departeth from the hermitage, and carrieth away the
 banner, according to his uncle's counsel, and the white mule
 followeth after.  He goeth his way toward the land that was the
 land of King Fisherman, and findeth a hermit that was issued
 forth of his hermitage and was going at a great pace through the
 forest.  He abideth so soon as he beholdeth the cross on
 Perceval's shield.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "I well perceive that you are a Christian, of
 whom not a single one have I seen this long time past.  For the
 King of Castle Mortal is driving us forth of this forest, for he
 hath renounced God and His sweet Mother, so that we durst not
 remain in His defence."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Perceval, "But you shall!  for God shall
 lead you forward, and I after.  Are there more hermits in this
 forest?" saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir, there be twelve here that are waiting for me at a
 cross yonder before us, and we are minded to go to the kingdom of
 Logres and put our bodies to penance for God's sake, and to
 abandon our cells and chapels in this forest for dread of this
 felon King that hath seized the land, for he willeth that none
 who believeth in God should here abide."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIV.
 </p><p>
 Perceval is come with the hermit to the cross where the good men
 had assembled them together, and findeth Joseus, the young man
 that was King Pelles' son, of whom he maketh right great joy, and
 he maketh the hermits turn back again with him, saying that he
 will defend them and make them sate, by God's help, in the
 kingdom, and prayeth them right sweetly that they make prayer for
 him to our Lord that He grant him to win back that which of right
 is his own.  He is come forth of the forest and the hermits with
 him.  He draweth nigh to the castle of King Fisherman, and strong
 was the defence at the entrance thereof.  Some of the knights
 well knew that Perceval would conquer him, for long since had it
 been prophesied that he who bare such shield should win the Graal
 of him that sold God for money.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXV.
 </p><p>
 The knights saw Perceval coming and the company of hermits with
 him right seemly to behold, and much marvel had they thereof.
 About a couple of bowshots above the bridge was a chapel
 fashioned like the one at Camelot, wherein was a sepulchre, and
 none knew who lay therein.  Perceval abideth thereby and his
 company.  He leaneth his shield and spear against the chapel, and
 maketh fast his horse and mule by the reins.  He beholdeth the
 sepulchre, that was fight fair, and forthwith the sepulchre
 openeth and the joinings fall apart and the stone lifteth up in
 such wise that a man might see the knight that lay within, of
 whom came forth a smell of so sweet savour that it seemed to the
 good men that were looking on that it had been all embalmed. 
 They found a letter which testified that this knight was named
 Josephus.  So soon as the hermits beheld the sepulchre open, they
 said to Perceval: "Sir, now at last know we well that you are the
 Good Knight, the chaste, the holy."
 </p><p>
 The knights that warded the bridge heard the tidings that the
 sepulchre had opened at the coming of the knight, whereof were
 they in the greater dismay, and well understood that it was he
 that was first at the Graal.  The tidings came to the King that
 held the castle, and he bade his knights not be dismayed for
 dread of a single knight, for that he would have no force nor
 power against them, nor might it never befall but that one only
 of his own knights should be enough to conquer him.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVI.
 </p><p>
 Perceval was armed upon his horse.  The hermits make the sign of
 the cross over him, and bless him and commend him to God.  And he
 holdeth his spear in rest and cometh toward the three knights
 that guard the first bridge.  They all set upon him at once and
 break their spears upon his shield.  One of them he smiteth with
 such force that he maketh him topple over into the river that
 runneth under the bridge, both him and his horse.  Of him was he
 quit, for the river was wide and deep and swift.  The others held
 out against him a much longer bout with sharp sword-play, but he
 vanquished them and smote them to pieces, and flung their bodies
 into the water.  They of the second bridge came forward, that
 were right good knights, and many a tough bout had he of them and
 many a felon onslaught.  Joseus that was his uncle's son was
 there, and said to the other hermits that right fainly would he
 go help him, but that he deemed it might be sin, and they bade
 him take no heed of that, for that great work of mercy would it
 be to destroy the enemies of Our Lord.  He doeth off his grey
 cape and fettleth him in his frock, and taketh one of them that
 were doing battle with Perceval and trusseth him on his neck and
 so flingeth him into the river all armed, and Perceval slayeth
 the other twain and hurleth them into the river in like manner as
 the other.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVII.
 </p><p>
 By the time he had won the two bridges he was full spent and
 weary, wherefore he bethinketh him of the lion, the manner
 whereof his uncle had told him.  Then looketh he toward the
 entrance of the gateway and seeth the white lion, that stood
 upright on his two hinder feet, for that he was fain to see him.
 Perceval looketh him full between the two eyes, and understandeth
 that the lion is minded by the will of God to do him to wit that
 the knights of the third bridge are so hardy and of such strength
 that they may not be overcome of a single knight and our Lord God
 of his holy bounty open not the way, but that he must fain take
 the mule and carry the banner if he would conquer them.  Perceval
 understandeth the white lion's intent, and giveth God thanks
 thereof and draweth him back, and Joseus the young man likewise.
 As soon as they look back, they see that the first bridge is
 already lifted up behind them.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVIII.
 </p><p>
 Perceval cometh to where the white mule was, and she was starred
 on the forehead with a red cross.  He mounteth thereupon, and
 taketh the banner and holdeth his sword drawn.  So soon as the
 white lion seeth him coming, he unchaineth himself and runneth
 incontinent to the bridge that was lifted, right amidst the
 knights, and lowereth it forthwith.  The King of Castle Mortal
 was on the battlements of the greater fortress of the castle, and
 crieth to the knights that warded the bridge, "Lords," saith he,
 "You are the most chosen knights of my land and the hardiest, but
 no hardiment is it to lift the bridges on account of a single
 knight whom you durst not abide body to body, whereof meseemeth
 it great cowardize and not hardiment.  But the lion is hardier
 than you all, that of his hardiment hath lowered the bridge.
 Wherefore now know I well that had I set him to ward the first
 bridge, he would have warded it better than these that have
 allowed themselves to be slain."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIX.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you Perceval come upon his white mule, sword
 drawn all naked in his fist, and cometh toward them of the third
 bridge, whereof he smiteth the first so sore that he overthroweth
 him into the water.  Joseus the hermit cometh forward and would
 fain have seized the other twain, but they cry mercy of Perceval,
 and say that they will be at his will in all things, and so will
 believe on God and His sweet Mother and abandon their evil lord.
 And they of the fourth bridge say likewise.  On such condition he
 alloweth them to live by the counsel of Joseus, and they cast
 away their arms and yield up the bridges at his will.  Perceval
 thinketh within himself that God's virtue hath right great power,
 but that knight who hath force and power ought well to approve
 his prowess for God's sake.  For of all that he shall do or
 suffer for Him, shall God be well pleased.  For, were all the
 world against our Lord God, and He should grant to any single one
 that should be His champion all His power and might, he would
 conquer them all in one hour of the day.  But He willeth that a
 man should travail for Him, even as He Himself suffered travail
 for His people.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXX.
 </p><p>
 Perceval cometh again back and alighteth of the white mule and
 delivereth the banner to Joseus, and then mounteth again on his
 destrier and cometh back to them of the fifth bridge, and these
 defend themselves right stoutly, for that hardy knights are they,
 and do battle against Perceval full sturdily.  Joseus the hermit
 cometh thither and assaulteth them with passing great lustihood,
 that had the Lord God not saved him they would have overthrown
 and slain him.  Howbeit, he holdeth the banner and grappleth them
 when he may lay hold, and grippeth them so straight that they may
 not help themselves.  Perceval slayeth them and crusheth them and
 maketh them topple over into the water that ran swiftly beneath
 the bridge.  When they of the sixth bridge saw that these were
 conquered, they cried mercy of Perceval and yielded themselves to
 him and delivered up their swords to him, and they of the seventh
 bridge likewise.  When the red lion saw that the seventh bridge
 was Won, and that the knights of the two bridges had yielded
 themselves up to Perceval, he leapt up with such fury that he
 burst his chain as had he been wood mad.  He came to one of the
 knights and bit him and slew him, whereof the white lion was full
 wroth, and runneth upon the other lion and teareth him to pieces
 with his claws and teeth.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXI.
 </p><p>
 Straightway thereafter he raiseth himself up on his two hinder
 feet and looketh at Perceval, and Perceval at him.  Perceval
 understandeth well the lion's intent, to wit, that they of the
 last bridge are worse to conquer than the others, and that they
 may not be conquered at all save by the will of God and by him
 that is the lion.  And the lion warned him that he go not against
 them with the banner, holy though it were, nor receive them into
 mercy what surety soever they might make, for that they are
 traitors, but that he must fain mount upon the white mule, for
 that she is a beast on God's side, and that Joseus should bring
 the banner and all the hermits go before, that are worshipful men
 and of good life, so as to dismay the traitor King, and so shall
 the end and the conquest of the castle be brought nigh.  Of all
 this the lion made signs to Perceval, for speak he could not.
 Great affiance hath Perceval in the lion's warning.  He alighteth
 of his destrier and remounteth on the mule, and Joseus holdeth
 the banner.  The company of twelve hermits was there, right
 seemly and holy.  They draw nigh the castle.  The knights on the
 last bridge see Perceval coming towards them and Joseus the
 hermit holding the banner, by whom they had seen their other
 fellows wrestled withal and put to the worse.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXII.
 </p><p>
 The virtue of Our Lord and the dignity of the banner and the
 goodness of the white mule and the holiness of the good hermits
 that made their orisons to Our Lord so struck the knights that
 they lost all power over themselves, but treason might not go
 forth of their hearts, wherefore right heavy were they of their
 kinsmen that they had seen slain before them.  They bethought
 them that and if by mercy they might escape thence, they would
 never end until they had slain Perceval.  They come to meet him
 and so cry him mercy passing sweetly in semblance, and say that
 they will do his will for ever and ever, so only he will let them
 depart safe and sound.  Perceval looketh at the lion to know what
 he shall do; he seeth that the lion thinketh them traitors and
 disloyal, and that so they were destroyed and dead the King that
 was in the castle would have lost his force; and that, so
 Perceval will run upon them, the lion will help him slay them.
 Perceval telleth the knights that never will he have mercy upon
 them, and forthwith runneth upon them, sword drawn, and sorely it
 misliked him that they defended not themselves, insomuch that he
 all but left to slay them for that no defence found he in them.
 But the lion is so far from holding them in the like disdain,
 that he runneth upon them and biteth and slayeth them, and then
 casteth forth their limbs and bodies into the water.  Perceval
 alloweth that this is well and seemly, and pleaseth him much of
 that he seeth the lion do, nor never before had he seen any beast
 that he might love and prize so highly as this one.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXIII.
 </p><p>
 The King of Castle Mortal was on the battlements of the wall, and
 seeth how his knights are dead, and how the lion helpeth to slay
 the last.  He setteth himself on the highest place of the walls,
 then lifteth the skirt of his habergeon and holdeth his sword all
 naked, that was right keen and well-tempered, and so smiteth
 himself right through the body, and falleth all adown the walls
 into the water, that was swift and deep, in such sort that
 Perceval saw him, and all the good hermits likewise, that
 marvelled much of a King that should slay himself in such manner;
 but they say according to the judgment of the scripture, that by
 right of evil man should the end be evil.  On such wise was the
 end of this King of whom I tell you.  Josephus relateth us how
 none ought to marvel that of three brothers, even though they be
 sons of the same father and mother, one brother should be evil;
 and the real marvel, saith he, is when one evil corrupteth not
 the two that are good, for that wickedness is so hard and keen
 and beguiling, and goodness so kindly and simple and humble. 
 Cain and Abel were brothers-german, yet Cain slew his brother
 Abel, the one flesh betrayed the other.  But great sorrow is it,
 saith Josephus, when the flesh that ought to be one becometh
 twain, and the one flesh goeth about by wickedness to deceive and
 destroy the other.  Josephus recordeth us by this evil king that
 was so traitorous and false and yet was of the lineage of the
 Good Soldier Joseph of Abarimacie.  This Joseph, as the scripture
 witnesseth, was his uncle, and this evil king was brother-german
 of King Fisherman, and brother of the good King Pelles that had
 abandoned his land, in order that he might serve God, and brother
 of the Widow Lady that was Perceval's mother, the most loyal that
 was ever in Great Britain.  All these lineages were in the
 service of Our Lord from the beginning of their lives unto the
 end, save only this evil King that perished so evilly as you have
 heard.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXIV.
 </p><p>
 You have heard how the King that had seized the castle that had
 been King Fisherman's slew himself in such wise, and how his
 knights were discomfited.  Perceval entered into the castle and
 the worshipful hermits together with him.  It seemed them when
 they were come within into the master hall, that they heard chant
 in an inner chapel `Gloria in excelsis Deo', and right sweet
 praising of Our Lord.  They found the hails right rich and seemly
 and fairly adorned within.  They found the chapel open where the
 sacred hallows were wont to be.  The holy hermits entered therein
 and made their orisons, and prayed the Saviour of the World that
 He would swiftly restore to them the most Holy Graal and the
 sacred hallows that wont to be therewithin whereby they might be
 comforted.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXV.
 </p><p>
 The good men were there within with Perceval, that much loved
 their company.  Josephus witnesseth us that the ancient knights
 that were of the household of King Fisherman, and the priests and
 damsels, departed so soon as the King that slew himself had
 seized the castle, for that they would not be at his court, and
 the Lord God preserved them from him and made them go into such a
 place as that they should be in safety.  The Saviour of the World
 well knew that the Good Knight had won the castle by his valour
 that should have been his own of right, and sent back thither all
 them that had served King Fisherman.  Perceval made right great
 joy of them when he saw them, and they of him.  They seemed well
 to be a folk that had come from some place where God and His
 commandments were honoured, and so indeed had they.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXVI.
 </p><p>
 The High History witnesseth us that when the conquest of the
 castle was over, the Saviour of the World was right joyous and
 well pleased thereof.  The Graal presented itself again in the
 chapel, and the lance whereof the point bleedeth, and the sword
 wherewith St John was beheaded that Messire Gawain won, and the
 other holy relics whereof was right great plenty.  For our Lord
 God loved the place much.  The hermits went back to their
 hermitages in the forest and served Our Lord as they had been
 wont.  Joseus remained with Perceval at the castle as long as it
 pleased him, but the Good Knight searched out the land there
 where the New Law had been abandoned and its maintenance
 neglected.  He reft the lives of them that would not maintain it
 and believe.  The country was supported by him and made safe, and
 the Law of Our Lord exalted by his strength and valour.  The
 priests and knights that repaired to the castle loved Perceval
 much, for, so far from his goodness minishing in ought, they saw
 from day to day how his valour and his faith in God increased and
 multiplied.  And he showed them the sepulchre of his uncle King
 Fisherman in the chapel before the altar.  The coffin was rich
 and the tabernacle costly and loaded of precious stones.  And the
 priests and knights bear witness that as soon as the body was
 placed in the coffin and they were departed thence, they found on
 their return that it was covered by the tabernacle all dight as
 richly as it is now to be seen, nor might they know who had set
 it there save only the commandment of Our Lord.  And they say
 that every night was there a great brightness of light as of
 candles there, and they knew not whence it should come save of
 God.  Perceval had won the castle by the command of God.  The
 Graal was restored in the holy chapel, and the other hallows as
 you have heard.  The evil believe was done away from the kingdom,
 and all were assured again in the New Law by the valour of the
 Good Knight.
