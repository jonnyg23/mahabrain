 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXIII</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Of Perceval the story is here silent, and saith that King Arthur
 and Messire Gawain have taken leave of Perceval and all them of
 the castle.  The King leaveth him the good destrier that he won,
 with the golden crown.  They have ridden, he and Messire Gawain
 together, until they are come to a waste ancient castle that
 stood in a forest.  The castle would have been right fair and
 rich had any folk wonned therein, but none there were save one
 old priest and his clerk that lived within by their own toil. 
 The King and Messire Gawain lodged there the night, and on the
 morrow went into a right rich chapel that was therein to hear
 mass, and it was painted all around of right rich colours of gold
 and azure and other colours.  The images were right fair that
 were there painted, and the Figures of them for whom the images
 were made.  The King and Messire Gawain looked at them gladly.
 When the mass was said, the priest cometh to them and saith:
 "Lords," saith he, "These imagings are right fair, and he that
 had them made is full loyal, and dearly loved the lady and her
 son for whom he had them made.  Sir," saith the priest, "It is a
 true history."
 </p><p>
 "Of whom is the history, fair Sir?" saith King Arthur.
 </p><p>
 "Of a worshipful vavasour that owned this hold, and of Messire
 Gawain, King Arthur's nephew, and his mother. Sir," saith the
 priest, "Messire Gawain was born there within and held up and
 baptized, as you may see here imaged, and he was named Gawain for
 the sake of the lord of this castle that had that name.  His
 mother, that had him by King Lot, would not that it should be
 known.  She set him in a right fair coffer, and prayed the good
 man of this castle that he would carry him away and leave him
 where he might perish, but and if he would not do so, she would
 make another do it.  This Gawain, that was loyal and would not
 that the child should be put to death, made seal letters at the
 pillow-bere of his cradle that he was of lineage royal on the one
 side and the other, and set therein gold and silver so as that
 the child might be nurtured in great plenty, and spread above the
 child a right rich coverlid.  He carried him away to a far
 distant country, and so came one early morning to a little
 homestead where dwelt a right worshipful man.  He delivered the
 child to him and his wife, and bade them they should keep him and
 nurture him well, and told them that it might be much good should
 come to them thereof.  The vavasour turned him back, and they
 took charge of the child and nurtured him until that he were
 grown, and then took him to Rome to the Holy Father, and showed
 him the sealed letters.  The Holy Father saw them and understood
 that he was the son of a King.  He had pity upon him, and gave
 him to understand that he was of his kindred.  After that, he was
 elected to be Emperor of Rome.  But he would not be Emperor lest
 he should be reproached of his birth that had before been
 concealed from him.  He departed thence, and lived afterwards
 within yonder.  Now is it said that he is one of the best knights
 in the world, insomuch that none durst take possession of this
 castle for dread of him, nor of this great forest that lieth
 round about it.  For, when the vavasour that dwelt here was dead,
 he left to Messire Gawain, his foster-son, this castle, and made
 me guardian thereof until such time as Messire Gawain should
 return."

 II.
 </p><p>
 The King looketh at Messire Gawain, and seeth him stoop his head
 toward the ground for shame.
 </p><p>
 "Fair nephew, be not ashamed, for as well might you reproach me
 of the same.  Of your birth hath there been great joy, and dearly
 ought one to love the place and honour it, where so good a knight
 as are you was born."
 </p><p>
 When the priest understood that it was Messire Gawain, he made
 great cheer to him, and was all ashamed of that he had recorded
 as concerning his birth.  But he saith to him: "Sir, small blame
 ought you to have herein, for you were confirmed in the law that
 God hath established and in loyalty of marriage of King Lot and
 your mother.  This thing King Arthur well knoweth, and our Lord
 God be praised for that, you have come hither!"
