 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Introduction</h1>
 <p>
 This book is translated from the first volume of "Perceval le
 Gallois ou le conte du Graal"; edited by M. Ch. Potvin for `La
 Societe des Bibliophiles Belges' in 1866, (1) from the MS.
 numbered 11,145 in the library of the Dukes of Burgundy at
 Brussels.  This MS. I find thus described in M. F. J. Marchal's
 catalogue of that priceless collection: `"Le Roman de Saint
 Graal", beginning "Ores lestoires", in the French language; date,
 first third of the sixteenth century; with ornamental capitals.'
 (2)  Written three centuries later than the original romance, and
 full as it is of faults of the scribe, this manuscript is by far
 the most complete known copy of the "Book of the Graal" in
 existence, being defective only in Branch XXI. Titles 8 and 9,
 the substance of which is fortunately preserved elsewhere.  Large
 fragments, however, amounting in all to nearly one-seventh of the
 whole, of a copy in handwriting of the thirteenth century, are
 preserved in six consecutive leaves and one detached leaf bound
 up with a number of other works in a MS. numbered 113 in the City
 Library at Berne.  The volume is in folio on vellum closely
 written in three columns to the page, and the seven leaves follow
 the last poem contained in it, entitled "Duremart le Gallois".
 The manuscript is well known, having been lent to M. de Sainte
 Palaye for use in the Monuments of French History issued by the
 Benedictines of the Congregation of St Maur.  Selections from the
 poems it contains are given in Sinner's "Extraits de Poesie du
 XIII. Siecle", (3) and it is described, unfortunately without any
 reference to these particular leaves, by the same learned
 librarian in the "Catalogus Codicum MSS. Bibl. Bernensis", J.R.
 Sinner. (4)
 </p><p>
 M. Potvin has carefully collated for his edition all that is
 preserved of the Romance in this manuscript, comprising all the
 beginning of the work as far as Branch III. Title 8, about the
 middle, and from Branch XIX. Title 23, near the beginning, to
 Branch XXX. Title 5, in the middle.  Making allowance for
 variations of spelling and sundry minor differences of reading,
 by no means always in favour of the earlier scribe, the Berne
 fragments are identical with the corresponding portions of the
 Brussels manuscript, and it is therefore safe to assume that the
 latter is on the whole an accurate transcript of the entire
 original Romance.
 </p><p>
 The only note of time in the book itself is contained in the
 declaration at the end.  From this it appears that it was written
 by order of the Seingnor of Cambrein for Messire Jehan the
 Seingnor of Neele.  M. Potvin, without giving any reason for so
 doing, assumes that this Lord of Cambrein is none other than the
 Bishop of Cambrai.  If this assumption be correct, the person
 referred to was probably either John of Berhune, who held the see
 from 1200 till July 27, 1219, or his successor Godfrey of
 Fontaines (Conde), who held it till 1237.  To me, however, it
 seems more likely that the personage intended was in reality the
 'Seingnor' of Cambrin, the chef-lieu of a canton of the same
 name, on a small hill overlooking the peat-marshes of Bethune,
 albeit I can find no other record of any such landed proprietor's
 existence.
 </p><p>
 Be this as it may, the Messire Jehan, Seingnor of Neele, can
 hardly be other than the John de Nesle who was present at the
 battle of Bouvines in 1214, and who in 1225 sold the lordship of
 Bruges to Joan of Flanders. (5)  These dates therefore may be
 regarded as defining that of the original Romance within fairly
 narrow limits.
 </p><p>
 This conclusion is confirmed by other evidence.  An early Welsh
 translation of the story was published with an English version
 and a glossary by the Rev. Robert Williams in the first volume of
 his "Selections from the Hengwrt MSS". (6)  The first volume of
 this work is entitled "Y Seint Greal, being the adventures of
 King Arthur's knights of the Round Table, in the quest of the
 Holy Grail, and on other occasions.  Originally written about the
 year 1200".  The volume, following the manuscript now in the
 library of W.W.E. Wynne, Esq., at Peniarth, is divided into two
 parts.  The first, fol. 1-109 of the manuscript, represents the
 thirteenth to the seventeenth book of Sir Thomas Malory's "Morte
 d'Arthur".  Of the second, which represents the Romance here
 translated, Mr Williams writes: "The second portion of the Welsh
 Greal, folios 110-280, contains the adventures of Gwalchmei
 Peredur and Lancelot, and of the knights of the Round Table; but
 these are not found in the "Morte d'Arthur".  The Peniarth MS. is
 beautifully written on vellum, and in perfect preservation, and
 its date is that of Henry VI., the early part of the fifteenth
 century.  The orthography and style of writing agrees literally
 with that of the "Mabinogion of the Llyvr Coch Hergest", which is
 of that date.  This, of course, is a transcript of an earlier
 copy; but there is no certainty when it was first translated into
 Welsh, though Aneurin Owen in his "Catalogue of the Hengwrt MSS."
 assigns it to the sixth year of Henry I.  It is mentioned by
 Davydd ab Gwilym, who died in 1368."
 </p><p>
 Whatever may be the date of the Welsh version, the translator had
 no great mastery of French, and is often at fault as to the
 meaning both of words and sentences, and when in a difficulty is
 only too apt to cut the knot by omitting the passage bodily.  The
 book itself, moreover, is not entire.  On page 275, all between
 Branch IX. Title 16 and Branch XI. Title 2, twenty-two chapters
 in all, is missing.  Again, on page 355, Titles 10-16 in Branch
 XXI. are left out, while the whole of the last Branch, containing
 28 Titles, is crumpled up into one little chapter, from which it
 would seem that the Welshman had read the French, but thought it
 waste of pains to translate it.  In all, not to speak of other
 defects, there are fifty-six whole chapters in the present book,
 of which there is not a word in the Welsh.
 </p><p>
 In one matter, however, Mr Williams' English translation has
 stood me in good stead.  In Branch XXI., as I have said, the
 French manuscript makes default of two Titles, but almost the
 whole of their substance is supplied by the Welsh version.  By an
 unlucky accident, before the hiatus in the French is fully filled
 up, the Welsh version itself becomes defective, though the gap
 thus left open can hardly extend beyond a very few words. 
 Without this supplement, incomplete as it is, it would have been
 impossible to give the full drift of one of the Romancer's best
 stories, which is equally unintelligible in both the French and
 Welsh texts in their present state.
 </p><p>
 As the Welsh version gives a number of names both of persons and
 places widely differing from those in the French, it may be
 useful here to note the principal changes made.  Perceval in the
 Welsh is called Peredur, which is said to mean "steel suit".  The
 Welshman, however, adds that the name in French is "Peneffresvo
 Galief", which, unless it be a misreading or miswriting for
 Perceval le Galois, is to me wholly unintelligible.  Perceval's
 father, Alain li Gros, is in the Welsh Earl Evrawg, and his
 sister Dindrane, Danbrann.  King Arthur is Emperor Arthur, his
 Queen Guenievre, Gwenhwyvar, and their son Lohot, Lohawt or
 Llacheu.  Messire Gawain is Gwalchmei; Chaus, son of Ywain li
 Aoutres, Gawns, son of Owein Vrych; Messire Kay or Kex is Kei the
 Long; Ahuret the Bastard, Anores; Ygerne, wife of Uther
 Pendragon, Eigyr; Queen Jandree, Landyr; and King Fisherman for
 the most part King Peleur.  Of places, Cardoil is Caerlleon on
 Usk, Pannenoisance, Penvoisins; Tintagel, Tindagoyl; and Avalon,
 Avallach.
 </p><p>
 By a double stroke of ill-luck, the complete and wholly
 independent Romance here translated has thus been printed by its
 two former editors as if it were only a part of some other story.
 M. Potvin describes it as the "First Part, the Romance in Prose,"
 of his "Perceval le Gallois", and Mr Williams accepts it as the '
 "Second Portion" of his "Y Seint Greal".  This unhappy
 collocation has led not a few of M. Potvin's readers to neglect
 his First Part, under the impression that the story is retold in
 the other volumes containing the Romance in verse; while not a
 few of Mr Williams' readers have neglected his Second Portion
 under the impression that there could be nothing of any special
 importance in an adjunct referred to by the Editor in so
 perfunctory a manner.  In very truth, however, the Story of the
 Holy Graal here told is not only the most coherent and poetic of
 all the many versions of the Legend, but is also the first and
 most authentic.
 </p><p>
 This seems to be proved beyond doubt by a passage in the History
 of Fulke Fitz-Warine, originally written apparently between the
 years 1256 and 1264.  The passage occurs at the end of the
 History, and is printed in verse of which I give a literal prose
 translation:
 </p><blockquote>
      "Merlin saith that in Britain the Great a Wolf shall come
      from the White Launde.  Twelve sharp teeth shall he have,
      six below and six above.  He shall have so fierce a look
      that he shall chase the Leopard forth of the White Launde,
      so much force shall he have and great virtue.  We now know
      that Merlin said this for Fulke the son of Waryn, for each
      of you ought to understand of a surety how in the time of
      the King Arthur that was called the White Launde which is
      now named the White Town.  For in this country was the
      chapel of S. Austin that was fair, where Kahuz, the son of
      Ywein, dreamed that he carried off the candlestick and that
      he met a man who hurt him with a knife and wounded him in
      the side.  And he, on sleep, cried out so loud that King
      Arthur hath heard him and awakened from sleep.  And when
      Kahuz was awake, he put his hand to his side.  There hath he
      found the knife that had smitten him through.  SO TELLETH US
      THE GRAAL, THE BOOK OF THE HOLY VESSEL.  There the King
      Arthur recovered his bounty and his valour when he had lost
      all his chivalry and his virtue.  From this country issued
      forth the Wolf as saith Merlin the Wise, and the twelve
      sharp teeth have we known by his shield.  He bore a shield
      indented as the heralds have devised.  In the shield are
      twelve teeth of gules and argent.  By the Leopard may be
      known and well understood King John, for he bore in his
      shield the leopards of beaten gold." (7)
 </blockquote>
 
 The story of Kahuz or Chaus here indicated by the historian is
 told at length in the opening chapters of the present work and,
 so far as is known, nowhere else.  The inference is therefore
 unavoidable that we have here "The Graal, the Book of the Holy
 Vessel" to which the biographer of Fulke refers.  The use,
 moreover, of the definite article shows that the writer held this
 book to be conclusive authority on the subject.  By the time he
 retold the story of Fulke, a whole library of Romances about
 Perceval and the Holy Graal had been written, with some of which
 it is hard to believe that any historian of the time was
 unacquainted.  He nevertheless distinguishes this particular
 story as "The Graal", a way of speaking he would scarce have
 adopted had he known of any other "Graals" of equal or nearly
 equal authority.
 <p>
 Several years later, about 1280, the trouveur Sarrazin also cites
 "The Graal" ("li Graaus") in the same manner, in superfluous
 verification of the then-accepted truism that King Arthur was at
 one time Lord of Great Britain.  This appeal to "The Graal" as
 the authority for a general belief shows that it was at that time
 recognised as a well-spring of authentic knowledge; while the
 fact that the trouveur was not confounding "The Graal" with the
 later version of the story is further shown by his going on
 presently to speak of "the Romance that Chrestien telleth so
 fairly of Perceval the adventures of the Graal." (8)
 </p><p>
 Perhaps, however, the most striking testimony to the fact that
 this work is none other than the original "Book of the Graal" is
 to be found in the "Chronicle of Helinand", well known at the
 time the Romance was written not only as a historian but as a
 troubadour at one time in high favour at the court of Philip
 Augustus, and in later years as one of the most ardent preachers
 of the Albigensian Crusade.  The passage, a part of which has
 been often quoted, is inserted in the Chronicle under the year
 720, and runs in English thus:
 </p><blockquote>
      "At this time a certain marvellous vision was revealed by an
      angel to a certain hermit in Britain concerning S. Joseph,
      the decurion who deposed from the cross the Body of Our
      Lord, as well as concerning the paten or dish in the which
      Our Lord supped with His disciples, whereof the history was
      written out by the said hermit and is called "Of the Graal"
      (de Gradali).  Now, a platter, broad and somewhat deep, is
      called in French "gradalis" or "gradale", wherein costly
      meats with their sauce are wont to be set before rich folk
      by degrees ("gradatim") one morsel after another in divers
      orders, and in the vulgar speech it is called "graalz", for
      that it is grateful and acceptable to him that eateth
      therein, as well for that which containeth the victual, for
      that haply it is of silver or other precious material, as
      for the contents thereof, to wit, the manifold courses of
      costly meats.  I have not been able to find this history
      written in Latin, but it is in the possession of certain
      noblemen written in French only, nor, as they say, can it
      easily be found complete.  This, however, I have not
      hitherto been able to obtain from any person so as to read
      it with attention.  As soon as I can do so, I will translate
      into Latin such passages as are more useful and more likely
      to be true." (9)
 </blockquote>
 
 A comparison of this passage with the Introduction to the present
 work (10) leaves no doubt that Helinand here refers to this "Book
 of the Graal", which cannot therefore be of a later date than
 that at which he made this entry in his "Chronicle".  At the same
 time, the difficulty he experienced in obtaining even the loan of
 the volume shows that the work had at that time been only lately
 written, as in the course of a few years, copies of a book so
 widely popular must have been comparatively common.  The date,
 therefore, at which Helinand's "Chronicle" was written determines
 approximately that of the "Book of the Graal".
 <p>
 In its present state, the "Chronicle" comes to an end with a
 notice of the capture of Constantinople by the French in 1204,
 and it has been hastily assumed that Helinand's labours as a
 chronicler must have closed in that year.  As a matter of fact
 they had not then even begun.  At that time Helinand was still a
 courtly troubadour, and had not yet entered on the monastic
 career during which his "Chronicle" was compiled.  He was
 certainly living as late as 1229, and preached a sermon, which
 assuredly shows no signs of mental decrepitude, in that year at a
 synod in Toulouse. (11)
 </p><p>
 Fortunately a passage in the "Speculum Historiale" of Vincent of
 Beauvais, himself a younger contemporary and probably a personal
 acquaintance of Helinand, throws considerable light on the real
 date of Helinand's "Chronicle".  After recounting certain matters
 connected with the early years of the thirteenth century, the
 last date mentioned being 1209, Vincent proceeds: --
 </p><blockquote>
      "In those times, in the diocese of Beauvais, was Helinand
      monk of Froid-mont, a man religious and distinguished for
      his eloquence, who also composed those verses on Death in
      our vulgar tongue which are publicly read, so elegantly and
      so usefully that the subject is laid open clearer than the
      light.  He also diligently digested into a certain huge
      volume a Chronicle from the beginning of the world down to
      his own time.  But in truth this work was dissipated and
      dispersed in such sort that it is nowhere to be found
      entire.  For it is reported that the said Helinand lent
      certain sheets of the said work to one of his familiars, to
      wit, Guarin, Lord Bishop of Senlis of good memory, and thus,
      whether through forgetfulness or negligence or some other
      cause, lost them altogether.  From this work, however, as
      far as I have been able to find it, I have inserted many
      passages in this work of mine own also."
 </blockquote>
 
 It will thus be seen that about 1209, Helinand became a monk at
 Froid-mont, and it is exceedingly improbable that any portion of
 his "Chronicle" was written before that date.  On the other hand,
 his `familiar' Guarin only became Bishop of Senlis in 1214, and
 died in 1227, (12) so that it is certain Helinand wrote the last
 part of his "Chronicle" not later than the last-mentioned year.
 The limits of time, therefore, between which the "Chronicle" was
 written are clearly circumscribed; and if it is impossible to
 define the exact year in which this particular entry was made, it
 is not, I fancy, beyond the legitimate bounds of critical
 conjecture.
 <p>
 On the first page of the Romance, Helinand read that an Angel
 had appeared to a certain hermit in Britain and revealed to him
 the history of the Holy Graal.  In transferring the record of
 this event to his "Chronicle", he was compelled by the exigencies
 of his system, which required the insertion of every event
 recorded under some particular year, to assign a date to the
 occurrence.  A vague "five hundred years ago" would be likely to
 suggest itself as an appropriate time at which the occurrence
 might be supposed to have taken place; and if he were writing in
 1220, the revelation to the hermit would thus naturally be
 relegated to the year 720, the year under which the entry
 actually appears. This, of course, is pure guesswork, but the
 fact remains that the "Chronicle" was written in or about 1220,
 and the "Book of the Graal" not long before it.
 </p><p>
 The name of the author is nowhere recorded.  He may possibly be
 referred to in the "Elucidation" prefixed to the rhymed version
 of "Percival le Gallois" under the name of "Master Blihis", but
 this vague and tantalising pseudonym affords no hint of his real
 identity. (13)  Whoever he may have been; I hope that I am not
 misled by a translator's natural partiality for the author he
 translates in assigning him a foremost rank among the masters of
 medieval prose romance.
 </p><p>
 With these testimonies to its age and genuineness, I commend the
 "Book of the Graal" to all who love to read of King Arthur and
 his knights of the Table Round.  They will find here printed in
 English for the first time what I take to be in all good faith
 the original story of Sir Perceval and the Holy Graal, whole and
 incorrupt as it left the hands of its first author.
