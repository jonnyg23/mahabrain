 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch VIII</h1> 
 Of the most Holy Graal here beginneth another branch in such wise
 as the authority witnesseth and Joseph that made recoverance
 thereof, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
 Holy Ghost.
 <p>
 </p><p>
 TITLE I.
 </p><p>
 This high history and profitable witnesseth us that the son of
 the Widow Lady sojourned still with his uncle King Pelles in the
 hermitage, and through distress of the evil that he had had since
 he came forth of the house of King Fisherman, was he confessed to
 his uncle and told him of what lineage he was, and that his name
 was Perceval.  But the good Hermit the good King had given him
 the name of Parluifet, for that he was made of himself.  King
 Hermit was one day gone into the forest, and the good knight
 Parluifet felt himself sounder of health and lustier than he wont
 to be.  He heard the birds sing in the forest, and his heart
 began to swell of knighthood, and he minded him of the adventures
 he wont to find in the forest and of the damsels and knights that
 he wont to meet, and never was he so fain of arms as was he at
 that time, for that he had been sojourning so long within doors.
 He felt courage in his heart and lustiness in his limbs and
 fainness in his thought.  Right soon armeth he himself and
 setteth the saddle on his horse and mounteth forthwith.  He
 prayeth God give him adventure that he may meet good knight,
 setteth himself forth of his uncle's hermitage and entereth into
 the forest that was broad and shady.  He rideth until he cometh
 into a launde that was right spacious, and seeth a leafy tree
 that was at the head of the launde.  He alighteth in the shadow,
 and thinketh to himself that two knights might joust on this bit
 of ground fair and well, for the place was right broad.  And,
 even as he was thinking on this wise, he heard a horse neigh full
 loud in the forest three times, and right glad was he thereof and
 said: "Ha, God, of your sweetness grant that there be a knight
 with that horse, so may I prove whether there be any force or
 valour or knighthood in me.  For I know not now what strength I
 may have, nor even whether my heart be sound and my limbs whole.
 For on a knight that hath neither hardihood nor valour in
 himself, may not another knight that hath more force in him
 reasonably prove his mettle, for many a time have I heard say
 that one is better than other.  And for this pray I to the
 Saviour and this be a knight that cometh there, that he may have
 strength and hardihood and mettle to defend his body against mine
 own, for great desire have I to run upon him.  Grant now that he
 slay me not, nor I him!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 Therewithal, he looketh before him, and seeth the knight issue
 from the forest and enter into the launde.  The knight was armed
 and had at his neck a white shield with a cross of gold.  He
 carried his lance low, and sate upon a great destrier and rode at
 a swift pace.  As soon as Perceval seeth him, he steadieth him in
 his stirrups and setteth spear in rest and smiteth his horse with
 his spurs, right joyous, and goeth toward the knight a great
 gallop.  Then he crieth: "Sir Knight, cover you of your shield to
 guard you as I do of mine to defend my body, for you do I defy on
 this side slaying, and our Lord God grant that I find you so good
 knight as shall try what hardihood of heart I may have, for I am
 not such as I have been aforetime, and better may one learn of a
 good knight than of a bad."
 </p><p>
 With that he smiteth the knight upon his shield with such a sweep
 that he maketh him lose one of his stirrups and pierceth his
 shield above the boss, and passeth beyond full speed.  And the
 knight marvelleth much, and maketh demand, saying, "Fair Sir,
 what misdeed have I done you?"
 </p><p>
 Perceval is silent, and hath no great joy of this that he hath
 not overthrown the knight, but not so easy was he to overthrow,
 for he was one of the knights of the world that could most of
 defence of arms.  He goeth toward Perceval as fast as his horse
 may carry him and Perceval toward him.  They mell together upon
 their shields right stiffly, so that they pierce and batter them
 with the points of their spears.  And Perceval thrusteth his
 spear into the flesh two finger-breadths, and the knight doth not
 amiss, for he passeth his spear right through his arm so that the
 shafts of the lances were splintered.  They hurtle together
 either against other at the passing so mightily, that the
 flinders of iron from the mail of their habergeons stick into
 their foreheads and faces, and the blood leapeth forth by mouth
 and nose so that their habergeons were all bloody.  They drew
 their swords with a right great sweep.  The knight of the white
 shield holdeth Perceval's rein and saith: "Gladly would I know
 who you are and wherefore you hate me, for you have wounded me
 right sore, and sturdy knight have I found you and of great
 strength."
 </p><p>
 Perceval saith not a word to him and runneth again upon him sword
 drawn, and the knight upon him, and right great buffets either
 giveth other on the helm, so that their eyes all sparkle of stars
 and the forest resoundeth of the clashing of their swords.  Right
 tough was the battle and right horrible, for good knights were
 both twain.  But the blood that ran down from their wounds at
 last slackened their sinews, albeit the passing great wrath that
 the one had against the other, and the passing great heat of
 their will, had so enchafed them they scarce remembered the
 wounds that they had, and still dealt each other great buffets
 without sparing.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 King Hermit cometh from labouring in the forest and findeth not
 his nephew in the hermitage, whereof is he right sorrowful, and
 he mounteth on a white mule that he had therewithin.  She was
 starred in the midst of her forehead with a red cross.  Josephus
 the good clerk witnesseth us that this same mule had belonged to
 Joseph of Abarimacie at the time he was Pilate's soldier, and
 that he bequeathed her to King Pelles.  King Hermit departeth
 from the hermitage and prayeth God grant him to find his nephew.
 He goeth through the forest and rideth until he draweth nigh the
 launde where the two knights were.  He heareth the strokes of the
 swords, and cometh towards them full speed and setteth him
 between the twain to forbid them.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, sir," saith he to the Knight of the White Shield, "Right
 great ill do you to combat against this knight that hath lain
 sick this long time in this forest, and fight sorely have you
 wounded him."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the-knight, "As much hath he done by me, and never
 would I have run upon him now had he not challenged me, and he is
 not minded to tell me who he is nor whence ariseth his hatred of
 me."
 </p><p>
 "Fair Sir," saith the Hermit, "And you, who are you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "I will tell you. I am the son of King
 Ban of Benoic."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, fair nephew," saith King Hermit to Perceval, "See here your
 cousin, for King Ban of Benoic was your father's cousin-german.
 Make him right great cheer!"
 </p><p>
 He maketh them take off their helmets and lower their ventails,
 and then kiss one another, afterward he leadeth them to his
 hermitage.  They alight together.  He calleth his own squire that
 waited upon him, and made them be disarmed right tenderly.  There
 was a damsel within that was cousin-german to King Pelles and had
 tended Perceval within in his sickness.  She washeth their wounds
 right sweetly and cleanseth them of the blood.  And they see that
 Lancelot is sorer wounded than Perceval.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the Hermit, "How seemeth you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Needs must this knight sojourn here, for his
 wound is in a right perilous place."
 </p><p>
 "Hath he danger of death?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "In no wise of this wound, but behoveth him
 take good heed thereto."
 </p><p>
 "God be praised!" saith he, "and of my nephew how seemeth you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, the wound that he hath will be soon healed.  He will have
 none ill thereof."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 The damsel, that was right cunning of leech-craft, tended the
 wounds of the knights, and made them whole as best she might, and
 King Hermit himself gave counsel therein.  But and Perceval had
 borne his shield that was there within, of sinople with a white
 hart, Lancelot would have known him well, nor would there have
 been any quarrel between them, for he had heard tell of this
 shield at the court of King Arthur.  The authority of this story
 recordeth that the two knights are in hermitage, and that
 Perceval is well-nigh whole; but Lancelot hath sore pain of his
 wound and is still far from his healing.
