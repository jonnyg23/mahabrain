 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XXII</h1> 
 INCIPIT.
 <p>
 Of Lancelot the story is here silent, and so beginneth another
 branch of the Graal in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
 and of the Holy Ghost.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 TITLE I.
 </p><p>
 You may well understand that King Arthur is no whit joyful.  He
 maketh the white destrier go after him, and hath the crown of
 gold full near himself.  They ride until they come to the castle
 that belonged to King Fisherman, and they found it as rich and
 fair as you have heard told many a time.  Perceval, that was
 there within, made right great joy of their coming, as did all
 the priests and ancient knights.  Perceval leadeth King Arthur,
 when he was disarmed, into the chapel where the Graal was, and
 Messire Gawain maketh present to Perceval of the Golden Circlet,
 and telleth him that the Queen sendeth it to him, and relateth
 also how Nabigant had seized it, and moreover, how Nabigant was
 dead.  The King offereth the crown that had been Queen
 Guenievre's.  When Perceval knew that she was dead, he was right
 sorrowful thereof in his heart, and wept and lamented her right
 sweetly.  He showeth them the tomb of King Fisherman, and telleth
 them that none had set the tabernacle there above the coffin, but
 only the commandment of Our Lord, and he showeth them a rich pall
 that is upon the coffin, and telleth them that every day they see
 a new one there not less rich than is this one.  King Arthur
 looketh. at the sepulchre and saith that never tofore hath he
 seen none so costly.  A smell issueth therefrom full delicate and
 sweet of savour.  The King sojourneth in the castle and is highly
 honoured, and beholdeth the richesse and the lordship and the
 great abundance that is everywhere in the castle, insomuch that
 therein is nought wanting that is needful for the bodies of noble
 folk.  Perceval had made set the bodies of the dead knights in a
 charnel beside an old chapel in the forest, and the body of his
 uncle that had slain himself so evilly.  Behind the castle was a
 river, as the history testifieth, whereby all good things came to
 the castle, and this river was right fair and plenteous. 
 Josephus witnesseth us that it came from the Earthly Paradise and
 compassed the castle around and ran on through the forest as far
 as the house of a worshipful hermit, and there lost the course
 and had peace in the earth.  All along the valley thereof was
 great plenty of everything continually, and nought was ever
 lacking in the rich castle that Perceval had won.  The castle, so
 saith the history, had three names.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 One of the names was Eden, the second, Castle of Joy, and the
 third, Castle of Souls.  Now Josephus saith that none never
 passed away therein but his soul went to Paradise.  King Arthur
 was one day at the castle windows with Messire Gawain.  The King
 seeth coming before him beyond the bridge a great procession of
 folk one before another; and he that came before was all clad in
 white, and bare a full great cross, and each of the others a
 little one, and the more part came singing with sweet voices and
 bear candles burning, and there was one behind that carried a
 bell with the clapper and all at his neck.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God," saith King Arthur, "What folk be these?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Perceval, "I know them all save the last.  They be
 hermits of this forest, that come to chant within yonder before
 the Holy Graal, three days in the week."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 When the hermits came nigh the castle, the King went to meet
 them, and the knights adore the crosses and bow their heads
 before the good men.  As soon as they were come into the holy
 chapel, they took the bell from the last and smote thereon at the
 altar, and then set it on the ground, and then began they the
 service, most holy and most glorious.  The history witnesseth us
 that in the land of King Arthur at this time was there not a
 single chalice.  The Graal appeared at the sacring of the mass,
 in five several manners that none ought not to tell, for the
 secret things of the sacrament ought none to tell openly but he
 unto whom God hath given it.  King Arthur beheld all the changes,
 the last whereof was the change into a chalice.  And the hermit
 that chanted the mass found a brief under the corporal and
 declared the letters, to wit, that our Lord God would that in
 such vessel should His body be sacrificed, and that it should be
 set upon record.  The history saith not that there were no
 chalices elsewhere, but that in all Great Britain and in the
 whole kingdom was none.  King Arthur was right glad of this that
 he had seen, and had in remembrance the name and the fashion of
 the most holy chalice.  Then he asked the hermit that bare the
 bell, whence this thing came?
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he to Messire Gawain, "I am the King for whom you
 slew the giant, whereby you had the sword wherewith St John was
 beheaded, that I see on this altar.  I made baptize me before you
 and all those of my kingdom, and turn to the New Law, and
 thereafter I went to a hermitage by the sea, far from folk, where
 I have been of a long space.  I rose one night at matins and
 looked under my hermitage and saw that a ship had taken haven
 there.  I went thither when the sea was retreated, and found
 within the ship three priests and their clerks, that told me
 their names and how they were called in baptism.  All three were
 named Gregory, and they came from the Land of Promise, and told
 me that Solomon had cast three bells, one for the Saviour of the
 World, and one for His sweet Mother, and one for the honour of
 His saints, wherefore they had brought this hither by His
 commandment into this kingdom for that we had none here.  They
 told me that and I should bear it into this castle, they would
 take all my sins upon themselves, by Our Lord's pleasure, in such
 sort as that I should be quit thereof.  And I in like manner have
 brought it hither by the commandment of God, who willeth that
 this should be the pattern of all those that shall be fashioned
 in the realm of this island where never aforetime have been
 none."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Messire Gawain to the hermit, "I know you
 right well for a worshipful man, for you held your covenant truly
 with me."
 </p><p>
 King Arthur was right glad of this thing, as were all they that
 were within.  It seemed him that the noise thereof was like the
 noise that he had heard sound ever since he had moved from
 Cardoil.  The hermits went their way each to his hermitage when
 they had done the service.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 One day, as the King sate at meat in the hall with Perceval and
 Messire Gawain and the ancient knights, behold you therewithal
 one of the three Damsels of the Car that cometh, and she was
 smitten all through her right arm.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she to Perceval, "Have mercy on your mother and your
 sister and on us.  Aristor of Moraine, that is cousin to the Lord
 of the Moors that you slew, warreth upon your mother, and hath
 carried off your sister by force into the castle of a vavasour of
 his, and saith that he will take her to wife and will have all
 her land that your mother ought to hold of right, maugre your
 head.  But never had knight custom so cruel as he, for when he
 shall have espoused the damsel, whomsoever she may be, yet will
 he never love her so well but that he shall cut off her head with
 his own hand, and so thereafter go seek for another to slay in
 like manner.  Natheless in one matter hath he good custom, that
 never will he do shame to none until such time as he hath
 espoused her.  Sir, I was with my Lady your sister when he maimed
 me in this manner.  Wherefore your mother sendeth you word and
 prayeth you that you succour her, for you held her in covenant
 that so you would do and she should have need thereof and you
 should know it; for and you consent to her injury and loss, the
 shame will be your own."
 </p><p>
 Perceval heard these tidings, and sore sorrowful was he thereof. 
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the King to Perceval, "I and my nephew, so
 please you, will go to help you."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Gramercy, but go and achieve your own affair
 also, for sore need have you thereof; wherefore I pray and
 beseech you that you be guardian of the castle of Camelot, if
 that my lady mother shall come thither, for thereof make I you
 lord and champion, and albeit the castle be far away from you,
 yet garnish it and guard it, for it is builded in a place right
 fair."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 Lords, think not that it is this Camelot whereof these tellers
 of tales do tell their tales, there, where King Arthur so often
 held his court.  This Camelot that was the Widow Lady's stood
 upon the uttermost headland of the wildest isle of Wales by the
 sea to the West.  Nought was there save the hold and the forest
 and the waters that were round about it.  The other Camelot, of
 King Arthur's, was situate at the entrance of the kingdom of
 Logres, and was peopled of folk and was seated at the head of the
 King's land, for that he had in his governance all the lands that
 on that side marched with his own.
