 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch VII</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Here the story is silent of Messire Gawain and beginneth to speak
 of Lancelot, that entereth into a forest and rideth with right
 great ado and meeteth a knight in the midst of the forest that
 was coming full speed and was armed of all arms.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "Whence come you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "I come from the neighbourhood of King
 Arthur's Court."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir, can you tell me tidings of a knight that beareth a
 green shield such as I bear?  If so, he is my brother."
 </p><p>
 "What name hath he?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "His name is Gladoens, and he is a good knight
 and a hardy, and he hath a white horse right strong and swift."
 </p><p>
 "Be there other knights in your country that bear such arms as
 your shield and his besides you and he?"
 </p><p>
 "Certes, Sir, none."
 </p><p>
 "And wherefore do you ask?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "For this, that a certain man hath reft him of one of his castles
 for that he was not there.  Howbeit, I know well that he will
 have it again through his good knighthood."
 </p><p>
 "Is he so good knight?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Certes, Sir, yea!  He is the best of the Isles of the Moors."
 </p><p>
 "Sir, of your mercy, lower your coif."
 </p><p>
 He quickly thereon lowereth his coif, and Lancelot looketh at him
 in the face.  "Certes, Sir Knight," saith he, "you very much
 resemble him."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir," saith the knight, "Know you then any tidings of him?"
 </p><p>
 "Certes, Sir," saith he, "Yea!  and true tidings may I well say,
 for he rode at my side five leagues Welsh, nor never saw I one
 man so like another as are you to him."
 </p><p>
 "Good right hath he to resemble me," saith the knight, "for we
 are twins, but he was born first and hath more sense and
 knighthood than I; nor in all the Isles of the Moors is there
 damsel that hath so much worth and beauty as she of whom he is
 loved of right true love, and more she desireth to see him than
 aught else that liveth, for she hath not seen him of more than a
 year, wherefore hath she gone seek her prize, my brother, by all
 the forests of the world. Sir," saith the knight, "Let me go seek
 my brother, and tell me where I may find him."
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith Lancelot, "I will tell you though it grieve me
 sore."
 </p><p>
 "Wherefore?" saith the knight, "Hath he done you any mis-deed?"
 </p><p>
 "In no wise," saith Lancelot, "Rather hath he done so much for me
 that I love you thereof and offer you my service."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "I am going my way, but for God's sake
 tell me where I shall find my brother."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "I will tell you.  This morning did I bid
 his body farewell and help to bury him."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir," saith the knight, "Do you tell me true?"
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith Lancelot, "True it is that I tell you."
 </p><p>
 "Is he slain then, my brother?" saith the knight.
 </p><p>
 "Yea, and of succouring me," saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, sir," saith the knight, "For God's sake tell me nought that
 is not right."
 </p><p>
 "By God, Sir," saith he, "Sore grieved am I to tell it you, for
 never loved I knight so much in so brief a time as I loved him.
 He helped to save me from death, and therefore will I do for you
 according to that he did for me."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "If he be dead, a great grief is it to
 myself, for I have lost my comfort and my life and my land
 without recovery."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "He helped me to save my life, and yours
 will I help to save henceforth for ever and so be that I shall
 know of your jeopardy."
 </p><p>
 The knight heareth that his brother is dead and well believeth
 Lancelot, and beginneth to make dole thereof the greatest that
 was ever heard.  And Lancelot saith to him, "Sir Knight, let be
 this dole, for none recovery is there; but my body do I offer you
 and my knighthood in any place you please, where I may save your
 honour."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "With good will receive I your help and
 your love, sith that you deign to offer me the same, and now have
 I sorer need of them than ever. Sir," saith the knight, "Sith
 that my brother is dead, I will return back and bear with my
 wrong, though well would he have amended it had he been on live."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "I will go with you, that so may I
 reward you of that he hath done for me.  He delivered his body to
 the death for me, and in like manner freely would I fain set mine
 own in jeopardy for love of you and of him."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "Right good will do I owe you of this
 that you say to me, so your deeds be but the same herein."
 </p><p>
 "Yea, so help me God," saith Lancelot, "The same shall they be,
 if God lend me the power."
 </p><p>
 With that, they go on their way together, and the knight
 comforteth him much of that which Lancelot hath said to him, but
 of the death of his brother was he right sorrowful.  And they
 ride until they come to the land of the Moors; then espy they a
 castle upon a rock, and below was a broad meadow-land.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Knight of the Green Shield to Lancelot, "This
 castle was my brother's and is now mine, and much it misliketh me
 that it hath fallen to me on this wise.  And the knight that reft
 it of my brother is of so great hardihood that he feareth no
 knight on live, and you will presently see him issue forth of
 this castle so soon as he shall perceive you."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot and the knight ride until they draw nigh the castle. 
 And the knight looketh in the way before him, and seeth a squire
 coming on a hackney, that was carrying before him a wild boar
 dead.  The Knight of the Green Shield asketh him whose man he
 is, and the squire maketh answer: "I am man of the Lord of the
 Rock Gladoens, that cometh there behind, and my lord cometh all
 armed, he and others, for the brother of Gladoens hath defied him
 on behalf of his brother, but right little recketh my lord of his
 defiance."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot heareth how he that is coming is the enemy of him to
 whom had he been alive, his love most was due.  The Knight of the
 Green Shield pointed him out so soon as he saw him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he to Lancelot, "Behold him by whom I am disherited,
 and yet worse would he do to me and he knew that my brother were
 dead."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot, without saving more, so soon as he had espied the
 Knight of the Rock, smiteth his horse with his spurs and cometh
 toward him.  The Lord of the Rock, that was proud and hardy,
 seeth Lancelot coming and smiteth with his spurs the horse
 whereon he sitteth.  They come with so swift an onset either upon
 other that they break their spears upon their shields, and hurtle
 together so sore that the Knight of the Rock Gladoens falleth
 over the croup of his horse.  Lancelot draweth his sword and
 cometh above him, and he crieth him mercy and asketh him
 wherefore he wisheth to slay him?  Lancelot saith for the sake of
 Gladoens from whom he hath reft his land and his castle.  "And
 what is that to you?" saith the knight.  "Behoveth his brother
 challenge me thereof."
 </p><p>
 "As much it behoveth me as his brother," saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Wherefore you?"
 </p><p>
 "For this," saith Lancelot, "That as much as he did for me will I
 do to you."
 </p><p>
 He cutteth off his head and giveth it incontinent to the Knight
 of the Green Shield.
 </p><p>
 "Now tell me," saith Lancelot, "Sith that he is dead, is he
 purged of that whereof you appeached him?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "I hold him rightly quit thereof, for,
 sith that he is dead, all claim on behalf of his kindred is
 abated by his death."
 </p><p>
 "And I pledge you my faith loyally," saith Lancelot, "as I am a
 knight, that never shall you be in peril nor in jeopardy of aught
 wherein I may help you, so I be in place and free, but my help
 shall you have for evermore, for that your brother staked his
 life to help me."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot and the knight lay the night at the Rock Gladoens, and
 the Knight of the Green Shield had his land at his pleasure, and
 all were obedient to him.  And the upright and loyal were right
 glad, albeit when they heard the tidings of Gladoens' death they
 were right sorrowful thereof.  Lancelot departed from the castle
 on the morrow, and the knight remained therein, sorrowful for his
 brother that he had lost, and glad for the land that he had
 gotten again.  Lancelot goeth back right amidst the forest and
 rideth the day long, and meeteth a knight that was coming,
 groaning sore.  And he was stooping over the fore saddle-bow for
 the pain that he had.  He meeteth Lancelot and saith to him:
 "Sir, for God's sake, turn back, for you will find there the most
 cruel pass in the world there where I have been wounded through
 the body.  Wherefore I beseech you not go thither."
 </p><p>
 "What pass is it then?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "It is the pass of the Castle of Beards, and it
 hath the name of this, that every knight that passeth thereby
 must either leave his beard there or challenge the same, and in
 such sort have I challenged my beard that meseemeth I shall die
 thereof."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "I hold not this of cowardize, sith
 that you were hardy to set your life in jeopardy to challenge
 your beard, but now would you argue me of cowardize when you
 would have me turn back.  Rather would I be smitten through the
 body with honour, so and I had not my death thereof, than lose
 with shame a single hair of my beard."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "May God preserve you, for the castle is
 far more cruel than you think, and God guide the knight that may
 destroy the evil custom of the castle, for right shameful is the
 custom to strange knights that pass thereby."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot departeth from the knight and cometh toward the castle.
 Just as he had passed over a great bridge, he looketh about and
 seeth two knights come all armed to the entrance of the castle,
 and they made hold their horses before them, and their shields
 and spears are before them leaning against the wall.  Lancelot
 looketh at the gateway of the castle and seeth the great door all
 covered with beards fastened thereon, and heads of knights in
 great plenty hung thereby.  So, as he was about to enter the
 gate, two knights issue therefrom over against him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the one, "Abide and pay your toll!"
 </p><p>
 "Do knights, then, pay toll here?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Yea!" say the knights, "All they that have beards, and they that
 have none are quit.  Sir, now pay us yours, for a right great
 beard it is, and thereof have we sore need."
 </p><p>
 "For what?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "I will tell you," saith the knight.  "There be hermits in this
 forest that make hair-shirts thereof."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "Never shall they have hair-shirt
 of mine, so I may help it."
 </p><p>
 "That shall they," say the knights, "Of yours as of the other, or
 dearly shall you pay therefor!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 Right wroth waxeth Sir Lancelot, and cometh to the knight, and
 smiteth him with his spear amidst the breast with such a thrust
 that it passeth half an ell beyond, and overthroweth him and his
 horse together.  The other knight seeth his fellow wounded to the
 death, and cometh towards him with a great sweep and breaketh his
 spear upon his shield.  Howbeit, Lancelot beareth him to the
 ground right over his horse-croup and maketh him fall so heavily
 that he breaketh one of his legs.  The tidings are come to the
 Lady of the Castle that a knight hath come to the pass that hath
 slain one of her knights and wounded the other.  The Lady is come
 thither, and bringeth two of her damsels with her.  She seeth
 Lancelot that is fain to slay the knight that lieth wounded on
 the ground.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Lady to Lancelot, "Withdraw yourself back and
 slay him not, but alight and speak to me in safety."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith one of the maidens, "I know him well.  This is
 Lancelot of the Lake, the most courteous knight that is in the
 court of King Arthur."
 </p><p>
 He alighteth and cometh before the Lady.  "Lady," saith he, "what
 is your pleasure?"
 </p><p>
 "I desire," saith she, "that you come to my hostel to harbour,
 and that you make me amends of the shame you have done me."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Lancelot, "Shame have I never done you nor shall
 do, but the knights took in hand too shameful a business when
 they were minded to take the beards of stranger knights by
 force."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I will forego mine ill-will on condition that
 you harbour herewithin to-night."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Lancelot, "I desire not your ill-will, wherefore
 will I gladly do your pleasure."
 </p><p>
 He setteth him within the castle and maketh his horse be led in
 after him, and the Lady hath the dead knight brought into the
 chapel and buried.  The other she biddeth be disarmed and clothed
 and commandeth that his wounds be searched.  Then maketh she
 Lancelot be disarmed and clad right richly in a good robe, and
 telleth him that she knoweth well who he is.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Lancelot, "It is well for me."
 </p><p>
 Thereupon they sit to eat, and the first course is brought in by
 knights in chains that had their noses cut off; the second by
 knights in chains that had their eyes put out; wherefore they
 were led in by squires.  The third course was brought in by
 knights that had but one hand and were in chains.  After that,
 came other knights that had each but one foot and brought in the
 fourth course.  At the fifth course came knights right fair and
 tall, and each brought a naked sword in his hand and presented
 their heads to the Lady.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot beheld the martyrdom of these knights, and sore
 misliking had he of the services of such folk.  They are risen
 from meat and the lady goeth to her chamber and sitteth on a
 couch.
 </p><p>
 "Lancelot," saith the Lady, "you have seen the justice and the
 lordship of my castle.  All these knights have been conquered at
 the passing of my door."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Lancelot, "foul mischance hath befallen them."
 </p><p>
 "The like mischance would have befallen you had you not been
 knight so good.  And greatly have I desired to see you this long
 time past.  And I will make you lord of this castle and myself."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "the lordship of this castle hold I of yourself
 without mesne, and to you have I neither wish nor right to refuse
 it.  Rather am I willing to be at your service."
 </p><p>
 "Then," saith she, "you will abide with me in this castle, for
 more do I love you than any other knight that liveth."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Lancelot, "Gramercy, but in no castle may I abide
 more than one night until I have been thither whither behoveth me
 to go."
 </p><p>
 "Whither are you bound?" saith she.
 </p><p>
 "Lady, saith he, "to the Castle of Souls."
 </p><p>
 "Well know I the castle," saith she. "The King hath the name
 Fisherman, and lieth in languishment on account of two knights
 that have been at his castle and made not good demand.  Would you
 fain go thither?" saith the Lady.
 </p><p>
 "Yea," saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Then pledge me your faith that you will return by me to speak to
 me, so the Graal shall appear to you and you ask whereof it
 serveth."
 </p><p>
 "Yea, truly, saith Lancelot, "were you beyond sea!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith one of the damsels, "So much may you well promise,
 for the Graal appeareth not to no knight so wanton as be ye.  For
 you love the Queen Guenievre, the wife of your lord, King Arthur,
 nor so long as this love lieth at your heart may you never behold
 the Graal."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot heard the damsel and blushed of despite.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Lancelot," saith the Lady, "Love you other than me?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "the damsel may say her pleasure."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot lay the night at the castle, and right wroth was he of
 the damsel that calleth the love of him and the Queen disloyal.
 And the morrow when he had heard mass, he took leave of the Lady
 of the Castle, and she besought him over and over to keep his
 covenant, and he said that so would he do without fail.
 Therewithal he issueth forth of the castle and entereth into a
 tall and ancient forest, and rideth the day long until he cometh
 to the outskirt of the forest, and seeth a tall cross at the
 entrance of a burying-ground enclosed all round about with a
 hedge of thorns.  And the way lay through the burying ground.
 Lancelot entered therein and the night was come.  He seeth the
 graveyard full of tombs and sepulchres.  He looketh behind and
 seeth a chapel wherein were candles burning.  Thitherward goeth
 he, and passeth beyond without saying aught more by the side of a
 dwarf that was digging a grave in the ground.
 </p><p>
 "Lancelot," saith the dwarf, "you are right not to salute me, for
 you are the man of all the world that most I hate; and God grant
 me vengeance of your body.  So will He what time you are stricken
 down here within!"
 </p><p>
 Lancelot heard the dwarf, but deigned not to answer him of
 nought.  He is come to the chapel, and alighteth and maketh fast
 the bridle of his horse to a tree, and leaneth his shield and
 spear without.  After that he entereth into the chapel, and
 findeth a damsel laying out a knight in his winding-sheen.  As
 soon as Lancelot was entered therewithin the wounds of the knight
 were swollen up and began to bleed afresh.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir Knight, now see I plainly that you slew him that I am
 wrapping in his windingsheet!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you, two knights that are carrying other two
 knights dead.  They alight and then set them in the chapel.  And
 the dwarf crieth out to them: "Now shall it be seen how you
 avenge your friends of the enemy that fell upon you!"
 </p><p>
 The knight that had fled from the forest when Messire Gawain came
 thither where the three lay dead, was come therewithin and knew
 Lancelot, whereupon saith he: "Our mortal enemy are you, for by
 you were these three knights slain."
 </p><p>
 "Well had they deserved it," saith Lancelot, "and in this chapel
 am I in no peril of you, wherefore as at this time will I depart
 not hence, for I know not the ways of the forest."
 </p><p>
 He was in the chapel until the day broke, when he issued forth
 thereof, and sore it weighed upon him that his horse was still
 fasting.  He taketh his arms and is mounted. The dwarf crieth out
 aloud: "What aileth you?" saith he to the two knights, "Will you
 let your mortal enemy go thus?"
 </p><p>
 With that the two knights mount their horses and go to the two
 issues of the grave-yard, thinking that Lancelot is fain to flee
 therefrom; but no desire hath he thereof, wherefore he cometh to
 the knight that was guarding the entrance whereby he had to issue
 out, and smiteth him so stiffly that he thrusteth the point of
 his spear right through his body.  The other knight that was
 guarding the other entrance, that had fled out of the forest
 before, had no mind to avenge his fellow, and fled incontinent so
 fast as he might.  And Lancelot taketh the horse of the knight he
 had slain and driveth him before him, for he thinketh that some
 knight may haply have need thereof.  He rideth on until he cometh
 to a hermitage in the forest where he alighteth and hath his
 horses stabled, and the Hermit giveth them of the best he hath.
 And Lancelot heard mass, and afterward are a little and fell on
 sleep.  Thereafter, behold you, a knight that cometh to the
 Hermit and seeth Lancelot that was about to mount.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Whither go you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir Knight," saith Lancelot, "thither shall I go where God may
 please; but you, whitherward are you bound to go?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I go to see one of my brethren and my two sisters, for I
 have been told that he hath fallen on such mishap as that he is
 called the Poor Knight, whereof am I sore sorrowful."
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith Lancelot, "poor he is, the more the pity! 
 Howbeit, will you do him a message from me?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "Right willingly!"
 </p><p>
 "Will you present him with this horse on my behalf, and tell him
 how Lancelot that harboured with him hath sent it?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "Right great thanks, and blessed may you
 be, for he that doth a kindness to a worshipful man loseth it
 not."
 </p><p>
 "Salute the two damsels for me," saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, right willingly!"
 </p><p>
 The knight delivereth the horse to his squire, and taketh leave
 of Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, Lancelot departeth from the hermitage and rideth on
 until he cometh forth of the forest, and findeth a waste land, a
 country broad and long wherein wonned neither beast nor bird, for
 the land was so poor and parched that no victual was to be found
 therein.  Lancelot looketh before him and seeth a city appear far
 away.  Thither rideth he full speed and seeth that the city is so
 great that it seemeth him to encompass a whole country.  He seeth
 the walls that are falling all around, and the gates ruined with
 age.  He entereth within and findeth the city all void of folk,
 and seeth the great palaces fallen down and waste, and the great
 grave-yards full of sepulchres, and the tall churches all lying
 waste, and the markets and exchanges all empty.  He rideth amidst
 the streets, and findeth a great palace that seemeth him to be
 better and more ancient than all the others.  He bideth awhile
 before it and heareth within how knights and ladies are making
 great dole.  And they say to a knight: "Ha, God, sore grief and
 pity is this of you, that you must needs die in such manner, and
 that your death may not be respited!  Sore hatred ought we to
 bear toward him that hath adjudged you such a death."
 </p><p>
 The knights and ladies swoon over him as he departeth.  Lancelot
 hath heard all this and much marvelleth he thereof, but nought
 thereof may he see.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, lo you, the knight that cometh down into the midst of
 the hall, clad in a short red jerkin; and he was girt with a rich
 girdle of gold, and had a rich clasp at his neck wherein were
 many rich stones, and on his head had he a great cap of gold, and
 he held great axe.  The knight was of great comeliness and young
 of age.  Lancelot seeth him coming, and looketh upon him right
 fainly when he seeth him appear.  And the knight saith to him,
 "Sir, alight!"
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith Lancelot, "Willingly."
 </p><p>
 He alighteth and maketh his horse fast to a ring of silver that
 was on the mounting-stage, and putteth his shield from his neck
 and his spear from his hand.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he to the knight, "What is your pleasure?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, needs must you cut me off my head with this axe, for of
 this weapon hath my death been adjudged, but and you will not, I
 will cut off your own therewith."
 </p><p>
 "Hold, Sir," saith Lancelot, "What is this you tell me?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "you must needs do even as I say, sith
 that you are come into this city."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "Right foolish were he that in such a
 jeopardy should not do the best for himself, but blamed shall I
 be thereof and I shall slay you when you have done me no wrong."
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith the Knight, "In no otherwise may you go hence."
 </p><p>
 "Fair Sir," saith Lancelot, "So gentle are you and so well
 nurtured, how cometh it that you take your death so graciously?
 You know well that I shall kill you before you shall kill me,
 sith that so it is."
 </p><p>
 "This know I well for true," saith the Knight, "But you will
 promise me before I die, that you will return into this city
 within a year from this, and that you will set your head in the
 same jeopardy without challenge, as I have set mine."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "Needeth no argument that I shall
 choose respite of death to dying here on the spot.  But I marvel
 me of this that you are so fairly apparelled to receive your
 death."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIII.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Knight, "He that would go before the Saviour of
 the World ought of right to apparel him as fairly as he may.  I
 am by confession purged of all wickedness and of all the misdeeds
 that ever I have committed, and do repent me truly thereof,
 wherefore at this moment am I fain to die."
 </p><p>
 Therewithal he holdeth forth the axe, and Lancelot taketh it and
 seeth that it is right keen and well whetted.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Knight, "Hold up your hand toward the minster
 that you see yonder."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "Willingly."
 </p><p>
 "Thus, then, will you swear to me upon the holy relics that are
 within this minster, that on this day year at the hour that you
 shall have slain me, or before, you yourself will come back here
 and place your head in the very same peril as I shall have placed
 mine, without default?"
 </p><p>
 "Thus," saith Lancelot, "do I swear and give you thereto my
 pledge."
 </p><p>
 With that, the Knight kneeleth and stretcheth his neck as much as
 he may, and Lancelot taketh the axe in his hands, and then saith
 to him, "Sir Knight, for God's sake, have mercy on yourself!"
 </p><p>
 "Let cut off my head!" saith the Knight, "For otherwise may I not
 have mercy upon you!"
 </p><p>
 "In God's name," saith Lancelot, "fain would I deny you!"
 </p><p>
 With that, he swingeth the axe and cutteth off the head with such
 a sweep that he maketh it fly seven foot high from the body.  The
 Knight fell to the ground when his head was cut off, and Lancelot
 flung down the axe, and thinketh that he will make but an ill
 stay there for himself.  He cometh to his horse, and taketh his
 arms and mounteth and looketh behind him, but seeth neither the
 body of the Knight nor the head, neither knoweth he what hath
 become of them all, save only that he heard much dole and a great
 cry far off in the city of knights and ladies, saying that he
 shall be avenged, please God, at the term set, or before.
 Lancelot hath heard and understood all that the knights say and
 the ladies, and issueth forth of the city.
