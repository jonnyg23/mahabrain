 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch II</h1> 
 Now beginneth here the second branch of the Holy Graal the name
 of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.

 TITLE I
 </p><p>
 King Arthur was at Cardoil with the Queen and right few knights.
 By God's pleasure, the wish and the will had come back to him to
 win honour and to do largesse as most he might.  He made seal his
 letters and sent them throughout all his lands and all the
 islands, and gave notice to the barons and knights that he would
 hold court at Pannenoisance, that is situate the sea of Wales, at
 the feast of S. John after Whitsuntide.  And he was minded to put
 it off until that day, for that suntide was already too nigh, and
 they that should be thereat might not all come by the earlier
 day.  The tidings went through all lands, so that knights come in
 great plenty thereunto, for well-doing had so waxed feeble in all
 the kingdoms, that every one had avoided King Arthur as one that
 should do nought more for ever.  Wherefore all began now to
 marvel whence his new desire had come.  The knights of the Table
 Round that were scattered through the lands and the forests, by
 God's will learnt the tidings and right great joy had they
 thereof, and came back to the court with great ado.  But neither
 Messire Gawain nor Lancelot came thither on that day.  But all
 the other came that were then on live.  S. John's day came, and
 the knights were come from all parts, marvelling much that the
 King had not held the court at Whitsuntide, but they knew not the
 occasion thereof.  The day was fair and clear and the air fresh,
 and the hall was wide and high and garnished of good knights in
 great plenty.  The cloths were spread on the tables whereof were
 great plenty in the hall.  The King and the Queen had washen and
 went to sit at the head of one table and the other knights sate
 them down, whereof were full five score and five as the story
 telleth.  Kay the Seneschal and Messire Ywain the son of King
 Urien served that day at the tables at meat, and five-and-twenty
 knights beside.  And Lucan the Butler served the golden cup
 before the King.  The sun shone through the windows everywhere
 amidst the hall that was strown of flowers and rushes and sweet
 herbs and gave out a smell like as had it been sprinkled of balm.
 And straightway after the first meat had been served, and while
 they were yet awaiting the second, behold you three damsels where
 they enter into the hall!  She that came first sate upon a mule
 white as driven snow and had a golden bridle and a saddle with a
 bow of ivory banded with precious stones and a saddle-cloth of a
 red samite dropped of gold.  The damsel that was seated on the
 mule was right seemly of body but scarce so fair of face, and she
 was robed in a rich cloth of silk and gold and had a right rich
 hat that covered all her head.  And it was all loaded of costly
 stones that flamed like fire.  And great need had she that her
 head were covered, for she was all bald without hair, and carried
 on her neck her right arm slung in a stole of cloth of gold.  And
 her arm lay on a pillow, the richest that ever might be seen, and
 it was all charged of little golden bells, and in this hand held
 she the head of a King sealed in silver and crowned with gold.
 The other damsel that came behind rode after the fashion of a
 squire, and carried a pack trussed behind her with a brachet
 thereupon, and at her neck she bore a shield banded argent and
 azure with a red cross, and the boss was of gold all set with
 precious stones.  The third damsel came afoot with her kirtle
 tucked up like a running footman; and she had in her hand a whip
 wherewith she drove the two steeds.  Each of these twain was
 fairer than the first, but the one afoot surpassed both the
 others in beauty.  The first cometh before the King, there where
 he sitteth at meat with the Queen.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "The Saviour of the world grant you honour and
 joy and good adventure and my Lady the Queen and all them of this
 hall for love of you!  Hold it not churlishness and I alight not,
 for there where knights be may I not alight, nor ought I until
 such time as the Graal be achieved."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "Gladly would I have it so."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "That know I well, and may it not mislike you
 to hear the errand whereon I am come,"
 </p><p>
 "It shall not mislike me," saith the King, "say your pleasure!" 
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "The shield that this damsel beareth belonged
 to Joseph, the good soldier knight that took down Our Lord of
 hanging on the rood.  I make you a present thereof in such wise
 as I shall tell you, to wit, that you keep the shield for a
 knight that shall come hither for the same, and you shall make
 hang it on this column in the midst of your hall, and guard it in
 such wise as that none may take it and hang at his neck save he
 only.  And of this shield shall he achieve the Graal, and another
 shield shall he leave here in the hall, red, with a white hart;
 and the brachet that the damsel carrieth shall here remain, and
 little joy will the brachet make until the knight shall come."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "The shield and the brachet will we
 keep full safely, and right heartily we thank you that you have
 deigned to bring them hither."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "I have not yet told you all that I have
 in charge to deliver.  The best King that liveth on earth and the
 most loyal and the most righteous, sendeth you greeting; of whom
 is sore sorrow for that he hath fallen into a grievous
 languishment."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "Sore pity is it and it be so as you
 say; and I pray you tell me who is the King?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "It is rich King Fisherman, of whom is great
 grief."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "You say true; and God grant him his
 heart's desire!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Know you wherefore he hath fallen into
 languishment?"
 </p><p>
 "Nay, I know not at all, but gladly would I learn."
 </p><p>
 "And I will tell you," saith she.  "This languishment is come
 upon him through one that harboured in his hostel, to whom the
 most Holy Graal appeared.  And, for that he would not ask unto
 whom one served thereof, were all the lands commoved to war
 thereby, nor never thereafter might knight meet other but he
 should fight with him in arms without none other occasion.  You
 yourself may well perceive the same, for your well-doing hath
 greatly slackened, whereof have you had much blame, and all the
 other barons that by you have taken ensample, for you are the
 mirror of the world alike in well-doing and in evil-doing.  Sir,
 I myself have good right to plain me of the knight, and I will
 show you wherefore."
 </p><p>
 She lifteth the rich hat from her head and showeth the King and
 Queen and the knights in the hall her head all bald without hair.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "My head was right seemly garnished of hair
 plaited in rich tresses of gold at such time as the knight came
 to the hostel of the rich King Fisherman, but I became bald for
 that he made not the demand, nor never again shall I have my hair
 until such time as a knight shall go thither that shall ask the
 question better than did he, or the knight that shall achieve the
 Graal.  Sir, even yet have you not seen the sore mischief that
 hath befallen thereof.  There is without this hall a car that
 three white harts have drawn hither, and lightly may you send to
 see how rich it is. I tell you that the traces are of silk and
 the axletrees of gold, and the timber of the car is ebony.  The
 car is covered above with a black samite, and below is a cross of
 gold the whole length, and under the coverlid of the car are the
 heads of an hundred and fifty knights whereof some be sealed in
 gold, other some in silver and the third in lead.  King Fisherman
 sendeth you word that this loss I hath befallen of him that
 demanded not unto whom one serveth of the Graal.  Sir, the damsel
 that beareth the shield holdeth in her hand the head of a Queen
 that is sealed in lead and crowned with copper, and I tell you
 that by the Queen whose head you here behold was the King
 betrayed whose head I bear, and the three manner of knights whose
 heads are within the car.  Sir, send without to see the
 costliness and fashion of the car."
 </p><p>
 The King sent Kay the Seneschal to see.  He looked straitly
 thereat within and without and thereafter returned to the King.
 "Sir," saith he, "Never beheld I car so rich, and there be three
 harts withal that draw the car, the tallest and fattest one might
 ever see.  But and you will be guided by me, you will take the
 foremost, for he is scarce so far, and so might you bid make
 right good collops thereof."
 </p><p>
 "Avoid there, Kay!" saith the King.  "Foul churlishness have you
 spoken!  I would not such a deed were done for another such
 kingdom as is this of Logres!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "He that hath been wont to do
 churlishness doth right grudgingly withdraw himself therefrom.
 Messire Kay may say whatsoever him pleaseth, but well know I that
 you will pay no heed to his talk.  Sir," saith the damsel,
 "Command that the shield be hung on this column and that the
 brachet be put in the Queen's chamber with the maidens.  We will
 go on our way, for here have we been long enough."
 </p><p>
 Messire Ywain laid hold on the shield and took it off the
 damsel's neck by leave of the King, and hung it on the column in
 the midst of the hall, and one of the Queen's maidens taketh the
 brachet and carrieth him to the Queen's chamber.  And the damsel
 taketh her leave and turneth again, and the King commendeth her
 to God.  When the King eaten in hall, the Queen with the King and
 the knights go to lean at the windows to look at the three
 damsels and the three white harts that draw the car, and the more
 part said that the damsel afoot that went after the two that were
 mounted should have the most misease.  The bald damsel went
 before, and set not her hat on her head until such time as
 behoved her enter into the forest; and the knights that were at
 the windows might see them no longer.  Then set she her hat again
 upon her head.  The King, the Queen, and the knights when they
 might see them no more, came down from the windows, and certain
 of them said that never until this time had they seen bald-headed
 damsel save this one only.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 Hereupon the story is silent of King Arthur, and turneth again to
 speak of the three damsels and the car that was drawn by the
 three white harts.  They are entered into the forest and ride on
 right busily.  When they had left the castle some seven leagues
 Welsh behind them, they saw a knight coming toward them on the
 way they had to go.  The knight sat on a tall horse, lean and
 bony.  His habergeon was all rusty and his shield pierced in more
 than a dozen places, and the colour thereon was so fretted away
 that none might make out the cognizance thereof.  And a right
 thick spear bore he in his hand.  When he came anigh the damsel,
 he saluted her right nobly.
 </p><p>
 "Fair welcome, damsel, to you and your company."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "God grant you joy and good adventure!"
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the knight, "Whence come you?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, from a court high-plenary that King Arthur holdeth at
 Pannenoisance.  Go you thither, sir knight," saith the damsel,
 "to see the King and the Queen and the knights that are there?"
 </p><p>
 "Nay, not so!" saith he.  "Many a time have I seen them, but
 right glad am I of King Arthur that he hath again taken up his
 well-doing, for many a time hath he been accustomed thereof."
 </p><p>
 "Whitherward have you now emprised your way?" saith the damsel.
 </p><p>
 "To the land of King Fisherman, and God allow me."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Tell me your name and bide awhile beside me."
 </p><p>
 The knight draweth bridle and the damsels and the car come to a
 stay.  "Damsel," saith he, "Well behoveth me tell you my name.
 Messire Gawain am I called, King Arthur's nephew."
 </p><p>
 "What?  are you Messire Gawain?  my heart well told me as much."
 </p><p>
 "Yea, damsel," saith he, "Gawain am I."
 </p><p>
 "God be praised thereof, for so good knight as are you may well
 go see the rich King Fisherman.  Now am I fain to pray you of the
 valour that is in you and the courtesy, that you return with me
 and convoy me beyond a certain castle that is in this forest
 whereof is some small peril."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Willingly, at your pleasure."
 </p><p>
 He returneth with the damsel through the midst of the forest that
 was tall and leafy and little haunted of folk.  The damsel
 relateth to him the adventure of the heads that she carried and
 that were in the car, like as she did at the court of King
 Arthur, and of the shield and the brachet she had left there, but
 much it misliked Messire Gawain of the damsel that was afoot
 behind them.  "Damsel,"  saith Messire Gawain, "Wherefore doth
 not this damsel that goeth afoot mount upon the car?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "This shall she not, for behoveth her go not
 otherwise than afoot.  But and you be so good knight as men say,
 betimes will she have done her penance."
 </p><p>
 "How so?" saith Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "I will tell you," saith she.  "And it shall so be that God bring
 you to the hostel of rich King Fisherman, and the most Holy Graal
 appear before you and you demand unto whom is served thereof,
 then will she have done her penance, and I, that am bald, shall
 receive again my hair.  And so you also make not demand thereof,
 then will it behove us suffer sore annoy until such time as the
 Good knight shall come and shall have achieved the Graal.  For on
 account of him that first was there and made not the demand, are
 all the lands in sorrow and warfare, and the good King Fisherman
 is yet in languishment."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "God grant me courage and will
 herein that I may come to do this thing according to your wish,
 whereof may I win worship both of God and of the world."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain and the damsels go on their way a great pace
 through the high forest, green and leafy, where the birds are
 singing, and enter into the most hideous forest and most horrible
 that any might ever see, and seemed it that no greenery never
 there had been, so bare and dry were all the branches and all the
 trees black and burnt as it had been by fire, and the ground all
 parched and black atop with no green, and full of great cracks.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "Right loathly is this forest and
 right hideous.  Goeth it on far like this?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir." saith she, "For nine leagues Welsh goeth it on the same,
 but we shall pass not through the whole thereof."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain 1ooketh from time to time on the damsel that
 cometh arbor, and sore it irketh him that he may not amend her
 estate.  They ride on until that they come to a great valley and
 Messire Gawain looketh along the bottom and seeth appear a black
 castle that was enclosed within a girdle of wall, foul and
 evilseeming.  The nigher he draweth to the castle the more
 hideous it seemeth him, and he seeth great halls appear that were
 right foully mis-shapen, and the forest about it he seeth to be
 like as he had found it behind.  He seeth a water come down from
 the head of a mountain, foul and horrible and black, that went
 amidst the castle roaring so loud that it seemed to be thunder.
 Messire Gawain seeth the entrance of the gateway foul and
 horrible like as it had been hell, and within the castle heard he
 great outcries and lamentations, and the most part heard he
 saying: "Ha, God!  What hath become of the Good Knight, and when
 will he come?"
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "What is this castle here that is
 so foul and hideous, wherein is such dolour suffered and such
 weary longing for the coming of the Good Knight?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, this is the castle of the Black Hermit.  Wherefore am I
 fain to pray you that you meddle not herein for nought that they
 within may do to me, for otherwise it may well be that your death
 is at hand, for against them will you have no might nor power." 
 </p><p>
 They come anigh the castle as it were a couple of bow-shots, and
 behold, through the gateway come knights armed on black horses
 and their arms all black and their shields and spears, and there
 were a hundred and fifty and two, right parlous to behold.  And
 they come a great gallop toward the damsel, and toward the car,
 and take the hundred and fifty-two heads, each one his own, and
 set them upon their spears and so enter into the castle again
 with great joy.  Messire Gawain seeth the insolence that the
 knights have wrought, and right great shame hath he of himself
 that he hath not moved withal.
 </p><p>
 "Messire Gawain," saith the damsel, "Now may you know how little
 would your force have availed you herein."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel, an evil castle is this where folk are robbed on such
 wise."
 </p><p>
 "Sir, never may this mischief be amended, nor this outrage be
 done away, nor the evil-doer therein be stricken down, nor they
 that cry and lament within the prison there be set free until
 such time as the Good Knight shall come for whom are they
 yearning as you have heard but now."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel, right glad may the knight be that by his valour and his
 hardiment shall destroy so many evil folk!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, therefore is he the Best Knight in the world, and he is yet
 young enough of age, but right sorrowful am I at heart that I
 know not true tidings of him; for better will have I to see him
 than any man on live."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel, so also have I," saith Messire Gawain, "For then by your
 leave would I turn me again."
 </p><p>
 "Not so, sir, but and you shall come beyond I the castle, then
 will I teach you the way whereby you ought to go."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 With that they go toward the castle all together.  Just as they
 were about to pass beyond the castle wall, behold you where a
 knight cometh forth of a privy postern of the castle, and he was
 sitting upon a tall horse, his spear in his fist, and at his neck
 had he a red shield whereon was figured a golden eagle. "Sir
 knight," saith he to Messire Gawain, "I pray you bide."
 </p><p>
 "What is your pleasure?"
 </p><p>
 "You must needs joust with me," saith he "and conquer this
 shield, or otherwise I shall conquer you.  And full precious is
 the shield, insomuch as that great pains ought you to take to
 have it and conquer it, for it belonged to the best knight of his
 faith that was ever, and the most puissant and the wisest."
 </p><p>
 "Who, then, was he?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Judas Machabee was he, and he it was that first wrought how by
 one bird to take another."
 </p><p>
 "You say true," saith Messire Gawain; "A good knight was he." 
 </p><p>
 "Therefore right joyful may you be," saith he, "and you may
 conquer the same, for your own is the poorest and most battered
 that ever saw I borne by knight.  For hardly may a man know the
 colour thereof."
 </p><p>
 "Thereby may you well see," saith the damsel to the knight, "that
 his own shield hath not been idle, nor hath the horse whereon he
 sitteth been stabled so well as yours."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the knight, "No need is here of long pleading.
 Needs must he joust with me, for him do I defy."
 </p><p>
 Saith Messire Gawain, "I hear well that you say."
 </p><p>
 He draweth him back and taketh his career and the knight
 likewise, and they come together as fast as their horses may
 carry them, spear in rest.  The knight smiteth Messire Gawain on
 the shield whereof he had no great defence, and passeth beyond,
 and in the by-pass the knight to-brake his spear; and Messire
 Gawain smiteth him with his spear in the midst of his breast and
 beareth him to the ground over the croup of his horse, all pinned
 upon his spear, whereof he had a good full hand's breadth in his
 breast.  He draweth his spear back to him, and when the knight
 felt himself unpinned, he leaped to his feet and came straight to
 his horse and would fain set his foot in the stirrup when the
 damsel of the car crieth out: "Messire Gawain, hinder the knight!
 for and he were mounted again, too sore travail would it be to
 conquer him!"
 </p><p>
 When the knight heard name Messire Gawain, he draweth him back:
 "How?" saith he; "Is this then the good Gawain, King Arthur's
 nephew?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea," saith the damsel, "He it is without fail!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight to Messire Gawain, "Are you he?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea," saith he, "Gawain I am!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, so please you," saith he, "I hold me conquered, and right
 sorry am I that I knew you not or ever I had ado with you."
 </p><p>
 He taketh the shield from his neck and holdeth it to him.  "Sir,"
 saith he, "Take the shield that belonged to the best knight that
 was in his time of his faith, for none know I of whom it shall be
 better employed than of you.  And of this shield were vanquished
 all they that be in prison in this castle."  Messire Gawain
 taketh the shield that was right fair and rich.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "Now give me yours, for you will not
 bear two shields."
 </p><p>
 "You say true," saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 He taketh the guige from his neck and would have given him the
 shield, when the damsel afoot: "Hold, sir knight, you that are
 named Messire Gawain!  What would you do?  And he bear your
 shield into the castle there, they of the castle will hold you
 recreant and conquered, and will come forth thence and carry you
 into the castle by force, and there will you be cast into his
 grievous prison; for no shield is borne thereinto save of a
 vanquished knight only."
 </p><p>
 "Sir knight," saith Messire Gawain, "No good you wish me,
 according to that this damsel saith."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "I cry you mercy, and a second time I
 hold me conquered, and right glad should I have been might I have
 borne your shield within yonder, and right great worship should I
 have had thereof, for never yet hath entered there the shield of
 knight so good.  And now ought I to be right well pleased of your
 coming, sith that you have set me free of the sorest trouble that
 ever knight had."
 </p><p>
 "What is the trouble?" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "I will tell you.  Heretofore many a time hath
 there been a passing by of knights both of hardy and of coward,
 and it was my business to contend and joust with them and do
 battle, and I made them present of the shield as did I you.  The
 more part found I hardy and well able to defend themselves, that
 wounded me in many places, but never was knight so felled me to
 the ground nor dealt me so sore a buffet as have you.  And sith
 that you are carrying away the shield and I am conquered, never
 here-after shall knight that passeth before this castle have no
 dread of me nor of no knight that is herein."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Messire Gawain, "Now am I gladder of my
 conquest than I was before."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "By your leave will I go my way, for,
 and I may hide not my shame in the castle, needs must I show it
 openly abroad."
 </p><p>
 "God grant you do well!" saith Messire Gawain.
 </p><p>
 "Messire Gawain," saith the Damsel of the Car, "give me your
 shield that the knight would fain have carried off."
 </p><p>
 "Willingly, damsel," saith he.  The damsel that went afoot taketh
 the shield and setteth it in the car.  Howbeit, the knight that
 was conquered mounted again upon his horse, and entered again
 into the castle, and when he was come thereinto, arose a noise
 and great outcry so loud that all the forest and all the valley
 began to resound thereof.  "Messire Gawain," saith the Damsel of
 the Car, "the knight is shamed and there cast in prison another
 time.  Now haste, Messire Gawain!  for now may you go!"
 </p><p>
 With that they all set forward again upon their way together, and
 leave the castle an English league behind.  "Damsel," saith
 Messire Gawain, "When it shall please you, I shall have your
 leave to go."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "God be guard of your body, and right great
 thanks of your convoy."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "My service is always ready at your command."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "Gramercy, and your own way see you
 there by yonder great cross at the entrance of yonder forest. 
 And beyond that, will you find the fairest forest and most
 delightsome when you shall have passed through this that sore is
 wearisome."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain turneth him to go, and the damsel afoot crieth out
 to him: "Sir, not so heedful are you as I supposed."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain turneth his horse's head as he that was startled:
 "Wherefore say you so, damsel?" saith he.
 </p><p>
 "For this," saith she, "That you have never asked of my Damsel
 wherefore she carrieth her arm slung at her neck in this golden
 stole, nor what may be the rich pillow whereon the arm lieth. 
 And no greater heed will you take at the court of the rich King
 Fisherman."
 </p><p>
 "Sweet, my friend," saith the Damsel of the Car, "blame not
 Messire Gawain only, but King Arthur before him and all the
 knights that were in the court.  For not one of them all that
 were there was so heedful as to ask me.  Go your ways, Messire
 Gawain, for in vain would you now demand it, for I will tell you
 not, nor shall you never know it save only by the most coward
 knight in the world, that is mine own knight and goeth to seek me
 and knoweth not where to find me."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Messire Gawain, "I durst not press you further."
 </p><p>
 With that the Damsel departeth, and Messire Gawain setteth him
 forward again on the way that she had taught him.
