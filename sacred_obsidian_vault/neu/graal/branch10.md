 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch X</h1> 
 INCIPIT.
 <p>
 Another branch of the Graal again beginneth in the name of the
 Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 TITLE I.
 </p><p>
 And the story is here silent of Perceval, and saith that Lancelot
 goeth his way and rideth by a forest until he findeth a castle
 amidst his way at the head of a launde, and seeth at the gateway
 of the castle an old knight and two damsels sitting on a bridge.
 Thitherward goeth he, and the knight and damsels rise up to meet
 him, and Lancelot alighteth.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Vavasour, "Welcome may you be."
 </p><p>
 The damsels make great joy of him and lead him into the castle.
 "Sir," saith the Vavasour, "Sore need had we of your coming."
 </p><p>
 He maketh him go up into the hall above and be disarmed of his
 arms. "Sir," saith the Vavasour, "Now may you see great pity of
 these two damsels that are my daughters.  A certain man would
 reave them of this castle for that no aid nor succour have they
 save of me alone.  And little enough can I do, for I am old and
 feeble, and my kin also are of no avail, insomuch that hitherto
 have I been able to find no knight that durst defend me from the
 knight that is fain to reave this castle from me.  And you seem
 to be of so great valiance that you will defend me well herein
 to-morrow, for the truce cometh to an end to-night."
 </p><p>
 "How?" saith Lancelot, "I have but scarce come in hither to
 lodge, and you desire me so soon already to engage myself in
 battle?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Vavasour, "Herein may it well be proven whether
 there be within you as much valour as there seemeth from without
 to be.  For, and you make good the claim of these two damsels
 that are my daughters to the fiefs that are of right their own,
 you will win thereby the love of God as well as praise of the
 world."
 </p><p>
 They fall at his feet weeping, and pray him of mercy that they
 may not be disherited.  And he raiseth them forthwith, as one
 that hath great pity thereof.
 </p><p>
 "Damsels," saith he, "I will aid you to my power.  But I would
 fain that the term be not long."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they, "to-morrow is the day, and to-morrow, so we have
 no knight to meet him that challengeth this castle, we shall have
 lost it.  And our father is an old knight, and hath no longer
 lustihood nor force whereby he might defend it for us, and all of
 our lineage are fallen and decayed.  This hatred hath fallen on
 us on account of Messire Gawain, whom we harboured."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot lay there the night within the castle and was right well
 lodged and worshipfully entreated.  And on the morrow he armed
 himself when he had heard mass, and leant at the windows of the
 hall and seeth the gate shut and barred, and heareth a horn sound
 without the gate three times right loud.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Vavasour, "the knight is come, and thinketh that
 within here is no defence."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "but there is, please God!"
 </p><p>
 The knight bloweth another blast of his horn.
 </p><p>
 "Hearken, Sir," saith the Vavasour, "It is nigh noon, and he
 thinketh him that none will issue hence to meet him."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot cometh down below and findeth his horse saddled and is
 mounted as soon.  The damsels are at his stirrup, and pray him
 for God's sake remember to defend the honour that is theirs of
 the castle, for, save only he so doth, they must flee like
 beggars into other lands.  Thereupon the Knight soundeth his horn
 again.  Lancelot, when he heareth the blast, hath no mind to
 abide longer, and forthwith issueth out of the castle all armed,
 lance in hand and shield at his neck.  He seeth the knight at the
 head of the bridge, all armed under a tree.  Thitherward cometh
 Lancelot full speed.  The knight seeth him coming, and crieth to
 him.
 </p><p>
 "Sir Knight," saith he, "What demand you?  Come you hither to do
 me evil?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea," saith Lancelot, "for that evil are you fain to do to this
 castle; wherefore on behalf of the Vavasour and his daughters do
 I defy you."
 </p><p>
 He moveth against the knight and smiteth him on the shield with
 his spear and the knight him.  But Lancelot pierceth his shield
 for him with his sword, and smiteth him so stiffly that he
 pinneth his arm to his side, and hurtleth against him so passing
 stoutly that he thrusteth him to the ground, him and his horse,
 and runneth over him, sword drawn.
 </p><p>
 "Ha," saith the knight to Lancelot, "withdraw a little from over
 me, and slay me not, and tell me your name, of your mercy."
 </p><p>
 "What have you to do with my name?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "Gladly would I know it, for a right good knight
 seem you to be, and so have I well proven in the first
 encounter."
 </p><p>
 "Sir" saith he, "I am called Lancelot of the Lake.  And what is
 your name?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir." saith he, "I am called Marin of the castle of Gomeret.  So
 am I -- father of Meliot of Logres.  I pray you, by that you most
 love in the world, that you slay me not."
 </p><p>
 "So will I do," saith Lancelot, "and you renounce not your feud
 against this castle."
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith the knight, "thus do I renounce it, and I
 pledge myself that thenceforth for ever shall it have no
 disturbance of me."
 </p><p>
 "Your pledge," saith Lancelot, "will I not accept save you come
 in thither."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "You have sore wounded me in such sort
 that I cannot mount but with right great pain."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot helpeth him until he was mounted again on his horse, and
 leadeth him into the castle with him, and maketh him present his
 sword to the Vavasour and his daughters, and yield up his shield
 and his arms, and afterward swear upon hallows that never again
 will he make war upon them.  Lancelot thereupon receiveth his
 pledge to forego all claim to the castle and Marin turneth him
 back to Gomeret.  The Vavasour and his daughters abide in great
 joy.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 The story saith that Lancelot went his way by strange lands and
 by forests to seek adventure, and rode until he found a plain
 land lying without a city that seemed to be of right great
 lordship.  As he was riding by the plain land, he looketh toward
 the forest and seeth the plain fair and wide and the land right
 level.  He rideth all the plain, and looketh toward the city and
 seeth great plenty of folk issuing forth thereof.  And with them
 was there much noise of bag-pipes and flutes and viols and many
 instruments of music, and they came along the way wherein was
 Lancelot riding.  When the foremost came up to him, they halted
 and redoubled their joy.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they, "Welcome may you be!"
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith Lancelot, "Whom come ye to meet with such joy?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they, "they that come behind there will tell you
 clearly that whereof we are in need."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon behold you the provosts and the lords of the city, and
 they come over against Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they, "All this joy is made along of you, and all
 these instruments of music are moved to joy and sound of gladness
 for your coming."
 </p><p>
 "But wherefore for me," saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "That shall you know well betimes," say they.  "This city began
 to burn and to melt in one of the houses from the very same hour
 that our king was dead, nor might the fire be quenched, nor never
 will be quenched until such time as we have a king that shall be
 lord of the city and of the honour thereunto belonging, and on
 New Year's Day behoveth him to be crowned in the midst of the
 fire, and then shall the fire be quenched, for otherwise may it
 never be put out nor extinguished.  Wherefore have we come to
 meet you to give you the royalty, for we have been told that you
 are a good knight."
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith Lancelot, "Of such a kingdom have I no need, and
 God defend me from it."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," they say, "You may not be defended thereof, for you come
 into this land at hazard, and great grief would it be that so
 good land as you see this is were burnt and melted away by the
 default of one single man, and the lordship is right great, and
 this will be right great worship to yourself, that on New Year's
 Day you should be crowned in the fire and thus save this city and
 this great people, and thereof shall you have great praise."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 Much marvelleth Lancelot of this that they say.  They come round
 about him on all sides and lead him into the city.  The ladies
 and damsels are mounted to the windows of the great houses and
 make great joy, and say the one to another, "Look at the new king
 here that they are leading in.  Now will he quench the fire on
 New Year's Day."
 </p><p>
 "Lord!" say the most part, "What great pity is it of so comely a
 knight that he shall end on such-wise!"
 </p><p>
 "Be still!" say the others.  "Rather should there be great joy
 that so fair city as is this should be saved by his death, for
 prayer will be made throughout all the kingdom for his soul for
 ever!"
 </p><p>
 Therewith they lead him to the palace with right great joy and
 say that they will crown him.  Lancelot found the palace all
 strown with rushes and hung about with curtains of rich cloths of
 silk, and the lords of the city all apparelled to do him homage.
 But he refuseth right stoutly, and saith that their king nor
 their lord will he never be in no such sort.  Thereupon behold
 you a dwarf that entereth into the city, leading one of the
 fairest dames that be in any kingdom, and asketh whereof this joy
 and this murmuring may be.  They tell him they are fain to make
 the knight king, but that he is not minded to allow them, and
 they tell him the whole manner of the fire.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 The dwarf and the damsel are alighted, then they mount up to the
 palace.  The dwarf calleth the provosts of the city and the
 greater lords.
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith he, "sith that this knight is not willing to be
 king, I will be so willingly, and I will govern the city at your
 pleasure and do whatsoever you have devised to do."
 </p><p>
 "In faith, sith that the knight refuseth this honour and you
 desire to have it, willingly will we grant it you, and he may go
 his way and his road, for herein do we declare him wholly quit."
 </p><p>
 Therewithal they set the crown on the dwarf's head, and Lancelot
 maketh great joy thereof.  He taketh his leave, and they command
 him to God, and so remounteth he on his horse and goeth his way
 through the midst of the city all armed.  The dames and damsels
 say that he would not be king for that he had no mind to die so
 soon.  When he came forth of the city right well pleased was he.
 He entereth a great forest and rideth on till daylight began to
 fall, and seeth before him a hermitage newly stablished, for the
 house and the chapel were all builded new.  He cometh thitherward
 and alighteth to lodge.  The hermit, that was young without beard
 or other hair on his face, issued from his chapel.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he to Lancelot, "you are he that is welcome."
 </p><p>
 "And you, sir, good adventure to you," saith Lancelot.  "Never
 have I seen hermit so young as you."
 </p><p>
 "Sir, of this only do I repent me, that I came not hither ere
 now."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 Therewith he maketh his horse be stabled, and leadeth him into
 his hermitage, and so maketh disarm him and setteth him at ease
 as much as he may.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "Can you tell me any tidings of a knight
 that hath lain sick of a long time in the house of a hermit?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "it is no long time agone sithence I saw
 him in the house of the good King Hermit, that hath tended me and
 healed me right sweetly of the wounds that the knight gave me."
 </p><p>
 "And is the knight healed, then?" saith the hermit.
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir," saith Lancelot, "Whereof is right great joy.  And
 wherefore do you ask me?"
 </p><p>
 "Well ought I to ask it," saith the hermit, "For my father is
 King Pelles, and his mother is my father's own sister."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir, then is the King Hermit your father?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir, certes."
 </p><p>
 "Thereof do I love you the better," saith Lancelot, "For never
 found I any man that hath done me so much of love as hath he. 
 And what, Sir, is your name?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "My name is Joseus, and yours, what?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "I am called Lancelot of the Lake."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "Right close are we akin, I and you."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "Hereof am I right glad at heart." 
 </p><p>
 Lancelot looketh and seeth in the hermit's house shield and
 spear, javelins and habergeon. "Sir," saith Lancelot, "What do
 you with these arms?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "this forest is right lonely", and this
 hermitage is far from any folk, and none are there here-within
 save me and my squire.  So, when robbers come hither, we defend
 ourselves therewith."
 </p><p>
 "But hermits, methought, never assaulted nor wounded nor slew."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "God forbid I should wound any man or
 slay!"
 </p><p>
 "And how, then, do you defend yourselves?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I will tell you thereof.  When robbers come to us, we arm
 ourselves accordingly.  If I may catch hold of any in my hands,
 he cannot escape me.  Our squire is so well-grown and hardy that
 he slayeth him forthwith or handleth him in such sort that he may
 never help himself after."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "Were you not hermit, you would be
 valiant throughout."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the squire. "You say true, for methinketh
 there is none so strong nor so hardy as he in all the kingdom of
 Logres."
 </p><p>
 The lodged Lancelot the night the best he could.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 When as they were in their first sleep, come four robber-knights
 of the forest that knew how a knight was lodged therewithin, and
 had coveted his horse and his arms.  The hermit that was in his
 chapel saw them first, and awoke his squire and made him bring
 his arms all secretly; then he made his squire arm.  "Sir," saith
 the squire, "Shall I waken the knight?"
 </p><p>
 "In nowise," saith the hermit, "until such time as we shall know
 wherefore."
 </p><p>
 He maketh open the door of the chapel and taketh a great coil of
 rope, and they issue forth, he and his squire, and they perceived
 the robbers in the stable where Lancelot's horse was.  The hermit
 crieth out: the squire cometh forward and thereupon beareth one
 to the ground with his spear.  The hermit seizeth him and bindeth
 him to a tree so strait that he may not move.  The other three
 think to defend them and to rescue their fellow.  Lancelot
 leapeth up all startled when he heareth the noise and armeth
 himself as quickly as he may, albeit not so quickly but that or
 ever he come, the hermit hath taken the other three and bound
 them with the fourth.  But of them were some that were wounded
 right sore.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit to Lancelot, "It grieveth me that you
 have been awakened."
 </p><p>
 "Rather," saith Lancelot, "have you done me great wrong for that
 you ought to have awakened me sooner."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "We have assaults such as this often
 enough."
 </p><p>
 The four robbers cry mercy of Lancelot that he will pray the
 hermit to have pity upon them.  And Lancelot saith God help not
 him that shall have pity on thieves!  As soon as it was daylight,
 Lancelot and the squire led them into the forest, their hands all
 tied behind their backs, and have hanged them in a waste place
 far away from the hermitage.  Lancelot cometh back again and
 taketh leave of Joseus the young hermit, and saith it is great
 loss to the world that he is not knight.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the squire, "to me is it great joy, for many a man
 should suffer thereby."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot is mounted, and Joseus commendeth him to God, praying
 him much that he salute his father and cousin on his behalf, and
 Messire Gawain likewise that he met in the forest what time he
 came all weeping to the hermitage.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot hath set him forth again upon his way, and rideth by the
 high forests and findeth holds and hermitages enough, but the
 story maketh not remembrance of all the hostels wherein he
 harboured him.  So far hath he ridden that he is come forth of
 the forest and findeth a right fair meadow-land all loaded with
 flowers, and a river ran in the midst there of that was right
 fair and broad, and there was forest upon the one side and the
 other, and the meadow lands were wide and far betwixt the river
 and the forest.  Lancelot looketh on the river before him and
 seeth a man rowing a great boat, and seeth within the boat two
 knights, white and bald, and a damsel, as it seemed him, that
 held in her lap the head of a knight that lay upon a mattress of
 straw and was covered with a coverlid of marten's fur, and
 another damsel sate at his feet.  There was a knight within in
 the midst of the boat that was fishing with an angle, the rod
 whereof seemeth of gold, and right great fish he took.  A little
 cock-boat followed the boat, wherein he set the fish he took.
 Lancelot cometh anigh the bank the swiftest he may, and so
 saluteth the knights and damsels, and they return his salute
 right sweetly.
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith Lancelot, "is there no castle nigh at hand nor no
 harbour?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir," say they, "Beyond that mountain, right fair and rich,
 and this river runneth thither all round about it."
 </p><p>
 "Lords, whose castle is it?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they, "It is King Fisherman's, and the good knights
 lodge there when he is in this country; but such knights have
 been harboured there as that the lord of the land hath had good
 right to plain him thereof."
 </p><p>
 The knights go rowing along the river, and Lancelot rideth until
 he cometh to the foot of the mountain and findeth a hermitage
 beside a spring, and bethinketh him, since it behoveth him to go
 to so high a hostel and so rich, where the Holy Graal appeareth,
 he will confess him to the good man.  He alighteth and confesseth
 to the good man, and rehearseth all his sins, and saith that of
 all thereof doth he repent him save only one, and the hermit
 asketh him what it is whereof he is unwilling to repent.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "it seemeth to me the fairest sin and the
 sweetest that ever I committed."
 </p><p>
 "Fair Sir," saith the hermit, "Sin is sweet to do, but right
 bitter be the wages thereof; neither is there any sin that is
 fair nor seemly, albeit there be some sins more dreadfuller than
 other."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "this sin will I reveal to you of my lips,
 but of my heart may I never repent me thereof.  I love my Lady,
 which is the Queen, more than aught else that liveth, and albeit
 one of the best Kings on live hath her to wife.  The affection
 seemeth me so good and so high that I cannot let go thereof, for,
 so rooted is it in my heart that thence may it nevermore depart,
 and the best knighthood that is in me cometh to me only of her
 affection."
 </p><p>
 "Alas!" saith the hermit, "Sinner of mortal sin, what is this
 that you have spoken?  Never may no knighthood come of such
 wantonness that shall not cost you right dear!  A traitor are you
 toward our earthly lord, and a murderer toward Our Saviour.  Of
 the seven deadly sins, you are labouring under the one whereof
 the delights are the falsest of any, wherefore dearly shall you
 aby thereof, save you repent you forthwith."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "never the more do I desire to cast it
 from me."
 </p><p>
 "As much," saith the hermit, "is that as to say that you ought
 long since to have cast it from you and renounced it.  For so
 long as you maintain it, so long are you an enemy of the
 Saviour!"
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir," saith Lancelot, "She hath in her such beauty and worth
 and wisdom and courtesy and nobleness that never ought she to be
 forgotten of any that hath loved her!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 "The more of beauty and worth she hath in her," saith the hermit,
 "so much the more blame hath she of that she doeth, and you
 likewise.  For of that which is of little worth is the loss not
 so great as of that which is much worth.  And this is a Queen,
 blessed and anointed, that was thus, therefore, in her beginning
 vowed to God; yet now is she given over to the Devil of her love
 for you, and you of your love for her.  Fair, sweet my friend,"
 saith the hermit, "Let go this folly, which is so cruel, that you
 have taken in hand, and be repentant of these sins!  So every day
 will I pray to the Saviour for you, that so truly as He pardoned
 His death to him that smote Him with a lance in His side, so may
 He pardon you of this sin that you have maintained, and that so
 you be repentant and truly confessed thereof, I may take the
 penance due thereunto upon myself!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "I thank you much, but I am not minded to
 renounce it, nor have I no wish to speak aught wherewith my heart
 accordeth not.  I am willing enough to do penance as great as is
 enjoined of this sin, but my lady the Queen will I serve so long
 as it may be her pleasure, and I may have her good will.  So
 dearly do I love her that I wish not even that any will should
 come to me to renounce her love, and God is so sweet and so full
 of right merciful mildness, as good men bear witness, that He
 will have pity upon us, for never no treason have I done toward
 her, nor she toward me."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, fair sweet friend," saith the hermit, "Nought may you avail
 you of whatsoever I may say, wherefore God grant her such will
 and you also, that you may be able to do the will of Our Saviour.
 But so much am I fain to tell you, that and if you shall lie in
 the hostel of King Fisherman, yet never may you behold the Graal
 for the mortal sin that lieth at your heart."
 </p><p>
 "May our Lord God," saith Lancelot, "counsel me therein at His
 pleasure and at His will!"
 </p><p>
 "So may He do!" saith the hermit, "For of a truth you may know
 thereof am I right fain."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot taketh leave of the hermit, and is mounted forthwith and
 departeth from the hermitage.  And evening draweth on, and he
 seeth that it is time to lodge him.  And he espieth before him
 the castle of the rich King Fisherman.  He seeth the bridges,
 broad and long, but they seem not to him the same as they had
 seemed to Messire Gawain.  He beholdeth the rich entrance of the
 gateway there where Our Lord God was figured as He was set upon
 the rood, and seeth two lions that guard the entrance of the
 gate.  Lancelot thinketh that sith Messire Gawain had passed
 through amidst the lions, he would do likewise.  He goeth toward
 the gateway, and the lions that were unchained prick up their
 ears and look at him.  Howbeit Lancelot goeth his way between
 them without heeding them, and neither of them was fain to do him
 any hurt.  He alighteth before the master-palace, and mounteth
 upward all armed.  Two other knights come to meet him and receive
 him with right great joy, then they make him be seated on a couch
 in the midst of the hall and be disarmed of two servants.  Two
 damsels bring him a right rich robe and make him be apparelled
 therewithal.  Lancelot beholdeth the richness of the hall and
 seeth nought figured there save images of saints, men or women,
 and he seeth the hall hung about with cloths of silk in many
 places.  The knights lead him before King Fisherman in a chamber
 where he lay right richly.  He findeth the King, that lieth on a
 bed so rich and so fair apparelled as never was seen a better,
 and one damsel was at his head and another at his feet.  Lancelot
 saluteth him right nobly, and the King answereth him full fairly
 as one that is a right worshipful man.  And such a brightness of
 light was there in the chamber as that it seemed the sun were
 beaming on all sides, and albeit the night was dark, no candles,
 so far as Lancelot might espy, were lighted therewithin.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith King Fisherman, "Can you tell me tidings of my
 sister's son, that was son of Alain li Gros of the Valleys of
 Camelot, whom they call Perceval?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "I saw him not long time sithence in the
 house of King Hermit, his uncle."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the King, "They tell me he is a right good knight?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "He is the best knight of the world.  I
 myself have felt the goodness of his knighthood and his valour,
 for right sorely did he wound me or ever I knew him or he me."
 </p><p>
 "And what is your name?" saith the King.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I am called Lancelot of the Lake, King Ban's son of
 Benoic."
 </p><p>
 "Ha," saith the King, "you are nigh of our lineage, you ought to
 be good knight of right, and so are you as I have heard witness,
 Lancelot," saith the King.  "Behold there the chapel where the
 most Holy Graal taketh his rest, that appeared to two knights
 that have been herewithin.  I know not what was the name of the
 first, but never saw I any so gentle and quiet, nor had better
 likelihood to be good knight.  It was through him that I have
 fallen into languishment.  The second was Messire Gawain."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "the first was Perceval your nephew."
 </p><p>
 "Ha!" saith King Fisherman, "take heed that you speak true!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "I ought to know him well!"
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God!" saith the King, "Wherefore then did I know him not?
 Through him have I fallen into this languishment, and had I only
 known then that it was he, should I now be all whole of my limbs
 and of my body, and right instantly do I pray you, when you shall
 see him, that he come to see me or ever I die, and that he be
 fain to succour and help his mother, whose men have been slain,
 and whose land hath been reaved in such sort that never may she
 have it again save by him alone.  And his sister hath gone in
 quest of him throughout all kingdoms."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "This will I tell him gladly, if ever I
 may find him in any place, but it is great adventure of finding
 him, for oft-times will he change his cognizance in divers
 fashion and conceal his name in many places."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII.
 </p><p>
 King Fisherman is right joyous of the tidings he hath heard of
 his nephew, wherefore he maketh Lancelot be honoured greatly. 
 The knights seat them in the hall at a table of ivory at meat,
 and the King remaineth in his chamber.  When they had washen, the
 table was dight of rich sets of vessels of gold and silver, and
 they were served of rich meats of venison of hart and wild boar.
 But the story witnesseth that the Graal appeared not at this
 feast.  It held not aloof for that Lancelot was not one of the
 three knights of the world of the most renown and mightiest
 valour, but for his great sin as touching the Queen, whom he
 loved without repenting him thereof, for of nought did he think
 so much as of her, nor never might he remove his heart therefrom.
 When they had eaten they rose from the tables.  Two damsels
 waited on Lancelot at his going to bed, and he lay on a right
 rich couch, nor were they willing to depart until such time as he
 was asleep.  He rose on the morrow as soon as he saw the day, and
 went to hear mass.  Then he took leave of King Fisherman and the
 knights and damsels, and issued forth of the castle between the
 two lions, and prayeth God that He allow him to see the Queen
 again betimes, for this is his most desire.  He rideth until he
 hath left the castle far behind and entereth the forest, and is
 in right great desire to see Perceval, but the tidings of him
 were right far away.  He looketh before him in the forest and
 seeth come right amidst the launde a knight, and a damsel clad in
 the richest robe of gold and silk that ever he had seen tofore.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIII.
 </p><p>
 The damsel came weeping by the side of the knight and prayed him
 oftentimes that he would have mercy upon her.  The knight is
 still and holdeth his peace, and saith never a word.
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Sir," saith the damsel to Lancelot, "Be pleased to beseech
 this knight on my behalf."
 </p><p>
 "In what manner?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I will tell you.  He hath shown me semblance
 of love for more than a year, and had me in covenant that he
 would take me to wife, and I apparelled myself in the richest
 garments that I had to come to him.  But my father is of greater
 power and riches than is he, and therefore was not willing to
 allow the marriage.  Wherefore come I with him in this manner,
 for I love him better than ever another knight beside.  Now will
 he do nought of that he had me in covenant to do, for he loveth
 another, better, methinketh, than me.  And this hath he done, as
 I surmise, to do shame to my friends and to me."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot seeth the damsel of right great beauty and weeping
 tenderly, whereof hath he passing great pity.
 </p><p>
 "Hold, Sir!" saith Lancelot to the knight, "this shall you not
 do!  You shall not do such shame to so fair a damsel as that you
 shall fail to keep covenant with her.  For not a knight is there
 in the kingdom of Logres nor in that of Wales but ought to be
 right well pleased to have so fair a damsel to wife, and I pray
 and require that you do to the damsel that whereof you held her
 in covenant.  This will be a right worshipful deed, and I pray
 and beseech that you do it, and thereof shall I be much beholden
 unto you."
 </p><p>
 "Sir, saith the knight, "I have no will thereunto, nor for no man
 will I do it, for ill would it beseem me."
 </p><p>
 "By my head, then," saith Lancelot, "the basest knight are you
 that ever have I seen, nor ought dame nor damsel ever hereafter
 put trust in you, sith that you are minded to put such disgrace
 upon this lady."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "a worthier lover have I than this, and
 one that I more value; wherefore as touching this damsel will I
 do nought more than I have said."
 </p><p>
 "And whither, then, mean you to take her?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "I mean to take her to a hold of mine own that is in this forest,
 and to give her in charge to a dwarf of mine that looketh after
 my house, and I will marry her to some knight or some other man."
 </p><p>
 "Now never God help me," saith Lancelot, "but this is foul
 churlishness you tell me, and, so you do not her will, it shall
 betide you ill of me myself, and, had you been armed as I am, you
 should have felt my first onset already."
 </p><p>
 "Ha," saith the damsel to Lancelot, "Be not so ready to do him
 any hurt, for nought love I so well as I love his body,
 whatsoever he do unto me.  But for God's sake pray him that he do
 me the honour he hath promised me."
 </p><p>
 "Willingly," saith Lancelot.  "Sir Knight, will you do this
 whereof you had the damsel in covenant?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "I have told you plainly that I will
 not."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith Lancelot, "you shall do it, or otherwise
 sentence of death hath passed upon you, and this not so much for
 the sake of the damsel only, but for the churlishness that hath
 taken possession of you, that it be not a reproach to other
 knights.  For promise that knight maketh to dame or damsel
 behoveth him to keep.  And you, as you tell me, are knight, and
 no knight ought to do churlishly to his knowledge, and this
 churlishness is so far greater than another, that for no prayer
 that the damsel may make will I suffer that it shall be done, but
 that if you do not that whereof you held her in covenant, I shall
 slay you, for that I will not have this churlishness made a
 reproach unto other knights."
 </p><p>
 He draweth his sword and would have come toward him, when the
 knight cometh over against him and saith to him: "Slay me not.
 Tell me rather what you would have me do?"
 </p><p>
 "I would," saith he, "that you take the damsel to wife without
 denial."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "it pleaseth me better to take her than to die.
 Sir, I will do your will."
 </p><p>
 "I thank you much therefor," saith Lancelot. "Damsel, is this
 your pleasure also?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Sir, but, so please you, take not your departure from us
 until such time as he shall have done that which you tell him."
 </p><p>
 "I will, well that so it be," saith Lancelot, "for love of you." 
 </p><p>
 They ride together right through the forest, until they came to a
 chapel at a hermitage, and the hermit wedded them and made much
 joy thereof.  When it cometh to after-mass, Lancelot would fain
 depart, but the damsel prayeth him right sweetly that he should
 come right to her father's house to witness that the knight had
 wedded her.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIV.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "My father's hold is not far away."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Lancelot, "Willingly will I go sith that you
 beseech me thereof."
 </p><p>
 They ride so long right amidst the forest, that presently they
 come to the castle of the Vavasour, that was sitting on the
 bridge of his castle, right sorrowful and troubled because of his
 daughter.  Lancelot is gone on before and alighteth.  The
 Vavasour riseth up to meet him, and Lancelot recounteth unto him
 how his daughter hath been wedded, and that he hath been at the
 wedding.  Thereof the Vavasour maketh right great joy.
 Therewithal, behold you, the knight and the Vavasour"s daughter
 that are straightway alighted, and the Vavasour thanketh Lancelot
 much of the honour he hath done his daughter.  Therewith he
 departeth from the castle and rideth amidst the forest the day
 long, and meeteth a damsel and a dwarf that came a great gallop. 
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel to Lancelot, "From whence come you?"
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "I come from the Vavasour's castle that is in
 this forest."
 </p><p>
 "Did you meet," saith she, "a knight and a damsel on your way?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea," saith Lancelot, "He hath wedded her."
 </p><p>
 "Say you true?" saith she.
 </p><p>
 "I tell you true," saith Lancelot, "But had I not been there, he
 would not have wedded her."
 </p><p>
 "Shame and ill adventure may you have thereof, for you have reft
 me of the thing in the world that most I loved.  And know you
 well of a truth that joy of him shall she never have, and if the
 knight had been armed as are you, never would he have done your
 will, but his own.  And this is not the first harm you have done
 me; you and Messire Gawain between you have slain my uncle and my
 two cousins-german in the forest, whom behoved me bury in the
 chapel where you were, there where my dwarf that you see here was
 making the graves in the burial-ground."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Lancelot, "true it is that I was there, but I
 departed from the grave-yard, honour safe."
 </p><p>
 "True," saith the dwarf, "For the knights that were there were
 craven, and failed."
 </p><p>
 "Fair friend," saith Lancelot, "Rather would I they should be
 coward toward me than hardy."
 </p><p>
 "Lancelot," saith the damsel, "Much outrage have you done, for
 you slew the Knight of the Waste House, there whither the brachet
 led Messire Gawain, but had he there been known, he would not
 have departed so soon, for he was scarce better loved than you,
 and God grant you may find a knight that may abate the outrages
 that are in your heart and in his; for great rejoicing would
 there be thereof, for many a good knight have you slain, and I
 myself will bring about trouble for you, so quickly as I may."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XV.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon the dwarf smiteth the mule with his whip, and she
 departeth.  Lancelot would answer none of her reviling, wherefore
 he departed forthwith, and rideth so long on his journeys that he
 is come back to the house of the good King Hermit, that maketh
 right great joy of him.  And he telleth him that he hath been
 unto the house of King Fisherman, his brother that lieth in
 languishment, and telleth him also how he hath been honoured in
 his hostel, and of the salutations that he sent him.  King Hermit
 is right joyous thereof, and asketh him of his nephew, and he
 telleth him he hath seen him not since he departed thence.  King
 Hermit asketh him whether he hath seen the Graal, and he telleth
 him he hath seen it not at all.
 </p><p>
 "I know well," saith the King, "wherefore this was so.  And you
 had had the like desire to see the Graal that you have to see the
 Queen, the Graal would you have seen."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "The Queen do I desire to see for the sake
 of her good intent, her wisdom, courtesy and worth, and so ought
 every knight to do.  For in herself hath she all honourable
 conditions that a lady may have."
 </p><p>
 "God grant you good issue therein," saith King Hermit, "and that
 you do nought whereof He may visit you with His wrath at the Day
 of Judgment."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot lay the night in the hermitage, and on the morrow
 departed thence and took leave when he had heard mass, and cometh
 back as straight as he may to Pannenoisance on the sea of Wales,
 where were the King and Queen with great plenty of knights and
 barons.
