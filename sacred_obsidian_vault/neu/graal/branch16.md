 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XVI</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 This High History saith that Messire Gawain and Lancelot were
 repaired to the court of King Arthur from the quest they had
 achieved.  The King made great joy thereof and the Queen.  King
 Arthur sate one day at meat by the side of the Queen, and they
 had been served of the first meats.  Thereupon come two knights
 all armed, and each bore a dead knight before him, and the
 knights were still armed as they had been when their bodies were
 alive.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say the knights, "This shame and this mischief is yours.
 In like manner will you lose all your knights betimes and God
 love you not well enough to give counsel herein forthwith of his
 mercy."
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith the King, "How came these knights to be in so evil
 case?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say they, "It is of good right you ought to know.  The
 Knight of the Fiery Dragon is entered into the head of your land,
 and is destroying knights and castles and whatsoever he may lay
 hands on, in such sort that none durst contend against him, for
 he is taller by a foot than any knight ever you had, and of
 grisly cheer, and so is his sword three times bigger than the
 sword of ever another knight, and his spear is well as heavy as a
 man may carry.  Two knights might lightly cover them of his
 shield, and it hath on the outer side the head of a dragon that
 casteth forth fire and flame whensoever he will, so eager and
 biting that none may long endure his encounter."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>

 </p><p>
 "None other, how strong soever he be, may stand against him, and,
 even as you see, hath he burnt and evil-entreated all other
 knights that have withstood him."
 </p><p>
 "From what land hath come such manner of man?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," say the knights, "He is come from the Giant's castle, and
 he warreth upon you for the love of Logrin the Giant, whose head
 Messire Kay brought you into your court, nor never, saith he,
 will he have joy until such time as he shall have avenged him on
 your body or upon the knight that you love best."
 </p><p>
 "Our Lord God," saith the King, "Will defend us from so evil a
 man."
 </p><p>
 He is risen from the table, all scared, and maketh carry the two
 dead knights to be buried, and the others turn back again when
 they have told their message.  The King calleth Messire Gawain
 and Lancelot and asketh them what he shall do of this knight that
 is entered into his land?
 </p><p>
 "By my head, I know not what to say, save you give counsel
 herein."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "We will go against him, so please you, I
 and Messire Gawain between us."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the King, "I would not let you go for a
 kingdom, for such man as is this is no knight but a devil and a
 fiend that hath issued from the borders of Hell.  I say not but
 that it were great worship and prize to slay and conquer him, but
 he that should go against him should set his own life in right
 sore jeopardy and run great hazard of being in as bad plight as
 these two knights I have seen."
 </p><p>
 The King was in such dismay that he knew not neither what to say
 nor to do, and so was all the court likewise in such sort as no
 knight neither one nor another was minded to go to battle with
 him, and so remained the court in great dismay.
