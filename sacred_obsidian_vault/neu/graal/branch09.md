 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch IX</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Now the story is silent about the two knights for a little time,
 and speaketh of the squire that Messire Gawain meeteth in the
 midst of the forest, that told him he went seek the son of the
 Widow Lady that had slain his father.  And the squire saith that
 he will go to avenge him, wherefore cometh he to the court of
 King Arthur, for that he had heard tell how all good knights
 repaired thither.  And he seeth the shield hang on the column in
 the midst of the hall that the Damsel of the Car had brought
 thither.  The squire knoweth it well, and kneeleth before the
 King and saluteth him, and the King returneth his salute and
 asketh who he is.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "I am the son of the Knight of the Red Shield of
 the Forest of Shadows, that was slain of the Knight that ought to
 bear the shield that hangeth on this column, wherefore would I
 right gladly hear tidings of him."
 </p><p>
 "As gladly would I," saith the King, "so that no evil came to him
 thereof, for he is the knight of the world that I most desire."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Squire, "Well behoveth me to hate him for that
 he slew my father.  He that ought to bear this shield was squire
 when he slew him, wherefore am I the more sorrowful for that I
 thought to be avenged upon him squire.  But this I may not do,
 wherefore I pray you for God's sake that you will make me knight,
 for the like favour are you accustomed to grant unto others."
 </p><p>
 "What is your name, fair friend?" saith the King.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he, "I am called Clamados of the Shadows."
 </p><p>
 Messire Gawain that had repaired to court, was in the hall, and
 said to the King: "If this squire be enemy of the Good Knight
 that ought to bear this shield, behoveth you not set forward his
 mortal enemy but rather set him back, for he is the Best Knight
 of the world and the most chaste that liveth in the world and of
 the most holy lineage, and therefore have you sojourned right
 long time in this castle to await his coming.  I say not this for
 the hindering of the squire's advancement, but that you may do
 nought whereof the Good Knight may have cause of complaint
 against you."
 </p><p>
 "Messire Gawain," saith Queen Guenievre, "well know I that you
 love my Lord's honour, but sore blame will he have if he make not
 this one knight, for so much hath he never refused to do for any;
 nor yet will the Good Knight have any misliking thereof, for
 greater shame should he have, and greater despite of the hatred
 of a squire than of a knight; for never yet was good knight that
 was not prudent and well-advised and slow to take offence.
 Wherefore I tell you that he will assuredly listen to reason, and
 I commend my Lord the rather that he make him knight, for much
 blame would he have of gainsaying him."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Messire Gawain, "So you are content, I am happy."
 </p><p>
 The King made him knight right richly, and when he was clad in
 the robes, they of the court declare and witness that never this
 long time past had they seen at the court knight of greater
 comeliness.  He sojourned therein long time, and , was much
 honoured of the King and all the barons.  He was every day on the
 watch for the Good Knight that should come for the shield, but
 the hour and the place were not as yet.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 When he saw that he did not come, he took leave of the King and
 the Queen and all them of the court, and departed, thinking him
 that he would go prove his knighthood in some place until he
 should have heard tidings of his mortal enemy.  He rideth amidst
 the great forests bearing a red shield like as did his father,
 and he was all armed as for defending of his body.  And a long
 space of time he rideth, until one day he cometh to the head of a
 forest, and he espied his way that ran between two mountains and
 saw that he had to pass along the midst of the valley that lay at
 a great depth.  He looketh before him and seeth a tree far away
 from him, and underneath were three damsels alighted, and one
 prayed God right heartily aloud that He would send them betimes a
 knight that durst convoy them through this strait pass.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 Clamodos heareth the damsel and cometh thitherward.  When they
 espied him, great joy have they thereof and rise up to meet him. 
 "Sir, say they, "Welcome may you be!"
 </p><p>
 "Damsels," saith he, "Good adventure may you have!  And whom
 await you here?" saith he.
 </p><p>
 "We await," saith the Mistress of the damsels, "some knight that
 shall clear this pass, for no knight durst pass hereby."
 </p><p>
 "What is the pass; then, damsel?" saith he.
 </p><p>
 "It is the one of a lion, and a lion, moreover, so fell and
 horrible that never was none seen more cruel.  And there is a
 knight with the lion between the two mountains that is right good
 knight and hardy and comely.  Howbeit none durst pass without
 great company of folk.  But the knight that hath repair with the
 lion is seldom there, for so he were there we need fear no
 danger, for much courtesy is there in him and valour."
 </p><p>
 And the knight looketh and seeth in the shadow of the forest
 three fair stags harnessed to a car.
 </p><p>
 "Ha," saith he, "you are the Damsel of the Car, wherefore may you
 well tell me tidings of the knight of whom I am in quest."
 </p><p>
 "Who is he?" saith the Damsel.
 </p><p>
 "It is he that should bear a shield banded argent and azure with
 a red cross."
 </p><p>
 "Of him am I likewise in quest," saith the Damsel; "please God,
 we shall hear tidings of him betimes."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel" saith the knight, "that would I.  And for that you are
 in quest of him as am I likewise, I will convoy you beyond this
 pass."
 </p><p>
 The Damsel maketh her Car go on before, and the damsels go before
 the knight; and so enter they into the field of the lion, and
 right fair land found they therewithin.  Clamados looketh and
 seeth the hall within an enclosure and seeth the lion that lay at
 the entrance of the gateway.  As soon as he espieth Clamados and
 the damsels, he cometh toward them full speed, mouth open and
 ears pricked up.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Damsel, "and you defend not your horse on foot,
 he is dead at the first onset."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Clamados is alighted to his feet, by her counsel, and holdeth his
 spear in his fist, and the lion rampeth toward him all in a fury.
 Clamados receiveth him on the point of his spear, and smiteth him
 therewith so stoutly that it passeth a fathom beyond his neck. 
 He draweth back his spear without breaking it, and thinketh to
 smite him again.  But the lion cheateth him, and arising himself
 on his two hinder feet, setteth his fore feet on his shoulders,
 then huggeth him toward him like as one man doth another.  But
 the grip was sore grievous, for he rendeth his habergeon in twain
 and so teareth away as much flesh as he can claw hold on.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 When Clamados felt himself wounded, he redoubled his hardihood,
 and grippeth the lion so straitly to him that he wringeth a huge
 roar out of him, and then flingeth him to the ground beneath him.
 Then he draweth his sword and thrusteth it to the heart right
 through the breast.  The lion roareth so loud that all the
 mountains resound thereof.  Clamados cutteth off his head and
 goeth to hang it at the door of the hall.  Then he cometh back to
 his horse and mounteth the best he may.  And the Damsel saith to
 him, "Sir, you are sore wounded."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," said he, "please God, I shall take no hurt thereof." 
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you a squire that issueth forth of the hall and
 cometh after him full speed.  "Hold, Sir Knight," saith he; "Foul
 wrong have you wrought, for you have slain the lion of the most
 courteous knight that may be known, and the fairest and most
 valiant of this kingdom, and in his despite have you hung the
 head at his door!  Right passing great outrage have you done
 hereby!"
 </p><p>
 "Fair sweet friend," saith Clamados, "it may well be that the
 lord is right courteous, but the lion was rascal and would have
 slain me and them that were passing by.  And your lord loved him
 so much he should have chained him up, for better liketh me that
 I slew him than that he should slay me."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the squire, "there is no road this way, for it is a
 forbidden land whereof certain would fain reave my lord, and it
 was against the coming of his enemies that the lion was allowed
 forth unchained."
 </p><p>
 "And what name hath your lord, fair friend?" saith Clamados. 
 </p><p>
 "Sir, he is called Meliot of Logres, and he is gone in quest of
 Messire Gawain, of whom he holdeth the land, for right dear is
 he to him."
 </p><p>
 "Messire Gawain," saith Clamados, "left I at the court of King
 Arthur, but behoveth him depart thence or ever I return thither."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the squire, "faith would I you might meet
 them both twain, if only my lord knew that you had slain him his
 lion."
 </p><p>
 "Fair friend," saith Clamados, "and he be as courteous as you
 say, no misliking will he have of me thereof, for I slew him in
 defending mine own body, and God forbid I should meet any that
 would do me evil therefor."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon the knight and the damsels depart and pass the narrow
 strait in the lion's field, and ride on until they draw nigh a
 right rich castle seated in a meadowland surrounded of great
 waters and high forests, and the castle was always void of folk.
 And they were fain to turn thitherward, but they met a squire
 that told them that in the castle was not a soul, albeit and they
 would ride forward they would find great plenty of folk.  So far
 forward have they ridden that they are come to the head of a
 forest and see great foison of tents stretched right in the midst
 of a launde, and they were compassed round of a great white sheet
 that seemed from afar to be a long white wall with crenels, and
 it was a good league Welsh in length.  They came to the entrance
 of the tents and heard great joy within, and when they had
 entered they saw dames and damsels, whereof was great plenty, and
 of right passing great beauty were they.  Clamados alighteth,
 that was right sore wounded.  The Damsel of the Car was received
 with right great joy.  Two of the damsels come to Clamados, of
 whom make they right great joy.  Afterward they lead him to a
 tent and made disarm him.  Then they washed his wounds right
 sweetly and tenderly.  Then they brought him a right rich robe
 and made him be apparelled therein, and led him before the ladies
 of the tents, that made right great joy of him.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith the Damsel of the Car, "This knight hath saved my
 life, for he hath slain the lion on account of which many folk
 durst not come to you, wherefore make great joy of him."
 </p><p>
 "Greater joy may I not make, than I do, nor the damsels that are
 herein, for we await the coming of the Good Knight that is
 healed, from day to day.  And now is there nought in the world I
 more desire to see."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Clamados, "Who is this Good Knight?"
 </p><p>
 "The son of the Widow Lady of the Valleys of Camelot," saith she.
 </p><p>
 "Tell me, Lady, do you say that he will come hither presently?"
 </p><p>
 "So methinketh," saith she.
 </p><p>
 "Lady, I also shall have great joy thereof, and God grant he come
 betimes!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir Knight," saith she, "What is your name?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady" saith he, "I am called Clamados, and I am son of the lord
 of the Forest of Shadows."
 </p><p>
 She throweth her arms on his neck and kisseth and embraceth him
 right sweetly, and saith: "Marvel not that I make you joy
 thereof, for you are the son of my sister-in-law, nor have I any
 friend nor blood-kindred so nigh as are you, and fain would I you
 should be lord of all my land and of me, as is right and reason."
 </p><p>
 The damsels of the tents make right great joy of him when they
 know the tidings that he is so nigh of kin to the Lady of the
 Tents.  And he sojourned therewithin until that he was whole and
 heal, awaiting the coming of the knight of whom he had heard the
 tidings.  And the damsels marvel them much that he cometh not,
 for the damsel that had tended him was therewithin and telleth
 them that he was healed of his arm, but that Lancelot is not yet
 whole, wherefore he is still within the hermitage.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VIII.
 </p><p>
 This high history witnesseth us and recordeth that Joseph, who
 maketh remembrance thereof, was the first priest that sacrificed
 the body of Our Lord, and forsomuch ought one to believe the
 words that come of him.  You have heard tell how Perceval was of
 the lineage of Joseph of Abarimacie, whom God so greatly loved
 for that he took down His body hanging on the cross, which he
 would not should lie in the prison there where Pilate had set it.
 For the highness of the lineage whereof the Good Knight was
 descended ought one willingly to hear brought to mind and
 recorded the words that are of him.  The story telleth us that he
 was departed of the hermitage all sound and whole, albeit he hath
 left Lancelot, for that his wound was not yet healed, but he hath
 promised him that he will come back to him so soon as he may.  He
 rideth amidst a forest, all armed, and cometh toward evensong to
 the issue of the forest and seeth a castle before him right fair
 and well seated, and goeth thitherward for lodging, for the sun
 was set.  He entereth into the castle and alighteth.  The lord
 cometh to meet him that was a tall knight and a red, and had a
 felon look, and his face scarred in many places; and knight was
 there none therewithin save only himself and his household.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX.
 </p><p>
 When he seeth Perceval alighted, he runneth to bar the door, and
 Perceval cometh over against him.  For all greeting, the knight
 saluteth him thus: "Now shall you have," saith he, "such guerdon
 as you have deserved.  Never again shall you depart hence, for my
 mortal enemy are you, and right hardy are you thus to throw
 yourself upon me, for you slew my brother the Lord of the
 Shadows, and Chaos the Red am I that war upon your mother, and
 this castle have I reft of her.  In like manner will I wring the
 life out of you or ever you depart hence!"
 </p><p>
 "Already," saith Perceval, "have I thrown myself on this your
 hostel to lodge with you, wherefore to blame would you be to do
 me evil.  But lodge me this night as behoveth one knight do for
 another, and on the morrow at departing let each do the best he
 may."
 </p><p>
 "By my head!" saith Chaos the Red, "mortal enemy of mine will I
 never harbour here save I harbour him dead."
 </p><p>
 He runneth to the hall above, and armeth himself as swiftly as he
 may, and taketh his sword all naked in his hand and cometh back
 to the place where Perceval was, right full of anguish of heart
 for this that he said, that he would war upon his mother and had
 reft her of this castle.  He flung his spear to the ground, and
 goeth toward him on foot and dealeth him a huge buffet above the
 helmet upon the coif of his habergeon, such that he cleaveth the
 mail and cutteth off two fingers'-breadth of the flesh in such
 sort that he made him reel three times round.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X.
 </p><p>
 When Chaos the Red felt himself wounded, he was sore grieved
 thereof, and cometh toward Perceval and striketh him a great
 buffet above in the midst of his helmet, so that he made the
 sparks fly and his neck stoop and his eyes sparkle of stars.  And
 the blow slippeth down on to the shield, so that it is cleft
 right down to the boss.  Perceval felt his neck stiff and heavy,
 and feeleth that the knight is sturdy and of great might.  He
 cometh back towards him, and thinketh to strike him above in the
 midst of his head, but Chaos swerved aside from him; howbeit
 Perceval reached him and caught his right arm and cutteth it
 sheer from his side, sword and all, and sendeth it flying to the
 ground, and Chaos runneth upon him, thinking to grapple him with
 his left arm, but his force was waning; nathless right gladly
 would he have avenged himself and he might.  Howbeit, Perceval
 setteth on him again that loved him not in his heart, and smiteth
 him again above on the head, and dealeth him such a buffet as
 maketh his brains be all to-scattered abroad.  His household and
 servants were at the windows of the hall.  When they see that
 their lord is nigh to the death, they cry to Perceval: "Sir, you
 have slain the hardiest knight in the kingdom of Logres, and him
 that was most redoubted of his enemies; but we can do no
 otherwise; we know well that this castle is your mother's and
 ought to be yours.  We challenge it not; wherefore may you do
 your will of whatsoever there is in the castle; but allow us to
 go to our lord that there lieth dead, and take away the body and
 set it in some seemly place for the sake of his good knighthood,
 and for that it behoveth us so to do."
 </p><p>
 "Readily do I grant it you," saith Perceval.
 </p><p>
 They bear the body to a chapel, then they disarm him and wind him
 in his shroud.  After that they lead Perceval into the hall and
 disarm him and say to him: "Sir, you may be well assured that
 there be none but us twain herewithin and two damsels, and the
 doors are barred, and behold, here are the keys which we deliver
 up to you."
 </p><p>
 "And I command you," saith Perceval, "that you go straightway to
 my mother, and tell her that she shall see me betimes and I may
 get done, and so salute her and tell her I am sound and whole.
 And what is the name of this castle?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, it hath for name the Key of Wales, for it is the gateway
 of the land."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI.
 </p><p>
 Perceval lay the night in the castle he had reconquered for his
 mother, and the morrow, when he was armed, he departed.  These
 promised that they would keep the castle loyally and would
 deliver it up to his mother at her will.  He rode until he came
 to the tents where the damsels were, and drew rein and listened.
 But there was not so great joy as when the damsel that rode like
 a knight and led the Car came thither with Clamados.  Great dole
 heard he that was made, and beating of palms.  Wherefore he
 bethought him what folk they might be.  Natheless he was not
 minded to draw back without entering.  He alighted in the midst
 of the tents and set down his shield and his spear, and seeth the
 damsels wringing their hands and tearing their hair, and much
 marvelleth he wherefore it may be.  A damsel cometh forward that
 had set forth from the castle where he had slain the knight:
 "Sir, to your shame and ill adventure may you have come hither!"
 </p><p>
 Perceval looketh at her and marvelleth much of that she saith,
 and she crieth out: "Lady, behold here him that hath slain the
 best knight of your lineage!  And you, Clamados, that are within
 there, he hath slain your father and your uncle!  Now shall it be
 seen what you will do!"
 </p><p>
 The Damsel of the Car cometh thitherward and knoweth Perceval by
 the shield that he bare of sinople with a white hart.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "welcome may you be!  Let who will make dole, I
 will make joy of your coming!"
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII.
 </p><p>
 Therewith the Damsel leadeth him into a tent and maketh him sit
 on a right rich couch; afterward she maketh him be disarmed of
 her two damsels and clad in a right rich robe.  Then she leadeth
 him to the Queen of the Tents that was still making great dole.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith the Damsel of the Car, "Stint your sorrow, for
 behold, here is the Good Knight on whose account were the tents
 here pitched, and on whose account no less have you been making
 this great joy right up to this very day!"
 </p><p>
 "Ha," saith she, "Is this then the son of the Widow Lady?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, certes," saith the Damsel.
 </p><p>
 "Ha," saith the Lady, "He hath slain me the best knight of all my
 kin, and the one that protected me from mine enemies."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith the Damsel, "this one will be better able to
 protect and defend us, for the Best Knight is he of the world and
 the comeliest."
 </p><p>
 The Queen taketh him by the hand and maketh him sit beside her.
 "Sir," saith she, "Howsoever the adventure may have befallen, my
 heart biddeth me make joy of your coming."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "Gramercy!  Chaos would fain have slain me
 within his castle, and I defended myself to my power."
 </p><p>
 The Queen looketh at him amidst his face, and is taken with a
 love of him so passing strong and fervent that she goeth nigh to
 fall upon him.  "Sir," saith she, "and you will grant me your
 love, I will pardon you of all the death of Chaos the Red."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "your love am I right fain to deserve, and mine
 you have."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "How may I perceive that you love me?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "I will tell you.  There is no knight in the
 world that shall desire to do you a wrong, but I will help you
 against him to my power."
 </p><p>
 "Such love," saith she, "is the common love that knight ought to
 bear to lady.  Would you do as much for another?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "It well may be, but more readily shall a man
 give help in one place than in another."
 </p><p>
 The Queen would fain that Perceval should pledge himself to her
 further than he did, and the more she looketh at him the better
 he pleaseth her, and the more is she taken with him and the more
 desirous of his love.  But Perceval never once thought of loving
 her or another in such wise.  He was glad to look upon her, for
 that she was of passing great beauty, but never spake he nought
 to her whereby she might perceive that he loved her of inward
 love.  But in no wise might she refrain her heart, nor withdraw
 her eyes, nor lose her desire.  The damsels looked upon her with
 wonder that so soon had she forgotten her mourning.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIII.
 </p><p>
 Thereupon, behold you Clamados, that had been told that this was
 the knight that, as yet only squire, had slain his father and put
 Chaos his uncle to death.  He cometh into the tent and seeth him
 sitting beside the Queen, that looked at him right sweetly.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "Great shame do you to yourself, in that you
 have seated at your side your own mortal enemy and mine.  Never
 again henceforth ought any to have affiance in your love nor in
 your help."
 </p><p>
 "Clamados," saith the Queen, "the knight hath thrown himself upon
 me suddenly.  Wherefore ought I do him no evil, rather behoveth
 me lodge him and keep his body in safety.  Nought, moreover, hath
 he done whereof he might be adjudged of murder nor of treason."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Clamados, "He slew my father in the Lonely Forest
 without defiance, and treacherously cast a javelin at him and
 smote him through the body, wherefore shall I never be at ease
 until I have avenged him.  Therefore do I appeal and pray you to
 do me my right, not as being of your kindred, but as stranger. 
 For right willing am I that kinship shall avail me nought
 herein."
 </p><p>
 Perceval looketh at the knight and seeth that he is of right
 goodly complexion of body and right comely of face.  "Fair Sir,"
 saith he, "as of treason I would that you hold me quit, for never
 toward your father nor toward other have had I never a mind to do
 treason, and God defend me from such shame, and grant me strength
 to clear myself of any blame thereof."
 </p><p>
 Clamados cometh forward to proffer his gage.
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the Queen, "not this day shall gage be
 received herein.  But to-morrow will come day, and counsel
 therewith, and then shall fight be done to each."
 </p><p>
 Clamados is moved of right great wrath, but the Queen of the
 Tents showeth Perceval the most honour she may, whereof is
 Clamados right heavy, and saith that never ought any to put his
 trust in woman.  But wrongly he blameth her therein, for she did
 it of the passing great love she hath for Perceval, inasmuch as
 well she knoweth that he is the Best Knight of the world and the
 comeliest.  But it only irketh her the more that she may not find
 in him any sign of special liking toward herself neither in deed
 nor word, whereof is she beyond measure sorrowful.  The knights
 and damsels lay the night in the tents until the morrow, and went
 to hear mass in a chapel that was in the midst of the tents.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIV.
 </p><p>
 When mass was sung, straightway behold you, a knight that cometh
 all armed, bearing a white shield at his neck.  He alighteth in
 the midst of the tents and cometh before the Queen all armed, and
 saith: "Lady, I plain me of a knight that is there within that
 hath slain my lion, and if you do me not right herein, I will
 harass you as much or more than I will him, and will harm you in
 every wise I may.  Wherefore I pray and require you, for the love
 of Messire Gawain, whose man I am, that you do me right herein."
 </p><p>
 "What is the knight's name?" saith the Queen.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "He is called Clamados of the Shadows, and
 methinketh I see him yonder, for I knew him when he was squire."
 </p><p>
 "And what is your name?" saith the Queen.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," I am called Melior of Logres."
 </p><p>
 "Clamados," saith the Queen, "Hear you what this knight saith?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Lady," saith he; "But again I require that you do me right
 of the knight that slew my father and my uncle."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Melior, "I would fain go.  I know not toward whom
 the knight proffereth his gage, but him do I appeal of felony for
 my lion that he hath slain."  He taketh in his hand the skirt of
 his habergeon: "Lady, behold here the gage I offer you."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XV.
 </p><p>
 "Clamados," saith the Queen, "Hear you then not that which this
 knight saith?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "I hear him well.  Truth it is that I slew his
 lion, but not until after he had fallen upon me, and made the
 wounds whereof I have been healed herewithin.  But well you know
 that the knight who came hither last night hath done me greater
 wrong than have I done this other.  Wherefore would I pray you
 that I may take vengeance of him first."
 </p><p>
 "You hear," saith she, "how this knight that hath come hither all
 armed is fain to go back forthwith.  Quit you, therefore, of him
 first, and then will we take thought of the other."
 </p><p>
 "Lady, gramercy!" saith Meliot, "and Messire Gawain will take it
 in right good part, for this knight hath slain my lion that
 defended me from all my enemies.  Nor is it true that the
 entrance to your tent was deserted on account of my lion; and in
 despite of me hath he hung the head at my gate."
 </p><p>
 "As of the lion," saith the Queen, "you have no quarrel against
 him and he slew him in defending his body, but as of the despite
 he did you as you say, when in nought had you done him any wrong,
 it shall not be that right shalt be denied you in my court, and
 if you desire to deliver battle, no blame shall you have
 thereof."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVI.
 </p><p>
 Clamados maketh arm him and mounteth on his horse, and he seemeth
 right hardy of his arms and valorous.  He cometh right in the
 midst of the tent, where the ground was fair and level, and found
 Meilot of Logres all armed upon his horse, and a right comely
 knight was he and a deliver.  And the ladies and damsels were
 round about the tilting-ground.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Queen to Perceval, "I will that you keep the
 field for these knights."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "At your pleasure."
 </p><p>
 Meliot moveth toward Clamados right swiftly and Clamados toward
 him, and they melled together on their shields in such sort that
 they pierced them and cleft the mail of their habergeons asunder
 with the points of their spears, and the twain are both wounded
 so that the blood rayeth forth of their bodies.  The knights draw
 asunder to take their career, for their spears were broken short,
 and they come back the one toward the other with a great rush,
 and smite each other on the breast with their spears so stiffly
 that there is none but should have been pierced within the flesh,
 for the habergeons might protect them not.  They hurtle against
 each other so strongly that knights and horses fall together to
 the ground all in a heap.  The Queen and the damsels have great
 pity of the two knights, for they see that they are both so
 passing sore wounded.  The two knights rise to their feet and
 hold their swords naked and run the one on the other right
 wrathfully, with such force as they had left.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Queen to Perceval, "Go part these two knights
 asunder that one slay not the other, for they are sore wounded."
 </p><p>
 Perceval goeth to part them and cometh to Meliot of Logres.
 "Sir," saith he, "Withdraw yourself back; you have done enough."
 </p><p>
 Clamados felt that he was sore wounded in two places, and that
 the wound he had in his breast was right great.  He draweth
 himself back. The Queen is come thither. "Fair nephew," saith
 she, "Are you badly wounded?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, Lady," saith Clamados.
 </p><p>
 "Certes," saith the Queen, "this grieveth me, but never yet saw I
 knight and he were desirous of fighting, but came at some time by
 mischance.  A man may not always stand on all his rights."
 </p><p>
 She made him be carried on his shield into a tent, and made
 search his wounds, and saw that of one had he no need to fear,
 but that the other was right sore perilous.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVII.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Clamados, "Once more do I pray and require you that
 you allow not the knight that slew my father to issue forth from
 hence, save he deliver good hostage that he will come back when I
 shall be healed."
 </p><p>
 "So will I do, sith that it is your pleasure."
 </p><p>
 The Queen cometh to the other knight that was wounded, for that
 he declareth himself Messire Gawain's man, and maketh search his
 wounds, and they say that he hath not been hurt so sore as is
 Clamados.  She commandeth them to tend him and wait upon him
 right well-willingly, "Sir," saith she to Perceval, "Behoveth you
 abide here until such time as my nephew be heal, for you know
 well that whereof he plaineth against you, nor would I that you
 should depart hence without clearing you of the blame."
 </p><p>
 "Lady, no wish have I to depart without your leave, but rather
 shall I be ready to clear myself of blame whensoever and
 wheresoever time and place may be.  But herewithin may I make not
 so long sojourn.  Natheless to this will I pledge my word, that I
 will return thither within a term of fifteen days from the time
 he shall be whole."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Damsel of the Car, "I will remain here in
 hostage for you."
 </p><p>
 "But do you pray him," saith the Queen, "that he remain
 herewithin with us."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVIII.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith Perceval, "I may not, for I left Lancelot wounded
 right sore in my uncle's hermitage."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Queen, "I would fain that remaining here might
 have pleased you as well as it would me."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "none ought it to displease to be with you, but
 every man behoveth keep his word as well as he may, and none
 ought to lie to so good a knight as he."
 </p><p>
 "You promise me, then," saith the Queen, "that you will return
 hither the soonest you may, or at the least, within the term
 appointed after you shall have learnt that Clamados is healed, to
 defend you of the treason that he layeth upon you?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "and if he die shall I be quit?"
 </p><p>
 "Yea, truly, Sir, and so be that you have no will to come for
 love of me.  For right well should I love your coming."
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "never shall be the day my services shall fail
 you, so I be in place, and you in need thereof."
 </p><p>
 He taketh leave and departeth, armed.  The Damsel of the Car
 commendeth him to God, and Perceval departeth full speed and
 rideth so far on his journeys that he cometh to his uncle's
 hermitage and entereth in, thinking to find Lancelot.  But his
 uncle telleth him that he hath departed all sound and all heal of
 his wound, as of all other malady, as him thinketh.
