 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XIV</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Herewithal the story is silent of Messire Gawain, and saith that
 Lancelot seeketh Perceval in like manner as did Messire Gawain,
 and rideth until that he cometh to the hermitage where he hanged
 the thieves.  Joseus made right great joy of him.  He asked him
 whether he knew any tidings of the son of the Widow Lady.
 </p><p>
 "I have seen him sithence that he came from King Arthur's court
 but once only, and whither he is gone I know not."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "I would see him right fain.  King Arthur
 sendeth for him by me."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the hermit, "I know not when I may see him again,
 for when once he departeth hence he is not easy to find."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot entereth the chapel with the hermit, and seeth the
 shield that Perceval brought from King Arthur's court beside the
 altar.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "I see his shield yonder.  Hide him not
 from me."
 </p><p>
 "I will not do so," saith the hermit.  "This shield, truly, is
 his, but he took with him another from hence, of gold with a
 green cross."
 </p><p>
 "And know you no tidings of Messire Gawain?"
 </p><p>
 "I have not seen Messire Gawain sithence tofore I entered into
 this hermitage.  But you have fallen into sore hatred on account
 of the four robbers that were knights whom you hanged.  For their
 kinsmen are searching for you in this forest and in other, and
 are thieves like as were the others, and they have their hold in
 this forest, wherein they bestow their robberies and plunder.
 Wherefore I pray you greatly be on your guard against them."
 </p><p>
 "So will I," saith Lancelot, "please God."
 </p><p>
 He lay the night in the hermitage, and departeth on the morrow
 after that he hath heard mass and prayeth God grant he may find
 Perceval or Messire Gawain.  He goeth his way amidst the strange
 forests until that he cometh to a strong castle that was builded
 right seemly.  He Looketh before him and seeth a knight that was
 issued thereout, and was riding a great pace on a strong
 destrier, and carded a bird on his fist toward the forest.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 When he saw Lancelot coming he drew up. "Sir," saith he, "Be
 welcome."
 </p><p>
 "Good adventure to you," saith Lancelot.  "What castle is this?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, it is the Castle of the Golden Circlet.  And I go to meet
 the knights and dames that come to the castle, for this day is
 the day ordained for the adoration of the Golden Circlet."
 </p><p>
 "What is the Golden Circlet?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, it is the Crown of Thorns," saith the knight, "that the
 Saviour of the world had on His head when He was set upon the
 Rood.  Wherefore the Queen of this castle hath set it in gold and
 precious stones in such sort that the knights and dames of this
 kingdom come to behold it once in the year.  But it is said that
 the knight that was first at the Graal shall conquer it, and
 therefore is no strange knight allowed to enter.  But, so please
 you, I will lead you to mine own hold that is in this forest."
 </p><p>
 "Right great thanks," saith Lancelot, "But as yet it is not time
 to take lodging."
 </p><p>
 He taketh leave of the knight, and so departeth and looketh at
 the castle, and saith that in right great worship should the
 knight be held that by the valour of his chivalry shall conquer
 so noble a hallow as is the Golden Circlet when it is kept safe
 in a place so strong.  He goeth his way right amidst the forest,
 and looketh forth before him and seeth coming the damsel that
 hath the knight carried in the litter for the dead.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Be welcome."
 </p><p>
 "Sir, God give you good adventure!  Sir," saith the damsel,
 "Greatly ought I to hate the knight that slew this knight, for
 that he hath forced me thus to lead him in this wise by fell and
 forest.  So also ought I to mislike me much of the knight that it
 standeth upon to avenge him, whom I may not find."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Who slew this knight?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "The Lord of the Burning Dragon."
 </p><p>
 "And who ought of right to avenge him?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "The knight that was in the Red Launde at the
 assembly, that jousted with Messire Gawain, and had the prize of
 the tournament."
 </p><p>
 "Did he better than Messire Gawain?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, so did they adjudge him; for that he was a longer time in
 the assembly."
 </p><p>
 "A good knight was he, then," saith Lancelot, "sith that he did
 better than Messire Gawain!"
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the damsel, "You say true, for he is the Best
 Knight of the World."
 </p><p>
 "And what shield beareth he?" saith Lancelot.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "At the assembly he bore white arms, but
 before that, he had arms of another semblance, and one shield
 that he had was green, and one gold with a green cross."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "Did Messire Gawain know him?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, not at all, whereof is he right sorrowful."
 </p><p>
 "Is he, then," saith he, "Perceval, the son of the Widow Lady?"
 </p><p>
 "By my head, you say true!"
 </p><p>
 "Ha, God!" saith Lancelot, "the more am I mazed how Messire
 Gawain knew him not.  Damsel," saith he, "And know you
 whitherward they are gone?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I know not whither, nor have I any tidings,
 neither or the one nor the other."
 </p><p>
 He departeth from the damsel and rideth until the sun was set. 
 He found the rocks darkling and the forest right deep and
 perilous of seeming.  He rode on, troubled in thought, and weary
 and full of vexation.  Many a time Looketh he to right and to
 left, and he may see any place where he may lodge.  A dwarf
 espied him, but Lancelot saw him not.  The dwarf goeth right
 along a by-way that is in the forest, and goeth to a little hold
 of robber-knights that lay out of the way, where was a damsel
 that kept watch over the hold.  The robbers had another hold
 where was the damsel where the passing knights are deceived and
 entrapped.  The dwarf cometh forthright to the damsel, and saith:
 "Now shall we see what you will do, for see, here cometh the
 knight that hanged your uncle grid your three cousins german."
 </p><p>
 "Now shall I have the best of him," saith she, "as for mine own
 share in this matter, but take heed that you be garnished ready
 to boot."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the dwarf, "that will I, for, please God, he
 shall not escape us again, save he be dead."
 </p><p>
 The damsel was of passing great beauty and was clad right
 seemingly, but right treacherous was she of heart, nor no marvel
 was it thereof, for she came of the lineage of robbers and was
 nurtured on theft and robbery, and she herself had helped to
 murder many a knight.  She is come upon the way, so that Lancelot
 hath to pass her, without her kerchief.  She meeteth Lancelot and
 saluteth him and maketh him right great joy, of semblant.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Follow this path that goeth into the forest,
 and you will find a hold that my forefathers stablished for
 harbouring of such knights as might be passing through the
 forest.  The night is dark already, and if you pass on further no
 hold will you find nearer than a score leagues Welsh."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Gramercy heartily of this that it
 pleaseth you to say, for right gladly will I harbour me here, for
 it is more than time to take lodging, and with you more willingly
 than another."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 On this wise they go their way talking, as far as the hold. 
 There was none therewithin save only the dwarf, for the five
 robber knights were in their hold at the lower end of the forest.
 The dwarf took Lancelot's horse, and stabled him, then went up
 into the hall above, and gave himself up wholly to serving him. 
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the damsel, "Allow yourself to be disarmed, and have
 full assurance of safety."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith he, "Small trouble is it for me to wear mine
 arms, and lightly may I abide it."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Please God, you shall nor lie armed within
 yonder.  Never yet did knight so that harboured therein."
 </p><p>
 But the more the damsel presseth him to disarm, the more it
 misliketh him, for the place seemeth him right dark and
 foul-seeming, wherefore will he not disarm nor disgarnish
 himself.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Meseemeth you are suspicious of something, but
 no call have you to misdoubt of aught here within, for the place
 is quite safe.  I know not whether you have enemies?"
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith Lancelot, "Never yet knew I knight that was loved
 of everybody, yet sometimes might none tell the reason thereof."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot, so saith the story, would not disarm him, wherefore he
 made the table be set, and sate thereat beside the damsel at
 meat.  He made his shield and his helmet and spear be brought
 into the hall.  He leant back upon a rich couch that was
 therewithin, with his sword by his side, all armed.  He was weary
 and the bed was soft, so he went to sleep.  Howbeit, the dwarf
 mounteth on his horse that he had left still saddled, and goeth
 his way to the other hold where the robbers were, all five, that
 were Lancelot's mortal enemies.  The damsel remained all alone
 with him that she hated of a right deadly hate.  She thought to
 herself that gladly would she slay him, and that, so she might
 compass it, she would be thereof held in greater worship of all
 the world, for well she knew that he was a good knight, and that
 one so good she had never slain.  She filched away the sword that
 was at his side, then drew it from the scabbard, then looketh to
 see where she may lightliest smite him to slay him.  She seeth
 that his head is so covered of armour that nought appeareth
 thereof save only the face, and she bethinketh her that one
 stroke nor two on the helmet would scarce hurt him greatly, but
 that and she might lift the skirt of his habergeon without
 awakening him she might well slay him, for so might she thrust
 the sword right through his heart.  Meanwhile, as she was
 searching thus, Lancelot, that was sleeping and took no heed
 thereof, saw, so it seemed him, a little cur-dog come
 therewithin, and brought with him sundry great mongrel ban-dogs
 that ran upon him on all sides, and the little cur bit at him
 likewise among the others.  The ban-dogs held him so fast that he
 might not get away from them.  He seeth that a greyhound bitch
 had hold of his sword, and she had hands like a woman, and was
 fain to slay him.  And it seemed him that he snatched the sword
 from her and slew the greyhound bitch and the biggest and most
 masterful of the ban-dogs and the little cur.  He was scared of
 the dream and started up and awoke, and felt the scabbard of his
 sword by his side, that the damsel had left there all empty, the
 which he perceived not, and soon thereafter he fell on sleep
 again.  The dwarf that had stolen his horse cometh to the robber
 knights, and crieth to them, "Up, Sirs, and haste you to come and
 avenge you of your mortal enemy that sent the best of your
 kindred out of the world with such shame!  See, here is his horse
 that I bring you for a token!" He alighteth of the horse, and
 giveth him up to them.  Right joyous are the robbers of the
 tidings he telleth them.  The dwarf bringeth them all armed to
 the hold.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 Lancelot was awake, all scared of the dream he had dreamed.  He
 seeth them enter within all armed, and the damsel crieth to them:
 "Now will it appear," saith she, "what you will do!"
 </p><p>
 Lancelot hath leapt up, thinking to take his sword, but findeth
 the scabbard all empty.  The damsel that held the sword was the
 first of all to run upon him, and the five knights and the dwarf
 set upon him from every side.  He perceived that it was his own
 sword the damsel held, the one he prized above all other.  He
 taketh his lance that was at his bed's head and cometh toward the
 master of the knights at a great sweep, and smiteth him so
 fiercely that he thrusteth him right through the body so that the
 lance passeth a fathom beyond, and beareth him to the ground
 dead.  His spear broke as he drew it back.  He runneth to the
 damsel that held the sword, and wresteth it forth of her hands
 and holdeth it fast with his arm right against his flank and
 grippeth it to him right strait; albeit she would fain snatch it
 again from him by force, whereat Lancelot much marvelled.  He
 swingeth it above him, and the four knights come back upon him.
 He thinketh to smite one with the sword, when the damsel leapeth
 in between them, thinking to hold Lancelot fast, and thereby the
 blow that should have fallen on one of the knights caught the
 damsel right through the head and slew her, whereof he was right
 sorrowful, howsoever she might have wrought against him.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI.
 </p><p>
 When the four knights saw the damsel dead, right grieved were
 they thereof.  And the dwarf crieth out to them: "Lords, now
 shall it be seen how you will avenge the sore mischief done you.
 So help me God, great shame may you have and you cannot conquer a
 single knight."
 </p><p>
 They run upon him again on all sides, but maugre all their heads
 he goeth thither where he thinketh to find his horse; but him
 findeth he not.  Thereby well knoweth he that the dwarf hath made
 away with him, wherefore he redoubled his hardiment and his wrath
 waxed more and more.  And the knights were not to be lightly
 apaid when they saw their lord dead and the damsel that was their
 cousin.  Sore buffets they dealt him of their swords the while he
 defended himself as best he might.  He caught the dwarf that was
 edging them on to do him hurt, and clave him as far as the
 shoulders, and wounded two of the knights right badly, and he
 himself was hurt in two places; but he might not depart from the
 house, nor was his horse there within, nor was there but a single
 entrance into the hall.  The knights set themselves without the
 door and guard the issue, and Lancelot was within with them that
 were dead.  He sate himself down at the top of the hall to rest
 him, for he was sore spent with the blows he had given and
 received.  When he had rested himself awhile, he riseth to his
 feet and seeth that they have sate them down in the entrance to
 the hall.  He mounteth up to the windows and flingeth them down
 them that were dead within through the windows.  Just then the
 day appeared, fair and clear, and the birds began to sing amidst
 the forest, whereof the hall was overshadowed.  He maketh fast
 the door of the hall and barreth it and shutteth the knights
 without; and they say one to the other and swear it, that they
 will not depart thence until they have taken him or famished him
 to death.  Little had Lancelot recked of their threats and he
 might have had his horse at will, but he was not so sure of his
 stroke afoot as a-horseback, as no knight never is.  Him thinketh
 he may well abide the siege as long as God shall please, for the
 hall was well garnished of meat in right great joints.  He is
 there within all alone, and the four knights without that keep
 watch that he goeth not, but neither wish nor will hath he to go
 forth afoot; but, and he had had his horse, the great hardiment
 that he hath in him would have made that he should go forth
 honourably, howsoever they without might have taken it and what
 grievance soever they might have had thereof.
