 <h1>The High History of the Holy Graal: Branch XII</h1> 
 TITLE I.
 <p>
 Now is the story silent about Perceval, and saith that King
 Arthur is at Pannenoisance in Wales with great plenty of knights.
 Lancelot and Messire Gawain are repaired thither, whereof all the
 folk make great joy.  The King asketh of Messire Gawain and
 Lancelot whether they have seen Lohot his son in none of these
 islands nor in none of these forests, and they answer him that
 they have seen him nowhere.
 </p><p>
 "I marvel much," saith the King, "what hath become of him, for no
 tidings have I heard of him beyond these, that Kay the Seneschal
 slew Logrin the giant, whose head he brought me, whereof I made
 great joy, and right willingly did I make Kay's lands the broader
 thereof, and well ought I to do him such favour, for he avenged
 me of him that did my land more hurt than any other, wherefore I
 love him greatly."
 </p><p>
 But, and the King had only known how Kay had wrought against him,
 he would not have so highly honoured his chivalry and his
 hardiment.  The King sate one day at meat and Queen Guenievre at
 his side.  Thereupon behold you, a damsel that alighteth before
 the palace, then mounteth the steps of the hall and is come
 before the King and the Queen.
 </p><p>
 "Sir, I salute you as the sorest dismayed and most discounselled
 damsel that ever you have seen!  Wherefore am I come to demand a
 boon of you for the nobleness and valour of your heart."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "God counsel you of His will and
 pleasure, and I myself am full fain to partake therein."
 </p><p>
 The damsel looketh at the shield that hangeth in the midst of the
 hall.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "I beseech you that you deign grant me the aid
 of the knight that shall bear this shield from hence.  For sorer
 need have I thereof than ever another of them that are
 discounselled."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "Full well shall I be pleased, so the
 knight be also fain to do as you say."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "And he be so good knight as he is reported,
 never will he refuse your prayer, nor would he mine, if only I
 were here at such time as he shall come.  For, had I been able to
 find my brother that I have been seeking this long time, then
 well should I have been succoured long agone!  But I have sought
 him in many lands, nor never could I learn where he is. 
 Therefore to my sorrow, behoveth me to ride all lonely by the
 strange islands and put my body in jeopardy of death, whereof
 ought these knights to have great pity."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II.
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "For this reason do I refuse you nought
 of that you wish, and right willingly will I put myself to
 trouble herein."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "much thanks to God thereof!"
 </p><p>
 He maketh her be set at meat, and much honour be done her.  When
 the cloths were drawn, the Queen leadeth her into her chamber
 with the maidens, and maketh much joy of her.  The brachet that
 was brought thither with the shield was lying on a couch of
 straw.  He would not know the Queen nor her damsels nor the
 knights that were in the court, but so soon as ever he heard the
 damsel he cometh to her and maketh greater joy of her than ever
 was brachet seen to make before.  The Queen and her damsels
 marvelled much thereof, as did the damsel herself to whom the
 brachet made such joy, for never since that he was brought into
 the hall had they seen him rejoice of any.  The Queen asked her
 whether she knew him.
 </p><p>
 "Certes, Lady, no, for never, so far as I know, have I seen him
 before."
 </p><p>
 The brachet will not leave her, but will be always on her lap,
 nor can she move anywhither but he followeth her.  The damsel is
 long time in the court in this manner, albeit as she that had
 sore need of succour she remained in the chapel every day after
 that the Queen was come forth, and wept right tenderly before the
 image of the Saviour, and prayed right sweetly that His Mother
 would counsel her, for that she had been left in sore peril of
 losing her castle.  The Queen asked her one day who her brother
 was.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith she, "one of the best knights of the world, whereof
 have I heard witness.  But he departed from my father's and
 mother's hostel a right young squire.  My father is since dead,
 and my Lady mother is left without help and without counsel,
 wherefore hath a certain man reaved her of her land and her
 castles and slain her men.  The very castle wherein she hath her
 hold would he have seized long agone had it not been for Messire
 Gawain that made it be safe-guarded against her enemies for a
 year.  The term is now ended and my Lady mother is in dread lest
 she shall lose her castle, for none other hold hath she.
 Wherefore is it that she hath sent me to seek for my brother, for
 she hath been told that he is a good knight, and for that I may
 not find him am I come to this court to beseech of King Arthur
 succour of the knight that shall bear away the shield, for I have
 heard tell that he is the Best knight of the world; and, for the
 bounty that is in him will he therefore have pity on me."
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the Queen, "Would that you had found him, for
 great joy would it be unto me that your mother were succoured,
 and God grant that he that ought to bear the shield come quickly,
 and grant him courage that he be fain to succour your mother."
 </p><p>
 "So shall he be, please God, for never was good knight that was
 without pity."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III.
 </p><p>
 The Queen hath much pity of the damsel, for she was of right
 great beauty, and well might it be seen by her cheer and her
 semblant that no joy had she.  She had told the Queen her name
 and the name of her father and mother, and the Queen told her
 that many a time had she heard tell of Alain li Gros, and that he
 was said to be a worshipful man and good knight.  The King lay
 one night beside the Queen, and was awoke from his first sleep so
 that he might not go to sleep again.  He rose and did on a great
 grey cape and issueth forth of the chamber and cometh to the
 windows of the hall that opened toward the sea, calm and
 untroubled, so that much pleasure had he of looking thereat and
 leaning at the windows.  When he had been there of a long space,
 he looked out to sea and saw coming afar off as it were the
 shining of a candle in the midst of the sea.  Much he marvelled
 what it might be.  He looked at it until he espied what seemed
 him to be a ship wherein was the light, and he was minded not to
 move until such time as he should know whether a ship it were or
 something other.  The longer he looketh at it, the better
 perceiveth he that it is a ship, and that it was coming with
 great rushing toward the castle as fast as it might.  The King
 espieth it nigh at hand, but none seeth he within nor without
 save one old man, ancient and bald, of right passing seemliness
 that held the rudder of the ship.  The ship was covered of a
 right rich cloth in the midst and the sail was lowered, for the
 sea was calm and quiet.  The ship was arrived under the palace
 and was quite still.  When the ship had taken ground, the King
 looketh thereat with much marvelling, and knoweth not who is
 there within, for not a soul heareth he speak.  Him thinketh that
 he will go see what is within the ship, and he issueth forth of
 the hall, and cometh thither where the ship was arrived, but he
 might not come anigh for the flowing of the sea.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith he that held the rudder, "Allow me a little!"
 </p><p>
 He launcheth forth of the ship a little boat, and the King
 entereth thereinto, and so cometh into the great ship, and
 findeth a knight that lay all armed upon a table of ivory, and
 had set his shield at his head.  At the head of his bed had he
 two tall twisted links of wax in two candlesticks of gold, and
 the like at his feet, and his hands were crossed upon his breast.
 The King draweth nigh toward him and so looketh at him, and
 seemed him that never had he seen so comely a knight.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the master of the ship, "For God's sake draw you
 back and let the knight rest, for thereof hath he sore need."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the King, "who is the knight?"
 </p><p>
 "Sir, this would he well tell you were he willing, but of me may
 you know it not."
 </p><p>
 "Will he depart forthwith from hence?" saith the King.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the master, "Not before he hath been in this hall,
 but he hath had sore travail and therefore he taketh rest."
 </p><p>
 When the King heard say that he would come into his palace,
 thereof had he great joy.  He cometh to the Queen's chamber and
 telleth her how the ship is arrived.  The Queen riseth and two of
 her damsels with her, and apparelleth her of a kirtle of cloth of
 silk, furred of ermine, and cometh into the midst of the hall.
 Thereupon behold you, the knight that cometh all armed and the
 master of the ship before him bearing the twisted link of wax in
 the candlestick of gold in front of him, and the knight held his
 sword all naked.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Queen, "Well may you be welcome!"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "God grant you joy and good adventure."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Please God we have nought to fear of you?"
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith he, "No fear ought you to have!"
 </p><p>
 The King seeth that he beareth the red shield with the white hart
 whereof he had heard tell.  The brachet that was in the hall
 heareth the knight.  He cometh racing toward him and leapeth
 about his legs and maketh great joy of him.  And the knight
 playeth with him, then taketh the shield that hung at the column,
 and hangeth the other there, and cometh back thereafter toward
 the door of the hall.
 </p><p>
 "Lady," saith the King, "Pray the knight that he go not so
 hastily."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the knight, "No leisure have I to abide, but at some
 time shall you see me again."
 </p><p>
 The knights also say as much, and the King and Queen are right
 heavy of his departure, but they durst not press him beyond his
 will.  He is entered into the ship, and the brachet with him. 
 The master draweth the boat within, and so they depart and leave
 the castle behind.  King Arthur abideth at Pannenoisance, and is
 right sorrowful of the knight, that he hath gone his way so soon.
 The knights arose throughout the castle when the day waxed light,
 and learnt the tidings of the knight that had borne the shield
 thence, and were right grieved for that they had not seen him.
 The damsel that had asked the boon cometh to the King.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "Did you speak of my business to the knight?"
 </p><p>
 "Damsel," saith the King, "Never a whit!  to my sorrow, for he
 hath departed sooner than I would!"
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith she, "You have done a wrong and a sin, but, please
 God, so good a King as are you shall not fail of his covenants to
 damsel so forlorn as am I."
 </p><p>
 The King was right sorrowful for that he had remembered not the
 damsel.  She departeth from the court, and taketh leave of the
 King and Queen, and saith that she herself will go seek the
 knight, and that, so she may find him, she will hold the King
 quit of his covenant.  Messire Gawain and Lancelot are returned
 to the court, and have heard the tidings of the knight that hath
 carried away the shield, and are right grieved that they have not
 seen him, and Messire Gawain more than enough, for that he had
 lien in his mother's house.  Lancelot seeth the shield that he
 had left on the column, and knoweth it well, and saith, "Now know
 I well that Perceval hath been here, for this shield was he wont
 to bear, and the like also his father bore."
 </p><p>
 "Ha," saith Messire Gawain, "What ill-chance have I that I may
 not see the Good Knight!"
 </p><p>
 "Messire Gawain," saith Lancelot, "So nigh did I see him that
 methought he would have killed me, for never before did I essay
 onset so stout nor so cruel of force of arms, and I myself
 wounded him, and when he knew me he made right great joy of me.
 And I was with him at the house of King Hermit a long space until
 that I was healed."
 </p><p>
 "Lancelot," saith Messire Gawain, "I would that he had wounded
 me, so I were not too sore harmed thereof, so that I might have
 been with him so long time as were you."
 </p><p>
 "Lords," saith the King, "Behoveth you go on quest of him or I
 will go, for I am bound to beseech his aid on behalf of a damsel
 that asked me thereof, but she told me that, so she might find
 him first, I should be quit of her request."
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith the Queen, "You will do a right great service and
 you may counsel her herein, for sore discounselled is she.  She
 hath told me that she was daughter of Alain li Gros of the
 Valleys of Camelot, and that her mother's name is Yglais, and her
 own Dindrane."
 </p><p>
 "Ha, Lady," saith Messire Gawain, "She is sister to the knight
 that hath borne away the shield, for I lay at her mother's house
 wherein I was right well lodged."
 </p><p>
 "By my head," saith the Queen, "it may well be, for so soon as
 she came in hither. the brachet that would have acquaintance with
 none, made her great joy, and when the knight came to seek the
 shield, the brachet, that had remained in the hall, played gladly
 with him and went "
 </p><p>
 "By my faith," saith Messire Gawain, "I will go in quest of the
 knight, for right great desire have I to see him."
 </p><p>
 "And I," saith Lancelot, "Never so glad have I been to see him
 aforetime as! should be now."
 </p><p>
 "Howsoever it be," saith the King, "I pray you so speed my
 business that the damsel shall not be able to plain her of me."
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V.
 </p><p>
 "Sir," saith Lancelot, "We will tell him and we may find him,
 that his sister is gone in quest of him, and that she hath been
 at your court."
 </p><p>
 The two knights depart from the court to enter on the quest of
 the Good Knight, and leave the castle far behind them and ride in
 the midst of a high forest until they find a cross in the midst
 of a launde, there where all the roads of the forest join
 together.
 </p><p>
 "Lancelot," saith Messire Gawain, "Choose which road soever you
 will, and so let each go by himself, so that we may the sooner
 hear tidings of the Good Knight, and let us meet together again
 at this cross at the end of a year and let either tell other how
 he hath sped, for please God in one place or another we shall
 hear tidings of him."
 </p><p>
 Lancelot taketh the way to the right, and Messire Gawain to the
 left.  Therewithal they depart and commend them one another to
 God.
