 CHAPTER VIII
 
 Of an advision which Sir Bors had that night, and how he
 fought and overcame his adversary.
 
 
 AND anon as he was asleep him befell a vision, that there
 came to him two birds, the one as white as a swan, and
 the other was marvellous black; but it was not so great
 as the other, but in the likeness of a Raven.  Then the
 white bird came to him, and said:  An thou wouldst give
 me meat and serve me I should give thee all the riches of
 the world, and I shall make thee as fair and as white as I
 am.  So the white bird departed, and there came the black
 bird to him, and said:  An thou wolt, serve me to-morrow
 and have me in no despite though I be black, for wit thou
 well that more availeth my blackness than the other's
 whiteness.  And then he departed.
 
 And he had another vision: him thought that he
 came to a great place which seemed a chapel, and there he
 found a chair set on the left side, which was worm-eaten
 and feeble.  And on the right hand were two flowers like
 a lily, and the one would have benome the other's whiteness,
 but a good man departed them that the one touched
 not the other; and then out of every flower came out
 many flowers, and fruit great plenty.  Then him thought
 the good man said:  Should not he do great folly that
 would let these two flowers perish for to succour the
 rotten tree, that it fell not to the earth? Sir, said he, it
 seemeth me that this wood might not avail.  Now keep
 thee, said the good man, that thou never see such adventure
 befall thee.
 
 Then he awaked and made a sign of the cross in midst
 of the forehead, and so rose and clothed him.  And there
 came the lady of the place, and she saluted him, and he
 her again, and so went to a chapel and heard their service.
 And there came a company of knights, that the lady had
 sent for, to lead Sir Bors unto battle.  Then asked he his
 arms.  And when he was armed she prayed him to take a
 little morsel to dine.  Nay, madam, said he, that shall I
 not do till I have done my battle, by the grace of God.
 And so he leapt upon his horse, and departed, all the
 knights and men with him.  And as soon as these two
 ladies met together, she which Bors should fight for
 complained her, and said:  Madam, ye have done me wrong
 to bereave me of my lands that King Aniause gave me,
 and full loath I am there should be any battle.  Ye shall
 not choose, said the other lady, or else your knight withdraw
 him.
 
 Then there was the cry made, which party had the
 better of the two knights, that his lady should rejoice all
 the land.  Now departed the one knight here, and the
 other there.  Then they came together with such a
 raundon that they pierced their shields and their hauberks,
 and the spears flew in pieces, and they wounded either
 other sore.  Then hurtled they together, so that they fell
 both to the earth, and their horses betwixt their legs; and
 anon they arose, and set hands to their swords, and smote
 each one other upon the heads, that they made great
 wounds and deep, that the blood went out of their bodies.
 For there found Sir Bors greater defence in that knight
 more than he weened.  For that Pridam was a passing
 good knight, and he wounded Sir Bors full evil, and he
 him again; but ever this Pridam held the stour in like
 hard.  That perceived Sir Bors, and suffered him till he
 was nigh attaint.  And then he ran upon him more and
 more, and the other went back for dread of death.  So in
 his withdrawing he fell upright, and Sir Bors drew his
 helm so strongly that he rent it from his head, and gave
 him great strokes with the flat of his sword upon the
 visage, and bade him yield him or he should slay him.
 Then he cried him mercy and said:  Fair knight, for God's
 love slay me not, and I shall ensure thee never to war
 against thy lady, but be alway toward her.  Then Bors
 let him be; then the old lady fled with all her knights.
