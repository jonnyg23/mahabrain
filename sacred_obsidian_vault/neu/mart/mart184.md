 CHAPTER XXXI
 
 How Sir Tristram rode after Palamides, and how he found
 him and fought with him, and by the means of Isoud
 the battle ceased.
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Tristram, that when he was come home and
 wist La Beale Isoud was gone with Sir Palamides, wit ye well he
 was wroth out of measure.  Alas, &lt;330&gt;said Sir Tristram, I am
 this day shamed.  Then he cried to Gouvernail his man:  Haste
 thee that I were armed and on horseback, for well I wot Lambegus
 hath no might nor strength to withstand Sir Palamides: alas that
 I have not been in his stead!  So anon as he was armed and horsed
 Sir Tristram and Gouvernail rode after into the forest, and
 within a while he found his knight Lambegus almost wounded to the
 death; and Sir Tristram bare him to a forester, and charged him
 to keep him well.  And then he rode forth, and there he found Sir
 Adtherp sore wounded, and he told him how the queen would have
 drowned herself had he not been, and how for her sake and love he
 had taken upon him to do battle with Sir Palamides.  Where is my
 lady? said Sir Tristram.  Sir, said the knight, she is sure
 enough within my castle, an she can hold her within it. 
 Gramercy, said Sir Tristram, of thy great goodness.  And so he
 rode till he came nigh to that castle; and then Sir Tristram saw
 where Sir Palamides sat at the gate sleeping, and his horse
 pastured fast afore him.  Now go thou, Gouvernail, said Sir
 Tristram, and bid him awake, and make him ready.  So Gouvernail
 rode unto him and said:  Sir Palamides, arise, and take to thee
 thine harness.  But he was in such a study he heard not what
 Gouvernail said.  So Gouvernail came again and told Sir Tristram
 he slept, or else he was mad.  Go thou again, said Sir Tristram,
 and bid him arise, and tell him that I am here, his mortal foe. 
 So Gouvernail rode again and put upon him the butt of his spear,
 and said:  Sir Palamides, make thee ready, for wit ye well Sir
 Tristram hoveth yonder, and sendeth thee word he is thy mortal
 foe.
     And therewithal Sir Palamides arose stilly, without words,
 and gat his horse, and saddled him and bridled him, and lightly
 he leapt upon, and gat his spear in his hand, and either feutred
 their spears and hurtled fast together; and there Tristram smote
 down Sir Palamides over his horse's tail.  Then lightly Sir
 Palamides put his shield afore him and drew his sword.  And there
 began strong battle on both parts, for both they fought for the
 love of one lady, and ever she lay on the walls and beheld
 &lt;331&gt;them how they fought out of measure, and either were wounded
 passing sore, but Palamides was much sorer wounded.  Thus they
 fought tracing and traversing more than two hours, that well-nigh
 for dole and sorrow La Beale Isoud swooned.  Alas, she said, that
 one I loved and yet do, and the other I love not, yet it were
 great pity that I should see Sir Palamides slain; for well I know
 by that time the end be done Sir Palamides is but a dead knight:
 because he is not christened I would be loath that he should die
 a Saracen.  And therewithal she came down and besought Sir
 Tristram to fight no more.  Ah, madam, said he, what mean you,
 will ye have me shamed?  Well ye know I will be ruled by you.  I
 will not your dishonour, said La Beale Isoud, but I would that ye
 would for my sake spare this unhappy Saracen Palamides.  Madam,
 said Sir Tristram, I will leave fighting at this time for your
 sake.  Then she said to Sir Palamides:  This shall be your
 charge, that thou shalt go out of this country while I am
 therein.  I will obey your commandment, said Sir Palamides, the
 which is sore against my will.  Then take thy way, said La Beale
 Isoud, unto the court of King Arthur, and there recommend me unto
 Queen Guenever, and tell her that I send her word that there be
 within this land but four lovers, that is, Sir Launcelot du Lake
 and Queen Guenever, and Sir Tristram de Liones and Queen Isoud.
