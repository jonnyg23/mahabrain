 CHAPTER XXII
 
 How Launcelot after that he was hurt of a gentlewoman
 came to an hermit, and of other matters.
 
 
 NOW mercy, fair sir, said the lady, I am a gentlewoman
 that useth here in this forest hunting, and God knoweth I
 saw ye not; but as here was a barren hind at the soil in
 this well, and I weened to have done well, but my hand
 swerved.  Alas, said Sir Launcelot, ye have mischieved
 me.  And so the lady departed, and Sir Launcelot as he
 might pulled out the arrow, and left that head still in his
 buttock, and so he went weakly to the hermitage ever
 more bleeding as he went.  And when Sir Lavaine and
 the hermit espied that Sir Launcelot was hurt, wit you
 well they were passing heavy, but Sir Lavaine wist not
 how that he was hurt nor by whom.  And then were they
 wroth out of measure.
 
 Then with great pain the hermit gat out the arrow's
 head out of Sir Launcelot's buttock, and much of his blood
 he shed, and the wound was passing sore, and unhappily
 smitten, for it was in such a place that he might not sit in
 no saddle.  Have mercy, Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, I may
 call myself the most unhappiest man that liveth, for ever
 when I would fainest have worship there befalleth me
 ever some unhappy thing.  Now so Jesu me help, said Sir
 Launcelot, and if no man would but God, I shall be in the
 field upon Candlemas Day at the jousts, whatsomever fall
 of it: so all that might be gotten to heal Sir Launcelot
 was had.
 
 So when the day was come Sir Launcelot let devise
 that he was arrayed, and Sir Lavaine, and their horses, as
 though they had been Saracens; and so they departed and
 came nigh to the field.  The King of Northgalis with an
 hundred knights with him, and the King of Northumberland
 brought with him an hundred good knights, and
 King Anguish of Ireland brought with him an hundred
 good knights ready to joust, and Sir Galahad, the haut
 prince, brought with him an hundred good knights, and
 the King with the Hundred Knights brought with him
 as many, and all these were proved good knights.  Then
 came in King Arthur's party; and there came in the
 King of Scots with an hundred knights, and King Uriens
 of Gore brought with him an hundred knights, and King
 Howel of Brittany brought with him an hundred knights,
 and Chaleins of Clarance brought with him an hundred
 knights, and King Arthur himself came into the field
 with two hundred knights, and the most part were
 knights of the Table Round, that were proved noble
 knights; and there were old knights set in scaffolds for
 to judge, with the queen, who did best.
