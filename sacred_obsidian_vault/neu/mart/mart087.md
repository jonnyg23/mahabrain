 CHAPTER XXVII
 
 How Sir Uwaine fought with two knights and
 overcame them.
 
 SO was there sikerness made on both parties that no treason
 should be wrought on neither party; so then the knights departed
 and made them ready, and that night Sir Uwaine had great cheer. 
 And on the morn he arose early and heard mass, and brake his
 fast, and so he rode unto the plain without the gates, where
 hoved the two brethren abiding him.  So they rode together
 passing sore, that Sir Edward and Sir Hue brake their spears upon
 Sir Uwaine.  And Sir Uwaine smote Sir Edward that he fell over
 his horse and yet his spear brast not.  And then he spurred his
 horse and came upon Sir Hue and overthrew him, but they soon
 recovered and dressed their shields and drew their swords and
 bade Sir Uwaine alight and do his battle to the uttermost.  Then
 Sir Uwaine devoided his horse suddenly, and put his shield afore
 him and drew his sword, and so they dressed together, and either
 gave other such strokes, and there these two brethren wounded Sir
 Uwaine passing grievously that the Lady of the Rock weened he
 should have died.  And thus they fought together five hours as
 men raged out of reason.  And at the last Sir Uwaine smote Sir
 Edward upon the helm such a stroke that his sword carved unto his
 canel bone, and then Sir Hue abated his courage, but Sir Uwaine
 pressed fast to have slain him.  That saw Sir Hue: he kneeled
 down and yielded him to Sir Uwaine.  And he of his gentleness
 received his sword, and took him by the hand, and went into the
 castle together.  Then the Lady of the Rock was passing glad, and
 the other brother made great sorrow for his brother's death. 
 Then the lady was restored of all her lands, and Sir Hue was
 commanded to be at the court of King Arthur at the next feast of
 Pentecost.  So Sir Uwaine dwelt with the lady nigh half a year,
 for it was &lt;147&gt;long or he might be whole of his great hurts. 
 And so when it drew nigh the term-day that Sir Gawaine, Sir
 Marhaus, and Sir Uwaine should meet at the cross-way, then every
 knight drew him thither to hold his promise that they had made;
 and Sir Marhaus and Sir Uwaine brought their damosels with them,
 but Sir Gawaine had lost his damosel, as it is afore rehearsed.
