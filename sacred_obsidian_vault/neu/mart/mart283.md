 CHAPTER XLVI
 
 Of the Fifth day, and how Sir Lamorak behaved him.
 
 
 HERE beginneth the fifth day.  So it befell that Sir Palomides
 came in the morntide, and proffered to joust thereas
 King Arthur was in a castle there besides Surluse; and
 there encountered with him a worshipful duke, and there
 Sir Palomides smote him over his horse's croup.  And
 this duke was uncle unto King Arthur.  Then Sir Elise's
 son rode unto Palomides, and Palomides served Elise in
 the same wise.  When Sir Uwaine saw this he was wroth.
 Then he took his horse and encountered with Sir Palomides,
 and Palomides smote him so hard that he went to
 the earth, horse and man.  And for to make a short tale,
 he smote down three brethren of Sir Gawaine, that is for
 to say Mordred, Gaheris, and Agravaine.  O Jesu, said
 Arthur, this is a great despite of a Saracen that he shall
 smite down my blood.  And therewithal King Arthur
 was wood wroth, and thought to have made him ready to
 joust.
 
 That espied Sir Lamorak, that Arthur and his blood
 were discomfit; and anon he was ready, and asked Palomides
 if he would any more joust.  Why should I not?
 said Palomides.  Then they hurtled together, and brake
 their spears, and all to-shivered them, that all the castle
 rang of their dints.  Then either gat a greater spear in
 his hand, and they came so fiercely together; but Sir
 Palomides' spear all to-brast and Sir Lamorak's did hold.
 Therewithal Sir Palomides lost his stirrups and lay
 upright on his horse's back.  And then Sir Palomides
 returned again and took his damosel, and Sir Safere returned
 his way.
 
 So, when he was departed, King Arthur came to Sir
 Lamorak and thanked him of his goodness, and prayed
 him to tell him his name.  Sir, said Lamorak, wit thou
 well, I owe you my service, but as at this time I will not
 abide here, for I see of mine enemies many about me.
 Alas, said Arthur, now wot I well it is Sir Lamorak de
 Galis.  O Lamorak, abide with me, and by my crown
 I shall never fail thee: and not so hardy in Gawaine's
 head, nor none of his brethren, to do thee any wrong.
 Sir, said Sir Lamorak, wrong have they done me, and to
 you both.  That is truth, said the king, for they slew
 their own mother and my sister, the which me sore
 grieveth: it had been much fairer and better that ye
 had wedded her, for ye are a king's son as well as they.
 O Jesu, said the noble knight Sir Lamorak unto Arthur,
 her death shall I never forget.  I promise you, and make
 mine avow unto God, I shall revenge her death as soon as
 I see time convenable.  And if it were not at the reverence
 of your highness I should now have been revenged
 upon Sir Gawaine and his brethren.  Truly, said Arthur,
 I will make you at accord.  Sir, said Lamorak, as at this
 time I may not abide with you, for I must to the jousts,
 where is Sir Launcelot, and the haut prince Sir Galahalt.
 
 Then there was a damosel that was daughter to King
 Bandes.  And there was a Saracen knight that hight
 Corsabrin, and he loved the damosel, and in no wise he
 would suffer her to be married; for ever this Corsabrin
 noised her, and named her that she was out of her mind;
 and thus he let her that she might not be married.
