 CHAPTER XV
 
 How King Mark had slain Sir Amant wrongfully to-fore
 King Arthur, and Sir Launcelot fetched King Mark to
 King Arthur.
 
 
 THEN by the license of King Arthur they went to him
 and spake with him; for while the truncheon of the spear
 stuck in his body he spake:  Ah, fair damosels, said
 Amant, recommend me unto La Beale Isoud, and tell her
 that I am slain for the love of her and of Sir Tristram.
 And there he told the damosels how cowardly King Mark
 had slain him, and Sir Bersules, his fellow.  And for that
 deed I appealed him of treason, and here am I slain in a
 righteous quarrel; and all was because Sir Bersules and I
 would not consent by treason to slay the noble knight, Sir
 Tristram.  Then the two maidens cried aloud that all the
 court might hear it, and said:  O sweet Lord Jesu, that
 knowest all hid things, why sufferest Thou so false a
 traitor to vanquish and slay a true knight that fought in
 a righteous quarrel?  Then anon it was sprung to the
 king, and the queen, and to all the lords, that it was King
 Mark that had slain Sir Amant, and Sir Bersules afore
 hand; wherefore they did their battle.  Then was King
 Arthur wroth out of measure, and so were all the other
 knights.  But when Sir Tristram knew all the matter he
 made great dole and sorrow out of measure, and wept for
 sorrow for the loss of the noble knights, Sir Bersules and
 of Sir Amant.
 
 When Sir Launcelot espied Sir Tristram weep he went
 hastily to King Arthur, and said:  Sir, I pray you give me
 leave to return again to yonder false king and knight.  I
 pray you, said King Arthur, fetch him again, but I would
 not that ye slew him, for my worship.  Then Sir Launcelot
 armed him in all haste, and mounted upon a great horse,
 and took a spear in his hand and rode after King Mark.
 And from thence a three mile English Sir Launcelot over
 took him, and bade him:  Turn recreant king and knight,
 for whether thou wilt or not thou shalt go with me to
 King Arthur's court.  King Mark returned and looked
 upon Sir Launcelot, and said:  Fair sir, what is your name?
 Wit thou well, said he, my name is Sir Launcelot, and
 therefore defend thee.  And when King Mark wist that it
 was Sir Launcelot, and came so fast upon him with a spear,
 he cried then aloud:  I yield me to thee, Sir Launcelot,
 honourable knight.  But Sir Launcelot would not hear
 him, but came fast upon him.  King Mark saw that, and
 made no defence, but tumbled adown out of his saddle
 to the earth as a sack, and there he lay still, and cried Sir
 Launcelot mercy.  Arise, recreant knight and king.  I
 will not fight, said King Mark, but whither that ye will
 I will go with you.  Alas, alas, said Sir Launcelot, that I
 may not give thee one buffet for the love of Sir Tristram
 and of La Beale Isoud, and for the two knights that thou
 hast slain traitorly.  And so he mounted upon his horse
 and brought him to King Arthur; and there King Mark
 alighted in that same place, and threw his helm from him
 upon the earth, and his sword, and fell flat to the earth of
 King Arthur's feet, and put him in his grace and mercy.
 So God me help, said Arthur, ye are welcome in a manner,
 and in a manner ye are not welcome.  In this manner ye
 are welcome, that ye come hither maugre thy head, as I
 suppose.  That is truth, said King Mark, and else I had
 not been here, for my lord, Sir Launcelot, brought me
 hither through his fine force, and to him am I yolden to
 as recreant.  Well, said Arthur, ye understand ye ought
 to do me service, homage, and fealty.  And never would
 ye do me none, but ever ye have been against me, and a
 destroyer of my knights; now, how will ye acquit you?
 Sir, said King Mark, right as your lordship will require
 me, unto my power, I will make a large amends.  For he
 was a fair speaker, and false thereunder.  Then for great
 pleasure of Sir Tristram, to make them twain accorded,
 the king withheld King Mark as at that time, and made a
 broken love-day between them.
