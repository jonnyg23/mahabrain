 CHAPTER XXII
 
 How Sir Tristram fought for Sir Anguish and overcame his
 adversary, and how his adversary would never yield him.
 
 NOW make your answer that your champion is ready, for I shall die
 in your quarrel rather than to be recreant.  I have no doubt of
 you, said the king, that, an ye should have ado with Sir
 Launcelot du Lake--  Sir, said Sir Tristram, as for Sir
 Launcelot, he is called the noblest knight of the world, and wit
 ye well that the knights of his blood are noble men, and dread
 shame; and as for Bleoberis, brother unto Sir Blamore, I have
 done battle with him, therefore upon my head it is no shame to
 call him a good knight.  It is noised, said the king, that
 Blamore is the hardier knight.  Sir, as for that let him be, he
 shall never be refused, an as he were the best knight that now
 beareth shield or spear.
 
 &lt;315&gt;
 So King Anguish departed unto King Carados and the kings that
 were that time as judges, and told them that he had found his
 champion ready.  Then by the commandment of the kings Sir Blamore
 de Ganis and Sir Tristram were sent for to hear the charge.  And
 when they were come before the judges there were many kings and
 knights beheld Sir Tristram, and much speech they had of him
 because that he slew Sir Marhaus, the good knight, and because he
 for-jousted Sir Palamides the good knight.  So when they had
 taken their charge they withdrew them to make them ready to do
 battle.
 
 Then said Sir Bleoberis unto his brother, Sir Blamore:  Fair dear
 brother, remember of what kin we be come of, and what a man is
 Sir Launcelot du Lake, neither farther nor nearer but brother's
 children, and there was never none of our kin that ever was
 shamed in battle; and rather suffer death, brother, than to be
 shamed.  Brother, said Blamore, have ye no doubt of me, for I
 shall never shame none of my blood; howbeit I am sure that yonder
 knight is called a passing good knight as of his time one of the
 world, yet shall I never yield me, nor say the loath word: well
 may he happen to smite me down with his great might of chivalry,
 but rather shall he slay me than I shall yield me as recreant. 
 God speed you well, said Sir Bleoberis, for ye shall find him the
 mightiest knight that ever ye had ado withal, for I know him, for
 I have had ado with him.  God me speed, said Sir Blamore de
 Ganis; and therewith he took his horse at the one end of the
 lists, and Sir Tristram at the other end of the lists, and so
 they feutred their spears and came together as it had been
 thunder; and there Sir Tristram through great might smote down
 Sir Blamore and his horse to the earth.  Then anon Sir Blamore
 avoided his horse and pulled out his sword and threw his shield
 afore him, and bade Sir Tristram alight:  For though an horse
 hath failed me, I trust to God the earth will not fail me.  And
 then Sir Tristram alighted, and dressed him unto battle; and
 there they lashed together strongly as racing and tracing,
 foining and dashing, many sad strokes, that the kings and knights
 had great &lt;316&gt;wonder that they might stand; for ever they fought
 like wood men, so that there was never knights seen fight more
 fiercely than they did; for Sir Blamore was so hasty that he
 would have no rest, that all men wondered that they had breath to
 stand on their feet; and all the place was bloody that they
 fought in.  And at the last, Sir Tristram smote Sir Blamore such
 a buffet upon the helm that he there fell down upon his side, and
 Sir Tristram stood and beheld him.
