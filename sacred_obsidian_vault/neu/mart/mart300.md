 CHAPTER LXIII
 
 Of the preparation of Sir Palomides and the two brethren
 that should fight with him.
 
 
 WELL be ye found, said the knight to Palomides, for
 of all knights that be alive, except three, I had liefest
 have you.  The first is Sir Launcelot du Lake, and
 Sir Tristram de Liones, the third is my nigh cousin,
 Sir Lamorak de Galis.  And I am brother unto King
 Hermance that is dead, and my name is Sir Hermind.
 Ye say well, said Sir Palomides, and ye shall see how I
 shall speed; and if I be there slain go ye to my lord Sir
 Launcelot, or else to my lord Sir Tristram, and pray them
 to revenge my death, for as for Sir Lamorak him shall ye
 never see in this world.  Alas, said Sir Hermind, how
 may that be?  He is slain, said Sir Palomides, by Sir
 Gawaine and his brethren.  So God me help, said Hermind,
 there was not one for one that slew him.  That is
 truth, said Sir Palomides, for they were four dangerous
 knights that slew him, as Sir Gawaine, Sir Agravaine, Sir
 Gaheris, and Sir Mordred, but Sir Gareth, the fifth
 brother was away, the best knight of them all.  And so
 Sir Palomides told Hermind all the manner, and how they
 slew Sir Lamorak all only by treason.
 
 So Sir Palomides took his ship, and arrived up at the
 Delectable Isle.  And in the meanwhile Sir Hermind that
 was the king's brother, he arrived up at the Red City, and
 there he told them how there was come a knight of King
 Arthur's to avenge King Hermance's death:  And his
 name is Sir Palomides, the good knight, that for the
 most part he followeth the beast Glatisant.  Then all the
 city made great joy, for mickle had they heard of Sir
 Palomides, and of his noble prowess.  So let they ordain
 a messenger, and sent unto the two brethren, and bade
 them to make them ready, for there was a knight come
 that would fight with them both.  So the messenger went
 unto them where they were at a castle there beside; and
 there he told them how there was a knight come of King
 Arthur's court to fight with them both at once.  He is
 welcome, said they; but tell us, we pray you, if it be Sir
 Launcelot or any of his blood?  He is none of that blood,
 said the messenger.  Then we care the less, said the two
 brethren, for with none of the blood of Sir Launcelot we
 keep not to have ado withal.  Wit ye well, said the
 messenger, that his name is Sir Palomides, that yet is
 unchristened, a noble knight.  Well, said they, an he be
 now unchristened he shall never be christened.  So they
 appointed to be at the city within two days.
 
 And when Sir Palomides was come to the city they
 made passing great joy of him, and then they beheld him,
 and saw that he was well made, cleanly and bigly, and
 unmaimed of his limbs, and neither too young nor too old.
 And so all the people praised him; and though he was
 not christened yet he believed in the best manner, and was
 full faithful and true of his promise, and well conditioned;
 and because he made his avow that he would never be
 christened unto the time that he had achieved the beast
 Glatisant, the which was a full wonderful beast, and a
 great signification; for Merlin prophesied much of that
 beast.  And also Sir Palomides avowed never to take full
 christendom unto the time that he had done seven battles
 within the lists.
 
 So within the third day there came to the city these
 two brethren, the one hight Helius, the other hight
 Helake, the which were men of great prowess; howbeit
 that they were false and full of treason, and but poor men
 born, yet were they noble knights of their hands.  And
 with them they brought forty knights, to that intent that
 they should be big enough for the Red City.  Thus came
 the two brethren with great bobaunce and pride, for they
 had put the Red City in fear and damage.  Then they
 were brought to the lists, and Sir Palomides came into the
 place and said thus:  Be ye the two brethren, Helius and
 Helake, that slew your king and lord, Sir Hermance, by
 felony and treason, for whom that I am come hither to
 revenge his death?  Wit thou well, said Sir Helius and
 Sir Helake, that we are the same knights that slew King
 Hermance; and wit thou well, Sir Palomides Saracen, that
 we shall handle thee so or thou depart that thou shalt
 wish that thou wert christened.  It may well be, said Sir
 Palomides, for yet I would not die or I were christened;
 and yet so am I not afeard of you both, but I trust to God
 that I shall die a better christian man than any of you
 both; and doubt ye not, said Sir Palomides, either ye or I
 shall be left dead in this place.
