 CHAPTER XXV
 
 How Sir Tristram and Isoud were in prison, and how he
 fought for her beauty, and smote of another lady's head.
 
 THUS as Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud were in prison, it happed
 a knight and a lady came unto them where they were, to cheer
 them.  I have marvel, said Tristram unto the knight and the lady,
 what is the cause the lord of this castle holdeth us in prison:
 it was never the custom of no &lt;320&gt;place of worship that ever I
 came in, when a knight and a lady asked harbour, and they to
 receive them, and after to destroy them that be his guests.  Sir,
 said the knight, this is the old custom of this castle, that when
 a knight cometh here he must needs fight with our lord, and he
 that is weaker must lose his head.  And when that is done, if his
 lady that he bringeth be fouler than our lord's wife, she must
 lose her head: and if she be fairer proved than is our lady, then
 shall the lady of this castle lose her head.  So God me help,
 said Sir Tristram, this is a foul custom and a shameful.  But one
 advantage have I, said Sir Tristram, I have a lady is fair
 enough, fairer saw I never in all my life-days, and I doubt not
 for lack of beauty she shall not lose her head; and rather than I
 should lose my head I will fight for it on a fair field. 
 Wherefore, sir knight, I pray you tell your lord that I will be
 ready as to-morn with my lady, and myself to do battle, if it be
 so I may have my horse and mine armour.  Sir, said that knight, I
 undertake that your desire shall be sped right well.  And then he
 said:  Take your rest, and look that ye be up betimes and make
 you ready and your lady, for ye shall want no thing that you
 behoveth.  And therewith he departed, and on the morn betimes
 that same knight came to Sir Tristram, and fetched him out and
 his lady, and brought him horse and armour that was his own, and
 bade him make him ready to the field, for all the estates and
 commons of that lordship were there ready to behold that battle
 and judgment.
 
 Then came Sir Breunor, the lord of that castle, with his lady in
 his hand, muffled, and asked Sir Tristram where was his lady: 
 For an thy lady be fairer than mine, with thy sword smite off my
 lady's head; and if my lady be fairer than thine, with my sword I
 must strike off her head.  And if I may win thee, yet shall thy
 lady be mine, and thou shalt lose thy head.  Sir, said Tristram,
 this is a foul custom and horrible; and rather than my lady
 should lose her head, yet had I liefer lose my head.  Nay, nay,
 said Sir Breunor, the ladies shall be first showed together, and
 the one shall have her judgment.  Nay, I &lt;321&gt;will not so, said
 Sir Tristram, for here is none that will give righteous judgment. 
 But I doubt not, said Sir Tristram, my lady is fairer than thine,
 and that will I prove and make good with my hand.  And whosomever
 he be that will say the contrary I will prove it on his head. 
 And therewith Sir Tristram showed La Beale Isoud, and turned her
 thrice about with his naked sword in his hand.  And when Sir
 Breunor saw that, he did the same wise turn his lady.  But when
 Sir Breunor beheld La Beale Isoud, him thought he saw never a
 fairer lady, and then he dread his lady's head should be off. 
 And so all the people that were there present gave judgment that
 La Beale Isoud was the fairer lady and the better made.  How now,
 said Sir Tristram, meseemeth it were pity that my lady should
 lose her head, but because thou and she of long time have used
 this wicked custom, and by you both have many good knights and
 ladies been destroyed, for that cause it were no loss to destroy
 you both.  So God me help, said Sir Breunor, for to say the
 sooth, thy lady is fairer than mine, and that me sore repenteth. 
 And so I hear the people privily say, for of all women I saw none
 so fair; and therefore, an thou wilt slay my lady, I doubt not
 but I shall slay thee and have thy lady.  Thou shalt win her,
 said Sir Tristram, as dear as ever knight won lady.  And because
 of thine own judgment, as thou wouldst have done to my lady if
 that she had been fouler, and because of the evil custom, give me
 thy lady, said Sir Tristram.  And therewithal Sir Tristram strode
 unto him and took his lady from him, and with an awk stroke he
 smote off her head clean.  Well, knight, said Sir Breunor, now
 hast thou done me a despite; [*8]now take thine horse: sithen I
 am ladyless I will win thy lady an I may.
