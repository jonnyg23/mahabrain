 CHAPTER XVII
 
 How Sir Galahad met with Sir Launcelot and Sir Percivale,
 and smote them down, and departed from them.
 
 So when Sir Galahad was departed from the Castle of
 Maidens he rode till he came to a waste forest, and
 there he met with Sir Launcelot and Sir Percivale, but
 they knew him not, for he was new disguised.  Right so
 Sir Launcelot, his father, dressed his spear and brake it
 upon Sir Galahad, and Galahad smote him so again
 that he smote down horse and man.  And then he
 drew his sword, and dressed him unto Sir Percivale, and
 smote him so on the helm, that it rove to the coif of
 steel; and had not the sword swerved Sir Percivale had
 been slain, and with the stroke he fell out of his saddle.
 This jousts was done to-fore the hermitage where a
 recluse dwelled.  And when she saw Sir Galahad ride,
 she said:  God be with thee, best knight of the world.
 Ah certes, said she, all aloud that Launcelot and Percivale
 might hear it:  An yonder two knights had known thee
 as well as I do they would not have encountered with
 thee.  Then Sir Galahad heard her say so he was adread
 to be known: therewith he smote his horse with his
 spurs and rode a great pace froward them.  Then
 perceived they both that he was Galahad; and up they
 gat on their horses, and rode fast after him, but in a
 while he was out of their sight.  And then they turned
 again with heavy cheer.  Let us spere some tidings,
 said Percivale, at yonder recluse.  Do as ye list, said Sir
 Launcelot.
 
 When Sir Percivale came to the recluse she knew him
 well enough, and Sir Launcelot both.  But Sir Launcelot
 rode overthwart and endlong in a wild forest, and held
 no path but as wild adventure led him.  And at the last
 he came to a stony cross which departed two ways in
 waste land; and by the cross was a stone that was of
 marble, but it was so dark that Sir Launcelot might
 not wit what it was.  Then Sir Launcelot looked by
 him, and saw an old chapel, and there he weened to
 have found people; and Sir Launcelot tied his horse till
 a tree, and there he did off his shield and hung it upon
 a tree, and then went to the chapel door, and found
 it waste and broken.  And within he found a fair altar,
 full richly arrayed with cloth of clean silk, and there
 stood a fair clean candlestick, which bare six great
 candles, and the candlestick was of silver.  And when
 Sir Launcelot saw this light he had great will for to enter
 into the chapel, but he could find no place where he
 might enter; then was he passing heavy and dismayed.
 Then he returned and came to his horse and did off his
 saddle and bridle, and let him pasture, and unlaced his
 helm, and ungirt his sword, and laid him down to sleep
 upon his shield to-fore the cross.
