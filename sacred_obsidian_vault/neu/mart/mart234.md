 CHAPTER XLI
 
 How Sir Dinadan rescued a lady from Sir Breuse Saunce
 Pite, and how Sir Tristram received a shield of Morgan le Fay.
 
 SO as Sir Dinadan rode by a well he found a lady making great
 dole.  What aileth you? said Sir Dinadan.  Sir knight, said the
 lady, I am the wofullest lady of the world, for within these five
 days here came a knight called Sir Breuse Saunce Pite, and he
 slew mine own brother, and ever since he hath kept me at his own
 will, and of all men in the world I hate him most; and therefore
 I require you of knighthood to avenge me, for he will not tarry,
 but be here anon.  Let him come, said Sir Dinadan, and because of
 honour of all women I will do my part.  With this came Sir
 Breuse, and when he saw a knight with his lady he was wood wroth. 
 And then he said:  Sir knight, keep thee from me.  So they
 hurtled together as thunder, and either smote other passing sore,
 but Sir Dinadan put him through the shoulder a grievous wound,
 and or ever Sir Dinadan might turn him Sir Breuse was gone and
 fled.  Then the lady prayed him to bring her to a castle there
 beside but four mile thence; and so Sir Dinadan brought her
 there, and she was welcome, for the lord of that castle was her
 uncle; and so Sir Dinadan rode his way upon his adventure.
 
 Now turn we this tale unto Sir Tristram, that by adventure he
 came to a castle to ask lodging, wherein was Queen Morgan le Fay;
 and so when Sir Tristram was let into that castle he had good
 cheer all that night.  &lt;428&gt;And upon the morn when he would have
 departed the queen said:  Wit ye well ye shall not depart
 lightly, for ye are here as a prisoner.  Jesu defend! said Sir
 Tristram, for I was but late a prisoner.  Fair knight, said the
 queen, ye shall abide with me till that I wit what ye are and
 from whence ye come.  And ever the queen would set Sir Tristram
 on her own side, and her paramour on the other side.  And ever
 Queen Morgan would behold Sir Tristram, and thereat the knight
 was jealous, and was in will suddenly to have run upon Sir
 Tristram with a sword, but he left it for shame.  Then the queen
 said to Sir Tristram:  Tell me thy name, and I shall suffer you
 to depart when ye will.  Upon that covenant I tell you my name is
 Sir Tristram de Liones.  Ah, said Morgan le Fay, an I had wist
 that, thou shouldst not have departed so soon as thou shalt.  But
 sithen I have made a promise I will hold it, with that thou wilt
 promise me to bear upon thee a shield that I shall deliver thee,
 unto the castle of the Hard Rock, where King Arthur had cried a
 great tournament, and there I pray you that ye will be, and to do
 for me as much deeds of arms as ye may do.  For at the Castle of
 Maidens, Sir Tristram, ye did marvellous deeds of arms as ever I
 heard knight do.  Madam, said Sir Tristram, let me see the shield
 that I shall bear.  Then the shield was brought forth, and the
 field was goldish, with a king and a queen therein painted, and a
 knight standing above them, [one foot] upon the king's head, and
 the other upon the queen's.  Madam, said Sir Tristram, this is a
 fair shield and a mighty; but what signifieth this king and this
 queen, and the knight standing upon both their heads?  I shall
 tell you, said Morgan le Fay, it signifieth King Arthur and Queen
 Guenever, and a knight who holdeth them both in bondage and in
 servage.  Who is that knight? said Sir Tristram.  That shall ye
 not wit as at this time, said the queen.  But as the French book
 saith, Queen Morgan loved Sir Launcelot best, and ever she
 desired him, and he would never love her nor do nothing at her
 request, and therefore she held many knights together for to have
 taken him by strength.  &lt;429&gt;And because she deemed that Sir
 Launcelot loved Queen Guenever paramour, and she him again,
 therefore Queen Morgan le Fay ordained that shield to put Sir
 Launcelot to a rebuke, to that intent that King Arthur might
 understand the love between them.  Then Sir Tristram took that
 shield and promised her to bear it at the tournament at the
 Castle of the Hard Rock.  But Sir Tristram knew not that that
 shield was ordained against Sir Launcelot, but afterward he knew
 it.
