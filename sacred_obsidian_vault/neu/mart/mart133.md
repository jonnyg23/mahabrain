 CHAPTER XV
 
 How the damosel and Beaumains came to the siege; and came
 to a sycamore tree, and there Beaumains blew a horn,
 and then the Knight of the Red Launds came to fight with him.
 
 NOW leave we the knight and the dwarf, and speak we of Beaumains,
 that all night lay in the hermitage; and upon the morn he and the
 damosel Linet heard their mass and brake their fast.  And then
 they took their horses and rode throughout a fair forest; and
 then they came to a plain, and saw where were many pavilions and
 tents, and a fair castle, and there was much smoke and great
 noise; and when they came near the siege Sir Beaumains espied
 upon great trees, as he rode, how there hung full goodly armed
 knights by the neck, and their shields about their necks with
 their swords, and gilt spurs upon their heels, and so there hung
 nigh a forty knights shamefully with full rich arms.
 
 Then Sir Beaumains abated his countenance and said, What meaneth
 this?  Fair sir, said the damosel, abate not your cheer for all
 this sight, for ye must courage yourself, or else ye be all
 shent, for all these knights came hither to this siege to rescue
 my sister Dame Lionesse, and when the Red Knight of the Red
 Launds had overcome them, he put them to this shameful death
 without mercy and pity.  And in the same wise he will serve you
 but if you quit you the better.
 
 Now Jesu defend me, said Beaumains, from such a villainous death
 and shenship of arms.  For rather than I should so be faren
 withal, I would rather be slain manly in plain battle.  So were
 ye better, said the damosel; for trust not, in him is no
 courtesy, but all goeth to the death or shameful murder, and that
 is pity, for he is a full likely man, well made of body, and a
 full noble knight of prowess, and a lord of great lands and
 possessions.  Truly, &lt;236&gt;said Beaumains, he may well be a good
 knight, but he useth shameful customs, and it is marvel that he
 endureth so long that none of the noble knights of my lord
 Arthur's have not dealt with him.
 
 And then they rode to the dykes, and saw them double dyked with
 full warlike walls; and there were lodged many great lords nigh
 the walls; and there was great noise of minstrelsy; and the sea
 beat upon the one side of the walls, where were many ships and
 mariners' noise with ``hale and how.''  And also there was fast
 by a sycamore tree, and there hung an horn, the greatest that
 ever they saw, of an elephant's bone; and this Knight of the Red
 Launds had hanged it up there, that if there came any errant-
 knight, he must blow that horn, and then will he make him ready
 and come to him to do battle.  But, sir, I pray you, said the
 damosel Linet, blow ye not the horn till it be high noon, for now
 it is about prime, and now increaseth his might, that as men say
 he hath seven men's strength.  Ah, fie for shame, fair damosel,
 say ye never so more to me; for, an he were as good a knight as
 ever was, I shall never fail him in his most might, for either I
 will win worship worshipfully, or die knightly in the field.  And
 therewith he spurred his horse straight to the sycamore tree, and
 blew so the horn eagerly that all the siege and the castle rang
 thereof.  And then there leapt out knights out of their tents and
 pavilions, and they within the castle looked over the walls and
 out at windows.
 
 Then the Red Knight of the Red Launds armed him hastily, and two
 barons set on his spurs upon his heels, and all was blood red,
 his armour, spear and shield.  And an earl buckled his helm upon
 his head, and then they brought him a red spear and a red steed,
 and so he rode into a little vale under the castle, that all that
 were in the castle and at the siege might behold the battle.
