 CHAPTER XIX
 How Beaumains came to the lady, and when he came to the
 castle the gates were closed against him, and of the
 words that the lady said to him.
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Beaumains that desired of Linet that he
 might see her sister, his lady.  Sir, she said, I would fain ye
 saw her.  Then Sir Beaumains all armed him, and took his horse
 and his spear, and rode straight unto the castle.  And when he
 came to the gate he found there many men armed, and pulled up the
 drawbridge and drew the port close.
 
 Then marvelled he why they would not suffer him to enter.  And
 then he looked up to the window; and there he saw the fair
 Lionesse that said on high:  Go thy way, Sir Beaumains, for as
 yet thou shalt not have wholly my love, unto the time that thou
 be called one of the number of the worthy knights.  And therefore
 go labour in worship this twelvemonth, and then thou shalt hear
 new tidings.  Alas, fair lady, said Beaumains, I have not
 deserved that ye should show me this strangeness, and I had
 weened that I should have right good cheer with you, &lt;243&gt;and
 unto my power I have deserved thank, and well I am sure I have
 bought your love with part of the best blood within my body. 
 Fair courteous knight, said Dame Lionesse, be not displeased nor
 over-hasty; for wit you well your great travail nor good love
 shall not be lost, for I consider your great travail and labour,
 your bounty and your goodness as me ought to do.  And therefore
 go on your way, and look that ye be of good comfort, for all
 shall be for your worship and for the best, and perdy a
 twelvemonth will soon be done, and trust me, fair knight, I shall
 be true to you, and never to betray you, but to my death I shall
 love you and none other.  And therewithal she turned her from the
 window, and Sir Beaumains rode awayward from the castle, making
 great dole, and so he rode here and there and wist not where he
 rode, till it was dark night.  And then it happened him to come
 to a poor man's house, and there he was harboured all that night.
 
 But Sir Beaumains had no rest, but wallowed and writhed for the
 love of the lady of the castle.  And so upon the morrow he took
 his horse and rode until underne, and then he came to a broad
 water, and thereby was a great lodge, and there he alighted to
 sleep and laid his head upon the shield, and betook his horse to
 the dwarf, and commanded him to watch all night.
 
 Now turn we to the lady of the same castle, that thought much
 upon Beaumains, and then she called unto her Sir Gringamore her
 brother, and prayed him in all manner, as he loved her heartily,
 that he would ride after Sir Beaumains:  And ever have ye wait
 upon him till ye may find him sleeping, for I am sure in his
 heaviness he will alight down in some place, and lie him down to
 sleep; and therefore have ye your wait upon him, and in the
 priviest manner ye can, take his dwarf, and go ye your way with
 him as fast as ever ye may or Sir Beaumains awake.  For my sister
 Linet telleth me that he can tell of what kindred he is come, and
 what is his right name.  And the meanwhile I and my sister will
 ride unto your castle to await when ye bring with you the dwarf. 
 And then when ye &lt;244&gt;have brought him unto your castle, I will
 have him in examination myself.  Unto the time that I know what
 is his right name, and of what kindred he is come, shall I never
 be merry at my heart.  Sister, said Sir Gringamore, all this
 shall be done after your intent.
 
 And so he rode all the other day and the night till that he found
 Sir Beaumains lying by a water, and his head upon his shield, for
 to sleep.  And then when he saw Sir Beaumains fast asleep, he
 came stilly stalking behind the dwarf, and plucked him fast under
 his arm, and so he rode away with him as fast as ever he might
 unto his own castle.  And this Sir Gringamore's arms were all
 black, and that to him longeth.  But ever as he rode with the
 dwarf toward his castle, he cried unto his lord and prayed him of
 help.  And therewith awoke Sir Beaumains, and up he leapt
 lightly, and saw where Sir Gringamore rode his way with the
 dwarf, and so Sir Gringamore rode out of his sight.
