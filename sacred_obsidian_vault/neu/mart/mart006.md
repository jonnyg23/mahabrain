 CHAPTER VII
 
 How King Arthur was crowned, and how he made officers.
 
 AND at the feast of Pentecost all manner of men assayed to pull
 at the sword that would assay; but none might prevail but Arthur,
 and pulled it out afore all the lords and commons that were
 there, wherefore all the commons cried at once, We will have
 Arthur unto our king, we will put him no more in delay, for we
 all see that it is God's will that he shall be our king, and who
 that holdeth against it, we will slay him.  And therewithal they
 kneeled at once, both rich and poor, and cried Arthur mercy
 because they had delayed him so long, and Arthur forgave them,
 and took the sword between both his hands, and offered it upon
 the altar where the Archbishop was, and so was he made knight of
 the best man that was there.  And so anon was the coronation
 made.  And there was he sworn unto his lords and the commons for
 to be a true king, to stand with true justice from thenceforth
 the days of this life.  Also then he made all lords that held of
 the crown to come in, and to do service as they ought to do.  And
 many complaints were made unto Sir Arthur of great wrongs that
 were done since the death of King Uther, of many lands that were
 bereaved lords, knights, ladies, and gentlemen.  Wherefore King
 Arthur made the lands to be given again unto them that owned
 them.
 
 When this was done, that the king had stablished all the
 countries about London, then he let make Sir Kay seneschal of
 England; and Sir Baudwin of Britain was made constable; and Sir
 Ulfius was made chamberlain; and Sir Brastias was made warden to
 wait upon the north from Trent forwards, for it was that time the
 most party &lt;12&gt;the king's enemies.  But within few years after
 Arthur won all the north, Scotland, and all that were under their
 obeissance.  Also Wales, a part of it, held against Arthur, but
 he overcame them all, as he did the remnant, through the noble
 prowess of himself and his knights of the Round Table.
