 CHAPTER XXV
 
 How Sir Tristram jousted with Sir Kay and Sir Sagramore
 le Desirous, and how Sir Gawaine turned Sir Tristram
 from Morgan le Fay.
 
 BUT anon as the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, heard of the shield
 of Cornwall, then wist he well that it was Sir Tristram that
 fought with his enemies.  And then Sir Launcelot praised Sir
 Tristram, and called him the man of most worship in the world. 
 So there was a knight in that priory that hight Pellinore, and he
 desired to wit the name of Sir Tristram, but in no wise he could
 not; and so Sir Tristram departed and left Sir Dinadan in the
 priory, for he was so weary and so sore bruised that he might not
 ride.  Then this knight, Sir Pellinore, said to Sir Dinadan: 
 Sithen that ye will not tell me that knight's name I will ride
 after him and make him to tell me his name, or he shall die
 therefore.  Beware, sir knight, said Sir Dinadan, for an ye
 follow him ye shall repent it.  So that knight, Sir Pellinore,
 rode after Sir Tristram and required him of jousts.  Then Sir
 Tristram smote him down and wounded him through the shoulder, and
 so he passed on his way.  And on the next day following Sir
 Tristram met with &lt;395&gt;pursuivants, and they told him that there
 was made a great cry of tournament between King Carados of
 Scotland and the King of North Wales, and either should joust
 against other at the Castle of Maidens; and these pursuivants
 sought all the country after the good knights, and in especial
 King Carados let make seeking for Sir Launcelot du Lake, and the
 King of Northgalis let seek after Sir Tristram de Liones.  And at
 that time Sir Tristram thought to be at that jousts; and so by
 adventure they met with Sir Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Sagramore
 le Desirous; and Sir Kay required Sir Tristram to joust, and Sir
 Tristram in a manner refused him, because he would not be hurt
 nor bruised against the great jousts that should be before the
 Castle of Maidens, and therefore thought to repose him and to
 rest him.  And alway Sir Kay cried:  Sir knight of Cornwall,
 joust with me, or else yield thee to me as recreant.  When Sir
 Tristram heard him say so he turned to him, and then Sir Kay
 refused him and turned his back.  Then Sir Tristram said:  As I
 find thee I shall take thee.  Then Sir Kay turned with evil will,
 and Sir Tristram smote Sir Kay down, and so he rode forth.
 
 Then Sir Sagramore le Desirous rode after Sir Tristram, and made
 him to joust with him, and there Sir Tristram smote down Sir
 Sagramore le Desirous from his horse, and rode his way; and the
 same day he met with a damosel that told him that he should win
 great worship of a knight adventurous that did much harm in all
 that country.  When Sir Tristram heard her say so, he was glad to
 go with her to win worship.  So Sir Tristram rode with that
 damosel a six mile, and then met him Sir Gawaine, and therewithal
 Sir Gawaine knew the damosel, that she was a damosel of Queen
 Morgan le Fay.  Then Sir Gawaine understood that she led that
 knight to some mischief.  Fair knight, said Sir Gawaine, whither
 ride you now with that damosel?  Sir, said Sir Tristram, I wot
 not whither I shall ride but as the damosel will lead me.  Sir,
 said Sir Gawaine, ye shall not ride with her, for she and her
 lady did never good, but ill.  And then Sir Gawaine pulled out
 his sword and said:  Damosel, but if thou tell me anon &lt;396&gt;for
 what cause thou leadest this knight with thee thou shalt die for
 it right anon:  I know all your lady's treason, and yours. 
 Mercy, Sir Gawaine, she said, and if ye will save my life I will
 tell you.  Say on, said Sir Gawaine, and thou shalt have thy
 life.  Sir, she said, Queen Morgan le Fay, my lady, hath ordained
 a thirty ladies to seek and espy after Sir Launcelot or Sir
 Tristram, and by the trains of these ladies, who that may first
 meet any of these two knights they should turn them unto Morgan
 le Fay's castle, saying that they should do deeds of worship; and
 if any of the two knights came there, there be thirty knights
 lying and watching in a tower to wait upon Sir Launcelot or upon
 Sir Tristram.  Fie for shame, said Sir Gawaine, that ever such
 false treason should be wrought or used in a queen, and a king's
 sister, and a king and queen's daughter.
