 CHAPTER VIII
 
 How the brother of the knight that was slain met with
 Beaumains, and fought with Beaumains till he was yielden.
 
 THUS as they rode together, they saw a knight come driving by
 them all in green, both his horse and his harness; and when he
 came nigh the damosel, he asked her, Is that my brother the Black
 Knight that ye have brought with you?  Nay, nay, she said, this
 unhappy kitchen knave hath slain your brother through
 unhappiness.  Alas, said the Green Knight, that is great pity,
 that so noble a knight as he was should so unhappily be slain,
 and namely of a knave's hand, as ye say that he is.  Ah! traitor,
 said the Green Knight, thou shalt die for slaying of my brother;
 he was a full noble knight, and his name was Sir Perard.  I defy
 thee, said Beaumains, for I let thee wit I slew him knightly and
 not shamefully.
 
 Therewithal the Green Knight rode unto an horn that was green,
 and it hung upon a thorn, and there he blew three deadly motes,
 and there came two damosels and armed him lightly.  And then he
 took a great horse, and a green shield and a green spear.  And
 then they ran together with all their mights, and brake their
 spears unto their hands.  And then they drew their swords, and
 gave many sad strokes, and either of them wounded other full ill. 
 And at the last, at an overthwart, Beaumains with his horse
 struck the Green Knight's horse upon the side, that he fell to
 the earth.  And then the Green Knight avoided his horse lightly,
 and dressed him upon foot.  That saw Beaumains, and therewithal
 he alighted, and they rushed together like two mighty kemps a
 long while, and sore they bled both.  With that came the damosel,
 and said, My lord the Green Knight, why for shame stand ye so
 long fighting with the kitchen knave?  Alas, it is shame that
 ever ye were made knight, to see such a lad to match &lt;222&gt;such a
 knight, as the weed overgrew the corn.  Therewith the Green
 Knight was ashamed, and therewithal he gave a great stroke of
 might, and clave his shield through.  When Beaumains saw his
 shield cloven asunder he was a little ashamed of that stroke and
 of her language; and then he gave him such a buffet upon the helm
 that he fell on his knees.  And so suddenly Beaumains pulled him
 upon the ground grovelling.  And then the Green Knight cried him
 mercy, and yielded him unto Sir Beaumains, and prayed him to slay
 him not.  All is in vain, said Beaumains, for thou shalt die but
 if this damosel that came with me pray me to save thy life.  And
 therewithal he unlaced his helm like as he would slay him.  Fie
 upon thee, false kitchen page, I will never pray thee to save his
 life, for I will never be so much in thy danger.  Then shall he
 die, said Beaumains.  Not so hardy, thou bawdy knave, said the
 damosel, that thou slay him.  Alas, said the Green Knight, suffer
 me not to die for a fair word may save me.  Fair knight, said the
 Green Knight, save my life, and I will forgive thee the death of
 my brother, and for ever to become thy man, and thirty knights
 that hold of me for ever shall do you service.  In the devil's
 name, said the damosel, that such a bawdy kitchen knave should
 have thee and thirty knights' service.
 
 Sir knight, said Beaumains, all this availeth thee not, but if my
 damosel speak with me for thy life.  And therewithal he made a
 semblant to slay him.  Let be, said the damosel, thou bawdy
 knave; slay him not, for an thou do thou shalt repent it. 
 Damosel, said Beaumains, your charge is to me a pleasure, and at
 your commandment his life shall be saved, and else not.  Then he
 said, Sir knight with the green arms, I release thee quit at this
 damosel's request, for I will not make her wroth, I will fulfil
 all that she chargeth me.  And then the Green Knight kneeled
 down, and did him homage with his sword.  Then said the damosel,
 Me repenteth, Green Knight, of your damage, and of your brother's
 death, the Black Knight, for of your help I had great mister, for
 I dread me sore to pass this forest.  Nay, dread you not, said
 the &lt;223&gt;Green Knight, for ye shall lodge with me this night, and
 to-morn I shall help you through this forest.  So they took their
 horses and rode to his manor, which was fast there beside.
