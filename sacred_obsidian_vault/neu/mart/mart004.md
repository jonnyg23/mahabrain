 CHAPTER V
 
 How Arthur was chosen king, and of wonders and marvels
 of a sword taken out of a stone by the said Arthur.
 
 THEN stood the realm in great jeopardy long while, for every lord
 that was mighty of men made him strong, and many weened to have
 been king.  Then Merlin went to the Archbishop of Canterbury, and
 counselled him for to send for all the lords of the realm, and
 all the gentlemen of arms, that they should to London come by
 Christmas, upon pain of cursing; and for this cause, that Jesus,
 that was born on that night, that he would of his great mercy
 show some miracle, as he was come to be king of mankind, for to
 show some miracle who should be rightwise king of this realm.  So
 the Archbishop, by the advice of Merlin, sent for all the lords
 and gentlemen of arms that they should come by Christmas even
 unto London.  And many of them made them clean of their life,
 that their prayer might be the more acceptable unto God.  So in
 the greatest church of London, whether it were Paul's or not the
 French book maketh no mention, all the estates were long or day
 in the church for to pray.  And when matins and the first mass
 was done, there was seen in the churchyard, against the high
 altar, a great stone four square, like unto a marble stone; and
 in midst thereof was like an anvil of steel a foot on high, and
 therein stuck a fair sword naked by the point, and letters there
 were written in gold about the sword that said thus:--Whoso
 pulleth out this sword of this stone and anvil, is rightwise king
 born of all England.  Then the people marvelled, and told it to
 the Archbishop.  I command, said the Archbishop, that ye keep you
 within your church and pray unto God still, that no man touch the
 sword till the high mass be all done.  So when all masses were
 done all the lords went to behold the stone and the sword.  And
 when they saw the scripture some assayed, such as &lt;8&gt;would have
 been king.  But none might stir the sword nor move it.  He is not
 here, said the Archbishop, that shall achieve the sword, but
 doubt not God will make him known.  But this is my counsel, said
 the Archbishop, that we let purvey ten knights, men of good fame,
 and they to keep this sword.  So it was ordained, and then there
 was made a cry, that every man should assay that would, for to
 win the sword.  And upon New Year's Day the barons let make a
 jousts and a tournament, that all knights that would joust or
 tourney there might play, and all this was ordained for to keep
 the lords together and the commons, for the Archbishop trusted
 that God would make him known that should win the sword.
 
 So upon New Year's Day, when the service was done, the barons
 rode unto the field, some to joust and some to tourney, and so it
 happened that Sir Ector, that had great livelihood about London,
 rode unto the jousts, and with him rode Sir Kay his son, and
 young Arthur that was his nourished brother; and Sir Kay was made
 knight at All Hallowmass afore.  So as they rode to the jousts-
 ward, Sir Kay lost his sword, for he had left it at his father's
 lodging, and so he prayed young Arthur for to ride for his sword. 
 I will well, said Arthur, and rode fast after the sword, and when
 he came home, the lady and all were out to see the jousting. 
 Then was Arthur wroth, and said to himself, I will ride to the
 churchyard, and take the sword with me that sticketh in the
 stone, for my brother Sir Kay shall not be without a sword this
 day.  So when he came to the churchyard, Sir Arthur alighted and
 tied his horse to the stile, and so he went to the tent, and
 found no knights there, for they were at the jousting.  And so he
 handled the sword by the handles, and lightly and fiercely pulled
 it out of the stone, and took his horse and rode his way until he
 came to his brother Sir Kay, and delivered him the sword.  And as
 soon as Sir Kay saw the sword, he wist well it was the sword of
 the stone, and so he rode to his father Sir Ector, and said: Sir,
 lo here is the sword of the stone, wherefore I must be king of
 this land.  When Sir Ector beheld the sword, he &lt;9 CH. VI  HOW HE
 PULLED OUT THE SWORD&gt;returned again and came to the church, and
 there they alighted all three, and went into the church.  And
 anon he made Sir Kay swear upon a book how he came to that sword. 
 Sir, said Sir Kay, by my brother Arthur, for he brought it to me. 
 How gat ye this sword? said Sir Ector to Arthur.  Sir, I will
 tell you.  When I came home for my brother's sword, I found
 nobody at home to deliver me his sword; and so I thought my
 brother Sir Kay should not be swordless, and so I came hither
 eagerly and pulled it out of the stone without any pain.  Found
 ye any knights about this sword? said Sir Ector.  Nay, said
 Arthur.  Now, said Sir Ector to Arthur, I understand ye must be
 king of this land.  Wherefore I, said Arthur, and for what cause? 
 Sir, said Ector, for God will have it so; for there should never
 man have drawn out this sword, but he that shall be rightwise
 king of this land.  Now let me see whether ye can put the sword
 there as it was, and pull it out again.  That is no mastery, said
 Arthur, and so he put it in the stone; wherewithal Sir Ector
 assayed to pull out the sword and failed.
