 CHAPTER X
 
 How Galahad departed with the shield, and how King
 Evelake had received the shield of Joseph of Aramathie.
 
 
 SIR GALAHAD, said the squire, that knight that wounded
 Bagdemagus sendeth you greeting, and bade that ye should
 bear this shield, wherethrough great adventures should
 befall.  Now blessed be God and fortune, said Galahad.
 And then he asked his arms, and mounted upon his horse,
 and hung the white shield about his neck, and commended
 them unto God.  And Sir Uwaine said he would bear
 him fellowship if it pleased him.  Sir, said Galahad, that
 may ye not, for I must go alone, save this squire shall
 bear me fellowship: and so departed Uwaine.
 
 Then within a while came Galahad thereas the White
 Knight abode him by the hermitage, and everych saluted
 other courteously.  Sir, said Galahad, by this shield be
 many marvels fallen.  Sir, said the knight, it befell after
 the passion of our Lord Jesu Christ thirty-two year, that
 Joseph of Aramathie, the gentle knight, the which took
 down our Lord off the holy Cross, at that time he
 departed from Jerusalem with a great party of his kindred
 with him.  And so he laboured till that they came to a
 city that hight Sarras.  And at that same hour that Joseph
 came to Sarras there was a king that hight Evelake, that
 had great war against the Saracens, and in especial against
 one Saracen, the which was King Evelake's cousin, a rich
 king and a mighty, which marched nigh this land, and his
 name was called Tolleme la Feintes.  So on a day these
 two met to do battle.  Then Joseph, the son of Joseph of
 Aramathie, went to King Evelake and told him he should
 be discomfit and slain, but if he left his belief of the old
 law and believed upon the new law.  And then there he
 shewed him the right belief of the Holy Trinity, to the
 which he agreed unto with all his heart; and there this
 shield was made for King Evelake, in the name of Him
 that died upon the Cross.  And then through his good
 belief he had the better of King Tolleme.  For when
 Evelake was in the battle there was a cloth set afore the
 shield, and when he was in the greatest peril he let put
 away the cloth, and then his enemies saw a figure of a
 man on the Cross, wherethrough they all were discomfit.
 And so it befell that a man of King Evelake's was smitten
 his hand off, and bare that hand in his other hand; and
 Joseph called that man unto him and bade him go with
 good devotion touch the Cross.  And as soon as that man
 had touched the Cross with his hand it was as whole as
 ever it was to-fore.  Then soon after there fell a great
 marvel, that the cross of the shield at one time vanished
 away that no man wist where it became.  And then King
 Evelake was baptised, and for the most part all the people
 of that city.  So, soon after Joseph would depart, and
 King Evelake would go with him, whether he wold or
 nold.  And so by fortune they came into this land, that
 at that time was called Great Britain; and there they
 found a great felon paynim, that put Joseph into prison.
 And so by fortune tidings came unto a worthy man that
 hight Mondrames, and he assembled all his people for the
 great renown he had heard of Joseph; and so he came
 into the land of Great Britain and disherited this felon
 paynim and consumed him, and therewith delivered Joseph
 out of prison.  And after that all the people were turned
 to the Christian faith.
