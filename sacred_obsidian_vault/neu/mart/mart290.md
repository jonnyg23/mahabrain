 CHAPTER LIII
 
 How by the counsel of La Beale Isoud Sir Tristram rode
 armed, and how he met with Sir Palomides.
 
 
 SO on a day La Beale Isoud said unto Sir Tristram:  I
 marvel me much, said she, that ye remember not yourself,
 how ye be here in a strange country, and here be many
 perilous knights; and well ye wot that King Mark is full
 of treason; and that ye will ride thus to chase and to hunt
 unarmed ye might be destroyed.  My fair lady and my
 love, I cry you mercy, I will no more do so.  So then Sir
 Tristram rode daily a-hunting armed, and his men bearing
 his shield and his spear.  So on a day a little afore the
 month of May, Sir Tristram chased an hart passing
 eagerly, and so the hart passed by a fair well.  And then
 Sir Tristram alighted and put off his helm to drink of that
 bubbly water.  Right so he heard and saw the Questing
 Beast come to the well.  When Sir Tristram saw that
 beast he put on his helm, for he deemed he should hear of
 Sir Palomides, for that beast was his quest.  Right so Sir
 Tristram saw where came a knight armed, upon a noble
 courser, and he saluted him, and they spake of many
 things; and this knight's name was Breuse Saunce Pit<e>.
 And right so withal there came unto them the noble
 knight Sir Palomides, and either saluted other, and spake
 fair to other.
 
 Fair knights, said Sir Palomides, I can tell you tidings.
 What is that? said those knights.  Sirs, wit ye well that
 King Mark is put in prison by his own knights, and all
 was for love of Sir Tristram; for King Mark had put Sir
 Tristram twice in prison, and once Sir Percivale delivered
 the noble knight Sir Tristram out of prison.  And at the
 last time Queen La Beale Isoud delivered him, and went
 clearly away with him into this realm; and all this while
 King Mark, the false traitor, is in prison.  Is this truth?
 said Palomides; then shall we hastily hear of Sir Tristram.
 And as for to say that I love La Beale Isoud paramours,
 I dare make good that I do, and that she hath my service
 above all other ladies, and shall have the term of my life.
 
 And right so as they stood talking they saw afore them
 where came a knight all armed, on a great horse, and one
 of his men bare his shield, and the other his spear.  And
 anon as that knight espied them he gat his shield and his
 spear and dressed him to joust.  Fair fellows, said Sir
 Tristram, yonder is a knight will joust with us, let see
 which of us shall encounter with him, for I see well he is
 of the court of King Arthur.  It shall not be long or he
 be met withal, said Sir Palomides, for I found never no
 knight in my quest of this glasting beast, but an he would
 joust I never refused him.  As well may I, said Breuse
 Saunce Pit<e>, follow that beast as ye.  Then shall ye do
 battle with me, said Palomides.
 
 So Sir Palomides dressed him unto that other knight,
 Sir Bleoberis, that was a full noble knight, nigh kin unto
 Sir Launcelot.  And so they met so hard that Sir Palomides
 fell to the earth, horse and all.  Then Sir Bleoberis
 cried aloud and said thus:  Make thee ready thou false
 traitor knight, Breuse Saunce Pit<e>, for wit thou certainly
 I will have ado with thee to the utterance for the noble
 knights and ladies that thou hast falsely betrayed.  When
 this false knight and traitor, Breuse Saunce Pit<e>, heard
 him say so, he took his horse by the bridle and fled his
 way as fast as ever his horse might run, for sore he was of
 him afeard.  When Sir Bleoberis saw him flee he followed
 fast after, through thick and through thin.  And by
 fortune as Sir Breuse fled, he saw even afore him three
 knights of the Table Round, of the which the one hight
 Sir Ector de Maris, the other hight Sir Percivale de Galis,
 the third hight Sir Harry le Fise Lake, a good knight and
 an hardy.  And as for Sir Percivale, he was called that
 time of his time one of the best knights of the world,
 and the best assured.  When Breuse saw these knights he
 rode straight unto them, and cried unto them and prayed
 them of rescues.  What need have ye? said Sir Ector.
 Ah, fair knights, said Sir Breuse, here followeth me the
 most traitor knight, and most coward, and most of villainy;
 his name is Breuse Saunce Pit<e>, and if he may get me he
 will slay me without mercy and pity.  Abide with us, said
 Sir Percivale, and we shall warrant you.
 
 Then were they ware of Sir Bleoberis that came riding
 all that he might.  Then Sir Ector put himself forth to
 joust afore them all.  When Sir Bleoberis saw that they
 were four knights and he but himself, he stood in a doubt
 whether he would turn or hold his way.  Then he said to
 himself:  I am a knight of the Table Round, and rather
 than I should shame mine oath and my blood I will hold
 my way whatsoever fall thereof.  And then Sir Ector
 dressed his spear, and smote either other passing sore, but
 Sir Ector fell to the earth.  That saw Sir Percivale, and
 he dressed his horse toward him all that he might drive,
 but Sir Percivale had such a stroke that horse and man fell
 to the earth.  When Sir Harry saw that they were both to
 the earth then he said to himself:  Never was Breuse of
 such prowess.  So Sir Harry dressed his horse, and they
 met together so strongly that both the horses and knights
 fell to the earth, but Sir Bleoberis' horse began to recover
 again.  That saw Breuse and he came hurtling, and smote
 him over and over, and would have slain him as he lay on
 the ground.  Then Sir Harry le Fise Lake arose lightly,
 and took the bridle of Sir Breuse's horse, and said:
 Fie for shame! strike never a knight when he is at the
 earth, for this knight may be called no shameful knight of
 his deeds, for yet as men may see thereas he lieth on the
 ground he hath done worshipfully, and put to the worse
 passing good knights.  Therefore will I not let, said Sir
 Breuse.  Thou shalt not choose, said Sir Harry, as at this
 time.  Then when Sir Breuse saw that he might not choose
 nor have his will he spake fair.  Then Sir Harry let him
 go.  And then anon he made his horse to run over Sir
 Bleoberis, and rashed him to the earth like if he would
 have slain him.  When Sir Harry saw him do so villainously
 he cried:  Traitor knight, leave off for shame.  And
 as Sir Harry would have taken his horse to fight with Sir
 Breuse, then Sir Breuse ran upon him as he was half upon
 his horse, and smote him down, horse and man, to the
 earth, and had near slain Sir Harry, the good knight.
 That saw Sir Percivale, and then he cried:  Traitor knight
 what dost thou?  And when Sir Percivale was upon his
 horse Sir Breuse took his horse and fled all that ever he
 might, and Sir Percivale and Sir Harry followed after him
 fast, but ever the longer they chased the farther were they
 behind.
 
 Then they turned again and came to Sir Ector de Maris
 and to Sir Bleoberis.  Ah, fair knights, said Bleoberis, why
 have ye succoured that false knight and traitor?  Why
 said Sir Harry, what knight is he? for well I wot it is a
 false knight, said Sir Harry, and a coward and a felonious
 knight.  Sir, said Bleoberis, he is the most coward knight,
 and a devourer of ladies and a destroyer of good knights
 and especially of Arthur's.  What is your name? said Sir
 Ector.  My name is Sir Bleoberis de Ganis.  Alas, fair
 cousin, said Ector, forgive it me, for I am Sir Ector de
 Maris.  Then Sir Percivale and Sir Harry made great joy
 that they met with Bleoberis, but all they were heavy that
 Sir Breuse was escaped them, whereof they made great dole.
