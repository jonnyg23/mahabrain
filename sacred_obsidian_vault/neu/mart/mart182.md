 CHAPTER XXIX
 
 Of the wedding of King Mark to La Beale Isoud, and of
 Bragwaine her maid, and of Palamides.
 
 AND anon they were richly wedded with great noblesse.  But ever,
 as the French book saith, Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud loved
 ever together.  Then was there great jousts and great tourneying,
 and many lords and ladies were at that feast, and Sir Tristram
 was most praised of all other.  Thus dured the feast long, and
 after the feast was done, within a little while after, by the
 assent of two ladies that were with Queen Isoud, they ordained
 for hate and envy for to destroy Dame Bragwaine, that was maiden
 and lady unto La Beale Isoud; and she was sent into the forest
 for to fetch herbs, and there she was met, and bound feet and
 hand to a tree, and so she was bounden three days.  And by
 fortune, Sir Palamides found Dame Bragwaine, and there he
 delivered her from the death, and brought her to a nunnery there
 beside, for to be recovered.  When Isoud the queen missed her
 maiden, wit ye well she was right heavy as ever was any queen,
 for of all earthly women she loved her best: the cause was for
 she came with her out of her country.  And so upon a day Queen
 Isoud walked into the forest to put away her thoughts, and there
 she went herself unto a well and made great moan.  And suddenly
 there came Palamides to her, and had heard all her complaint, and
 said:  Madam Isoud, an ye will grant me my boon, I shall bring to
 you Dame Bragwaine safe and sound.  And the queen was so glad of
 his proffer that &lt;327&gt;suddenly unadvised she granted all his
 asking.  Well, Madam, said Palamides, I trust to your promise,
 and if ye will abide here half an hour I shall bring her to you. 
 I shall abide you, said La Beale Isoud.  And Sir Palamides rode
 forth his way to that nunnery, and lightly he came again with
 Dame Bragwaine; but by her good will she would not have come
 again, because for love of the queen she stood in adventure of
 her life.  Notwithstanding, half against her will, she went with
 Sir Palamides unto the queen.  And when the queen saw her she was
 passing glad.  Now, Madam, said Palamides, remember upon your
 promise, for I have fulfilled my promise.  Sir Palamides, said
 the queen, I wot not what is your desire, but I will that ye wit,
 howbeit I promised you largely, I thought none evil, nor I warn
 you none evil will I do.  Madam, said Sir Palamides, as at this
 time, ye shall not know my desire, but before my lord your
 husband there shall ye know that I will have my desire that ye
 have promised me.  And therewith the queen departed, and rode
 home to the king, and Sir Palamides rode after her.  And when Sir
 Palamides came before the king, he said:  Sir King, I require you
 as ye be a righteous king, that ye will judge me the right.  Tell
 me your cause, said the king, and ye shall have right.
