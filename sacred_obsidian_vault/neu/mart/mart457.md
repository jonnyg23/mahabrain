 CHAPTER III
 
 How Sir Launcelot had word how the queen was taken, and
 how Sir Meliagrance laid a bushment for Launcelot
 
 
 THEN by the queen's commandment they left battle, and
 dressed the wounded knights on horseback, some sitting,
 some overthwart their horses, that it was pity to behold
 them.  And then Sir Meliagrance charged the queen and
 all her knights that none of all her fellowship should
 depart from her; for full sore he dread Sir Launcelot du
 Lake, lest he should have any knowledging.  All this
 espied the queen, and privily she called unto her a child of
 her chamber that was swiftly horsed, to whom she said:
 Go thou, when thou seest thy time, and bear this ring unto
 Sir Launcelot du Lake, and pray him as he loveth me that
 he will see me and rescue me, if ever he will have joy of
 me; and spare not thy horse, said the queen, neither for
 water, neither for land.  So the child espied his time, and
 lightly he took his horse with the spurs, and departed as
 fast as he might.  And when Sir Meliagrance saw him so
 flee, he understood that it was by the queen's commandment
 for to warn Sir Launcelot.  Then they that were
 best horsed chased him and shot at him, but from them all
 the child went suddenly.  And then Sir Meliagrance said
 to the queen:  Madam, ye are about to betray me, but I
 shall ordain for Sir Launcelot that he shall not come lightly
 at you.  And then he rode with her, and they all, to his
 castle, in all the haste that they might.  And by the way
 Sir Meliagrance laid in an embushment the best archers
 that he might get in his country, to the number of thirty,
 to await upon Sir Launcelot, charging them that if they
 saw such a manner of knight come by the way upon a
 white horse, that in any wise they slay his horse, but in no
 manner of wise have not ado with him bodily, for he is
 over-hardy to be overcome.
 
 So this was done, and they were come to his castle, but
 in no wise the queen would never let none of the ten
 knights and her ladies out of her sight, but always they
 were in her presence; for the book saith, Sir Meliagrance
 durst make no masteries, for dread of Sir Launcelot, insomuch
 he deemed that he had warning.  So when the child
 was departed from the fellowship of Sir Meliagrance,
 within a while he came to Westminster, and anon he found
 Sir Launcelot.  And when he had told his message, and
 delivered him the queen's ring:  Alas, said Sir Launcelot,
 now I am shamed for ever, unless that I may rescue that
 noble lady from dishonour.  Then eagerly he asked his
 armour; and ever the child told Sir Launcelot how the
 ten knights fought marvellously, and how Sir Pelleas, and
 Sir Ironside, and Sir Brandiles, and Sir Persant of Inde,
 fought strongly, but namely Sir Pelleas, there might none
 withstand him; and how they all fought till at the last they
 were laid to the earth; and then the queen made appointment
 for to save their lives, and go with Sir Meliagrance.
 
 Alas, said Sir Launcelot, that most noble lady, that she
 should be so destroyed; I had liefer, said Sir Launcelot,
 than all France, that I had been there well armed.  So
 when Sir Launcelot was armed and upon his horse, he
 prayed the child of the queen's chamber to warn Sir
 Lavaine how suddenly he was departed, and for what cause.
 And pray him as he loveth me, that he will hie him after
 me, and that he stint not until he come to the castle where
 Sir Meliagrance abideth, or dwelleth; for there, said Sir
 Launcelot, he shall hear of me an I am a man living, and
 rescue the queen and the ten knights the which he traitorously
 hath taken, and that shall I prove upon his head, and
 all them that hold with him.
