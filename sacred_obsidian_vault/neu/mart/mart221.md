 CHAPTER XXVIII
 
 How Sir Tristram had a fall with Sir Palomides, and
 how Launcelot overthrew two knights.
 
 THEN they saw much people of the country salute Sir Palomides. 
 And within a while after there came a squire of the castle, that
 told Sir Pellounes that was lord of that castle, that a knight
 with a black shield had smitten down thirteen knights.  Fair
 brother, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides, let us cast upon us
 cloaks, and let us go see &lt;400&gt;the play.  Not so, said Sir
 Persides, we will not go like knaves thither, but we will ride
 like men and good knights to withstand our enemies.  So they
 armed them, and took their horses and great spears, and thither
 they went thereas many knights assayed themself before the
 tournament.  And anon Sir Palomides saw Sir Persides, and then he
 sent a squire unto him and said:  Go thou to the yonder knight
 with the green shield and therein a lion of gold, and say him I
 require him to joust with me, and tell him that my name is Sir
 Palomides.  When Sir Persides understood that request of Sir
 Palomides, he made him ready, and there anon they met together,
 but Sir Persides had a fall.  Then Sir Tristram dressed him to be
 revenged upon Sir Palomides, and that saw Sir Palomides that was
 ready and so was not Sir Tristram, and took him at an advantage
 and smote him over his horse's tail when he had no spear in his
 rest.  Then stert up Sir Tristram and took his horse lightly, and
 was wroth out of measure, and sore ashamed of that fall.  Then
 Sir Tristram sent unto Sir Palomides by Gouvernail, and prayed
 him to joust with him at his request.  Nay, said Sir Palomides,
 as at this time I will not joust with that knight, for I know him
 better than he weeneth.  And if he be wroth he may right it to-
 morn at the Castle of Maidens, where he may see me and many other
 knights.
 
 With that came Sir Dinadan, and when he saw Sir Tristram wroth he
 list not to jape.  Lo, said Sir Dinadan, here may a man prove, be
 a man never so good yet may he have a fall, and he was never so
 wise but he might be overseen, and he rideth well that never
 fell.  So Sir Tristram was passing wroth, and said to Sir
 Persides and to Sir Dinadan:  I will revenge me.  Right so as
 they stood talking there, there came by Sir Tristram a likely
 knight riding passing soberly and heavily with a black shield. 
 What knight is that? said Sir Tristram unto Sir Persides.  I know
 him well, said Sir Persides, for his name is Sir Briant of North
 Wales; so he passed on among other knights of North Wales.  And
 there came &lt;401&gt;in Sir Launcelot du Lake with a shield of the
 arms of Cornwall, and he sent a squire unto Sir Briant, and
 required him to joust with him.  Well, said Sir Briant, sithen I
 am required to joust I will do what I may; and there Sir
 Launcelot smote down Sir Briant from his horse a great fall.  And
 then Sir Tristram marvelled what knight he was that bare the
 shield of Cornwall.  Whatsoever he be, said Sir Dinadan, I
 warrant you he is of King Ban's blood, the which be knights of
 the most noble prowess in the world, for to account so many for
 so many.  Then there came two knights of Northgalis, that one
 hight Hew de la Montaine, and the other Sir Madok de la Montaine,
 and they challenged Sir Launcelot foot-hot.  Sir Launcelot not
 refusing them but made him ready, with one spear he smote them
 down both over their horses' croups; and so Sir Launcelot rode
 his way.  By the good lord, said Sir Tristram, he is a good
 knight that beareth the shield of Cornwall, and meseemeth he
 rideth in the best manner that ever I saw knight ride.
 
 Then the King of Northgalis rode unto Sir Palomides and prayed
 him heartily for his sake to joust with that knight that hath
 done us of Northgalis despite.  Sir, said Sir Palomides, I am
 full loath to have ado with that knight, and cause why is, for as
 to-morn the great tournament shall be; and therefore I will keep
 myself fresh by my will.  Nay, said the King of Northgalis, I
 pray you require him of jousts.  Sir, said Sir Palomides, I will
 joust at your request, and require that knight to joust with me,
 and often I have seen a man have a fall at his own request.
