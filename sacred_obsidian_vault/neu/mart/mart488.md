 CHAPTER XXI
 
 How Sir Launcelot and Sir Gawaine did battle together,
 and how Sir Gawaine was overthrown and hurt
 
 
 THEN Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot departed a great
 way asunder, and then they came together with all their
 horses' might as they might run, and either smote other
 in midst of their shields; but the knights were so strong,
 and their spears so big, that their horses might not endure
 their buffets, and so their horses fell to the earth; and
 then they avoided their horses, and dressed their shields
 afore them.  Then they stood together and gave many sad
 strokes on divers places of their bodies, that the blood
 brast out on many sides and places.  Then had Sir
 Gawaine such a grace and gift that an holy man had
 given to him, that every day in the year, from underne
 till high noon, his might increased those three hours as
 much as thrice his strength, and that caused Sir Gawaine
 to win great honour.  And for his sake King Arthur
 made an ordinance, that all manner of battles for any
 quarrels that should be done afore King Arthur should
 begin at underne; and all was done for Sir Gawaine's love,
 that by likelihood, if Sir Gawaine were on the one part,
 he should have the better in battle while his strength
 endureth three hours; but there were but few knights
 that time living that knew this advantage that Sir Gawaine
 had, but King Arthur all only.
 
 Thus Sir Launcelot fought with Sir Gawaine, and
 when Sir Launcelot felt his might evermore increase, Sir
 Launcelot wondered and dread him sore to be shamed.
 For as the French book saith, Sir Launcelot weened, when
 he felt Sir Gawaine double his strength, that he had been
 a fiend and none earthly man; wherefore Sir Launcelot
 traced and traversed, and covered himself with his shield,
 and kept his might and his braide during three hours;
 and that while Sir Gawaine gave him many sad brunts,
 and many sad strokes, that all the knights that beheld
 Sir Launcelot marvelled how that he might endure him;
 but full little understood they that travail that Sir
 Launcelot had for to endure him.  And then when it was
 past noon Sir Gawaine had no more but his own might.
 When Sir Launcelot felt him so come down, then he
 stretched him up and stood near Sir Gawaine, and said
 thus:  My lord Sir Gawaine, now I feel ye have done;
 now my lord Sir Gawaine, I must do my part, for many
 great and grievous strokes I have endured you this day
 with great pain.
 
 Then Sir Launcelot doubled his strokes and gave Sir
 Gawaine such a buffet on the helmet that he fell down
 on his side, and Sir Launcelot withdrew him from him.
 Why withdrawest thou thee? said Sir Gawaine; now turn
 again, false traitor knight, and slay me, for an thou leave
 me thus, when I am whole I shall do battle with thee
 again.  I shall endure you, Sir, by God's grace, but wit
 thou well, Sir Gawaine, I will never smite a felled knight.
 And so Sir Launcelot went into the city; and Sir Gawaine
 was borne into King Arthur's pavilion, and leeches were
 brought to him, and searched and salved with soft ointments.
 And then Sir Launcelot said: Now have good
 day, my lord the king, for wit you well ye win no worship
 at these walls; and if I would my knights outbring, there
 should many a man die.  Therefore, my lord Arthur,
 remember you of old kindness; and however I fare, Jesu
 be your guide in all places.
