 CHAPTER XI
 
 How Sir Beaumains suffered great rebukes of the damosel,
 and he suffered it patiently.
 
 DAMOSEL, said Beaumains, ye are uncourteous so to rebuke me as ye
 do, for meseemeth I have done you good service, and ever ye
 threaten me I shall be beaten with knights that we meet, but ever
 for all your boast they lie in the dust or in the mire, and
 therefore I pray you rebuke me no more; and when ye see me beaten
 or yielden as recreant, then may ye bid me go from you
 shamefully; but first I let you wit I will not depart from you,
 for I were worse than a fool an I would depart from you all the
 while that I win worship.  Well, said she, right soon there shall
 meet a knight shall pay thee all thy wages, for he is the most
 man of worship of the world, except King Arthur.  I will well,
 said Beaumains, the more he is of worship, the more shall be my
 worship to have ado with him.
 
 Then anon they were ware where was afore them a city rich and
 fair.  And betwixt them and the city a mile and an half there was
 a fair meadow that seemed new mown, and therein were many
 pavilions fair to behold.  &lt;227&gt;Lo, said the damosel, yonder is a
 lord that owneth yonder city, and his custom is, when the weather
 is fair, to lie in this meadow to joust and tourney.  And ever
 there be about him five hundred knights and gentlemen of arms,
 and there be all manner of games that any gentleman can devise. 
 That goodly lord, said Beaumains, would I fain see.  Thou shalt
 see him time enough, said the damosel, and so as she rode near
 she espied the pavilion where he was.  Lo, said she, seest thou
 yonder pavilion that is all of the colour of Inde, and all manner
 of thing that there is about, men and women, and horses trapped,
 shields and spears were all of the colour of Inde, and his name
 is Sir Persant of Inde, the most lordliest knight that ever thou
 lookedst on.  It may well be, said Beaumains, but be he never so
 stout a knight, in this field I shall abide till that I see him
 under his shield.  Ah, fool, said she, thou wert better flee
 betimes.  Why, said Beaumains, an he be such a knight as ye make
 him, he will not set upon me with all his men, or with his five
 hundred knights.  For an there come no more but one at once, I
 shall him not fail whilst my life lasteth.  Fie, fie, said the
 damosel, that ever such a stinking knave should blow such a
 boast.  Damosel, he said, ye are to blame so to rebuke me, for I
 had liefer do five battles than so to be rebuked, let him come
 and then let him do his worst.
 
 Sir, she said, I marvel what thou art and of what kin thou art
 come; boldly thou speakest, and boldly thou hast done, that have
 I seen; therefore I pray thee save thyself an thou mayest, for
 thy horse and thou have had great travail, and I dread we dwell
 over long from the siege, for it is but hence seven mile, and all
 perilous passages we are passed save all only this passage; and
 here I dread me sore lest ye shall catch some hurt, therefore I
 would ye were hence, that ye were not bruised nor hurt with this
 strong knight.  But I let you wit that Sir Persant of Inde is
 nothing of might nor strength unto the knight that laid the siege
 about my lady.  As for that, said Sir Beaumains, be it as it be
 may.  For sithen I am come so nigh this knight I will prove his
 might or I depart &lt;228&gt;from him, and else I shall be shamed an I
 now withdraw me from him.  And therefore, damosel, have ye no
 doubt by the grace of God I shall so deal with this knight that
 within two hours after noon I shall deliver him.  And then shall
 we come to the siege by daylight.  O Jesu, marvel have I, said
 the damosel, what manner a man ye be, for it may never be
 otherwise but that ye be come of a noble blood, for so foul nor
 shamefully did never woman rule a knight as I have done you, and
 ever courteously ye have suffered me, and that came never but of
 a gentle blood.
 
 Damosel, said Beaumains, a knight may little do that may not
 suffer a damosel, for whatsomever ye said unto me I took none
 heed to your words, for the more ye said the more ye angered me,
 and my wrath I wreaked upon them that I had ado withal.  And
 therefore all the missaying that ye missaid me furthered me in my
 battle, and caused me to think to show and prove myself at the
 end what I was; for peradventure though I had meat in King
 Arthur's kitchen, yet I might have had meat enough in other
 places, but all that I did it for to prove and assay my friends,
 and that shall be known another day; and whether that I be a
 gentleman born or none, I let you wit, fair damosel, I have done
 you gentleman's service, and peradventure better service yet will
 I do or I depart from you.  Alas, she said, fair Beaumains,
 forgive me all that I have missaid or done against thee.  With
 all my heart, said he, I forgive it you, for ye did nothing but
 as ye should do, for all your evil words pleased me; and damosel,
 said Beaumains, since it liketh you to say thus fair unto me, wit
 ye well it gladdeth my heart greatly, and now meseemeth there is
 no knight living but I am able enough for him.
