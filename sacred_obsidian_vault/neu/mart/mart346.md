 CHAPTER VII
 
 Of a great tourneying in the Joyous Isle, and how Sir
 Pervivale and Sir Ector came thither, and Sir Percivale
 fought with him.
 
 
 SO when this cry was made, unto Joyous Isle drew
 knights to the number of five hundred; and wit ye
 well there was never seen in Arthur's days one knight
 that did so much deeds of arms as Sir Launcelot did
 three days together; for as the book maketh truly
 mention, he had the better of all the five hundred
 knights, and there was not one slain of them.  And
 after that Sir Launcelot made them all a great feast.
 
 And in the meanwhile came Sir Percivale de Galis
 and Sir Ector de Maris under that castle that was
 called the Joyous Isle.  And as they beheld that gay
 castle they would have gone to that castle, but they
 might not for the broad water, and bridge could they
 find none.  Then they saw on the other side a lady
 with a sperhawk on her hand, and Sir Percivale called
 unto her, and asked that lady who was in that castle.
 Fair knights, she said, here within this castle is the
 fairest lady in this land, and her name is Elaine.  Also
 we have in this castle the fairest knight and the mightiest
 man that is I dare say living, and he called himself Le
 Chevaler Mal Fet.  How came he into these marches?
 said Sir Percivale.  Truly, said the damosel, he came
 into this country like a mad man, with dogs and boys
 chasing him through the city of Corbin, and by the
 holy vessel of the Sangreal he was brought into his
 wit again; but he will not do battle with no knight,
 but by underne or by noon.  And if ye list to come
 into the castle, said the lady, ye must ride unto the
 further side of the castle and there shall ye find a vessel
 that will bear you and your horse.  Then they departed,
 and came unto the vessel.  And then Sir Percivale
 alighted, and said to Sir Ector de Maris:  Ye shall
 abide me here until that I wit what manner a knight
 he is; for it were shame unto us, inasmuch as he is
 but one knight, an we should both do battle with
 him.  Do ye as ye list, said Sir Ector, and here I
 shall abide you until that I hear of you
 
 Then passed Sir Percivale the water, and when he
 came to the castle gate he bade the porter:  Go thou
 to the good knight within the castle, and tell him here
 is come an errant knight to joust with him.  Sir, said
 the porter, ride ye within the castle, and there is a
 common place for jousting, that lords and ladies may
 behold you.  So anon as Sir Launcelot had warning he
 was soon ready; and there Sir Percivale and Sir
 Launcelot encountered with such a might, and their
 spears were so rude, that both the horses and the knights
 fell to the earth.  Then they avoided their horses,
 and flang out noble swords, and hewed away cantels
 of their shields, and hurtled together with their shields
 like two boars, and either wounded other passing sore.
 At the last Sir Percivale spake first when they had
 foughten there more than two hours.  Fair knight, said
 Sir Percivale, I require thee tell me thy name, for I
 met never with such a knight.  Sir, said Sir Launcelot,
 my name is Le Chevaler Mal Fet.  Now tell me your
 name, said Sir Launcelot, I require you, gentle knight.
 Truly, said Sir Percivale, my name is Sir Percivale de Galis,
 that was brother unto the good knight, Sir Lamorak
 de Galis, and King Pellinore was our father, and Sir
 Aglovale is my brother.  Alas, said Sir Launcelot,
 what have I done to fight with you that art a knight
 of the Round Table, that sometime was your fellow?
