 CHAPTER XI
 
 How King Mark mocked Sir Dinadan, and how they met
 with six knights of the Round Table.
 
 
 So as they rode by the way King Mark then began to
 mock Sir Dinadan, and said:  I weened you knights of
 the Table Round might not in no wise find their matches.
 Ye say well, said Sir Dinadan; as for you, on my life I
 call you none of the best knights; but sith ye have such
 a despite at me I require you to joust with me to prove
 my strength.  Not so, said King Mark, for I will not
 have ado with you in no manner; but I require you of
 one thing, that when ye come to Arthur's court discover
 not my name, for I am there so hated.  It is shame to
 you, said Sir Dinadan, that ye govern you so shamefully;
 for I see by you ye are full of cowardice, and ye are a
 murderer, and that is the greatest shame that a knight
 may have; for never a knight being a murderer hath
 worship, nor never shall have; for I saw but late through
 my force ye would have slain Sir Berluse, a better knight
 than ye, or ever ye shall be, and more of prowess.  Thus
 they rode forth talking till they came to a fair place,
 where stood a knight, and prayed them to take their
 lodging with him.  So at the request of that knight they
 reposed them there, and made them well at ease, and had
 great cheer.  For all errant-knights were welcome to him,
 and specially all those of Arthur's court.  Then Sir
 Dinadan demanded his host what was the knight's name
 that kept the bridge.  For what cause ask you it? said
 the host.  For it is not long ago, said Sir Dinadan, sithen
 he gave me a fall.  Ah, fair knight, said his host, thereof
 have ye no marvel, for he is a passing good knight, and
 his name is Sir Tor, the son of Aries le Vaysher.  Ah,
 said Sir Dinadan, was that Sir Tor? for truly so ever me
 thought.
 
 Right as they stood thus talking together they saw
 come riding to them over a plain six knights of the court
 of King Arthur, well armed at all points.  And there by
 their shields Sir Dinadan knew them well.  The first was
 the good knight Sir Uwaine, the son of King Uriens, the
 second was the noble knight Sir Brandiles, the third was
 Ozana le Cure Hardy, the fourth was Uwaine les Aventurous,
 the fifth was Sir Agravaine, the sixth Sir Mordred,
 brother to Sir Gawaine.  When Sir Dinadan had seen
 these six knights he thought in himself he would bring
 King Mark by some wile to joust with one of them.  And
 anon they took their horses and ran after these knights
 well a three mile English.  Then was King Mark ware
 where they sat all six about a well, and ate and drank such
 meats as they had, and their horses walking and some tied,
 and their shields hung in divers places about them.  Lo,
 said Sir Dinadan, yonder are knights-errant that will joust
 with us.  God forbid, said King Mark, for they be six
 and we but two.  As for that, said Sir Dinadan, let us
 not spare, for I will assay the foremost; and therewith he
 made him ready.  When King Mark saw him do so, as
 fast as Sir Dinadan rode toward them, King Mark rode
 froward them with all his menial meiny.  So when Sir
 Dinadan saw King Mark was gone, he set the spear out of
 the rest, and threw his shield upon his back, and came,
 riding to the fellowship of the Table Round.  And anon
 Sir Uwaine knew Sir Dinadan, and welcomed him, and so
 did all his fellowship.
