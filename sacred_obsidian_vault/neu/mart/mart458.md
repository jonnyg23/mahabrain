 CHAPTER IV
 
 How Sir Launcelot's horse was slain, and how Sir Launcelot
 rode in a cart for to rescue the queen
 
 
 THEN Sir Launcelot rode as fast as he might, and the
 book saith he took the water at Westminster Bridge, and
 made his horse to swim over Thames unto Lambeth.
 And then within a while he came to the same place thereas
 the ten noble knights fought with Sir Meliagrance.  And
 then Sir Launcelot followed the track until that he came
 to a wood, and there was a straight way, and there the
 thirty archers bade Sir Launcelot turn again, and follow
 no longer that track.  What commandment have ye
 thereto, said Sir Launcelot, to cause me that am a knight
 of the Round Table to leave my right way?  This way
 shalt thou leave, other-else thou shalt go it on thy foot,
 for wit thou well thy horse shall be slain.  That is little
 mastery, said Sir Launcelot, to slay mine horse; but as
 for myself, when my horse is slain, I give right nought
 for you, not an ye were five hundred more.  So then they
 shot Sir Launcelot's horse, and smote him with many
 arrows; and then Sir Launcelot avoided his horse, and
 went on foot; but there were so many ditches and hedges
 betwixt them and him that he might not meddle with
 none of them.  Alas for shame, said Launcelot, that ever
 one knight should betray another knight; but it is an old
 saw, A good man is never in danger but when he is in the
 danger of a coward.  Then Sir Launcelot went a while,
 and then he was foul cumbered of his armour, his shield,
 and his spear, and all that longed unto him.  Wit ye well
 he was full sore annoyed, and full loath he was for to leave
 anything that longed unto him, for he dread sore the
 treason of Sir Meliagrance.
 
 Then by fortune there came by him a chariot that
 came thither for to fetch wood.  Say me, carter, said Sir
 Launcelot, what shall I give thee to suffer me to leap
 into thy chariot, and that thou bring me unto a castle
 within this two mile? Thou shalt not come within my
 chariot, said the carter, for I am sent for to fetch wood
 for my lord, Sir Meliagrance.  With him would I speak.
 Thou shalt not go with me, said the carter.  Then Sir
 Launcelot leapt to him, and gave him such a buffet that
 he fell to the earth stark dead.  Then the other carter,
 his fellow, was afeard, and weened to have gone the same
 way; and then he cried:  Fair lord, save my life, and I
 shall bring you where ye will.  Then I charge thee, said
 Sir Launcelot, that thou drive me and this chariot even
 unto Sir Meliagrance's gate.  Leap up into the chariot, said
 the carter, and ye shall be there anon.  So the carter drove on
 a great wallop, and Sir Launcelot's horse followed the chariot,
 with more than a forty arrows broad and rough in him.
 
 And more than an hour and an half Dame Guenever
 was awaiting in a bay window with her ladies, and espied
 an armed knight standing in a chariot.  See, madam, said
 a lady, where rideth in a chariot a goodly armed knight;
 I suppose he rideth unto hanging.  Where? said the
 queen.  Then she espied by his shield that he was there
 himself, Sir Launcelot du Lake.  And then she was ware
 where came his horse ever after that chariot, and ever he
 trod his guts and his paunch under his feet.  Alas, said
 the queen, now I see well and prove, that well is him that
 hath a trusty friend.  Ha, ha, most noble knight, said
 Queen Guenever, I see well thou art hard bestead when thou
 ridest in a chariot.  Then she rebuked that lady that likened
 Sir Launcelot to ride in a chariot to hanging.  It was foul
 mouthed, said the queen, and evil likened, so for to liken the
 most noble knight of the world unto such a shameful death.
 O Jesu defend him and keep him, said the queen, from
 all mischievous end.  By this was Sir Launcelot come to
 the gates of that castle, and there he descended down, and
 cried, that all the castle rang of it:  Where art thou, false
 traitor, Sir Meliagrance, and knight of the Table Round?
 now come forth here, thou traitor knight, thou and thy
 fellowship with thee; for here I am, Sir Launcelot du
 Lake, that shall fight with you.  And therewithal he bare
 the gate wide open upon the porter, and smote him under
 his ear with his gauntlet, that his neck brast a-sunder.
