 CHAPTER LVIII
 
 How they approached the Castle Lonazep, and of other
 devices of the death of Sir Lamorak.
 
 
 THUS they rode until they were ware of the Castle
 Lonazep.  And then were they ware of four hundred
 tents and pavilions, and marvellous great ordinance.  So
 God me help, said Sir Tristram, yonder I see the greatest
 ordinance that ever I saw.  Sir, said Palomides, meseemeth
 that there was as great an ordinance at the Castle of
 Maidens upon the rock, where ye won the prize, for I
 saw myself where ye forjousted thirty knights.  Sir, said
 Dinadan, and in Surluse, at that tournament that Galahalt
 of the Long Isles made, the which there dured seven days,
 was as great a gathering as is here, for there were many
 nations.  Who was the best? said Sir Tristram.  Sir, it
 was Sir Launcelot du Lake and the noble knight, Sir
 Lamorak de Galis, and Sir Launcelot won the degree.  I
 doubt not, said Sir Tristram, but he won the degree, so
 he had not been overmatched with many knights; and of
 the death of Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, it was over
 great pity, for I dare say he was the cleanest mighted man
 and the best winded of his age that was alive; for I knew
 him that he was the biggest knight that ever I met withal,
 but if it were Sir Launcelot.  Alas, said Sir Tristram, full
 woe is me for his death.  And if they were not the cousins
 of my lord Arthur that slew him, they should die for it,
 and all those that were consenting to his death.  And for
 such things, said Sir Tristram, I fear to draw unto the
 court of my lord Arthur; I will that ye wit it, said Sir
 Tristram unto Gareth.
 
 Sir, I blame you not, said Gareth, for well I understand
 the vengeance of my brethren Sir Gawaine, Agravaine,
 Gaheris, and Mordred.  But as for me, said Sir
 Gareth, I meddle not of their matters, therefore there is
 none of them that loveth me.  And for I understand they
 be murderers of good knights I left their company; and
 God would I had been by, said Gareth, when the noble
 knight, Sir Lamorak, was slain.  Now as Jesu be my help,
 said Sir Tristram, it is well said of you, for I had liefer
 than all the gold betwixt this and Rome I had been there.
 Y-wis,[1] said Palomides, and so would I had been there,
 and yet had I never the degree at no jousts nor tournament
 thereas he was, but he put me to the worse, or on
 foot or on horseback; and that day that he was slain he
 did the most deeds of arms that ever I saw knight do in
 all my life days.  And when him was given the degree by
 my lord Arthur, Sir Gawaine and his three brethren, Agravaine,
 Gaheris, and Sir Mordred, set upon Sir Lamorak in
 a privy place, and there they slew his horse.  And so they
 fought with him on foot more than three hours, both
 before him and behind him; and Sir Mordred gave him
 his death wound behind him at his back, and all to-hew
 him: for one of his squires told me that saw it.  Fie
 upon treason, said Sir Tristram, for it killeth my heart to
 hear this tale.  So it doth mine, said Gareth; brethren as
 they be mine I shall never love them, nor draw in their
 fellowship for that deed.
 
 Now speak we of other deeds, said Palomides, and let
 him be, for his life ye may not get again.  That is the
 more pity, said Dinadan, for Sir Gawaine and his brethren,
 except you Sir Gareth, hate all the good knights of the
 Round Table for the most part; for well I wot an they
 might privily, they hate my lord Sir Launcelot and all his
 kin, and great privy despite they have at him; and that
 is my lord Sir Launcelot well ware of, and that causeth
 him to have the good knights of his kin about him.
