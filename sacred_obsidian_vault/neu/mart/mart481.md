 CHAPTER XIV
 
 How the Pope sent down his bulls to make peace, and how
 Sir Launcelot brought the queen to King Arthur
 
 
 SO when this Bishop was come to Carlisle he shewed the
 king these bulls.  And when the king understood these
 bulls he nist what to do: full fain he would have been
 accorded with Sir Launcelot, but Sir Gawaine would not
 suffer him; but as for to have the queen, thereto he agreed.
 But in nowise Sir Gawaine would not suffer the king to
 accord with Sir Launcelot; but as for the queen he
 consented.  And then the Bishop had of the king his great
 seal, and his assurance as he was a true anointed king that
 Sir Launcelot should come safe, and go safe, and that the
 queen should not be spoken unto of the king, nor of none
 other, for no thing done afore time past; and of all these
 appointments the Bishop brought with him sure assurance
 and writing, to shew Sir Launcelot.
 
 So when the Bishop was come to Joyous Gard, there
 he shewed Sir Launcelot how the Pope had written to
 Arthur and unto him, and there he told him the perils
 if he withheld the queen from the king.  It was never in
 my thought, said Launcelot, to withhold the queen from
 my lord Arthur; but, insomuch she should have been
 dead for my sake, meseemeth it was my part to save her
 life, and put her from that danger, till better recover
 might come.  And now I thank God, said Sir Launcelot,
 that the Pope hath made her peace; for God knoweth,
 said Sir Launcelot, I will be a thousandfold more gladder
 to bring her again, than ever I was of her taking away;
 with this, I may be sure to come safe and go safe, and
 that the queen shall have her liberty as she had before;
 and never for no thing that hath been surmised afore this
 time, she never from this day stand in no peril.  For
 else, said Sir Launcelot, I dare adventure me to keep her
 from an harder shour than ever I kept her.  It shall not
 need you, said the Bishop, to dread so much; for wit you
 well, the Pope must be obeyed, and it were not the Pope's
 worship nor my poor honesty to wit you distressed,
 neither the queen, neither in peril, nor shamed.  And
 then he shewed Sir Launcelot all his writing, both from
 the Pope and from King Arthur.  This is sure enough,
 said Sir Launcelot, for full well I dare trust my lord's
 own writing and his seal, for he was never shamed of his
 promise.  Therefore, said Sir Launcelot unto the Bishop,
 ye shall ride unto the king afore, and recommend me
 unto his good grace, and let him have knowledging that
 this same day eight days, by the grace of God, I myself
 shall bring my lady, Queen Guenever, unto him.  And
 then say ye unto my most redoubted king, that I will say
 largely for the queen, that I shall none except for dread
 nor fear, but the king himself, and my lord Sir Gawaine;
 and that is more for the king's love than for himself.
 
 So the Bishop departed and came to the king at
 Carlisle, and told him all how Sir Launcelot answered
 him; and then the tears brast out of the king's eyen.
 Then Sir Launcelot purveyed him an hundred knights,
 and all were clothed in green velvet, and their horses
 trapped to their heels; and every knight held a branch of
 olive in his hand, in tokening of peace.  And the queen
 had four-and-twenty gentlewomen following her in the
 same wise; and Sir Launcelot had twelve coursers
 following him, and on every courser sat a young gentleman,
 and all they were arrayed in green velvet, with sarps
 of gold about their quarters, and the horse trapped in the
 same wise down to the heels, with many ouches, y-set with
 stones and pearls in gold, to the number of a thousand.
 And she and Sir Launcelot were clothed in white cloth of
 gold tissue; and right so as ye have heard, as the French
 book maketh mention, he rode with the queen from
 Joyous Gard to Carlisle.  And so Sir Launcelot rode
 throughout Carlisle, and so in the castle, that all men
 might behold; and wit you well there was many a
 weeping eye.  And then Sir Launcelot himself alighted
 and avoided his horse, and took the queen, and so led her
 where King Arthur was in his seat: and Sir Gawaine sat
 afore him, and many other great lords.  So when Sir
 Launcelot saw the king and Sir Gawaine, then he led the
 queen by the arm, and then he kneeled down, and the
 queen both.  Wit you well then was there many bold
 knight there with King Arthur that wept as tenderly as
 though they had seen all their kin afore them.  So the
 king sat still, and said no word.  And when Sir Launcelot
 saw his countenance, he arose and pulled up the queen
 with him, and thus he spake full knightly.
