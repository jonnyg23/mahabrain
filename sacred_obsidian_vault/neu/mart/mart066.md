 CHAPTER VI
 
 How King Arthur, King Uriens, and Sir Accolon of Gaul,
 chased an hart, and of their marvellous adventures.
 
 THEN it befell that Arthur and many of his knights rode a-hunting
 into a great forest, and it happed King Arthur, King Uriens, and
 Sir Accolon of Gaul, followed a great hart, for they three were
 well horsed, and so they chased so fast that within a while they
 three were then ten mile from their fellowship.  And at the last
 they chased so sore that they slew their horses underneath them. 
 Then were they all three on foot, and ever they saw the hart
 afore them passing weary and enbushed.  What will we do? said
 King Arthur, we are hard bestead.  Let us go on foot, said King
 Uriens, till we may meet with some lodging.  Then were they ware
 of the hart that lay on a great water bank, and a brachet biting
 on his throat, and more other hounds came after.  Then King
 Arthur blew the prise and dight the hart.
 
 Then the king looked about the world, and saw afore him in a
 great water a little ship, all apparelled with silk down to the
 water, and the ship came right unto them and landed on the sands. 
 Then Arthur went to the bank and looked in, and saw none earthly
 creature therein.  Sirs, said the king, come thence, and let us
 see what is in this ship.  So they went in all three, and found
 it richly behanged with cloth of silk.  By then it was dark
 night, and there suddenly were about them an hundred torches set
 upon all the sides of the ship boards, and it gave great light;
 and therewithal there came out twelve fair damosels and saluted
 King Arthur on their knees, and called him by his name, and said
 he was right welcome, and such cheer as they had he should have
 of the best.  The king thanked them fair.  Therewithal they led
 the king and his two fellows into a fair chamber, and there was a
 cloth laid, richly beseen of all that longed unto a table, and
 there &lt;111&gt;were they served of all wines and meats that they
 could think; of that the king had great marvel, for he fared
 never better in his life as for one supper.  And so when they had
 supped at their leisure, King Arthur was led into a chamber, a
 richer beseen chamber saw he never none, and so was King Uriens
 served, and led into such another chamber, and Sir Accolon was
 led into the third chamber passing richly and well beseen; and so
 they were laid in their beds easily.  And anon they fell asleep,
 and slept marvellously sore all the night.  And on the morrow
 King Uriens was in Camelot abed in his wife's arms, Morgan le
 Fay.  And when he awoke he had great marvel, how he came there,
 for on the even afore he was two days' journey from Camelot.  And
 when King Arthur awoke he found himself in a dark prison, hearing
 about him many complaints of woful knights.
