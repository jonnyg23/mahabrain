 CHAPTER VII
 
 How Sir Bors was lodged with a lady, and how he took upon
 him for to fight against a champion for her land.
 
 
 AND when he was unarmed they led him into an high
 tower where was a lady, young, lusty, and fair.  And she
 received him with great joy, and made him to sit down by
 her, and so was he set to sup with flesh and many dainties.
 And when Sir Bors saw that, he bethought him on his
 penance, and bade a squire to bring him water.  And so
 he brought him, and he made sops therein and ate them.
 Ah, said the lady, I trow ye like not my meat.  Yes,
 truly, said Sir Bors, God thank you, madam, but I may
 eat none other meat this day.  Then she spake no more
 as at that time, for she was loath to displease him.  Then
 after supper they spake of one thing and other.
 
 With that came a squire and said: Madam, ye must
 purvey you to-morn for a champion, for else your sister
 will have this castle and also your lands, except ye can
 find a knight that will fight to-morn in your quarrel
 against Pridam le Noire.  Then she made sorrow and
 said:  Ah, Lord God, wherefore granted ye to hold my
 land, whereof I should now be disherited without reason
 and right?  And when Sir Bors had heard her say thus,
 he said:  I shall comfort you.  Sir, said she, I shall tell
 you there was here a king that hight Aniause, which held
 all this land in his keeping.  So it mishapped he loved a
 gentlewoman a great deal elder than I.  So took he her
 all this land to her keeping, and all his men to govern;
 and she brought up many evil customs whereby she put to
 death a great part of his kinsmen.  And when he saw that,
 he let chase her out of this land, and betook it me, and all
 this land in my demesnes.  But anon as that worthy king
 was dead, this other lady began to war upon me, and hath
 destroyed many of my men, and turned them against me,
 that I have well-nigh no man left me; and I have nought
 else but this high tower that she left me.  And yet she
 hath promised me to have this tower, without I can find a
 knight to fight with her champion.
 
 Now tell me, said Sir Bors, what is that Pridam le
 Noire?  Sir, said she, he is the most doubted man of this
 land.  Now may ye send her word that ye have found a
 knight that shall fight with that Pridam le Noire in God's
 quarrel and yours.  Then that lady was not a little glad,
 and sent word that she was purveyed, and that night Bors
 had good cheer; but in no bed he would come, but laid
 him on the floor, nor never would do otherwise till that
 he had met with the quest of the Sangreal.
