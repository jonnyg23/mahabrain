 CHAPTER XLIII
 
 How Sir Archade appealed Sir Palomides of treason, and
 how Sir Palomides slew him.
 
 
 WHEN Palomides was unarmed he asked lodging for
 himself and the damosel.  Anon the haut prince commanded
 them to lodging.  And he was not so soon in his
 lodging but there came a knight that hight Archade, he
 was brother unto Goneries that Palomides slew afore in
 the damosel's quarrel.  And this knight, Archade, called
 Sir Palomides traitor, and appealed him for the death of
 his brother.  By the leave of the haut prince, said Palomides,
 I shall answer thee.  When Sir Galahalt understood
 their quarrel he bade them go to dinner:  And as
 soon as ye have dined look that either knight be ready in
 the field.  So when they had dined they were armed both,
 and took their horses, and the queen, and the prince, and
 Sir Launcelot, were set to behold them; and so they let
 run their horses, and there Sir Palomides bare Archade
 on his spear over his horse's tail.  And then Palomides
 alighted and drew his sword, but Sir Archade might not
 arise; and there Sir Palomides raced off his helm, and
 smote off his head.  Then the haut prince and Queen
 Guenever went unto supper.  Then King Bagdemagus
 sent away his son Meliagaunce because Sir Launcelot
 should not meet with him, for he hated Sir Launcelot,
 and that knew he not.
