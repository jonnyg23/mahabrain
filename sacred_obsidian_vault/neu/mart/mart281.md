 CHAPTER XLIV
 
 Of the third day, and how Sir Palomides jousted with Sir
 Lamorak, and other things.
 
 
 NOW beginneth the third day of jousting; and at that
 day King Bagdemagus made him ready; and there came
 against him King Marsil, that had in gift an island of Sir
 Galahalt the haut prince; and this island had the name
 Pomitain.  Then it befell that King Bagdemagus and
 King Marsil of Pomitain met together with spears, and
 King Marsil had such a buffet that he fell over his horse's
 croup.  Then came there in a knight of King Marsil to
 revenge his lord, and King Bagdemagus smote him down,
 horse and man, to the earth.  So there came an earl that
 hight Arrouse, and Sir Breuse, and an hundred knights
 with them of Pomitain, and the King of Northgalis was
 with them; and all these were against them of Surluse.
 And then there began great battle, and many knights
 were cast under horses' feet.  And ever King Bagdemagus
 did best, for he first began, and ever he held on.  Gaheris,
 Gawaine's brother, smote ever at the face of King Bagdemagus;
 and at the last King Bagdemagus hurtled down
 Gaheris, horse and man.
 
 Then by adventure Sir Palomides, the good knight,
 met with Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis' brother.
 And either smote other with great spears, that both their
 horses and knights fell to the earth.  But Sir Blamore
 had such a fall that he had almost broken his neck, for
 the blood brast out at nose, mouth, and his ears, but at
 the last he recovered well by good surgeons.  Then there
 came in the Duke Chaleins of Clarance; and in his
 governance there came a knight that hight Elis la Noire;
 and there encountered with him King Bagdemagus, and
 he smote Elis that he made him to avoid his saddle.  So
 the Duke Chaleins of Clarance did there great deeds of
 arms, and of so late as he came in the third day there was
 no man did so well except King Bagdemagus and Sir
 Palomides, that the prize was given that day to King
 Bagdemagus.  And then they blew unto lodging, and
 unarmed them, and went to the feast.  Right so came
 Dinadan, and mocked and japed with King Bagdemagus
 that all knights laughed at him, for he was a fine japer,
 and well loving all good knights.
 
 So anon as they had dined there came a varlet bearing
 four spears on his back; and he came to Palomides, and
 said thus:  Here is a knight by hath sent you the choice
 of four spears, and requireth you for your lady's sake to
 take that one half of these spears, and joust with him in
 the field.  Tell him, said Palomides, I will not fail him.
 When Sir Galahalt wist of this, he bade Palomides make
 him ready.  So the Queen Guenever, the haut prince, and
 Sir Launcelot, they were set upon scaffolds to give the
 judgment of these two knights.  Then Sir Palomides and
 the strange knight ran so eagerly together that their
 spears brake to their hands.  Anon withal either of
 them took a great spear in his hand and all to-shivered
 them in pieces.  And then either took a greater spear,
 and then the knight smote down Sir Palomides, horse and
 man, to the earth.  And as he would have passed over
 him the strange knight's horse stumbled and fell down
 upon Palomides.  Then they drew their swords and lashed
 together wonderly sore a great while.
 
 Then the haut prince and Sir Launcelot said they saw
 never two knights fight better than they did; but ever
 the strange knight doubled his strokes, and put Palomides
 aback; therewithal the haut prince cried:  Ho: and then
 they went to lodging.  And when they were unarmed
 they knew it was the noble knight Sir Lamorak.  When
 Sir Launcelot knew that it was Sir Lamorak he made
 much of him, for above all earthly men he loved him best
 except Sir Tristram.  Then Queen Guenever commended
 him, and so did all other good knights make much of him,
 except Sir Gawaine's brethren.  Then Queen Guenever
 said unto Sir Launcelot:  Sir, I require you that an ye
 joust any more, that ye joust with none of the blood
 of my lord Arthur.  So he promised he would not as at
 that time.
