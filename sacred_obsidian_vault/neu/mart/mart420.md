 CHAPTER XIV
 
 How a knight brought unto Sir Galahad a horse, and bade
 him come from his father, Sir Launcelot.
 
 
 SO after, on a Monday, it befell that they arrived in the
 edge of a forest to-fore a cross; and then saw they a
 knight armed all in white, and was richly horsed, and led
 in his right hand a white horse; and so he came to the
 ship, and saluted the two knights on the High Lord's
 behalf, and said:  Galahad, sir, ye have been long enough
 with your father, come out of the ship, and start upon
 this horse, and go where the adventures shall lead thee in
 the quest of the Sangreal.  Then he went to his father
 and kissed him sweetly, and said:  Fair sweet father, I wot
 not when I shall see you more till I see the body of Jesu
 Christ.  I pray you, said Launcelot, pray ye to the High
 Father that He hold me in His service.  And so he took
 his horse, and there they heard a voice that said:  Think
 for to do well, for the one shall never see the other before
 the dreadful day of doom.  Now, son Galahad, said
 Launcelot, since we shall depart, and never see other, I
 pray to the High Father to conserve me and you both.
 Sir, said Galahad, no prayer availeth so much as yours
 And therewith Galahad entered into the forest.
 
 And the wind arose, and drove Launcelot more than a
 month throughout the sea, where he slept but little, but
 prayed to God that he might see some tidings of the
 Sangreal.  So it befell on a night, at midnight, he arrived
 afore a castle, on the back side, which was rich and fair,
 and there was a postern opened toward the sea, and was
 open without any keeping, save two lions kept the entry;
 and the moon shone clear.  Anon Sir Launcelot heard a
 voice that said:  Launcelot, go out of this ship and enter
 into the castle, where thou shalt see a great part of thy
 desire.  Then he ran to his arms, and so armed him, and
 so went to the gate and saw the lions.  Then set he hand
 to his sword and drew it.  Then there came a dwarf
 suddenly, and smote him on the arm so sore that the
 sword fell out of his hand.  Then heard he a voice say:
 O man of evil faith and poor belief, wherefore trowest
 thou more on thy harness than in thy Maker, for He
 might more avail thee than thine armour, in whose
 service that thou art set.  Then said Launcelot:  Fair
 Father Jesu Christ, I thank thee of Thy great mercy that
 Thou reprovest me of my misdeed; now see I well that
 ye hold me for your servant.  Then took he again his
 sword and put it up in his sheath, and made a cross in his
 forehead, and came to the lions, and they made semblaunt
 to do him harm.  Notwithstanding he passed by them
 without hurt, and entered into the castle to the chief
 fortress, and there were they all at rest.  Then Launcelot
 entered in so armed, for he found no gate nor door but it
 was open.  And at the last he found a chamber whereof
 the door was shut, and he set his hand thereto to have
 opened it, but he might not.
