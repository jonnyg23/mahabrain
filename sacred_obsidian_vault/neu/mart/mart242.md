 CHAPTER V
 
 How Sir Tristram met at the peron with Sir Launcelot,
 and how they fought together unknown.
 
 
 THEN departed Sir Tristram and rode straight unto
 Camelot, to the peron that Merlin had made to-fore,
 where Sir Lanceor, that was the king's son of Ireland, was
 slain by the hands of Balin.  And in that same place was
 the fair lady Colombe slain, that was love unto Sir
 Lanceor; for after he was dead she took his sword and
 thrust it through her body.  And by the craft of Merlin
 he made to inter this knight, Lanceor, and his lady,
 Colombe, under one stone.  And at that time Merlin
 prophesied that in that same place should fight two the
 best knights that ever were in Arthur's days, and the best
 lovers.  So when Sir Tristram came to the tomb where
 Lanceor and his lady were buried he looked about him
 after Sir Palomides.  Then was he ware of a seemly knight
 came riding against him all in white, with a covered
 shield.  When he came nigh Sir Tristram he said on
 high:  Ye be welcome, sir knight, and well and truly have
 ye holden your promise.  And then they dressed their
 shields and spears, and came together with all their might
 of their horses; and they met so fiercely that both their
 horses and knights fell to the earth, and as fast as they
 might avoided their horses, and put their shields afore
 them; and they struck together with bright swords, as
 men that were of might, and either wounded other
 wonderly sore, that the blood ran out upon the grass.
 And thus they fought the space of four hours, that never
 one would speak to other one word, and of their harness
 they had hewn off many pieces.  O Lord Jesu, said
 Gouvernail, I marvel greatly of the strokes my master
 hath given to your master.  By my head, said Sir Launcelot's
 servant, your master hath not given so many but
 your master has received as many or more.  O Jesu, said
 Gouvernail, it is too much for Sir Palomides to suffer or
 Sir Launcelot, and yet pity it were that either of these
 good knights should destroy other's blood.  So they stood
 and wept both, and made great dole when they saw the
 bright swords over-covered with blood of their bodies.
 
 Then at the last spake Sir Launcelot and said:  Knight,
 thou fightest wonderly well as ever I saw knight, therefore,
 an it please you, tell me your name.  Sir, said Sir Tristram,
 that is me loath to tell any man my name.  Truly,
 said Sir Launcelot, an I were required I was never loath
 to tell my name.  It is well said, said Sir Tristram, then I
 require you to tell me your name?  Fair knight, he said,
 my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake.  Alas, said Sir Tristram,
 what have I done! for ye are the man in the world
 that I love best.  Fair knight, said Sir Launcelot, tell me
 your name?  Truly, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de
 Liones.  O Jesu, said Sir Launcelot, what adventure is
 befallen me!  And therewith Sir Launcelot kneeled down
 and yielded him up his sword.  And therewith Sir Tristram
 kneeled adown, and yielded him up his sword.  And
 so either gave other the degree.  And then they both
 forthwithal went to the stone, and set them down upon it,
 and took off their helms to cool them, and either kissed
 other an hundred times.  And then anon after they took
 off their helms and rode to Camelot.  And there they met
 with Sir Gawaine and with Sir Gaheris that had made
 promise to Arthur never to come again to the court till
 they had brought Sir Tristram with them.
