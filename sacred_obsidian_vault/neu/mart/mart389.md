 CHAPTER VI
 
 How Sir Launcelot told his advision to a woman, and
 how she expounded it to him.
 
 
 AND then he told her altogether word by word, and the
 truth how it befell him at the tournament.  And after
 told her his advision that he had had that night in his
 sleep, and prayed her to tell him what it might mean, for
 he was not well content with it.  Ah, Launcelot, said she,
 as long as ye were knight of earthly knighthood ye were
 the most marvellous man of the world, and most adventurous.
 Now, said the lady, sithen ye be set among the
 knights of heavenly adventures, if adventure fell thee
 contrary at that tournament have thou no marvel, for that
 tournament yesterday was but a tokening of Our Lord.
 And not for then there was none enchantment, for they
 at the tournament were earthly knights.  The tournament
 was a token to see who should have most knights, either
 Eliazar, the son of King Pelles, or Argustus, the son of
 King Harlon.  But Eliazar was all clothed in white, and
 Argustus was covered in black, the which were [over]come.
 
 All what this betokeneth I shall tell you.  The day of
 Pentecost, when King Arthur held his court, it befell that
 earthly kings and knights took a tournament together,
 that is to say the quest of the Sangreal.  The earthly
 knights were they the which were clothed all in black,
 and the covering betokeneth the sins whereof they be not
 confessed.  And they with the covering of white betokeneth
 virginity, and they that chose chastity.  And
 thus was the quest begun in them.  Then thou beheld
 the sinners and the good men, and when thou sawest the
 sinners overcome, thou inclinest to that party for bobaunce
 and pride of the world, and all that must be left in that
 quest, for in this quest thou shalt have many fellows and
 thy betters.  For thou art so feeble of evil trust and good
 belief, this made it when thou were there where they took
 thee and led thee into the forest.  And anon there appeared
 the Sangreal unto the white knights, but thou was so feeble
 of good belief and faith that thou mightest not abide it for
 all the teaching of the good man, but anon thou turnest
 to the sinners, and that caused thy misadventure that thou
 should'st know good from evil and vain glory of the
 world, the which is not worth a pear.  And for great
 pride thou madest great sorrow that thou hadst not
 overcome all the white knights with the covering of white, by
 whom was betokened virginity and chastity; and therefore
 God was wroth with you, for God loveth no such deeds
 in this quest.  And this advision signifieth that thou were
 of evil faith and of poor belief, the which will make thee
 to fall into the deep pit of hell if thou keep thee not.
 Now have I warned thee of thy vain glory and of thy
 pride, that thou hast many times erred against thy Maker.
 Beware of everlasting pain, for of all earthly knights I
 have most pity of thee, for I know well thou hast not thy
 peer of any earthly sinful man.
 
 And so she commended Sir Launcelot to dinner.  And
 after dinner he took his horse and commended her to God,
 and so rode into a deep valley, and there he saw a river
 and an high mountain.  And through the water he must
 needs pass, the which was hideous; and then in the name
 of God he took it with good heart.  And when he came
 over he saw an armed knight, horse and man black as any
 bear; without any word he smote Sir Launcelot's horse to
 the earth; and so he passed on, he wist not where he was
 become.  And then he took his helm and his shield, and
 thanked God of his adventure.
