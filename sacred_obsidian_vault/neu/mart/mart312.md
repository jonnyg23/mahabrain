 CHAPTER LXXV
 
 How Sir Tristram departed of the field, and awaked Sir
 Dinadan, and changed his array into black.
 
 
 THEN came King Arthur, and the King of Northgalis,
 and Sir Launcelot du Lake; and Sir Bleoberis, Sir Bors
 de Ganis, Sir Ector de Maris, these three knights came
 into the field with Sir Launcelot.  And then Sir
 Launcelot with the three knights of his kin did so great
 deeds of arms that all the noise began upon Sir Launcelot.
 And so they beat the King of Wales and the King of
 Scots far aback, and made them to avoid the field; but
 Sir Tristram and Sir Gareth abode still in the field and
 endured all that ever there came, that all men had wonder
 that any knight might endure so many strokes.  But
 ever Sir Launcelot, and his three kinsmen by the commandment
 of Sir Launcelot, forbare Sir Tristram.  Then
 said Sir Arthur:  Is that Sir Palomides that endureth
 so well?  Nay, said Sir Launcelot, wit ye well it is
 the good knight Sir Tristram, for yonder ye may see
 Sir Palomides beholdeth and hoveth, and doth little
 or nought.  And sir, ye shall understand that Sir
 Tristram weeneth this day to beat us all out of the
 field.  And as for me, said Sir Launcelot, I shall not
 beat him, beat him whoso will.  Sir, said Launcelot
 unto Arthur, ye may see how Sir Palomides hoveth
 yonder, as though he were in a dream; wit ye well
 he is full heavy that Tristram doth such deeds of arms
 Then is he but a fool, said Arthur, for never was Sir
 Palomides, nor never shall be, of such prowess as Sir
 Tristram.  And if he have any envy at Sir Tristram,
 and cometh in with him upon his side he is a false
 knight.
 
 As the king and Sir Launcelot thus spake, Sir
 Tristram rode privily out of the press, that none espied
 him but La Beale Isoud and Sir Palomides, for they two
 would not let off their eyes upon Sir Tristram.  And
 when Sir Tristram came to his pavilions he found Sir
 Dinadan in his bed asleep.  Awake, said Tristram, ye
 ought to be ashamed so to sleep when knights have
 ado in the field.  Then Sir Dinadan arose lightly and
 said:  What will ye that I shall do?  Make you
 ready, said Sir Tristram, to ride with me into the field.
 So when Sir Dinadan was armed he looked upon Sir
 Tristram's helm and on his shield, and when he saw
 so many strokes upon his helm and upon his shield he
 said:  In good time was I thus asleep, for had I been
 with you I must needs for shame there have followed
 you; more for shame than any prowess that is in me;
 that I see well now by those strokes that I should have
 been truly beaten as I was yesterday.  Leave your japes,
 said Sir Tristram, and come off, that [we] were in the
 field again.  What, said Sir Dinadan, is your heart up?
 yesterday ye fared as though ye had dreamed.  So then
 Sir Tristram was arrayed in black harness.  O Jesu,
 said Dinadan, what aileth you this day? meseemeth
 ye be wilder than ye were yesterday.  Then smiled
 Sir Tristram and said to Dinadan:  Await well upon
 me; if ye see me overmatched look that ye be ever
 behind me, and I shall make you ready way by God's
 grace.  So Sir Tristram and Sir Dinadan took their
 horses.  All this espied Sir Palomides, both their going
 and their coming, and so did La Beale Isoud, for she
 knew Sir Tristram above all other.
