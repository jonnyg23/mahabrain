 CHAPTER L
 
 How by treason Sir Tristram was brought to a tournament
 for to have been slain, and how he was put in prison.
 
 
 NOW turn we from this matter, and speak we of Sir Tristram,
 of whom this book is principally of, and leave we
 the king and the queen, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Lamorak, and
 here beginneth the treason of King Mark, that he ordained
 against Sir Tristram.  There was cried by the coasts of
 Cornwall a great tournament and jousts, and all was done
 by Sir Galahalt the haut prince and King Bagdemagus, to
 the intent to slay Launcelot, or else utterly destroy him
 and shame him, because Sir Launcelot had always the
 higher degree, therefore this prince and this king made
 this jousts against Sir Launcelot.  And thus their counsel
 was discovered unto King Mark, whereof he was full
 glad.
 
 Then King Mark bethought him that he would have
 Sir Tristram unto that tournament disguised that no man
 should know him, to that intent that the haut prince
 should ween that Sir Tristram were Sir Launcelot.  So
 at these jousts came in Sir Tristram.  And at that time Sir
 Launcelot was not there, but when they saw a knight
 disguised do such deeds of arms, they weened it had been Sir
 Launcelot.  And in especial King Mark said it was Sir
 Launcelot plainly.  Then they set upon him, both King
 Bagdemagus, and the haut prince, and their knights, that
 it was wonder that ever Sir Tristram might endure that
 pain.  Notwithstanding for all the pain that he had, Sir
 Tristram won the degree at that tournament, and there
 he hurt many knights and bruised them, and they hurt
 him and bruised him wonderly sore.  So when the jousts
 were all done they knew well that it was Sir Tristram de
 Liones; and all that were on King Mark's party were glad
 that Sir Tristram was hurt, and the remnant were sorry of
 his hurt; for Sir Tristram was not so behated as was Sir
 Launcelot within the realm of England.
 
 Then came King Mark unto Sir Tristram and said:
 Fair nephew, I am sorry of your hurts.  Gramercy my
 lord, said Sir Tristram.  Then King Mark made Sir
 Tristram to be put in an horse bier in great sign of love,
 and said:  Fair cousin, I shall be your leech myself.  And
 so he rode forth with Sir Tristram, and brought him to
 a castle by daylight.  And then King Mark made Sir
 Tristram to eat.  And then after he gave him a drink, the
 which as soon as he had drunk he fell asleep.  And when
 it was night he made him to be carried to another castle,
 and there he put him in a strong prison, and there he
 ordained a man and a woman to give him his meat and
 drink.  So there he was a great while.
 
 Then was Sir Tristram missed, and no creature wist
 where he was become.  When La Beale Isoud heard how
 he was missed, privily she went unto Sir Sadok, and prayed
 him to espy where was Sir Tristram.  Then when Sadok
 wist how Sir Tristram was missed, and anon espied that
 he was put in prison by King Mark and the traitors of
 Magouns, then Sadok and two of his cousins laid them in
 an ambushment, fast by the Castle of Tintagil, in arms.
 And as by fortune, there came riding King Mark and four
 of his nephews, and a certain of the traitors of Magouns.
 When Sir Sadok espied them he brake out of the bushment,
 and set there upon them.  And when King Mark
 espied Sir Sadok he fled as fast as he might, and there Sir
 Sadok slew all the four nephews unto King Mark.  But
 these traitors of Magouns slew one of Sadok's cousins with
 a great wound in the neck, but Sadok smote the other to
 the death.  Then Sir Sadok rode upon his way unto a
 castle that was called Liones, and there he espied of the
 treason and felony of King Mark.  So they of that castle
 rode with Sir Sadok till that they came to a castle that
 hight Arbray, and there in the town they found Sir Dinas
 the Seneschal, that was a good knight.  But when Sir
 Sadok had told Sir Dinas of all the treason of King Mark
 he defied such a king, and said he would give up his lands
 that he held of him.  And when he said these words all
 manner knights said as Sir Dinas said.  Then by his advice
 and of Sir Sadok's, he let stuff all the towns and castles
 within the country of Liones, and assembled all the people
 that they might make.
