 CHAPTER XXXIX
 
 How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Nabon, and overcame
 him, and made Sir Segwarides lord of the isle.
 
 IN the meantime there came word that Sir Nabon had made a cry
 that all the people of that isle should be at his castle the
 fifth day after.  And the same day the son of Nabon should be
 made knight, and all the knights of that valley and thereabout
 should be there to joust, and all those of the realm of Logris
 should be there to joust with them of North Wales: and thither
 came five hundred knights, and they of the country brought
 thither Sir Lamorak, and Sir Tristram, and Sir Kehydius, and Sir
 Segwarides, for they durst none otherwise do; and then Sir Nabon
 lent Sir Lamorak horse and armour at Sir Lamorak's desire, and
 Sir Lamorak jousted and did such deeds of arms that Nabon and all
 the people said there was never knight that ever they saw do such
 deeds of arms; for, as the French book saith, he for-jousted all
 that were there, for the most part of five hundred knights, that
 none abode him in his saddle.
 
 Then Sir Nabon proffered to play with him his play:  For I saw
 never no knight do so much upon a day.  I will well, said Sir
 Lamorak, play as I may, but I am weary and sore bruised.  And
 there either gat a spear, but Nabon would not encounter with Sir
 Lamorak, but smote his horse in the forehead, and so slew him;
 and then Sir Lamorak yede on foot, and turned his shield and drew
 his sword, and there began strong battle on foot.  But Sir
 &lt;345&gt;Lamorak was so sore bruised and short breathed, that he
 traced and traversed somewhat aback.  Fair fellow, said Sir
 Nabon, hold thy hand and I shall show thee more courtesy than
 ever I showed knight, because I have seen this day thy noble
 knighthood, and therefore stand thou by, and I will wit whether
 any of thy fellows will have ado with me.  Then when Sir Tristram
 heard that, he stepped forth and said:  Nabon, lend me horse and
 sure armour, and I will have ado with thee.  Well, fellow, said
 Sir Nabon, go thou to yonder pavilion, and arm thee of the best
 thou findest there, and I shall play a marvellous play with thee. 
 Then said Sir Tristram:  Look ye play well, or else peradventure
 I shall learn you a new play.  That is well said, fellow, said
 Sir Nabon.  So when Sir Tristram was armed as him liked best, and
 well shielded and sworded, he dressed to him on foot; for well he
 knew that Sir Nabon would not abide a stroke with a spear,
 therefore he would slay all knights' horses.  Now, fair fellow,
 Sir Nabon, let us play.  So then they fought long on foot,
 tracing and traversing, smiting and foining long without any
 rest.  At the last Sir Nabon prayed him to tell him his name. 
 Sir Nabon, I tell thee my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, a
 knight of Cornwall under King Mark.  Thou art welcome, said Sir
 Nabon, for of all knights I have most desired to fight with thee
 or with Sir Launcelot.
 
 So then they went eagerly together, and Sir Tristram slew Sir
 Nabon, and so forthwith he leapt to his son, and struck off his
 head; and then all the country said they would hold of Sir
 Tristram.  Nay, said Sir Tristram, I will not so; here is a
 worshipful knight, Sir Lamorak de Galis, that for me he shall be
 lord of this country, for he hath done here great deeds of arms. 
 Nay, said Sir Lamorak, I will not be lord of this country, for I
 have not deserved it as well as ye, therefore give ye it where ye
 will, for I will none have.  Well, said Sir Tristram, since ye
 nor I will not have it, let us give it to him that hath not so
 well deserved it.  Do as ye list, said Segwarides, for the gift
 is yours, for I will none have an I had deserved it.  So was it
 given to Segwarides, whereof he thanked &lt;346&gt;them; and so was he
 lord, and worshipfully he did govern it.  And then Sir Segwarides
 delivered all prisoners, and set good governance in that valley;
 and so he returned into Cornwall, and told King Mark and La Beale
 Isoud how Sir Tristram had advanced him to the Isle of Servage,
 and there he proclaimed in all Cornwall of all the adventures of
 these two knights, so was it openly known.  But full woe was La
 Beale Isoud when she heard tell that Sir Tristram was wedded to
 Isoud la Blanche Mains.
