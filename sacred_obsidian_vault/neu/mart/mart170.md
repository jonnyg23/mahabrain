 CHAPTER XVII
 
 How Sir Tristram fought with Sir Bleoberis for a lady, and
 how the lady was put to choice to whom she would go.
 
 THEN Sir Tristram rode more than a pace until that he had
 overtaken him.  Then spake Sir Tristram:  Abide, he said, Knight
 of Arthur's court, bring again that lady, or deliver her to me. 
 I will do neither, said Bleoberis, for I dread no Cornish knight
 so sore that me list to deliver her.  &lt;307&gt;Why, said Sir
 Tristram, may not a Cornish knight do as well as another knight?
 this same day two knights of your court within this three mile
 met with me, and or ever we departed they found a Cornish knight
 good enough for them both.  What were their names? said
 Bleoberis.  They told me, said Sir Tristram, that the one of them
 hight Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and the other hight Dodinas le
 Savage.  Ah, said Sir Bleoberis, have ye met with them? so God me
 help, they were two good knights and men of great worship, and if
 ye have beat them both ye must needs be a good knight; but if it
 so be ye have beat them both, yet shall ye not fear me, but ye
 shall beat me or ever ye have this lady.  Then defend you, said
 Sir Tristram.  So they departed and came together like thunder,
 and either bare other down, horse and all, to the earth.
 
 Then they avoided their horses, and lashed together eagerly with
 swords, and mightily, now tracing and traversing on the right
 hand and on the left hand more than two hours.  And sometime they
 rushed together with such a might that they lay both grovelling
 on the ground.  Then Sir Bleoberis de Ganis stert aback, and said
 thus:  Now, gentle good knight, a while hold your hands, and let
 us speak together.  Say what ye will, said Tristram, and I will
 answer you.  Sir, said Bleoberis, I would wit of whence ye be,
 and of whom ye be come, and what is your name?  So God me help,
 said Sir Tristram, I fear not to tell you my name.  Wit ye well I
 am King Meliodas' son, and my mother is King Mark's sister, and
 my name is Sir Tristram de Liones, and King Mark is mine uncle. 
 Truly, said Bleoberis, I am right glad of you, for ye are he that
 slew Marhaus the knight, hand for hand in an island, for the
 truage of Cornwall; also ye overcame Sir Palamides the good
 knight, at a tournament in an island, where ye beat Sir Gawaine
 and his nine fellows.  So God me help, said Sir Tristram, wit ye
 well that I am the same knight; now I have told you my name, tell
 me yours with good will.  Wit ye well that my name is Sir
 Bleoberis de Ganis, and my brother hight Sir Blamore de Ganis,
 that is called a &lt;308&gt;good knight, and we be sister's children
 unto my lord Sir Launcelot du Lake, that we call one of the best
 knights of the world.  That is truth, said Sir Tristram, Sir
 Launcelot is called peerless of courtesy and of knighthood; and
 for his sake, said Sir Tristram, I will not with my good will
 fight no more with you, for the great love I have to Sir
 Launcelot du Lake.  In good faith, said Bleoberis, as for me I
 will be loath to fight with you; but sithen ye follow me here to
 have this lady, I shall proffer you kindness, courtesy, and
 gentleness right here upon this ground.  This lady shall be
 betwixt us both, and to whom that she will go, let him have her
 in peace.  I will well, said Tristram, for, as I deem, she will
 leave you and come to me.  Ye shall prove it anon, said
 Bleoberis.
