 CHAPTER XXIII
 
 How Sir Percivale was made knight of King Arthur, and
 how a dumb maid spake, and brought him to the
 Round Table.
 
 
 NOW turn we again unto Sir Lamorak, and speak we of
 his brethren, Sir Tor, which was King Pellinore's first son
 and begotten of Aryes, wife of the cowherd, for he was a
 bastard; and Sir Aglovale was his first son begotten in
 wedlock; Sir Lamorak, Dornar, Percivale, these were his
 sons too in wedlock.  So when King Mark and Sir Tristram
 were departed from the court there was made great
 dole and sorrow for the departing of Sir Tristram.  Then
 the king and his knights made no manner of joys eight days
 after.  And at the eight days' end there came to the court
 a knight with a young squire with him.  And when this
 knight was unarmed, he went to the king and required him
 to make the young squire a knight.  Of what lineage is he
 come? said King Arthur.  Sir, said the knight, he is the
 son of King Pellinore, that did you some time good service,
 and he is a brother unto Sir Lamorak de Galis, the good
 knight.  Well, said the king, for what cause desire ye that
 of me that I should make him knight?  Wit you well, my
 lord the king, that this young squire is brother to me as
 well as to Sir Lamorak, and my name is Aglavale.  Sir
 Aglavale, said Arthur, for the love of Sir Lamorak, and
 for his father's love, he shall be made knight to-morrow.
 Now tell me, said Arthur, what is his name?  Sir, said
 the knight, his name is Percivale de Galis.  So on the
 morn the king made him knight in Camelot.  But the
 king and all the knights thought it would be long or that
 he proved a good knight.
 
 Then at the dinner, when the king was set at the table,
 and every knight after he was of prowess, the king
 commanded him to be set among mean knights; and so was
 Sir Percivale set as the king commanded.  Then was
 there a maiden in the queen's court that was come of high
 blood, and she was dumb and never spake word.  Right
 so she came straight into the hall, and went unto Sir
 Percivale, and took him by the hand and said aloud, that
 the king and all the knights might hear it:  Arise, Sir
 Percivale, the noble knight and God's knight, and go with
 me; and so he did.  And there she brought him to the
 right side of the Siege Perilous, and said, Fair knight, take
 here thy siege, for that siege appertaineth to thee and to
 none other.  Right so she departed and asked a priest.
 And as she was confessed and houselled then she died.
 Then the king and all the court made great joy of Sir
 Percivale.
