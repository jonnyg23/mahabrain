 CHAPTER LXV
 
 How Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides met Breuse Saunce
 Pit<e>, and how Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud went
 unto Lonazep.
 
 
 AND then Sir Tristram desired Sir Palomides to ride into
 the fields and woods.  So they were accorded to repose
 them in the forest.  And when they had played them a
 great while they rode unto a fair well; and anon they
 were ware of an armed knight that came riding against
 them, and there either saluted other.  Then this armed
 knight spake to Sir Tristram, and asked what were these
 knights that were lodged in Joyous Gard.  I wot not
 what they are, said Sir Tristram.  What knights be ye?
 said that knight, for meseemeth ye be no knights errant,
 because ye ride unarmed.  Whether we be knights or not
 we list not to tell thee our name.  Wilt thou not tell me
 thy name? said that knight; then keep thee, for thou
 shalt die of my hands.  And therewith he got his spear
 in his hands, and would have run Sir Tristram through.
 That saw Sir Palomides, and smote his horse traverse in
 midst of the side, that man and horse fell to the earth.
 And therewith Sir Palomides alighted and pulled out his
 sword to have slain him.  Let be, said Sir Tristram, slay
 him not, the knight is but a fool, it were shame to slay
 him.  But take away his spear, said Sir Tristram, and let
 him take his horse and go where that he will.
 
 So when this knight arose he groaned sore of the fall,
 and so he took his horse, and when he was up he turned
 then his horse, and required Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides
 to tell him what knights they were.  Now wit ye well,
 said Sir Tristram, that my name is Sir Tristram de Liones,
 and this knight's name is Sir Palomides.  When he wist
 what they were he took his horse with the spurs, because
 they should not ask him his name, and so rode fast away
 through thick and thin.  Then came there by them a
 knight with a bended shield of azure, whose name was
 Epinogris, and he came toward them a great wallop.
 Whither are ye riding? said Sir Tristram.  My fair lords,
 said Epinogris, I follow the falsest knight that beareth
 the life; wherefore I require you tell me whether ye saw
 him, for he beareth a shield with a case of red over it.  So
 God me help, said Tristram, such a knight departed from
 us not a quarter of an hour agone; we pray you tell us
 his name.  Alas, said Epinogris, why let ye him escape
 from you? and he is so great a foe unto all errant
 knights: his name is Breuse Saunce Pit<e>.  Ah, fie for
 shame, said Sir Palomides, alas that ever he escaped mine
 hands, for he is the man in the world that I hate most.
 Then every knight made great sorrow to other; and so
 Epinogris departed and followed the chase after him.
 
 Then Sir Tristram and his three fellows rode unto
 Joyous Gard; and there Sir Tristram talked unto Sir
 Palomides of his battle, how he sped at the Red City, and
 as ye have heard afore so was it ended.  Truly, said Sir
 Tristram, I am glad ye have well sped, for ye have done
 worshipfully.  Well, said Sir Tristram, we must forward
 to-morn.  And then he devised how it should be; and
 Sir Tristram devised to send his two pavilions to set
 them fast by the well of Lonazep, and therein shall be
 the queen La Beale Isoud.  It is well said, said Sir
 Dinadan, but when Sir Palomides heard of that his heart
 was ravished out of measure: notwithstanding he said
 but little.  So when they came to Joyous Gard Sir
 Palomides would not have gone into the castle, but as
 Sir Tristram took him by the finger, and led him into
 the castle.  And when Sir Palomides saw La Beale Isoud
 he was ravished so that he might unnethe speak.  So they
 went unto meat, but Palomides might not eat, and there
 was all the cheer that might be had.  And on the morn
 they were apparelled to ride toward Lonazep.
 
 So Sir Tristram had three squires, and La Beale Isoud
 had three gentlewomen, and both the queen and they
 were richly apparelled; and other people had they none
 with them, but varlets to bear their shields and their
 spears.  And thus they rode forth.  So as they rode they
 saw afore them a rout of knights; it was the knight
 Galihodin with twenty knights with him.  Fair fellows,
 said Galihodin, yonder come four knights, and a rich and
 a well fair lady: I am in will to take that lady from
 them.  That is not of the best counsel, said one of
 Galihodin's men, but send ye to them and wit what they
 will say; and so it was done.  There came a squire unto
 Sir Tristram, and asked them whether they would joust
 or else to lose their lady.  Not so, said Sir Tristram,
 tell your lord I bid him come as many as we be, and
 win her and take her.  Sir, said Palomides, an it please
 you let me have this deed, and I shall undertake them
 all four.  I will that ye have it, said Sir Tristram, at
 your pleasure.  Now go and tell your lord Galihodin,
 that this same knight will encounter with him and his
 fellows.
