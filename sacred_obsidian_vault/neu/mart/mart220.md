 CHAPTER XXVII
 
 How damosel Bragwaine found Tristram sleeping by a well,
 and how she delivered letters to him from La Beale Isoud.
 
 AND then he pulled off his helm and washed his visage and his
 hands, and so he fell asleep.  In the meanwhile came a damosel
 that had sought Sir Tristram many ways and days within this land. 
 And when she came to the well she looked upon him, and had
 forgotten him as in remembrance of Sir Tristram, but by his horse
 she knew him, that hight Passe-Brewel that had been Sir
 Tristram's horse many years.  For when he was mad in the forest
 Sir Fergus kept him.  So this lady, Dame Bragwaine, abode still
 till he was awake.  So when she saw him wake she saluted him, and
 he her again, for either knew other of old acquaintance; then she
 told him how she had sought him long and broad, and there she
 told him how she had letters from Queen La Beale Isoud.  Then
 anon Sir Tristram read them, and wit ye well he was glad, for
 therein was many a piteous complaint.  Then Sir Tristram said: 
 Lady Bragwaine, ye shall ride with me till that tournament be
 done at the Castle of Maidens, and then shall bear letters and
 tidings with you.  And then Sir Tristram took his horse and
 sought lodging, and there he met with a good ancient knight and
 prayed him to lodge with him.  Right so came Gouvernail unto Sir
 Tristram, that was glad of that lady.  So this old knight's name
 was Sir Pellounes, and he told of the great tournament that
 should be at the Castle of Maidens.  And there Sir Launcelot and
 thirty-two knights of his blood had ordained shields of Cornwall. 
 And right so there came one unto Sir Pellounes, and told him that
 Sir Persides de Bloise was come home; then that knight held up
 his hands and thanked God of his coming home.  And there Sir
 Pellounes told Sir Tristram that in two years he had not seen his
 son, Sir Persides.  Sir, said Sir Tristram, I know your son well
 enough for a good knight.
 
 &lt;399&gt;
 So on a time Sir Tristram and Sir Persides came to their lodging
 both at once, and so they unarmed them, and put upon them their
 clothing.  And then these two knights each welcomed other.  And
 when Sir Persides understood that Sir Tristram was of Cornwall,
 he said he was once in Cornwall:  And there I jousted afore King
 Mark; and so it happed me at that time to overthrow ten knights,
 and then came to me Sir Tristram de Liones and overthrew me, and
 took my lady away from me, and that shall I never forget, but I
 shall remember me an ever I see my time.  Ah, said Sir Tristram,
 now I understand that ye hate Sir Tristram.  What deem ye, ween
 ye that Sir Tristram is not able to withstand your malice?  Yes,
 said Sir Persides, I know well that Sir Tristram is a noble
 knight and a much better knight than I, yet shall I not owe him
 my good will.  Right as they stood thus talking at a bay-window
 of that castle, they saw many knights riding to and fro toward
 the tournament.  And then was Sir Tristram ware of a likely
 knight riding upon a great black horse, and a black-covered
 shield.  What knight is that, said Sir Tristram, with the black
 horse and the black shield? he seemeth a good knight.  I know him
 well, said Sir Persides, he is one of the best knights of the
 world.  Then is it Sir Launcelot, said Tristram.  Nay, said Sir
 Persides, it is Sir Palomides, that is yet unchristened.
