 CHAPTER XIII
 
 How Sir Lamorak met with Sir Meliagaunce, and fought
 together for the beauty of Dame Guenever.
 
 RIGHT so as they stood talking thus Sir Lamorak was ware how Sir
 Launcelot came riding straight toward them; then Sir Lamorak
 saluted him, and he him again.  And then Sir Lamorak asked Sir
 Launcelot if there were anything that he might do for him in
 these marches.  Nay, said Sir Launcelot, not at this time I thank
 you.  Then either departed from other, and Sir Lamorak rode again
 thereas he left the two knights, and then he found them hid in
 the leaved wood.  Fie on you, said Sir Lamorak, false cowards,
 pity and shame it is that any of you should take the high order
 of knighthood.  So Sir Lamorak departed from them, and within a
 while he met with Sir Meliagaunce.  And then Sir Lamorak asked
 him why he loved Queen Guenever as he did:  For I was not far
 from you when ye made your complaint by the chapel.  Did ye so?
 said Sir Meliagaunce, then will I abide by it:  I love Queen
 Guenever, what will ye with it?  I will prove and make good that
 she is the fairest lady and most of beauty in the world.  As to
 that, said Sir Lamorak, I say nay thereto, for Queen Morgawse of
 Orkney, mother to Sir Gawaine, and his mother is the fairest
 queen and lady that beareth the life.  That is not so, said Sir
 Meliagaunce, and that will I prove with my hands upon thy body. 
 Will ye so? said Sir Lamorak, and in a better quarrel keep I not
 to fight.  Then they departed either from other in great wrath. 
 And then they came riding together as it had been thunder, and
 either smote other so sore that their horses fell backward to the
 earth.  And then they avoided their horses, and dressed their
 shields, and drew their swords.  And then they hurtled together
 as wild boars, and thus they fought a great while.  For
 Meliagaunce was a good man and of great might, but Sir Lamorak
 was &lt;373&gt;hard big for him, and put him always aback, but either
 had wounded other sore.
 
 And as they stood thus fighting, by fortune came Sir Launcelot
 and Sir Bleoberis riding.  And then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt
 them, and asked them for what cause they fought so together:  And
 ye are both knights of King Arthur!
