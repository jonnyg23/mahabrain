 CHAPTER XXXIII
 
 How Anglides, Boudwin's wife, escaped with her young son,
 Alisander le Orphelin, and came to the Castle of Arundel.
 
 
 NOTWITHSTANDING, when King Mark had done this
 deed, yet he thought to do more vengeance; and with his
 sword in his hand, he sought from chamber to chamber,
 to seek Anglides and her young son.  And when she was
 missed he called a good knight that hight Sadok, and
 charged him by pain of death to fetch Anglides again and
 her young son.  So Sir Sadok departed and rode after
 Anglides.  And within ten mile he overtook her, and
 bade her turn again and ride with him to King Mark.
 Alas, fair knight, she said, what shall ye win by my son's
 death or by mine?  I have had overmuch harm and too
 great a loss.  Madam, said Sadok, of your loss is dole
 and pity; but madam, said Sadok, would ye depart out
 of this country with your son, and keep him till he be of
 age, that he may revenge his father's death, then would
 I suffer you to depart from me, so you promise me
 to revenge the death of Prince Boudwin.  Ah, gentle
 knight, Jesu thank thee, and if ever my son, Alisander le
 Orphelin, live to be a knight, he shall have his father's
 doublet and his shirt with the bloody marks, and I shall
 give him such a charge that he shall remember it while he
 liveth.  And therewithal Sadok departed from her, and
 either betook other to God.  And when Sadok came to
 King Mark he told him faithfully that he had drowned
 young Alisander her son; and thereof King Mark was
 full glad.
 
 Now turn we unto Anglides, that rode both night and
 day by adventure out of Cornwall, and little and in few
 places she rested; but ever she drew southward to the
 seaside, till by fortune she came to a castle that is called
 Magouns, and now it is called Arundel, in Sussex.  And
 the Constable of the castle welcomed her, and said she
 was welcome to her own castle; and there was Anglides 2t
 worshipfully received, for the Constable's wife was nigh
 her cousin, and the Constable's name was Bellangere; and
 that same Constable told Anglides that the same castle
 was hers by right inheritance.  Thus Anglides endured
 years and winters, till Alisander was big and strong;
 there was none so wight in all that country, neither there
 was none that might do no manner of mastery afore him.
