 CHAPTER V
 
 How Sir Launcelot came to the court and heard of La Cote
 Male Taile, and how he followed after him, and how
 La Cote Male Taile was prisoner.
 
 HERE leave we off a while of this tale, and speak we of Sir
 Launcelot du Lake,[*9] that when he was come to the court of King
 Arthur, then heard he tell of the young knight La Cote Male
 Taile, how he slew the lion, and how he took upon him the
 adventure of the black shield, the which was named at that time
 the hardiest adventure of the world.  So God me save, said Sir
 Launcelot unto many of his fellows, it was shame to all the noble
 knights to suffer such a young knight to take such adventure upon
 him for his destruction; for I will that ye wit, said Sir
 Launcelot, that that damosel Maledisant hath borne that shield
 many a day for to seek the most proved knights, and that was she
 that Breuse Saunce Pite took that shield from her, and after
 Tristram de Liones rescued that shield from him and &lt;359&gt;gave it
 to the damosel again, a little afore that time that Sir Tristram
 fought with my nephew Sir Blamore de Ganis, for a quarrel that
 was betwixt the King of Ireland and him.  Then many knights were
 sorry that Sir La Cote Male Taile was gone forth to that
 adventure.  Truly, said Sir Launcelot, I cast me to ride after
 him.  And within seven days Sir Launcelot overtook La Cote Male
 Taile, and then he saluted him and the damosel Maledisant.  And
 when Sir Mordred saw Sir Launcelot, then he left their
 fellowship; and so Sir Launcelot rode with them all a day, and
 ever that damosel rebuked La Cote Male Taile; and then Sir
 Launcelot answered for him, then she left off, and rebuked Sir
 Launcelot.

 So this meantime Sir Tristram sent by a damosel a letter unto Sir
 Launcelot, excusing him of the wedding of Isoud la Blanche Mains;
 and said in the letter, as he was a true knight he had never ado
 fleshly with Isoud la Blanche Mains; and passing courteously and
 gentily Sir Tristram wrote unto Sir Launcelot, ever beseeching
 him to be his good friend and unto La Beale Isoud of Cornwall,
 and that Sir Launcelot would excuse him if that ever he saw her. 
 And within short time by the grace of God, said Sir Tristram,
 that he would speak with La Beale Isoud, and with him right
 hastily.  Then Sir Launcelot departed from the damosel and from
 Sir La Cote Male Taile, for to oversee that letter, and to write
 another letter unto Sir Tristram de Liones.
 
 And in the meanwhile La Cote Male Taile rode with the damosel
 until they came to a castle that hight Pendragon; and there were
 six knights stood afore him, and one of them proffered to joust
 with La Cote Male Taile.  And there La Cote Male Taile smote him
 over his horse's croup.  And then the five knights set upon him
 all at once with their spears, and there they smote La Cote Male
 Taile down, horse and man.  And then they alighted suddenly, and
 set their hands upon him all at once, and took him prisoner, and
 so led him unto the castle and kept him as prisoner.
 
 And on the morn Sir Launcelot arose, and delivered &lt;360&gt;the
 damosel with letters unto Sir Tristram, and then he took his way
 after La Cote Male Taile; and by the way upon a bridge there was
 a knight proffered Sir Launcelot to joust, and Sir Launcelot
 smote him down, and then they fought upon foot a noble battle
 together, and a mighty; and at the last Sir Launcelot smote him
 down grovelling upon his hands and his knees.  And then that
 knight yielded him, and Sir Launcelot received him fair.  Sir,
 said the knight, I require thee tell me your name, for much my
 heart giveth unto you.  Nay, said Sir Launcelot, as at this time
 I will not tell you my name, unless then that ye tell me your
 name.  Certainly, said the knight, my name is Sir Nerovens, that
 was made knight of my lord Sir Launcelot du Lake.  Ah, Nerovens
 de Lile, said Sir Launcelot, I am right glad that ye are proved a
 good knight, for now wit ye well my name is Sir Launcelot du
 Lake.  Alas, said Sir Nerovens de Lile, what have I done!  And
 therewithal flatling he fell to his feet, and would have kissed
 them, but Sir Launcelot would not let him; and then either made
 great joy of other.  And then Sir Nerovens told Sir Launcelot
 that he should not go by the Castle of Pendragon:  For there is a
 lord, a mighty knight, and many knights with him, and this night
 I heard say that they took a knight prisoner yesterday that rode
 with a damosel, and they say he is a Knight of the Round Table.
