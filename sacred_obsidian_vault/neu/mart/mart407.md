 CHAPTER I
 
 How Sir Galahad fought at a tournament, and how he was
 known of Sir Gawaine and Sir Ector de Maris.
 
 
 NOW saith this story, when Galahad had rescued Percivale
 from the twenty knights, he yede tho into a waste forest
 wherein he rode many journeys; and he found many
 adventures the which he brought to an end, whereof the
 story maketh here no mention.  Then he took his way
 to the sea on a day, and it befell as he passed by a castle
 where was a wonder tournament, but they without had
 done so much that they within were put to the worse, yet
 were they within good knights enough.  When Galahad
 saw that those within were at so great a mischief that men
 slew them at the entry of the castle, then he thought to
 help them, and put a spear forth and smote the first that
 he fell to the earth, and the spear brake to pieces.  Then
 he drew his sword and smote thereas they were thickest,
 and so he did wonderful deeds of arms that all they
 marvelled.  Then it happed that Gawaine and Sir Ector
 de Maris were with the knights without.  But when they
 espied the white shield with the red cross the one said to
 the other:  Yonder is the good knight, Sir Galahad, the
 haut prince: now he should be a great fool which should
 meet with him to fight.  So by adventure he came by Sir
 Gawaine, and he smote him so hard that he clave his helm
 and the coif of iron unto his head, so that Gawaine fell
 to the earth; but the stroke was so great that it slanted
 down to the earth and carved the horse's shoulder in two.
 
 When Ector saw Gawaine down he drew him aside,
 and thought it no wisdom for to abide him, and also for
 natural love, that he was his uncle.  Thus through his
 great hardiness he beat aback all the knights without.
 And then they within came out and chased them all
 about.  But when Galahad saw there would none turn
 again he stole away privily, so that none wist where he was
 become.  Now by my head, said Gawaine to Ector, now
 are the wonders true that were said of Launcelot du Lake,
 that the sword which stuck in the stone should give me
 such a buffet that I would not have it for the best castle
 in this world; and soothly now it is proved true, for
 never ere had I such a stroke of man's hand.  Sir, said
 Ector, meseemeth your quest is done.  And yours is not
 done, said Gawaine, but mine is done, I shall seek no
 further.  Then Gawaine was borne into a castle and unarmed
 him, and laid him in a rich bed, and a leech found
 that he might live, and to be whole within a month.
 Thus Gawaine and Ector abode together, for Sir Ector
 would not away till Gawaine were whole.
 
 And the good knight, Galahad, rode so long till he
 came that night to the Castle of Carboneck; and it befell
 him thus that he was benighted in an hermitage.  So the
 good man was fain when he saw he was a knight-errant.
 Tho when they were at rest there came a gentlewoman
 knocking at the door, and called Galahad, and so the good
 man came to the door to wit what she would.  Then she
 called the hermit:  Sir Ulfin, I am a gentlewoman that
 would speak with the knight which is with you.  Then
 the good man awaked Galahad, and bade him:  Arise, and
 speak with a gentlewoman that seemeth hath great need
 of you.  Then Galahad went to her and asked her what
 she would.  Galahad, said she, I will that ye arm you,
 and mount upon your horse and follow me, for I shall
 show you within these three days the highest adventure
 that ever any knight saw.  Anon Galahad armed him, and
 took his horse, and commended him to God, and bade the
 gentlewoman go, and he would follow thereas she liked.
