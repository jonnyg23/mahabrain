 CHAPTER XI
 
 How Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine entered in the field
 against them of King Arthur's court, and how Launcelot
 was hurt.
 
 
 NOW, said Sir Launcelot, an ye will help me a little, ye
 shall see yonder fellowship that chaseth now these men in
 our side, that they shall go as fast backward as they went
 forward.  Sir, spare not, said Sir Lavaine, for I shall do
 what I may.  Then Sir Launcelot and Sir Lavaine came
 in at the thickest of the press, and there Sir Launcelot
 smote down Sir Brandiles, Sir Sagramore, Sir Dodinas, Sir
 Kay, Sir Griflet, and all this he did with one spear; and
 Sir Lavaine smote down Sir Lucan le Butler and Sir
 Bedevere.  And then Sir Launcelot gat another spear,
 and there he smote down Sir Agravaine, Sir Gaheris, and
 Sir Mordred, and Sir Meliot de Logris; and Sir Lavaine
 smote Ozanna le Cure Hardy.  And then Sir Launcelot
 drew his sword, and there he smote on the right hand and
 on the left hand, and by great force he unhorsed Sir
 Safere, Sir Epinogris, and Sir Galleron; and then the
 knights of the Table Round withdrew them aback, after
 they had gotten their horses as well as they might.  O
 mercy Jesu, said Sir Gawaine, what knight is yonder that
 doth so marvellous deeds of arms in that field?  I wot
 well what he is, said King Arthur, but as at this time I
 will not name him.  Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I would say it
 were Sir Launcelot by his riding and his buffets that I see
 him deal, but ever meseemeth it should not be he, for that
 he beareth the red sleeve upon his head; for I wist him
 never bear token at no jousts, of lady nor gentlewoman.
 Let him be, said King Arthur, he will be better known,
 and do more, or ever he depart.
 
 Then the party that was against King Arthur were
 well comforted, and then they held them together that
 beforehand were sore rebuked.  Then Sir Bors, Sir Ector
 de Maris, and Sir Lionel called unto them the knights of
 their blood, as Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis, Sir
 Aliduke, Sir Galihud, Sir Galihodin, Sir Bellangere le
 Beuse.  So these nine knights of Sir Launcelot's kin
 thrust in mightily, for they were all noble knights; and
 they, of great hate and despite that they had unto him,
 thought to rebuke that noble knight Sir Launcelot, and
 Sir Lavaine, for they knew them not; and so they came
 hurling together, and smote down many knights of Northgalis
 and of Northumberland.  And when Sir Launcelot
 saw them fare so, he gat a spear in his hand; and there
 encountered with him all at once Sir Bors, Sir Ector, and
 Sir Lionel, and all they three smote him at once with
 their spears.  And with force of themself they smote Sir
 Launcelot's horse to the earth; and by misfortune Sir
 Bors smote Sir Launcelot through the shield into the side,
 and the spear brake, and the head left still in his side.
 
 When Sir Lavaine saw his master lie on the ground,
 he ran to the King of Scots and smote him to the earth;
 and by great force he took his horse, and brought him to
 Sir Launcelot, and maugre of them all he made him to
 mount upon that horse.  And then Launcelot gat a spear
 in his hand, and there he smote Sir Bors, horse and man,
 to the earth.  In the same wise he served Sir Ector and
 Sir Lionel; and Sir Lavaine smote down Sir Blamore de
 Ganis.  And then Sir Launcelot drew his sword, for he
 felt himself so sore y-hurt that he weened there to have
 had his death.  And then he smote Sir Bleoberis such a
 buffet on the helm that he fell down to the earth in a
 swoon.  And in the same wise he served Sir Aliduke and
 Sir Galihud.  And Sir Lavaine smote down Sir Bellangere,
 that was the son of Alisander le Orphelin.
 
 And by this was Sir Bors horsed, and then he came
 with Sir Ector and Sir Lionel, and all they three smote
 with swords upon Sir Launcelot's helmet.  And when he
 felt their buffets and his wound, the which was so grievous,
 then he thought to do what he might while he might
 endure.  And then he gave Sir Bors such a buffet that he
 made him bow his head passing low; and therewithal he
 raced off his helm, and might have slain him; and so
 pulled him down, and in the same wise he served Sir
 Ector and Sir Lionel.  For as the book saith he might
 have slain them, but when he saw their visages his heart
 might not serve him thereto, but left them there.  And
 then afterward he hurled into the thickest press of them
 all, and did there the marvelloust deeds of arms that ever
 man saw or heard speak of, and ever Sir Lavaine, the
 good knight, with him.  And there Sir Launcelot with
 his sword smote down and pulled down, as the French
 book maketh mention, mo than thirty knights, and the
 most part were of the Table Round; and Sir Lavaine did
 full well that day, for he smote down ten knights of the
 Table Round.
