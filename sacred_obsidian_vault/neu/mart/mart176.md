 CHAPTER XXIII
 
 How Sir Blamore desired Tristram to slay him, and how Sir
 Tristram spared him, and how they took appointment.
 
 THEN when Sir Blamore might speak, he said thus:  Sir Tristram de
 Liones, I require thee, as thou art a noble knight, and the best
 knight that ever I found, that thou wilt slay me out, for I would
 not live to be made lord of all the earth, for I have liefer die
 with worship than live with shame; and needs, Sir Tristram, thou
 must slay me, or else thou shalt never win the field, for I will
 never say the loath word.  And therefore if thou dare slay me,
 slay me, I require thee.  When Sir Tristram heard him say so
 knightly, he wist not what to do with him; he remembering him of
 both parties, of what blood he was come, and for Sir Launcelot's
 sake he would be loath to slay him; and in the other party in no
 wise he might not choose, but that he must make him to say the
 loath word, or else to slay him.
 
 Then Sir Tristram stert aback, and went to the kings that were
 judges, and there he kneeled down to-fore them, and besought them
 for their worships, and for King Arthur's and Sir Launcelot's
 sake, that they would take this matter in their hands.  For, my
 fair lords, said Sir Tristram, it were shame and pity that this
 noble knight that yonder lieth should be slain; for ye hear well,
 shamed will he not be, and I pray to God that he never be slain
 nor shamed for &lt;317&gt;me.  And as for the king for whom I fight
 for, I shall require him, as I am his true champion and true
 knight in this field, that he will have mercy upon this good
 knight.  So God me help, said King Anguish, I will for your sake;
 Sir Tristram, be ruled as ye will have me, for I know you for my
 true knight; and therefore I will heartily pray the kings that be
 here as judges to take it in their hands.  And the kings that
 were judges called Sir Bleoberis to them, and asked him his
 advice.  My lords, said Bleoberis, though my brother be beaten,
 and hath the worse through might of arms, I dare say, though Sir
 Tristram hath beaten his body he hath not beaten his heart, and I
 thank God he is not shamed this day; and rather than he should be
 shamed I require you, said Bleoberis, let Sir Tristram slay him
 out.  It shall not be so, said the kings, for his part adversary,
 both the king and the champion, have pity of Sir Blamore's
 knighthood.  My lords, said Bleoberis, I will right well as ye
 will.
 
 Then the kings called the King of Ireland, and found him goodly
 and treatable.  And then, by all their advices, Sir Tristram and
 Sir Bleoberis took up Sir Blamore, and the two brethren were
 accorded with King Anguish, and kissed and made friends for ever. 
 And then Sir Blamore and Sir Tristram kissed together, and there
 they made their oaths that they would never none of them two
 brethren fight with Sir Tristram, and Sir Tristram made the same
 oath.  And for that gentle battle all the blood of Sir Launcelot
 loved Sir Tristram for ever.
 
 Then King Anguish and Sir Tristram took their leave, and sailed
 into Ireland with great noblesse and joy.  So when they were in
 Ireland the king let make it known throughout all the land how
 and in what manner Sir Tristram had done for him.  Then the queen
 and all that there were made the most of him that they might. 
 But the joy that La Beale Isoud made of Sir Tristram there might
 no tongue tell, for of all men earthly she loved him most.
