 CHAPTER LXXX
 
 How Sir Tristram turned to King Arthur's side, and how
 Palomides would not.
 
 
 THEN Sir Tristram called unto him Sir Palomides, Sir
 Gareth, and Sir Dinadan, and said thus to them:  My fair
 fellows, wit ye well that I will turn unto King Arthur's
 party, for I saw never so few men do so well, and it will
 be shame unto us knights that be of the Round Table
 to see our lord King Arthur, and that noble knight Sir
 Launcelot, to be dishonoured.  It will be well done, said
 Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan.  Do your best, said Palomides,
 for I will not change my party that I came in withal.
 That is for my sake, said Sir Tristram; God speed you in
 your journey.  And so departed Sir Palomides from them.
 Then Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Dinadan, turned with Sir
 Launcelot.  And then Sir Launcelot smote down the King
 of Ireland quite from his horse; and so Sir Launcelot
 smote down the King of Scots, and the King of Wales;
 and then Sir Arthur ran unto Sir Palomides and smote him
 quite from his horse; and then Sir Tristram bare down
 all that he met.  Sir Gareth and Sir Dinadan did there as
 noble knights; then all the parties began to flee.  Alas, said
 Palomides, that ever I should see this day, for now have
 I lost all the worship that I won; and then Sir Palomides
 went his way wailing, and so withdrew him till he came
 to a well, and there he put his horse from him, and did off
 his armour, and wailed and wept like as he had been a wood
 man.  Then many knights gave the prize to Sir Tristram,
 and there were many that gave the prize unto Sir Launcelot. 
 Fair lords, said Sir Tristram, I thank you of the
 honour ye would give me, but I pray you heartily that ye
 would give your voice to Sir Launcelot, for by my faith
 said Sir Tristram, I will give Sir Launcelot my voice.  But
 Sir Launcelot would not have it, and so the prize was
 given betwixt them both.
 
 Then every man rode to his lodging, and Sir Bleoberis
 and Sir Ector rode with Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud
 unto their pavilions.  Then as Sir Palomides was at the
 well wailing and weeping, there came by him flying the
 kings of Wales and of Scotland, and they saw Sir Palomides
 in that arage.  Alas, said they, that so noble a man as ye
 be should be in this array.  And then those kings gat
 Sir Palomides' horse again, and made him to arm him
 and mount upon his horse, and so he rode with them,
 making great dole.  So when Sir Palomides came nigh the
 pavilions thereas Sir Tristram and La Beale Isoud was in,
 then Sir Palomides prayed the two kings to abide him
 there the while that he spake with Sir Tristram.  And
 when he came to the port of the pavilions, Sir Palomides
 said on high:  Where art thou, Sir Tristram de Liones?
 Sir, said Dinadan, that is Palomides.  What, Sir Palomides,
 will ye not come in here among us?  Fie on thee
 traitor, said Palomides, for wit you well an it were
 daylight as it is night I should slay thee, mine own hands.
 And if ever I may get thee, said Palomides, thou shalt
 die for this day's deed.  Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram,
 ye wite me with wrong, for had ye done as I did ye had
 won worship.  But sithen ye give me so large warning
 I shall be well ware of you.  Fie on thee, traitor, said
 Palomides, and therewith departed.
 
 Then on the morn Sir Tristram, Bleoberis, and Sir
 Ector de Maris, Sir Gareth, Sir Dinadan, what by water
 and what by land, they brought La Beale Isoud unto
 Joyous Gard, and there reposed them a seven night, and
 made all the mirths and disports that they could devise.
 And King Arthur and his knights drew unto Camelot,
 and Sir Palomides rode with the two kings; and ever
 he made the greatest dole that any man could think, for
 he was not all only so dolorous for the departing from La
 Beale Isoud, but he was a part as sorrowful to depart
 from the fellowship of Sir Tristram; for Sir Tristram was
 so kind and so gentle that when Sir Palomides remembered
 him thereof he might never be merry.
