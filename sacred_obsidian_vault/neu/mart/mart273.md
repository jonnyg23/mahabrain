 CHAPTER XXXVI
 
 How Sir Alisander won the prize at a tournament, and of
 Morgan le Fay: and how he fought with Sir Malgrin,
 and slew him.
 
 
 NOW turn we again unto Sir Alisander, that at his departing
 his mother took with him his father's bloody shirt.
 So that he bare with him always till his death day, in
 tokening to think of his father's death.  So was Alisander
 purposed to ride to London, by the counsel of Sir Tristram,
 to Sir Launcelot.  And by fortune he went by the
 seaside, and rode wrong.  And there he won at a tournament
 the gree that King Carados made.  And there he
 smote down King Carados and twenty of his knights, and
 also Sir Safere, a good knight that was Sir Palomides'
 brother, the good knight.  All this saw a damosel, and
 saw the best knight joust that ever she saw.  And ever as
 he smote down knights he made them to swear to wear
 none harness in a twelvemonth and a day.  This is well
 said, said Morgan le Fay, this is the knight that I would
 fain see.  And so she took her palfrey, and rode a great
 while, and then she rested her in her pavilion.  So there
 came four knights, two were armed, and two were unarmed,
 and they told Morgan le Fay their names: the first
 was Elias de Gomeret, the second was Cari de Gomeret,
 those were armed; that other twain were of Camiliard,
 cousins unto Queen Guenever, and that one hight Guy,
 and that other hight Garaunt, those were unarmed.  There
 these four knights told Morgan le Fay how a young
 knight had smitten them down before a castle For the
 maiden of that castle said that he was but late made knight,
 and young.  But as we suppose, but if it were Sir Tristram,
 or Sir Launcelot, or Sir Lamorak, the good knight, there
 is none that might sit him a buffet with a spear.  Well,
 said Morgan le Fay, I shall meet that knight or it be long
 time, an he dwell in that country.
 
 So turn we to the damosel of the castle, that when
 Alisander le Orphelin had forjousted the four knights,
 she called him to her, and said thus:  Sir knight, wilt thou
 for my sake joust and fight with a knight, for my sake,
 of this country, that is and hath been long time an evil
 neighbour to me?  His name is Malgrin, and he will not
 suffer me to be married in no manner wise for all that I
 can do, or any knight for my sake.  Damosel, said Alisander,
 an he come whiles I am here I will fight with him,
 and my poor body for your sake I will jeopard.  And
 therewithal she sent for him, for he was at her commandment.
 And when either had a sight of other, they made
 them ready for to joust, and they came together eagerly,
 and Malgrin brised his spear upon Alisander, and Alisander
 smote him again so hard that he bare him quite from his
 saddle to the earth.  But this Malgrin arose lightly, and
 dressed his shield and drew his sword, and bade him alight,
 saying:  Though thou have the better of me on horseback,
 thou shalt find that I shall endure like a knight on foot.
 It is well said, said Alisander; and so lightly he avoided
 his horse and betook him to his varlet.  And then they
 rushed together like two boars, and laid on their helms
 and shields long time, by the space of three hours, that
 never man could say which was the better knight.
 
 And in the meanwhile came Morgan le Fay to the
 damosel of the castle, and they beheld the battle.  But
 this Malgrin was an old roted knight, and he was called
 one of the dangerous knights of the world to do battle on
 foot, but on horseback there were many better.  And ever
 this Malgrin awaited to slay Alisander, and so wounded
 him wonderly sore, that it was marvel that ever he might
 stand, for he had bled so much blood; for Alisander
 fought wildly, and not wittily.  And that other was a
 felonious knight, and awaited him, and smote him sore.
 And sometime they rushed together with their shields,
 like two boars or rams, and fell grovelling both to the
 earth.  Now knight, said Malgrin, hold thy hand a while,
 and tell me what thou art.  I will not, said Alisander, but
 if me list: but tell me thy name, and why thou keepest
 this country, or else thou shalt die of my hands.  Wit
 thou well, said Malgrin, that for this maiden's love, of this
 castle, I have slain ten good knights by mishap; and by
 outrage and orgulit<e> of myself I have slain ten other
 knights.  So God me help, said Alisander, this is the
 foulest confession that ever I heard knight make, nor
 never heard I speak of other men of such a shameful
 confession; wherefore it were great pity and great shame
 unto me that I should let thee live any longer; therefore
 keep thee as well as ever thou mayest, for as I am true
 knight, either thou shalt slay me or else I shall slay thee,
 I promise thee faithfully.
 
 Then they lashed together fiercely, and at the last
 Alisander smote Malgrin to the earth.  And then he raced
 off his helm, and smote off his head lightly.  And when
 he had done and ended this battle, anon he called to him
 his varlet, the which brought him his horse.  And then
 he, weening to be strong enough, would have mounted.
 And so she laid Sir Alisander in an horse litter, and led
 him into the castle, for he had no foot nor might to stand
 upon the earth; for he had sixteen great wounds, and in
 especial one of them was like to be his death.
