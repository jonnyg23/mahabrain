 CHAPTER VIII
 
 How Sir Launcelot was delivered out of prison by a lady,
 and took a white courser and came for to keep his day
 
 
 SO leave we Sir Launcelot lying within that cave in great
 pain; and every day there came a lady and brought him
 his meat and his drink, and wooed him, to have lain by
 him; and ever the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, said her
 nay.  Sir Launcelot, said she, ye are not wise, for ye may
 never out of this prison, but if ye have my help; and
 also your lady, Queen Guenever, shall be brent in your
 default, unless that ye be there at the day of battle.  God
 defend, said Sir Launcelot, that she should be brent in my
 default; and if it be so, said Sir Launcelot, that I may not
 be there, it shall be well understanded, both at the king and
 at the queen, and with all men of worship, that I am dead,
 sick, outher in prison.  For all men that know me will
 say for me that I am in some evil case an I be not there
 that day; and well I wot there is some good knight either
 of my blood, or some other that loveth me, that will take
 my quarrel in hand; and therefore, said Sir Launcelot, wit
 ye well ye shall not fear me; and if there were no more
 women in all this land but ye, I will not have ado with
 you.  Then art thou shamed, said the lady, and destroyed
 for ever.  As for world's shame, Jesu defend me, and as
 for my distress, it is welcome whatsoever it be that God
 sendeth me.
 
 So she came to him the same day that the battle should
 be, and said:  Sir Launcelot, methinketh ye are too
 hard-hearted, but wouldest thou but kiss me once I should
 deliver thee, and thine armour, and the best horse that is
 within Sir Meliagrance's stable.  As for to kiss you, said
 Sir Launcelot, I may do that and lose no worship; and
 wit ye well an I understood there were any disworship
 for to kiss you I would not do it.  Then he kissed her,
 and then she gat him, and brought him to his armour.
 And when he was armed, she brought him to a stable,
 where stood twelve good coursers, and bade him choose
 the best.  Then Sir Launcelot looked upon a white
 courser the which liked him best; and anon he commanded
 the keepers fast to saddle him with the best saddle
 of war that there was; and so it was done as he bade.
 Then gat he his spear in his hand, and his sword by his
 side, and commended the lady unto God, and said: Lady,
 for this good deed I shall do you service if ever it be in
 my power.
