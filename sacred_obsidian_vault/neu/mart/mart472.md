 CHAPTER V
 
 How Sir Launcelot came to Sir Bors, and told him how he
 had sped, and in what adventure he had been, and how
 he had escaped
 
 
 WHEN Sir Bors saw Sir Launcelot he was never so glad of
 his home-coming as he was then.  Jesu mercy, said Sir
 Launcelot, why be ye all armed: what meaneth this?
 Sir, said Sir Bors, after ye were departed from us, we all
 that be of your blood and your well-willers were so
 dretched that some of us leapt out of our beds naked,
 and some in their dreams caught naked swords in their
 hands; therefore, said Sir Bors, we deem there is some
 great strife at hand; and then we all deemed that ye were
 betrapped with some treason, and therefore we made us
 thus ready, what need that ever ye were in.
 
 My fair nephew, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Bors,
 now shall ye wit all, that this night I was more harder
 bestead than ever I was in my life, and yet I escaped.
 And so he told them all how and in what manner, as ye
 have heard to-fore.  And therefore, my fellows, said Sir
 Launcelot, I pray you all that ye will be of good heart in
 what need somever I stand, for now is war come to us all.
 Sir, said Bors, all is welcome that God sendeth us, and we
 have had much weal with you and much worship, and
 therefore we will take the woe with you as we have taken
 the weal.  And therefore, they said all (there were many
 good knights), look ye take no discomfort, for there nis
 no bands of knights under heaven but we shall be able to
 grieve them as much as they may us.  And therefore discomfort
 not yourself by no manner, and we shall gather
 together that we love, and that loveth us, and what that
 ye will have done shall be done.  And therefore, Sir
 Launcelot, said they, we will take the woe with the weal.
 Grant mercy, said Sir Launcelot, of your good comfort,
 for in my great distress, my fair nephew, ye comfort me
 greatly, and much I am beholding unto you.  But this,
 my fair nephew, I would that ye did in all haste that ye
 may, or it be forth days, that ye will look in their lodging
 that be lodged here nigh about the king, which will hold
 with me, and which will not, for now I would know which
 were my friends from my foes.  Sir, said Sir Bors, I shall
 do my pain, and or it be seven of the clock I shall wit of
 such as ye have said before, who will hold with you.
 
 Then Sir Bors called unto him Sir Lionel, Sir Ector de
 Maris, Sir Blamore de Ganis, Sir Bleoberis de Ganis, Sir
 Gahalantine, Sir Galihodin, Sir Galihud, Sir Menadeuke
 Sir Villiers the Valiant, Sir Hebes le Renoumes, Sir Lavaine
 Sir Urre of Hungary, Sir Nerounes, Sir Plenorius.  These
 two knights Sir Launcelot made, and the one he won upon
 a bridge, and therefore they would never be against him.
 And Harry le Fise du Lake, and Sir Selises of the Dolorous Tower,
 and Sir Melias de Lile, and Sir Bellangere le
 Beuse, that was Sir Alisander's son Le Orphelin, because
 his mother Alice le Beale Pellerin and she was kin unto
 Sir Launcelot, and he held with him.  So there came Sir
 Palomides and Sir Safere, his brother, to hold with Sir
 Launcelot, and Sir Clegis of Sadok, and Sir Dinas,
 Sir Clarius of Cleremont.  So these two-and-twenty
 knights drew them together, and by then they were
 armed on horseback, and promised Sir Launcelot to do
 what he would.  Then there fell to them, what of North
 Wales and of Cornwall, for Sir Lamorak's sake and
 for Sir Tristram's sake, to the number of a fourscore
 knights.
 
 My lords, said Sir Launcelot, wit you well, I have been
 ever since I came into this country well willed unto my
 lord, King Arthur, and unto my lady, Queen Guenever,
 unto my power; and this night because my lady the queen
 sent for me to speak with her, I suppose it was made by
 treason, howbeit I dare largely excuse her person,
 notwithstanding I was there by a forecast near slain, but as Jesu
 provided me I escaped all their malice and treason.  And
 then that noble knight Sir Launcelot told them all how he
 was hard bestead in the queen's chamber, and how and in
 what manner he escaped from them.  And therefore, said
 Sir Launcelot, wit you well, my fair lords, I am sure there
 nis but war unto me and mine.  And for because I have
 slain this night these knights, I wot well, as is Sir Agravaine
 Sir Gawaine's brother, and at the least twelve of his fellows,
 for this cause now I am sure of mortal war, for these
 knights were sent and ordained by King Arthur to betray
 me.  And therefore the king will in his heat and malice
 judge the queen to the fire, and that may I not suffer, that
 she should be brent for my sake; for an I may be heard
 and suffered and so taken, I will fight for the queen, that
 she is a true lady unto her lord; but the king in his heat
 I dread me will not take me as I ought to be taken.
