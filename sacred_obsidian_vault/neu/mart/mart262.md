 CHAPTER XXV
 
 How Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred met with a knight
 fleeing, and how they both were overthrown, and of Sir
 Dinadan.
 
 
 NOW leave we of Sir Lamorak, and speak of Sir Gawaine's
 brethren, and specially of Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred.
 As they rode on their adventures they met with a knight
 fleeing, sore wounded; and they asked him what tidings.
 Fair knights, said he, here cometh a knight after me that
 will slay me.  With that came Sir Dinadan riding to them
 by adventure, but he would promise them no help.  But
 Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred promised him to rescue
 him.  Therewithal came that knight straight unto them,
 and anon he proffered to joust.  That saw Sir Mordred
 and rode to him, but he struck Mordred over his horse's
 tail.  That saw Sir Agravaine, and straight he rode toward
 that knight, and right so as he served Mordred so he
 served Agravaine, and said to them:  Sirs, wit ye well both
 that I am Breuse Saunce Pit<e>, that hath done this to you.
 And yet he rode over Agravaine five or six times.  When
 Dinadan saw this, he must needs joust with him for shame.
 And so Dinadan and he encountered together, that with
 pure strength Sir Dinadan smote him over his horse's tail
 Then he took his horse and fled, for he was on foot one
 of the valiantest knights in Arthur's days, and a great
 destroyer of all good knights.
 
 Then rode Sir Dinadan unto Sir Mordred and unto Sir
 Agravaine.  Sir knight, said they all, well have ye done,
 and well have ye revenged us, wherefore we pray you tell
 us your name.  Fair sirs, ye ought to know my name, the
 which is called Sir Dinadan.  When they understood that it
 was Dinadan they were more wroth than they were before,
 for they hated him out of measure because of Sir Lamorak.
 For Dinadan had such a custom that he loved all good
 knights that were valiant, and he hated all those that were
 destroyers of good knights.  And there were none that
 hated Dinadan but those that ever were called murderers.
 Then spake the hurt knight that Breuse Saunce Pit<e> had
 chased, his name was Dalan, and said:  If thou be Dinadan
 thou slewest my father.  It may well be so, said Dinadan,
 but then it was in my defence and at his request.  By my
 head, said Dalan, thou shalt die therefore, and therewith
 he dressed his spear and his shield.  And to make the
 shorter tale, Sir Dinadan smote him down off his horse,
 that his neck was nigh broken.  And in the same wise he
 smote Sir Mordred and Sir Agravaine.  And after, in the
 quest of the Sangreal, cowardly and feloniously they slew
 Dinadan, the which was great damage, for he was a great
 bourder and a passing good knight.
 
 And so Sir Dinadan rode to a castle that hight Beale-
 Valet.  And there he found Sir Palomides that was not
 yet whole of the wound that Sir Lamorak gave him.  And
 there Dinadan told Palomides all the tidings that he heard
 and saw of Sir Tristram, and how he was gone with King
 Mark, and with him he hath all his will and desire.
 Therewith Sir Palomides waxed wroth, for he loved La
 Beale Isoud.  And then he wist well that Sir Tristram
 enjoyed her.
