 CHAPTER XXIV
 
 How Sir Lamorak visited King Lot's wife, and how Sir
 Gaheris slew her which was his own mother.
 
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Lamorak, that much was there praised.
 Then, by the mean of Sir Gawaine and his brethren, they
 sent for their mother there besides, fast by a castle beside
 Camelot; and all was to that intent to slay Sir Lamorak.
 The Queen of Orkney was there but a while, but Sir
 Lamorak wist of their being, and was full fain; and for to
 make an end of this matter, he sent unto her, and there
 betwixt them was a night assigned that Sir Lamorak should
 come to her.  Thereof was ware Sir Gaheris, and there he
 rode afore the same night, and waited upon Sir Lamorak,
 and then he saw where he came all armed.  And where
 Sir Lamorak alighted he tied his horse to a privy postern,
 and so he went into a parlour and unarmed him; and
 then he went unto the queen's bed, and she made of him
 passing great joy, and he of her again, for either loved
 other passing sore.  So when the knight, Sir Gaheris, saw
 his time, he came to their bedside all armed, with his sword
 naked, and suddenly gat his mother by the hair and struck
 off her head.
 
 When Sir Lamorak saw the blood dash upon him all
 hot, the which he loved passing well, wit you well he was
 sore abashed and dismayed of that dolorous knight.  And
 therewithal, Sir Lamorak leapt out of the bed in his shirt
 as a knight dismayed, saying thus:  Ah, Sir Gaheris, knight
 of the Table Round, foul and evil have ye done, and to you
 great shame.  Alas, why have ye slain your mother that
 bare you? with more right ye should have slain me.  The
 offence hast thou done, said Gaheris, notwithstanding a
 man is born to offer his service; but yet shouldst thou
 beware with whom thou meddlest, for thou hast put me
 and my brethren to a shame, and thy father slew our
 father; and thou to lie by our mother is too much shame
 for us to suffer.  And as for thy father, King Pellinore
 my brother Sir Gawaine and I slew him.  Ye did him
 the more wrong, said Sir Lamorak, for my father slew
 not your father, it was Balin le Savage: and as yet my
 father's death is not revenged.  Leave those words, said Sir
 Gaheris, for an thou speak feloniously I will slay thee.  But
 because thou art naked I am ashamed to slay thee.  But
 wit thou well, in what place I may get thee I shall slay
 thee; and now my mother is quit of thee; and withdraw
 thee and take thine armour, that thou were gone.  Sir
 Lamorak saw there was none other bote, but fast armed
 him, and took his horse and rode his way making great
 sorrow.  But for the shame and dolour he would not ride
 to King Arthur's court, but rode another way.
 
 But when it was known that Gaheris had slain his
 mother the king was passing wroth, and commanded him
 to go out of his court.  Wit ye well Sir Gawaine was
 wroth that Gaheris had slain his mother and let Sir Lamorak
 escape.  And for this matter was the king passing wroth,
 and so was Sir Launcelot, and many other knights.  Sir, said
 Sir Launcelot, here is a great mischief befallen by felony,
 and by forecast treason, that your sister is thus shamefully
 slain.  And I dare say that it was wrought by treason,
 and I dare say ye shall lose that good knight, Sir Lamorak
 the which is great pity.  I wot well and am sure, an Sir
 Tristram wist it, he would never more come within your
 court, the which should grieve you much more and all your
 knights.  God defend, said the noble King Arthur, that I
 should lose Sir Lamorak or Sir Tristram, for then twain
 of my chief knights of the Table Round were gone.  Sir,
 said Sir Launcelot, I am sure ye shall lose Sir Lamorak, for
 Sir Gawaine and his brethren will slay him by one mean or
 other; for they among them have concluded and sworn to
 slay him an ever they may see their time.  That shall I
 let, said Arthur.
