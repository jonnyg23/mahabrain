 CHAPTER XXIV
 
 How King Arthur marvelled much of the jousting in the field,
 and how he rode and found Sir Launcelot.
 
 
 SO this tournament and this jousts dured long, till it was
 near night, for the knights of the Round Table relieved
 ever unto King Arthur; for the king was wroth out of
 measure that he and his knights might not prevail that
 day.  Then Sir Gawaine said to the king:  I marvel where
 all this day [be] Sir Bors de Ganis and his fellowship of Sir
 Launcelot's blood, I marvel all this day they be not about
 you: it is for some cause said Sir Gawaine.  By my head,
 said Sir Kay, Sir Bors is yonder all this day upon the right
 hand of this field, and there he and his blood do more
 worshipfully than we do.  It may well be, said Sir Gawaine,
 but I dread me ever of guile; for on pain of my life, said
 Sir Gawaine, this knight with the red sleeve of gold is
 himself Sir Launcelot, I see well by his riding and by his
 great strokes; and the other knight in the same colours
 is the good young knight, Sir Lavaine.  Also that knight
 with the green shield is my brother, Sir Gareth, and yet
 he hath disguised himself, for no man shall never make
 him be against Sir Launcelot, because he made him
 knight.  By my head, said Arthur, nephew, I believe
 you; therefore tell me now what is your best counsel.
 Sir, said Sir Gawaine, ye shall have my counsel: let blow
 unto lodging, for an he be Sir Launcelot du Lake, and
 my brother, Sir Gareth, with him, with the help of that
 good young knight, Sir Lavaine, trust me truly it will be
 no boot to strive with them but if we should fall ten or
 twelve upon one knight, and that were no worship, but
 shame.  Ye say truth, said the king; and for to say
 sooth, said the king, it were shame to us so many as we
 be to set upon them any more; for wit ye well, said King
 Arthur, they be three good knights, and namely that
 knight with the sleeve of gold.
 
 So then they blew unto lodging; but forthwithal King
 Arthur let send unto the four kings, and to the mighty
 duke, and prayed them that the knight with the sleeve of
 gold depart not from them, but that the king may speak
 with him.  Then forthwithal King Arthur alighted and
 unarmed him, and took a little hackney and rode after
 Sir Launcelot, for ever he had a spy upon him.  And so
 he found him among the four kings and the duke; and
 there the king prayed them all unto supper, and they
 said they would with good will.  And when they were
 unarmed then King Arthur knew Sir Launcelot, Sir
 Lavaine, and Sir Gareth.  Ah, Sir Launcelot, said King
 Arthur, this day ye have heated me and my knights.
 
 So they yede unto Arthur's lodging all together, and
 there was a great feast and great revel, and the prize was
 given unto Sir Launcelot; and by heralds they named
 him that he had smitten down fifty knights, and Sir
 Gareth five-and-thirty, and Sir Lavaine four-and-twenty
 knights.  Then Sir Launcelot told the king and the
 queen how the lady huntress shot him in the forest of
 Windsor, in the buttock, with an broad arrow, and how
 the wound thereof was that time six inches deep, and in
 like long.  Also Arthur blamed Sir Gareth because he
 left his fellowship and held with Sir Launcelot.  My lord,
 said Sir Gareth, he made me a knight, and when I saw
 him so hard bestead, methought it was my worship to
 help him, for I saw him do so much, and so many noble
 knights against him; and when I understood that he was
 Sir Launcelot du Lake, I shamed to see so many knights
 against him alone.  Truly, said King Arthur unto Sir
 Gareth, ye say well, and worshipfully have ye done and
 to yourself great worship; and all the days of my life,
 said King Arthur unto Sir Gareth, wit you well I shall
 love you, and trust you the more better.  For ever, said
 Arthur, it is a worshipful knight's deed to help another
 worshipful knight when he seeth him in a great danger;
 for ever a worshipful man will be loath to see a worshipful
 man shamed; and he that is of no worship, and fareth
 with cowardice, never shall he show gentleness, nor no
 manner of goodness where he seeth a man in any danger,
 for then ever will a coward show no mercy; and always a
 good man will do ever to another man as he would be
 done to himself.  So then there were great feasts unto
 kings and dukes, and revel, game, and play, and all
 manner of noblesse was used; and he that was courteous,
 true, and faithful, to his friend was that time cherished.
