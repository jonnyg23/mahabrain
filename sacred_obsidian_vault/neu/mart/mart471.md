 CHAPTER IV
 
 How Sir Launcelot slew Sir Colgrevance, and armed him in
 his harness, and after slew Sir Agravaine, and twelve
 of his fellows
 
 
 AND therewith Sir Launcelot wrapped his mantle about
 his arm well and surely; and by then they had gotten a
 great form out of the hall, and therewithal they rashed
 at the door.  Fair lords, said Sir Launcelot, leave your
 noise and your rashing, and I shall set open this door, and
 then may ye do with me what it liketh you.  Come off
 then, said they all, and do it, for it availeth thee not to
 strive against us all; and therefore let us into this
 chamber, and we shall save thy life until thou come to
 King Arthur.  Then Launcelot unbarred the door, and
 with his left hand he held it open a little, so that but one
 man might come in at once; and so there came striding a
 good knight, a much man and large, and his name was
 Colgrevance of Gore, and he with a sword struck at Sir
 Launcelot mightily; and he put aside the stroke, and
 gave him such a buffet upon the helmet, that he fell
 grovelling dead within the chamber door.  And then Sir
 Launcelot with great might drew that dead knight within
 the chamber door; and Sir Launcelot with help of the
 queen and her ladies was lightly armed in Sir Colgrevance's
 armour.
 
 And ever stood Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred
 crying:  Traitor-knight, come out of the queen's chamber.
 Leave your noise, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Agravaine,
 for wit you well, Sir Agravaine, ye shall not prison me
 this night; and therefore an ye do by my counsel, go ye
 all from this chamber door, and make not such crying and
 such manner of slander as ye do; for I promise you by
 my knighthood, an ye will depart and make no more
 noise, I shall as to-morn appear afore you all before the
 king, and then let it be seen which of you all, outher else
 ye all, that will accuse me of treason; and there I shall
 answer you as a knight should, that hither I came to the
 queen for no manner of mal engin, and that will I prove
 and make it good upon you with my hands.  Fie on thee,
 traitor, said Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, we will have
 thee maugre thy head, and slay thee if we list; for we let
 thee wit we have the choice of King Arthur to save thee
 or to slay thee.  Ah sirs, said Sir Launcelot, is there none
 other grace with you? then keep yourself.
 
 So then Sir Launcelot set all open the chamber door,
 and mightily and knightly he strode in amongst them;
 and anon at the first buffet he slew Sir Agravaine.  And
 twelve of his fellows after, within a little while after, he
 laid them cold to the earth, for there was none of the
 twelve that might stand Sir Launcelot one buffet.  Also
 Sir Launcelot wounded Sir Mordred, and he fled with all
 his might.  And then Sir Launcelot returned again unto
 the queen, and said:  Madam, now wit you well all our
 true love is brought to an end, for now will King Arthur
 ever be my foe; and therefore, madam, an it like you
 that I may have you with me, I shall save you from all
 manner adventures dangerous.  That is not best, said the
 queen; meseemeth now ye have done so much harm, it
 will be best ye hold you still with this.  And if ye see
 that as to-morn they will put me unto the death, then
 may ye rescue me as ye think best.  I will well, said Sir
 Launcelot, for have ye no doubt, while I am living I shall
 rescue you.  And then he kissed her, and either gave
 other a ring; and so there he left the queen, and went
 until his lodging.
