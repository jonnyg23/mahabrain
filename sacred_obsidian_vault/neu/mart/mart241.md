 CHAPTER IV
 
 How Sir Tristram smote down Sir Sagramore le Desirous
 and Sir Dodinas le Savage.
 
 
 AND then he sent his man that hight Gouvernail, and commanded
 him to go to a city thereby to fetch him new harness;
 for it was long time afore that that Sir Tristram had been
 refreshed, his harness was brised and broken.  And when
 Gouvernail, his servant, was come with his apparel, he took
 his leave at the widow, and mounted upon his horse, and
 rode his way early on the morn.  And by sudden adventure
 Sir Tristram met with Sir Sagramore le Desirous, and
 with Sir Dodinas le Savage.  And these two knights met
 with Sir Tristram and questioned with him, and asked
 him if he would joust with them.  Fair knights, said Sir
 Tristram, with a good will I would joust with you, but I
 have promised at a day set, near hand, to do battle with a
 strong knight; and therefore I am loath to have ado with
 you, for an it misfortuned me here to be hurt I should
 not be able to do my battle which I promised.  As for
 that, said Sagramore, maugre your head, ye shall joust
 with us or ye pass from us.  Well, said Sir Tristram, if
 ye enforce me thereto I must do what I may.  And then
 they dressed their shields, and came running together with
 great ire.  But through Sir Tristram's great force he
 struck Sir Sagramore from his horse.  Then he hurled his
 horse farther, and said to Sir Dodinas:  Knight, make thee
 ready; and so through fine force Sir Tristram struck
 Dodinas from his horse.  And when he saw them lie on
 the earth he took his bridle, and rode forth on his way,
 and his man Gouvernail with him.
 
 Anon as Sir Tristram was passed, Sir Sagramore and
 Sir Dodinas gat again their horses, and mounted up lightly
 and followed after Sir Tristram.  And when Sir Tristram
 saw them come so fast after him he returned with his horse
 to them, and asked them what they would.  It is not long
 ago sithen I smote you to the earth at your own request
 and desire:  I would have ridden by you, but ye would
 not suffer me, and now meseemeth ye would do more
 battle with me.  That is truth, said Sir Sagramore and Sir
 Dodinas, for we will be revenged of the despite ye have
 done to us.  Fair knights, said Sir Tristram, that shall
 little need you, for all that I did to you ye caused it;
 wherefore I require you of your knighthood leave me as
 at this time, for I am sure an I do battle with you I shall
 not escape without great hurts, and as I suppose ye shall
 not escape all lotless.  And this is the cause why I am so
 loath to have ado with you; for I must fight within these
 three days with a good knight, and as valiant as any is
 now living, and if I be hurt I shall not be able to do
 battle with him.  What knight is that, said Sir Sagramore,
 that ye shall fight withal?  Sirs, said he, it is a good
 knight called Sir Palomides.  By my head, said Sir
 Sagramore and Sir Dodinas, ye have cause to dread him,
 for ye shall find him a passing good knight, and a valiant.
 And because ye shall have ado with him we will forbear
 you as at this time, and else ye should not escape us
 lightly.  But, fair knight, said Sir Sagramore, tell us your
 name.  Sir, said he, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones.
 Ah, said Sagramore and Sir Dodinas, well be ye found,
 for much worship have we heard of you.  And then either
 took leave of other, and departed on their way.
