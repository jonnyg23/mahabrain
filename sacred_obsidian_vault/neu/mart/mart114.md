 CHAPTER XIV
 
 How Sir Launcelot followed a brachet into a castle, where he
 found a dead knight, and how he after was required of
 a damosel to heal her brother.
 
 NOW leave we there and speak of Sir Launcelot that rode a great
 while in a deep forest, where he saw a black brachet, seeking in
 manner as it had been in the feute of an hurt deer.  And
 therewith he rode after the brachet, and he saw lie on the ground
 a large feute of blood.  And then Sir Launcelot rode after.  And
 ever the brachet looked behind her, and so she went through a
 great marsh, and ever Sir Launcelot followed.  And then was he
 ware of an old manor, and thither ran the brachet, and so over
 the bridge.  So Sir Launcelot rode over that bridge that was old
 and feeble; and when he came in midst of a great hall, there he
 saw lie a dead knight that was a seemly man, and that brachet
 licked his wounds.  And therewithal came out a lady weeping and
 wringing her hands; and then she said, O knight, too much sorrow
 hast thou brought me.  Why say ye so? said Sir Launcelot, I did
 never this knight no harm, for hither by feute of blood &lt;200&gt;this
 brachet brought me; and therefore, fair lady, be not displeased
 with me, for I am full sore aggrieved of your grievance.  Truly,
 sir, she said, I trow it be not ye that hath slain my husband,
 for he that did that deed is sore wounded, and he is never likely
 to recover, that shall I ensure him.  What was your husband's
 name? said Sir Launcelot.  Sir, said she, his name was called Sir
 Gilbert the Bastard, one of the best knights of the world, and he
 that hath slain him I know not his name.  Now God send you better
 comfort, said Sir Launcelot; and so he departed and went into the
 forest again, and there he met with a damosel, the which knew him
 well, and she said aloud, Well be ye found, my lord; and now I
 require thee, on thy knighthood, help my brother that is sore
 wounded, and never stinteth bleeding; for this day he fought with
 Sir Gilbert the Bastard and slew him in plain battle, and there
 was my brother sore wounded, and there is a lady a sorceress that
 dwelleth in a castle here beside, and this day she told me my
 brother's wounds should never be whole till I could find a knight
 that would go into the Chapel Perilous, and there he should find
 a sword and a bloody cloth that the wounded knight was lapped in,
 and a piece of that cloth and sword should heal my brother's
 wounds, so that his wounds were searched with the sword and the
 cloth.  This is a marvellous thing, said Sir Launcelot, but what
 is your brother's name?  Sir, she said, his name was Sir Meliot
 de Logres.  That me repenteth, said Sir Launcelot, for he is a
 fellow of the Table Round, and to his help I will do my power. 
 Then, sir, said she, follow even this highway, and it will bring
 you unto the Chapel Perilous; and here I shall abide till God
 send you here again, and, but you speed, I know no knight living
 that may achieve that adventure
