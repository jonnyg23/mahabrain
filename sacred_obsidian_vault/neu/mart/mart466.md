 CHAPTER XII
 
 How Sir Launcelot was commanded by Arthur to handle his
 wounds, and anon he was all whole, and how they
 thanked God
 
 
 MERCY Jesu, said King Arthur, where is Sir Launcelot du
 Lake that he is not here at this time?  Thus, as they
 stood and spake of many things, there was espied Sir
 Launcelot that came riding toward them, and told the
 king.  Peace, said the king, let no manner thing be said
 until he be come to us.  So when Sir Launcelot espied
 King Arthur, he descended from his horse and came to
 the king, and saluted him and them all.  Anon as the
 maid, Sir Urre's sister, saw Sir Launcelot, she ran to her
 brother thereas he lay in his litter, and said:  Brother,
 here is come a knight that my heart giveth greatly unto.
 Fair sister, said Sir Urre, so doth my heart light against
 him, and certainly I hope now to be healed, for my
 heart giveth unto him more than to all these that have
 searched me.
 
 Then said Arthur unto Sir Launcelot:  Ye must do as
 we have done; and told Sir Launcelot what they had
 done, and showed him them all, that had searched him.
 Jesu defend me, said Sir Launcelot, when so many kings
 and knights have assayed and failed, that I should presume
 upon me to enchieve that all ye, my lords, might not
 enchieve.  Ye shall not choose, said King Arthur, for I
 will command you for to do as we all have done.  My
 most renowned lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye know well
 I dare not nor may not disobey your commandment, but
 an I might or durst, wit you well I would not take upon
 me to touch that wounded knight in that intent that I
 should pass all other knights; Jesu defend me from that
 shame.  Ye take it wrong, said King Arthur, ye shall not
 do it for no presumption, but for to bear us fellowship,
 insomuch ye be a fellow of the Table Round; and wit you
 well, said King Arthur, an ye prevail not and heal him,
 I dare say there is no knight in this land may heal him,
 and therefore I pray you, do as we have done.
 
 And then all the kings and knights for the most part
 prayed Sir Launcelot to search him; and then the
 wounded knight, Sir Urre, set him up weakly, and prayed
 Sir Launcelot heartily, saying:  Courteous knight, I
 require thee for God's sake heal my wounds, for methinketh
 ever sithen ye came here my wounds grieve me
 not.  Ah, my fair lord, said Sir Launcelot, Jesu would
 that I might help you; I shame me sore that I should be
 thus rebuked, for never was I able in worthiness to do so
 high a thing.  Then Sir Launcelot kneeled down by the
 wounded knight saying:  My lord Arthur, I must do
 your commandment, the which is sore against my heart.
 And then he held up his hands, and looked into the east,
 saying secretly unto himself:  Thou blessed Father, Son,
 and Holy Ghost, I beseech thee of thy mercy, that my
 simple worship and honesty be saved, and thou blessed
 Trinity, thou mayst give power to heal this sick knight
 by thy great virtue and grace of thee, but, Good Lord,
 never of myself.  And then Sir Launcelot prayed Sir
 Urre to let him see his head; and then devoutly kneeling
 he ransacked the three wounds, that they bled a little, and
 forthwith all the wounds fair healed, and seemed as they
 had been whole a seven year.  And in likewise he searched
 his body of other three wounds, and they healed in
 likewise; and then the last of all he searched the which was
 in his hand, and anon it healed fair.
 
 Then King Arthur and all the kings and knights
 kneeled down and gave thankings and lovings unto God
 and to His Blessed Mother.  And ever Sir Launcelot
 wept as he had been a child that had been beaten.  Then
 King Arthur let array priests and clerks in the most
 devoutest manner, to bring in Sir Urre within Carlisle,
 with singing and loving to God.  And when this was
 done, the king let clothe him in the richest manner that
 could be thought; and then were there but few better
 made knights in all the court, for he was passingly well
 made and bigly; and Arthur asked Sir Urre how he felt
 himself.  My good lord, he said, I felt myself never so
 lusty.  Will ye joust and do deeds of arms? said King
 Arthur.  Sir, said Urre, an I had all that longed unto
 jousts I would be soon ready.
