 CHAPTER I
 
 How Sir Percivale came to a recluse and asked counsel, and
 how she told him that she was his aunt.
 
 
 NOW saith the tale, that when Sir Launcelot was ridden
 after Sir Galahad, the which had all these adventures
 above said, Sir Percivale turned again unto the recluse,
 where he deemed to have tidings of that knight that
 Launcelot followed.  And so he kneeled at her window,
 and the recluse opened it and asked Sir Percivale what he
 would.  Madam, he said, I am a knight of King Arthur's
 court, and my name is Sir Percivale de Galis.  When the
 recluse heard his name she had great joy of him, for
 mickle she had loved him to-fore any other knight, for she
 ought to do so, for she was his aunt.  And then she
 commanded the gates to be opened, and there he had all
 the cheer that she might make him, and all that was in
 her power was at his commandment.
 
 So on the morn Sir Percivale went to the recluse and
 asked her if she knew that knight with the white shield.
 Sir, said she, why would ye wit?  Truly, madam, said Sir
 Percivale, I shall never be well at ease till that I know of
 that knight's fellowship, and that I may fight with him,
 for I may not leave him so lightly, for I have the shame
 yet.  Ah, Percivale, said she, would ye fight with him?
 I see well ye have great will to be slain as your father
 was, through outrageousness.  Madam, said Sir Percivale,
 it seemeth by your words that ye know me.  Yea, said
 she, I well ought to know you, for I am your aunt,
 although I be in a priory place.  For some called me
 sometime the Queen of the Waste Lands, and I was called
 the queen of most riches in the world; and it pleased
 me never my riches so much as doth my poverty.  Then
 Sir Percivale wept for very pity when that he knew it
 was his aunt.  Ah, fair nephew, said she, when heard ye
 tidings of your mother?  Truly, said he, I heard none of
 her, but I dream of her much in my sleep; and therefore
 I wot not whether she be dead or alive.  Certes, fair
 nephew, said she, your mother is dead, for after your
 departing from her she took such a sorrow that anon,
 after she was confessed, she died.  Now, God have mercy
 on her soul, said Sir Percivale, it sore forthinketh me;
 but all we must change the life.  Now, fair aunt, tell me
 what is the knight?  I deem it be he that bare the red
 arms on Whitsunday.  Wit you well, said she, that this
 is he, for otherwise ought he not to do, but to go in red
 arms; and that same knight hath no peer, for he worketh
 all by miracle, and he shall never be overcome of none
 earthly man's hand.
