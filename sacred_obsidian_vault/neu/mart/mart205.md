 CHAPTER XI
 
 How Sir Tristram met with Sir Lamorak de Galis, and how
 they fought, and after accorded never to fight together.
 
 NOW fair knight, he said, my name is Sir Tristram de Liones. 
 Sir, said the other knight, and my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis. 
 Ah, Sir Lamorak, said Sir Tristram, well be we met, and bethink
 thee now of the despite thou didst me of the sending of the horn
 unto King Mark's court, to the intent to have slain or
 dishonoured my lady the queen, La Beale Isoud; and therefore wit
 thou well, said Sir Tristram, the one of us shall die or we
 depart.  Sir, said Sir Lamorak, remember that we were together in
 the Isle of Servage, and at that time ye promised me great
 friendship.  Then Sir Tristram would make no longer delays, but
 lashed at Sir Lamorak; and thus they fought long till either were
 weary of other.  Then Sir Tristram said to Sir Lamorak:  In all
 my life met I never with such a knight that was so big and well
 breathed as ye be, therefore, said Sir Tristram, it were pity
 that any of us both should here be mischieved.  Sir &lt;370&gt;said Sir
 Lamorak, for your renown and name I will that ye have the worship
 of this battle, and therefore I will yield me unto you.  And
 therewith he took the point of his sword to yield him.  Nay, said
 Sir Tristram, ye shall not do so, for well I know your proffers,
 and more of your gentleness than for any fear or dread ye have of
 me.  And therewithal Sir Tristram proffered him his sword and
 said:  Sir Lamorak, as an overcome knight I yield me unto you as
 to a man of the most noble prowess that ever I met withal.  Nay,
 said Sir Lamorak, I will do you gentleness; I require you let us
 be sworn together that never none of us shall after this day have
 ado with other.  And therewithal Sir Tristram and Sir Lamorak
 sware that never none of them should fight against other, nor for
 weal nor for woe.
