 CHAPTER V
 
 How Sir Launcelot jousted with many knights, and
 how he was taken.
 
 
 AND then mounted upon his horse, and rode into a forest,
 and held no highway.  And as he looked afore him he
 saw a fair plain, and beside that a fair castle, and afore the
 castle were many pavilions of silk and of diverse hue.
 And him seemed that he saw there five hundred knights
 riding on horseback; and there were two parties: they
 that were of the castle were all on black horses and their
 trappings black, and they that were without were all on
 white horses and trappings, and everych hurtled to other
 that it marvelled Sir Launcelot.  And at the last him
 thought they of the castle were put to the worse.
 
 Then thought Sir Launcelot for to help there the
 weaker party in increasing of his chivalry.  And so Sir
 Launcelot thrust in among the party of the castle, and
 smote down a knight, horse and man, to the earth.  And
 then he rashed here and there, and did marvellous deeds
 of arms.  And then he drew out his sword, and struck
 many knights to the earth, so that all those that saw him
 marvelled that ever one knight might do so great deeds
 of arms.  But always the white knights held them nigh
 about Sir Launcelot, for to tire him and wind him.  But
 at the last, as a man may not ever endure, Sir Launcelot
 waxed so faint of fighting and travailing, and was so weary
 of his great deeds, that[1] he might not lift up his arms for
 to give one stroke, so that he weened never to have borne
 arms; and then they all took and led him away into a
 forest, and there made him to alight and to rest him.
 And then all the fellowship of the castle were overcome
 for the default of him.  Then they said all unto Sir
 Launcelot:  Blessed be God that ye be now of our fellowship,
 for we shall hold you in our prison; and so they left

 him with few words.  And then Sir Launcelot made great
 sorrow, For never or now was I never at tournament nor
 jousts but I had the best, and now I am shamed; and
 then he said:  Now I am sure that I am more sinfuller
 than ever I was.
 
 Thus he rode sorrowing, and half a day he was out of
 despair, till that he came into a deep valley.  And when
 Sir Launcelot saw he might not ride up into the mountain,
 he there alighted under an apple tree, and there he left
 his helm and his shield, and put his horse unto pasture.
 And then he laid him down to sleep.  And then him
 thought there came an old man afore him, the which said:
 Ah, Launcelot of evil faith and poor belief, wherefore is
 thy will turned so lightly toward thy deadly sin?  And
 when he had said thus he vanished away, and Launcelot
 wist not where he was become.  Then he took his horse,
 and armed him; and as he rode by the way he saw a
 chapel where was a recluse, which had a window that she
 might see up to the altar.  And all aloud she called
 Launcelot, for that he seemed a knight errant.  And then
 he came, and she asked him what he was, and of what
 place, and where about he went to seek.
