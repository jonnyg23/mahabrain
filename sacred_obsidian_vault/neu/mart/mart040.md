 CHAPTER XIV
 
 How Balin met with that knight named Garlon at a feast,
 and there he slew him, to have his blood to heal therewith
 the son of his host.
 
 THEN they rode three or four days and never met with adventure,
 and by hap they were lodged with a gentle man that was a rich man
 and well at ease.  And as they sat at their supper Balin
 overheard one complain grievously by him in a chair.  What is
 this noise? said Balin.  Forsooth, said his host, I will tell
 you.  I was but late at a jousting, and there I jousted with a
 knight that is brother unto King Pellam, and twice smote I him
 down, and then he promised to quit me on my best friend; and so
 he wounded my son, that cannot be whole till I have of that
 knight's blood, and he rideth alway invisible; but I know not his
 name.  Ah! said Balin, I know that knight, his name is Garlon, he
 hath slain two knights of mine in the same manner, therefore I
 had liefer meet with that knight &lt;69&gt;than all the gold in this
 realm, for the despite he hath done me.  Well, said his host, I
 shall tell you, King Pellam of Listeneise hath made do cry in all
 this country a great feast that shall be within these twenty
 days, and no knight may come there but if he bring his wife with
 him, or his paramour; and that knight, your enemy and mine, ye
 shall see that day.  Then I behote you, said Balin, part of his
 blood to heal your son withal.  We will be forward to-morn, said
 his host.  So on the morn they rode all three toward Pellam, and
 they had fifteen days' journey or they came thither; and that
 same day began the great feast.  And so they alighted and stabled
 their horses, and went into the castle; but Balin's host might
 not be let in because he had no lady.  Then Balin was well
 received and brought unto a chamber and unarmed him; and there
 were brought him robes to his pleasure, and would have had Balin
 leave his sword behind him.  Nay, said Balin, that do I not, for
 it is the custom of my country a knight always to keep his weapon
 with him, and that custom will I keep, or else I will depart as I
 came.  Then they gave him leave to wear his sword, and so he went
 unto the castle, and was set among knights of worship, and his
 lady afore him.
 
 Soon Balin asked a knight, Is there not a knight in this court
 whose name is Garlon?  Yonder he goeth, said a knight, he with
 the black face; he is the marvellest knight that is now living,
 for he destroyeth many good knights, for he goeth invisible.  Ah
 well, said Balin, is that he?  Then Balin advised him long:  If I
 slay him here I shall not escape, and if I leave him now,
 peradventure I shall never meet with him again at such a steven,
 and much harm he will do an he live.  Therewith this Garlon
 espied that this Balin beheld him, and then he came and smote
 Balin on the face with the back of his hand, and said, Knight,
 why beholdest me so? for shame therefore, eat thy meat and do
 that thou came for.  Thou sayest sooth, said Balin, this is not
 the first despite that thou hast done me, and therefore I will do
 what I came for, and rose up fiercely and clave his head to the
 shoulders.  &lt;70&gt;Give me the truncheon, said Balin to his lady,
 wherewith he slew your knight.  Anon she gave it him, for alway
 she bare the truncheon with her.  And therewith Balin smote him
 through the body, and said openly, With that truncheon thou hast
 slain a good knight, and now it sticketh in thy body.  And then
 Balin called unto him his host, saying, Now may ye fetch blood
 enough to heal your son withal.
