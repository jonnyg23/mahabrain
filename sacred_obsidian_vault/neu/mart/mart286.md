 CHAPTER XLIX
 
 Of the seventh battle, and how Sir Launcelot, being disguised
 like a maid, smote down Sir Dinadan.
 
 
 NOW beginneth the seventh battle.  There came in the
 Duke Cambines, and there encountered with him Sir
 Aristance, that was counted a good knight, and they met
 so hard that either bare other down, horse and man.  Then
 came there the Earl of Lambaile and helped the duke again
 to horse.  Then came there Sir Ossaise of Surluse, and he
 smote the Earl Lambaile down from his horse.  Then
 began they to do great deeds of arms, and many spears
 were broken, and many knights were cast to the earth.
 Then the King of Northgalis and the Earl Ulbawes
 smote together that all the judges thought it was like
 mortal death.  This meanwhile Queen Guenever, and the
 haut prince, and Sir Launcelot, made there Sir Dinadan
 make him ready to joust.  I would, said Dinadan, ride
 into the field, but then one of you twain will meet with me.
 Per dieu, said the haut prince, ye may see how we sit here
 as judges with our shields, and always mayest thou behold
 whether we sit here or not.
 
 So Sir Dinadan departed and took his horse, and met
 with many knights, and did passing well.  And as he was
 departed, Sir Launcelot disguised himself, and put upon
 his armour a maiden's garment freshly attired.  Then Sir
 Launcelot made Sir Galihodin to lead him through the
 range, and all men had wonder what damosel it was.  And
 so as Sir Dinadan came into the range, Sir Launcelot, that
 was in the damosel's array, gat Galihodin's spear, and ran
 unto Sir Dinadan.  And always Sir Dinadan looked up
 thereas Sir Launcelot was, and then he saw one sit in the
 stead of Sir Launcelot, armed.  But when Dinadan saw a
 manner of a damosel he dread perils that it was Sir Launcelot
 disguised, but Sir Launcelot came on him so fast that
 he smote him over his horse's croup; and then with great
 scorns they gat Sir Dinadan into the forest there beside,
 and there they dispoiled him unto his shirt, and put upon
 him a woman's garment, and so brought him into the
 field: and so they blew unto lodging.  And every knight
 went and unarmed them.  Then was Sir Dinadan brought
 in among them all.  And when Queen Guenever saw Sir
 Dinadan brought so among them all, then she laughed
 that she fell down, and so did all that there were.  Well,
 said Dinadan to Launcelot, thou art so false that I can
 never beware of thee.  Then by all the assent they gave
 Sir Launcelot the prize, the next was Sir Lamorak de Galis,
 the third was Sir Palomides, the fourth was King Bagdemagus;
 so these four knights had the prize, and there was
 great joy, and great nobley in all the court.
 
 And on the morn Queen Guenever and Sir Launcelot
 departed unto King Arthur, but in no wise Sir Lamorak
 would not go with them.  I shall undertake, said Sir
 Launcelot, that an ye will go with us King Arthur shall
 charge Sir Gawaine and his brethren never to do you hurt.
 As for that, said Sir Lamorak, I will not trust Sir Gawaine
 nor none of his brethren; and wit ye well, Sir Launcelot,
 an it were not for my lord King Arthur's sake, I should
 match Sir Gawaine and his brethren well enough.  But to
 say that I should trust them, that shall I never, and
 therefore I pray you recommend me unto my lord Arthur, and
 unto all my lords of the Round Table.  And in what place
 that ever I come I shall do you service to my power: and
 sir, it is but late that I revenged that, when my lord
 Arthur's kin were put to the worse by Sir Palomides.
 Then Sir Lamorak departed from Sir Launcelot, and either
 wept at their departing.
