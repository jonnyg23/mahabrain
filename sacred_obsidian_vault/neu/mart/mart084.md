 CHAPTER XXIV
 
 How Sir Marhaus rode with the damosel, and how he
 came to the Duke of the South Marches.
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Marhaus, that rode with the damosel of
 thirty winter of age, southward.  And so they came into a deep
 forest, and by fortune they were nighted, and rode long in a deep
 way, and at the last they came unto a courtelage, and there they
 asked harbour.  But the man of the courtelage would not lodge
 them for no treatise that they could treat, but thus much the
 good man said, An ye will take the adventure of your lodging, I
 shall bring you where ye shall be lodged.  What adventure is that
 that I shall have for my lodging? said Sir Marhaus.  Ye shall wit
 when ye come there, said the good man.  Sir, what adventure so it
 be, bring me thither I pray thee, said Sir Marhaus; for I am
 weary, my damosel, and my horse.  So the good man went and opened
 the gate, and within an hour he brought him unto a fair castle,
 and then the poor man called the porter, and anon he was let into
 the castle, and so he told the lord how he brought him a knight
 errant and a damosel that would be lodged with him.  Let him in,
 said the lord, it may happen he shall repent that they took their
 lodging here.
 
 So Sir Marhaus was let in with torchlight, and there was a goodly
 sight of young men that welcomed him.  And then his horse was led
 into the stable, and he and the damosel were brought into the
 hall, and there stood a mighty duke and many goodly men about
 him.  Then this lord asked him what he hight, and from whence he
 came, and with whom he dwelt.  Sir, he said, I am a knight of
 King Arthur's and knight of the Table Round, and my name is Sir
 Marhaus, and born I am in Ireland.  And then said the duke to
 him, That me sore repenteth: the cause is this, for I love not
 thy lord nor none of thy &lt;142&gt;fellows of the Table Round; and
 therefore ease thyself this night as well as thou mayest, for as
 to-morn I and my six sons shall match with you.  Is there no
 remedy but that I must have ado with you and your six sons at
 once? said Sir Marhaus.  No, said the duke, for this cause I made
 mine avow, for Sir Gawaine slew my seven sons in a recounter,
 therefore I made mine avow, there should never knight of King
 Arthur's court lodge with me, or come thereas I might have ado
 with him, but that I would have a revenging of my sons' death. 
 What is your name? said Sir Marhaus; I require you tell me, an it
 please you.  Wit thou well I am the Duke of South Marches.  Ah,
 said Sir Marhaus, I have heard say that ye have been long time a
 great foe unto my lord Arthur and to his knights.  That shall ye
 feel to-morn, said the duke.  Shall I have ado with you? said Sir
 Marhaus.  Yea, said the duke, thereof shalt thou not choose, and
 therefore take you to your chamber, and ye shall have all that to
 you longeth.  So Sir Marhaus departed and was led to a chamber,
 and his damosel was led unto her chamber.  And on the morn the
 duke sent unto Sir Marhaus and bade make him ready.  And so Sir
 Marhaus arose and armed him, and then there was a mass sung afore
 him, and brake his fast, and so mounted on horseback in the court
 of the castle where they should do the battle.  So there was the
 duke all ready on horseback, clean armed, and his six sons by
 him, and everych had a spear in his hand, and so they
 encountered, whereas the duke and his two sons brake their spears
 upon him, but Sir Marhaus held up his spear and touched none of
 them.
