 CHAPTER XXXVII
 
 How Sir Suppinabiles told Sir Tristram how he was defamed
 in the court of King Arthur, and of Sir Lamorak.
 
 THEN departed Sir Suppinabiles unto Brittany again, and there he
 found Sir Tristram, and told him that he had been in King
 Arthur's court.  Then said Sir Tristram:  Heard ye anything of
 me?  So God me help, said Sir Suppinabiles, there I heard Sir
 Launcelot speak of you great shame, and that ye be a false knight
 to your lady and he bade me do you to wit that he will be your
 mortal enemy in every place where he may meet you.  That me
 repenteth, said Tristram, for of all knights I loved to be in his
 fellowship.  So Sir Tristram made great moan and was ashamed that
 noble knights should defame him for the sake of his lady.  And in
 this meanwhile La Beale &lt;341&gt;Isoud made a letter unto Queen
 Guenever, complaining her of the untruth of Sir Tristram, and how
 he had wedded the king's daughter of Brittany.  Queen Guenever
 sent her another letter, and bade her be of good cheer, for she
 should have joy after sorrow, for Sir Tristram was so noble a
 knight called, that by crafts of sorcery ladies would make such
 noble men to wed them.  But in the end, Queen Guenever said, it
 shall be thus, that he shall hate her, and love you better than
 ever he did to-fore.
 
 So leave we Sir Tristram in Brittany, and speak we of Sir Lamorak
 de Galis, that as he sailed his ship fell on a rock and perished
 all, save Sir Lamorak and his squire; and there he swam mightily,
 and fishers of the Isle of Servage took him up, and his squire
 was drowned, and the shipmen had great labour to save Sir
 Lamorak's life, for all the comfort that they could do.
 
 And the lord of that isle, hight Sir Nabon le Noire, a great
 mighty giant.  And this Sir Nabon hated all the knights of King
 Arthur's, and in no wise he would do them favour.  And these
 fishers told Sir Lamorak all the guise of Sir Nabon; how there
 came never knight of King Arthur's but he destroyed him.  And at
 the last battle that he did was slain Sir Nanowne le Petite, the
 which he put to a shameful death in despite of King Arthur, for
 he was drawn limb-meal.  That forthinketh me, said Sir Lamorak,
 for that knight's death, for he was my cousin; and if I were at
 mine ease as well as ever I was, I would revenge his death. 
 Peace, said the fishers, and make here no words, for or ever ye
 depart from hence Sir Nabon must know that ye have been here, or
 else we should die for your sake.  So that I be whole, said
 Lamorak, of my disease that I have taken in the sea, I will that
 ye tell him that I am a knight of King Arthur's, for I was never
 afeard to reneye my lord.
