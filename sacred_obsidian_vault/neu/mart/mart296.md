 CHAPTER LIX
 
 How they came to Humber bank, and how they found a ship
 there, wherein lay the body of King Hermance.
 
 
 SIR, said Palomides, let us leave of this matter, and let us
 see how we shall do at this tournament.  By mine advice,
 said Palomides, let us four hold together against all that
 will come.  Not by my counsel, said Sir Tristram, for I
 see by their pavilions there will be four hundred knights,
 and doubt ye not, said Sir Tristram, but there will be
 many good knights; and be a man never so valiant nor
 so big, yet he may be overmatched.  And so have I seen
 knights done many times; and when they weened best to
 have won worship they lost it, for manhood is not worth
 but if it be medled with wisdom.  And as for me, said
 Sir Tristram, it may happen I shall keep mine own head
 as well as another.
 
 So thus they rode until that they came to Humber
 bank, where they heard a cry and a doleful noise.  Then
 were they ware in the wind where came a rich vessel
 hilled over with red silk, and the vessel landed fast by
 them.  Therewith Sir Tristram alighted and his knights.
 And so Sir Tristram went afore and entered into that
 vessel.  And when he came within he saw a fair bed
 richly covered, and thereupon lay a dead seemly knight,
 all armed save the head, was all be-bled with deadly
 wounds upon him, the which seemed to be a passing good
 knight.  How may this be, said Sir Tristram, that this
 knight is thus slain?  Then Sir Tristram was ware of a
 letter in the dead knight's hand.  Master mariners, said
 Sir Tristram, what meaneth that letter?  Sir, said they,
 in that letter ye shall hear and know how he was slain,
 and for what cause, and what was his name.  But sir,
 said the mariners, wit ye well that no man shall take that
 letter and read it but if he be a good knight, and that
 he will faithfully promise to revenge his death, else shall
 there be no knight see that letter open.  Wit ye well,
 said Sir Tristram, that some of us may revenge his death
 as well as other, and if it be so as ye mariners say his
 death shall be revenged.  And therewith Sir Tristram
 took the letter out of the knight's hand, and it said thus:
 Hermance, king and lord of the Red City, I send unto
 all knights errant, recommending unto you noble knights
 of Arthur's court.  I beseech them all among them to
 find one knight that will fight for my sake with two
 brethren that I brought up of nought, and feloniously
 and traitorly they have slain me; wherefore I beseech
 one good knight to revenge my death.  And he that
 revengeth my death I will that he have my Red City and
 all my castles.
 
 Sir, said the mariners, wit ye well this king and knight
 that here lieth was a full worshipful man and of full
 great prowess, and full well he loved all manner knights
 errants.  So God me help, said Sir Tristram, here is a
 piteous case, and full fain would I take this enterprise
 upon me; but I have made such a promise that needs I
 must be at this great tournament, or else I am shamed.
 For well I wot for my sake in especial my lord Arthur let
 make this jousts and tournament in this country; and
 well I wot that many worshipful people will be there at
 that tournament for to see me; therefore I fear me to
 take this enterprise upon me that I shall not come again
 by time to this jousts.  Sir, said Palomides, I pray you
 give me this enterprise, and ye shall see me achieve it
 worshipfully, other else I shall die in this quarrel.  Well,
 said Sir Tristram, and this enterprise I give you, with
 this, that ye be with me at this tournament that shall be
 as this day seven night.  Sir, said Palomides, I promise
 you that I shall be with you by that day if I be unslain
 or unmaimed.
