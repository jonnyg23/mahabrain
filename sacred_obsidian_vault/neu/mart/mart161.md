 CHAPTER VIII
 
 How Sir Marhaus after that he was arrived in Ireland died
 of the stroke that Sir Tristram had given him, and how
 Tristram was hurt.
 
 ANON Sir Marhaus and his fellowship departed into Ireland.  And
 as soon as he came to the king, his brother, he let search his
 wounds.  And when his head was searched a piece of Sir Tristram's
 sword was found therein, and might never be had out of his head
 for no surgeons, and so he died of Sir Tristram's sword; and that
 piece of the sword the queen, his sister, kept it for ever with
 her, for she thought to be revenged an she might.
 
 Now turn we again unto Sir Tristram, that was sore wounded, and
 full sore bled that he might not within a little while, when he
 had taken cold, unnethe stir him of his limbs.  And then he set
 him down softly upon a little hill, and bled fast.  Then anon
 came Gouvernail, his man, with his vessel; and the king and his
 barons came with procession against him.  And when he was come
 unto the land, King Mark took him in his arms, and the king and
 Sir Dinas, the seneschal, led Sir Tristram into the castle of
 Tintagil.  And then was he searched in the best manner, and laid
 in his bed.  And when King Mark saw his wounds he wept heartily,
 and so did all his lords.  So God me help, said King Mark, I
 would not for all my lands that my nephew died.  So Sir Tristram
 lay there a month and more, and ever he was like to die of that
 stroke that Sir Marhaus smote him first with the spear.  For, as
 the &lt;291&gt;French book saith, the spear's head was envenomed, that
 Sir Tristram might not be whole.  Then was King Mark and all his
 barons passing heavy, for they deemed none other but that Sir
 Tristram should not recover.  Then the king let send after all
 manner of leeches and surgeons, both unto men and women, and
 there was none that would behote him the life.  Then came there a
 lady that was a right wise lady, and she said plainly unto King
 Mark, and to Sir Tristram, and to all his barons, that he should
 never be whole but if Sir Tristram went in the same country that
 the venom came from, and in that country should he be holpen or
 else never.  Thus said the lady unto the king.
 
 When King Mark understood that, he let purvey for Sir Tristram a
 fair vessel, well victualled, and therein was put Sir Tristram,
 and Gouvernail with him, and Sir Tristram took his harp with him,
 and so he was put into the sea to sail into Ireland; and so by
 good fortune he arrived up in Ireland, even fast by a castle
 where the king and the queen was; and at his arrival he sat and
 harped in his bed a merry lay, such one heard they never none in
 Ireland before that time.
 
 And when it was told the king and the queen of such a knight that
 was such an harper, anon the king sent for him, and let search
 his wounds, and then asked him his name.  Then he answered, I am
 of the country of Liones, and my name is Tramtrist, that thus was
 wounded in a battle as I fought for a lady's right.  So God me
 help, said King Anguish, ye shall have all the help in this land
 that ye may have here; but I let you wit, in Cornwall I had a
 great loss as ever had king, for there I lost the best knight of
 the world; his name was Marhaus, a full noble knight, and Knight
 of the Table Round; and there he told Sir Tristram wherefore Sir
 Marhaus was slain.  Sir Tristram made semblant as he had been
 sorry, and better knew he how it was than the king.
