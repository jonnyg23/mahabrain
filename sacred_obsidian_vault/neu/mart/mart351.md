 CHAPTER XII
 
 How Sir Tristram departed unarmed and met with Sir
 Palomides, and how they smote each other, and how Sir
 Palomides forbare him.
 
 
 AND so when the day came Sir Tristram took his leave at
 La Beale Isoud, and she sent with him four knights, and
 within half a mile he sent them again: and within a mile
 after Sir Tristram saw afore him where Sir Palomides had
 stricken down a knight, and almost wounded him to the
 death.  Then Sir Tristram repented him that he was not
 armed, and then he hoved still.  With that Sir Palomides
 knew Sir Tristram, and cried on high:  Sir Tristram, now
 be we met, for or we depart we will redress our old sores.
 As for that, said Sir Tristram, there was yet never
 Christian man might make his boast that ever I fled from
 him; and wit ye well, Sir Palomides, thou that art a
 Saracen shall never make thy boast that Sir Tristram de
 Liones shall flee from thee.  And therewith Sir Tristram
 made his horse to run, and with all his might he came
 straight upon Sir Palomides, and brast his spear upon him
 an hundred pieces.  And forthwithal Sir Tristram drew
 his sword.  And then he turned his horse and struck at
 Palomides six great strokes upon his helm; and then
 Sir Palomides stood still, and beheld Sir Tristram, and
 marvelled of his woodness, and of his folly.  And then
 Sir Palomides said to himself:  An Sir Tristram were
 armed, it were hard to cease him of this battle, and if I
 turn again and slay him I am ashamed wheresomever that
 I go.
 
 Then Sir Tristram spake and said:  Thou coward
 knight, what castest thou to do; why wilt thou not do
 battle with me? for have thou no doubt I shall endure all
 thy malice.  Ah, Sir Tristram, said Palomides, full well
 thou wottest I may not fight with thee for shame, for thou
 art here naked and I am armed, and if I slay thee,
 dishonour shall be mine.  And well thou wottest, said Sir
 Palomides to Sir Tristram, I know thy strength and thy
 hardiness to endure against a good knight.  That is truth,
 said Sir Tristram, I understand thy valiantness well.  Ye
 say well, said Sir Palomides; now, I require you, tell me
 a question that I shall say to you.  Tell me what it is, said
 Sir Tristram, and I shall answer you the truth, as God me
 help.  I put case, said Sir Palomides, that ye were armed
 at all rights as well as I am, and I naked as ye be, what
 would you do to me now, by your true knighthood?
 Ah, said Sir Tristram, now I understand thee well, Sir
 Palomides, for now must I say mine own judgment, and
 as God me bless, that I shall say shall not be said for no
 fear that I have of thee.  But this is all: wit Sir
 Palomides, as at this time thou shouldest depart from me, for
 I would not have ado with thee.  No more will I, said
 Palomides, and therefore ride forth on thy way.  As for
 that I may choose, said Sir Tristram, either to ride or to
 abide.  But Sir Palomides, said Sir Tristram, I marvel of
 one thing, that thou that art so good a knight, that thou
 wilt not be christened, and thy brother, Sir Safere, hath
 been christened many a day.
