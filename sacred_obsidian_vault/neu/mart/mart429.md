 CHAPTER XXIII
 
 Of the sorrow that Percivale and Bors made when Galahad
 was dead: and of Percivale how he died, and other
 matters.
 
 
 WHEN Percivale and Bors saw Galahad dead they made
 as much sorrow as ever did two men.  And if they had
 not been good men they might lightly have fallen in
 despair.  And the people of the country and of the city
 were right heavy.  And then he was buried; and as soon
 as he was buried Sir Percivale yielded him to an hermitage
 out of the city, and took a religious clothing.  And Bors
 was alway with him, but never changed he his secular
 clothing, for that he purposed him to go again into the
 realm of Logris.  Thus a year and two months lived Sir
 Percivale in the hermitage a full holy life, and then passed
 out of this world; and Bors let bury him by his sister and
 by Galahad in the spiritualities.
 
 When Bors saw that he was in so far countries as in the
 parts of Babylon he departed from Sarras, and armed him
 and came to the sea, and entered into a ship; and so it
 befell him in good adventure he came into the realm of
 Logris; and he rode so fast till he came to Camelot where
 the king was.  And then was there great joy made of him
 in the court, for they weened all he had been dead,
 forasmuch as he had been so long out of the country.  And
 when they had eaten, the king made great clerks to come
 afore him, that they should chronicle of the high adventures
 of the good knights.  When Bors had told him of
 the adventures of the Sangreal, such as had befallen him
 and his three fellows, that was Launcelot, Percivale,
 Galahad, and himself, there Launcelot told the adventures of
 the Sangreal that he had seen.  All this was made in great
 books, and put up in almeries at Salisbury.  And anon Sir
 Bors said to Sir Launcelot: Galahad, your own son,
 saluted you by me, and after you King Arthur and all the
 court, and so did Sir Percivale, for I buried them with
 mine own hands in the city of Sarras.  Also, Sir Launcelot,
 Galahad prayed you to remember of this unsiker world as
 ye behight him when ye were together more than half a
 year.  This is true, said Launcelot; now I trust to God
 his prayer shall avail me.
 
 Then Launcelot took Sir Bors in his arms, and said:
 Gentle cousin, ye are right welcome to me, and all that
 ever I may do for you and for yours ye shall find my poor
 body ready at all times, while the spirit is in it, and that I
 promise you faithfully, and never to fail.  And wit ye well,
 gentle cousin, Sir Bors, that ye and I will never depart
 asunder whilst our lives may last.  Sir, said he, I will as
 ye will.
