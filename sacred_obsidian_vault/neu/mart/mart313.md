 CHAPTER LXXVI
 
 How Sir Palomides changed his shield and his armour for to
 hurt Sir Tristram, and how Sir Launcelot did to Sir
 Tristram.
 
 
 THEN when Sir Palomides saw that Sir Tristram was
 disguised, then he thought to do him a shame.  So Sir
 Palomides rode to a knight that was sore wounded, that
 sat under a fair well from the field.  Sir knight, said
 Sir Palomides, I pray you to lend me your armour and
 your shield, for mine is over-well known in this field,
 and that hath done me great damage; and ye shall
 have mine armour and my shield that is as sure as yours.
 I will well, said the knight, that ye have mine armour
 and my shield, if they may do you any avail.  So Sir
 Palomides armed him hastily in that knight's armour
 and his shield that shone as any crystal or silver, and
 so he came riding into the field.  And then there was
 neither Sir Tristram nor none of King Arthur's party
 that knew Sir Palomides.  And right so as Sir Palomides
 was come into the field Sir Tristram smote down three
 knights, even in the sight of Sir Palomides.  And then
 Sir Palomides rode against Sir Tristram, and either met
 other with great spears, that they brast to their hands.
 And then they dashed together with swords eagerly.
 Then Sir Tristram had marvel what knight he was that
 did battle so knightly with him.  Then was Sir Tristram
 wroth, for he felt him passing strong, so that he deemed
 he might not have ado with the remnant of the knights,
 because of the strength of Sir Palomides.  So they lashed
 together and gave many sad strokes together, and many
 knights marvelled what knight he might be that so
 encountered with the black knight, Sir Tristram.  Full
 well knew La Beale Isoud that there was Sir Palomides
 that fought with Sir Tristram, for she espied all in her
 window where that she stood, as Sir Palomides changed
 his harness with the wounded knight.  And then she
 began to weep so heartily for the despite of Sir Palomides
 that there she swooned.
 
 Then came in Sir Launcelot with the knights of
 Orkney.  And when the other party had espied Sir Launcelot,
 they cried:  Return, return, here cometh Sir Launcelot
 du Lake.  So there came knights and said:  Sir Launcelot, ye
 must needs fight with yonder knight in the black harness,
 that was Sir Tristram, for he hath almost overcome that
 good knight that fighteth with him with the silver shield,
 that was Sir Palomides.  Then Sir Launcelot rode betwixt
 Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides, and Sir Launcelot said to
 Palomides:  Sir knight, let me have the battle, for ye have
 need to be reposed.  Sir Palomides knew Sir Launcelot
 well, and so did Sir Tristram, but because Sir Launcelot
 was far hardier knight than himself therefore he was glad,
 and suffered Sir Launcelot to fight with Sir Tristram.
 For well wist he that Sir Launcelot knew not Sir Tristram,
 and there he hoped that Sir Launcelot should beat or shame
 Sir Tristram, whereof Sir Palomides was full fain.  And
 so Sir Launcelot gave Sir Tristram many sad strokes, but
 Sir Launcelot knew not Sir Tristram, but Sir Tristram
 knew well Sir Launcelot.  And thus they fought long
 together, that La Beale Isoud was well-nigh out of her
 mind for sorrow.
 
 Then Sir Dinadan told Sir Gareth how that knight in
 the black harness was Sir Tristram:  And this is Launcelot
 that fighteth with him, that must needs have the better of
 him, for Sir Tristram hath had too much travail this day.
 Then let us smite him down, said Sir Gareth.  So it is
 better that we do, said Sir Dinadan, than Sir Tristram be
 shamed, for yonder hoveth the strong knight with the
 silver shield to fall upon Sir Tristram if need be.  Then
 forthwithal Gareth rushed upon Sir Launcelot, and gave
 him a great stroke upon his helm so hard that he was
 astonied.  And then came Sir Dinadan with a spear, and
 he smote Sir Launcelot such a buffet that horse and all
 fell to the earth.  O Jesu, said Sir Tristram to Sir Gareth
 and Sir Dinadan, fie for shame, why did ye smite down so
 good a knight as he is, and namely when I had ado with
 him? now ye do yourself great shame, and him no disworship;
 for I held him reasonable hot, though ye had not
 holpen me.
 
 Then came Sir Palomides that was disguised, and smote
 down Sir Dinadan from his horse.  Then Sir Launcelot,
 because Sir Dinadan had smitten him aforehand, then
 Sir Launcelot assailed Sir Dinadan passing sore, and Sir
 Dinadan defended him mightily.  But well understood Sir
 Tristram that Sir Dinadan might not endure Sir Launcelot,
 wherefore Sir Tristram was sorry.  Then came Sir Palomides
 fresh upon Sir Tristram.  And when Sir Tristram
 saw him come, he thought to deliver him at once, because
 that he would help Sir Dinadan, because he stood in great
 peril with Sir Launcelot.  Then Sir Tristram hurtled unto
 Sir Palomides and gave him a great buffet, and then Sir
 Tristram gat Sir Palomides and pulled him down underneath
 him.  And so fell Sir Tristram with him; and Sir
 Tristram leapt up lightly and left Sir Palomides, and went
 betwixt Sir Launcelot and Dinadan, and then they began
 to do battle together.
 
 Right so Sir Dinadan gat Sir Tristram's horse, and
 said on high that Sir Launcelot might hear it:  My lord
 Sir Tristram, take your horse.  And when Sir Launcelot
 heard him name Sir Tristram:  O Jesu, said Launcelot,
 what have I done? I am dishonoured.  Ah, my lord Sir
 Tristram, said Launcelot, why were ye disguised? ye have
 put yourself in great peril this day; but I pray you noble
 knight to pardon me, for an I had known you we had not
 done this battle.  Sir, said Sir Tristram, this is not the
 first kindness ye showed me.  So they were both horsed
 again.
 
 Then all the people on the one side gave Sir Launcelot
 the honour and the degree, and on the other side all the
 people gave to the noble knight Sir Tristram the honour
 and the degree; but Launcelot said nay thereto:  For I am
 not worthy to have this honour, for I will report me unto
 all knights that Sir Tristram hath been longer in the field
 than I, and he hath smitten down many more knights this
 day than I have done.  And therefore I will give Sir
 Tristram my voice and my name, and so I pray all my lords
 and fellows so to do.  Then there was the whole voice
 of dukes and earls, barons and knights, that Sir Tristram
 this day is proved the best knight.
