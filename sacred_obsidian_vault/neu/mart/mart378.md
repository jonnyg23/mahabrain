 CHAPTER V
 
 How a yeoman desired him to get again an horse, and how
 Sir Percivale's hackney was slain, and how he gat an
 horse.
 
 
 AND anon the yeoman came pricking after as fast as ever
 he might, and asked Sir Percivale if he saw any knight
 riding on his black steed.  Yea, sir, forsooth, said he;
 why, sir, ask ye me that?  Ah, sir, that steed he hath
 benome me with strength; wherefore my lord will slay
 me in what place he findeth me.  Well, said Sir Percivale,
 what wouldst thou that I did?  Thou seest well that I am
 on foot, but an I had a good horse I should bring him
 soon again.  Sir, said the yeoman, take mine hackney and
 do the best ye can, and I shall sewe you on foot to wit
 how that ye shall speed.  Then Sir Percivale alighted
 upon that hackney, and rode as fast as he might, and at
 the last he saw that knight.  And then he cried:  Knight,
 turn again; and he turned and set his spear against Sir
 Percivale, and he smote the hackney in the midst of the
 breast that he fell down dead to the earth, and there he
 had a great fall, and the other rode his way.  And then
 Sir Percivale was wood wroth, and cried:  Abide, wicked
 knight; coward and false-hearted knight, turn again and
 fight with me on foot.  But he answered not, but passed
 on his way.
 
 When Sir Percivale saw he would not turn he cast
 away his helm and sword, and said:  Now am I a very
 wretch, cursed and most unhappy above all other knights.
 So in this sorrow he abode all that day till it was night;
 and then he was faint, and laid him down and slept till it
 was midnight; and then he awaked and saw afore him a
 woman which said unto him right fiercely:  Sir Percivale,
 what dost thou here?  He answered, I do neither good
 nor great ill.  If thou wilt ensure me, said she, that thou
 wilt fulfil my will when I summon thee, I shall lend thee
 mine own horse which shall bear thee whither thou wilt.
 Sir Percivale was glad of her proffer, and ensured her to
 fulfil all her desire.  Then abide me here, and I shall go
 and fetch you an horse.  And so she came soon again
 and brought an horse with her that was inly black.  When
 Percivale beheld that horse he marvelled that it was so
 great and so well apparelled; and not for then he was so
 hardy, and he leapt upon him, and took none heed of
 himself.  And so anon as he was upon him he thrust to
 him with his spurs, and so he rode by a forest, and the
 moon shone clear.  And within an hour and less he bare
 him four days' journey thence, until he came to a rough
 water the which roared, and his horse would have borne
 him into it.
