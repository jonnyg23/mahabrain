 CHAPTER XVI
 
 Of the communication between Sir Gawaine and Sir Launcelot,
 with much other language
 
 
 THE king may do as he will, said Sir Gawaine, but wit
 thou well, Sir Launcelot, thou and I shall never be
 accorded while we live, for thou hast slain three of my
 brethren; and two of them ye slew traitorly and piteously,
 for they bare none harness against thee, nor none would
 bear.  God would they had been armed, said Sir Launcelot,
 for then had they been alive.  And wit ye well Sir
 Gawaine, as for Sir Gareth, I love none of my kinsmen so
 much as I did him; and ever while I live, said Sir
 Launcelot, I will bewail Sir Gareth's death, not all only
 for the great fear I have of you, but many causes cause
 me to be sorrowful.  One is, for I made him knight;
 another is, I wot well he loved me above all other knights;
 and the third is, he was passing noble, true, courteous,
 and gentle, and well conditioned; the fourth is, I wist
 well, anon as I heard that Sir Gareth was dead, I should
 never after have your love, but everlasting war betwixt
 us; and also I wist well that ye would cause my noble
 lord Arthur for ever to be my mortal foe.  And as Jesu
 be my help, said Sir Launcelot, I slew never Sir Gareth
 nor Sir Gaheris by my will; but alas that ever they were
 unarmed that unhappy day.  But thus much I shall offer
 me, said Sir Launcelot, if it may please the king's good
 grace, and you, my lord Sir Gawaine, I shall first begin at
 Sandwich, and there I shall go in my shirt, barefoot; and
 at every ten miles' end I will found and gar make an
 house of religion, of what order that ye will assign me,
 with an whole convent, to sing and read, day and night,
 in especial for Sir Gareth's sake and Sir Gaheris.  And
 this shall I perform from Sandwich unto Carlisle; and
 every house shall have sufficient livelihood.  And this
 shall I perform while I have any livelihood in Christendom;
 and there nis none of all these religious places, but
 they shall be performed, furnished and garnished in all
 things as an holy place ought to be, I promise you faithfully.
 And this, Sir Gawaine, methinketh were more
 fairer, holier, and more better to their souls, than ye, my
 most noble king, and you, Sir Gawaine, to war upon me,
 for thereby shall ye get none avail.
 
 Then all knights and ladies that were there wept as
 they were mad, and the tears fell on King Arthur's cheeks.
 Sir Launcelot, said Sir Gawaine, I have right well heard
 thy speech, and thy great proffers, but wit thou well, let
 the king do as it pleased him, I will never forgive my
 brothers' death, and in especial the death of my brother,
 Sir Gareth.  And if mine uncle, King Arthur, will accord
 with thee, he shall lose my service, for wit thou well thou
 art both false to the king and to me.  Sir, said Launcelot
 he beareth not the life that may make that good and if
 ye, Sir Gawaine, will charge me with so high a thing, ye
 must pardon me, for then needs must I answer you.
 Nay, said Sir Gawaine, we are past that at this time, and
 that caused the Pope, for he hath charged mine uncle, the
 king, that he shall take his queen again, and to accord
 with thee, Sir Launcelot, as for this season, and therefore
 thou shalt go safe as thou camest.  But in this land thou
 shalt not abide past fifteen days, such summons I give
 thee: so the king and we were consented and accorded or
 thou camest.  And else, said Sir Gawaine, wit thou well
 thou shouldst not have come here, but if it were maugre
 thy head.  And if it were not for the Pope's commandment,
 said Sir Gawaine, I should do battle with mine own
 body against thy body, and prove it upon thee, that thou
 hast been both false unto mine uncle King Arthur, and to
 me both; and that shall I prove upon thy body, when
 thou art departed from hence, wheresomever I find thee.
