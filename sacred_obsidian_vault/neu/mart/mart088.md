 CHAPTER XXVIII
 
 How at the year's end all three knights with their three
 damosels met at the fountain.
 
 RIGHT so at the twelvemonths' end they met all three knights at
 the fountain and their damosels, but the damosel that Sir Gawaine
 had could say but little worship of him so they departed from the
 damosels and rode through a great forest, and there they met with
 a messenger that came from King Arthur, that had sought them
 well-nigh a twelvemonth throughout all England, Wales, and
 Scotland, and charged if ever he might find Sir Gawaine and Sir
 Uwaine to bring them to the court again.  And then were they all
 glad, and so prayed they Sir Marhaus to ride with them to the
 king's court.  And so within twelve days they came to Camelot,
 and the king was passing glad of their coming, and so was all the
 court.  Then the king made them to swear upon a book to tell him
 all their adventures that had befallen them that twelvemonth, and
 so they did.  And there was Sir Marhaus well known, for there
 were knights that he had matched aforetime, and he was named one
 of the best knights living.
 
 Against the feast of Pentecost came the Damosel of the Lake and
 brought with her Sir Pelleas; and at that high feast there was
 great jousting of knights, and of all knights that were at that
 jousts, Sir Pelleas had the prize, and Sir Marhaus was named the
 next; but Sir Pelleas was so strong there might but few knights
 sit him a buffet with a &lt;148&gt;spear.  And at that next feast Sir
 Pelleas and Sir Marhaus were made knights of the Table Round, for
 there were two sieges void, for two knights were slain that
 twelvemonth, and great joy had King Arthur of Sir Pelleas and of
 Sir Marhaus.  But Pelleas loved never after Sir Gawaine, but as
 he spared him for the love of King Arthur; but ofttimes at jousts
 and tournaments Sir Pelleas quit Sir Gawaine, for so it
 rehearseth in the book of French.  So Sir Tristram many days
 after fought with Sir Marhaus in an island, and there they did a
 great battle, but at the last Sir Tristram slew him, so Sir
 Tristram was wounded that unnethe he might recover, and lay at a
 nunnery half a year.  And Sir Pelleas was a worshipful knight,
 and was one of the four that achieved the Sangreal, and the
 Damosel of the Lake made by her means that never he had ado with
 Sir Launcelot de Lake, for where Sir Launcelot was at any jousts
 or any tournament, she would not suffer him be there that day,
 but if it were on the side of Sir Launcelot.
