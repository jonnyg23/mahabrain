 CHAPTER V
 
 How Balin was pursued by Sir Lanceor, knight of Ireland,
 and how he jousted and slew him.
 
 AND so this Lady Lile of Avelion took her this sword that she
 brought with her, and told there should no man pull it out of the
 sheath but if he be one of the best knights of this realm, and he
 should be hard and full of prowess, and with that sword he should
 slay her brother.  This was the cause that the damosel came into
 this court.  I know it as well as ye.  Would God she had not come
 into this court, but she came never in fellowship of worship to
 do good, but always great harm; and that &lt;56&gt;knight that hath
 achieved the sword shall be destroyed by that sword, for the
 which will be great damage, for there liveth not a knight of more
 prowess than he is, and he shall do unto you, my Lord Arthur,
 great honour and kindness; and it is great pity he shall not
 endure but a while, for of his strength and hardiness I know not
 his match living.
 
 So the knight of Ireland armed him at all points, and dressed his
 shield on his shoulder, and mounted upon horseback, and took his
 spear in his hand, and rode after a great pace, as much as his
 horse might go; and within a little space on a mountain he had a
 sight of Balin, and with a loud voice he cried, Abide, knight,
 for ye shall abide whether ye will or nill, and the shield that
 is to-fore you shall not help.  When Balin heard the noise, he
 turned his horse fiercely, and said, Fair knight, what will ye
 with me, will ye joust with me?  Yea, said the Irish knight,
 therefore come I after you.  Peradventure, said Balin, it had
 been better to have holden you at home, for many a man weeneth to
 put his enemy to a rebuke, and oft it falleth to himself.  Of
 what court be ye sent from? said Balin.  I am come from the court
 of King Arthur, said the knight of Ireland, that come hither for
 to revenge the despite ye did this day to King Arthur and to his
 court.  Well, said Balin, I see well I must have ado with you,
 that me forthinketh for to grieve King Arthur, or any of his
 court; and your quarrel is full simple, said Balin, unto me, for
 the lady that is dead, did me great damage, and else would I have
 been loath as any knight that liveth for to slay a lady.  Make
 you ready, said the knight Lanceor, and dress you unto me, for
 that one shall abide in the field.  Then they took their spears,
 and came together as much as their horses might drive, and the
 Irish knight smote Balin on the shield, that all went shivers off
 his spear, and Balin hit him through the shield, and the hauberk
 perished, and so pierced through his body and the horse's croup,
 and anon turned his horse fiercely, and drew out his sword, and
 wist not that he had slain him; and then he saw him lie as a dead
 corpse.
