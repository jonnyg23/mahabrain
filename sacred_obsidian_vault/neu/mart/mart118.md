 CHAPTER XVIII
 
 How Sir Launcelot came to King Arthur's Court, and how
 there were recounted all his noble feats and acts.
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot du Lake, that came home two days
 afore the Feast of Pentecost; and the king and all the court were
 passing fain of his coming.  And when Sir Gawaine, Sir Uwaine,
 Sir Sagramore, Sir Ector de Maris, saw Sir Launcelot in Kay's
 armour, then they wist well it was he that smote them down all
 with one spear.  Then there was laughing and smiling among them. 
 And ever now and now came all the knights home that Sir Turquine
 had prisoners, and they all honoured and worshipped Sir
 Launcelot.
 
 When Sir Gaheris heard them speak, he said, I saw all the battle
 from the beginning to the ending, and there he told King Arthur
 all how it was, and how Sir Turquine was the strongest knight
 that ever he saw except Sir Launcelot: there were many knights
 bare him record, nigh three score.  Then Sir Kay told the king
 how Sir Launcelot had rescued him when he should have been slain,
 and how he made the knights yield them to me, and not to him. 
 And there they were all three, and bare record.  And by Jesu,
 said Sir Kay, because Sir Launcelot took my harness and left me
 his I rode in good peace, and no man would have ado with me.
 
 Anon therewithal there came the three knights that fought with
 Sir Launcelot at the long bridge.  And there they yielded them
 unto Sir Kay, and Sir Kay forsook them and said he fought never
 with them.  But I shall ease your heart, said Sir Kay, yonder is
 Sir Launcelot that &lt;208&gt;overcame you.  When they wist that they
 were glad.  And then Sir Meliot de Logres came home, and told the
 king how Sir Launcelot had saved him from the death.  And all his
 deeds were known, how four queens, sorceresses, had him in
 prison, and how he was delivered by King Bagdemagus' daughter. 
 Also there were told all the great deeds of arms that Sir
 Launcelot did betwixt the two kings, that is for to say the King
 of Northgalis and King Bagdemagus.  All the truth Sir Gahalantine
 did tell, and Sir Mador de la Porte and Sir Mordred, for they
 were at that same tournament.  Then came in the lady that knew
 Sir Launcelot when that he wounded Sir Belleus at the pavilion. 
 And there, at request of Sir Launcelot, Sir Belleus was made
 knight of the Round Table.  And so at that time Sir Launcelot had
 the greatest name of any knight of the world, and most he was
 honoured of high and low.
 
 Explicit the noble tale of Sir Launcelot du Lake,
 which is the vi. book.  Here followeth the tale of
 Sir Gareth of Orkney that was called Beaumains
 by Sir Kay, and is the seventh book.
