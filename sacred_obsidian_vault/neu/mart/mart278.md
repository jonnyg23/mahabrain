 CHAPTER XLI
 
 How Sir Launcelot fought in the tournament, and how Sir
 Palomides did arms there for a damosel.
 
 
 THEN at the request of Queen Guenever and of King
 Bagdemagus Sir Launcelot came into the range, but he
 was disguised, and that was the cause that few folk knew
 him; and there met with him Sir Ector de Maris, his
 own brother, and either brake their spears upon other to
 their hands.  And then either gat another spear.  And
 then Sir Launcelot smote down Sir Ector de Maris, his
 own brother.  That saw Sir Bleoberis, and he smote Sir
 Launcelot such a buffet upon the helm that he wist not
 well where he was.  Then Sir Launcelot was wrothy and
 smote Sir Bleoberis so sore upon the helm that his head
 bowed down backward.  And he smote eft another buffet,
 that he avoided his saddle; and so he rode by, and thrust
 forth to the thickest.  When the King of Northgalis saw
 Sir Ector and Bleoberis lie on the ground then was he
 wroth, for they came on his party against them of Surluse.
 So the King of Northgalis ran to Sir Launcelot, and brake
 a spear upon him all to pieces.  Therewith Sir Launcelot
 overtook the King of Northgalis, and smote him such a
 buffet on the helm with his sword that he made him to
 avoid his horse; and anon the king was horsed again.
 So both the King Bagdemagus' and the King of North-galis'
 party hurled to other; and then began a strong
 medley, but they of Northgalis were far bigger.
 
 When Sir Launcelot saw his party go to the worst he
 thrang into the thickest press with a sword in his hand;
 and there he smote down on the right hand and on the
 left hand, and pulled down knights and raced off their
 helms, that all men had wonder that ever one knight
 might do such deeds of arms.  When Sir Meliagaunce,
 that was son unto King Bagdemagus, saw how Sir
 Launcelot fared he marvelled greatly.  And when he
 understood that it was he, he wist well that he was
 disguised for his sake.  Then Sir Meliagaunce prayed a
 knight to slay Sir Launcelot's horse, either with sword or
 with spear.  At that time King Bagdemagus met with a
 knight that hight Sauseise, a good knight, to whom he said:
 Now fair Sauseise, encounter with my son Meliagaunce
 and give him large payment, for I would he were well
 beaten of thy hands, that he might depart out of this field.
 And then Sir Sauseise encountered with Sir Meliagaunce,
 and either smote other down.  And then they fought on
 foot, and there Sauseise had won Sir Meliagaunce, had
 there not come rescues.  So then the haut prince blew to
 lodging, and every knight unarmed him and went to the
 great feast.
 
 Then in the meanwhile there came a damosel to the
 haut prince, and complained that there was a knight that
 hight Goneries that withheld her all her lands.  Then the
 knight was there present, and cast his glove to her or to
 any that would fight in her name.  So the damosel took
 up the glove all heavily for default of a champion.  Then
 there came a varlet to her and said:  Damosel, will ye do
 after me?  Full fain, said the damosel.  Then go you unto
 such a knight that lieth here beside in an hermitage, and
 that followeth the Questing Beast, and pray him to take
 the battle upon him, and anon I wot well he will grant
 you.
 
 So anon she took her palfrey, and within a while she
 found that knight, that was Sir Palomides.  And when
 she required him he armed him and rode with her, and
 made her to go to the haut prince, and to ask leave for
 her knight to do battle.  I will well, said the haut prince.
 Then the knights were ready in the field to joust on
 horseback; and either gat a spear in their hands, and
 met so fiercely together that their spears all to-shivered.
 Then they flang out swords, and Sir Palomides smote Sir
 Goneries down to the earth.  And then he raced off his
 helm and smote off his head.  Then they went to supper,
 and the damosel loved Palomides as paramour, but the
 book saith she was of his kin.  So then Palomides disguised
 himself in this manner, in his shield he bare the
 Questing Beast, and in all his trappings.  And when he
 was thus ready, he sent to the haut prince to give him
 leave to joust with other knights, but he was adoubted of
 Sir Launcelot.  The haut prince sent him word again that
 he should be welcome, and that Sir Launcelot should not
 joust with him.  Then Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, let
 cry what knight somever he were that smote down Sir
 Palomides should have his damosel to himself.
