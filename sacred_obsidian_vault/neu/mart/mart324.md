 CHAPTER LXXXVII
 
 How there was a day set between Sir Tristram and Sir
 Palomides for to fight, and how Sir Tristram was hurt.
 
 
 THEN said Sir Tristram:  I will fight with you to the
 uttermost.  I grant, said Palomides, for in a better
 quarrel keep I never to fight, for an I die of your hands,
 of a better knight's hands may I not be slain.  And sithen
 I understand that I shall never rejoice La Beale Isoud, I
 have as good will to die as to live.  Then set ye a day,
 said Sir Tristram, that we shall do battle.  This day
 fifteen days, said Palomides, will I meet with you hereby,
 in the meadow under Joyous Gard.  Fie for shame, said
 Sir Tristram, will ye set so long day? let us fight
 to-morn.  Not so, said Palomides, for I am meagre, and
 have been long sick for the love of La Beale Isoud, and
 therefore I will repose me till I have my strength again.
 So then Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides promised faith
 fully to meet at the well that day fifteen days.  I am
 remembered, said Sir Tristram to Palomides, that ye
 brake me once a promise when that I rescued you from
 Breuse Saunce Pit<e> and nine knights; and then ye
 promised me to meet me at the peron and the grave
 beside Camelot, whereas at that time ye failed of your
 promise.  Wit you well, said Palomides unto Sir Tristram,
 I was at that day in prison, so that I might not hold my
 promise.  So God me help, said Sir Tristram, an ye
 had holden your promise this work had not been here
 now at this time.
 
 Right so departed Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides.
 And so Sir Palomides took his horse and his harness, and
 he rode unto King Arthur's court; and there Sir Palomides
 gat him four knights and four sergeants-of-arms,
 and so he returned againward unto Joyous Gard.  And
 in the meanwhile Sir Tristram chased and hunted at all
 manner of venery; and about three days afore the battle
 should be, as Sir Tristram chased an hart, there was an
 archer shot at the hart, and by misfortune he smote Sir
 Tristram in the thick of the thigh, and the arrow slew
 Sir Tristram's horse and hurt him.  When Sir Tristram
 was so hurt he was passing heavy, and wit ye well he bled
 sore; and then he took another horse, and rode unto
 Joyous Gard with great heaviness, more for the promise
 that he had made with Sir Palomides, as to do battle with
 him within three days after, than for any hurt of his thigh.
 Wherefore there was neither man nor woman that could
 cheer him with anything that they could make to him,
 neither Queen La Beale Isoud; for ever he deemed that
 Sir Palomides had smitten him so that he should not be
 able to do battle with him at the day set.
