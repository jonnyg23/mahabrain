 CHAPTER III
 
 How King Arthur held a parliament at York, and how he
 ordained the realm should be governed in his absence.
 
 NOW leave we of Lucius the Emperor and speak we of King Arthur,
 that commanded all them of his retinue to be ready at the utas of
 Hilary for to hold a parliament at &lt;154&gt;York.  And at that
 parliament was concluded to arrest all the navy of the land, and
 to be ready within fifteen days at Sandwich, and there he showed
 to his army how he purposed to conquer the empire which he ought
 to have of right.  And there he ordained two governors of this
 realm, that is to say, Sir Baudwin of Britain, for to counsel to
 the best, and Sir Constantine, son to Sir Cador of Cornwall,
 which after the death of Arthur was king of this realm.  And in
 the presence of all his lords he resigned the rule of the realm
 and Guenever his queen to them, wherefore Sir Launcelot was
 wroth, for he left Sir Tristram with King Mark for the love of
 Beale Isould.  Then the Queen Guenever made great sorrow for the
 departing of her lord and other, and swooned in such wise that
 the ladies bare her into her chamber.  Thus the king with his
 great army departed, leaving the queen and realm in the
 governance of Sir Baudwin and Constantine.  And when he was on
 his horse he said with an high voice, If I die in this journey I
 will that Sir Constantine be mine heir and king crowned of this
 realm as next of my blood.  And after departed and entered into
 the sea at Sandwich with all his army, with a great multitude of
 ships, galleys, cogs, and dromounds, sailing on the sea.
