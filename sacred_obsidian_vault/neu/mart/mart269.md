 CHAPTER XXXII
 
 How King Mark slew by treason his brother Boudwin, for
 good service that he had done to him.
 
 
 NOW turn we to another matter that fell between
 King Mark and his brother, that was called the good
 Prince Boudwin, that all the people of the country loved
 passing well.  So it befell on a time that the miscreant
 Saracens landed in the country of Cornwall soon after
 these Sessoins were gone.  And then the good Prince
 Boudwin, at the landing, he raised the country privily and
 hastily.  And or it were day he let put wildfire in three
 of his own ships, and suddenly he pulled up the sail, and
 with the wind he made those ships to be driven among
 the navy of the Saracens.  And to make short tale, those
 three ships set on fire all the ships, that none were saved.
 And at point of the day the good Prince Boudwin with
 all his fellowship set on the miscreants with shouts and
 cries, and slew to the number of forty thousand, and left
 none alive.
 
 When King Mark wist this he was wonderly wroth
 that his brother should win such worship.  And because
 this prince was better beloved than he in all that country,
 and that also Boudwin loved well Sir Tristram, therefore
 he thought to slay him.  And thus, hastily, as a man out
 of his wit, he sent for Prince Boudwin and Anglides his
 wife, and bade them bring their young son with them,
 that he might see him.  All this he did to the intent to
 slay the child as well as his father, for he was the falsest
 traitor that ever was born.  Alas, for his goodness and
 for his good deeds this gentle Prince Boudwin was slain.
 So when he came with his wife Anglides, the king made
 them fair semblant till they had dined.  And when they
 had dined King Mark sent for his brother and said thus:
 Brother, how sped you when the miscreants arrived by
 you? meseemeth it had been your part to have sent me
 word, that I might have been at that journey, for it had
 been reason that I had had the honour and not you.
 Sir, said the Prince Boudwin, it was so that an I had
 tarried till that I had sent for you those miscreants had
 destroyed my country.  Thou liest, false traitor, said
 King Mark, for thou art ever about for to win worship
 from me, and put me to dishonour, and thou cherishest
 that I hate.  And therewith he struck him to the heart
 with a dagger, that he never after spake word.  Then the
 Lady Anglides made great dole, and swooned, for she saw
 her lord slain afore her face.  Then was there no more to
 do but Prince Boudwin was despoiled and brought to
 burial.  But Anglides privily gat her husband's doublet
 and his shirt, and that she kept secretly.
 
 Then was there much sorrow and crying, and great
 dole made Sir Tristram, Sir Dinas, Sir Fergus, and so did
 all knights that were there; for that prince was passingly
 well beloved.  So La Beale Isoud sent unto Anglides, the
 Prince Boudwin's wife, and bade her avoid lightly or else
 her young son, Alisander le Orphelin, should be slain
 When she heard this, she took her horse and her child;
 and rode with such poor men as durst ride with her.
