 CHAPTER XII
 
 How the six knights sent Sir Dagonet to joust with King
 Mark, and how King Mark refused him.
 
 
 AND then they asked him of his adventures, and whether
 he had seen Sir Tristram or Sir Launcelot.  So God me
 help, said Sir Dinadan, I saw none of them sithen I
 departed from Camelot.  What knight is that, said Sir
 Brandiles, that so suddenly departed from you, and rode
 over yonder field?  Sir, said he, it was a knight of
 Cornwall, and the most horrible coward that ever bestrode
 horse.  What is his name? said all these knights.  I wot
 not, said Sir Dinadan.  So when they had reposed them,
 and spoken together, they took their horses and rode to a
 castle where dwelt an old knight that made all knights-errant
 good cheer.  Then in the meanwhile that they were
 talking came into the castle Sir Griflet le Fise de Dieu,
 and there was he welcome; and they all asked him whether
 he had seen Sir Launcelot or Sir Tristram.  Sirs, he
 answered, I saw him not sithen he departed from Camelot.
 So as Sir Dinadan walked and beheld the castle, thereby in
 a chamber he espied King Mark, and then he rebuked
 him, and asked him why he departed so.  Sir, said he, for
 I durst not abide because they were so many.  But how
 escaped ye? said King Mark.  Sir, said Sir Dinadan, they
 were better friends than I weened they had been.  Who
 is captain of that fellowship? said the king.  Then for to
 fear him Sir Dinadan said that it was Sir Launcelot.  O
 Jesu, said the king, might I know Sir Launcelot by his
 shield? Yea, said Dinadan, for he beareth a shield of
 silver and black bends.  All this he said to fear the king,
 for Sir Launcelot was not in his fellowship.  Now I pray
 you, said King Mark, that ye will ride in my fellowship.
 That is me loath to do, said Sir Dinadan, because ye forsook
 my fellowship.
 
 Right so Sir Dinadan went from King Mark, and went
 to his own fellowship; and so they mounted upon their
 horses, and rode on their ways, and talked of the Cornish
 knight, for Dinadan told them that he was in the castle
 where they were lodged.  It is well said, said Sir Griflet,
 for here have I brought Sir Dagonet, King Arthur's fool,
 that is the best fellow and the merriest in the world.  Will
 ye do well? said Sir Dinadan:  I have told the Cornish
 knight that here is Sir Launcelot, and the Cornish knight
 asked me what shield he bare.  Truly, I told him that he
 bare the same shield that Sir Mordred beareth.  Will ye
 do well? said Sir Mordred; I am hurt and may not well
 bear my shield nor harness, and therefore put my shield
 and my harness upon Sir Dagonet, and let him set upon
 the Cornish knight.  That shall be done, said Sir Dagonet,
 by my faith.  Then anon was Dagonet armed him in
 Mordred's harness and his shield, and he was set on a
 great horse, and a spear in his hand.  Now, said Dagonet,
 shew me the knight, and I trow I shall bear him down.
 So all these knights rode to a woodside, and abode till
 King Mark came by the way.  Then they put forth Sir
 Dagonet, and he came on all the while his horse might
 run, straight upon King Mark.  And when he came nigh
 King Mark, he cried as he were wood, and said:  Keep
 thee, knight of Cornwall, for I will slay thee.  Anon, as
 King Mark beheld his shield, he said to himself:  Yonder
 is Sir Launcelot; alas, now am I destroyed; and therewithal
 he made his horse to run as fast as it might through
 thick and thin.  And ever Sir Dagonet followed after King
 Mark, crying and rating him as a wood man, through a
 great forest.  When Sir Uwaine and Sir Brandiles saw
 Dagonet so chase King Mark, they laughed all as they
 were wood.  And then they took their horses, and rode
 after to see how Sir Dagonet sped, for they would not for
 no good that Sir Dagonet were shent, for King Arthur
 loved him passing well, and made him knight with his own
 hands.  And at every tournament he began to make King
 Arthur to laugh.  Then the knights rode here and there,
 crying and chasing after King Mark, that all the forest
 rang of the noise.
