 CHAPTER LXXI
 
 How Sir Launcelot said to Sir Palomides, and how the
 prize of that day was given unto Sir Palomides.
 
 
 WHEN Sir Ector de Maris saw Sir Launcelot his brother
 have such a despite, and so set on foot, then he gat a
 spear eagerly, and ran against Sir Palomides, and he smote
 him so hard that he bare him quite from his horse.  That
 saw Sir Tristram, that was in red harness, and he smote
 down Sir Ector de Maris quite from his horse.  Then
 Sir Launcelot dressed his shield upon his shoulder, and
 with his sword naked in his hand, and so came straight
 upon Sir Palomides fiercely and said:  Wit thou well
 thou hast done me this day the greatest despite that ever
 any worshipful knight did to me in tournament or in
 jousts, and therefore I will be avenged upon thee, therefore
 take keep to yourself.  Ah, mercy, noble knight,
 said Palomides, and forgive me mine unkindly deeds,
 for I have no power nor might to withstand you, and I
 have done so much this day that well I wot I did never
 so much, nor never shall in my life-days; and therefore,
 most noble knight, I require thee spare me as at this
 day, and I promise you I shall ever be your knight while
 I live: an ye put me from my worship now, ye put me
 from the greatest worship that ever I had or ever shall
 have in my life-days.  Well, said Sir Launcelot, I see,
 for to say thee sooth, ye have done marvellously well
 this day; and I understand a part for whose love ye do
 it, and well I wot that love is a great mistress.  And if
 my lady were here as she nis not, wit you well, said Sir
 Launcelot, ye should not bear away the worship.  But
 beware your love be not discovered, for an Sir Tristram
 may know it ye will repent it; and sithen my quarrel
 is not here, ye shall have this day the worship as for me;
 considering the great travail and pain that ye have had
 this day, it were no worship for me to put you from it.
 And therewithal Sir Launcelot suffered Sir Palomides to
 depart.
 
 Then Sir Launcelot by great force and might gat
 his own horse maugre twenty knights.  So when Sir
 Launcelot was horsed he did many marvels, and so did
 Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides in like wise.  Then Sir
 Launcelot smote down with a spear Sir Dinadan, and the
 King of Scotland, and the King of Wales, and the King
 of Northumberland, and the King of Listinoise.  So then
 Sir Launcelot and his fellows smote down well a forty
 knights.  Then came the King of Ireland and the King
 of the Straight Marches to rescue Sir Tristram and Sir
 Palomides.  There began a great medley, and many
 knights were smitten down on both parties; and always Sir
 Launcelot spared Sir Tristram, and he spared him.  And
 Sir Palomides would not meddle with Sir Launcelot, and
 so there was hurtling here and there.  And then King
 Arthur sent out many knights of the Table Round; and
 Sir Palomides was ever in the foremost front, and Sir
 Tristram did so strongly well that the king and all other
 had marvel.  And then the king let blow to lodging;
 and because Sir Palomides began first, and never he went
 nor rode out of the field to repose, but ever he was
 doing marvellously well either on foot or on horseback,
 and longest during, King Arthur and all the kings gave
 Sir Palomides the honour and the gree as for that day.
 
 Then Sir Tristram commanded Sir Dinadan to fetch
 the queen La Beale Isoud, and bring her to his two
 pavilions that stood by the well.  And so Dinadan did as
 he was commanded.  But when Sir Palomides understood
 and wist that Sir Tristram was in the red armour, and on
 a red horse, wit ye well that he was glad, and so was Sir
 Gareth and Sir Dinadan, for they all weened that Sir
 Tristram had been taken prisoner.  And then every
 knight drew to his inn.  And then King Arthur and every
 knight spake of those knights; but above all men they
 gave Sir Palomides the prize, and all knights that knew
 Sir Palomides had wonder of his deeds.  Sir, said Sir
 Launcelot unto Arthur, as for Sir Palomides an he be the
 green knight I dare say as for this day he is best worthy
 to have the degree, for he reposed him never, nor never
 changed his weeds, and he began first and longest held on.
 And yet, well I wot, said Sir Launcelot, that there was a
 better knight than he, and that shall be proved or we
 depart, upon pain of my life.  Thus they talked on either
 party; and so Sir Dinadan railed with Sir Tristram and
 said:  What the devil is upon thee this day? for Sir
 Palomides' strength feebled never this day, but ever he
 doubled his strength.
