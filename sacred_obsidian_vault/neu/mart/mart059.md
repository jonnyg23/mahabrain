 CHAPTER XIV
 
 How on the way he heard two knights, as he lay by night in
 a valley, and of their adventures.
 
 AND therewith he armed him.  So right even afore him there met
 two knights, the one came froward Camelot, and the other from the
 north, and either saluted other.  What tidings at Camelot? said
 the one.  By my head, said the other, there have I been and
 espied the court of King Arthur, and there is such a fellowship
 they may never be broken, and well-nigh all the world holdeth
 with Arthur, for there is the flower of chivalry.  Now for this
 cause I am riding into the north, to tell our chieftains of the
 fellowship that is withholden with King Arthur.  &lt;99&gt;As for that,
 said the other knight, I have brought a remedy with me, that is
 the greatest poison that ever ye heard speak of, and to Camelot
 will I with it, for we have a friend right nigh King Arthur, and
 well cherished, that shall poison King Arthur; for so he hath
 promised our chieftains, and received great gifts for to do it. 
 Beware, said the other knight, of Merlin, for he knoweth all
 things by the devil's craft.  Therefore will I not let it, said
 the knight.  And so they departed asunder.  Anon after Pellinore
 made him ready, and his lady, [and] rode toward Camelot; and as
 they came by the well there as the wounded knight was and the
 lady, there he found the knight, and the lady eaten with lions or
 wild beasts, all save the head, wherefore he made great sorrow,
 and wept passing sore, and said, Alas! her life might I have
 saved; but I was so fierce in my quest, therefore I would not
 abide.  Wherefore make ye such dole? said the lady.  I wot not,
 said Pellinore, but my heart mourneth sore of the death of her,
 for she was a passing fair lady and a young.  Now, will ye do by
 mine advice? said the lady, take this knight and let him be
 buried in an hermitage, and then take the lady's head and bear it
 with you unto Arthur.  So King Pellinore took this dead knight on
 his shoulders, and brought him to the hermitage, and charged the
 hermit with the corpse, that service should be done for the soul;
 and take his harness for your pain.  It shall be done, said the
 hermit, as I will answer unto God.
