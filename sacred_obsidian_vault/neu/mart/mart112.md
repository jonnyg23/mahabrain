 CHAPTER XII
 
 How Sir Launcelot rode disguised in Sir Kay's harness, and
 how he smote down a knight.
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Launcelot that had ridden long in a great
 forest, and at the last he came into a low country, full of fair
 rivers and meadows.  And afore him he saw a long bridge, and
 three pavilions stood thereon, of silk and sendal of divers hue. 
 And without the pavilions hung three white shields on truncheons
 of spears, and great long spears stood upright by the pavilions,
 and at every pavilion's door stood three fresh squires, and so
 Sir Launcelot passed by them and spake no word.  When he was
 passed the three knights said them that it was the proud Kay; He
 weeneth no knight so good as he, and the contrary is ofttime
 proved.  By my faith, said one of the knights, his name was Sir
 Gaunter, I will ride after him and assay him for all his pride,
 and ye may behold how that I speed.  So this knight, Sir Gaunter,
 armed him, and hung his shield upon his shoulder, and mounted
 upon a great horse, and gat his spear in his hand, and walloped
 after Sir Launcelot.  And when he came nigh him, he cried, Abide,
 thou proud knight Sir Kay, for thou shalt not pass quit.  So Sir
 Launcelot turned him, and either feutred their spears, and came
 together with all their mights, and Sir Gaunter's spear brake,
 but Sir Launcelot smote him down horse and man.  And when Sir
 Gaunter was at the earth his brethren said each one to other,
 Yonder knight is not Sir Kay, for he is bigger than he.  I dare
 lay my head, said Sir Gilmere, yonder knight hath slain Sir Kay
 and hath taken his horse and his harness.  Whether it be so or
 no, said Sir Raynold, the third brother, let us now go mount upon
 our horses and rescue our brother Sir Gaunter, upon pain of
 death.  We all shall have work enough to match that knight, for
 ever meseemeth by his person it is Sir &lt;197&gt;Launcelot, or Sir
 Tristram, or Sir Pelleas, the good knight.
 
 Then anon they took their horses and overtook Sir Launcelot, and
 Sir Gilmere put forth his spear, and ran to Sir Launcelot, and
 Sir Launcelot smote him down that he lay in a swoon.  Sir knight,
 said Sir Raynold, thou art a strong man, and as I suppose thou
 hast slain my two brethren, for the which raseth my heart sore
 against thee, and if I might with my worship I would not have ado
 with you, but needs I must take part as they do, and therefore,
 knight, he said, keep thyself.  And so they hurtled together with
 all their mights, and all to-shivered both their spears.  And
 then they drew their swords and lashed together eagerly.  Anon
 therewith arose Sir Gaunter, and came unto his brother Sir
 Gilmere, and bade him, Arise, and help we our brother Sir
 Raynold, that yonder marvellously matched yonder good knight. 
 Therewithal, they leapt on their horses and hurtled unto Sir
 Launcelot.
 
 And when he saw them come he smote a sore stroke unto Sir
 Raynold, that he fell off his horse to the ground, and then he
 struck to the other two brethren, and at two strokes he struck
 them down to the earth.  With that Sir Raynold began to start up
 with his head all bloody, and came straight unto Sir Launcelot. 
 Now let be, said Sir Launcelot, I was not far from thee when thou
 wert made knight, Sir Raynold, and also I know thou art a good
 knight, and loath I were to slay thee.  Gramercy, said Sir
 Raynold, as for your goodness; and I dare say as for me and my
 brethren, we will not be loath to yield us unto you, with that we
 knew your name, for well we know ye are not Sir Kay.  As for that
 be it as it be may, for ye shall yield you unto dame Guenever,
 and look that ye be with her on Whitsunday, and yield you unto
 her as prisoners, and say that Sir Kay sent you unto her.  Then
 they swore it should be done, and so passed forth Sir Launcelot,
 and each one of the brethren holp other as well as they might.
