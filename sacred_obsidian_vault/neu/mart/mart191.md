 CHAPTER XXXVIII
 
 How Sir Tristram and his wife arrived in Wales, and how
 he met there with Sir Lamorak.
 
 NOW turn we unto Sir Tristram, that upon a day he took a little
 barget, and his wife Isoud la Blanche Mains, with Sir Kehydius
 her brother, to play them in the coasts.  And when they were from
 the land, there was a wind drove them in to the coast of Wales
 upon this Isle of Servage, whereas was Sir Lamorak, and there the
 barget all to-rove; and there Dame Isoud was hurt; and as well as
 they might they gat into the forest, and there by a well he saw
 Segwarides and a damosel.  And then either saluted other.  Sir,
 said Segwarides, I know you for Sir Tristram de Liones, the man
 in the world that I have most cause to hate, because ye departed
 the love between me and my wife; but as for that, said Sir
 Segwarides, I will never hate a noble knight for a light lady;
 and therefore, I pray you, be my friend, and I will be yours unto
 my power; for wit ye well ye are hard bestead in this valley, and
 we shall have enough to do either of us to succour other.  And
 then Sir Segwarides brought Sir Tristram to a lady thereby that
 was born in Cornwall, and she told him all the perils of that
 valley, and how there came never knight there but he were taken
 prisoner or slain.  Wit you well, fair lady, said Sir Tristram,
 that I slew Sir Marhaus and delivered Cornwall from the truage of
 Ireland, and I am he that delivered the King of Ireland from Sir
 Blamore de Ganis, and I am he that beat Sir Palamides; and wit ye
 well I am Sir Tristram de Liones, that by the grace of God shall
 deliver this woful Isle of Servage.  So Sir Tristram was well
 eased.
 
 Then one told him there was a knight of King Arthur's that was
 wrecked on the rocks.  What is his name? said Sir Tristram.  We
 wot not, said the fishers, but he keepeth it no counsel but that
 he is a knight of &lt;343&gt;King Arthur's, and by the mighty lord of
 this isle he setteth nought.  I pray you, said Sir Tristram, an
 ye may, bring him hither that I may see him, and if he be any of
 the knights of Arthur's I shall know him.  Then the lady prayed
 the fishers to bring him to her place.  So on the morrow they
 brought him thither in a fisher's raiment; and as soon as Sir
 Tristram saw him he smiled upon him and knew him well, but he
 knew not Sir Tristram.  Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, meseemeth by
 your cheer ye have been diseased but late, and also methinketh I
 should know you heretofore.  I will well, said Sir Lamorak, that
 ye have seen me and met with me.  Fair sir, said Sir Tristram,
 tell me your name.  Upon a covenant I will tell you, said Sir
 Lamorak, that is, that ye will tell me whether ye be lord of this
 island or no, that is called Nabon le Noire.  Forsooth, said Sir
 Tristram, I am not he, nor I hold not of him; I am his foe as
 well as ye be, and so shall I be found or I depart out of this
 isle.  Well, said Sir Lamorak, since ye have said so largely unto
 me, my name is Sir Lamorak de Galis, son unto King Pellinore. 
 Forsooth, I trow well, said Sir Tristram, for an ye said other I
 know the contrary.  What are ye, said Sir Lamorak, that knoweth
 me?  I am Sir Tristram de Liones.  Ah, sir, remember ye not of
 the fall ye did give me once, and after ye refused me to fight on
 foot.  That was not for fear I had of you, said Sir Tristram, but
 me shamed at that time to have more ado with you, for meseemed ye
 had enough; but, Sir Lamorak, for my kindness many ladies ye put
 to a reproof when ye sent the horn from Morgan le Fay to King
 Mark, whereas ye did this in despite of me.  Well, said he, an it
 were to do again, so would I do, for I had liefer strife and
 debate fell in King Mark's court rather than Arthur's court, for
 the honour of both courts be not alike.  As to that, said Sir
 Tristram, I know well; but that that was done it was for despite
 of me, but all your malice, I thank God, hurt not greatly. 
 Therefore, said Sir Tristram, ye shall leave all your malice, and
 so will I, and let us assay how we may win worship between you
 and me upon this giant Sir Nabon le &lt;344&gt;Noire that is lord of
 this island, to destroy him.  Sir, said Sir Lamorak, now I
 understand your knighthood, it may not be false that all men say,
 for of your bounty, noblesse, and worship, of all knights ye are
 peerless, and for your courtesy and gentleness I showed you
 ungentleness, and that now me repenteth.
