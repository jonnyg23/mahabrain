 CHAPTER I
 
 How Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred were busy upon Sir
 Gawaine for to disclose the love between Sir Launcelot
 and Queen Guenever
 
 
 IN May when every lusty heart flourisheth and bourgeoneth,
 for as the season is lusty to behold and comfortable,
 so man and woman rejoice and gladden of summer
 coming with his fresh flowers: for winter with his rough
 winds and blasts causeth a lusty man and woman to cower
 and sit fast by the fire.  So in this season, as in the month
 of May, it befell a great anger and unhap that stinted not
 till the flower of chivalry of all the world was destroyed
 and slain; and all was long upon two unhappy knights
 the which were named Agravaine and Sir Mordred, that
 were brethren unto Sir Gawaine.  For this Sir Agravaine
 and Sir Mordred had ever a privy hate unto the queen
 Dame Guenever and to Sir Launcelot, and daily and
 nightly they ever watched upon Sir Launcelot.
 
 So it mishapped, Sir Gawaine and all his brethren were in
 King Arthur's chamber; and then Sir Agravaine said thus
 openly, and not in no counsel, that many knights might
 hear it:  I marvel that we all be not ashamed both to see
 and to know how Sir Launcelot lieth daily and nightly by
 the queen, and all we know it so; and it is shamefully
 suffered of us all, that we all should suffer so noble a king
 as King Arthur is so to be shamed.
 
 Then spake Sir Gawaine, and said:  Brother Sir Agravaine,
 I pray you and charge you move no such matters
 no more afore me, for wit you well, said Sir Gawaine, I
 will not be of your counsel.  So God me help, said Sir
 Gaheris and Sir Gareth, we will not be knowing, brother
 Agravaine, of your deeds.  Then will I, said Sir Mordred.
 I lieve well that, said Sir Gawaine, for ever unto
 all unhappiness, brother Sir Mordred, thereto will ye grant;
 and I would that ye left all this, and made you not so
 busy, for I know, said Sir Gawaine, what will fall of it.
 Fall of it what fall may, said Sir Agravaine, I will disclose
 it to the king.  Not by my counsel, said Sir Gawaine, for
 an there rise war and wrack betwixt Sir Launcelot and us,
 wit you well brother, there will many kings and great
 lords hold with Sir Launcelot.  Also, brother Sir Agravaine,
 said Sir Gawaine, ye must remember how ofttimes
 Sir Launcelot hath rescued the king and the queen; and
 the best of us all had been full cold at the heart-root had not
 Sir Launcelot been better than we, and that hath he proved
 himself full oft.  And as for my part, said Sir Gawaine, I
 will never be against Sir Launcelot for one day's deed,
 when he rescued me from King Carados of the Dolorous
 Tower, and slew him, and saved my life.  Also, brother
 Sir Agravaine and Sir Mordred, in like wise Sir Launcelot
 rescued you both, and threescore and two, from Sir
 Turquin.  Methinketh brother, such kind deeds and kindness
 should be remembered.  Do as ye list, said Sir Agravaine,
 for I will lain it no longer.  With these words came to
 them King Arthur.  Now brother, stint your noise, said
 Sir Gawaine.  We will not, said Sir Agravaine and Sir
 Mordred.  Will ye so? said Sir Gawaine; then God
 speed you, for I will not hear your tales ne be of your
 counsel.  No more will I, said Sir Gareth and Sir Gaheris,
 for we will never say evil by that man; for because, said
 Sir Gareth, Sir Launcelot made me knight, by no manner
 owe I to say ill of him: and therewithal they three
 departed, making great dole.  Alas, said Sir Gawaine and
 Sir Gareth, now is this realm wholly mischieved, and the
 noble fellowship of the Round Table shall be disparpled:
 so they departed.
