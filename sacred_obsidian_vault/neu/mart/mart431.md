 CHAPTER II
 
 How the queen commanded Sir Launcelot to avoid the court,
 and of the sorrow that Launcelot made.
 
 
 ALL this while the queen stood still and let Sir Launcelot
 say what he would.  And when he had all said she brast
 out a-weeping, and so she sobbed and wept a great while.
 And when she might speak she said:  Launcelot, now I
 well understand that thou art a false recreant knight and
 a common lecher, and lovest and holdest other ladies, and
 by me thou hast disdain and scorn.  For wit thou well,
 she said, now I understand thy falsehood, and therefore
 shall I never love thee no more.  And never be thou so
 hardy to come in my sight; and right here I discharge
 thee this court, that thou never come within it; and I
 forfend thee my fellowship, and upon pain of thy head
 that thou see me no more.  Right so Sir Launcelot departed
 with great heaviness, that unnethe he might sustain
 himself for great dole-making.
 
 Then he called Sir Bors, Sir Ector de Maris, and Sir
 Lionel, and told them how the queen had forfended him
 the court, and so he was in will to depart into his own
 country.  Fair sir, said Sir Bors de Ganis, ye shall not
 depart out of this land by mine advice.  Ye must remember
 in what honour ye are renowned, and called the
 noblest knight of the world; and many great matters ye
 have in hand.  And women in their hastiness will do
 ofttimes that sore repenteth them; and therefore by mine
 advice ye shall take your horse, and ride to the good
 hermitage here beside Windsor, that sometime was a good
 knight, his name is Sir Brasias, and there shall ye abide
 till I send you word of better tidings.  Brother, said Sir
 Launcelot, wit ye well I am full loath to depart out of
 this realm, but the queen hath defended me so highly,
 that meseemeth she will never be my good lady as she
 hath been.  Say ye never so, said Sir Bors, for many
 times or this time she hath been wroth with you, and
 after it she was the first that repented it.  Ye say well,
 said Launcelot, for now will I do by your counsel, and
 take mine horse and my harness, and ride to the hermit
 Sir Brasias, and there will I repose me until I hear some
 manner of tidings from you; but, fair brother, I pray
 you get me the love of my lady, Queen Guenever, an ye
 may Sir, said Sir Bors, ye need not to move me of such
 matters, for well ye wot I will do what I may to please
 you.
 
 And then the noble knight, Sir Launcelot, departed
 with right heavy cheer suddenly, that none earthly creature
 wist of him, nor where he was become, but Sir Bors.  So
 when Sir Launcelot was departed, the queen outward
 made no manner of sorrow in showing to none of his
 blood nor to none other.  But wit ye well, inwardly, as
 the book saith, she took great thought, but she bare it
 out with a proud countenance as though she felt nothing
 nor danger.
