 CHAPTER X
 
 How Sir Tor found the brachet with a lady, and how a
 knight assailed him for the said brachet.
 
 THEREWITH Sir Tor alighted and took the dwarf his glaive, and so
 he came to the white pavilion, and saw three damosels lie in it,
 on one pallet, sleeping, and so he went to the other pavilion,
 and found a lady lying sleeping therein, but there was the white
 brachet that bayed at her fast, and therewith the lady yede out
 of the pavilion and all her damosels.  But anon as Sir Tor espied
 the white brachet, he took her by force and took her to the
 dwarf.  What, will ye so, said the lady, take my brachet from me? 
 Yea, said Sir Tor, this brachet have I sought from King Arthur's
 court hither.  Well, said the lady, knight, ye shall not go far
 with her, but that ye shall be met and grieved.  I shall abide
 what adventure that cometh by the grace of God, and so mounted
 upon his horse, and passed on his way toward Camelot; but it was
 so near night he might not pass but little further.  Know ye any
 lodging? said Tor.  I know none, said the dwarf, but here beside
 is an hermitage, and there ye must take lodging as ye find.  And
 within a while they came to the hermitage and took lodging; and
 was there grass, oats and bread for their horses; soon it was
 sped, and full hard was their supper; but there they rested them
 all night till on the morn, and heard a mass devoutly, and took
 their leave of the hermit, and Sir Tor prayed the hermit to pray
 for him.  He said he would, and betook him to God.  And so
 mounted upon horseback and rode towards Camelot a long while.
 
 With that they heard a knight call loud that came after them, and
 he said, Knight, abide and yield my brachet that thou took from
 my lady.  Sir Tor returned again, and beheld him how he was a
 seemly knight and well horsed, and well armed at all points; then
 Sir Tor dressed his shield, and took his spear in his hands, and
 the other came fiercely upon him, and smote both horse and man to
 the &lt;93&gt;earth.  Anon they arose lightly and drew their swords as
 eagerly as lions, and put their shields afore them, and smote
 through the shields, that the cantels fell off both parties. 
 Also they tamed their helms that the hot blood ran out, and the
 thick mails of their hauberks they carved and rove in sunder that
 the hot blood ran to the earth, and both they had many wounds and
 were passing weary.  But Sir Tor espied that the other knight
 fainted, and then he sued fast upon him, and doubled his strokes,
 and gart him go to the earth on the one side.  Then Sir Tor bade
 him yield him.  That will I not, said Abelleus, while my life
 lasteth and the soul is within my body, unless that thou wilt
 give me the brachet.  That will I not do, said Sir Tor, for it
 was my quest to bring again thy brachet, thee, or both.
