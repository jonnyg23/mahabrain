 CHAPTER LXXXVI
 
 How Sir Tristram and Launcelot, with Palomides, came to
 joyous Gard; and of Palomides and Sir Tristram.
 
 
 FAIR knight, said Sir Tristram unto Sir Launcelot, of
 whence be ye?  I am a knight errant, said Sir Launcelot,
 that rideth to seek many adventures.  What is your name?
 said Sir Tristram.  Sir, at this time I will not tell you.
 Then Sir Launcelot said unto Sir Tristram and to Palomides:
 Now either of you are met together I will depart
 from you.  Not so, said Sir Tristram; I pray you of
 knighthood to ride with me unto my castle.  Wit you
 well, said Sir Launcelot, I may not ride with you, for I
 have many deeds to do in other places, that at this time
 I may not abide with you.  Ah, mercy Jesu, said Sir
 Tristram, I require you as ye be a true knight to the order
 of knighthood, play you with me this night.  Then Sir
 Tristram had a grant of Sir Launcelot: howbeit though
 he had not desired him he would have ridden with them,
 outher soon have come after them; for Sir Launcelot came
 for none other cause into that country but for to see Sir
 Tristram.  And when they were come within Joyous
 Gard they alighted, and their horses were led into a stable;
 and then they unarmed them.  And when Sir Launcelot
 was unhelmed, Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides knew him.
 Then Sir Tristram took Sir Launcelot in arms, and so did
 La Beale Isoud; and Palomides kneeled down upon his
 knees and thanked Sir Launcelot.  When Sir Launcelot
 saw Sir Palomides kneel he lightly took him up and said
 thus:  Wit thou well, Sir Palomides, I and any knight in
 this land, of worship ought of very right succour and
 rescue so noble a knight as ye are proved and renowned,
 throughout all this realm endlong and overthwart.  And
 then was there joy among them, and the oftener that
 Sir Palomides saw La Beale Isoud the heavier he waxed
 day by day.
 
 Then Sir Launcelot within three or four days departed,
 and with him rode Sir Ector de Maris; and Dinadan and
 Sir Palomides were there left with Sir Tristram a two
 months and more.  But ever Sir Palomides faded and
 mourned, that all men had marvel wherefore he faded so
 away.  So upon a day, in the dawning, Sir Palomides went
 into the forest by himself alone; and there he found a
 well, and then he looked into the well, and in the water he
 saw his own visage, how he was disturbed and defaded,
 nothing like that he was.  What may this mean? said Sir
 Palomides, and thus he said to himself:  Ah, Palomides,
 Palomides, why art thou defaded, thou that was wont to be
 called one of the fairest knights of the world?  I will no
 more lead this life, for I love that I may never get nor
 recover.  And therewithal he laid him down by the well.
 And then he began to make a rhyme of La Beale Isoud
 and him.
 
 And in the meanwhile Sir Tristram was that same day
 ridden into the forest to chase the hart of greese; but Sir
 Tristram would not ride a-hunting never more unarmed,
 because of Sir Breuse Saunce Pit<e>.  And so as Sir Tristram
 rode into that forest up and down, he heard one sing
 marvellously loud, and that was Sir Palomides that lay by
 the well.  And then Sir Tristram rode softly thither, for
 he deemed there was some knight errant that was at the
 well.  And when Sir Tristram came nigh him he descended
 down from his horse and tied his horse fast till a tree, and
 then he came near him on foot; and anon he was ware
 where lay Sir Palomides by the well and sang loud and
 merrily; and ever the complaints were of that noble
 queen, La Beale Isoud, the which was marvellously and
 wonderfully well said, and full dolefully and piteously
 made.  And all the whole song the noble knight, Sir
 Tristram, heard from the beginning to the ending, the
 which grieved and troubled him sore.
 
 But then at the last, when Sir Tristram had heard all
 Sir Palomides' complaints, he was wroth out of measure,
 and thought for to slay him thereas he lay.  Then Sir
 Tristram remembered himself that Sir Palomides was
 unarmed, and of the noble name that Sir Palomides had,
 and the noble name that himself had, and then he made a
 restraint of his anger; and so he went unto Sir Palomides
 a soft pace and said:  Sir Palomides, I have heard your
 complaint, and of thy treason that thou hast owed me
 so long, and wit thou well therefore thou shalt die; and
 if it were not for shame of knighthood thou shouldest
 not escape my hands, for now I know well thou hast
 awaited me with treason.  Tell me, said Sir Tristram,
 how thou wilt acquit thee?  Sir, said Palomides, thus I
 will acquit me: as for Queen La Beale Isoud, ye shall wit
 well that I love her above all other ladies in this world;
 and well I wot it shall befall me as for her love as befell
 to the noble knight Sir Kehydius, that died for the love
 of La Beale Isoud.  And now, Sir Tristram, I will that
 ye wit that I have loved La Beale Isoud many a day, and
 she hath been the causer of my worship, and else I had
 been the most simplest knight in the world.  For by her,
 and because of her, I have won the worship that I have;
 for when I remembered me of La Beale Isoud I won the
 worship wheresomever I came for the most part; and yet
 had I never reward nor bount<e> of her the days of my life,
 and yet have I been her knight guerdonless.  And therefore,
 Sir Tristram, as for any death I dread not, for I had
 as lief die as to live.  And if I were armed as thou art, I
 should lightly do battle with thee.  Well have ye uttered
 your treason, said Tristram.  I have done to you no
 treason, said Palomides, for love is free for all men, and
 though I have loved your lady, she is my lady as well as
 yours; howbeit I have wrong if any wrong be, for ye
 rejoice her, and have your desire of her, and so had I
 never nor never am like to have, and yet shall I love her
 to the uttermost days of my life as well as ye.
