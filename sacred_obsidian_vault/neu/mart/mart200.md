 CHAPTER VI
 
 How Sir Launcelot fought with six knights, and after
 with Sir Brian, and how he delivered the prisoners.
 
 AH, said Sir Launcelot, that knight is my fellow, and him shall I
 rescue or else I shall lose my life therefore.  And therewithal
 he rode fast till he came before the Castle of Pendragon; and
 anon therewithal there came six knights, and all made them ready
 to set upon Sir Launcelot at once; then Sir Launcelot feutred his
 spear, and smote the &lt;361&gt;foremost that he brake his back in-
 sunder, and three of them hit and three failed.  And then Sir
 Launcelot passed through them, and lightly he turned in again,
 and smote another knight through the breast and throughout the
 back more than an ell, and therewithal his spear brake.  So then
 all the remnant of the four knights drew their swords and lashed
 at Sir Launcelot.  And at every stroke Sir Launcelot bestowed so
 his strokes that at four strokes sundry they avoided their
 saddles, passing sore wounded; and forthwithal he rode hurling
 into that castle.
 
 And anon the lord of the castle, that was that time cleped Sir
 Brian de les Isles, the which was a noble man and a great enemy
 unto King Arthur, within a while he was armed and upon horseback. 
 And then they feutred their spears and hurled together so
 strongly that both their horses rashed to the earth.  And then
 they avoided their saddles, and dressed their shields, and drew
 their swords, and flang together as wood men, and there were many
 strokes given in a while.  At the last Sir Launcelot gave to Sir
 Brian such a buffet that he kneeled upon his knees, and then Sir
 Launcelot rashed upon him, and with great force he pulled off his
 helm; and when Sir Brian saw that he should be slain he yielded
 him, and put him in his mercy and in his grace.  Then Sir
 Launcelot made him to deliver all his prisoners that he had
 within his castle, and therein Sir Launcelot found of Arthur's
 knights thirty, and forty ladies, and so he delivered them; and
 then he rode his way.  And anon as La Cote Male Taile was
 delivered he gat his horse, and his harness, and his damosel
 Maledisant.
 
 The meanwhile Sir Nerovens, that Sir Launcelot had foughten
 withal afore at the bridge, he sent a damosel after Sir Launcelot
 to wit how he sped at the Castle of Pendragon.  And then they
 within the castle marvelled what knight he was, when Sir Brian
 and his knights delivered all those prisoners.  Have ye no
 marvel, said the damosel, for the best knight in this world was
 here, and did this journey, and wit ye well, she said, it was Sir
 Launcelot.  Then was Sir Brian full glad, and so was his
 &lt;362&gt;lady, and all his knights, that such a man should win them. 
 And when the damosel and La Cote Male Taile understood that it
 was Sir Launcelot du Lake that had ridden with them in
 fellowship, and that she remembered her how she had rebuked him
 and called him coward, then was she passing heavy.
