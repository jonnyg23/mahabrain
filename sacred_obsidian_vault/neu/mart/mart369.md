 CHAPTER XVI
 
 How Sir Gawaine came to the abbey for to follow Galahad,
 and how he was shriven to a hermit.
 
 
 NOW, saith the tale, after Sir Gawaine departed, he rode
 many journeys, both toward and froward.  And at the
 last he came to the abbey where Sir Galahad had the white
 shield, and there Sir Gawaine learned the way to sewe after
 Sir Galahad; and so he rode to the abbey where Melias
 lay sick, and there Sir Melias told Sir Gawaine of the
 marvellous adventures that Sir Galahad did.  Certes, said
 Sir Gawaine, I am not happy that I took not the way that
 he went, for an I may meet with him I will not depart
 from him lightly, for all marvellous adventures Sir
 Galahad enchieveth.  Sir, said one of the monks, he will
 not of your fellowship.  Why? said Sir Gawaine.  Sir,
 said he, for ye be wicked and sinful, and he is full blessed.
 Right as they thus stood talking there came in riding Sir
 Gareth.  And then they made joy either of other.  And
 on the morn they heard mass, and so departed.  And by
 the way they met with Sir Uwaine les Avoutres, and
 there Sir Uwaine told Sir Gawaine how he had met with
 none adventure sith he departed from the court.  Nor
 we, said Sir Gawaine.  And either promised other of the
 three knights not to depart while they were in that quest,
 but if fortune caused it.
 
 So they departed and rode by fortune till that they
 came by the Castle of Maidens; and there the seven
 brethren espied the three knights, and said:  Sithen, we
 be flemed by one knight from this castle, we shall destroy
 all the knights of King Arthur's that we may overcome,
 for the love of Sir Galahad.  And therewith the seven
 knights set upon the three knights, and by fortune Sir
 Gawaine slew one ot the brethren, and each one of his
 fellows slew another, and so slew the remnant.  And then
 they took the way under the castle, and there they lost
 the way that Sir Galahad rode, and there everych of
 them departed from other; and Sir Gawaine rode till he
 came to an hermitage, and there he found the good man
 saying his evensong of Our Lady; and there Sir Gawaine
 asked harbour for charity, and the good man granted it
 him gladly.
 
 Then the good man asked him what he was.  Sir,
 he said, I am a knight of King Arthur's that am in the
 quest of the Sangreal, and my name is Sir Gawaine.
 Sir, said the good man, I would wit how it standeth
 betwixt God and you.  Sir, said Sir Gawaine, I will
 with a good will shew you my life if it please you;
 and there he told the hermit how a monk of an abbey
 called me wicked knight.  He might well say it, said
 the hermit, for when ye were first made knight ye
 should have taken you to knightly deeds and virtuous
 living, and ye have done the contrary, for ye have
 lived mischievously many winters; and Sir Galahad is
 a maid and sinned never, and that is the cause he shall
 enchieve where he goeth that ye nor none such shall
 not attain, nor none in your fellowship, for ye have
 used the most untruest life that ever I heard knight
 live.  For certes had ye not been so wicked as ye are,
 never had the seven brethren been slain by you and
 your two fellows.  For Sir Galahad himself alone beat
 them all seven the day to-fore, but his living is such
 he shall slay no man lightly.  Also I may say you the
 Castle of Maidens betokeneth the good souls that were
 in prison afore the Incarnation of Jesu Christ.  And the
 seven knights betoken the seven deadly sins that reigned
 that time in the world; and I may liken the good
 Galahad unto the son of the High Father, that lighted
 within a maid, and bought all the souls out of thrall,
 so did Sir Galahad deliver all the maidens out of the
 woful castle.
 
 Now, Sir Gawaine, said the good man, thou must
 do penance for thy sin.  Sir, what penance shall I do?
 Such as I will give, said the good man.  Nay, said
 Sir Gawaine, I may do no penance; for we knights
 adventurous oft suffer great woe and pain.  Well, said
 the good man, and then he held his peace.  And on the
 morn Sir Gawaine departed from the hermit, and betaught
 him unto God.  And by adventure he met with Sir
 Aglovale and Sir Griflet, two knights of the Table
 Round.  And they two rode four days without finding
 of any adventure, and at the fifth day they departed.
 And everych held as fell them by adventure.  Here
 leaveth the tale of Sir Gawaine and his fellows, and speak
 we of Sir Galahad.
