 CHAPTER XVIII
 
 How the lady forsook Sir Tristram and abode with Sir
 Bleoberis, and how she desired to go to her husband.
 
 So when she was set betwixt them both she said these words unto
 Sir Tristram:  Wit ye well, Sir Tristram de Liones, that but late
 thou wast the man in the world that I most loved and trusted, and
 I weened thou hadst loved me again above all ladies; but when
 thou sawest this knight lead me away thou madest no cheer to
 rescue me, but suffered my lord Segwarides ride after me; but
 until that time I weened thou haddest loved me, and therefore now
 I will leave thee, and never love thee more.  And therewithal she
 went unto Sir Bleoberis.
 
 When Sir Tristram saw her do so he was wonderly wroth with that
 lady, and ashamed to come to the court.  Sir Tristram, said Sir
 Bleoberis, ye are in the default, for I hear by this lady's words
 she before this day trusted you above all earthly knights, and,
 as she saith, ye have deceived her, therefore wit ye well, there
 may no man hold that will away; and rather than ye should be
 heartily &lt;309&gt;displeased with me I would ye had her, an she would
 abide with you.  Nay, said the lady, so God me help I will never
 go with him; for he that I loved most I weened he had loved me. 
 And therefore, Sir Tristram, she said, ride as thou came, for
 though thou haddest overcome this knight, as ye was likely, with
 thee never would I have gone.  And I shall pray this knight so
 fair of his knighthood, that or ever he pass this country, that
 he will lead me to the abbey where my lord Sir Segwarides lieth. 
 So God me help, said Bleoberis, I let you wit, good knight Sir
 Tristram, because King Mark gave me the choice of a gift in this
 court, and so this lady liked me best--notwithstanding, she is
 wedded and hath a lord, and I have fulfilled my quest, she shall
 be sent unto her husband again, and in especial most for your
 sake, Sir Tristram; and if she would go with you I would ye had
 her.  I thank you, said Sir Tristram, but for her love I shall
 beware what manner a lady I shall love or trust; for had her
 lord, Sir Segwarides, been away from the court, I should have
 been the first that should have followed you; but sithen that ye
 have refused me, as I am true knight I shall her know passingly
 well that I shall love or trust.  And so they took their leave
 one from the other and departed.
 
 And so Sir Tristram rode unto Tintagil, and Sir Bleoberis rode
 unto the abbey where Sir Segwarides lay sore wounded, and there
 he delivered his lady, and departed as a noble knight; and when
 Sir Segwarides saw his lady, he was greatly comforted; and then
 she told him that Sir Tristram had done great battle with Sir
 Bleoberis, and caused him to bring her again.  These words
 pleased Sir Segwarides right well, that Sir Tristram would do so
 much; and so that lady told all the battle unto King Mark betwixt
 Sir Tristram and Sir Bleoberis.
