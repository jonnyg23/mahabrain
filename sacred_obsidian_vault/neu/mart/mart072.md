 CHAPTER XII
 
 How Arthur accorded the two brethren, and delivered the
 twenty knights, and how Sir Accolon died.
 
 THEN all the people fell down on their knees and cried King
 Arthur mercy.  Mercy shall ye have, said Arthur: here may ye see
 what adventures befall ofttime of errant knights, how that I have
 fought with a knight of mine own unto my great damage and his
 both.  But, sirs, because I am sore hurt, and he both, and I had
 great need of a little rest, ye shall understand the opinion
 betwixt you two brethren:  As to thee, Sir Damas, for whom I have
 been champion and won the field of this knight, yet will I judge
 because ye, Sir Damas, are called an orgulous knight, and full of
 villainy, and not worth of prowess your deeds, therefore I will
 that ye give unto your brother all the whole manor with the
 appurtenance, under this form, that Sir Ontzlake hold the manor
 of you, and yearly to give you a palfrey to ride upon, for that
 will become you better to ride on than upon a courser.  Also I
 charge thee, Sir Damas, upon pain of death, that thou never
 distress no knights errant that ride on their adventure.  And
 also that thou restore these twenty knights that thou hast long
 kept prisoners, of all their harness, that they be content for;
 and if any of them come to my court and complain of thee, by my
 head thou shalt die therefore.  Also, Sir Ontzlake, as to you,
 because ye are named a good knight, and full of prowess, and true
 and gentle in all your deeds, this shall be your charge I will
 give you, that in all goodly haste ye come unto me and my court,
 and ye shall be a knight of mine, and if your deeds be thereafter
 I shall so prefer you, by the grace of God, that ye shall in
 short time be in ease for to live as worshipfully as your brother
 Sir Damas.  God thank your largeness of your goodness and of your
 bounty, I shall be from henceforward at all times at your
 commandment; for, sir, said Sir Ontzlake, &lt;121&gt;as God would, as I
 was hurt but late with an adventurous knight through both my
 thighs, that grieved me sore, and else had I done this battle
 with you.  God would, said Arthur, it had been so, for then had
 not I been hurt as I am.  I shall tell you the cause why: for I
 had not been hurt as I am, had it not been mine own sword, that
 was stolen from me by treason; and this battle was ordained
 aforehand to have slain me, and so it was brought to the purpose
 by false treason, and by false enchantment.  Alas, said Sir
 Ontzlake, that is great pity that ever so noble a man as ye are
 of your deeds and prowess, that any man or woman might find in
 their hearts to work any treason against you.  I shall reward
 them, said Arthur, in short time, by the grace of God.  Now, tell
 me, said Arthur, how far am I from Camelot?  Sir, ye are two
 days' journey therefrom.  I would fain be at some place of
 worship, said Sir Arthur, that I might rest me.  Sir, said Sir
 Ontzlake, hereby is a rich abbey of your elders' foundation, of
 nuns, but three miles hence.  So the king took his leave of all
 the people, and mounted upon horseback, and Sir Accolon with him. 
 And when they were come to the abbey, he let fetch leeches and
 search his wounds and Accolon's both; but Sir Accolon died within
 four days, for he had bled so much blood that he might not live,
 but King Arthur was well recovered.  So when Accolon was dead he
 let send him on an horse-bier with six knights unto Camelot, and
 said:  Bear him to my sister Morgan le Fay, and say that I send
 her him to a present, and tell her I have my sword Excalibur and
 the scabbard; so they departed with the body.
