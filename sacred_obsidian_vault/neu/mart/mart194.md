 CHAPTER XLI
 
 How Sir Lamorak slew Sir Frol, and of the courteous
 fighting with Sir Belliance his brother.
 
 THEN within two or three days Sir Lamorak found a knight at a
 well sleeping, and his lady sat with him and waked.  Right so
 came Sir Gawaine and took the knight's lady, and set her up
 behind his squire.  So Sir Lamorak rode after Sir Gawaine, and
 said:  Sir Gawaine, turn again.  And then said Sir Gawaine:  What
 will ye do with me? for I am nephew unto King Arthur.  Sir, said
 he, for that cause I will spare you, else that lady should abide
 with me, or else ye should joust with me.  Then Sir Gawaine
 turned him and ran to him that ought the lady, with his spear,
 but the knight with pure might smote &lt;349&gt;down Sir Gawaine, and
 took his lady with him.  All this Sir Lamorak saw, and said to
 himself:  But I revenge my fellow he will say of me dishonour in
 King Arthur's court.  Then Sir Lamorak returned and proffered
 that knight to joust.  Sir, said he, I am ready.  And there they
 came together with all their might, and there Sir Lamorak smote
 the knight through both sides that he fell to the earth dead.
 
 Then that lady rode to that knight's brother that hight Belliance
 le Orgulus, that dwelt fast thereby, and then she told him how
 his brother was slain.  Alas, said he, I will be revenged.  And
 so he horsed him, and armed him, and within a while he overtook
 Sir Lamorak, and bade him:  Turn and leave that lady, for thou
 and I must play a new play; for thou hast slain my brother Sir
 Frol, that was a better knight than ever wert thou.  It might
 well be, said Sir Lamorak, but this day in the field I was found
 the better.  So they rode together, and unhorsed other, and
 turned their shields, and drew their swords, and fought mightily
 as noble knights proved, by the space of two hours.  So then Sir
 Belliance prayed him to tell him his name.  Sir, said he, my name
 is Sir Lamorak de Galis.  Ah, said Sir Belliance, thou art the
 man in the world that I most hate, for I slew my sons for thy
 sake, where I saved thy life, and now thou hast slain my brother
 Sir Frol.  Alas, how should I be accorded with thee; therefore
 defend thee, for thou shalt die, there is none other remedy. 
 Alas, said Sir Lamorak, full well me ought to know you, for ye
 are the man that most have done for me.  And therewithal Sir
 Lamorak kneeled down, and besought him of grace.  Arise, said Sir
 Belliance, or else thereas thou kneelest I shall slay thee.  That
 shall not need, said Sir Lamorak, for I will yield me unto you,
 not for fear of you, nor for your strength, but your goodness
 maketh me full loath to have ado with you; wherefore I require
 you for God's sake, and for the honour of knighthood, forgive me
 all that I have offended unto you.  Alas, said Belliance, leave
 thy kneeling, or else I shall slay thee without mercy.
 
 &lt;350&gt;
 Then they yede again unto battle, and either wounded other, that
 all the ground was bloody thereas they fought.  And at the last
 Belliance withdrew him aback and set him down softly upon a
 little hill, for he was so faint for bleeding that he might not
 stand.  Then Sir Lamorak threw his shield upon his back, and
 asked him what cheer.  Well, said Sir Belliance.  Ah, Sir, yet
 shall I show you favour in your mal-ease.  Ah, Knight Sir
 Belliance, said Sir Lamorak, thou art a fool, for an I had had
 thee at such advantage as thou hast done me, I should slay thee;
 but thy gentleness is so good and so large, that I must needs
 forgive thee mine evil will.  And then Sir Lamorak kneeled down,
 and unlaced first his umberere, and then his own, and then either
 kissed other with weeping tears.  Then Sir Lamorak led Sir
 Belliance to an abbey fast by, and there Sir Lamorak would not
 depart from Belliance till he was whole.  And then they sware
 together that none of them should never fight against other.  So
 Sir Lamorak departed and went to the court of King Arthur.
 
 Here leave we of Sir Lamorak and of Sir Tristram.
 And here beginneth the history of La Cote Male Taile.
