 CHAPTER XXVIII
 
 How Sir Launcelot met with Sir Carados bearing away
 Sir Gawaine, and of the rescue of Sir Gawaine.
 
 AND then Sir Tristram took his leave when he saw his time, and
 took the sea.  And in the meanwhile word came unto Sir Launcelot
 and to Sir Tristram that Sir Carados, the mighty king, that was
 made like a giant, fought with Sir Gawaine, and gave him such
 strokes that he swooned in his saddle, and after that he took him
 by the collar and pulled him out of his saddle, and fast bound
 him to the saddle-bow, and so rode his way with him toward his
 castle.  And as he rode, by fortune Sir Launcelot met with Sir
 Carados, and anon he knew Sir Gawaine that lay bound after him. 
 Ah, said Sir Launcelot unto Sir Gawaine, how stands it with you? 
 Never so hard, said Sir Gawaine, unless that ye help me, for so
 God me help, without ye rescue me I know no knight that may, but
 outher you or Sir Tristram.  Wherefore Sir Launcelot was heavy of
 Sir Gawaine's words.  And then Sir Launcelot bade Sir Carados: 
 Lay down that knight and fight with me.  Thou art but a fool,
 said Sir Carados, for I will serve you in the same wise.  As for
 that, said Sir Launcelot, spare me not, for I warn thee I will
 not spare thee.  And then he bound Sir Gawaine hand and foot, and
 so threw him to the ground.  And then he gat his spear of his
 squire, and departed from Sir Launcelot to fetch his course.  And
 so either met with other, and brake their spears to their hands;
 and then they pulled out swords, and hurtled together on
 horseback more than an hour.  And at the last Sir Launcelot smote
 Sir Carados such a buffet upon the helm that it pierced his
 brain-pan.  So then Sir Launcelot took Sir Carados by the collar
 and pulled him under his horse's feet, and then he alighted and
 pulled off his helm and struck off his head.  And then Sir
 Launcelot unbound Sir Gawaine.  So this same tale &lt;326&gt;was told
 to Sir Galahad and to Sir Tristram:--here may ye hear the
 nobleness that followeth Sir Launcelot.  Alas, said Sir Tristram,
 an I had not this message in hand with this fair lady, truly I
 would never stint or I had found Sir Launcelot.  Then Sir
 Tristram and La Beale Isoud went to the sea and came into
 Cornwall, and there all the barons met them.
