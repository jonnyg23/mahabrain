 CHAPTER III
 
 How Sir Launcelot was displeased when he knew that he
 had lain by Dame Elaine, and how she was delivered
 of Galahad.
 
 
 AND anon as he had unshut the window the enchantment
 was gone; then he knew himself that he had done amiss.
 Alas, he said, that I have lived so long; now I am
 shamed.  So then he gat his sword in his hand and said:
 Thou traitress, what art thou that I have lain by all this
 night? thou shalt die right here of my hands.  Then this
 fair lady Elaine skipped out of her bed all naked, and
 kneeled down afore Sir Launcelot, and said:  Fair courteous
 knight, come of king's blood, I require you have mercy
 upon me, and as thou art renowned the most noble knight
 of the world, slay me not, for I have in my womb him by
 thee that shall be the most noblest knight of the world.
 Ah, false traitress, said Sir Launcelot, why hast thou
 betrayed me? anon tell me what thou art.  Sir, she said,
 I am Elaine, the daughter of King Pelles.  Well, said Sir
 Launcelot, I will forgive you this deed; and therewith he
 took her up in his arms, and kissed her, for she was as fair
 a lady, and thereto lusty and young, and as wise, as any
 was that time living.  So God me help, said Sir Launcelot,
 I may not wite this to you; but her that made this
 enchantment upon me as between you and me, an I may
 find her, that same Lady Brisen, she shall lose her head
 for witchcrafts, for there was never knight deceived so as
 I am this night.  And so Sir Launcelot arrayed him, and
 armed him, and took his leave mildly at that lady young
 Elaine, and so he departed.  Then she said:  My lord Sir
 Launcelot, I beseech you see me as soon as ye may, for I
 have obeyed me unto the prophecy that my father told
 me.  And by his commandment to fulfil this prophecy I
 have given the greatest riches and the fairest flower that
 ever I had, and that is my maidenhood that I shall never
 have again; and therefore, gentle knight, owe me your
 good will.
 
 And so Sir Launcelot arrayed him and was armed,
 and took his leave mildly at that young lady Elaine; and
 so he departed, and rode till he came to the Castle of
 Corbin, where her father was.  And as fast as her time
 came she was delivered of a fair child, and they christened
 him Galahad; and wit ye well that child was well kept
 and well nourished, and he was named Galahad because
 Sir Launcelot was so named at the fountain stone; and
 after that the Lady of the Lake confirmed him Sir Launcelot
 du Lake.
 
 Then after this lady was delivered and churched, there
 came a knight unto her, his name was Sir Bromel la Pleche,
 the which was a great lord; and he had loved that lady
 long, and he evermore desired her to wed her; and so by
 no mean she could put him off, till on a day she said to Sir
 Bromel:  Wit thou well, sir knight, I will not love you,
 for my love is set upon the best knight of the world.
 Who is he? said Sir Bromel.  Sir, she said, it is Sir
 Launcelot du Lake that I love and none other, and therefore
 woo me no longer.  Ye say well, said Sir Bromel, and
 sithen ye have told me so much, ye shall have but little joy
 of Sir Launcelot, for I shall slay him wheresomever I meet
 him.  Sir, said the Lady Elaine, do to him no treason.
 Wit ye well, my lady, said Bromel, and I promise you
 this twelvemonth I shall keep the pont of Corbin for Sir
 Launcelot's sake, that he shall neither come nor go unto
 you, but I shall meet with him.
