 CHAPTER II
 
 How five kings came into this land to war against King
 Arthur, and what counsel Arthur had against them.
 
 AND as King Arthur rode to Camelot, and held there a great feast
 with mirth and joy, so soon after he returned unto Cardoile, and
 there came unto Arthur new tidings that the king of Denmark, and
 the king of Ireland that was his brother, and the king of the
 Vale, and the king of Soleise, and the king of the Isle of
 Longtains, all these five kings with a great host were entered
 into the land of King Arthur, and burnt and slew clean afore
 them, both cities and castles, that it was pity to hear.  Alas,
 said Arthur, yet had I never rest one month since I was crowned
 king of this land.  Now shall I never rest till I meet with those
 kings in a fair field, that I make mine avow; for my true liege
 people shall not be destroyed in my default, go with me who will,
 and abide who that will.  Then the king let write unto King
 Pellinore, and prayed him in all haste to make him ready with
 such people as he might lightliest rear and hie him after in all
 haste.  All the barons were privily wroth that the king would
 depart so suddenly; but the king by no mean would abide, but made
 writing unto them that were not there, and bade them hie after
 him, such as were not at that time in the court.  Then the king
 came to Queen Guenever, and said, Lady, make you ready, for ye
 shall go with me, for I may not long miss you; ye shall cause me
 to be the more hardy, what adventure so befall me; I will not wit
 my lady to be in no jeopardy. Sir, said she, I am at your
 commandment, and shall be ready what time so ye be ready.  So on
 the morn the king and the queen departed with such fellowship as
 they had, and came into the north, into a forest beside Humber,
 and there lodged them.  When the word and tiding came unto the
 five kings above said, that Arthur was beside Humber in a forest,
 there was a knight, brother unto one of the &lt;105&gt;five kings, that
 gave them this counsel:  Ye know well that Sir Arthur hath the
 flower of chivalry of the world with him, as it is proved by the
 great battle he did with the eleven kings; and therefore hie unto
 him night and day till that we be nigh him, for the longer he
 tarrieth the bigger he is, and we ever the weaker; and he is so
 courageous of himself that he is come to the field with little
 people, and therefore let us set upon him or day and we shall
 slay down; of his knights there shall none escape.
