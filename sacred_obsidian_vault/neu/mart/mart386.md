 CHAPTER III
 
 Of an advision that Sir Launcelot had, and how he told it
 to an hermit, and desired counsel of him.
 
 
 AND so he put his horse to pasture, and did off his helm
 and his shield, and made his prayers unto the Cross that he
 never fall in deadly sin again.  And so he laid him down
 to sleep.  And anon as he was asleep it befell him there an
 advision, that there came a man afore him all by compass
 of stars, and that man had a crown of gold on his head
 and that man led in his fellowship seven kings and two
 knights.  And all these worshipped the Cross, kneeling
 upon their knees, holding up their hands toward the
 heaven.  And all they said:  Fair sweet Father of heaven
 come and visit us, and yield unto us everych as we have
 deserved.
 
 Then looked Launcelot up to the heaven, and him
 seemed the clouds did open, and an old man came down,
 with a company of angels, and alighted among them, and
 gave unto everych his blessing, and called them his
 servants, and good and true knights.  And when this old
 man had said thus he came to one of those knights, and
 said:  I have lost all that I have set in thee, for thou hast
 ruled thee against me as a warrior, and used wrong wars
 with vain-glory, more for the pleasure of the world than to
 please me, therefore thou shalt be confounded without thou
 yield me my treasure.  All this advision saw Sir Launcelot
 at the Cross.
 
 And on the morn he took his horse and rode till mid-
 day; and there by adventure he met with the same knight
 that took his horse, helm, and his sword, when he slept
 when the Sangreal appeared afore the Cross.  When Sir
 Launcelot saw him he saluted hin not fair, but cried
 on high:  Knight, keep thee, for thou hast done to me
 great unkindness.  And then they put afore them their
 spears, and Sir Launcelot came so fiercely upon him that
 he smote him and his horse down to the earth, that he had
 nigh broken his neck.  Then Sir Launcelot took the
 knight's horse that was his own aforehand, and descended
 from the horse he sat upon, and mounted upon his own
 horse, and tied the knight's own horse to a tree, that he
 might find that horse when that he was arisen.  Then Sir
 Launcelot rode till night, and by adventure he met an
 hermit, and each of them saluted other; and there he
 rested with that good man all night, and gave his horse
 such as he might get.  Then said the good man unto
 Launcelot:  Of whence be ye?  Sir, said he, I am of
 Arthur's court, and my name is Sir Launcelot du Lake
 that am in the quest of the Sangreal, and therefore I pray
 you to counsel me of a vision the which I had at the Cross.
 And so he told him all.
