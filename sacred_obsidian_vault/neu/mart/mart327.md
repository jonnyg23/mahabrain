 CHAPTER II
 
 How Sir Launcelot came to Pelles, and of the Sangreal, and
 of Elaine, King Pelles' daughter.
 
 
 SIR, said Launcelot, wit you well my name is Sir Launcelot
 du Lake.  And my name is, said the king, Pelles,
 king of the foreign country, and cousin nigh unto Joseph
 of Armathie.  And then either of them made much of
 other, and so they went into the castle to take their
 repast.  And anon there came in a dove at a window, and
 in her mouth there seemed a little censer of gold.  And
 herewithal there was such a savour as all the spicery of
 the world had been there.  And forthwithal there was
 upon the table all manner of meats and drinks that they
 could think upon.  So came in a damosel passing fair and
 young, and she bare a vessel of gold betwixt her hands;
 and thereto the king kneeled devoutly, and said his
 prayers, and so did all that were there.  O Jesu, said Sir
 Launcelot, what may this mean?  This is, said the king,
 the richest thing that any man hath living.  And when
 this thing goeth about, the Round Table shall be broken;
 and wit thou well, said the king, this is the holy Sangreal
 that ye have here seen.  So the king and Sir Launcelot
 led their life the most part of that day.  And fain would
 King Pelles have found the mean to have had Sir Launcelot
 to have lain by his daughter, fair Elaine.  And for
 this intent: the king knew well that Sir Launcelot should
 get a child upon his daughter, the which should be named
 Sir Galahad the good knight, by whom all the foreign
 country should be brought out of danger, and by him the
 Holy Greal should be achieved.
 
 Then came forth a lady that hight Dame Brisen, and
 she said unto the king:  Sir, wit ye well Sir Launcelot
 loveth no lady in the world but all only Queen Guenever;
 and therefore work ye by counsel, and I shall make him
 to lie with your daughter, and he shall not wit but that
 he lieth with Queen Guenever.  O fair lady, Dame Brisen,
 said the king, hope ye to bring this about?  Sir, said she,
 upon pain of my life let me deal; for this Brisen was one
 of the greatest enchantresses that was at that time in the
 world living.  Then anon by Dame Brisen's wit she made
 one to come to Sir Launcelot that he knew well.  And
 this man brought him a ring from Queen Guenever like
 as it had come from her, and such one as she was wont for
 the most part to wear; and when Sir Launcelot saw that
 token wit ye well he was never so fain.  Where is my
 lady? said Sir Launcelot.  In the Castle of Case, said the
 messenger, but five mile hence.  Then Sir Launcelot
 thought to be there the same might.  And then this
 Brisen by the commandment of King Pelles let send
 Elaine to this castle with twenty-five knights unto the
 Castle of Case.  Then Sir Launcelot against night rode
 unto that castle, and there anon he was received worshipfully
 with such people, to his seeming, as were about Queen
 Guenever secret.
 
 So when Sir Launcelot was alighted, he asked where
 the queen was.  So Dame Brisen said she was in her bed;
 and then the people were avoided, and Sir Launcelot was
 led unto his chamber.  And then Dame Brisen brought Sir
 Launcelot a cup full of wine; and anon as he had drunken
 that wine he was so assotted and mad that he might make
 no delay, but withouten any let he went to bed; and he
 weened that maiden Elaine had been Queen Guenever.
 Wit you well that Sir Launcelot was glad, and so was that
 lady Elaine that she had gotten Sir Launcelot in her arms.
 For well she knew that same night should be gotten upon
 her Galahad that should prove the best knight of the
 world; and so they lay together until underne of the'
 morn; and all the windows and holes of that chamber
 were stopped that no manner of day might be seen.  And
 then Sir Launcelot remembered him, and he arose up and
 went to the window.
