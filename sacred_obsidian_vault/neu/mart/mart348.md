 CHAPTER IX
 
 How Sir Bors and Sir Lionel came to King Brandegore,
 and how Sir Bors took his son Helin le Blank, and of
 Sir Launcelot.
 
 
 NOW leave we Sir Launcelot in the Joyous Isle with
 the Lady Dame Elaine, and Sir Percivale and Sir Ector
 playing with them, and turn we to Sir Bors de Ganis
 and Sir Lionel, that had sought Sir Launcelot nigh
 by the space of two year, and never could they hear
 of him.  And as they thus rode, by adventure they
 came to the house of Brandegore, and there Sir Bors
 was well known, for he had gotten a child upon the
 king's daughter fifteen year to-fore, and his name was
 Helin le Blank.  And when Sir Bors saw that child it
 liked him passing well.  And so those knights had
 good cheer of the King Brandegore.  And on the
 morn Sir Bors came afore King Brandegore and said:
 Here is my son Helin le Blank, that as it is said he
 is my son; and sith it is so, I will that ye wit that I
 will have him with me unto the court of King Arthur.
 Sir, said the king, ye may well take him with you,
 but he is over tender of age.  As for that, said Sir
 Bors, I will have him with me, and bring him to the
 house of most worship of the world.  So when Sir
 Bors should depart there was made great sorrow for
 the departing of Helin le Blank, and great weeping was
 there made.  But Sir Bors and Sir Lionel departed,
 and within a while they came to Camelot, where was
 King Arthur.  And when King Arthur understood
 that Helin le Blank was Sir Bors' son, and nephew
 unto King Brandegore, then King Arthur let him make
 knight of the Round Table; and so he proved a good
 knight and an adventurous.
 
 Now will we turn to our matter of Sir Launcelot.
 It befell upon a day Sir Ector and Sir Percivale came
 to Sir Launcelot and asked him what he would do,
 and whether he would go with them unto King Arthur
 or not.  Nay, said Sir Launcelot, that may not be by no
 mean, for I was so entreated at the court that I cast
 me never to come there more.  Sir, said Sir Ector,
 I am your brother, and ye are the man in the world
 that I love most; and if I understood that it were
 your disworship, ye may understand I would never
 counsel you thereto; but King Arthur and all his
 knights, and in especial Queen Guenever, made such
 dole and sorrow that it was marvel to hear and see.
 And ye must remember the great worship and renown
 that ye be of, how that ye have been more spoken of
 than any other knight that is now living; for there is
 none that beareth the name now but ye and Sir Tristram.
 Therefore brother, said Sir Ector, make you ready to
 ride to the court with us, and I dare say there was never
 knight better welcome to the court than ye; and I wot
 well and can make it good, said Sir Ector, it hath cost
 my lady, the queen, twenty thousand pound the seeking
 of you.  Well brother, said Sir Launcelot, I will do
 after your counsel, and ride with you.
 
 So then they took their horses and made them
 ready, and took their leave at King Pelles and at Dame
 Elaine.  And when Sir Launcelot should depart Dame
 Elaine made great sorrow.  My lord, Sir Launcelot,
 said Dame Elaine, at this same feast of Pentecost shall
 your son and mine, Galahad, be made knight, for he is
 fully now fifteen winter old.  Do as ye list, said Sir
 Launcelot; God give him grace to prove a good knight.
 As for that, said Dame Elaine, I doubt not he shall
 prove the best man of his kin except one.  Then shall he
 be a man good enough, said Sir Launcelot.
