 CHAPTER XX
 
 How it was told Sir Launcelot that Dagonet chased King
 Mark, and how a knight overthrew him and six knights.
 
 
 Now turn we again.  When Sir Ganis and Sir Brandiles
 with his fellows came to the court of King Arthur they
 told the king, Sir Launcelot, and Sir Tristram, how Sir
 Dagonet, the fool, chased King Mark through the forest,
 and how the strong knight smote them down all seven
 with one spear.  There was great laughing and japing
 at King Mark and at Sir Dagonet.  But all these knights
 could not tell what knight it was that rescued King
 Mark.  Then they asked King Mark if that he knew
 him, and he answered and said:  He named himself the
 Knight that followed the Questing Beast, and on that
 name he sent one of my varlets to a place where was his
 mother; and when she heard from whence he came she
 made passing great dole, and discovered to my varlet
 his name, and said:  Oh, my dear son, Sir Palomides,
 why wilt thou not see me?  And therefore, sir, said King
 Mark, it is to understand his name is Sir Palomides, a
 noble knight.  Then were all these seven knights glad
 that they knew his name.
 
 Now turn we again, for on the morn they took their
 horses, both Sir Lamorak, Palomides, and Dinadan, with
 their squires and varlets, till they saw a fair castle that
 stood on a mountain well closed, and thither they rode,
 and there they found a knight that hight Galahalt, that
 was lord of that castle, and there they had great cheer
 and were well eased.  Sir Dinadan, said Sir Lamorak,
 what will ye do?  Oh sir, said Dinadan, I will to-morrow
 to the court of King Arthur.  By my head, said Sir
 Palomides, I will not ride these three days, for I am sore
 hurt, and much have I bled, and therefore I will repose
 me here.  Truly, said Sir Lamorak, and I will abide here
 with you; and when ye ride, then will I ride, unless that
 ye tarry over long; then will I take my horse.  Therefore
 I pray you, Sir Dinadan, abide and ride with us.  Faithfully,
 said Dinadan, I will not abide, for I have such a
 talent to see Sir Tristram that I may not abide long
 from him.  Ah, Dinadan, said Sir Palomides, now do I
 understand that ye love my mortal enemy, and therefore
 how should I trust you.  Well, said Dinadan, I love my
 lord Sir Tristram, above all other, and him will I serve
 and do honour.  So shall I, said Sir Lamorak, in all that
 may lie in my power.
 
 So on the morn Sir Dinadan rode unto the court of
 King Arthur; and by the way as he rode he saw where
 stood an errant knight, and made him ready for to joust.
 Not so, said Dinadan, for I have no will to joust.  With
 me shall ye joust, said the knight, or that ye pass this
 way.  Whether ask ye jousts, by love or by hate? The
 knight answered: Wit ye well I ask it for love, and not
 for hate.  It may well be so, said Sir Dinadan, but ye
 proffer me hard love when ye will joust with me with a
 sharp spear.  But, fair knight, said Sir Dinadan, sith ye
 will joust with me, meet with me in the court of King
 Arthur, and there shall I joust with you.  Well, said
 the knight, sith ye will not joust with me, I pray you
 tell me your name.  Sir knight, said he, my name is Sir
 Dinadan.  Ah, said the knight, full well know I you
 for a good knight and a gentle, and wit you well I love
 you heartily.  Then shall there be no jousts, said
 Dinadan, betwixt us.  So they departed.  And the same
 day he came to Camelot, where lay King Arthur.  And
 there he saluted the king and the queen, Sir Launcelot,
 and Sir Tristram; and all the court was glad of Sir
 Dinadan, for he was gentle, wise, and courteous, and a
 good knight.  And in especial, the valiant knight Sir
 Tristram loved Sir Dinadan passing well above all other
 knights save Sir Launcelot.
 
 Then the king asked Sir Dinadan what adventures
 he had seen.  Sir, said Dinadan, I have seen many
 adventures, and of some King Mark knoweth, but not
 all.  Then the king hearkened Sir Dinadan, how he told
 that Sir Palomides and he were afore the castle of
 Morgan le Fay, and how Sir Lamorak took the jousts
 afore them, and how he forjousted twelve knights, and
 of them four he slew, and how after he smote down Sir
 Palomides and me both.  t I may not believe that, said
 the king, for Sir Palomides is a passing good knight.
 That is very truth, said Sir Dinadan, but yet I saw him
 better proved, hand for hand.  And then he told the
 king all that battle, and how Sir Palomides was more
 weaker, and more hurt, and more lost of his blood.  And
 without doubt, said Sir Dinadan, had the battle longer
 lasted, Palomides had been slain.  O Jesu, said King
 Arthur, this is to me a great marvel.  Sir, said Tristram,
 marvel ye nothing thereof, for at mine advice there is
 not a valianter knight in the world living, for I know
 his might.  And now I will say you, I was never so
 weary of knight but if it were Sir Launcelot.  And
 there is no knight in the world except Sir Launcelot that
 did so well as Sir Lamorak.  So God me help, said the
 king, I would that knight, Sir Lamorak, came to this
 Court.  Sir, said Dinadan, he will be here in short space,
 and Sir Palomides both, but I fear that Palomides may
 not yet travel.
