 CHAPTER LXXXVIII
 
 How Sir Palomides kept his day to have foughten, but Sir
 Tristram might not come; and other things.
 
 
 BUT in no wise there was no knight about Sir Tristram
 that would believe that ever Sir Palomides would hurt Sir
 Tristram, neither by his own hands nor by none other
 consenting.  Then when the fifteenth day was come, Sir
 Palomides came to the well with four knights with him
 of Arthur's court, and three sergeants-of-arms.  And for
 this intent Sir Palomides brought the knights with him
 and the sergeants-of-arms, for they should bear record of
 the battle betwixt Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides.  And
 the one sergeant brought in his helm, the other his spear,
 the third his sword.  So thus Palomides came into the
 field, and there he abode nigh two hours; and then he
 sent a squire unto Sir Tristram, and desired him to come
 into the field to hold his promise.
 
 When the squire was come to Joyous Gard, anon as
 Sir Tristram heard of his coming he let command that the
 squire should come to his presence thereas he lay in his
 bed.  My lord Sir Tristram, said Palomides' squire, wit
 you well my lord, Palomides, abideth you in the field,
 and he would wit whether ye would do battle or not.
 Ah, my fair brother, said Sir Tristram, wit thou well that
 I am right heavy for these tidings; therefore tell Sir
 Palomides an I were well at ease I would not lie here, nor
 he should have no need to send for me an I might either
 ride or go; and for thou shalt say that I am no liar--Sir
 Tristram showed him his thigh that the wound was six
 inches deep.  And now thou hast seen my hurt, tell thy
 lord that this is no feigned matter, and tell him that I had
 liefer than all the gold of King Arthur that I were whole;
 and tell Palomides as soon as I am whole I shall seek him
 endlong and overthwart, and that I promise you as I am true
 knight; and if ever I may meet with him, he shall have
 battle of me his fill.  And with this the squire departed;
 and when Palomides wist that Tristram was hurt he was
 glad and said:  Now I am sure I shall have no shame, for
 I wot well I should have had hard handling of him, and
 by likely I must needs have had the worse, for he is the
 hardest knight in battle that now is living except Sir
 Launcelot.
 
 And then departed Sir Palomides whereas fortune led
 him, and within a month Sir Tristram was whole of his
 hurt.  And then he took his horse, and rode from
 country to country, and all strange adventures he achieved
 wheresomever he rode; and always he enquired for Sir
 Palomides, but of all that quarter of summer Sir Tristram
 could never meet with Sir Palomides.  But thus as Sir
 Tristram sought and enquired after Sir Palomides Sir
 Tristram achieved many great battles, wherethrough all
 the noise fell to Sir Tristram, and it ceased of Sir
 Launcelot; and therefore Sir Launcelot's brethren and his
 kinsmen would have slain Sir Tristram because of his
 fame.  But when Sir Launcelot wist how his kinsmen
 were set, he said to them openly:  Wit you well, that an
 the envy of you all be so hardy to wait upon my lord, Sir
 Tristram, with any hurt, shame, or villainy, as I am true
 knight I shall slay the best of you with mine own hands
 Alas, fie for shame, should ye for his noble deeds await
 upon him to slay him.  Jesu defend, said Launcelot, that
 ever any noble knight as Sir Tristram is should be
 destroyed with treason.  Of this noise and fame sprang
 into Cornwall, and among them of Liones, whereof they
 were passing glad, and made great joy.  And then they
 of Liones sent letters unto Sir Tristram of recommendation,
 and many great gifts to maintain Sir Tristram's estate;
 and ever, between, Sir Tristram resorted unto Joyous Gard
 whereas La Beale Isoud was, that loved him as her life.
