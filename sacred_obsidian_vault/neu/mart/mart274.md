 CHAPTER XXXVII
 
 How Queen Morgan le Fay had Alisander in her castle, and
 how she healed his wounds.
 
 
 THEN Queen Morgan le Fay searched his wounds, and
 gave such an ointment unto him that he should have died.
 And on the morn when she came to him he complained
 him sore; and then she put other ointments upon him,
 and then he was out of his pain.  Then came the damosel
 of the castle, and said unto Morgan le Fay:  I pray you
 help me that this knight might wed me, for he hath won
 me with his hands.  Ye shall see, said Morgan le Fay,
 what I shall say.  Then Morgan le Fay went unto Alisander,
 and bade in anywise that he should refuse this lady,
 an she desire to wed you, for she is not for you.  So the
 damosel came and desired of him marriage.  Damosel, said
 Orphelin, I thank you, but as yet I cast me not to marry
 in this country.  Sir, she said, sithen ye will not marry
 me, I pray you insomuch as ye have won me, that ye will
 give me to a knight of this country that hath been my
 friend, and loved me many years.  With all my heart,
 said Alisander, I will assent thereto.  Then was the knight
 sent for, his name was Gerine le Grose.  And anon he
 made them handfast, and wedded them.
 
 Then came Queen Morgan le Fay to Alisander, and
 bade him arise, and put him in an horse litter, and gave
 him such a drink that in three days and three nights he
 waked never, but slept; and so she brought him to her
 own castle that at that time was called La Beale Regard.
 Then Morgan le Fay came to Alisander, and asked him
 if he would fain be whole.  Who would be sick, said
 Alisander, an he might be whole?  Well, said Morgan le
 Fay, then shall ye promise me by your knighthood that
 this day twelvemonth and a day ye shall not pass the
 compass of this castle, and without doubt ye shall lightly be
 whole.  I assent, said Sir Alisander.  And there he made her
 a promise: then was he soon whole.  And when Alisander
 was whole, then he repented him of his oath, for he might
 not be revenged upon King Mark.  Right so there came
 a damosel that was cousin to the Earl of Pase, and she was
 cousin to Morgan le Fay.  And by right that castle of La
 Beale Regard should have been hers by true inheritance.
 So this damosel entered into this castle where lay
 Alisander, and there she found him upon his bed, passing
 heavy and all sad.
