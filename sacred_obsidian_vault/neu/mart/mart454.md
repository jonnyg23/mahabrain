 CHAPTER XXV
 
 How true love is likened to summer.
 
 
 AND thus it passed on from Candlemass until after Easter,
 that the month of May was come, when every lusty heart
 beginneth to blossom, and to bring forth fruit; for like
 as herbs and trees bring forth fruit and flourish in May,
 in like wise every lusty heart that is in any manner a lover,
 springeth and flourisheth in lusty deeds.  For it giveth
 unto all lovers courage, that lusty month of May, in
 something to constrain him to some manner of thing
 more in that month than in any other month, for divers
 causes.  For then all herbs and trees renew a man and
 woman, and likewise lovers call again to their mind old
 gentleness and old service, and many kind deeds that
 were forgotten by negligence.  For like as winter rasure
 doth alway arase and deface green summer, so fareth it
 by unstable love in man and woman.  For in many persons
 there is no stability; for we may see all day, for a little
 blast of winter's rasure, anon we shall deface and lay apart
 true love for little or nought, that cost much thing; this
 is no wisdom nor stability, but it is feebleness of nature
 and great disworship, whosomever useth this.  Therefore,
 like as May month flowereth and flourisheth in many
 gardens, so in like wise let every man of worship flourish
 his heart in this world, first unto God, and next unto the
 joy of them that he promised his faith unto; for there
 was never worshipful man or worshipful woman, but
 they loved one better than another; and worship in arms
 may never be foiled, but first reserve the honour to God,
 and secondly the quarrel must come of thy lady: and
 such love I call virtuous love.
 
 But nowadays men can not love seven night but they
 must have all their desires: that love may not endure by
 reason; for where they be soon accorded and hasty heat,
 soon it cooleth.  Right so fareth love nowadays, soon hot
 soon cold: this is no stability.  But the old love was not
 so; men and women could love together seven years, and
 no licours lusts were between them, and then was love,
 truth, and faithfulness: and lo, in like wise was used love
 in King Arthur's days.  Wherefore I liken love nowadays
 unto summer and winter; for like as the one is hot and the
 other cold, so fareth love nowadays; therefore all ye that
 be lovers call unto your remembrance the month of May,
 like as did Queen Guenever, for whom I make here a little
 mention, that while she lived she was a true lover, and
 therefore she had a good end.
