 CHAPTER LX
 
 How Sir Tristram with his fellowship came and were with
 an host which after fought with Sir Tristram; and
 other matters.
 
 
 THEN departed Sir Tristram, Gareth, and Sir Dinadan,
 and left Sir Palomides in the vessel; and so Sir Tristram
 beheld the mariners how they sailed overlong Humber.
 And when Sir Palomides was out of their sight they took
 their horses and beheld about them.  And then were they
 ware of a knight that came riding against them unarmed,
 and nothing about him but a sword.  And when this
 knight came nigh them he saluted them, and they him
 again.  Fair knights, said that knight, I pray you insomuch
 as ye be knights errant, that ye will come and see
 my castle, and take such as ye find there; I pray you
 heartily.  And so they rode with him until his castle, and
 there they were brought into the hall, that was well
 apparelled; and so they were there unarmed, and set at a
 board; and when this knight saw Sir Tristram, anon he
 knew him.  And then this knight waxed pale and wroth
 at Sir Tristram.  When Sir Tristram saw his host make
 such cheer he marvelled and said:  Sir, mine host, what
 cheer make you?  Wit thou well, said he, I fare the
 worse for thee, for I know thee, Sir Tristram de Liones,
 thou slewest my brother; and therefore I give thee
 summons I will slay thee an ever I may get thee at
 large.  Sir knight, said Sir Tristram, I am never advised
 that ever I slew any brother of yours; and if ye say that
 I did I will make amends unto my power.  I will none
 amends, said the knight, but keep thee from me.
 
 So when he had dined Sir Tristram asked his arms,
 and departed.  And so they rode on their ways, and
 within a while Sir Dinadan saw where came a knight well
 armed and well horsed, without shield.  Sir Tristram,
 said Sir Dinadan, take keep to yourself, for I dare undertake
 yonder cometh your host that will have ado with
 you.  Let him come, said Sir Tristram, I shall abide
 him as well as I may.  Anon the knight, when he came
 nigh Sir Tristram, he cried and bade him abide and keep
 him.  So they hurtled together, but Sir Tristram smote
 the other knight so sore that he bare him over his horse's
 croup.  That knight arose lightly and took his horse
 again, and so rode fiercely to Sir Tristram, and smote him
 twice hard upon the helm.  Sir knight, said Sir Tristram,
 I pray you leave off and smite me no more, for I would
 be loath to deal with you an I might choose, for I have
 your meat and your drink within my body.  For all that
 he would not leave; and then Sir Tristram gave him
 such a buffet upon the helm that he fell up-so-down from
 his horse, that the blood brast out at the ventails of his
 helm, and so he lay still likely to be dead.  Then Sir
 Tristram said:  Me repenteth of this buffet that I smote
 so sore, for as I suppose he is dead.  And so they left
 him and rode on their ways.
 
 So they had not ridden but a while, but they saw
 riding against them two full likely knights, well armed
 and well horsed, and goodly servants about them.  The
 one was Berrant le Apres, and he was called the King
 with the Hundred Knights; and the other was Sir
 Segwarides, which were renowned two noble knights.  So
 as they came either by other the king looked upon Sir
 Dinadan, that at that time he had Sir Tristram's helm
 upon his shoulder, the which helm the king had seen
 to-fore with the Queen of Northgalis, and that queen the
 king loved as paramour; and that helm the Queen of
 Northgalis had given to La Beale Isoud, and the queen
 La Beale Isoud gave it to Sir Tristram.  Sir knight, said
 Berrant, where had ye that helm?  What would ye? said
 Sir Dinadan.  For I will have ado with thee, said the
 king, for the love of her that owed that helm, and
 therefore keep you.  So they departed and came together with
 all their mights of their horses, and there the King with
 the Hundred Knights smote Sir Dinadan, horse and all,
 to the earth; and then he commanded his servant:  Go
 and take thou his helm off, and keep it.  So the varlet
 went to unbuckle his helm.  What helm, what wilt thou
 do? said Sir Tristram, leave that helm.  To what intent,
 said the king, will ye, sir knight, meddle with that helm?
 Wit you well, said Sir Tristram, that helm shall not depart
 from me or it be dearer bought.  Then make you ready,
 said Sir Berrant unto Sir Tristram.  So they hurtled
 together, and there Sir Tristram smote him down over his
 horse's tail; and then the king arose lightly, and gat his
 horse lightly again.  And then he struck fiercely at Sir
 Tristram many great strokes.  And then Sir Tristram
 gave Sir Berrant such a buffet upon the helm that he fell
 down over his horse sore stonied.  Lo, said Dinadan, that
 helm is unhappy to us twain, for I had a fall for it, and
 now, sir king, have ye another fall.
 
 Then Segwarides asked:  Who shall joust with me?
 I pray thee, said Sir Gareth unto Dinadan, let me have
 this jousts.  Sir, said Dinadan, I pray you take it as for me.
 That is no reason, said Tristram, for this jousts should
 be yours.  At a word, said Dinadan, I will not thereof.
 Then Gareth dressed him to Sir Segwarides, and there Sir
 Segwarides smote Gareth and his horse to the earth.
 Now, said Sir Tristram to Dinadan, joust with yonder
 knight.  I will not thereof, said Dinadan.  Then will I,
 said Sir Tristram.  And then Sir Tristram ran to him,
 and gave him a fall; and so they left them on foot, and
 Sir Tristram rode unto Joyous Gard, and there Sir Gareth
 would not of his courtesy have gone into this castle, but
 Sir Tristram would not suffer him to depart.  And so
 they alighted and unarmed them, and had great cheer.
 But when Dinadan came afore La Beale Isoud he cursed
 the time that ever he bare Sir Tristram's helm, and there
 he told her how Sir Tristram had mocked him.  Then
 was there laughing and japing at Sir Dinadan, that they
 wist not what to do with him.
