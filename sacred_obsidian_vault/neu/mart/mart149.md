 CHAPTER XXXI
 
 How Sir Gareth came to a castle where he was well lodged,
 and he jousted with a knight and slew him.
 
 THEN Sir Gareth rode unto the barbican of the castle, and prayed
 the porter fair to let him into the castle.  The porter answered
 ungoodly again, and said, Thou gettest no lodging here.  Fair
 sir, say not so, for I am a knight of King Arthur's, and pray the
 lord or the lady of this castle to give me harbour for the love
 of King Arthur.  Then the porter went unto the duchess, and told
 her how there was a knight of King Arthur's would have harbour. 
 Let him in, said the duchess, for I will see that knight, and for
 King Arthur's sake he shall not be harbourless.  Then she yode up
 into a tower over the gate, with great torchlight.
 
 When Sir Gareth saw that torch-light he cried on high:  Whether
 thou be lord or lady, giant or champion, I take no force so that
 I may have harbour this night; and if it so be that I must needs
 fight, spare me not to-morn when I have rested me, for both I and
 mine horse be weary.  Sir knight, said the lady, thou speakest
 knightly and boldly; but wit thou well the lord of this castle
 loveth not King Arthur, nor none of his court, for my lord hath
 ever been against him; and therefore thou were better not to come
 within this castle; for an thou come in this night, thou must
 come in under such form, that wheresomever &lt;268&gt;thou meet my
 lord, by stigh or by street, thou must yield thee to him as
 prisoner.  Madam, said Sir Gareth, what is your lord, and what is
 his name?  Sir, my lord's name is the Duke de la Rowse.  Well
 madam, said Sir Gareth, I shall promise you in what place I meet
 your lord I shall yield me unto him and to his good grace; with
 that I understand he will do me no harm: and if I understand that
 he will, I will release myself an I can with my spear and my
 sword.  Ye say well, said the duchess; and then she let the
 drawbridge down, and so he rode into the hall, and there he
 alighted, and his horse was led into a stable; and in the hall he
 unarmed him and said, Madam, I will not out of this hall this
 night; and when it is daylight, let see who will have ado with
 me, he shall find me ready.  Then was he set unto supper, and had
 many good dishes.  Then Sir Gareth list well to eat, and knightly
 he ate his meat, and eagerly; there was many a fair lady by him,
 and some said they never saw a goodlier man nor so well of
 eating.  Then they made him passing good cheer, and shortly when
 he had supped his bed was made there; so he rested him all night.
 
 And on the morn he heard mass, and brake his fast and took his
 leave at the duchess, and at them all; and thanked her goodly of
 her lodging, and of his good cheer; and then she asked him his
 name.  Madam, he said, truly my name is Gareth of Orkney, and
 some men call me Beaumains.  Then knew she well it was the same
 knight that fought for Dame Lionesse.  So Sir Gareth departed and
 rode up into a mountain, and there met him a knight, his name was
 Sir Bendelaine, and said to Sir Gareth:  Thou shalt not pass this
 way, for either thou shalt joust with me, or else be my prisoner. 
 Then will I joust, said Sir Gareth.  And so they let their horses
 run, and there Sir Gareth smote him throughout the body; and Sir
 Bendelaine rode forth to his castle there beside, and there died. 
 So Sir Gareth would have rested him, and he came riding to
 Bendelaine's castle.  Then his knights and servants espied that
 it was he that had slain their lord.  Then they armed twenty good
 men, and &lt;269&gt;came out and assailed Sir Gareth; and so he had no
 spear, but his sword, and put his shield afore him; and there
 they brake their spears upon him, and they assailed him passingly
 sore.  But ever Sir Gareth defended him as a knight.
