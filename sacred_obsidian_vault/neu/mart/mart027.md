 CHAPTER I
 
 Of a damosel which came girt with a sword for to find a
 man of such virtue to draw it out of the scabbard.
 
 AFTER the death of Uther Pendragon reigned Arthur his son, the
 which had great war in his days for to get all England into his
 hand.  For there were many kings within the realm of England, and
 in Wales, Scotland, and Cornwall.  So it befell on a time when
 King Arthur was at London, there came a knight and told the king
 tidings how that the King Rience of North Wales had reared a
 great number of people, and were entered into the land, and burnt
 and slew the king's true liege people.  If this be true, said
 Arthur, it were great shame unto mine estate but that he were
 mightily withstood.  It is truth, said the knight, for I saw the
 host myself.  Well, said the king, let make a cry, that all the
 lords, knights, and gentlemen of arms, should draw unto a castle
 called Camelot in those days, and there the king would let make a
 council-general and a great jousts.
 
 So when the king was come thither with all his baronage, and
 lodged as they seemed best, there was come a damosel the which
 was sent on message from the great lady Lile of Avelion.  And
 when she came before King Arthur, she told from whom she came,
 and how she was sent on message unto him for these causes.  Then
 she let her mantle fall that was richly furred; and then was she
 girt with a noble sword whereof the king had marvel, and
 &lt;50&gt;said, Damosel, for what cause are ye girt with that sword? it
 beseemeth you not.  Now shall I tell you, said the damosel; this
 sword that I am girt withal doth me great sorrow and cumbrance,
 for I may not be delivered of this sword but by a knight, but he
 must be a passing good man of his hands and of his deeds, and
 without villainy or treachery, and without treason.  And if I may
 find such a knight that hath all these virtues, he may draw out
 this sword out of the sheath, for I have been at King Rience's it
 was told me there were passing good knights, and he and all his
 knights have assayed it and none can speed.  This is a great
 marvel, said Arthur, if this be sooth; I will myself assay to
 draw out the sword, not presuming upon myself that I am the best
 knight, but that I will begin to draw at your sword in giving
 example to all the barons that they shall assay everych one after
 other when I have assayed it.  Then Arthur took the sword by the
 sheath and by the girdle and pulled at it eagerly, but the sword
 would not out.
 
 Sir, said the damosel, you need not to pull half so hard, for he
 that shall pull it out shall do it with little might.  Ye say
 well, said Arthur; now assay ye all my barons; but beware ye be
 not defiled with shame, treachery, nor guile.  Then it will not
 avail, said the damosel, for he must be a clean knight without
 villainy, and of a gentle strain of father side and mother side. 
 Most of all the barons of the Round Table that were there at that
 time assayed all by row, but there might none speed; wherefore
 the damosel made great sorrow out of measure, and said, Alas! I
 weened in this court had been the best knights without treachery
 or treason.  By my faith, said Arthur, here are good knights, as
 I deem, as any be in the world, but their grace is not to help
 you, wherefore I am displeased.
