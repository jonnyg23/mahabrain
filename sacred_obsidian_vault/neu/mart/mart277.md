 CHAPTER XL
 
 How Sir Galahalt did do cry a jousts in Surluse, and Queen
 Guenever's knights should joust against all that would
 come.
 
 
 BUT as the book saith, King Mark would never stint till
 he had slain him by treason.  And by Alice he gat a child
 that hight Bellengerus le Beuse.  And by good fortune he
 came to the court of King Arthur, and proved a passing
 good knight; and he revenged his father's death, for the
 false King Mark slew both Sir Tristram and Alisander
 falsely and feloniously.  And it happed so that Alisander
 had never grace nor fortune to come to King Arthur's
 court.  For an he had come to Sir Launcelot, all knights
 said that knew him, he was one of the strongest knights
 that was in Arthur's days, and great dole was made for
 him.  So let we of him pass, and turn we to another tale.
 
 So it befell that Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, was
 lord of the country of Surluse, whereof came many good
 knights.  And this noble prince was a passing good man
 of arms, and ever he held a noble fellowship together.
 And then he came to Arthur's court and told him his
 intent, how this was his will, how he would let cry a
 jousts in the country of Surluse, the which country was
 within the lands of King Arthur, and there he asked leave
 to let cry a jousts.  I will give you leave, said King Arthur;
 but wit thou well, said King Arthur, I may not be there.
 Sir, said Queen Guenever, please it you to give me leave
 to be at that jousts.  With right good will, said Arthur;
 for Sir Galahalt, the haut prince, shall have you in
 governance.  Sir, said Galahalt, I will as ye will.  Sir,
 then the queen, I will take with me [Sir Launcelot] and
 such knights as please me best.  Do as ye list, said King
 Arthur.  So anon she commanded Sir Launcelot to make
 him ready with such knights as he thought best.
 
 So in every good town and castle of this land was
 made a cry, that in the country of Surluse Sir Galahalt
 should make a joust that should last eight days, and how
 the haut prince, with the help of Queen Guenever's
 knights, should joust against all manner of men that
 would come.  When this cry was known, kings and
 princes, dukes and earls, barons and noble knights, made
 them ready to be at that jousts.  And at the day of
 jousting there came in Sir Dinadan disguised, and did
 many great deeds of arms.
