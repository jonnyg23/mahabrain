 CHAPTER XII
 
 How eleven kings gathered a great host against
 King Arthur.
 
 
 AND SO within a little space the three kings came unto the castle
 of Bedegraine, and found there a passing fair fellowship, and
 well beseen, whereof they had great joy, and victual they wanted
 none.  This was the cause of the northern host: that they were
 reared for the despite and rebuke the six kings had at Carlion. 
 And those six kings by their means, gat unto them five other
 kings; and thus they began to gather their people.
 
 And now they sware that for weal nor woe, they should not leave
 other, till they had destroyed Arthur.  And then they made an
 oath.  The first that began the oath was the Duke of Cambenet,
 that he would bring with him five thousand men of arms, the which
 were ready on horseback.  Then sware King Brandegoris of
 Stranggore that he would bring five thousand men of arms on
 horseback.  Then sware King Clariance of Northumberland he would
 bring three thousand men of arms.  Then sware the King of the &lt;21
 CHAP. XIII  OF A DREAM&gt;Hundred Knights, that was a passing good
 man and a young, that he would bring four thousand men of arms on
 horseback.  Then there swore King Lot, a passing good knight, and
 Sir Gawain's father, that he would bring five thousand men of
 arms on horseback.  Also there swore King Urience, that was Sir
 Uwain's father, of the land of Gore, and he would bring six
 thousand men of arms on horseback.  Also there swore King Idres
 of Cornwall, that he would bring five thousand men of arms on
 horseback.  Also there swore King Cradelmas to bring five
 thousand men on horseback.  Also there swore King Agwisance of
 Ireland to bring five thousand men of arms on horseback.  Also
 there swore King Nentres to bring five thousand men of arms on
 horseback.  Also there swore King Carados to bring five thousand
 men of arms on horseback.  So their whole host was of clean men
 of arms on horseback fifty thousand, and a-foot ten thousand of
 good men's bodies.  Then were they soon ready, and mounted upon
 horse and sent forth their fore-riders, for these eleven kings in
 their ways laid a siege unto the castle of Bedegraine; and so
 they departed and drew toward Arthur, and left few to abide at
 the siege, for the castle of Bedegraine was holden of King
 Arthur, and the men that were therein were Arthur's.
