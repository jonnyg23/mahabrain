 CHAPTER LXXXV
 
 How Sir Tristram made him ready to rescue Sir Palomides,
 but Sir Launcelot rescued him or he came.
 
 
 WHEN Sir Tristram heard how Sir Palomides went to his
 death, he was heavy to hear that, and said:  Howbeit that
 I am wroth with Sir Palomides, yet will not I suffer him to
 die so shameful a death, for he is a full noble knight.  And
 then anon Sir Tristram was armed and took his horse and
 two squires with him, and rode a great pace toward the
 castle of Pelownes where Sir Palomides was judged to death.
 And these twelve knights that led Sir Palomides passed by
 a well whereas Sir Launcelot was, which was alighted there,
 and had tied his horse to a tree, and taken off his helm
 to drink of that well; and when he saw these knights, Sir
 Launcelot put on his helm and suffered them to pass by
 him.  And then was he ware of Sir Palomides bounden,
 and led shamefully to his death.  O Jesu, said Launcelot,
 what misadventure is befallen him that he is thus led
 toward his death?  Forsooth, said Launcelot, it were shame
 to me to suffer this noble knight so to die an I might help
 him, therefore I will help him whatsomever come of it,
 or else I shall die for Sir Palomides' sake.  And then Sir
 Launcelot mounted upon his horse, and gat his spear in
 his hand, and rode after the twelve knights that led Sir
 Palomides.  Fair knights, said Sir Launcelot, whither lead
 ye that knight? it beseemeth him full ill to ride bounden.
 Then these twelve knights suddenly turned their horses
 and said to Sir Launcelot:  Sir knight, we counsel thee not
 to meddle with this knight, for he hath deserved death, and
 unto death he is judged.  That me repenteth, said Launcelot,
 that I may not borrow him with fairness, for he is over
 good a knight to die such a shameful death.  And therefore,
 fair knights, said Sir Launcelot, keep you as well as
 ye can, for I will rescue that knight or die for it.
 
 Then they began to dress their spears, and Sir Launcelot
 smote the foremost down, horse and man, and so he served
 three more with one spear; and then that spear brast, and
 therewithal Sir Launcelot drew his sword, and then he
 smote on the right hand and on the left hand.  Then
 within a while he left none of those twelve knights, but he
 had laid them to the earth, and the most part of them
 were sore wounded.  And then Sir Launcelot took the
 best horse that he found, and loosed Sir Palomides and set
 him upon that horse; and so they returned again unto
 Joyous Gard, and then was Sir Palomides ware of Sir
 Tristram how he came riding.  And when Sir Launcelot
 saw him he knew him well, but Sir Tristram knew him not
 because Sir Launcelot had on his shoulder a golden shield.
 So Sir Launcelot made him ready to joust with Sir Tristram,
 that Sir Tristram should not ween that he were Sir
 Launcelot.  Then Sir Palomides cried aloud to Sir Tristram:
 O my lord, I require you joust not with this knight, for
 this good knight hath saved me from my death.  When
 Sir Tristram heard him say so he came a soft trotting pace
 toward them.  And then Sir Palomides said:  My lord,
 Sir Tristram, much am I beholding unto you of your great
 goodness, that would proffer your noble body to rescue me
 undeserved, for I have greatly offended you.  Notwithstanding,
 said Sir Palomides, here met we with this noble
 knight that worshipfully and manly rescued me from twelve
 knights, and smote them down all and wounded them sore.
