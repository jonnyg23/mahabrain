 CHAPTER XXXIV
 
 How Anglides gave the bloody doublet to Alisander, her son,
 the same day that he was made knight, and the charge
 withal.
 
 
 THEN upon a day Bellangere the Constable came to
 Anglides and said:  Madam, it were time my lord Alisander
 were made knight, for he is a passing strong
 young man.  Sir, said she, I would he were made knight;
 but then must I give him the most charge that ever
 sinful mother gave to her child.  Do as ye list, said
 Bellangere, and I shall give him warning that he shall be
 made knight.  Now it will be well done that he may be
 made knight at our Lady Day in Lent.  Be it so, said
 Anglides, and I pray you make ready therefore.  So came
 the Constable to Alisander, and told him that he should
 at our Lady Day in Lent be made knight.  I thank God,
 said Alisander; these are the best tidings that ever came
 to me.  Then the Constable ordained twenty of the
 greatest gentlemen's sons, and the best born men of the
 country, that should be made knights that same day that
 Alisander was made knight.  So on the same day that
 Alisander and his twenty fellows were made knights, at
 the offering of the mass there came Anglides unto her
 son and said thus:  O fair sweet son, I charge thee upon
 my blessing, and of the high order of chivalry that thou
 takest here this day, that thou understand what I shall
 say and charge thee withal.  Therewithal she pulled out a
 bloody doublet and a bloody shirt, that were be-bled with
 old blood.  When Alisander saw this he stert aback and
 waxed pale, and said:  Fair mother, what may this mean?
 I shall tell thee, fair son: this was thine own father's
 doublet and shirt, that he wore upon him that same day
 that he was slain.  And there she told him why and
 wherefore, and how for his goodness King Mark slew
 him with his dagger afore mine own eyen.  And therefore
 this shall be your charge that I shall give thee.
