 CHAPTER XXXVII
 
 How Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan
 were taken and put in prison.
 
 NOW will we speak of Sir Lucan the butler, that by fortune he
 came riding to the same place thereas was Sir Tristram, and in he
 came in none other intent but to ask harbour.  Then the porter
 asked what was his name. Tell your lord that my name is Sir
 Lucan, the butler, a &lt;418&gt;Knight of the Round Table.  So the
 porter went unto Sir Darras, lord of the place, and told him who
 was there to ask harbour.  Nay, nay, said Sir Daname, that was
 nephew to Sir Darras, say him that he shall not be lodged here,
 but let him wit that I, Sir Daname, will meet with him anon, and
 bid him make him ready.  So Sir Daname came forth on horseback,
 and there they met together with spears, and Sir Lucan smote down
 Sir Daname over his horse's croup, and then he fled into that
 place, and Sir Lucan rode after him, and asked after him many
 times.
 
 Then Sir Dinadan said to Sir Tristram:  It is shame to see the
 lord's cousin of this place defoiled.  Abide, said Sir Tristram,
 and I shall redress it.  And in the meanwhile Sir Dinadan was on
 horseback, and he jousted with Lucan the butler, and there Sir
 Lucan smote Dinadan through the thick of the thigh, and so he
 rode his way; and Sir Tristram was wroth that Sir Dinadan was
 hurt, and followed after, and thought to avenge him; and within a
 while he overtook Sir Lucan, and bade him turn; and so they met
 together so that Sir Tristram hurt Sir Lucan passing sore and
 gave him a fall.  With that came Sir Uwaine, a gentle knight, and
 when he saw Sir Lucan so hurt he called Sir Tristram to joust
 with him.  Fair knight, said Sir Tristram, tell me your name I
 require you.  Sir knight, wit ye well my name is Sir Uwaine le
 Fise de Roy Ureine.  Ah, said Sir Tristram, by my will I would
 not have ado with you at no time.  Ye shall not so, said Sir
 Uwaine, but ye shall have ado with me.  And then Sir Tristram saw
 none other bote, but rode against him, and overthrew Sir Uwaine
 and hurt him in the side, and so he departed unto his lodging
 again.  And when Sir Dinadan understood that Sir Tristram had
 hurt Sir Lucan he would have ridden after Sir Lucan for to have
 slain him, but Sir Tristram would not suffer him.  Then Sir
 Uwaine let ordain an horse litter, and brought Sir Lucan to the
 abbey of Ganis, and the castle thereby hight the Castle of Ganis,
 of the which Sir Bleoberis was lord.  And at that castle Sir
 Launcelot promised all his fellows to meet in the quest of Sir
 Tristram.
 
 &lt;419&gt;
 So when Sir Tristram was come to his lodging there came a damosel
 that told Sir Darras that three of his sons were slain at that
 tournament, and two grievously wounded that they were never like
 to help themself.  And all this was done by a noble knight that
 bare the black shield, and that was he that bare the prize.  Then
 came there one and told Sir Darras that the same knight was
 within, him that bare the black shield.  Then Sir Darras yede
 unto Sir Tristram's chamber, and there he found his shield and
 showed it to the damosel.  Ah sir, said the damosel, that same is
 he that slew your three sons.  Then without any tarrying Sir
 Darras put Sir Tristram, and Sir Palomides, and Sir Dinadan,
 within a strong prison, and there Sir Tristram was like to have
 died of great sickness; and every day Sir Palomides would reprove
 Sir Tristram of old hate betwixt them.  And ever Sir Tristram
 spake fair and said little.  But when Sir Palomides saw the
 falling of sickness of Sir Tristram, then was he heavy for him,
 and comforted him in all the best wise he could.  And as the
 French book saith, there came forty knights to Sir Darras that
 were of his own kin, and they would have slain Sir Tristram and
 his two fellows, but Sir Darras would not suffer that, but kept
 them in prison, and meat and drink they had.  So Sir Tristram
 endured there great pain, for sickness had undertaken him, and
 that is the greatest pain a prisoner may have.  For all the while
 a prisoner may have his health of body he may endure under the
 mercy of God and in hope of good deliverance; but when sickness
 toucheth a prisoner's body, then may a prisoner say all wealth is
 him bereft, and then he hath cause to wail and to weep.  Right so
 did Sir Tristram when sickness had undertaken him, for then he
 took such sorrow that he had almost slain himself.
