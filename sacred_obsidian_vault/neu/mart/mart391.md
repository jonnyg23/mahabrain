 CHAPTER II
 
 Of the advision of Sir Ector, and how he jousted with Sir
 Uwaine les Avoutres, his sworn brother.
 
 
 BUT to Ector de Maris befell another vision the contrary.
 For it seemed him that his brother, Sir Launcelot, and
 he alighted out of a chair and leapt upon two horses,
 and the one said to the other:  Go we seek that we shall
 not find.  And him thought that a man beat Sir Launcelot,
 and despoiled him, and clothed him in another array,
 the which was all full of knots, and set him upon an ass,
 and so he rode till he came to the fairest well that ever he
 saw; and Sir Launcelot alighted and would have drunk
 of that well.  And when he stooped to drink of the water
 the water sank from him.  And when Sir Launcelot saw
 that, he turned and went thither as the head came from.
 And in the meanwhile he trowed that himself and Sir
 Ector rode till that they came to a rich man's house
 where there was a wedding.  And there he saw a king the
 which said:  Sir knight, here is no place for you.  And
 then he turned again unto the chair that he came from.
 
 Thus within a while both Gawaine and Ector awaked,
 and either told other of their advision, the which marvelled
 them greatly.  Truly, said Ector, I shall never be merry
 till I hear tidings of my brother Launcelot.  Now as they
 sat thus talking they saw an hand showing unto the elbow,
 and was covered with red samite, and upon that hung a
 bridle not right rich, and held within the fist a great
 candle which burned right clear, and so passed afore them,
 and entered into the chapel, and then vanished away and
 they wist not where.  And anon came down a voice which
 said:  Knights of full evil faith and of poor belief, these
 two things have failed you, and therefore ye may not come
 to the adventures of the Sangreal.
 
 Then first spake Gawaine and said:  Ector, have ye
 heard these words?  Yea truly, said Sir Ector, I heard
 all.  Now go we, said Sir Ector, unto some hermit that
 will tell us of our advision, for it seemeth me we labour
 all in vain.  And so they departed and rode into a valley,
 and there met with a squire which rode on an hackney,
 and they saluted him fair.  Sir, said Gawaine, can thou
 teach us to any hermit?  Here is one in a little mountain,
 but it is so rough there may no horse go thither, and
 therefore ye must go upon foot; there shall ye find a poor
 house, and there is Nacien the hermit, which is the holiest
 man in this country.  And so they departed either from
 other.
 
 And then in a valley they met with a knight all armed,
 which proffered them to joust as far as he saw them.  In
 the name of God, said Sir Gawaine, sith I departed from
 Camelot there was none proffered me to joust but once.
 And now, sir, said Ector, let me joust with him.  Nay,
 said Gawaine, ye shall not but if I be beat; it shall not
 for-think me then if ye go after me.  And then either
 embraced other to joust and came together as fast as their
 horses might run, and brast their shields and the mails,
 and the one more than the other; and Gawaine was
 wounded in the left side, but the other knight was smitten
 through the breast, and the spear came out on the other
 side, and so they fell both out of their saddles, and in the
 falling they brake both their spears.
 
 Anon Gawaine arose and set his hand to his sword,
 and cast his shield afore him.  But all for naught was it,
 for the knight had no power to arise against him.  Then
 said Gawaine: Ye must yield you as an overcome man, or
 else I may slay you.  Ah, sir knight, said he, I am but
 dead, for God's sake and of your gentleness lead me here
 unto an abbey that I may receive my Creator.  Sir, said
 Gawaine, I know no house of religion hereby.  Sir, said
 the knight, set me on an horse to-fore you, and I shall
 teach you.  Gawaine set him up in the saddle, and he
 leapt up behind him for to sustain him, and so came to
 an abbey where they were well received; and anon he
 was unarmed, and received his Creator.  Then he prayed
 Gawaine to draw out the truncheon of the spear out of his
 body.  Then Gawaine asked him what he was, that knew
 him not.  I am, said he, of King Arthur's court, and was
 a fellow of the Round Table, and we were brethren sworn
 together; and now Sir Gawaine, thou hast slain me, and
 my name is Uwaine les Avoutres, that sometime was son
 unto King Uriens, and was in the quest of the Sangreal;
 and now forgive it thee God, for it shall ever be said that
 the one sworn brother hath slain the other.
