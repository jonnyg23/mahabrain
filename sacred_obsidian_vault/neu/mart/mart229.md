 CHAPTER XXXVI
 
 How Palomides came to the castle where Sir Tristram was,
 and of the quest that Sir Launcelot and ten knights made
 for Sir Tristram.
 
 AND when he came to the land he took off his harness, and sat
 roaring and crying as a man out of his mind.  Right so came a
 damosel even by Sir Palomides, that was sent from Sir Gawaine and
 his brother unto Sir Mordred, that lay sick in the same place
 with that old knight where Sir Tristram was.  For, as the French
 book saith, Sir Persides hurt so Sir Mordred a ten days afore;
 and had it hot been for the love of Sir Gawaine and his brother,
 Sir Persides had slain Sir Mordred.  And so this damosel came by
 Sir Palomides, and she and he had language together, the which
 pleased neither of them; and so the damosel rode her ways till
 she came to the old knight's place, and there she told that old
 knight how she met with the woodest knight by adventure that ever
 she met withal.  What bare he in his shield? said Sir Tristram. 
 It was indented with white and black, said &lt;416&gt;the damosel.  Ah,
 said Sir Tristram, that was Sir Palomides, the good knight.  For
 well I know him, said Sir Tristram, for one of the best knights
 living in this realm.  Then that old knight took a little
 hackney, and rode for Sir Palomides, and brought him unto his own
 manor; and full well knew Sir Tristram Sir Palomides, but he said
 but little, for at that time Sir Tristram was walking upon his
 feet, and well amended of his hurts; and always when Sir
 Palomides saw Sir Tristram he would behold him full marvellously,
 and ever him seemed that he had seen him.  Then would he say unto
 Sir Dinadan:  An ever I may meet with Sir Tristram he shall not
 escape mine hands.  I marvel, said Sir Dinadan, that ye boast
 behind Sir Tristram, for it is but late that he was in your
 hands, and ye in his hands; why would ye not hold him when ye had
 him? for I saw myself twice or thrice that ye gat but little
 worship of Sir Tristram.  Then was Sir Palomides ashamed.  So
 leave we them a little while in the old castle with the old
 knight Sir Darras.
 
 Now shall we speak of King Arthur, that said to Sir Launcelot: 
 Had not ye been we had not lost Sir Tristram, for he was here
 daily unto the time ye met with him, and in an evil time, said
 Arthur, ye encountered with him.  My lord Arthur, said Launcelot,
 ye put upon me that I should be cause of his departition; God
 knoweth it was against my will.  But when men be hot in deeds of
 arms oft they hurt their friends as well as their foes.  And my
 lord, said Sir Launcelot, ye shall understand that Sir Tristram
 is a man that I am loath to offend, for he hath done for me more
 than ever I did for him as yet.  But then Sir Launcelot made
 bring forth a book: and then Sir Launcelot said:  Here we are ten
 knights that will swear upon a book never to rest one night where
 we rest another this twelvemonth until that we find Sir Tristram. 
 And as for me, said Sir Launcelot, I promise you upon this book
 that an I may meet with him, either with fairness or foulness I
 shall bring him to this court, or else I shall die therefore. 
 And the names of these &lt;417&gt;ten knights that had undertaken this
 quest were these following:  First was Sir Launcelot, Sir Ector
 de Maris, Sir Bors de Ganis, and Bleoberis, and Sir Blamore de
 Ganis, and Lucan the Butler, Sir Uwaine, Sir Galihud Lionel, and
 Galiodin.  So these ten noble knights departed from the court of
 King Arthur, and so they rode upon their quest together until
 they came to a cross where departed four ways, and there departed
 the fellowship in four to seek Sir Tristram.
 
 And as Sir Launcelot rode by adventure he met with Dame Bragwaine
 that was sent into that country to seek Sir Tristram, and she
 fled as fast as her palfrey might go.  So Sir Launcelot met with
 her and asked her why she fled.  Ah, fair knight, said Dame
 Bragwaine, I flee for dread of my life, for here followeth me Sir
 Breuse Saunce Pite to slay me.  Hold you nigh me, said Sir
 Launcelot.  Then when Sir Launcelot saw Sir Breuse Saunce Pite,
 Sir Launcelot cried unto him, and said:  False knight destroyer
 of ladies and damosels, now thy last days be come.  When Sir
 Breuse Saunce Pite saw Sir Launcelot's shield he knew it well,
 for at that time he bare not the arms of Cornwall, but he bare
 his own shield.  And then Sir Breuse fled, and Sir Launcelot
 followed after him.  But Sir Breuse was so well horsed that when
 him list to flee he might well flee, and also abide when him
 list.  And then Sir Launcelot returned unto Dame Bragwaine, and
 she thanked him of his great labour.
