 CHAPTER II
 
 How Balin, arrayed like a poor knight, pulled out the sword,
 which afterward was the cause of his death.
 
 THEN fell it so that time there was a poor knight with King
 Arthur, that had been prisoner with him half a year and more for
 slaying of a knight, the which was cousin unto King Arthur.  The
 name of this knight was called Balin, and by good means of the
 barons he was delivered out of prison, for he was a good man
 named of his body, and he was born in Northumberland.  And so he
 went privily into the court, and saw this adventure, whereof it
 raised his heart, and he would assay it as other knights did, but
 for he was poor and poorly arrayed he put him not far in press. 
 But in his heart he was fully assured to do as well, if his grace
 happed him, as any knight that there was.  And as the damosel
 took her leave of Arthur and of all the barons, so departing,
 this knight Balin called unto her, and said, Damosel, I pray you
 of your courtesy, suffer me as well to assay as these lords;
 though that I be so poorly clothed, in my heart meseemeth I am
 fully assured as some of these others, and meseemeth in my heart
 to speed right well.  The damosel beheld the poor knight, and saw
 he was a likely man, but for his poor arrayment she thought he
 should be of no worship without villainy or treachery.  And then
 she said unto the knight, Sir, it needeth not to put me to more
 pain or labour, for it seemeth not you to speed there as other
 have failed.  Ah! fair damosel, said Balin, worthiness, and good
 tatches, and good deeds, are not only in arrayment, but manhood
 and worship is hid within man's person, and many a worshipful
 knight is not known unto all people, and therefore worship and
 hardiness is not in arrayment.  By God, said the damosel, ye say
 sooth; therefore ye shall assay to do what ye may.  Then Balin
 took the sword by the girdle &lt;52&gt;and sheath, and drew it out
 easily; and when he looked on the sword it pleased him much. 
 Then had the king and all the barons great marvel that Balin had
 done that adventure, and many knights had great despite of Balin. 
 Certes, said the damosel, this is a passing good knight, and the
 best that ever I found, and most of worship without treason,
 treachery, or villainy, and many marvels shall he do.  Now,
 gentle and courteous knight, give me the sword again.  Nay, said
 Balin, for this sword will I keep, but it be taken from me with
 force.  Well, said the damosel, ye are not wise to keep the sword
 from me, for ye shall slay with the sword the best friend that ye
 have, and the man that ye most love in the world, and the sword
 shall be your destruction.  I shall take the adventure, said
 Balin, that God will ordain me, but the sword ye shall not have
 at this time, by the faith of my body.  Ye shall repent it within
 short time, said the damosel, for I would have the sword more for
 your avail than for mine, for I am passing heavy for your sake;
 for ye will not believe that sword shall be your destruction, and
 that is great pity.  With that the damosel departed, making great
 sorrow.
 
 Anon after, Balin sent for his horse and armour, and so would
 depart from the court, and took his leave of King Arthur.  Nay,
 said the king, I suppose ye will not depart so lightly from this
 fellowship, I suppose ye are displeased that I have shewed you
 unkindness; blame me the less, for I was misinformed against you,
 but I weened ye had not been such a knight as ye are, of worship
 and prowess, and if ye will abide in this court among my
 fellowship, I shall so advance you as ye shall be pleased.  God
 thank your highness, said Balin, your bounty and highness may no
 man praise half to the value; but at this time I must needs
 depart, beseeching you alway of your good grace.  Truly, said the
 king, I am right wroth for your departing; I pray you, fair
 knight, that ye tarry not long, and ye shall be right welcome to
 me, and to my barons, and I shall amend all miss that I have done
 against you; God thank your great lordship, said Balin, and
 therewith made him ready to depart.  Then the most &lt;53&gt;part of
 the knights of the Round Table said that Balin did not this
 adventure all only by might, but by witchcraft.
