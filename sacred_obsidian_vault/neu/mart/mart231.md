 CHAPTER XXXVIII
 
 How King Mark was sorry for the good renown of Sir
 Tristram.  Some of King Arthur's knights jousted
 with knights of Cornwall.
 
 NOW will we speak, and leave Sir Tristram, Sir Palomides, and Sir
 Dinadan in prison, and speak we of other knights that sought
 after Sir Tristram many divers parts of this land.  And some yede
 into Cornwall; and by adventure Sir Gaheris, nephew unto King
 Arthur, came unto King Mark, and there he was well received and
 sat at King Mark's own table and ate of his own mess.  Then King
 Mark asked Sir Gaheris what tidings there were in the realm of
 Logris.  Sir, said Sir Gaheris, the king reigneth as a noble
 knight; and now but late there was a great jousts and tournament
 as ever I saw any in the realm of Logris, and the most noble
 knights were at that jousts.  But there was one knight that did
 marvellously three days, and he bare a black shield, and of all
 knights that ever I saw he proved the best knight.  Then, said
 King Mark, that was Sir Launcelot, or Sir Palomides the paynim. 
 Not so, said Sir Gheris, for both Sir Launcelot and Sir Palomides
 were on the contrary party against the Knight with the Black
 Shield.  Then was it Sir Tristram, said the king.  Yea, said Sir
 Gaheris.  And therewithal the king smote down his head, and in
 his heart he feared sore that Sir Tristram should get him such
 worship in the realm of Logris wherethrough that he himself
 should not be able to withstand him.  Thus Sir Gaheris had great
 cheer with King Mark, and with Queen La Beale Isoud, the which
 was glad of Sir Gaheris' words; for well she wist by his deeds
 and manners that it was Sir Tristram.  And then the king made a
 feast royal, and to that feast came Sir Uwaine le Fise de Roy
 Ureine, and some called him Uwaine le Blanchemains.  And this Sir
 Uwaine challenged all the knights of Cornwall.  Then was the king
 wood wroth that he had no knights to answer him.  Then Sir
 &lt;421&gt;Andred, nephew unto King Mark, leapt up and said:  I will
 encounter with Sir Uwaine.  Then he yede and armed him and horsed
 him in the best manner.  And there Sir Uwaine met with Sir
 Andred, and smote him down that he swooned on the earth.  Then
 was King Mark sorry and wroth out of measure that he had no
 knight to revenge his nephew, Sir Andred.
 
 So the king called unto him Sir Dinas, the Seneschal, and prayed
 him for his sake to take upon him to joust with Sir Uwaine.  Sir,
 said Sir Dinas, I am full loath to have ado with any knight of
 the Round Table.  Yet, said the king, for my love take upon thee
 to joust.  So Sir Dinas made him ready, and anon they encountered
 together with great spears, but Sir Dinas was overthrown, horse
 and man, a great fall.  Who was wroth but King Mark!  Alas, he
 said, have I no knight that will encounter with yonder knight? 
 Sir, said Sir Gaheris, for your sake I will joust.  So Sir
 Gaheris made him ready, and when he was armed he rode into the
 field.  And when Sir Uwaine saw Sir Gaheris' shield he rode to
 him and said:  Sir, ye do not your part.  For, sir, the first
 time ye were made Knight of the Round Table ye sware that ye
 should not have ado with your fellowship wittingly.  And pardie,
 Sir Gaheris, ye knew me well enough by my shield, and so do I
 know you by your shield, and though ye would break your oath I
 would not break mine; for there is not one here, nor ye, that
 shall think I am afeard of you, but I durst right well have ado
 with you, and yet we be sisters' sons.  Then was Sir Gaheris
 ashamed, and so therewithal every knight went their way, and Sir
 Uwaine rode into the country.
 
 Then King Mark armed him, and took his horse and his spear, with
 a squire with him.  And then he rode afore Sir Uwaine, and
 suddenly at a gap he ran upon him as he that was not ware of him,
 and there he smote him almost through the body, and there left
 him.  So within a while there came Sir Kay and found Sir Uwaine,
 and asked him how he was hurt.  I wot not, said Sir Uwaine, why
 nor wherefore, but by treason I am sure I gat this &lt;422&gt;hurt; for
 here came a knight suddenly upon me or that I was ware, and
 suddenly hurt me.  Then there was come Sir Andred to seek King
 Mark.  Thou traitor knight, said Sir Kay, an I wist it were thou
 that thus traitorly hast hurt this noble knight thou shouldst
 never pass my hands.  Sir, said Sir Andred, I did never hurt him,
 and that I will report me to himself.  Fie on you false knight,
 said Sir Kay, for ye of Cornwall are nought worth.  So Sir Kay
 made carry Sir Uwaine to the Abbey of the Black Cross, and there
 he was healed.  And then Sir Gaheris took his leave of King Mark,
 but or he departed he said:  Sir king, ye did a foul shame unto
 you and your court, when ye banished Sir Tristram out of this
 country, for ye needed not to have doubted no knight an he had
 been here.  And so he departed.
