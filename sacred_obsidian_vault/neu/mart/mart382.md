 CHAPTER IX
 
 How Sir Percivale promised her help, and how he required
 her of love, and how he was saved from the fiend.
 
 
 THEN Sir Percivale promised her all the help that he
 might; and then she thanked him.  And at that time the
 weather was hot.  Then she called unto her a gentlewoman
 and bade her bring forth a pavilion; and so she
 did, and pight it upon the gravel.  Sir, said she, now may
 ye rest you in this heat of the day.  Then he thanked
 her, and she put off his helm and his shield, and there he
 slept a great while.  And then he awoke and asked her if
 she had any meat, and she said:  Yea, also ye shall have

 wit ye well ye are the knight in the world that I have
 most desire to.
 
 And then two squires were commanded to make a bed
 in midst of the pavilion.  And anon she was unclothed
 and laid therein.  And then Sir Percivale laid him down
 by her naked; and by adventure and grace he saw his
 sword lie on the ground naked, in whose pommel was a
 red cross and the sign of the crucifix therein, and bethought
 him on his knighthood and his promise made to-forehand
 unto the good man; then he made a sign of the cross in
 his forehead, and therewith the pavilion turned up-so-
