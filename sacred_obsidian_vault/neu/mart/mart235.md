 CHAPTER XLII
 
 How Sir Tristram took with him the shield, and also how
 he slew the paramour of Morgan le Fay.
 
 SO then Sir Tristram took his leave of the queen, and took the
 shield with him.  Then came the knight that held Queen Morgan le
 Fay, his name was Sir Hemison, and he made him ready to follow
 Sir Tristram.  Fair friend, said Morgan, ride not after that
 knight, for ye shall not win no worship of him.  Fie on him,
 coward, said Sir Hemison, for I wist never good knight come out
 of Cornwall but if it were Sir Tristram de Liones.  What an that
 be he? said she.  Nay, nay, said he, he is with La Beale Isoud,
 and this is but a daffish knight.  Alas, my fair friend, ye shall
 find him the best knight that ever ye met withal, for I know him
 better than ye do.  For your sake, said Sir Hemison, I shall slay
 him.  Ah, fair friend, said the queen, me repenteth that ye will
 follow that knight, for I fear me sore of your again coming. 
 With this this knight rode his way wood wroth, and he rode after
 Sir Tristram as fast as he had been chased with knights.  When
 Sir Tristram heard a knight come after him so fast he returned
 about, and saw a knight coming against him.  And when he came
 nigh to Sir Tristram he cried on high:  Sir knight, keep thee
 from me.  Then they rushed together as it had been thunder, and
 Sir Hemison brised his spear upon Sir Tristram, but his harness
 was so good that he might not &lt;430&gt;hurt him.  And Sir Tristram
 smote him harder, and bare him through the body, and he fell over
 his horse's croup.  Then Sir Tristram turned to have done more
 with his sword, but he saw so much blood go from him that him
 seemed he was likely to die, and so he departed from him and came
 to a fair manor to an old knight, and there Sir Tristram lodged.
