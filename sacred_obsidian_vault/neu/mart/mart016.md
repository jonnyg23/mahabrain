 CHAPTER XVII
 
 Yet more of the same battle, and how it was ended by Merlin.
 
 WHEN Sir Arthur and King Ban and Bors beheld them and all their
 knights, they praised them much for their noble cheer of
 chivalry, for the hardiest fighters that ever they heard or saw. 
 With that, there dressed them a forty noble knights, and said
 unto the three kings, they would break their battle; these were
 their names: Lionses, Phariance, Ulfius, Brastias, Ector, Kay,
 Lucas the butler, Griflet le Fise de Dieu, Mariet de la Roche,
 Guinas de Bloi, Briant de la Forest Savage, Bellaus, Morians of
 the Castle [of] Maidens, Flannedrius of the Castle of Ladies,
 Annecians that was King Bors' godson, a noble knight, Ladinas de
 la Rouse, Emerause, Caulas, Graciens le Castlein, one Blois de la
 Case, and Sir Colgrevaunce de Gorre; all these knights rode on
 afore with spears on their thighs, and spurred their horses
 mightily as the horses might run.  And the eleven kings with part
 of their knights rushed with their horses as fast as they might
 with their spears, and there they did on both parties marvellous
 deeds of &lt;31&gt;arms.  So came into the thick of the press, Arthur,
 Ban, and Bors, and slew down right on both hands, that their
 horses went in blood up to the fetlocks.  But ever the eleven
 kings and their host was ever in the visage of Arthur.  Wherefore
 Ban and Bors had great marvel, considering the great slaughter
 that there was, but at the last they were driven aback over a
 little river.  With that came Merlin on a great black horse, and
 said unto Arthur, Thou hast never done!  Hast thou not done
 enough? of three score thousand this day hast thou left alive but
 fifteen thousand, and it is time to say Ho!  For God is wroth
 with thee, that thou wilt never have done; for yonder eleven
 kings at this time will not be overthrown, but an thou tarry on
 them any longer, thy fortune will turn and they shall increase. 
 And therefore withdraw you unto your lodging, and rest you as
 soon as ye may, and reward your good knights with gold and with
 silver, for they have well deserved it; there may no riches be
 too dear for them, for of so few men as ye have, there were never
 men did more of prowess than they have done today, for ye have
 matched this day with the best fighters of the world.  That is
 truth, said King Ban and Bors.  Also said Merlin, withdraw you
 where ye list, for this three year I dare undertake they shall
 not dere you; and by then ye shall hear new tidings.  And then
 Merlin said unto Arthur, These eleven kings have more on hand
 than they are ware of, for the Saracens are landed in their
 countries, more than forty thousand, that burn and slay, and have
 laid siege at the castle Wandesborow, and make great destruction;
 therefore dread you not this three year.  Also, sir, all the
 goods that be gotten at this battle, let it be searched, and when
 ye have it in your hands, let it be given freely unto these two
 kings, Ban and Bors, that they may reward their knights withal;
 and that shall cause strangers to be of better will to do you
 service at need.  Also you be able to reward your own knights of
 your own goods whensomever it liketh you.  It is well said, quoth
 Arthur, and as thou hast devised, so shall it be done.  When it
 was delivered to Ban and Bors, they gave the &lt;32&gt;goods as freely
 to their knights as freely as it was given to them.  Then Merlin
 took his leave of Arthur and of the two kings, for to go and see
 his master Bleise, that dwelt in Northumberland; and so he
 departed and came to his master, that was passing glad of his
 coming; and there he told how Arthur and the two kings had sped
 at the great battle, and how it was ended, and told the names of
 every king and knight of worship that was there.  And so Bleise
 wrote the battle word by word, as Merlin told him, how it began,
 and by whom, and in likewise how it was ended, and who had the
 worse.  All the battles that were done in Arthur's days Merlin
 did his master Bleise do write; also he did do write all the
 battles that every worthy knight did of Arthur's court.
 
 After this Merlin departed from his master and came to King
 Arthur, that was in the castle of Bedegraine, that was one of the
 castles that stand in the forest of Sherwood.  And Merlin was so
 disguised that King Arthur knew him not, for he was all befurred
 in black sheep-skins, and a great pair of boots, and a bow and
 arrows, in a russet gown, and brought wild geese in his hand, and
 it was on the morn after Candlemas day; but King Arthur knew him
 not.  Sir, said Merlin unto the king, will ye give me a gift? 
 Wherefore, said King Arthur, should I give thee a gift, churl? 
 Sir, said Merlin, ye were better to give me a gift that is not in
 your hand than to lose great riches, for here in the same place
 where the great battle was, is great treasure hid in the earth. 
 Who told thee so, churl? said Arthur.  Merlin told me so, said
 he.  Then Ulfius and Brastias knew him well enough, and smiled. 
 Sir, said these two knights, it is Merlin that so speaketh unto
 you.  Then King Arthur was greatly abashed, and had marvel of
 Merlin, and so had King Ban and King Bors, and so they had great
 disport at him.  So in the meanwhile there came a damosel that
 was an earl's daughter: his name was Sanam, and her name was
 Lionors, a passing fair damosel; and so she came thither for to
 do homage, as other lords did after the great battle.  And King
 Arthur set his love greatly upon her, and so did she upon him,
 and the king &lt;33&gt;had ado with her, and gat on her a child: his
 name was Borre, that was after a good knight, and of the Table
 Round.  Then there came word that the King Rience of North Wales
 made great war on King Leodegrance of Cameliard, for the which
 thing Arthur was wroth, for he loved him well, and hated King
 Rience, for he was alway against him.  So by ordinance of the
 three kings that were sent home unto Benwick, all they would
 depart for dread of King Claudas; and Phariance, and Antemes, and
 Gratian, and Lionses [of] Payarne, with the leaders of those that
 should keep the kings' lands.
