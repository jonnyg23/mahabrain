 CHAPTER VI
 
 How Sir Launcelot brought Sir Tristram to the court, and
 of the great joy that the king and other made for the
 coming of Sir Tristram.
 
 
 RETURN again, said Sir Launcelot, for your quest is done,
 for I have met with Sir Tristram: lo, here is his own
 person!  Then was Sir Gawaine glad, and said to Sir
 Tristram:  Ye are welcome, for now have ye eased me
 greatly of my labour.  For what cause, said Sir Gawaine,
 came ye into this court?  Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, I
 came into this country because of Sir Palomides; for he
 and I had assigned at this day to have done battle together
 at the peron, and I marvel I hear not of him.  And thus
 by adventure my lord, Sir Launcelot, and I met together.
 With this came King Arthur, and when he wist that there
 was Sir Tristram, then he ran unto him and took him by
 the hand and said:  Sir Tristram, ye are as welcome as any
 knight that ever came to this court.  And when the king
 had heard how Sir Launcelot and he had foughten, and
 either had wounded other wonderly sore, then the king
 made great dole.  Then Sir Tristram told the king how
 he came thither for to have had ado with Sir Palomides.
 And then he told the king how he had rescued him from
 the nine knights and Breuse Saunce Pit<e>; and how he
 found a knight lying by a well, and that knight smote
 down Sir Palomides and me, but his shield was covered
 with a cloth.  So Sir Palomides left me, and I followed
 after that knight; and in many places I found where he
 had slain knights, and forjousted many.  By my head,
 said Sir Gawaine, that same knight smote me down and
 Sir Bleoberis, and hurt us sore both, he with the covered
 shield.  Ah, said Sir Kay, that knight smote me adown
 and hurt me passing sore, and fain would I have known
 him, but I might not.  Jesu, mercy, said Arthur, what
 knight was that with the covered shield?  I know not,
 said Sir Tristram; and so said they all.  Now, said King
 Arthur, then wot I, for it is Sir Launcelot.  Then they
 all looked upon Sir Launcelot and said:  Ye have beguiled
 us with your covered shield.  It is not the first time, said
 Arthur, he hath done so.  My lord, said Sir Launcelot,
 truly wit ye well I was the same knight that bare the
 covered shield; and because I would not be known that I
 was of your court I said no worship of your house.  That
 is truth, said Sir Gawaine, Sir Kay, and Sir Bleoberis.
 
 Then King Arthur took Sir Tristram by the hand and
 went to the Table Round.  Then came Queen Guenever
 and many ladies with her, and all the ladies said at one
 voice:  Welcome, Sir Tristram!  Welcome, said the
 damosels.  Welcome, said knights.  Welcome, said
 Arthur, for one of the best knights, and the gentlest of
 the world, and the man of most worship; for of all
 manner of hunting thou bearest the prize, and of all
 measures of blowing thou art the beginning, and of all the
 terms of hunting and hawking ye are the beginner, of all
 instruments of music ye are the best; therefore, gentle
 knight, said Arthur, ye are welcome to this court.  And
 also, I pray you, said Arthur, grant me a boon.  It shall
 be at your commandment, said Tristram.  Well, said
 Arthur, I will desire of you that ye will abide in my court.
 Sir, said Sir Tristram, thereto is me loath, for I have ado
 in many countries.  Not so, said Arthur, ye have promised
 it me, ye may not say nay.  Sir, said Sir Tristram, I will
 as ye will.  Then went Arthur unto the sieges about the
 Round Table, and looked in every siege the which were
 void that lacked knights.  And then the king saw in the
 siege of Marhaus letters that said:  This is the siege of the
 noble knight, Sir Tristram.  And then Arthur made Sir
 Tristram Knight of the Table Round, with great nobley
 and great feast as might be thought.  For Sir Marhaus
 was slain afore by the hands of Sir Tristram in an island;
 and that was well known at that time in the court of
 Arthur, for this Marhaus was a worthy knight.  And for
 evil deeds that he did unto the country of Cornwall Sir
 Tristram and he fought.  And they fought so long,
 tracing and traversing, till they fell bleeding to the earth;
 for they were so sore wounded that they might not stand
 for bleeding.  And Sir Tristram by fortune recovered, and
 Sir Marhaus died through the stroke on the head.  So
 leave we of Sir Tristram and speak we of King Mark.
