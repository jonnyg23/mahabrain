 CHAPTER XLV
 
 Of the fourth day, and of many great feats of arms.
 
 
 HERE beginneth the fourth day.  Then came into the
 field the King with the Hundred Knights, and all they of
 Northgalis, and the Duke Chaleins of Clarance, and King
 Marsil of Pomitain, and there came Safere, Palomides'
 brother, and there he told him tidings of his mother.
 And his name was called the Earl, and so he appealed
 him afore King Arthur:  For he made war upon our
 father and mother, and there I slew him in plain battle.
 So they went into the field, and the damosel with them;
 and there came to encounter again them Sir Bleoberis de
 Ganis, and Sir Ector de Maris.  Sir Palomides encountered
 with Sir Bleoberis, and either smote other down.  And in
 the same wise did Sir Safere and Sir Ector, and the two
 couples did battle on foot.  Then came in Sir Lamorak,
 and he encountered with the King with the Hundred
 Knights, and smote him quite over his horse's tail.  And
 in the same wise he served the King of Northgalis, and
 also he smote down King Marsil.  And so or ever he
 stint he smote down with his spear and with his sword
 thirty knights.  When Duke Chaleins saw Lamorak do
 so great prowess he would not meddle with him for
 shame; and then he charged all his knights in pain of
 death that none of you touch him; for it were shame to
 all good knights an that knight were shamed.
 
 Then the two kings gathered them together, and all
 they set upon Sir Lamorak; and he failed them not, but
 rushed here and there, smiting on the right hand and on
 the left, and raced off many helms, so that the haut
 prince and Queen Guenever said they saw never knight
 do such deeds of arms on horseback.  Alas, said Launcelot
 to King Bagdemagus, I will arm me and help Sir
 Lamorak.  And I will ride with you, said King Bagdemagus.
 And when they two were horsed they came to
 Sir Lamorak that stood among thirty knights; and well
 was him that might reach him a buffet, and ever he smote
 again mightily.  Then came there into the press Sir
 Launcelot, and he threw down Sir Mador de la Porte.
 And with the truncheon of that spear he threw down
 many knights.  And King Bagdemagus smote on the left
 hand and on the right hand marvellously well.  And then
 the three kings fled aback.  Therewithal then Sir Galahalt
 let blow to lodging, and all the heralds gave Sir Lamorak
 the prize.  And all this while fought Palomides, Sir
 Bleoberis, Sir Safere, Sir Ector on foot; never were there
 four knights evener matched.  And then they were departed,
 and had unto their lodging, and unarmed them,
 and so they went to the great feast.
 
 But when Sir Lamorak was come into the court Queen
 Guenever took him in her arms and said:  Sir, well have
 ye done this day.  Then came the haut prince, and he
 made of him great joy, and so did Dinadan, for he wept
 for joy; but the joy that Sir Launcelot made of Sir
 Lamorak there might no man tell.  Then they went unto
 rest, and on the morn the haut prince let blow unto the
 field.
