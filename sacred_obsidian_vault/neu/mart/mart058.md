 CHAPTER XIII
 
 How King Pellinore gat the lady and brought her to Camelot
 to the court of King Arthur.
 
 AND then he turned him to the other knight, that was sore
 wounded.  But when he saw the other's buffet, he would not fight,
 but kneeled down and said, Take my cousin the lady with you at
 your request, and I require you, as ye be a true knight, put her
 to no shame nor villainy.  What, said King Pellinore, will ye not
 fight for her?  No, sir, said the knight, I will not fight with
 such a knight of prowess as ye be.  Well, said Pellinore, ye say
 well; I promise you she shall have no villainy by me, as I am
 true knight; but now me lacketh an horse, said Pellinore, but I
 will have Hontzlake's horse.  Ye shall not need, said the knight,
 for I shall give you such an horse as shall please you, so that
 you will lodge with me, for it is near night.  I will well, said
 King Pellinore, abide with you all night.  And there he had with
 him right good cheer, and fared of the best with passing good
 wine, and had merry rest that night.  And on the morn he heard a
 mass and dined; and then was brought him a fair bay courser, and
 King Pellinore's saddle set upon him.  Now, what shall I call
 you? said the knight, inasmuch as ye have my cousin at your
 desire of your quest.  Sir, I shall tell you, my name is King
 Pellinore of the Isles and knight of the Table Round.  Now I am
 glad, said the knight, that such a noble man shall have the rule
 of my cousin.  Now, what is your name? said Pellinore, I pray you
 tell me.  Sir, my name is Sir Meliot of Logurs, and this lady my
 cousin hight Nimue, and the knight that was in the other pavilion
 is my sworn brother, a passing good knight, and his name is Brian
 of the Isles, and he is full loath to do wrong, and full loath to
 fight with any man, but if he be sore sought on, so that for
 shame he may not leave it.  It is marvel, said Pellinore, that he
 will not &lt;98&gt;have ado with me.  Sir, he will not have ado with no
 man but if it be at his request.  Bring him to the court, said
 Pellinore, one of these days.  Sir, we will come together.  And
 ye shall be welcome, said Pellinore, to the court of King Arthur,
 and greatly allowed for your coming.  And so he departed with the
 lady, and brought her to Camelot.
 
 So as they rode in a valley it was full of stones, and there the
 lady's horse stumbled and threw her down, that her arm was sore
 bruised and near she swooned for pain.  Alas! sir, said the lady,
 mine arm is out of lithe, wherethrough I must needs rest me.  Ye
 shall well, said King Pellinore.  And so he alighted under a fair
 tree where was fair grass, and he put his horse thereto, and so
 laid him under the tree and slept till it was nigh night.  And
 when he awoke he would have ridden.  Sir, said the lady, it is so
 dark that ye may as well ride backward as forward.  So they abode
 still and made there their lodging.  Then Sir Pellinore put off
 his armour; then a little afore midnight they heard the trotting
 of an horse.  Be ye still, said King Pellinore, for we shall hear
 of some adventure.
