 CHAPTER IX
 
 How Galahad gat him a shield, and how they sped that
 presumed to take down the said shield.
 
 
 NOW rideth Sir Galahad yet without shield, and so he
 rode four days without any adventure.  And at the
 fourth day after evensong he came to a White Abbey, and
 there he was received with great reverence, and led unto
 a chamber, and there was he unarmed; and then was he
 ware of two[1] knights of the Table Round, one was Sir
 Bagdemagus, and[1] that[1] other[1] was Sir Uwaine.  And when
 they saw him they went unto Galahad and made of him
 great solace, and so they went unto supper.  Sirs, said Sir
 Galahad, what adventure brought you hither?  Sir, said
 they, it is told us that within this place is a shield that
 no man may bear about his neck but he be mischieved
 outher dead within three days, or maimed for ever.  Ah
 sir, said King Bagdemagus, I shall it bear to-morrow for
 to assay this adventure.  In the name of God, said Sir
 Galahad.  Sir, said Bagdemagus, an I may not enchieve
 the adventure of this shield ye shall take it upon you,
 for I am sure ye shall not fail.  Sir, said Galahad, I right
 well agree me thereto, for I have no shield.  So on the
 morn they arose and heard mass.  Then Bagdemagus
 asked where the adventurous shield was.  Anon a monk
 led him behind an altar where the shield hung as white as
 any snow, but in the midst was a red cross.  Sir, said the
 monk, this shield ought not to be hanged about no
 knight's neck but he be the worthiest knight of the world;
 
 
 [1] Omitted by Caxton, supplied from W. de Worde.
 
 therefore I counsel you knights to be well advised.  Well,
 said Bagdemagus, I wot well that I am not the best knight
 of the world, but yet I shall assay to bear it, and so bare
 it out of the minster.  And then he said unto Galahad:
 An it please you abide here still, till ye wit how that I
 speed.  I shall abide you, said Galahad.  Then King
 Bagdemagus took with him a good squire, to bring tidings
 unto Sir Galahad how he sped.
 
 Then when they had ridden a two mile and came
 to a fair valley afore an hermitage, then they saw a
 knight come from that part in white armour, horse and
 all; and he came as fast as his horse might run, and his
 spear in his rest, and Bagdemagus dressed his spear
 against him and brake it upon the white knight.  But the
 other struck him so hard that he brast the mails, and
 sheef him through the right shoulder, for the shield
 covered him not as at that time; and so he bare him from
 his horse.  And therewith he alighted and took the white
 shield from him, saying:  Knight, thou hast done thyself
 great folly, for this shield ought not to be borne but by
 him that shall have no peer that liveth.  And then he
 came to Bagdemagus' squire and said:  Bear this shield
 unto the good knight Sir Galahad, that thou left in the
 abbey, and greet him well by me.  Sir, said the squire,
 what is your name?  Take thou no heed of my name,
 said the knight, for it is not for thee to know nor
 for none earthly man.  Now, fair sir, said the squire, at
 the reverence of Jesu Christ, tell me for what cause this
 shield may not be borne but if the bearer thereof be
 mischieved.  Now sith thou hast conjured me so, said the
 knight, this shield behoveth unto no man but unto Galahad.
 And the squire went unto Bagdemagus and asked whether
 he were sore wounded or not.  Yea forsooth, said he, I
 shall escape hard from the death.  Then he fetched his
 horse, and brought him with great pain unto an abbey.
 Then was he taken down softly and unarmed, and laid in a
 bed, and there was looked to his wounds.  And as the book
 telleth, he lay there long, and escaped hard with the life.
