 CHAPTER XIII
 
 Of the adventure that Melias had, and how Galahad revenged
 him, and how Melias was carried into an abbey.
 
 
 AND then rode Melias into an old forest, and therein he
 rode two days and more.  And then he came into a fair
 meadow, and there was a fair lodge of boughs.  And then
 he espied in that lodge a chair, wherein was a crown of gold,
 subtly wrought.  Also there were cloths covered upon the
 earth, and many delicious meats set thereon.  Sir Melias
 beheld this adventure, and thought it marvellous, but he
 had no hunger, but of the crown of gold he took much
 keep; and therewith he stooped down and took it up, and
 rode his way with it.  And anon he saw a knight came
 riding after him that said:  Knight, set down that crown
 which is not yours, and therefore defend you.  Then Sir
 Melias blessed him and said:  Fair lord of heaven, help and
 save thy new-made knight.  And then they let their horses
 run as fast as they might, so that the other knight smote
 Sir Melias through hauberk and through the left side, that
 he fell to the earth nigh dead.  And then he took the
 crown and went his way; and Sir Melias lay still and had
 no power to stir.
 
 In the meanwhile by fortune there came Sir Galahad
 and found him there in peril of death.  And then he said:
 Ah Melias, who hath wounded you? therefore it had been
 better to have ridden the other way.  And when Sir
 Melias heard him speak:  Sir, he said, for God's love let
 me not die in this forest, but bear me unto the abbey here
 beside, that I may be confessed and have my rights.  It
 shall be done, said Galahad, but where is he that hath
 wounded you?  With that Sir Galahad heard in the leaves
 cry on high:  Knight, keep thee from me.  Ah sir, said
 Melias, beware, for that is he that hath slain me.  Sir
 Galahad answered:  Sir knight, come on your peril.  Then
 either dressed to other, and came together as fast as their
 horses might run, and Galahad smote him so that his spear
 went through his shoulder, and smote him down off his
 horse, and in the falling Galahad's spear brake.
 
 With that came out another knight out of the leaves,
 and brake a spear upon Galahad or ever he might turn
 him.  Then Galahad drew out his sword and smote off
 the left arm of him, so that it fell to the earth.  And then
 he fled, and Sir Galahad pursued fast after him.  And then
 he turned again unto Sir Melias, and there he alighted and
 dressed him softly on his horse to-fore him, for the truncheon
 of his spear was in his body; and Sir Galahad stert up
 behind him, and held him in his arms, and so brought him
 to the abbey, and there unarmed him and brought him
 to his chamber.  And then he asked his Saviour.  And
 when he had received Him he said unto Sir Galahad:  Sir,
 let death come when it pleaseth him.  And therewith he
 drew out the truncheon of the spear out of his body: and
 then he swooned.
 
 Then came there an old monk which sometime had
 been a knight, and beheld Sir Melias.  And anon he ransacked
 him; and then he said unto Sir Galahad:  I shall
 heal him of his wound, by the grace of God, within the
 term of seven weeks.  Then was Sir Galahad glad, and
 unarmed him, and said he would abide there three days.
 And then he asked Sir Melias how it stood with him.
 Then he said he was turned unto helping, God be
 thanked.
