 CHAPTER III
 
 How Sir Tristram sought a strong knight that had smitten
 him down, and many other knights of the Round Table.
 
 
 AND so Sir Tristram rode long after this strong knight.
 And at the last he saw where lay a lady overthwart a dead
 knight.  Fair lady, said Sir Tristram, who hath slain your
 lord?  Sir, she said, here came a knight riding, as my lord
 and I rested us here, and asked him of whence he was,
 and my lord said of Arthur's court.  Therefore, said the
 strong knight, I will joust with thee, for I hate all these
 that be of Arthur's court.  And my lord that lieth here
 dead amounted upon his horse, and the strong knight and
 my lord encountered together, and there he smote my
 lord throughout with his spear, and thus he hath brought
 me in great woe and damage.  That me repenteth, said
 Sir Tristram, of your great anger; an it please you tell
 me your husband's name.  Sir, said she, his name was
 Galardoun, that would have proved a good knight.  So
 departed Sir Tristram from that dolorous lady, and had
 much evil lodging.  Then on the third day Sir Tristram
 met with Sir Gawaine and with Sir Bleoberis in a forest at
 a lodge, and either were sore wounded.  Then Sir Tristram
 asked Sir Gawaine and Sir Bleoberis if they met with such
 a knight, with such a cognisance, with a covered shield.
 Fair sir, said these knights, such a knight met with us to
 our great damage.  And first he smote down my fellow,
 Sir Bleoberis, and sore wounded him because he bade me
 I should not have ado with him, for why he was overstrong
 for me.  That strong knight took his words at
 scorn, and said he said it for mockery.  And then they
 rode together, and so he hurt my fellow.  And when he
 had done so I might not for shame but I must joust with
 him.  And at the first course he smote me down and my
 horse to the earth.  And there he had almost slain me,
 and from us he took his horse and departed, and in an
 evil time we met with him.  Fair knights, said Sir
 Tristram, so he met with me, and with another knight
 that hight Palomides, and he smote us both down with
 one spear, and hurt us right sore.  By my faith, said Sir
 Gawaine, by my counsel ye shall let him pass and seek
 him no further; for at the next feast of the Round Table,
 upon pain of my head ye shall find him there.  By my
 faith, said Sir Tristram, I shall never rest till that I find
 him.  And then Sir Gawaine asked him his name.  Then
 he said:  My name is Sir Tristram.  And so either told
 other their names, and then departed Sir Tristram and
 rode his way.
 
 And by fortune in a meadow Sir Tristram met with Sir
 Kay, the Seneschal, and Sir Dinadan.  What tidings with
 you, said Sir Tristram, with you knights?  Not good,
 said these knights.  Why so? said Sir Tristram; I pray
 you tell me, for I ride to seek a knight.  What cognisance
 beareth he? said Sir Kay.  He beareth, said Sir Tristram,
 a covered shield close with cloth.  By my head, said Sir
 Kay, that is the same knight that met with us, for this
 night we were lodged within a widow's house, and there
 was that knight lodged; and when he wist we were of
 Arthur's court he spoke great villainy by the king, and
 specially by the Queen Guenever, and then on the morn
 was waged battle with him for that cause.  And at the
 first recounter, said Sir Kay, he smote me down from my
 horse and hurt me passing sore; and when my fellow, Sir
 Dinadan, saw me smitten down and hurt he would not
 revenge me, but fled from me; and thus he departed.
 And then Sir Tristram asked them their names, and so
 either told other their names.  And so Sir Tristram
 departed from Sir Kay, and from Sir Dinadan, and so he
 passed through a great forest into a plain, till he was ware
 of a priory, and there he reposed him with a good man
 six days.
