 CHAPTER II
 
 How Sir Tristram saved Sir Palomides' life, and how they
 promised to fight together within a fortnight.
 
 
 So Sir Tristram alighted off his horse because they were
 on foot, that they should not slay his horse, and then
 dressed his shield, with his sword in his hand, and he
 smote on the right hand and on the left hand passing
 sore, that well-nigh at every stroke he struck down a
 knight.  And when they espied his strokes they fled all
 with Breuse Saunce Pit<e> unto the tower, and Sir Tristram
 followed fast after with his sword in his hand, but they
 escaped into the tower, and shut Sir Tristram without the
 gate.  And when Sir Tristram saw this he returned aback
 unto Sir Palomides, and found him sitting under a tree
 sore wounded.  Ah, fair knight, said Sir Tristram, well
 be ye found.  Gramercy, said Sir Palomides, of your great
 goodness, for ye have rescued me of my life, and saved
 me from my death.  What is your name? said Sir
 Tristram.  He said:  My name is Sir Palomides.  O
 Jesu, said Sir Tristram, thou hast a fair grace of me this
 day that I should rescue thee, and thou art the man in
 the world that I most hate; but now make thee ready,
 for I will do battle with thee.  What is your name?
 said Sir Palomides.  My name is Sir Tristram, your
 mortal enemy.  It may be so, said Sir Palomides; but ye
 have done over much for me this day that I should fight
 with you; for inasmuch as ye have saved my life it will
 be no worship for you to have ado with me, for ye are
 fresh and I am wounded sore, and therefore, an ye will
 needs have ado with me, assign me a day and then I
 shall meet with you without fail.  Ye say well, said Sir
 Tristram, now I assign you to meet me in the meadow
 by the river of Camelot, where Merlin set the peron.
 So they were agreed.
 
 Then Sir Tristram asked Sir Palomides why the ten
 knights did battle with him.  For this cause, said Sir
 Palomides; as I rode upon mine adventures in a forest
 here beside I espied where lay a dead knight, and a lady
 weeping beside him.  And when I saw her making such
 dole, I asked her who slew her lord.  Sir, she said, the
 falsest knight of the world now living, and he is the most
 villain that ever man heard speak of and his name is Sir
 Breuse Saunce Pit<e>.  Then for pity I made the damosel
 to leap on her palfrey, and I promised her to be her
 warrant, and to help her to inter her lord.  And so,
 suddenly, as I came riding by this tower, there came out
 Sir Breuse Saunce Pit<e>, and suddenly he struck me from
 my horse.  And then or I might recover my horse this
 Sir Breuse slew the damosel.  And so I took my horse
 again, and I was sore ashamed, and so began the medley
 betwixt us: and this is the cause wherefore we did this
 battle.  Well, said Sir Tristram, now I understand the
 manner of your battle, but in any wise have remembrance
 of your promise that ye have made with me to do battle
 with me this day fortnight.  I shall not fail you, said Sir
 Palomides.  Well, said Sir Tristram, as at this time I will
 not fail you till that ye be out of the danger of your
 enemies.
 
 So they mounted upon their horses, and rode together
 unto that forest, and there they found a fair well, with
 clear water bubbling.  Fair sir, said Sir Tristram, to drink
 of that water have I courage; and then they alighted off
 their horses.  And then were they ware by them where
 stood a great horse tied to a tree, and ever he neighed.
 And then were they ware of a fair knight armed, under
 a tree, lacking no piece of harness, save his helm lay
 under his head.  By the good lord, said Sir Tristram,
 yonder lieth a well-faring knight; what is best to do?
 Awake him, said Sir Palomides.  So Sir Tristram awaked
 him with the butt of his spear.  And so the knight rose
 up hastily and put his helm upon his head, and gat a great
 spear in his hand; and without any more words he hurled
 unto Sir Tristram, and smote him clean from his saddle to
 the earth, and hurt him on the left side, that Sir Tristram
 lay in great peril.  Then he walloped farther, and fetched
 his course, and came hurling upon Sir Palomides, and there
 he struck him a part through the body, that he fell from
 his horse to the earth.  And then this strange knight left
 them there, and took his way through the forest.  With
 this Sir Palomides and Sir Tristram were on foot, and gat
 their horses again, and either asked counsel of other, what
 was best to do.  By my head, said Sir Tristram, I will
 follow this strong knight that thus hath shamed us.
 Well, said Sir Palomides, and I will repose me hereby with
 a friend of mine.  Beware, said Sir Tristram unto Palomides,
 that ye fail not that day that ye have set with me
 to do battle, for, as I deem, ye will not hold your day,
 for I am much bigger than ye.  As for that, said Sir
 Palomides, be it as it be may, for I fear you not, for an I
 be not sick nor prisoner, I will not fail you; but I have
 cause to have more doubt of you that ye will not meet
 with me, for ye ride after yonder strong knight.  And if
 ye meet with him it is an hard adventure an ever ye escape
 his hands.  Right so Sir Tristram and Sir Palomides
 departed, and either took their ways diverse.
