 CHAPTER VII
 
 How the queen desired to see Galahad; and how after, all
 the knights were replenished with the Holy Sangreal,
 and how they avowed the enquest of the same.
 
 
 THEN the king, at the queen's request, made him to
 alight and to unlace his helm, that the queen might see
 him in the visage.  When she beheld him she said:
 Soothly I dare well say that Sir Launcelot begat him, for
 never two men resembled more in likeness, therefore it nis
 no marvel though he be of great prowess.  So a lady that
 stood by the queen said:  Madam, for God's sake ought
 he of right to be so good a knight?  Yea, forsooth, said
 the queen, for he is of all parties come of the best knights
 of the world and of the highest lineage; for Sir Launcelot
 is come but of the eighth degree from our Lord Jesu
 Christ, and Sir Galahad is of the ninth degree from our
 Lord Jesu Christ, therefore I dare say they be the greatest
 gentlemen of the world.
 
 And then the king and all estates went home unto
 Camelot, and so went to evensong to the great minster,
 and so after upon that to supper, and every knight sat in
 his own place as they were toforehand.  Then anon they
 heard cracking and crying of thunder, that them thought
 the place should all to-drive.  In the midst of this blast
 entered a sunbeam more clearer by seven times than ever
 they saw day, and all they were alighted of the grace of
 the Holy Ghost.  Then began every knight to behold
 other, and either saw other, by their seeming, fairer than
 ever they saw afore.  Not for then there was no knight
 might speak one word a great while, and so they looked
 every man on other as they had been dumb.  Then there
 entered into the hall the Holy Grail covered with white
 samite, but there was none might see it, nor who bare it.
 And there was all the hall fulfilled with good odours, and
 every knight had such meats and drinks as he best loved
 in this world.  And when the Holy Grail had been borne
 through the hall, then the holy vessel departed suddenly,
 that they wist not where it became: then had they all
 breath to speak.  And then the king yielded thankings
 to God, of His good grace that he had sent them.  Certes,
 said the king, we ought to thank our Lord Jesu greatly
 for that he hath shewed us this day, at the reverence of this
 high feast of Pentecost.
 
 Now, said Sir Gawaine, we have been served this day
 of what meats and drinks we thought on; but one thing
 beguiled us, we might not see the Holy Grail, it was so
 preciously covered.  Wherefore I will make here avow,
 that to-morn, without longer abiding, I shall labour in the
 quest of the Sangreal, that I shall hold me out a twelvemonth
 and a day, or more if need be, and never shall I
 return again unto the court till I have seen it more openly
 than it hath been seen here; and if I may not speed I
 shall return again as he that may not be against the will of
 our Lord Jesu Christ.
 
 When they of the Table Round heard Sir Gawaine say
 so, they arose up the most part and made such avows as
 Sir Gawaine had made.  Anon as King Arthur heard this
 he was greatly displeased, for he wist well they might not
 again-say their avows.  Alas, said King Arthur unto
 Sir Gawaine, ye have nigh slain me with the avow and
 promise that ye have made; for through you ye have
 bereft me the fairest fellowship and the truest of
 knighthood that ever were seen together in any realm of the
 world; for when they depart from hence I am sure they
 all shall never meet more in this world, for they shall die
 many in the quest.  And so it forthinketh me a little, for
 I have loved them as well as my life, wherefore it shall
 grieve me right sore, the departition of this fellowship:
 for I have had an old custom to have them in my fellowship.
