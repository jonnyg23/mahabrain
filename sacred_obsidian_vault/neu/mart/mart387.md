 CHAPTER IV
 
 How the hermit expounded to Sir Launcelot his advision, and
 told him that Sir Galahad was his son.
 
 
 LO, Sir Launcelot, said the good man, there thou mightest
 understand the high lineage that thou art come of, and
 thine advision betokeneth.  After the passion of Jesu
 Christ forty year, Joseph of Aramathie preached the victory
 of King Evelake, that he had in the battles the better of
 his enemies.  And of the seven kings and the two knights:
 the first of them is called Nappus, an holy man; and the
 second hight Nacien, in remembrance of his grandsire, and
 in him dwelled our Lord Jesu Christ; and the third was
 called Helias le Grose; and the fourth hight Lisais; and
 the fifth hight Jonas, he departed out of his country and
 went into Wales, and took there the daughter of Manuel,
 whereby he had the land of Gaul, and he came to dwell in
 this country.  And of him came King Launcelot thy
 grandsire, the which there wedded the king's daughter of
 Ireland, and he was as worthy a man as thou art, and of
 him came King Ban, thy father, the which was the last of
 the seven kings.  And by thee, Sir Launcelot, it signifieth
 that the angels said thou were none of the seven fellowships.
 And the last was the ninth knight, he was signified
 to a lion, for he should pass all manner of earthly knights,
 that is Sir Galahad, the which thou gat on King Pelles'
 daughter; and thou ought to thank God more than any
 other man living, for of a sinner earthly thou hast no peer
 as in knighthood, nor never shall be.  But little thank hast
 thou given to God for all the great virtues that God hath
 lent thee.  Sir, said Launcelot, ye say that that good
 knight is my son.  That oughtest thou to know and no
 man better, said the good man, for thou knewest the
 daughter of King Pelles fleshly, and on her thou begattest
 Galahad, and that was he that at the feast of Pentecost sat
 in the Siege Perilous; and therefore make thou it known
 openly that he is one of thy begetting on King Pelles'
 daughter, for that will be your worship and honour, and to
 all thy kindred.  And I counsel you in no place press not
 upon him to have ado with him.  Well, said Launcelot,
 meseemeth that good knight should pray for me unto the
 High Father, that I fall not to sin again.  Trust thou
 well, said the good man, thou farest mickle the better for
 his prayer; but the son shall not bear the wickedness of
 the father, nor the father shall not bear the wickedness of
 the son, but everych shall bear his own burden.  And
 therefore beseek thou only God, and He will help thee in
 all thy needs.  And then Sir Launcelot and he went to
 supper, and so laid him to rest, and the hair pricked so Sir
 Launcelot's skin which grieved him full sore, but he took
 it meekly, and suffered the pain.  And so on the morn
 he heard his mass and took his arms, and so took his
 leave.
