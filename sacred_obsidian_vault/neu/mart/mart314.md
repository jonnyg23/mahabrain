 CHAPTER LXXVII
 
 How Sir Tristram departed with La Beale Isoud, and how
 Palomides followed and excused him.
 
 
 THEN they blew unto lodging, and Queen Isoud was led
 unto her pavilions.  But wit you well she was wroth out
 of measure with Sir Palomides, for she saw all his treason
 from the beginning to the ending.  And all this while
 neither Sir Tristram, neither Sir Gareth nor Dinadan, knew
 not of the treason of Sir Palomides; but afterward ye
 shall hear that there befell the greatest debate betwixt Sir
 Tristram and Sir Palomides that might be.
 
 So when the tournament was done, Sir Tristram,
 Gareth, and Dinadan, rode with La Beale Isoud to these
 pavilions.  And ever Sir Palomides rode with them in
 their company disguised as he was.  But when Sir Tristram
 had espied him that he was the same knight with the
 shield of silver that held him so hot that day:  Sir knight,
 said Sir Tristram, wit ye well here is none that hath need
 of your fellowship, and therefore I pray you depart from
 us.  Sir Palomides answered again as though he had not
 known Sir Tristram:  Wit you well, sir knight, from this
 fellowship will I never depart, for one of the best knights
 of the world commanded me to be in this company, and
 till he discharge me of my service I will not be discharged.
 By that Sir Tristram knew that it was Sir Palomides.  Ah,
 Sir Palomides, said the noble knight Sir Tristram, are ye
 such a knight? Ye have been named wrong, for ye have
 long been called a gentle knight, and as this day ye have
 showed me great ungentleness, for ye had almost brought
 me unto my death.  But, as for you, I suppose I should
 have done well enough, but Sir Launcelot with you was
 overmuch; for I know no knight living but Sir Launcelot
 is over good for him, an he will do his uttermost.  Alas,
 said Sir Palomides, are ye my lord Sir Tristram? Yea,
 sir, and that ye know well enough.  By my knighthood,
 said Palomides, until now I knew you not; I weened that
 ye had been the King of Ireland, for well I wot ye bare his
 arms.  His arms I bare, said Sir Tristram, and that will I
 stand by, for I won them once in a field of a full noble
 knight, his name was Sir Marhaus; and with great pain
 I won that knight, for there was none other recover, but
 Sir Marhaus died through false leeches; and yet was he
 never yolden to me.  Sir, said Palomides, I weened ye
 had been turned upon Sir Launcelot's party, and that
 caused me to turn.  Ye say well, said Sir Tristram, and
 so I take you, and I forgive you.
 
 So then they rode into their pavilions; and when they
 were alighted they unarmed them and washed their faces
 and hands, and so yode unto meat, and were set at their
 table.  But when Isoud saw Sir Palomides she changed
 then her colours, and for wrath she might not speak.
 Anon Sir Tristram espied her countenance and said:
 Madam, for what cause make ye us such cheer? we have
 been sore travailed this day.  Mine own lord, said La
 Beale Isoud, for God's sake be ye not displeased with me,
 for I may none otherwise do; for I saw this day how ye
 were betrayed and nigh brought to your death.  Truly,
 sir, I saw every deal, how and in what wise, and therefore,
 sir, how should I suffer in your presence such a felon and
 traitor as Sir Palomides; for I saw him with mine eyes,
 how he beheld you when ye went out of the field.  For
 ever he hoved still upon his horse till he saw you come in
 againward.  And then forthwithal I saw him ride to the
 hurt knight, and changed harness with him, and then
 straight I saw him how he rode into the field.  And anon
 as he had found you he encountered with you, and thus
 wilfully Sir Palomides did battle with you; and as for him,
 sir, I was not greatly afraid, but I dread sore Launcelot,
 that knew you not.  Madam, said Palomides, ye may say
 whatso ye will, I may not contrary you, but by my knighthood
 I knew not Sir Tristram.  Sir Palomides, said Sir
 Tristram, I will take your excuse, but well I wot ye spared
 me but little, but all is pardoned on my part.  Then La
 Beale Isoud held down her head and said no more at that
 time.
