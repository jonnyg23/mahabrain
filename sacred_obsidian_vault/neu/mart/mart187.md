 CHAPTER XXXIV
 
 How Sir Lamorak sent an horn to King Mark in despite of
 Sir Tristram, and how Sir Tristram was driven into a chapel.
 
 So he departed from him with Sir Driant, and by the way they met
 with a knight that was sent from Morgan le Fay unto King Arthur;
 and this knight had a fair horn harnessed with gold, and the horn
 had such a virtue that there might no lady nor gentlewoman drink
 of that horn but if she were true to her husband, and if she were
 false she should spill all the drink, and if she were true to her
 lord she might drink peaceable.  And because of the Queen
 Guenever, and in the despite of Sir Launcelot, this horn was sent
 unto King Arthur; and by force Sir Lamorak made that knight to
 tell all the cause why he bare that horn.  Now shalt thou bear
 this horn, said Lamorak, unto King Mark, or else choose thou to
 die for it; for I tell thee plainly, in despite and reproof of
 Sir Tristram thou shalt bear that horn unto King Mark, his uncle,
 and say thou to him that I sent it him for to assay his lady, and
 if she be true to him he shall prove her.  So the knight went his
 way unto King Mark, and brought him that rich horn, and said that
 Sir Lamorak sent it him, and thereto he told him the virtue of
 that horn.  Then the king made Queen Isoud to drink thereof, and
 an hundred ladies, and there were but four ladies of all those
 that drank clean.  Alas, said King Mark, this is &lt;336&gt;a great
 despite, and sware a great oath that she should be burnt and the
 other ladies.
 
 Then the barons gathered them together, and said plainly they
 would not have those ladies burnt for an horn made by sorcery,
 that came from as false a sorceress and witch as then was living. 
 For that horn did never good, but caused strife and debate, and
 always in her days she had been an enemy to all true lovers.  So
 there were many knights made their avow, an ever they met with
 Morgan le Fay, that they would show her short courtesy.  Also Sir
 Tristram was passing wroth that Sir Lamorak sent that horn unto
 King Mark, for well he knew that it was done in the despite of
 him.  And therefore he thought to quite Sir Lamorak.
 
 Then Sir Tristram used daily and nightly to go to Queen Isoud
 when he might, and ever Sir Andred his cousin watched him night
 and day for to take him with La Beale Isoud.  And so upon a night
 Sir Andred espied the hour and the time when Sir Tristram went to
 his lady.  Then Sir Andred gat unto him twelve knights, and at
 midnight he set upon Sir Tristram secretly and suddenly and there
 Sir Tristram was taken naked abed with La Beale Isoud, and then
 was he bound hand and foot, and so was he kept until day.  And
 then by the assent of King Mark, and of Sir Andred, and of some
 of the barons, Sir Tristram was led unto a chapel that stood upon
 the sea rocks, there for to take his judgment: and so he was led
 bounden with forty knights.  And when Sir Tristram saw that there
 was none other boot but needs that he must die, then said he: 
 Fair lords, remember what I have done for the country of
 Cornwall, and in what jeopardy I have been in for the weal of you
 all; for when I fought for the truage of Cornwall with Sir
 Marhaus, the good knight, I was promised for to be better
 rewarded, when ye all refused to take the battle; therefore, as
 ye be good gentle knights, see me not thus shamefully to die, for
 it is shame to all knighthood thus to see me die; for I dare say,
 said Sir Tristram, that I never met with no knight but I was as
 good as he, or better.  Fie upon thee, said Sir &lt;337&gt;Andred,
 false traitor that thou art, with thine avaunting; for all thy
 boast thou shalt die this day.  O Andred, Andred, said Sir
 Tristram, thou shouldst be my kinsman, and now thou art to me
 full unfriendly, but an there were no more but thou and I, thou
 wouldst not put me to death.  No! said Sir Andred, and therewith
 he drew his sword, and would have slain him.
 
 When Sir Tristram saw him make such countenance he looked upon
 both his hands that were fast bounden unto two knights, and
 suddenly he pulled them both to him, and unwrast his hands, and
 then he leapt unto his cousin, Sir Andred, and wrested his sword
 out of his hands; then he smote Sir Andred that he fell to the
 earth, and so Sir Tristram fought till that he had killed ten
 knights.  So then Sir Tristram gat the chapel and kept it
 mightily.  Then the cry was great, and the people drew fast unto
 Sir Andred, mo than an hundred.  When Sir Tristram saw the people
 draw unto him, he remembered he was naked, and sperd fast the
 chapel door, and brake the bars of a window, and so he leapt out
 and fell upon the crags in the sea.  And so at that time Sir
 Andred nor none of his fellows might get to him, at that time.
