 CHAPTER XII
 
 How Sir Tristram departed from the king and La Beale
 Isoud out of Ireland for to come into Cornwall.
 
 SIR, said Tristram, now I shall tell you all the truth: my
 father's name is Sir Meliodas, King of Liones, and my &lt;298&gt;mother
 hight Elizabeth, that was sister unto King Mark of Cornwall; and
 my mother died of me in the forest, and because thereof she
 commanded, or she died, that when I were christened they should
 christen me Tristram; and because I would not be known in this
 country I turned my name and let me call Tramtrist; and for the
 truage of Cornwall I fought for my eme's sake, and for the right
 of Cornwall that ye had posseded many years.  And wit ye well,
 said Tristram unto the king, I did the battle for the love of
 mine uncle, King Mark, and for the love of the country of
 Cornwall, and for to increase mine honour; for that same day that
 I fought with Sir Marhaus I was made knight, and never or then
 did I battle with no knight, and from me he went alive, and left
 his shield and his sword behind.
 
 So God me help, said the king, I may not say but ye did as a
 knight should, and it was your part to do for your quarrel, and
 to increase your worship as a knight should; howbeit I may not
 maintain you in this country with my worship, unless that I
 should displease my barons, and my wife and her kin.  Sir, said
 Tristram, I thank you of your good lordship that I have had with
 you here, and the great goodness my lady, your daughter, hath
 shewed me, and therefore, said Sir Tristram, it may so happen
 that ye shall win more by my life than by my death, for in the
 parts of England it may happen I may do you service at some
 season, that ye shall be glad that ever ye shewed me your good
 lordship.  With more I promise you as I am true knight, that in
 all places I shall be my lady your daughter's servant and knight
 in right and in wrong, and I shall never fail her, to do as much
 as a knight may do.  Also I beseech your good grace that I may
 take my leave at my lady, your daughter, and at all the barons
 and knights.  I will well, said the king.
 
 Then Sir Tristram went unto La Beale Isoud and took his leave of
 her.  And then he told her all, what he was, and how he had
 changed his name because he would not be known, and how a lady
 told him that he should never be whole till he came into this
 country where the &lt;299&gt;poison was made, wherethrough I was near
 my death had not your ladyship been.  O gentle knight, said La
 Beale
 Isoud, full woe am I of thy departing, for I saw never man that I
 owed so good will to.  And therewithal she wept heartily.  Madam,
 said Sir Tristram, ye shall understand that my name is Sir
 Tristram de Liones, gotten of King Meliodas, and born of his
 queen.  And I promise you faithfully that I shall be all the days
 of my life your knight.  Gramercy, said La Beale Isoud, and I
 promise you there-against that I shall not be married this seven
 years but by your assent; and to whom that ye will I shall be
 married to him will I have, and he will have me if ye will
 consent.
 
 And then Sir Tristram gave her a ring, and she gave him another;
 and therewith he departed from her, leaving her making great dole
 and lamentation; and he straight went unto the court among all
 the barons, and there he took his leave at most and least, and
 openly he said among them all:  Fair lords, now it is so that I
 must depart: if there be any man here that I have offended unto,
 or that any man be with me grieved, let complain him here afore
 me or that ever I depart, and I shall amend it unto my power. 
 And if there be any that will proffer me wrong, or say of me
 wrong or shame behind my back, say it now or never, and here is
 my body to make it good, body against body.  And all they stood
 still, there was not one that would say one word; yet were there
 some knights that were of the queen's blood, and of Sir Marhaus'
 blood, but they would not meddle with him.
