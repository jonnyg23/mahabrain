 CHAPTER LXII
 
 The copy of the letter written for to revenge the king's death,
 and how Sir Palomides fought for to have the battle.
 
 
 RECOMMENDING unto King Arthur and to all his knights
 errant, beseeching them all that insomuch as I, King
 Hermance, King of the Red City, thus am slain by felony
 and treason, through two knights of mine own, and of
 mine own bringing up and of mine own making, that
 some worshipful knight will revenge my death, insomuch
 I have been ever to my power well willing unto Arthur's
 court.  And who that will adventure his life with these
 two traitors for my sake in one battle, I, King Hermance,
 King of the Red City, freely give him all my lands and
 rents that ever I wielded in my life.  This letter, said
 Ebel, I wrote by my lord's commandment, and then he
 received his Creator; and when he was dead, he commanded
 me or ever he were cold to put that letter fast
 in his hand.  And then he commanded me to put forth
 that same vessel down Humber, and I should give these
 mariners in commandment never to stint until that they
 came unto Logris, where all the noble knights shall
 assemble at this time.  And there shall some good knight
 have pity on me to revenge my death, for there was
 never king nor lord falslier nor traitorlier slain than I
 am here to my death.  Thus was the complaint of our
 King Hermance.  Now, said Sir Ebel, ye know all how
 our lord was betrayed, we require you for God's sake
 have pity upon his death, and worshipfully revenge his
 death, and then may ye wield all these lands.  For we all
 wit well that an ye may slay these two traitors, the Red
 City and all those that be therein will take you for their
 lord.
 
 Truly, said Sir Palomides, it grieveth my heart for to
 hear you tell this doleful tale; and to say the truth I saw
 the same letter that ye speak of, and one of the best
 knights on the earth read that letter to me, and by his
 commandment I came hither to revenge your king's death;
 and therefore have done, and let me wit where I shall find
 those traitors, for I shall never be at ease in my heart till
 I be in hands with them.  Sir, said Sir Ebel, then take
 your ship again, and that ship must bring you unto the
 Delectable Isle, fast by the Red City, and we in this castle
 shall pray for you, and abide your again-coming.  For
 this same castle, an ye speed well, must needs be yours;
 for our King Hermance let make this castle for the love
 of the two traitors, and so we kept it with strong hand,
 and therefore full sore are we threated.  Wot ye what ye
 shall do, said Sir Palomides; whatsomever come of me,
 look ye keep well this castle.  For an it misfortune me
 so to be slain in this quest I am sure there will come one
 of the best knights of the world for to revenge my death,
 and that is Sir Tristram de Liones, or else Sir Launcelot
 du Lake.
 
 Then Sir Palomides departed from that castle.  And
 as he came nigh the city, there came out of a ship a
 goodly knight armed against him, with his shield on his
 shoulder, and his hand upon his sword.  And anon as he
 came nigh Sir Palomides he said:  Sir knight, what seek
 ye here? leave this quest for it is mine, and mine it was
 or ever it was yours, and therefore I will have it.  Sir
 knight, said Palomides, it may well be that this quest was
 yours or it was mine, but when the letter was taken out
 of the dead king's hand, at that time by likelihood there
 was no knight had undertaken to revenge the death of
 the king.  And so at that time I promised to revenge his
 death, and so I shall or else I am ashamed.  Ye say well,
 said the knight, but wit ye well then will I fight with you,
 and who be the better knight of us both, let him take the
 battle upon hand.  I assent me, said Sir Palomides.  And
 then they dressed their shields, and pulled out their
 swords, and lashed together many sad strokes as men of
 might; and this fighting was more than an hour, but at
 the last Sir Palomides waxed big and better winded, so
 that then he smote that knight such a stroke that he made
 him to kneel upon his knees.  Then that knight spake on
 high and said:  Gentle knight, hold thy hand.  Sir Palomides
 was goodly and withdrew his hand.  Then this
 knight said:  Wit ye well, knight, that thou art better
 worthy to have this battle than I, and require thee of
 knighthood tell me thy name.  Sir, my name is Palomides,
 a knight of King Arthur's, and of the Table
 Round, that hither I came to revenge the death of this
 dead king.
