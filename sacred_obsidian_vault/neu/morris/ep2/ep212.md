 <p align="center"><i>Gudrun twice Wedded, Widowed, and Wooed of Kiartan</i>.</p>  
 <p>SO wore the time away, nor long it was<br> Ere somewhat of Guest's forecast came to pass.<br> Drawn by her beauty, Thorvald wooed Gudrun;<br> Saying withal that he was such an one<br> As fainer was to wed a wife than lands,<br> Readier by far to give forth from his hands<br> That which he had, than take aught of her kin.<br> And in such wise he did not fail to win<br> His fond desire, and, therewith, wretched life.<br> For she who deemed nought worth so much of strife<br> As to say 'no' for ever, being wed, found<br> How the chain galled whereto she now was bound,<br> And more and more began to look on him<br> With hate that would be scorn, with eyes grown dim<br> With hope of change that came not, and lips set<br> For ever with the stifling of regret.<br> Coarse Thorvald was, and rough and passionate,<br> And little used on change of days to wait;<br> And as she ever Bloomed before his eyes,<br> Rage took the place of the first grieved surprise,<br> Wherewith he found that he who needs must love <a name="page_363"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 363</font></a><br> Could get no love in turn, nay, nor een move<br> Her heart to kindness: then as nothing strange<br> Still with sad loathing looks she took the change<br> She noted in him, as if all were done<br> Between them, and no deed beneath the sun<br> That he could do would now be worse to her.<br>    Judge if the hot heart of the man could bear<br> Such days as these! Upon a time it fell<br> That he, most fain indeed to love her well,<br> Would she but turn to him, had striven sore<br> To gain her love, and yet gat nothing more<br> Than a faint smile of scorn, neath eyes whose gaze<br> Seemed fixed for ever on the hoped-for days,<br> Wherein he no more should have part or lot;<br> Then mingled hate with love in him, and hot<br> His heart grew past all bearing; round about<br> He stared, as one who hears the eager shout<br> Of closing foes, when he to death is brought;<br> In his fierce heart thought crowded upon thought,<br> Till he saw not and heard not, but rose up<br> And cast upon the floor his half-filled cup,<br> And crying out, smote her upon the face;<br> Then strode adown the hushed and crowded place,<br> For meal-time was it, till he reached the door;<br> Then gat his horse, and over hill and moor,<br> Scarce knowing where he went, rode furiously.</p>  
 <p>   But in the hall, folk turned them round to see<br> What thing Gudrun would do, who for a while <a name="page_364"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 364</font></a><br> Sat pale and silent, with a deadly smile<br> Upon her lips; then called to where she sat<br> Folk from the hall, and talked of this and that<br> Gaily, as one who hath no care or pain:<br> Yea, when the goodman gat him back again<br> She met him changed, so that he well-nigh thought<br> That better days his hasty blow had brought.<br> And still as time wore on, day after day<br> Wondering, he saw her seeming blithe and gay;<br> So he, though sore misdoubting him of this,<br> Took what he might of pleasure and of bliss,<br> And put thought back. So time wore till the spring,<br> And then the goodman rode unto the Thing,<br> Not over light of heart, or free from fear,<br> Though his wife's face at parting was all clear<br> Of frown or sullenness; but he being gone,<br> Next morn Gudrun rode with one man alone<br> Forth unto Bathstead; there her tale she told,<br> And as in those days law strained not to hold<br> Folk whom love held not, or some common tie,<br> So her divorce was set forth speedily,<br> For mighty were her kin.<br>                             And now once more<br> At Bathstead did she dwell, free as before,<br> And, smiling, heard of how her husband fared<br> When by the Hill of Laws he stood and heard<br> The words, that he belike half thought to hear,<br> Which took from him a thing once held so dear,<br> That all was nought thereby. <a name="page_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a><br>                                 Now wise ones tell<br> That there was one who used to note her well<br> Within her husband's hall, and many say<br> That talk of love they had before the day<br> That she went back to Bathstead; how that was<br> I know not surely; but it came to pass<br> That scarcely had abated the first rage<br> Of her old mate, and scarce less like a cage<br> Of red-hot iron gan to feel his life,<br> Ere this man, Thord, had won Gudrun to wife;<br> So, since the man was brisk and brave and fair,<br> And she had known him when her days were drear,<br> And turned with hope and longing to his eyes,<br> Kind amid hard things, in most joyous wise<br> Their-life went, and she deemed she loved him well;<br> And the strange things that Guest did once foretell,<br> Which morn and noon and eve she used to set<br> Before her eyes, she now would fain forget;<br> Alas! forgotten or remembered, still<br> Midst joy or sorrow fate shall work its will;<br> Three months they lived in joy and peace enow,<br> Till on a June night did the south-west blow<br> The rainy rack oer Gudrun's sleeping head,<br> While in the firth was rolled her husband dead<br> Toward the black cliffs; drowned was he, says my tale,<br> By wizard's spells amidst a summer gale.</p>  
 <p>   Then back to Bathstead Gudrun came again,<br> To sit with fierce heart brooding oer her pain, <a name="page_366"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 366</font></a><br> While life and time seemed made to torture her,<br> That she the utmost of all pain might bear,<br> To please she knew not whom; and yet mid this,<br> And all her raging for the vanished bliss,<br> Would Guest's words float up to her memory,<br> And quicken cold life; then would she cast by<br> As something vile the comfort that they brought,<br> Yet, none the less, still stronger grew that thought,<br> Unheeded, and unchidden therefore, round<br> The weary wall of woe, her life that bound.</p>  
 <p>   So wore the months; spring with its longings came,<br> And now in every mouth was Kiartan's name,<br> And daily now must Gudrun's dull ears bear<br> Tales of the prowess of his youth to hear,<br> While in his cairn forgotten lay her love.<br> For this man, said they, all men's hearts did move,<br> Nor yet might envy cling to such an one,<br> So far beyond all dwellers neath the sun;<br> Great was he, yet so fair of face and limb<br> That all folk wondered much, beholding him,<br> How such a man could be; no fear he knew,<br> And all in manly deeds he could outdo;<br> Fleet-foot, a swimmer strong, an archer good,<br> Keen-eyed to know the dark waves' changing mood;<br> Sure on the crag, and with the sword so skilled,<br> That when he played therewith the air seemed filled<br> With light of gleaming blades; therewith was he<br> Of noble speech, though says not certainly <a name="page_367"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 367</font></a><br> My tale, that aught of his be left behind<br> With rhyme and measure deftly intertwined;<br> Well skilled was he, too, in the craftsman's lore<br> To deal with iron mid the stithy's roar,<br> And many a sword-blade knew his heavy hand.<br> Shortly, if he amid ten kings should stand,<br> All men would think him worthier man than they;<br> And yet withal it was his daily way<br> To be most gentle both of word and deed,<br> And ever folk would seek him in their need,<br> Nor was there any child but loved him well.</p>  
 <p>   Such things about him ever would men tell,<br> Until their hearts swelled in them as they thought<br> How great a glory to their land was brought,<br> Seeing that this man was theirs. Such love and praise<br> Kiartan's beginning had in those fair days,<br> While Gudrun sat sick-eyed, and hearkened this,<br> Still brooding on the late-passed days of bliss,<br> And thinking still how worthless such things were.</p>  
 <p>   But now when midsummer was drawing near,<br> As on an eve folk sat within the hall,<br> Man unto man far off did they hear call,<br> And then the sound of horse-hoofs; Oswif rose,<br> And went into the porch to look for those<br> Who might be coming, and at last folk heard,<br> Close to the porch, the new-come travellers word,<br> And turned to meet them; Gudrun sat alone <a name="page_368"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 368</font></a><br> High on the dais when all folk were gone,<br> And playing with her golden finger-rings,<br> Set all her heart to think of bygone things,<br> Till hateful seemed all hopes, all thoughts of men.</p>  
 <p>   Yet did she turn unto their voices, when<br> Folk back again into the hall did crowd,<br> Torch-litten now, laughing and talking loud,<br> Then as the guests adown the long hall drew,<br> Olaf the Peacock presently she knew,<br> Hand in hand with her father; but behind<br> Came two young men; then rose up to her mind,<br> Against her will, the tales of Kiartan told,<br> Because she deemed the one, whose hair of gold<br> In the new torch-light gleamed, was even he,<br> And that the black-haired high-browed one must be<br> Bodli, the son of Thorleik; but with that<br> Up to the place where listlessly she sat,<br> They came, and on her feet she now must stand<br> To welcome them; then Olaf took her hand,<br> And looked on her with eyes compassionate,<br> And said:<br>            "O Gudrun, ill has been thy fate,<br> But surely better days shall soon be thine,<br> For not for nought do eyes like thine eyes shine<br> Upon the hard world; thou shalt bless us yet<br> In many a wise and all thy woes forget."   </p>  
 <p>She answered nought, but drew her hand away, <a name="page_369"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 369</font></a><br> And heavier yet the weight upon her lay<br> That thus men spake of her. But, turning round,<br> Kiartan upon the other hand she found,<br> Gazing upon her with wide hungry eyes<br> And parted lips; then did strange joy surprise<br> Her listless heart, and changed her old world was;<br> Ere she had time to think, all woe did pass<br> Away from her, and all her life grew sweet,<br> And scarce she felt the ground beneath her feet,<br> Or knew who stood around, or in what place<br> Of heaven or earth she was; soft grew her face;<br> In tears that fell not yet, her eyes did swim,<br> As, trembling, she reached forth her hand to him,<br> And with the shame of love her smooth cheeks burned,<br> And her lips quivered, as if sore they yearned<br> For words they had not learned, and might not know<br> Till night and loneliness their form should show.</p>  
 <p>   But Kiartan's face a happy smile did light,<br> Kind, loving, confident; good hap and might<br> Seemed in his voice as now he spake, and said:<br> "They say the dead for thee will neer be dead,<br> And on this eve I thought in sooth to have<br> Labour enow to draw thee from the grave<br> Of the old days; but thou rememberest,<br> Belike, days earlier yet, that men call best<br> Of all days, when as younglings erst we met.<br> Thou thinkest now thou never didst forget <a name="page_370"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 370</font></a><br> This face of mine, since now most certainly<br> The eyes are kind wherewith thou lookst on me."   </p>  
 <p>A shade came oer her face, but quickly passed,<br> "Yea," said she, "if such pleasant days might last,<br> As when we wandered laughing hand in hand<br> Along the borders of the shell-strewn strand."</p>  
 <p>   She wondered at the sound of her own voice,<br> She chid her heart that it must needs rejoice,<br> She marvelled why her soul with fear was filled;<br> But quickly every questioning was stilled<br> As he sat down by her.<br>                         Old Oswif smiled<br> To see her sorrow in such wise beguiled,<br> And Olaf laughed for joy, and many a thought<br> Of happy loves to Bodli's heart was brought<br> As by his friend he sat, and saw his face<br> So bright with bliss; and all the merry place<br> Ran over with goodwill that sight to see,<br> And the hours passed in great festivity.<br>    At last beneath the glimmer of the moon,<br> Fanned by the soft sea-wind that tempers June,<br> Homeward they rode, sire, son and foster-son,<br> Kiartan half joyful that the eve was done,<br> And he had leisure for himself to weave<br> Tales of the joyful way that from that eve<br> Should lead to perfect bliss; Bodli no less<br> Rejoicing in his fellow's happiness, <a name="page_371"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 371</font></a><br> Dreaming of such-like joy to come to him,<br> And Olaf, thinking how that nowise dim<br> The glory of his line through these should grow.</p>  
 <p>   But while in peace these through the night did go,<br> Vexed by new thoughts and old thoughts, Gudrun lay<br> Upon her bed: she watched him go away,<br> And her heart sank within her, and there came,<br> With pain of that departing, pity and shame,<br> That struggling with her love yet made it strong,<br> That called her longing blind, yet made her long<br> Yet more for more desire, what seeds soeer<br> Of sorrow hate and ill were hidden there.<br> So with her strong heart wrestled love, till she<br> Sank neath the hand of sleep, and quietly<br> Beneath the new-risen sun she lay at rest,<br> The bed-gear fallen away from her white breast,<br> "One arm deep buried in her hair, one spread<br> Abroad, across the broideries of the bed,<br> A smile upon her lips, and yet a tear,<br> Scarce dry, but stayed anigh her dainty ear<br> How fair, how soft, how kind she seemed that morn,<br> Ere she anew to love and life was born.</p>  
 <p>   A little space to part these twain indeed<br> Was seven short miles of hill and moor and mead,<br> And soon the threshold of the Bathstead hall<br> Knew nigh as much of Kiartan's firm footfall<br> As of the sweep of Gudrun's kirtle-hem, <a name="page_372"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 372</font></a><br> And sweet past words to tell life grew to them;<br> Sweet the awaking in the morn, when lay<br> Below the hall the narrow winding way,<br> The friend that led, the foe that kept apart;<br> And sweet the joyful flutter of the heart<br> Anigh the door, ere clinging memory<br> Gave place to rapturous sight, and eye met eye;<br> Sweet the long hours of converse when each word<br> Like fairest music still seemed doubly heard,<br> Caught by the ear and clung to by the heart;<br> Yea, even most sweet the minute they must part,<br> Because the veil, that so oft time must draw<br> Before them, fell, and clear without a flaw,<br> Their hearts saw love, that moment they did stand<br> Ere lip left lip, or hand fell down from hand;<br> Yea, that passed oer, still sweet and bitter sweet<br> The yearning pain that stayed the lingering feet<br> Upon the threshold, and the homeward way;<br> And silent chamber covered up from day<br> For thoughts of words unsaidah, sweet the night<br> Amidst its dreams of manifold delight!</p>  
 <p>   And yet sometimes pangs of perplexed pain<br> Would torture Gudrun, as she thought again<br> On Guest and his forecasting of her dream;<br> And through the dark of days to come would gleam<br> .Fear, like a flame of hell shot suddenly<br> Up through spring meadows twixt fair tree and tree,<br> Though little might she see the flaws, whereof <a name="page_373"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 373</font></a><br> That past dream warned her, midst her dream of love;<br> And whatso things her eyes refused to see,<br> Made wise by fear, none others certainly<br> Might see in love so seeming smooth as this,<br> That looked to all men like the door of bliss<br> Unto the twain, and to the country-side<br> Good hope and joy, that thus so fast were tied<br> The bonds twixt two such houses as were these,<br> And folk before them saw long years of peace.</p>  
 <p>   Of Bodli Thorleikson the story says,<br> That he, oershadowed still by Kiartan's praise,<br> Was second but to him; although, indeed,<br> He, who perchance the love of men did need<br> More than his fellow, less their hearts might move;<br> Yet fair to all men seemed the trust and love<br> Between the friends, and fairer unto none<br> Than unto Olaf, who scarce loved his son<br> More than his brother's son; now seemed it too,<br> That this new love closer the kinsmen drew<br> Than een before, and whatso either did<br> The other knew, and scarce their thoughts seemed hid,<br> One from the other.<br>                        So as day by day<br> Went Kiartan unto Bathstead, still the way<br> Seemed shorter if his friend beside him rode;<br> Then might he ease his soul of that great load<br> Of love unsatisfied, by words, and take<br> Mockeries in turn, grown sweet for that name's sake <a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 374</font></a><br> They wrapped about, or glow with joy to hear<br> The praises of the heart he held so dear,<br> And laugh with joy and pleasure of his life,<br> To note how Bodli's heart withal, seemed rife<br> With love that his love kindled, though as yet<br> It wandered, on no heart of woman set.<br> So Bodli, nothing loth, went many a day,<br> Whenso they would, to make the lovers gay,<br> Whenso they would, to get him gone, that these<br> Een with such yearning words their souls might please<br> As must be spoken, but sound folly still<br> To aught but twain, because no tongue hath skill<br> To tell their meaning: kinder, Kiartan deemed,<br> Grew Bodli day by day, and ever seemed<br> Well-nigh as happy as the loving twain,<br> And unto Bodli life seemed nought but gain,<br> And fair the days were.<br>                             On a day it fell<br> As the three talked, they gan in sport to tell<br> The names oer of such women good and fair,<br> As in the land that tide unwedded were,<br> Naming a mate for Bodli, and still he<br> Must laugh and shake his head;<br>                                "Then over sea,"<br> Quoth Kiartan, "mayhap such an one there is<br> That thou mayst deem the getting of her bliss;<br> Go forth and win her with the rover's sword!"</p>  
 <p>   Then Bodli laughed, and cast upon the board <a name="page_375"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 375</font></a><br> The great grey blade and ponderous iron hilt,<br> All unadorned, the yoke-fellow of guilt,<br> And said, "Go, sword, and fetch me home a bride!<br> But here in Iceland have I will to bide<br> With those that love me, till the fair days change."</p>  
 <p>   Then Gudrun said, "Things have there been more strange,<br> Than that we three should sit above the oars,<br> The while on even keel twixt the low shores<br> Our long-ship breasts the Thames flood, or the Seine.<br> Methinks in biding here is little gain,<br> Cooped up in this cold corner of the world."</p>  
 <p>   Then up sprang Kiartan, seized the sword, and hurled<br> Its weight aloft, and caught it by the hilt<br> As down it fell, and cried, "Would that the tilt<br> Were even now being rigged above the ship!<br> Would that we stood to see the oars first dip<br> In the green waves! nay, rather would that we<br> Above the bulwarks now saw Italy,<br> With all its beacons flaring! Sheathe thy sword,<br> Fair foster-brother, till I say the word<br> That draws it forth; and, Gudrun, never fear<br> That thou a word or twain of me shalt hear,<br> Een if the birds must bear them oer the sea."</p>  
 <p>   Her eyes were fixed upon him lovingly<br> As thus he spake, and Bodli smiling saw <a name="page_376"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 376</font></a><br> Her hand to Kiartan's ever nigher draw;<br> Then he rose up and sheathed the sword, and said,<br> "Nay, rather if I be so hard to wed,<br> I yet must think of roving, so I go<br> To talk to Oswif, all the truth to know<br> About the news the chapmen carried here,<br> That Olaf Tryggvison his sword doth rear<br> Gainst Hacon and his fortune."<br>                                     Therewithal<br> He laughed, and gat him swiftly from the hall,<br> And found the old man, nor came back again<br> Until through sun and shadow had the twain<br> Sat long together, and the hall gan fill.<br> Then did he deem his friend sat somewhat still,<br> And something strange he saw in Gudrun's eyes<br> As she gazed on him; nor did fail to rise<br> In his own heart the shadow of a shade,<br> That made him deem the world less nobly made,<br> And yet was like to pleasure. On the way<br> Back home again, not much did Kiartan say,<br> And what he spake was well-nigh mockery<br> Of speech, wherewith he had been wont to free<br> His heart from longings grown too sweet to bear.<br> But time went on, and still the days did wear<br> With little seeming change; if love grew cold<br> In Kiartan's heart one day, the next oer bold,<br> Oer frank, he noted not who might be by,<br> When he unto his love was drawing nigh;<br> Gudrun gloomed not; as merry as before <a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 377</font></a><br> Did Bodli come and go twixt dais and door.<br> Only perchance a little oftener they<br> Fell upon talk of the fair lands that lay<br> Across the seas, and sometimes would a look<br> Cross Gudrun's face that seemed a half rebuke<br> To Kiartan, as all over-eagerly<br> He talked about the life beyond the sea,<br> As thereof he had heard the stories tell.<br> Then Bodli sometimes into musings fell,<br> So dreamlike, that he might not tell his thought<br> When he again to common life was brought.</p>  
 <p>   So passed the seasons, but in autumn-tide<br> The foster-brothers did to Burgfirth ride,<br> Unto a ship new come to White-river;<br> Talk with the outland chapmen had they there,<br> And Kiartan bade the captain in the end<br> p Back unto Herdholt as his guest to wend,<br> And nothing loth he went with him; and now<br> Great tidings thereupon began to show<br> Of Hacon slain, his son thrust from the land,<br> And Norway in fair peace beneath the hand<br> Of Olaf Tryggvison; nor did he fail<br> To tell about the king full many a tale,<br> And praise him for the noblest man, that eer<br> Had held the tiller, or cast forth the spear:<br> And Kiartan listened eagerly, yet seemed<br> As if amid the tale he well-nigh dreamed;<br> And now withal, when he to Bathstead went, <a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 378</font></a><br> Less than before would talk of his intent<br> To see the outlands, to his listening love;<br> And when at whiles she spake to him thereof<br> Lightly he answered her, and smile or kiss<br> Would change their talk to idle words of bliss:<br> Less of her too to Bodli now he spake,<br> Although this other, (for her beauty's sake<br> He told himself) to hear of her was fain;<br> And he, for his part, sometimes felt a pain,<br> As though the times were changing over fast,<br> When Kiartan let the word of his go past<br> Unnoted, that in other days belike<br> Had nowise failed from out his heart to strike<br> The sparks of lovesome praise.<br>                                  But now Yule-tide<br> Was come at last, and folk from far and wide<br> Went to their neighbours' feasts, and as wont was<br> All Bathstead unto Herdholt hall did pass,<br> And the feast lasted long, and all folk gat<br> Things that their souls desired, and Gudrun sat<br> In the high-seat beside the goodwife there.</p>  
 <p>   But ever now her wary ears did hear<br> The new king's name bandied from mouth to mouth,<br> And talk of those new-corners from the south;<br> And through her anxious heart a sharp pain smote<br> As Kiartan's face she eagerly gan note<br> And sighed; because, leaned forward on the board,<br> He sat, with eager face hearkening each word, <a name="page_379"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 379</font></a><br> Nor speaking aught; then long with hungry eyes<br> She sat regarding him, nor yet would rise<br> A word unto her lips: and all the while<br> Bodli gazed on them with a fading smile<br> About his lips, and eyes that ever grew<br> More troubled still, until he hardly knew<br> What folk were round about.<br>                               So passed away<br> Yule-tide at Herdholt, cold day following day,<br> Till spring was gone, and Gudrun had not failed<br> To win both many days where joy prevailed,<br> And many a pang of fear; till so it fell<br> That in the summer, whereof now we tell,<br> Upon a day in blithe mood Kiartan came<br> To Bathstead, not as one who looks for blame,<br> And Bodli with him, sad-eyed, silent, dull,<br> Noted of Gudrun, who no less was full<br> Of merry talk, yea, more than her wont was.<br> But as the hours toward eventide did pass,<br> Said Kiartan:<br>                 "Love, make we the most of bliss,<br> For though, indeed, not the last day this is<br> Whereon we twain shall meet in such a wise,<br> Yet shalt thou see me soon in fighting guise,<br> And hear the horns blow up our <i>Loth to go</i>,<br> For in White-River"<br>                           "Is it even so,"<br> She broke in, "that these feet abide behind?<br> Men call me hard, but thou hast known me kind; <a name="page_380"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 380</font></a><br> Men call me fair, my body give I thee;<br> Men call me dainty, let the rough salt sea<br> Deal with me as it will, so thou be near!<br> Let me share glory with thee, and take fear<br> That thy heart throws aside!"<br>                              Hand joined to hand,<br> As one who prays, and trembling, did she stand<br> With parted lips, and pale and weary-faced.<br> But up and down the hall-floor Bodli paced<br> With clanking sword, and brows set in a frown,<br> And scarce less pale than she. The sun low down<br> Shone through the narrow windows of the hall,<br> And on the gold upon her breast did fall,<br> And gilt her slim clasped hands.<br>                                  There Kiartan stood<br> Gazing upon her in strange wavering mood,<br> Now longing sore to clasp her to his heart,<br> And pray her, too, that they might neer depart,<br> Now well-nigh ready to say such a word<br> As cutteth love across as with a sword;<br> So fought love in him with the craving vain<br> The love of all the wondering world to gain,<br> Though such he named it not. And so at last<br> His eyes upon the pavement did he cast,<br> And knit his brow as though some word to say;<br> Then fell her outstretched hands, she cried:<br>                                           "Nay, nay!<br> Thou needst not speak, I will not ask thee twice<br> To take a gift, a good gift, and be wise; <a name="page_381"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 381</font></a><br> I know my heart, thou knowst it not; farewell,<br> Maybe that other tales the Skalds shall tell<br> Than of thy great deeds."<br>                            Still her face was pale,<br> As with a sound betwixt a sigh and wail,<br> She brushed by Bodli, who, aghast, did stand<br> With open mouth, and vainly stretched-out hand;<br> But Kiartan followed her a step or two,<br> Then stayed, bewildered by his sudden woe;<br> But even therewith, as nigh the door she was,<br> She turned back suddenly, and straight did pass,<br> Trembling all over, to his side, and said,<br> With streaming eyes:<br>                     "Let not my words be weighed<br> As a man's words are! O, fair love, go forth<br> And come thou back again, made no more worth<br> Unto this heart; but worthier it may be<br> To the dull world thy worth that cannot see.<br> Go forth, and let the rumour of thee run<br> Through every land that is beneath the sun;<br> For know I not, indeed, that everything<br> Thou winnest at the hands of lord or king,<br> Is surely mine, as thou art mine at last?"</p>  
 <p>   Then round about his neck her arms she cast,<br> And wept right sore, and touched with love and shame,<br> Must Kiartan offer to leave hope of fame,<br> And noble life; but midst her tears she smiled, <a name="page_382"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 382</font></a><br> "Go forth, my love, and be thou not beguiled<br> By woman's tears, I spake but as a fool,<br> We of the north wrap not our men in wool,<br> Lest they should die at last; nay, be not moved,<br> To think that thou a faint-heart fool hast loved!"</p>  
 <p>   For now his tears fell too, he said: "My sweet,<br> Ere the ship sails we yet again shall meet<br> To say farewell, a little while, and then,<br> When I come back to hold my place mid men,<br> With honour won for theehow fair it is<br> To think on now, the sweetness and the bliss!"</p>  
 <p>   Some little words she said no pen could write,<br> Upon his face she laid her fingers white,<br> And, midst of kisses, with his hair did play;<br> Then, smiling through her tears, she went away.<br> Nor heeded Bodli aught<br>                         Men say the twain,<br> Kiartan and Gudrun, never met again<br> In loving wise; that each to each no more<br> Their eyes looked kind on this side death's dark shore,<br> That midst their tangled life they must forget,<br> Till they were dead, that ere their lips had met.</p>  
 <p>   For ere the day that Kiartan meant to come<br> And kiss his love once more within her home,<br> The south-east wind, that had stayed hitherto<br> Their sailing, changed, and northwest now it blew; <a name="page_383"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 383</font></a><br> And Kálf, the captain, urged them to set forth,<br> Because that tide the wind loved not the north,<br> And now the year grew late for long delay.<br> Night was it when he spake; at dawn next day,<br> Before the door at Herdholt might men see,<br> Armed, and in saddle, a goodly company.<br> Kiartan, bright-eyed and flushed, restless withal,<br> As on familiar things his eyes did fall,<br> Yet eager to be gone, and smiling still,<br> For pride and hope and love his soul did fill,<br> As of his coming life he thought, and saw<br> In all the days that were to be, no flaw.<br> About him were his fellows, ten such men<br> As in the land had got no equals then;<br> By him his foster-brother sat, as true<br> As was the steel the rover's hand erst drew;<br> There stood his father, flushed with joy and pride,<br> By the fair-carven door that did abide,<br> Till he fulfilled of glory came again<br> To take his bride before the eyes of men.</p>  
 <p>   Now skipper Kálf, clad in the Peacock's gift,<br> Unto the south his gold-wrought spear did lift,<br> And Kiartan stooped and kissed his sire. A shout<br> Rose from the home-men, as they turned about,<br> And trotted jingling down the grassy knoll.<br> Silent awhile rode Kiartan, till his soul,<br> Filled with a many thoughts, in speech oerflowed,<br> And unto Bodli, who beside him rode, <a name="page_384"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 384</font></a><br> He fell to talk of all that they should do<br> In the fair countries that they journeyed to.<br> Not Norway only, or the western lands,<br> In time to come, he said, might know their hands,<br> But fairer places, folk of greater fame,<br> Where neath the shadow of the Roman name<br> Sat the Greek king, gold-clad, with bloodless sword.<br> But as he spoke Bodli said here a word<br> And there a word, and knew not what he said,<br> Nay, scarcely knew what wild thoughts filled his head,<br> What longings burned, like a still quickening flame,<br> Within his sad heart.<br>                        So that night they came<br> To Burg-firth and the place upon the strand<br> Where by the ready ship the tents did stand,<br> And there they made good cheer, and slept that night,<br> But on the morrow, with the earliest light,<br> They gat a ship-board, and, all things being done,<br> Upon a day when low clouds hid the sun,<br> And neath the harsh north-west down drave the rain,<br> They drew the gangway to the ship again,<br> And ran the oars out. There did Kiartan stand<br> By Kálf, who took the tiller in his hand<br> And conned the rising bows; but when at last<br> Toward the grey sky the wet oar-blades were cast,<br> And space twixt stern and land gan widen now,<br> Kiartan cried out and ran forth to the prow,<br> While rope and block yet beat confusedly,<br> And shook his drawn sword oer the dark grey sea; <a name="page_385"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 385</font></a><br> And step for step behind him Bodli went,<br> And on his sword-hilt, with a like intent,<br> He laid his hand, and half drew from its sheath<br> The rover's sword; then with a deep-drawn breath,<br> Most like a sigh, he thrust it back again,<br> His face seemed sharpened with a sudden pain.<br> He turned him round the driving scud to face,<br> His breast heaved, and he staggered in his place,<br> And stretched his strong arms forth with a low moan<br> Unto the hidden hills, neath which alone<br> Sat Gudrunsat his loveand therewithal<br> Down did the bows into the black trough fall,<br> Up rose the oar-song, through the waters grey,<br> Unto the south the good ship took her way.</p>
