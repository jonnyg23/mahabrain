 <p><a name="page_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">THE WRITING ON THE IMAGE.</h3>  <h4 align="center">ARGUMENT.</h4>  
 <p><font size="-1">How on an Image that stood anciently in Rome were written certain words, which none understood, until a Scholar, coming there, knew their meaning, and thereby discovered great marvels, but withal died miserably.</font></p>  
 <p>IN half-forgotten days of old,<br> As by our fathers we were told,<br> Within the town of Rome there stood<br> An image cut of cornel wood,<br> And on the upraised hand of it<br> Men might behold these letters writ<br> "PERCUTE HIC:" which is to say,<br> In that tongue that we speak to-day,<br> "<i>Strike here!</i>" nor yet did any know<br> The cause why this was written so.</p>  
 <p>   Thus in the middle of the square,<br> In the hot sun and summer air,<br> The snow-drift and the driving rain,<br> That image stood, with little pain,<br> For twice a hundred years and ten; <a name="page_441"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 441</font></a><br> While many a band of striving men<br> Were driven betwixt woe and mirth<br> Swiftly across the weary earth,<br> From nothing unto dark nothing:<br> And many an Emperor and King,<br> Passing with glory or with shame,<br> Left little record of his name,<br> And no remembrance of the face<br> Once watched with awe for gifts or grace.<br>    Fear little, then, I counsel you,<br> What any son of man can do;<br> Because a log of wood will last<br> While many a life of man goes past,<br> And all is over in short space.</p>  
 <p>   Now so it chanced that to this place<br> There came a man of Sicily,<br> Who when the image he did see,<br> Knew full well who, in days of yore,<br> Had set it there; for much strange lore,<br> In Egypt and in Babylon,<br> This man with painful toil had won;<br> And many secret things could do;<br> So verily full well he knew<br> That master of all sorcery<br> Who wrought the thing in days gone by,<br> And doubted not that some great spell<br> It guarded, but could nowise tell<br> What it might be. So, day by day, <a name="page_442"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 442</font></a><br> Still would he loiter on the way,<br> And watch the image carefully,<br> Well mocked of many a passer-by.<br>    And on a day he stood and gazed<br> Upon the slender finger, raised<br> Against a doubtful cloudy sky,<br> Nigh noontide; and thought, "Certainly<br> The master who made thee so fair<br> By wondrous art, had not stopped there,<br> But made thee speak, had he not thought<br> That thereby evil might be brought<br> Upon his spell." But as he spoke,<br> From out a cloud the noon sun broke<br> With watery light, and shadows cold<br> Then did the Scholar well behold<br> How, from that finger carved to tell<br> Those words, a short black shadow fell<br> Upon a certain spot of ground,<br> And thereon, looking all around<br> And seeing none heeding, went straightway<br> Whereas the finger's shadow lay,<br> And with his knife about the place<br> A little circle did he trace;<br> Then home he turned with throbbing head,<br> And forthright gat him to his bed,<br> And slept until the night was late<br> And few men stirred from gate to gate.<br>    So when at midnight he did wake,<br> Pickaxe and shovel did he take, <a name="page_443"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 443</font></a><br> And, going to that now silent square,<br> He found the mark his knife made there,<br> And quietly with many a stroke<br> The pavement of the place he broke:<br> And so, the stones being set apart,<br> He gan to dig with beating heart,<br> And from the hole in haste he cast<br> The marl and gravel; till at last,<br> Full shoulder high, his arms were jarred,<br> For suddenly his spade struck hard<br> With clang against some metal thing:<br> And soon he found a brazen ring,<br> All green with rust, twisted, and great<br> As a man's wrist, set in a plate<br> Of copper, wrought all curiously<br> With words unknown though plain to see,<br> Spite of the rust; and flowering trees,<br> And beasts, and wicked images,<br> Whereat he shuddered: for he knew<br> What ill things he might come to do,<br> If he should still take part with these<br> And that Great Master strive to please.<br>    But small time had he then to stand<br> And think, so straight he set his hand<br> Unto the ring, but where he thought<br> That by main strength it must be brought<br> From out its place, to! easily<br> It came away, and let him see<br> A winding staircase wrought of stone,<a name="page_444"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 444</font></a><br> Wherethrough the new-come wind did moan.<br>    Then thought he, "If I come alive<br> From out this place well shall I thrive,<br> For I may look here certainly<br> The treasures of a king to see,<br> A mightier man than men are now.<br> So in few days what man shall know<br> The needy Scholar, seeing me<br> Great in the place where great men be,<br> The richest man in all the land?<br> Beside the best then shall I stand,<br> And some unheard-of palace have;<br> And if my soul I may not save<br> In heaven, yet here in all men's eyes<br> Will I make some sweet paradise,<br> With marble cloisters, and with trees<br> And bubbling wells, and fantasies,<br> And things all men deem strange and rare,<br> And crowds of women kind and fair,<br> That I may see, if so I please,<br> Laid on the flowers, or mid the trees<br> With half-clad bodies wandering.<br> There, dwelling happier than the king.<br> What lovely days may yet be mine!<br> How shall I live with love and wine,<br> And music, till I come to die!<br> And thenWho knoweth certainly<br> What haps to us when we are dead?<br> Truly I think by likelihead <a name="page_445"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 445</font></a><br> Nought haps to us of good or bad;<br> Therefore on earth will I be glad<br> A short space, free from hope or fear;<br> And fearless will I enter here<br> And meet my fate, whatso it be."</p>  
 <p>   Now on his back a bag had he,<br> To bear what treasure he might win,<br> And therewith now did he begin<br> To go adown the winding stair;<br> And found the walls all painted fair<br> With images of many a thing,<br> Warrior and priest, and queen and king,<br> But nothing knew what they might be.<br> Which things full clearly could he see,<br> For lamps were hung up here and there<br> Of strange device, but wrought right fair,<br> And pleasant savour came from them.<br>    At last a curtain, on whose hem<br> Unknown words in red gold were writ,<br> He reached, and softly raising it<br> Stepped back, for now did he behold<br> A goodly hall hung round with gold,<br> And at the upper end could see<br> Sitting, a glorious company:<br> Therefore he trembled, thinking well<br> They were no men, but fiends of hell.<br> But while he waited, trembling sore,<br> And doubtful of his late-learned lore, <a name="page_446"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 446</font></a><br> A cold blast of the outer air<br> Blew out the lamps upon the stair<br> And all was dark behind him; then<br> Did he fear less to face those men<br> Than, turning round, to leave them there<br> While he went groping up the stair.<br> Yea, since he heard no cry or call<br> Or any speech from them at all,<br> He doubted they were images<br> Set there some dying king to please<br> By that Great Master of the art;<br> Therefore at last with stouter heart<br> He raised the cloth and entered in<br> In hope that happy life to win,<br> And drawing nigher did behold<br> That these were bodies dead and cold<br> Attired in full royal guise,<br> And wrought by art in such a wise<br> That living they all seemed to be,<br> Whose very eyes he well could see,<br> That now beheld not foul or fair,<br> Shining as though alive they were.<br> And midmost of that company<br> An ancient king that man could see,<br> A mighty man, whose beard of grey<br> A foot over his gold gown lay;<br> And next beside him sat his queen<br> Who in a flowery gown of green<br> And golden mantle well was clad, <a name="page_447"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 447</font></a><br> And on her neck a collar had<br> Too heavy for her dainty breast;<br> Her loins by such a belt were prest<br> That whoso in his treasury<br> Held that alone, a king might be.<br> On either side of these, a lord<br> Stood heedfully before the board,<br> And in their hands held bread and wine<br> For service; behind these did shine<br> The armour of the guards, and then<br> The well-attired serving-men,<br> The minstrels clad in raiment meet;<br> And over against the royal seat<br> Was hung a lamp, although no flame<br> Was burning there, but there was set<br> Within its open golden fret<br> A huge carbuncle, red and bright;<br> Wherefrom there shone forth such a light<br> That great hall was as clear by it,<br> As though by wax it had been lit,<br> As some great church at Easter-tide.<br>    Now set a little way aside,<br> Six paces from the dais stood<br> An image made of brass and wood,<br> In likeness of a full armed knight<br> Who pointed gainst the ruddy light<br> A huge shaft ready in a bow.<br>    Pondering how he could come to know<br> What all these marvellous matters meant, <a name="page_448"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 448</font></a><br> About the hall the scholar went,<br> Trembling, though nothing moved as yet;<br> And for awhile did he forget<br> The longings that had brought him there<br> In wondering at these marvels fair;<br> And still for fear he doubted much<br> One jewel of their robes to touch.</p>  
 <p>   But as about the hall he passed<br> He grew more used to them at last,<br> And thought, "Swiftly the time goes by,<br> And now no doubt the day draws nigh<br> Folk will be stirring: by my head<br> A fool I am to fear the dead,<br> Who have seen living things enow,<br> Whose very names no man can know,<br> Whose shapes brave men might well affright<br> More than the lion in the night<br> Wandering for food;" therewith he drew<br> Unto those royal corpses two,<br> That on dead brows still wore the crown;<br> And midst the golden cups set down<br> The rugged wallet from his back,<br> Patched of strong leather, brown and black.<br> Then, opening wide its mouth, took up<br> From off the board, a golden cup<br> The King's dead hand was laid upon,<br> Whose unmoved eyes upon him shone<br> And recked no more of that last shame <a name="page_449"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 449</font></a><br> Than if he were the beggar lame,<br> Who in old days was wont to wait<br> For a dog's meal beside the gate.<br>    Of which shame nought our man did reck,<br> But laid his hand upon the neck<br> Of the slim Queen, and thence undid<br> The jewelled collar, that straight slid<br> Down her smooth bosom to the board.<br> And when these matters he had stored<br> Safe in his sack, with both their crowns,<br> The jewelled parts of their rich gowns,<br> Their shoes and belts, brooches and rings,<br> And cleared the board of all rich things,<br> He staggered with them down the hall..<br> But as he went his eyes did fall<br> Upon a wonderful green stone,<br> Upon the hall-floor laid alone;<br> He said, "Though thou art not so great<br> To add by much unto the weight<br> Of this my sack indeed, yet thou,<br> Certes, would make me rich enow,<br> That verily with thee I might<br> Wage one-half of the world to fight<br> The other half of it, and I<br> The lord of all the world might die;<br> I will not leave thee;" therewithal<br> He knelt down midmost of the hall,<br> Thinking it would come easily<br> Into his hand; but when that he <a name="page_450"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 450</font></a><br> Gat hold of it, full fast it stack,<br> So fuming, down he laid his sack,<br> And with both hands pulled lustily,<br> But as he strained, he cast his eye<br> Unto the daïs, and saw there<br> The image who the great bow bare<br> Moving the bowstring to his ear,<br> So, shrieking out aloud for fear,<br> Of that rich stone he loosed his hold<br> And catching up his bag of gold,<br> Gat to his feet: but ere he stood<br> The evil thing of brass and wood<br> Up to his ear the notches drew;<br> And clanging forth the arrow flew,<br> And midmost of the carbuncle<br> Clanging again, the forked barbs fell,<br> And all was dark as pitch straightway.</p>  
 <p>   So there until the judgment day<br> Shall come and find his bones laid low,<br> And raise them up for weal or woe,<br> This man must bide; cast down he lay<br> While all his past life day by day<br> In one short moment he could see<br> Laid out before him, while that he<br> In terror by that fatal stone<br> Was laid, and scarcely dared to moan.<br> But in a while his hope returned,<br> And then, though nothing he discerned, <a name="page_451"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 451</font></a><br> He gat him up upon his feet,<br> And all about the walls he beat<br> To find some token of the door,<br> But never could he find it more,<br> For by some dreadful sorcery<br> All was sealed close as it might be,<br> And midst the marvels of that hall<br> This scholar found the end of all.</p>  
 <p>   But in the town on that same night,<br> An hour before the dawn of light,<br> Such storm upon the place there fell,<br> That not the oldest man could tell<br> Of such another: and thereby<br> The image was burnt utterly,<br> Being stricken from the clouds above;<br> And folk deemed that same bolt did move<br> The pavement where that wretched one<br> Unto his foredoomed fate had gone,<br> Because the plate was set again<br> Into its place, and the great rain<br> Washed the earth down, and sorcery<br> Had hid the place where it did lie.<br>    So soon the stones were set all straight,<br> But yet the folk, afraid of fate,<br> Where once the man of cornel wood<br> Through many a year of bad and good<br> Had kept his place, set up alone<br> Great Jove himself, cut in white stone, <a name="page_452"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 452</font></a><br> But thickly overlaid with gold.<br> "Which," saith my tale, "you may behold<br> Unto this day, although indeed<br> Some Lord or other, being in need,<br> Took every ounce of gold away."<br>    But now, this tale in some past day<br> Being writ, I warrant all is gone,<br> Both gold and weather-beaten stone.</p>  
 <p>   Be merry, masters, while ye may,<br> For men much quicker pass away.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p><a name="page_453"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 453</font></a></p>  
 <p>THEY praised the tale, and for awhile they talked<br> Of other tales of treasure-seekers balked,<br> And shame and loss for men insatiate stored,<br> Nitocris tomb, the Niflungs fatal hoard,<br> The serpent-guarded treasures of the dead;<br> Then of how men would be remembered<br> When they are gone; and more than one could tell<br> Of what unhappy things therefrom befel;<br> Or how by folly men have gained a name;<br> A name indeed, not hallowed by the fame<br> Of any deeds remembered: and some thought,<br> 'Strange hopes and fears for what shall be but nought<br> To dead men! better it would be to give<br> What things they may, while on the earth they live<br> Unto the earth, and from the bounteous earth<br> To take their pay of sorrow or of mirth,<br> Hatred or love, and get them on their way;<br> And let the teeming earth fresh troubles make<br> For other men, and ever for their sake<br> Use what they left, when they are gone from it.'</p>  
 <p>   But while amid such musings they did sit,<br> Dark night being come, men lighted up the hall,<br> And the chief man for minstrelsy did call,<br> And other talk their dull thoughts chased away,<br> Nor did they part till night was mixed with day.</p>
