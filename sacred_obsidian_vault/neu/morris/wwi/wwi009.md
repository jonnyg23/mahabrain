 <p align="center">CHAPTER VIII. OF BIRDALONE AND THE WITCH-WIFE</p>  
 <p>It went with Birdalone as Habundia had foretold, for she came home to the house glad of semblance, flushed and light-foot, so that she was lovely and graceful beyond her wont.  The dame looked on her doubtfully and grimly a while, and then she said:  What ails thee, my servant, that thou lookest so masterful?  Nought ails me, lady, said Birdalone, save that I am gay because of the summer season, and chiefly because of thy kindness and thy gift, and that I have well- nigh done my work thereon, and that soon now I shall feel these dainty things beating about my ankles.  And she held up and spread abroad the skirt with her two hands, and it was indeed goodly to look on.</p>  
 <p>The witch-wife snorted scornfully and scowled on her, and said: Thine ankles forsooth!  Bag-o'-bones! thou wisp! forsooth, thou art in love with thy looks, though thou knowest not what like a fair woman is.  Forsooth, I begin to think that thou wilt never grow into a woman at all, but will abide a skinny elf thy life long.  Belike I did myself wrong to suffer thee to waste these three or four months of thy thrall's work, since for nought but thrall's work shalt thou ever be meet.</p>  
 <p>Birdalone hung her head adown, and blushed, but smiled a little, and swayed her body gently, as a willow-bough is swayed when a light air arises in the morning.  But the witch stood so scowling on her, and with so sour a look, that Birdalone, glancing at her, found her heart sink so within her, that she scarce kept countenance; yet she lost it not.</p>  
 <p>Then said the witch sharply:  Wert thou in the wood to-day?  Yea, lady, said the maiden.  Then said the dame fiercely:  And what sawest thou?  Quoth Birdalone, looking up with an innocent face somewhat scared:  Lady, I saw a bear, one of the big ones, crossing a glade. And thou without bow and arrow or wood-knife, I warrant me, said the witch.  Thou shalt be whipped, to keep thee in mind that thy life is mine and not thine.  Nay, nay, I pray thee be not wroth! said the maid; he was a long way down the glade, and would not have followed me if he had seen me:  there was no peril therein.  Said the witch- wife:  Didst thou see aught else?  Yea, said Birdalone, and was weeping somewhat now; which forsooth was not hard for her to do, over-wrought as she was betwixt hope and fear:  yea, I saw my white doe and her fawn, and they passed close by me; and two herons flew over my head toward the water; and . . .  But the witch turned sharply and said:  Thrall! hast thou seen a woman to-day in the wood? A woman? said Birdalone, and what woman, my lady, said Birdalone. Hath any woman come to the house, and passed forth into the wood?</p>  
 <p>The dame looked on her carefully, and remembered how she had faltered and changed countenance that other day, when she had charged her with being minded to flee; and now she saw her with wondering face, and in no wise confused or afraid of guilt, as it seemed; so she believed her tale, and being the more at ease thereby, her wrath ran off her, and she spake altogether pleasantly to Birdalone, and said:  Now I have had my gird at thee, my servant, I must tell thee that in sooth it is not all for nothing that thou hast had these months of rest; for verily thou hast grown more of a woman thereby, and hast sleekened and rounded much.  Albeit, the haysel will wait no longer for us, and the day after to-morrow we must fall to on it.  But when that is done, thou shalt be free to do thy green gown, or what thou wilt, till wheat harvest is toward; and thereafter we shall see to it.  Or what sayest thou?</p>  
 <p>Birdalone wondered somewhat at this so gracious word, but not much; for in her heart now was some guile born to meet the witch's guile; so she knelt down and took the dame's hands and kissed them, and said:  I say nought, lady, save that I thank thee over and over again that thou art become so good to me; and that I will full merrily work for thee in the hay-field, or at whatsoever else thou wilt.</p>  
 <p>And indeed she was so light-hearted that she had so escaped from the hand of the witch for that time, and above all, that she had gotten a friend so kind and dear as the wood-woman, that her heart went out even toward her mistress, so that she went nigh to loving her.</p>
