 <p align="center">CHAPTER L. FOLK-MIGHT SEETH THE BRIDE AND SPEAKETH WITH HER</p>  
 <p>Now tells the tale of Folk-might, that he went his ways from the Hall to the house where the Bride lay; and the swain who had brought the message went along with him, and he was proud of walking beside so mighty a warrior, and he talked to Folk-might as they went; and the sound of his voice was irksome to the chieftain, but he made as though he hearkened.  Yet when they came to the door of the house, which was just out of the Place on the Southern road (for thereby had the Bride fallen to earth), he could withhold his grief no longer, but turned on the threshold and laid his head on the door-jamb, and sobbed and wept till the tears fell down like rain.  And the boy stood by wondering, and wishing that Folk-might would forbear weeping, but durst not speak to him.</p>  
 <p>In a while Folk-might left weeping and went in, and found a fair hall sore befouled by the felons, and in the corner on a bed covered with furs the wounded woman; and at first sight he deemed her not so pale as he looked to see her, as she lay with her long dark-red hair strewed over the pillow, her head moving about wearily.  A linen cloth was thrown over her body, but her arms lay out of it before her.  Beside her sat the Alderman, his face sober enough, but not as one in heavy sorrow; and anigh him was another chair as if someone had but just got up from it.  There was no one else in the hall save two women of the Woodlanders, one of whom was cooking some potion on the hearth, and another was sweeping the floor anigh of bran or some such stuff, which had been thrown down to sop up the blood.</p>  
 <p>So Folk-might went up to the Bride, sorely dreading the image of death which she had grown to be, and sorely loving the woman she was and would be.</p>  
 <p>He knelt down by the bedside, heeding Iron-face little, though he nodded friendly to him, and he held his face close to hers; but she had her eyes shut and did not open them till he had been there a little while; and then they opened and fixed themselves on his without surprise or change.  Then she lifted her right hand (for it was in her left shoulder and side that she had been hurt) and slowly laid it on his head, and drew his face to hers and kissed it fondly, as she both smiled and let the tears run over from her eyes.  Then she spake in a weak voice:</p>  
 <p>'Thou seest, chieftain and dear friend, that I may not stand by thy victorious side to-day.  And now, though I were fain if thou wouldst never leave me, yet needs must thou go about thy work, since thou art become the Alderman of the Folk of Silver-dale.  Yea, and even if thou wert not to go from me, yet in a manner should I go from thee. For I am grievously hurt, and I know by myself, and also the leeches have told me, that the fever is a-coming on me; so that presently I shall not know thee, but may deem thee to be a woman, or a hound, or the very Wolf that is the image of the Father of thy kindred; or even, it may be, someone else--that I have played with time agone.'</p>  
 <p>Her voice faltered and faded out here, and she was silent a while; then she said:</p>  
 <p>'So depart, kind friend and dear love, bearing this word with thee, that should I die, I call on Iron-face my kinsman to bear witness that I bid thee carry me to bale in Silver-dale, and lay mine ashes with the ashes of thy Fathers, with whom thine own shall mingle at the last, since I have been of the warriors who have helped to bring thee aback to the land of thy folk.'</p>  
 <p>Then she smiled and shut her eyes and said:  'And if I live, as indeed I hope, and how glad and glad I shall be to live, then shalt thou bring me to thy house and thy bed, that I may not depart from thee while both our lives last.'</p>  
 <p>And she opened her eyes and looked at him; and he might not speak for a while, so ravished as he was betwixt joy and sorrow.  But the Alderman arose and took a gold ring from off his arm, and spake:</p>  
 <p>'This is the gold ring of the God of the Face, and I bear it on mine arm betwixt the Folk and the God in all man-motes, and I bore it through the battle to-day; and it is as holy a ring as may be; and since ye are plighting troth, and I am the witness thereof, it were good that ye held this ring together and called the God to witness, who is akin to the God of the Earth, as we all be.  Take the ring, Folk-might, for I trust thee; and of all women now alive would I have this woman happy.'</p>  
 <p>So Folk-might took the ring and thrust his hand through it, and took her hand, and said:</p>  
 <p>'Ye Fathers, thou God of the Face, thou Earth-god, thou Warrior, bear witness that my life and my body are plighted to this woman, the Bride of the House of the Steer!'</p>  
 <p>His face was flushed and bright as he spoke, but as his words ceased he noted how feebly her hand lay in his, and his face fell, and he gazed on her timidly.  But she lay quiet, and said softly and slowly:</p>  
 <p>'O Fathers of my kindred!  O Warrior and God of the Earth! bear witness that I plight my troth to this man, to lie in his grave if I die, and in his bed if I live.'</p>  
 <p>And she smiled on him again, and then closed her eyes; but opened them presently once more, and said:</p>  
 <p>'Dear friend, how fared it with Gold-mane to-day?'</p>  
 <p>Said Folk-might:  'So well he did, that none might have done better. He fared in the fight as if he had been our Father the Warrior:  he is a great chieftain.'</p>  
 <p>She said:  'Wilt thou give him this message from me, that in no wise he forget the oath which he swore upon the finger-ring as it lay on the sundial of the Garden of the Face?  And say, moreover, that I am sorry that we shall part, and have between us such breadth of wild-wood and mountain-neck.'</p>  
 <p>'Yea, surely will I give thy message,' said Folk-might; and in his heart he rejoiced, because he heard her speak as if she were sure of life.  Then she said faintly:</p>  
 <p>'It is now thy work to depart from me, and to do as it behoveth a chieftain of the people and the Alderman of Silver-dale.  Depart, lest the leeches chide me:  farewell, my dear!'</p>  
 <p>So he laid his face to hers and kissed her, and rose up and embraced Iron-face, and went his ways without looking back.</p>  
 <p>But just over the threshold he met old Hall-ward of the House of the Steer, who was at point to enter, and he greeted him kindly.  The old man looked on him steadily, and said:  'To-morrow or the day after I will utter a word to thee, O Chief of the Wolf.'</p>  
 <p>'In a good hour,' said Folk-might, 'for all thy words are true.' Therewith he gat him away from the house, and came to Face-of-god, where he sat before the altar of the Crooked Sword; and now were the chiefs come back from their meat, and were sitting with him; there also were Wood-father and Wood-wont; but Bow-may was with the Sun-beam, who was resting softly in the fair meadow after all the turmoil.</p>  
 <p>So men made place for Folk-might beside the War-leader, who looked upon his face, and saw that it was sober and unsmiling, but not heavy or moody with grief.  So he deemed that all was as well as it might be with the Bride, and with a good heart fell to taking counsel with the others; and kindly and friendly were the redes which they held there, with no gainsaying of man by man, for the whole folk was glad at heart.</p>  
 <p>So there they ordered all matters duly for that present time, and by then they had made an end, it was past sunset, and men were lodged in the chief houses about the Market-stead.</p>  
 <p>Albeit, though they ate their meat with all joy of heart, and were merry in converse one with the other, the men of the Wolf would by no means feast in their Hall again till it had been cleansed and hallowed anew.</p>
