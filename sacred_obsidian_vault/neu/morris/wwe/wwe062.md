 <p align="center">CHAPTER 37</p>  
 <p align="center">How Ralph Justed With the Aliens</p>  
 <p>Meanwhile Captain Otter had brought Ralph into the staked-out lists, which, being hastily pitched, were but slenderly done, and now the Upmeads stripling stood there beside a good horse which they had brought to him, and Otter had been speaking to him friendly. But Ralph saw the Lord come forth from the pavilion and take his seat on an ivory chair set on a turf ridge close to the stakes of the lists:  for that place was used of custom for such games as they exercised in the lands of Utterbol. Then presently the Lady's women came out of their tents, and, being marshalled by Agatha, went into the Queen's pavilion, whence they came forth again presently like a bed of garden flowers moving, having in the midst of them a woman so fair, and clad so gloriously, that Ralph must needs look on her, though he were some way off, and take note of her beauty. She went and sat her down beside the Lord, and Ralph doubted not that it was the Queen, whom he had but glanced at when they first made stay before the pavilion. Sooth to say, Joyce being well nigh as tall as the Queen, and as white of skin, was otherwise a far fairer woman.</p>  
 <p>Now spake Otter to Ralph:  "I must leave thee here, lad, and go to the other side, as I am to run against thee."  Said Ralph: "Art thou to run first?"  "Nay, but rather last," said Otter; "they will try thee first with one of the sergeants, and if he overcome thee, then all is done, and thou art in an evil plight. Otherwise will they find another and another, and at last it will be my turn.  So keep thee well, lad."</p>  
 <p>Therewith he rode away, and there came to Ralph one of the sergeants, who brought him a spear, and bade him to horse. So Ralph mounted and took the spear in hand; and the sergeant said: "Thou art to run at whatsoever meeteth thee when thou hast heard the third blast of the horn.  Art thou ready?"  "Yea, yea," said Ralph; "but I see that the spear-head is not rebated, so that we are to play at sharps."</p>  
 <p>"Art thou afraid, youngling?" said the sergeant, who was old and crabbed, "if that be so, go and tell the Lord: but thou wilt find that he will not have his sport wholly spoiled, but will somehow make a bolt or a shaft out of thee."</p>  
 <p>Said Ralph:  "I did but jest; I deem myself not so near my death to-day as I have been twice this summer or oftener." Said the sergeant, "It is ill jesting in matters wherein my Lord hath to do.  Now thou hast heard my word: do after it."</p>  
 <p>Therewith he departed, and Ralph laughed and shook the spear aloft, and deemed it not over strong; but he said to himself that the spears of the others would be much the same.</p>  
 <p>Now the horn blew up thrice, and at the latest blast Ralph pricked forth, as one well used to the tilt, but held his horse well in hand; and he saw a man come driving against him with his spear in the rest, and deemed him right big; but this withal he saw, that the man was ill arrayed, and was pulling on his horse as one not willing to trust him to the rush; and indeed he came on so ill that it was clear that he would never strike Ralph's shield fairly. So he swerved as they met, so that his spear-point was never near to Ralph, who turned his horse toward him a little, and caught his foeman by the gear about his neck, and spurred on, so that he dragged him clean out of his saddle, and let him drop, and rode back quietly to his place, and got off his horse to see to his girths; and he heard great laughter rising up from the ring of men, and from the women also.  But the Lord of Utterbol cried out: "Bring forth some one who doth not eat my meat for nothing: and set that wretch and dastard aside till the tilting be over, and then he shall pay a little for his wasted meat and drink."</p>  
 <p>Ralph got into his saddle again, and saw a very big man come forth at the other end of the lists, and wondered if he should be overthrown of him; but noted that his horse seemed not over good.  Then the horn blew up and he spurred on, and his foeman met him fairly in the midmost of the lists: yet he laid his spear but ill, and as one who would thrust and foin with it rather than letting it drive all it might, so that Ralph turned the point with his shield that it glanced off, but he himself smote the other full on the shoulder, and the shaft brake, but the point had pierced the man's armour, and the truncheon stuck in the wound: yet since the spear was broken he kept his saddle. The Lord cried out, "Well, Black Anselm, this is better done; yet art thou a big man and a well-skilled to be beaten by a stripling."</p>  
 <p>So the man was helped away and Ralph went back to his place again.</p>  
 <p>Then another man was gotten to run against Ralph, and it went the same-like way:  for Ralph smote him amidst of the shield, and the spear held, so that he fell floundering off his horse.</p>  
 <p>Six of the stoutest men of Utterbol did Ralph overthrow or hurt in this wise; and then he ran three courses with Otter, and in the first two each brake his spear fairly on the other; but in the third Otter smote not Ralph squarely, but Ralph smote full amidst of his shield, and so dight him that he well-nigh fell, and could not master his horse, but yet just barely kept his saddle.</p>  
 <p>Then the Lord cried out:  "Now make we an end of it! We have no might against this youngling, man to man: or else would Otter have done it.  This comes of learning a craft diligently."</p>  
 <p>So Ralph got off his horse, and did off his helm and awaited tidings; and anon comes to him the surly sergeant, and brought him a cup of wine, and said:  "Youngling, thou art to drink this, and then go to my Lord; and I deem that thou art in favour with him.  So if thou art not too great a man, thou mightest put in a word for poor Redhead, that first man that did so ill.  For my Lord would have him set up, and head down and buttocks aloft, as a target for our bowmen. And it will be his luck if he be sped with the third shot, and last not out to the twentieth."</p>  
 <p>"Yea, certes," said Ralph, "I will do no less, even if it anger the Lord."  "O thou wilt not anger him," said the man, "for I tell thee, thou art in favour.  Yea, and for me also thou mightest say a word also, when thou becomest right great; for have I not brought thee a good bowl of wine?" "Doubt it not, man," said Ralph, "if I once get safe to Utterbol: weary on it and all its ways!"  Said the sergeant: "That is an evil wish for one who shall do well at Utterbol. But come, tarry not."</p>  
 <p>So he brought Ralph to the Lord, who still sat in his chair beside that fair woman, and Ralph did obeysance to him; yet he had a sidelong glance also for that fair seeming-queen, and deemed her both proud-looking, and so white-skinned, that she was a wonder, like the queen of the fays: and it was just this that he had noted of the Queen as he stood before her earlier in the day when they first came into the vale; therefore he had no doubt of this damsel's queenship.</p>  
 <p>Now the Lord spake to him and said:  "Well, youngling, thou hast done well, and better than thy behest:  and since ye have been playing at sharps, I deem thou would'st not do ill in battle, if it came to that. So now I am like to make something other of thee than I was minded to at first:  for I deem that thou art good enough to be a man. And if thou wilt now ask a boon of me, if it be not over great, I will grant it thee."</p>  
 <p>Ralph put one knee to the ground, and said:  "Great Lord, I thank thee:  but whereas I am in an alien land and seeking great things, I know of no gift which I may take for myself save leave to depart, which I deem thou wilt not grant me. Yet one thing thou mayst do for my asking if thou wilt. If thou be still angry with the carle whom I first unhorsed, I pray thee pardon him his ill-luck."</p>  
 <p>"Ill-luck!" said the Lord, "Why, I saw him that he was downright afraid of thee.  And if my men are to grow blenchers and soft-hearts what is to do then?  But tell me, Otter, what is the name of this carle?" Said Otter, "Redhead he hight, Lord."  Said the Lord:  "And what like a man is he in a fray?"  "Naught so ill, Lord," said Otter. "This time, like the rest of us, he knew not this gear. It were scarce good to miss him at the next pinch. It were enough if he had the thongs over his back a few dozen times; it will not be the first day of such cheer to him."</p>  
 <p>"Ha!" said the Lord, "and what for, Otter, what for?" "Because he was somewhat rough-handed, Lord," said Otter. "Then shall we need him and use him some day.  Let him go scot free and do better another bout.  There is thy boon granted for thee, knight; and another day thou mayst ask something more. And now shall David have a care of thee.  And when we come to Utterbol we shall see what is to be done with thee."</p>  
 <p>Then Ralph rose up and thanked him, and David came forward, and led him to his tent.  And he was wheedling in his ways to him, as if Ralph were now become one who might do him great good if so his will were.</p>  
 <p>But the Lord went back again into the Tower.</p>  
 <p>As to the Lady, she abode in her pavilion amidst many fears and desires, till Agatha entered and said:  "My Lady, so far all has gone happily." Said the Lady:  "I deemed from the noise and the cry that he was doing well. But tell me, how did he?"  "My Lady," quoth Agatha, "he knocked our folk about well-favouredly, and seemed to think little of it."</p>  
 <p>"And Joyce," said the Lady, "how did she?"  "She looked a queen, every inch of her, and she is tall," said Agatha:  "soothly some folk stared on her, but not many knew of her, since she is but new into our house.  Though it is a matter of course that all save our new-come knight knew that it was not thou that sat there. And my Lord was well-pleased, and now he hath taken her by the hand and led her into the Tower."</p>  
 <p>The Lady reddened and scowled, and said:  "And he... did he come anigh her?" "O yea," said Agatha, "whereas he stood before my Lord a good while, and then kneeled to him to pray pardon for one of our men who had done ill in the tilting:  yea, he was nigh enough to her to touch her had he dared, and to smell the fragrance of her raiment. And he seemed to think it good to look out of the corners of his eyes at her; though I do not say that she smiled on him." The Lady sprang up, her cheeks burning, and walked about angrily a while, striving for words, till at last she said:  "When we come home to Utterbol, my lord will see his new thrall again, and will care for Joyce no whit: then will I have my will of her; and she shall learn, she, whether I am verily the least of women at Utterbol!  Ha! what sayest thou? Now why wilt thou stand and smile on me?—Yea, I know what is in thy thought; and in very sooth it is good that the dear youngling hath not seen this new thrall, this Ursula.  Forsooth, I tell thee that if I durst have her in my hands I would have a true tale out of her as to why she weareth ever that pair of beads about her neck."</p>  
 <p>"Now, our Lady," said Agatha, "thou art marring the fairness of thy face again.  I bid thee be at peace, for all shall be well, and other than thou deemest.  Tell me, then, didst thou get our Lord to swear immunity for me?"  Said the Lady: "Yea, he swore on the edge of the sword that thou mightest say what thou wouldst, and neither he nor any other should lay hand on thee."</p>  
 <p>"Good," said Agatha; "then will I go to him to-morrow morning, when Joyce has gone from him.  But now hold up thine heart, and keep close for these two days that we shall yet abide in Tower Dale: and trust me this very evening I shall begin to set tidings going that shall work and grow, and shall one day rejoice thine heart."</p>  
 <p>So fell the talk betwixt them.</p>
