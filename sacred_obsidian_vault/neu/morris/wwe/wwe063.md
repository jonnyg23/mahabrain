 <p align="center">CHAPTER 38</p>  
 <p align="center">A Friend Gives Ralph Warning</p>  
 <p> On the morrow Ralph wandered about the Dale where he would, and none meddled with him.  And as he walked east along the stream where the valley began to narrow, he saw a man sitting on the bank fishing with an angle, and when he drew near, the man turned about, and saw him. Then he lays down his angling rod and rises to his feet, and stands facing Ralph, looking sheepish, with his hands hanging down by his sides; and Ralph, who was thinking of other folk, wondered what he would. So he said:  "Hail, good fellow!  What wouldst thou?"  Said the man: "I would thank thee."  "What for?" said Ralph, but as he looked on him he saw that it was Redhead, whose pardon he had won of the Lord yesterday; so he held out his hand, and took Redhead's, and smiled friendly on him. Redhead looked him full in the face, and though he was both big and very rough-looking, he had not altogether the look of a rascal.</p>  
 <p>He said:  "Fair lord, I would that I might do something for thine avail, and perchance I may:  but it is hard to do good deeds in Hell, especially for one of its devils."</p>  
 <p>"Yea, is it so bad as that?" said Ralph.  "For thee not yet," said Redhead, "but it may come to it.  Hearken, lord, there is none anigh us that I can see, so I will say a word to thee at once.  Later on it may be over late: Go thou not to Utterbol whatever may betide."</p>  
 <p>"Yea," said Ralph, "but how if I be taken thither?"  Quoth Redhead: "I can see this, that thou art so favoured that thou mayst go whither thou wilt about the camp with none to hinder thee. Therefore it will be easy for thee to depart by night and cloud, or in the grey of morning, when thou comest to a good pass, whereof I will tell thee.  And still I say, go thou not to Utterbol: for thou art over good to be made a devil of, like to us, and therefore thou shalt be tormented till thy life is spoilt, and by that road shalt thou be sent to heaven."</p>  
 <p>"But thou saidst even now," said Ralph, "that I was high in the Lord's grace."  "Yea," said Redhead, "that may last till thou hast command to do some dastard's deed and nay-sayest it, as thou wilt: and then farewell to thee; for I know what my Lord meaneth for thee." "Yea," said Ralph, "and what is that?"  Said Redhead; "He hath bought thee to give to his wife for a toy and a minion, and if she like thee, it will be well for a while:  but on the first occasion that serveth him, and she wearieth of thee (for she is a woman like a weather-cock), he will lay hand on thee and take the manhood from thee, and let thee drift about Utterbol a mock for all men. For already at heart he hateth thee."</p>  
 <p>Ralph stood pondering this word, for somehow it chimed in with the thought already in his heart.  Yet how should he not go to Utterbol with the Damsel abiding deliverance of him there: and yet again, if they met there and were espied on, would not that ruin everything for her as well as for him?</p>  
 <p>At last he said:  "Good fellow, this may be true, but how shall I know it for true before I run the risk of fleeing away, instead of going on to Utterbol, whereas folk deem honour awaiteth me."</p>  
 <p>Said Redhead:  "There is no honour at Utterbol save for such as are unworthy of honour.  But thy risk is as I say, and I shall tell thee whence I had my tale, since I love thee for thy kindness to me, and thy manliness.  It was told me yester-eve by a woman who is in the very privity of the Lady of Utterbol, and is well with the Lord also: and it jumpeth with mine own thought on the matter; so I bid thee beware: for what is in me to grieve would be sore grieved wert thou cast away."  "Well," said Ralph, "let us sit down here on the bank and then tell me more; but go on with thine angling the while, lest any should see us."</p>  
 <p>So they sat down, and Redhead did as Ralph bade; and he said: "Lord, I have bidden thee to flee; but this is an ill land to flee from, and indeed there is but one pass whereby ye may well get away from this company betwixt this and Utterbol; and we shall encamp hard by it on the second day of our faring hence. Yet I must tell thee that it is no road for a dastard; for it leadeth through the forest up into the mountains:  yet such as it is, for a man bold and strong like thee, I bid thee take it: and I can see to it that leaving this company shall be easy to thee: only thou must make up thy mind speedily, since the time draws so nigh, and when thou art come to Utterbol with all this rout, and the house full, and some one or other dogging each footstep of thine, fleeing will be another matter.  Now thus it is: on that same second night, not only is the wood at hand to cover thee, but I shall be chief warder of the side of the camp where thou lodgest, so that I can put thee on the road: and if I were better worth, I would say, take me with thee, but as it is, I will not burden thee with that prayer."</p>  
 <p>"Yea," said Ralph, "I have had one guide in this country-side and he bewrayed me.  This is a matter of life and death, so I will speak out and say how am I to know but that thou also art going about to bewray me?"</p>  
 <p>Redhead lept up to his feet, and roared out:  "What shall I say? what shall I say?  By the soul of my father I am not bewraying thee. May all the curses of Utterbol be sevenfold heavier on me if I am thy traitor and dastard."</p>  
 <p>"Softly lad, softly," said Ralph, "lest some one should hear thee. Content thee, I must needs believe thee if thou makest so much noise about it."</p>  
 <p>Then Redhead sat him down again, and for all that he was so rough and sturdy a carle he fell a-weeping.</p>  
 <p>"Nay, nay," said Ralph, "this is worse in all wise than the other noise.  I believe thee as well as a man can who is dealing with one who is not his close friend, and who therefore spareth truth to his friend because of many years use and wont. Come to thyself again and let us look at this matter square in the face, and speedily too, lest some unfriend or busybody come on us. There now!  Now, in the first place dost thou know why I am come into this perilous and tyrannous land?"</p>  
 <p>Said Redhead:  "I have heard it said that thou art on the quest of the Well at the World's End."</p>  
 <p>"And that is but the sooth," said Ralph.  "Well then," quoth Redhead, "there is the greater cause for thy fleeing at the time and in the manner I have bidden thee.  For there is a certain sage who dwelleth in the wildwood betwixt that place and the Great Mountains, and he hath so much lore concerning the Mountains, yea, and the Well itself, that if he will tell thee what he can tell, thou art in a fair way to end thy quest happily. What sayest thou then?"</p>  
 <p>Said Ralph, "I say that the Sage is good if I may find him. But there is another cause why I have come hither from Goldburg." "What is that?" said Redhead.  "This," said Ralph, "to come to Utterbol." "Heaven help us!" quoth Redhead, "and wherefore?"</p>  
 <p>Ralph said:  "Belike it is neither prudent nor wise to tell thee, but I do verily trust thee; so hearken!  I go to Utterbol to deliver a friend from Utterbol; and this friend is a woman—hold a minute— and this woman, as I believe, hath been of late brought to Utterbol, having been taken out of the hands of one of the men of the mountains that lie beyond Cheaping Knowe."</p>  
 <p>Redhead stared astonished, and kept silence awhile; then he said:  "Now all the more I say, flee! flee! flee! Doubtless the woman is there, whom thou seekest; for it would take none less fair and noble than that new-come thrall to draw to her one so fair and noble as thou art.  But what availeth it? If thou go to Utterbol thou wilt destroy both her and thee. For know, that we can all see that the Lord hath set his love on this damsel; and what better can betide, if thou come to Utterbol, but that the Lord shall at once see that there is love betwixt you two, and then there will be an end of the story."</p>  
 <p>"How so?" quoth Ralph.  Said Redhead:  "At Utterbol all do the will of the Lord of Utterbol, and he is so lustful and cruel, and so false withal, that his will shall be to torment the damsel to death, and to geld and maim thee; so that none hereafter shall know how goodly and gallant thou hast been."</p>  
 <p>"Redhead," quoth Ralph much moved, "though thou art in no knightly service, thou mayst understand that it is good for a friend to die with a friend."</p>  
 <p>"Yea, forsooth," said Redhead, "If he may do no more to help than that! Wouldst thou not help the damsel?  Now when thou comest back from the quest of the Well at the World's End, thou wilt be too mighty and glorious for the Lord of Utterbol to thrust thee aside like to an over eager dog; and thou mayst help her then.  But now I say to thee, and swear to thee, that three days after thou hast met thy beloved in Utterbol she will be dead. I would that thou couldst ask someone else nearer to the Lord than I have been.  The tale would be the same as mine."</p>  
 <p>Now soothly to say it, this was even what Ralph had feared would be, and he could scarce doubt Redhead's word.  So he sat there pondering the matter a good while, and at last he said: "My friend, I will trust thee with another thing; I have a mind to flee to the wildwood, and yet come to Utterbol for the damsel's deliverance." "Yea," said Redhead, "and how wilt thou work in the matter?" Said Ralph; "How would it be if I came hither in other guise than mine own, so that I should not be known either by the damsel or her tyrants?"</p>  
 <p>Said Redhead:  "There were peril in that; yet hope also. Yea, and in one way thou mightest do it; to wit, if thou wert to find that Sage, and tell him thy tale:  if he be of good will to thee, he might then change not thy gear only, but thy skin also; for he hath exceeding great lore."</p>  
 <p>"Well," said Ralph, "Thou mayst look upon it as certain that on that aforesaid night, I will do my best to shake off this company of tyrant and thralls, unless I hear fresh tidings, so that I must needs change my purpose. But I will ask thee to give me some token that all holds together some little time beforehand."  Quoth Redhead:  "Even so shall it be; thou shalt see me at latest on the eve of the night of thy departure; but on the night before that if it be anywise possible."</p>  
 <p>"Now will I go away from thee," said Ralph, "and I thank thee heartily for thine help, and deem thee my friend.  And if thou think better of fleeing with me, thou wilt gladden me the more." Redhead shook his head but spake not, and Ralph went his ways down the dale.</p>
