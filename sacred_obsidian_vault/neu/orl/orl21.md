 Zerbino for Gabrina, who a heart<br>
 Of asp appears to bear, contends. O’erthrown,<br>
 The Fleming falls upon the other part,<br>
 Through cause of that despised and odious crone,<br>
 He wounded sore, and writhing with the smart,<br>
 The beldam’s treason to the prince makes known,<br>
 Whose scorn and hatred hence derive new force.<br>
 Towards loud cries Zerbino spurs his horse.</i></small></td></tr>

 Who better knew what deadly poisons slay<br>
 Than he the force of healing syrup scanned;<br>
 And promised him his service to repay<br>
 With a reward exceeding his demand,<br>
 When he should, with some drink of deadly might,<br>
 Of her detested husband rid her sight.</td></tr>

 “In presence of myself and more beside,<br>
 The wicked elder, with his deadly dole,<br>
 Approaching my unhappy brother, cried,<br>
 ‘It was a sovereign drink to make him whole.’<br>
 But here a new device Gabrina tried,<br>
 And, ere the sickly man could taste the bowl,<br>
 To rid her of accomplice in the deed,<br>
 Or to defraud him of his promised meed;</td></tr>

 “Seized on his hand, the instant he presented<br>
 The poison to my brother. ‘Ill my fear,<br>
 (Exclaimed the dame) by you would be resented,<br>
 Excited for a spouse I hold so dear.<br>
 I, that the beverage has not been fermented<br>
 With evil drug and poisonous, will be clear;<br>
 Nor deem it meet that you to him convey<br>
 The proffered bowl, unless you take the say.’</td></tr>

 “In what condition think you, sir, remained<br>
 The wretched elder by his fears opprest?<br>
 Thus by the woman’s suddenness constrained,<br>
 He had no time for thinking what were best.<br>
 He, lest more doubt of him be entertained,<br>
 Tastes of the chalice, at Gabrina’s hest;<br>
 And the sick man, emboldened so, drinks up<br>
 All the remainder of the poisoned cup.</td></tr>

 “As the trained hawk of crooked talon who<br>
 Clutches the partridge, when about to eat,<br>
 Is by the dog, she deems her comrade true,<br>
 O’ertaken and defrauded of the meat;<br>
 So on ill gain intent, the leech, in lieu<br>
 Of the expected aid, received defeat.<br>
 Hear, thus, what sovereign wickedness will dare,<br>
 And be like fate each greedy miscreant’s share!</td></tr>

 “This past and done, the leech would homeward speed,<br>
 That he, to counteract the pest he bore<br>
 Within his bowels, in this fearful need,<br>
 Might use some secret of his cunning lore;<br>
 But this the wicked dame would not concede,<br>
 Forbidding him to issue thence before<br>
 His patient’s stomach should the juice digest,<br>
 And its restoring power be manifest.</td></tr>

 “No prayer will move, nor offered price will buy<br>
 The woman’s leave to let him thence depart.<br>
 The desperate man who saw that death was nigh,<br>
 And sure to follow, quickly changed his part;<br>
 And told the story to the standers-by;<br>
 Nor could she cover it with all her art.<br>
 Thus what he wont to do by many a one,<br>
 That goodly doctor by himself has done;</td></tr>

 “And follows with his soul my brother true,<br>
 That hence, already freed, was gone before.<br>
 We, the assistants, that the matter knew<br>
 From the old man who lingered little more,<br>
 Took that abominable monster, who<br>
 More cruel was than beast in forest hoar,<br>
 And, prisoned in a darksome place, reserved<br>
 To perish in the fire, as she deserved.”</td></tr>

 So said Hermonides, and had pursued<br>
 His tale, and told how she from prison fled;<br>
 But suffered from his wound a pang so shrewd,<br>
 He fell reversed upon his grassy bed.<br>
 Meanwhile two squires, who served him in the wood,<br>
 A rustic bier of sturdy branches spread.<br>
 Their master upon this the servants lay,<br>
 Who could not thence be borne in other way.</td></tr>

 Zerbino, in excuse, assured the peer,<br>
 He grieved so good a knight to have offended;<br>
 But, as was still the use of cavalier,<br>
 Had guarded her who in his guidance wended;<br>
 Nor had he else preserved his honour clear:<br>
 For when the dame was to his care commended,<br>
 Her to defend his promise he had plight<br>
 From all men, to the utmost of his might.</td></tr>

 He, if he might, is any thing beside,<br>
 Would readily assist him in his need.<br>
 —His only wish, (the cavalier replied,)<br>
 Was, he might be from ill Gabrina freed,<br>
 Ere him some mighty mischief should betide,<br>
 Of future penitence the bitter seed.<br>
 Gabrina keeps on earth her downcast eye;<br>
 For ill the simple truth admits reply.</td></tr>

 Zerbino thence, upon the promised way,<br>
 With the old woman in his escort, went,<br>
 And inly cursed her all the livelong day,<br>
 That in her cause that baron he had shent.<br>
 And having heard the knight her guilt display,<br>
 Who was instructed in her evil bent,<br>
 He—if before he had her at despite—<br>
 So loathed her, she was poison to his sight.</td></tr>

 Well read in young Zerbino’s hate, the dame<br>
 Would not by him in malice be outdone,<br>
 Nor bated him an inch, but in that game<br>
 Of deadly hatred set him two for one.<br>
 Her face was with the venom in a flame<br>
 Wherewith her swelling bosom overrun.<br>
 ’Twas thus in such concord as I say,<br>
 These through the ancient wood pursued their way.</td></tr>

 When, lo! as it is now nigh eventide,<br>
 They a mixt sound of blows and outcries hear,<br>
 Which seem a sign of battle fiercely plied,<br>
 And (as the deafening noise demonstrates) near.<br>
 To mark what this might be, towards that side<br>
 Whence came the tumult, moved the Scottish peer;<br>
 Nor is in following him Gabrina slow:<br>
 What chanced in other canto you shall know.</td></tr>
