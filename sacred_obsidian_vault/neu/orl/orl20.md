 And in the youthful ornaments she wore,<br>
 Looked like an ape which men in mockery dress;<br>
 And now appears more foul, as angered sore,<br>
 While rage and wrath her kindled eyes express.<br>
 For none can do a woman worse despite<br>
 Than to proclaim her old and foul to sight.</td></tr>

 Of wrath the maid assumed upon her part,<br>
 And to the prince, “By Heaven, more passing fair<br>
 Is this my lady than thou courteous art,”<br>
 Exclaimed in answer; “though I am aware<br>
 What thou hast uttered comes not from thy heart.<br>
 Thou wilt not own her beauty; a device<br>
 Put on to masque thy sovereign cowardice.</td></tr>

 “And of what stamp would be that cavalier<br>
 Who found such fair and youthful dame alone,<br>
 Without protection, in the forest drear,<br>
 Nor sought to make the lovely weft his own?”<br>
 —“So well she sorts with thee,” replied the peer,<br>
 “ ’Twere ill that she were claimed by any one:<br>
 Nor I of her would thee in any wise<br>
 Deprive; God rest thee merry with thy prize!</td></tr>

 “But would thou prove what is my chivalry,<br>
 On other ground I to thy wish incline;<br>
 Yet deem me not of such perversity<br>
 As to tilt with thee for this prize of thine.<br>
 Or fair or foul, let her remain thy fee;<br>
 I would not, I, such amity disjoin.<br>
 Well are ye paired, and safely would I swear<br>
 That thou as valiant art as she is fair.”</td></tr>

 To him Marphisa, “Thou in thy despite<br>
 Shalt try to bear from me the dame away.<br>
 I will not suffer that so fair a sight<br>
 Thou shouldst behold, nor seek to gain the prey.”<br>
 To her the prince, “I know not wherefore wight<br>
 Should suffer pain and peril in affray,<br>
 Striving for victory, where, for his pains,<br>
 The victor losses, and the vanquished gains.”</td></tr>

 “If this condition please not, other course<br>

 In this our tourney, she remains with me:<br>

 Premised, if loser, thou shalt be her guide,<br>

 “And be it so,” Zerbino cried, and wheeled<br>
 Swiftly his foaming courser for the shock,<br>
 And rising in his stirrups scowered the field,<br>
 Firm in his seat, and smote, with levelled stock,<br>
 For surer aim, the damsel in mid-shield;<br>
 But she sate stedfast as a metal rock,<br>
 And at the warrior’s morion thrust so well,<br>
 She clean out-bore him senseless from the sell.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXVII.</td><td>
 Much grieved the prince, to whom in other fray<br>
 The like misfortune had not chanced before,<br>
 Who had unhorsed some thousands in his day:<br>
 Now shamed, he thought for ever. Troubled sore,<br>
 And mute long space upon the ground he lay,<br>
 And, when ’twas recollected, grieved the more,<br>
 That he had promised, and that he was bound,<br>
 To accompany the hag where’er she wound.</td></tr>

 Turning about to him the victoress cried,<br>
 Laughing, “This lady I to thee present,<br>
 And the more beauty is in her descried,<br>
 The more that she is thine I am content,<br>
 Now in my place her champion and her guide.<br>
 But do not thou thy plighted faith repent,<br>
 So that thou fail, as promised, to attend<br>
 The dame, wherever she may please to wend.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXIX.</td><td>
 Without awaiting answer, to career<br>
 She spurred her horse, and vanished in the wood.<br>
 Zerbino, deeming her a cavalier,<br>
 Cried to the crone, “By whom am I subdued?”<br>
 And, knowing ’twould be poison to his ear,<br>
 And that it would inflame his angered blood,<br>
 She in reply, “It was a damsel’s blow<br>
 Which from thy lofty saddle laid thee low.</td></tr>

 “She, for her matchless force, deservedly<br>
 Usurps from cavalier the sword and lance;<br>
 And even from the east is come to try<br>
 Her strength against the paladins of France.”<br>
 Not only was his cheek of crimson dye,<br>
 Such shame Zerbino felt as his mischance,<br>
 Little was wanting (so his blushes spread)<br>
 But all the arms he wore had glowed as red.</td></tr>

 He mounts, and blames himself in angry wise,<br>
 In that he had no better kept his seat.<br>
 Within herself the beldam laughs, and tries<br>
 The Scottish warrior more to sting and heat.<br>
 To him for promised convoy she applies;<br>
 And he, who knows that there is no retreat,<br>
 Stands like tired courser, who in pensive fit,<br>
 Hangs down his ears, controlled by spur and bit.</td></tr>

 And, sighing deeply, cries, in his despair,<br>
 “Fell Fortune, with what change dost thou repay<br>
 My loss! she who was fairest of the fair,<br>
 Who should be mine, by thee is snatched away!<br>
 And thinkest thou the evil to repair<br>
 With her whom thou hast given to me this day?<br>
 Rather than make like ill exchange, less cross<br>
 It were to undergo a total loss.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXIII.</td><td>
 “Her, who for virtue and for beauteous form<br>
 Was never equalled, nor will ever be,<br>
 Thou on the rocks hast wrecked, in wintry storm,<br>
 As food for fowls and fishes of the sea;<br>
 And her who should have fed the earth-bred worm<br>
 Preserved beyond her date, some ten or score<br>
 Of years, to harass and torment me more.”</td></tr>

 So spake Zerbino, and like grief displaid,<br>
 In his despairing words and woful mien,<br>
 For such an odious acquisition made,<br>
 As he had suffered when he lost his queen.<br>
 The aged woman now, from what he said,<br>
 Though she before Zerbino had not seen,<br>
 Perceived ’twas him of whom, in the thieves’ hold,<br>
 Isabel of Gallicia erst had told.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXV.</td><td>
 If you remember what was said before,<br>
 This was the hag who ’scaped out of the cave,<br>
 Where Isabella, who had wounded sore<br>
 Zerbino’s heart, was long detained a slave;<br>
 Who oft had told how she her native shore<br>
 Had left, and, launching upon ocean’s wave<br>
 Her frigate, had been wrecked by wind and swell<br>
 Upon the rocky shallows near Rochelle.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXVI.</td><td>
 And she to her Zerbino’s goodly cheer<br>
 And gentle features had pourtrayed so well,<br>
 That the hag hearing him, and now more near,<br>
 Letter her eyes upon his visage dwell,<br>
 Discerned it was the youth for whom, whilere,<br>
 Had grieved at heart the prisoned Isabel;<br>
 Whose loss she in the cavern more deplored,<br>
 Than being captive to the murderous horde.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXVII.</td><td>
 The beldam, hearing what in rage and grief<br>
 Zerbino vents, perceives the youth to be<br>
 Deceived, and cheated by the false belief<br>
 That Isabel had perished in the sea;<br>
 And though she might have given the prince relief,<br>
 Knowing the truth, in her perversity<br>
 What would have made him joyful she concealed,<br>
 And only what would cause him grief revealed.</td></tr>

 “Hear, you that are so proud,” (the hag pursues)<br>
 “And flout me with such insolence and scorn,<br>
 You would entreat me fair to have the news<br>
 I know of her whose timeless death you mourn;<br>
 But to be strangled would I rather choose,<br>
 And be into a thousand pieces torn.<br>
 Whereas if you had made me kinder cheer,<br>
 Haply from me the secret might you hear.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXXIX.</td><td>
 As the dog’s rage is quickly overblown,<br>
 Who flies the approaching robber to arrest,<br>
 If the thief proffer piece of bread or bone,<br>
 Of offer other lure which likes him best;<br>
 As readily Zerbino to the crone<br>
 Humbled himself, and burned to know the rest;<br>
 Who, in the hints of the old woman, read<br>
 That she had news of her he mourned as dead.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXL.</td><td>
 And with more winning mien to her applied,<br>
 And her did supplicate, entreat, conjure,<br>
 By men and gods, the truth no more to hide,<br>
 Did she benign or evil lot endure.<br>
 The hard and pertinacious crone replied,<br>
 “Nought shalt thou hear, thy comfort to assure.<br>
 Isabel has not yielded up her breath,<br>
 But lives a life she would exchange for death.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXLI.</td><td>
 “She, since thou heardest of her destiny,<br>
 Within few days, has fallen into the power<br>
 Of more than twenty. If restored to thee,<br>
 Think now, if thou hast hope to crop her flower.”<br>
 —“Curst hag, how well thou shapest thy history,<br>
 Yet knowest it is false! Her virgin dower<br>
 Secure from brutal wrong, would none invade,<br>
 Though in the power of twenty were the maid.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXLII.</td><td>
 Questioning of the maid, he when and where<br>
 She saw her, vainly asked the beldam hoar,<br>
 Who, ever restive to Zerbino’s prayer,<br>
 To what she had rehearsed would add no more.<br>
 The prince in the beginning spoke her fair,<br>
 And next to cut her throat in fury swore.<br>
 But prayers and menaces alike were weak;<br>
 Nor could he make the hideous beldam speak.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXLIII.</td><td>
 At length Zerbino to his tongue gave rest,<br>
 Since speaking to the woman booted nought;<br>
 Scarcely his heart found room within his breast,<br>
 Such dread suspicion had her story wrought.<br>
 He to find Isabella was so pressed,<br>
 Her in the midst of fire he would have sought;<br>
 But could not hurry more than was allowed<br>
 By her his convoy, since he so had vowed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXLIV.</td><td>
 They hence, by strange and solitary way,<br>
 Rove, as the beldam does her will betoken,<br>
 Nor climbing, nor descending hill, survey<br>
 Each other’s face, nor any word is spoken.<br>
 But when the sun upon the middle day<br>
 Had turned his back, their silence first was broken<br>
 By cavalier encountered in their way:<br>
 What followed the ensuing strain will say.</td></tr>
