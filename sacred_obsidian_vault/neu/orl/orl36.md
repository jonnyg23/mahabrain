 Rogero heard the call in joyous vein,<br>

 Craved, if to him was known that cavalier.</td></tr>

 “The damsel equals well, so Rumour tells,<br>
 Rinaldo, and every paladin in fray.<br>

 As the sky reddens with the morning ray,<br>

 And his heart throbs, nor knows he what to do.</td></tr>

 Stung, at these tidings, by the amorous dart—<br>

 Shoots through his bones a chill, produced by fear;<br>

 That mighty love, wherewith she burned whilere.<br>
 Confused he stands, irresolute and slow,<br>

 She leapt upon her horse, and thither hied<br>

 Would make her prisoner, and but schemed to guide<br>
 Her lance in mode the stripling least to pain.<br>

 Less with desire to lay her rival low,<br>
 Than with the lance to pierce her in mid breast,<br>
 And put her every jealousy at rest.</td></tr>

 Parforce to ground must go the royal maid,<br>
 To prove it hard or soft the listed plain,<br>

 To pride and every churlishness inclined.”<br>
 Marphisa, at these words, was heard to groan,<br>
 As roars in some sea-rock the prisoned wind.<br>
 She screamed an answer; but its sense was drowned<br>
 (Such rage confused that damsel) in the sound.</td></tr>

 She whirls this while her faulchion, and would fain<br>
 Wound horse or rider in the paunch or breast;<br>
 But Aymon’s watchful daughter turns the rein;<br>
 And on one side her courser leaps; possest<br>
 With furious anger and with fierce disdain,<br>
 She at her opposite her lance addrest;<br>
 And hardly touched the damsel, ere, astound,<br>
 Marphisa fell, reversed upon the ground.</td></tr>

 Scarce down, Marphisa started from the plain,<br>
 Intent fell mischief with her sword to do,<br>
 Bradamant couched her golden spear again,<br>
 And yet again the damsel overthrew.<br>
 Yet Bradamant, though blest with might and main,<br>
 Was not so much the stronger of the two<br>
 As to have flung the maid in every just,<br>
 But that such power was in the lance’s thrust.</td></tr>

 This while some knights (some knights upon our side,<br>
 I say) forth issuing from the city, go<br>
 Towards the field of strife, which did divide<br>
 The squadrons, here and there, of either foe<br>

 Their knight, but whom no otherwise they knew<br>

 Forth from the ramparts, at the monarch’s call.<br>

 Balked of the battle by Marphisa’s haste.</td></tr>

 The enamoured youth, with beating heart, intent,<br>
 Stood by, the issue of the just to view.<br>

 On mischief, fiercely closed the furious two:<br>
 But when that duel’s turn the stripling eyes,<br>
 He stands amazed and stupid with surprize;</td></tr>

 And when he saw unfinished was the fight,<br>
 At the first onset, like the justs whilere,<br>
 Misdoubting some strange accident, in sprite,<br>
 Sore vexed, this while remained the cavalier.<br>
 To either maid wished well that youthful knight;<br>
 For both were loved, but not alike were dear.<br>
 For this the stripling’s love was fury, fire;<br>
 For that ’twas rather fondness than desire.</td></tr>

 If so Rogero could with honour do,<br>

 Esteeming him the better of the two,<br>
 Break in between and turn their arms aside;<br>
 Upon the other part, the Christian foes<br>
 Advance, and both divisions come to blows.</td></tr>

 On this side and that other, rings the alarm,<br>
 Which in those camps is sounded every day,<br>
 Bidding the unmounted mount, the unarmed arm,<br>
 And all their standards seek, without delay,<br>
 Where, under separate flags, the squadrons swarm,<br>
 More than one shrilling trump is heard to bray;<br>
 And as their rattling notes the riders call,<br>
 Rousing the foot, beat drum and ataball.</td></tr>

 As fierce as thought could think, ’twixt either host<br>

 Hoping to see the youth for whom she sighs.</td></tr>

 The warrior’s manly shoulders and his breast,<br>
 Fair face and movements full of graceful shew;<br>

 Thinking another joys the stripling’s love,<br>
 Thus speaks, as sovereign rage and fury move.</td></tr>

 Her further meaning well did he divine,<br>
 Weening that him she in that speech would blame,<br>

 Of his desire for parley made a sign:<br>
 But she, with vizor closed, already came,<br>
 Raging and grieved, intent, with vengeful hand,<br>
 To fling the youth; nor haply upon sand.</td></tr>

 Rogero, when he saw her so offended,<br>
 Fixed himself firmly in his arms and seat,<br>

 Pitiless, and inflamed with furious heat,<br>
 Has not the courage, when she sees him near,<br>
 To fling, or do him outrage with the spear.</td></tr>

 Void of effect, ’tis thus their lances go;<br>
 And it is well; since Love with burning dart,<br>
 Tilting this while at one and the other foe,<br>

 Would she not, could she not, she nought replied,<br>
 But spurred aslant the ready Rabicane,<br>
 And, signing to Rogero, rode as wide<br>
 As she could wend from that embattled train;<br>

 Wherein embosomed was a little plain.<br>
 In the mid lawn a wood of cypress grew,<br>
 Whose saplings of one stamp appeared to view.</td></tr>

 And overtook that damsel in the wood.</td></tr>

 Rogero, after that strange knight to speed;<br>
 Nor deemed the youth pursued in love; she thought<br>
 He but to end their strife and quarrel sought.</td></tr>

 Unsheathes the sword, and from her courser springs.</td></tr>

 Meaning to cleave the brainpan of her foe:<br>
