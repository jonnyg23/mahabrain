 Beside a church, the martial damsels twain<br>
 Behold a pillar, standing in the square;<br>
 Whereon the wicked lord of the domain<br>
 Had graved that mad and cruel law; the pair,<br>
 In imitation, his helm, plate, and chain,<br>
 And shield, in guise of trophy fasten there;<br>
 And afterwards upon the pillar trace<br>
 That law they had enacted for the place.</td></tr>

 Within the town the troop set up their rest,<br>
 Until the law is graved, of different frame<br>
 From that before upon the stone imprest,<br>
 Which every woman doom’d to death and shame.<br>
 With the intention to replace her vest,<br>
 Here from that band divides the Islandick dame;<br>
 Who deems, at court ’twere shameful to appear,<br>
 Unless adorned and mantled as whilere.</td></tr>

 Here Ulany remained, and in her power<br>
 Remained the wicked tyrant Marganor:<br>
 She, lest he any how, in evil hour,<br>
 Should break his bonds and injure damsel more,<br>
 Made him, one day, leap headlong from a tower,<br>
 Who never took so still a leap before.<br>
 No more of her and hers! I of the crew<br>
 That journey toward Arles, the tale pursue.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXII.</td><td>
 Throughout all that and the succeeding day,<br>
 Till the forenoon, proceed those banded friends;<br>
 And, where the main-road branches, and one way<br>
 Towards the camp, to Arles the other tends,<br>
 Again embrace the lovers, and oft say<br>
 A last farewell, which evermore offends.<br>
 The damsels seek the camp; to Arles is gone<br>
 Rogero; and my canto I have done.</td></tr>
