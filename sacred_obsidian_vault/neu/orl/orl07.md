 Rogero, as directed by the pair,<br>

 More than one knight is tied and prisoned, goes.<br>

 And remedy for that grave evil shows.<br>
 Whence he, by her advised, with downcast eye,<br>
 And full of shame forthwith resolves to fly.</i></small></td></tr>

 T<small>HE</small> traveller, he, whom sea or mountain sunder<br>
 From his own country, sees things strange and new;<br>
 That the misjudging vulgar, which lies under<br>
 The mist of ignorance, esteems untrue:<br>
 Rejecting whatsoever is a wonder,<br>
 Unless ’tis palpable and plain to view:<br>
 Hence inexperience, as I know full well,<br>

 But this be great or small, I know not why<br>

 In whom the light of reason shines so clear.<br>
 And hence to you it is I only try<br>
 The fruit of my fatigues to render dear.<br>
 I ended where Eriphila in guard<br>
 Of bridge and stream was seen, the passage barred.</td></tr>

 Of finest metal was her armour bright,<br>
 With gems of many colours overspread,<br>
 The tawny jacinth, yellow chyrsolite,<br>
 The emerald green of hue, and ruby red.<br>
 Mounted, but not on palfrey, for the fight:<br>
 In place of that, she on a wolf had sped,<br>
 Sped on a wolf towards the pass; and rode<br>
 On sell, that rich beyond all custom showed.</td></tr>

 No larger wolf, I ween, Apulia roams;<br>

 Docile, I know not why, to her command.<br>

 Above her arms, in colour like the sand;<br>
 That, saving in its dye, was of the sort<br>
 Which bishops and which prelates wear at court.</td></tr>

 The giantess’s crest and shield appear,<br>
 For ensign, decked with swoln and poisonous toad.<br>
 Her the two damsels to the cavalier<br>
 Before the bridge, prepared for battle, showed,<br>
 Threatening, as wont to some, with levelled spear,<br>
 To do the warrior scorn and bar the road.<br>
 Bidding him turn, she to Rogero cries;<br>
 A lance he takes, and threats her and defies.</td></tr>

 As quick and daring, the gigantic Pest<br>
 Spurred her wolf, seated well for that dread game:<br>
 In mid career she laid her lance in rest,<br>
 And made earth quake beneath her as she came;<br>
 Yet at the encounter fierce the champaign pressed;<br>
 For underneath the casque, with stedfast aim, <br>
 So hard Rogero smote her, that he bore<br>
 The beldam backward six good yards and more:</td></tr>

 And came already with his lifted blade,<br>
 Drawn for that end, to take her haughty head;<br>
 To him an easy task; for she was laid<br>
 Among the grass and flowers, like one that’s dead.<br>

 The pair: “No further press thy vengeance dread.<br>
 Sheathe, courteous cavalier, thy sword anew:<br>
 Pass we the river, and our way pursue.”</td></tr>

 Along the path, which through a forest lay,<br>
 Roughish and somedeal ill to beat, they went.<br>
 Besides that strait and stony was the way,<br>
 This, nigh directly, scaled a hill’s ascent.<br>
 But, when arrived upon the summit, they<br>
 Issued upon a mead of vast extent;<br>
 And a more pleasant palace on that green<br>
 Beheld, and brighter than was ever seen.</td></tr>

 And on the knight with such deep reverence wait,<br>
 They could not have displayed more zeal and love,<br>
 Had Jove descended from the choirs above.</td></tr>

 Not so much does the palace, fair to see,<br>
 In riches other princely domes excel,<br>
 As that the gentlest, fairest, company<br>
 Which the whole world contains, within it dwell:<br>
 Of either sex, with small variety<br>
 Between, in youth and beauty matched as well:<br>
 The fay alone exceeds the rest as far<br>
 As the bright sun outshines each lesser star.</td></tr>

 Her shape is of such perfect symmetry,<br>
 As best to feign the industrious painter knows,<br>
 With long and knotted tresses; to the eye<br>
 Not yellow gold with brighter lustre glows.<br>
 Upon her tender cheek the mingled dye<br>
 Is scattered, of the lily and the rose.<br>
 Like ivory smooth, the forehead gay and round<br>
 Fills up the space, and forms a fitting bound.</td></tr>

 Two black and slender arches rise above<br>
 Two clear black eyes, say suns of radiant light,<br>
 Which ever softly beam and slowly move;<br>
 Round these appears to sport in frolic flight,<br>
 Hence scattering all his shafts, the little Love,<br>
 And seems to plunder hearts in open sight.<br>
 Thence, through mid visage, does the nose descend,<br>
 Where Envy finds not blemish to amend.</td></tr>

 As if between two vales, which softly curl,<br>
 The mouth with vermeil tint is seen to glow:<br>
 Within are strung two rows of orient pearl,<br>

 Of force to melt the heart of any churl,<br>
 However rude, hence courteous accents flow;<br>
 And here that gentle smile receives its birth,<br>
 Which opes at will a paradise on earth.</td></tr>

 Like milk the bosom, and the neck of snow;<br>
 Round is the neck, and full and large the breast;<br>
 Where, fresh and firm, two ivory apples grow,<br>
 Which rise and fall, as, to the margin pressed<br>
 By pleasant breeze, the billows come and go.<br>
 Not prying Argus could discern the rest.<br>
 Yet might the observing eye of things concealed<br>
 Conjecture safely, from the charms revealed.</td></tr>

 To all her arms a just proportion bear,<br>

 Which narrow is, and somedeal long; and where<br>
 No knot appears, nor vein is signified.<br>

 A foot, neat, short, and round, beneath is spied.<br>
 Angelic visions, creatures of the sky,<br>
 Concealed beneath no covering veil can lie.</td></tr>

 A springe is planted in Rogero’s way,<br>

 Of which the offended myrtle told above.<br>
 Nor will he think that perfidy and guile<br>
 Can be united with so sweet a smile.</td></tr>

 No! he could now believe, by magic art,<br>
 Astolpho well transformed upon the plain,<br>
 For punishment of foul ungrateful heart,<br>
 And haply meriting severer pain.<br>
 And, as for all he heard him late impart,<br>
 ’Twas prompted by revenge, ’twas false and vain.<br>
 By hate and malice was the sufferer stung,<br>
 To blame and wound the fay with slanderous tongue.</td></tr>

 The beauteous lady whom he loved so well<br>
 Is newly banished from his altered breast;<br>
 For (such the magic of Alcina’s spell)<br>
 She every ancient passion dispossessed;<br>
 And in his bosom, there alone to dwell,<br>
 The image of her love, and self impressed.<br>
 So witched, Rogero sure some grace deserves,<br>
 If from his faith his frail affection swerves.</td></tr>

 At board lyre, lute and harp of tuneful string,<br>
 And other sounds, in mixed diversity,<br>
 Made, round about, the joyous palace ring,<br>
 With glorious concert and sweet harmony.<br>
 Nor lacked there well-accorded voice to sing<br>
 Of love, its passion and its ecstasy;<br>
 Nor who, with rare inventions, choicely versed,<br>
 Delightful fiction to the guests rehearsed.</td></tr>

 What table, spread by whatsoever heir<br>
 Of Ninus, though triumphant were the board,<br>
 Or what more famous and more costly, where<br>
 Cleopatra feasted with the Latian lord,<br>
 Could with this banquet’s matchless joys compare,<br>
 By the fond fairy for Rogero stored?<br>
 I think not such a feast is spread above,<br>
 Where Ganymede presents the cup to Jove.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXI.</td><td>
 They form a ring, the board and festive cheer<br>
 Removed, and sitting, play a merry game:<br>
 Each asks, still whispering in a neighbour’s ear,<br>
 What secret pleases best; to knight and dame<br>
 A fair occasion, without let or fear,<br>
 Their love, unheard of any, to proclaim.<br>
 And in conclusion the two lovers plight<br>
 Their word, to meet together on that night.</td></tr>

 Soon, and much sooner than their wont, was ended<br>
 The game at which the palace inmates play:<br>
 When pages on the troop with torches tended,<br>
 And with their radiance chased the night away.<br>
 To seek his bed the paladin ascended,<br>
 Girt with that goodly squadron, in a gay<br>
 And airy bower, appointed for his rest,<br>
 Mid all the others chosen as the best.</td></tr>

 And when of comfits and of cordial wine<br>
 A fitting proffer has been made anew,<br>
 The guests their bodies reverently incline,<br>
 And to their bowers depart the courtly crew.<br>
 He upon perfumed sheets, whose texture fine<br>
 Seemed of Arachne’s loom, his body threw:<br>
 Hearkening this while with still attentive ears,<br>
 If he the coming of the lady hears.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIV.</td><td>
 At every movement heard on distant floor,<br>
 Hoping ’twas her, Rogero raised his head:<br>
 He thinks he hears; but it is heard no more,<br>
 Then sighs at his mistake: ofttimes from bed<br>
 He issued, and undid his chamber door,<br>
 And peeped abroad, but still no better sped;<br>
 And cursed a thousand times the hour that she<br>
 So long retarded his felicity.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXV.</td><td>
 “Yes, now she comes,” the stripling often said,<br>
 And reckoned up the paces, as he lay,<br>
 Which from her bower where haply to be made<br>
 To that where he was waiting for the fay.<br>
 These thoughts, and other thoughts as vain, he weighed<br>
 Before she came, and restless at her stay,<br>
 Often believed some hinderance, yet unscanned,<br>
 Might interpose between the fruit and hand.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXVI.</td><td>
 At length, when dropping sweets the costly fay<br>
 Had put some end to her perfumery,<br>
 The time now come she need no more delay,<br>
 Since all was hushed within the palace, she<br>
 Stole from her bower alone, through secret way,<br>
 And passed towards the chamber silently,<br>
 Where on his couch the youthful cavalier<br>
 Lay, with a heart long torn by Hope and Fear.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXVII.</td><td>
 When the successor of Astolpho spies<br>
 Those smiling stars above him, at the sight<br>
 A flame, like that of kindled sulphur, flies<br>
 Through his full veins, as ravished by delight<br>
 Out of himself; and now up to the eyes<br>
 Plunged in a sea of bliss, he swims outright.<br>
 He leaps from bed and folds her to his breast,<br>
 Nor waits until the lady he undressed;</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXVIII.</td><td>
 Though but in a light sendal clad, that she<br>
 Wore in the place of farthingale or gown;<br>
 Which o’er a shift of finest quality,<br>
 And white, about her limbs the fay had thrown:<br>
 The mantle yielded at his touch, as he<br>
 Embraced her, and that veil remained alone,<br>
 Which upon every side the damsel shows,<br>
 More than clear glass the lily or the rose.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIX.</td><td>
 The plant no closer does the ivy clip,<br>
 With whose green boughs its stem is interlaced.<br>
 Than those fond lovers, each from either’s lip<br>
 The balmy breath collecting, he embraced:<br>
 Rich perfume this, whose like no seed or slip<br>
 Bears in sweet Indian or Sabæan waste;<br>
 While so to speak their joys is either fixed,<br>
 That oftentimes those meeting lips are mixed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXX.</td><td>
 These things were carried closely by the dame<br>
 And youth, or if surmised, were never bruited;<br>
 For silence seldom was a cause for blame,<br>
 But oftener as a virtue well reputed.<br>
 By those shrewd courtiers, conscious of his claim,<br>
 Rogero is with proffers fair saluted:<br>
 Worshipped of all those inmates, who fulfil<br>
 In this the enamoured far, Alcina’s will.</td></tr>

 No pleasure is omitted there; since they<br>
 Alike are prisoners in Love’s magic hall.<br>
 They change their raiment twice or thrice a day,<br>
 Now for this use, and now at other call.<br>
 ’Tis often feast, and always holiday;<br>
 ’Tis wrestling, tourney, pageant, bath, and ball.<br>
 Now underneath a hill by fountain cast,<br>
 They read the amorous lays of ages past:</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXII.</td><td>
 Now by glad hill, or through the shady dale,<br>
 They hunt the fearful hare, and now they flush<br>
 With busy dog, sagacious of the trail,<br>
 Wild pheasant from the stubble-field or bush.<br>
 Now where green junipers perfume the gale,<br>
 Suspend the snare, or lime the fluttering thrush:<br>
 And casting now for fish, with net or hook,<br>
 Disturb their secret haunts in pleasant brook.</td></tr>

 Rogero revels there, in like delight,<br>
 While Charles and Agramant are troubled sore.<br>
 But not for him their story will I slight,<br>
 Nor Bradamant forget; who evermore,<br>
 Mid toilsome pain and care, her cherished knight,<br>
 Ravished from her, did many a day deplore;<br>
 Whom by unwonted ways, transported through<br>
 Mid air, the damsel saw, nor whither knew.</td></tr>

 Of her I speak before the royal pair,<br>
 Who many days pursued her search in vain;<br>
 By shadowy wood, or over champaign bare,<br>
 By farm and city, and by hill and plain;<br>
 But seeks her cherished friend with fruitless care,<br>
 Divided by such space of land and main:<br>
 Often she goes among the Paynim spears,<br>
 Yet never aught of her Rogero hears.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXV.</td><td>
 Of hundreds questioned, upon every side,<br>
 Each day, no answer ever gives content.<br>
 She roams from post to post, and far and wide<br>
 Searches pavilion, lodging, booth, or rent,<br>
 And this, mid foot or horsemen, unespied,<br>
 May safely do, without impediment,<br>
 Thanks to the ring, whose more than mortal aid,<br>
 When in her mouth, conceals the vanished maid.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXVI.</td><td>
 She cannot, will not, think that he is dead;<br>
 Because the wreck of such a noble knight<br>
 Would, from Hydaspes’ distant waves have spread,<br>
 To where the sun descends with westering light.<br>
 She knows not what to think, nor whither sped,<br>
 He roams in earth or air; yet, hapless wight,<br>
 Him ever seeks, and for attendant train<br>
 Has sobs and sighs, and every bitter pain.</td></tr>

 At length to find the wondrous cave she thought,<br>
 Where the prophetic homes of Merlin lie,<br>
 And there lament herself until she wrought<br>
 Upon the pitying marble to reply;<br>
 For thence, if yet he lived would she be taught,<br>
 Of this glad life to hard necessity<br>
 Had yielded up; and, when she was possessed<br>
 Of the seer’s councils, would pursue the best.</td></tr>

 With this intention, Bradamant her way<br>
 Directed thither, where in Poictier’s wood<br>
 The vocal tomb, containing Merlin’s clay,<br>
 Concealed in Alpine place and savage, stood.<br>

 Thought of the damsel, watchful for her good,<br>

 In that fair grotto her posterity;</td></tr>

 Spies daily what her thoughts and actions are,<br>
 And lots for her each day, divining, tries;—<br>

 Then borne to India by the griffin-steed:</td></tr>

 Him on that courser plainly she had eyed,<br>
 Who would not the controlling rein obey;<br>
 When, severed by such interval, he hied,<br>
 Borne through the perilous, unwonted way:<br>
 And knew that he sport, dance, and banquet plied,<br>
 And lapt in idleness and pleasure lay;<br>
 Nor memory of his lord nor of the dame,<br>
 Once loved so well, preserved, not of his fame.</td></tr>

 Wherefore defraud thy fair posterity<br>

 Pregnant by thee with an illustrious crew,<br>

 Destined the sun in glory to outshine?</td></tr>

 Abashed and mute, Rogero, listening,<br>
 In vain to her reproof an answer sought:<br>
 Who on his little finger put the ring,<br>
 Whose virtue to himself the warrior brought.<br>
 And such remorse and shame within him spring,<br>
 When on his altered sense the change is wrought,<br>
 A thousand fathoms deep he fain would lie<br>
 Buried in earth, unseen of any eye.</td></tr>

 Atlantes de Carena’s form; but she,<br>
 Seeing his health restored, now willed the youth,<br>
 Through her should hear and see the very truth.</td></tr>

 Sends for thy succour, and would send her heart,<br>
 If with such virtue fraught, her heart could bring<br>
 Thee safely in thy perils, like the ring.”</td></tr>

 Continuing to Rogero her relation:<br>
 To this, her worth commends with fitting praise,<br>
 Tempering in truth and fondness her narration;<br>
 And still employs the choicest mode and phrase,<br>
 Which fits one skilful in negociation,<br>
 And on the false Alcina brings such hate,<br>
 As on things horrible is wont to wait;</td></tr>

 Nor let the tale astonish which you hear,<br>
 For since his love was forced by magic lore,<br>
 The ring the false enchantment served to clear.<br>
 This too unmasked the charms Alcina wore,<br>
 And made all false, from head to food, appear.<br>
 None of her own, but borrowed, all he sees,<br>
 And the once sparkling cup now drugged with lees.</td></tr>

 And wonders that the hidden treasure shows,<br>
 Not what it is, but rotten and decayed;<br>
 And hates, and scorns, and loathes, with altered eyes,<br>
 And throws away what he was used to prize.</td></tr>

 Rogero thus, when by Melissa’s lore<br>
 Advised, he to behold the fay returned,<br>
 And that good ring of sovereign virtue wore,<br>
 Which, on the finger placed, all spells o’erturned;<br>
 For that fair damsel he had left before,<br>
 To his surprise, so foul a dame discerned,<br>
 That in this ample world, examined round,<br>
 A hag so old and hideous is not found.</td></tr>

 Pale, lean, and wrinkled was the face, and white,<br>
 And thinly clothed with hair Alcina’s head;<br>
 Her stature reached not to six palms in height,<br>
 And every tooth was gone; for she had led<br>
 A longer life than ever mortal wight,<br>
 Than Hecuba or she in Cuma bred;<br>
 But thus by practice, to our age unknown,<br>
 Appeared with youth and beauty not her own.</td></tr>

 By art she gave herself the lovely look,<br>
 Which had on many like Rogero wrought;<br>
 But now the ring interpreted the book,<br>
 Which secrets, hid for many ages, taught.<br>
 No wonder then that he the dame forsook,<br>
 And banished from his mind all further thought<br>
 Of love for false Alcina, found in guise<br>
 Which no new means of slippery fraud supplies.</td></tr>

 But, as Melissa counselled him, he wore<br>
 His wonted semblance for a time, till he<br>
 Was with his armour, many days before<br>
 Laid by, again accoutred cap-a-pee.<br>
 And, lest Alcina should his end explore,<br>
 Feigned to make proof of his agility;<br>
 Feigned to make proof if for his arms he were<br>
 Too gross, long time unwont the mail to bear.</td></tr>

 Next Balisarda to his flank he tied<br>
 (For so Rogero’s trenchant sword was hight),<br>
 And took the wondrous buckler, which, espied,<br>
 Not only dazzled the beholder’s sight,<br>
 But seemed, when its silk veil was drawn aside,<br>
 As from the body if exhaled the sprite:<br>
 In its close cover of red sendal hung,<br>
 This at his neck the youthful warrior slung.</td></tr>

 Provided thus, he to the stables came,<br>
 And bade with bridle and with saddle dight<br>
 A horse more black than pitch; for so the dame<br>
 Counselled, well-taught how swift the steed and light.<br>
 Him Rabicano those who know him name,<br>
 And he the courser was, that with the knight,<br>
 Who stands beside the sea, the breeze’s sport,<br>
 The whale of yore conducted to that port.</td></tr>

 ’Twas her intention from that realm to guide,<br>
 Where he should be instructed at his leisure,<br>
 To rein and run him every where at pleasure:</td></tr>

 Suspicion of the intended flight: The peer<br>
 This while performed Melissa’s every hest,<br>
 Who, still invisible, was at his ear.<br>
 So feigning, from the wanton dome possessed<br>
 By that old strumpet, rode the cavalier;<br>
 And pricking forth drew near unto a gate,<br>
 Whence the road led to Logistilla’s state.</td></tr>

 Assaulting suddenly the guardian crew,<br>
 He, sword in hand, the squadron set upon;<br>
 This one he wounded, and that other slew,<br>
 And, point by point made good, the drawbridge won:<br>
 And ere of his escape Alcina knew,<br>
 The gentle youth was far away and gone.<br>
 My next shall tell his route, and how he gained<br>
 At last the realm where Logistilla reigned.</td></tr>
