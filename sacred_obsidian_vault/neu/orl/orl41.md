 Now blows the wind in front, and now in rear,<br>
 And drives this wave an-end, that other back;<br>

 Signs to the crew the thing he would command.</td></tr>

 Calling for succour on unpitying skies:<br>
 But for short space that shrilling cry they rear;<br>

 Springs upward to the surface from below;<br>

 Alas! for man’s deceitful thoughts and blind!<br>

 So highly rated not the plate and chain<br>
