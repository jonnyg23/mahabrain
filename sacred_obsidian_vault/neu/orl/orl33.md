 Forthwith a solemn banquet they prepare<br>
 Within the gorgeous palace of the king.<br>
 Seated alone here guest and sovereign are,<br>
 And the attendant troop the viands bring.<br>
 Behold! a whizzing sound is heard in air,<br>
 Which echoes with the beat of savage wing.<br>
 Behold! the band of harpies thither flies,<br>
 Lured by the scent of victual from the skies.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXX.</td><td>
 All bear a female face of pallid dye,<br>
 And seven in number are the horrid band;<br>
 Emaciated with hunger, lean, and dry;<br>
 Fouler than death; the pinions they expand<br>
 Ragged, and huge, and shapeless to the eye;<br>
 The talon crook’d; rapacious is the hand;<br>
 Fetid and large the paunch; in many a fold,<br>
 Like snake’s, their long and knotted tails are rolled.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXI.</td><td>
 The fowls are heard in air; then swoops amain<br>
 The covey well nigh in that instant, rends<br>
 The food, o’erturns the vessels, and a rain<br>
 Of noisome ordure on the board descends.<br>
 To stop their nostrils king and duke are fain;<br>
 Such an insufferable stench offends.<br>
 Against the greedy birds, as wrath excites,<br>
 Astolpho with his brandished faulchion smites.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXII.</td><td>
 At croup or collar now he aims his blow,<br>
 Now strikes at neck or pinion; but on all,<br>
 As if he smote upon a bag of tow,<br>
 The strokes without effect and languid fall.<br>
 This while nor dish nor goblet they forego;<br>
 Nor void those ravening fowls the regal hall,<br>
 Till they have feasted full, and left the food<br>
 Waste or polluted by their rapine rude.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXIII.</td><td>
 That king had firmly hoped the cavalier<br>
 Would from his royal seat the harpies scare.<br>
 He now, that hope foregone, with nought to cheer,<br>
 Laments, and sighs, and groans in his despair.<br>
 Of his good horn remembers him the peer,<br>
 Whose clangours helpful aye in peril are,<br>
 And deems his bugle were the fittest mean<br>
 To free the monarch from those birds unclean;</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXIV.</td><td>
 And first to fill their ears, to king and train,<br>
 With melted wax, Astolpho gives command;<br>
 That every one who hears the deafening strain<br>
 May not in panic terror fly the land.<br>
 He takes the reins, his courser backs again,<br>
 Grasps the enchanted bugle in his hand;<br>
 And to the sewer next signs to have the board<br>
 Anew with hospitable victual stored.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXV.</td><td>
 The meats he to an open galley bears,<br>
 And other banquet spreads on other ground.<br>
 Behold, as wont, the harpy-squad appears;<br>
 Astolpho quickly lifts the bugle’s round;<br>
 And (for unguarded are their harassed ears)<br>
 The harpies are not proof against the sound;<br>
 In terror form the royal dome they speed,<br>
 Nor meat nor aught beside the monsters heed.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXVI.</td><td>
 After them spurs in haste the valiant peer:<br>
 And on the winged courser forth is flown,<br>
 Leaving beneath him, in his swift career,<br>
 The royal castle and the crowded town;<br>
 The bugle ever pealing, far and near.<br>
 The harpies fly toward the torrid zone;<br>
 Nor light until they reach that loftiest mountain<br>
 Where springs, if anywhere, Nile’s secret fountain.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXVII.</td><td>
 Almost at that aërial mountain’s feet,<br>
 Deep under earth, extends a gloomy cell.<br>
 The surest pass for him, as they repeat,<br>
 That would at any time descend to hell.<br>
 Hither the predatory troop retreat,<br>
 As a safe refuge from the deafening yell.<br>
 As far, and farther than Cocytus’ shore<br>
 Descending, till that horn is heard no more.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">CXXVIII.</td><td>
 At that dark hellish inlet, which a way<br>
 Opens to him who would abandon light,<br>
 The terrifying bugle ceased to bray;<br>
 —The courser furled his wings and stopt his flight.<br>
 But, ere Astolpho further I convey,<br>
 —Not to depart from my accustomed rite—<br>
 Since on all sides the paper overflows,<br>
 I shall conclude my canto and repose.</td></tr>
