 Orlando (as I oft have certified)<br>
 In fury, his had scattered wide and far;<br>
 Rodomont took the others’, which beside<br>
 The river, locked in that high turret are.<br>
 Few throughout Africa could they provide;<br>
 As well because to France, in that long war,<br>
 King Agramant had born away the best,<br>
 As because Africa but few possest.</td></tr>

 What could be had of armour, rusted o’er<br>
 And brown with age, Orlando bids unite;<br>
 Meanwhile with his companions on the shore,<br>
 He walks, discoursing on the future fight.<br>
 So wandering from their camp three miles and more,<br>
 It chanced that, turning towards the sea their sight,<br>
 Under full sail approaching, they descried<br>
 A helmless barque, with nought her course to guide.</td></tr>

 She, without pilot, without crew, alone,<br>
 As wind and fortune ordered it, was bound:<br>
 The vessel neared the shore, with sails full-blown,<br>
 Furrowing the waves, until she took the ground.<br>
 But ere of these three warriors more be shown,<br>
 The love wherewith I to the Child am bound,<br>
 To his story brings me back, and bids record<br>
 What past ’twixt him and Clermont’s warlike lord.</td></tr>

 I spake of that good pair of warriors, who<br>
 Had both retreated from the martial fray,<br>
 Beholding pact and treaty broken through,<br>
 And every troop and band in disarray.<br>
 Which leader to his oath was first untrue,<br>
 And was occasion of such evil, they<br>
 Study to learn of all the passing train;<br>
 King Agramant or the Emperor Charlemagne.</td></tr>

 Meanwhile a servant of the Child’s, at hand,<br>
 —Faithful, expert and wary was the wight,<br>
 Nor in the shock of either furious band,<br>
 Had ever of his warlike lord lost sight—<br>
 To bold Rogero bore his horse and brand,<br>
 That he might aid his comrades now in flight.<br>
 Rogero backed the steed and grasped the sword;<br>
 But not in battle mixed that martial lord.</td></tr>

 Thence he departed; but he first renewed<br>
 His compact with Montalban’s knight—that so<br>
 His Agramant convinced of perjury stood—<br>
 Him and his evil sect he would forego.<br>
 That day no further feats of hardihood<br>
 Rogero will perform against the foe:<br>
 He but demands of all that make for Arles,<br>
 Who first broke faith, King Agramant or Charles?</td></tr>

 From all he hears repeated, far and near,<br>
 That Agramant had broke the promise plight:<br>
 He loves that king, and from his side to veer,<br>
 For this, believes would be no error light.<br>
 The Moors were broke and scattered (this whilere<br>
 Has been rehearsed) and from the giddy height<br>
 Of HER revolving wheel were downward hurled,<br>
 Who at her pleasure rolls this nether world.</td></tr>

 Rogero ponders if he should remain,<br>
 Or rather should his sovereign lord attend:<br>
 Love for his lady fits him with a rein<br>
 And bit, which lets him not to Africk wend;<br>
 Wheels him, and to a counter course again<br>
 Spurs him, and threats his restive mood to shend,<br>
 Save he maintains the treaty, and the troth<br>
 Pledged to the paladin with solemn oath.</td></tr>

 A wakeful, stinging care, on the other side<br>
 Scourges and goads no less the cavalier;<br>
 Lest, if he now from Agramant divide,<br>
 He should be taxed with baseness or with fear.<br>
 If many deem it well he should abide,<br>
 To many and many it would ill appear:<br>
 Many would say, that oaths unbinding are,<br>
 Which ’tis unlawful and unjust to swear.</td></tr>

 He all that day and the ensuing night<br>
 Remains alone, and so the following day;<br>
 Forever sifting in his doubtful sprite,<br>
 If it be better to depart or stay:<br>
 Lastly for Agramant decides the knight;<br>
 To him in Africk will he wend his way:<br>
 Moved by his love for his liege-lady sore,<br>
 But moved by honour and by duty more.</td></tr>

 He made for Arles, where yet he hoped would ride<br>
 The fleet which him to Africa might bear;<br>
 Nor in the port nor offing ships espied,<br>
 Nor Saracens save dead beheld he there.<br>
 For Agramant had swept the roadstead wide,<br>
 And burnt what vessels in the haven were.<br>
 Rogero takes the road, when his hope fails,<br>
 Along the sea-beat shore toward Marseilles.</td></tr>

 Upon some boat he hoped to lay his hand,<br>
 Which him for love or force should thence convey.<br>
 Already Ogier’s son had made the land,<br>
 With the barbarians’ fleet, his captive prey.<br>
 You could not there have cast a grain of sand<br>
 Between those vessels; moored closely lay<br>
 The mighty squadrons to that harbour brought,<br>
 With conquerors these, and those with prisoners fraught.</td></tr>

 The vessels of the Moor that were not made<br>
 The food of fire and water on that night<br>

 Safe to Marseilles by the victorious knight<br>
 Seven of those kings, that Moorish sceptres swayed,<br>
 Who, having seen their squadron put to flight,<br>
 With their seven ships had yielded to the foe,<br>
 Stood mute and weeping, overwhelmed with woe.</td></tr>

 Dudon had issued forth upon dry land,<br>
 Bent to find Charlemagne that very day;<br>
 And of the Moorish spoil and captive band<br>
 Made in triumphal pomp a long display.<br>
 The prisoners all were ranged upon the strand,<br>
 And round them stood their Nubian victors gay;<br>
 Who, shouting in his praise, with loud acclaim,<br>
 Made all that region ring with Dudon’s name.</td></tr>

 Rogero, when from far the ships he spied,<br>
 Believed they were the fleet of Agramant,<br>
 And, to know further, pricked his courser’s side;<br>
 Then, nearer, mid those knights of mickle vaunt,<br>
 Nasamon’s king a prisoner he desired,<br>
 Agricalt, Bambirago, Farurant,<br>
 Balastro, Manilardo, and Rimedont;<br>
 Who stood with weeping eyes and drooping front.</td></tr>

 In their unhappy state to leave that crew<br>
 The Child, who loved those monarchs, cannot bear;<br>
 That useless is the empty hand he knew;<br>
 That where force is not, little profits prayer.<br>
 He couched his lance, their keeper overthrew,<br>
 Then proved his wonted might with faulchion bare;<br>
 And in a moment stretched upon the strand<br>
 Above a hundred of the Nubian band.</td></tr>

 The noise Sir Dudon hears, the slaughter spies,<br>
 But knows not who the stranger cavalier:<br>
 He marks how, put to rout, his people flies;<br>
 With anguish, with lament and mighty fear;<br>
 Quickly for courser, shield, and helmet cries,<br>
 (Bosom, and arms, and thighs, were mailed whilere)<br>
 Leaps on his horse, nor—having seized his lance—<br>
 Forgets he is a paladin of France.</td></tr>

 He called on every one to stand aside,<br>
 And with the galling spur his courser prest;<br>
 Meanwhile a hundred other foes have died,<br>
 And filled with hope was every prisoner’s breast;<br>
 And as Rogero holy Dudon spied<br>
 Approach on horseback, (footmen were the rest,)<br>
 Esteeming him their head, he charged the knight,<br>
 Impelled by huge desire to prove his might.</td></tr>

 Already, on his part, had moved the Dane;<br>
 But when he saw the Child without a spear,<br>
 He flang is own far from him, in disdain<br>
 To take such vantage of the cavalier.<br>
 Admiring at Sir Dudon’s courteous vein,<br>
 “Belie himself he cannot,” said the peer,<br>
 “And of those perfect warriors must be one<br>
 That as the paladins of France are known.</td></tr>

 “If I my will can compass, he shall shew<br>
 His name, to me, ere further deed be done.”<br>
 He made demand; and in the stranger knew<br>
 Dudon, the Danish Ogier’s valiant son:<br>
 He from Rogero claimed an equal due,<br>
 And from the Child as courteous answer won.<br>
 —Their names on either side announced—the foes<br>
 A bold defiance speak, and come to blows.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXIX.</td><td>
 Bold Dudon had with him that iron mace,<br>
 Which won him deathless fame in many a fight:<br>
 Wherewith he proved him fully of the race<br>
 Of that good Danish warrior, famed for might.<br>
 That best of faulchions, which through iron case<br>
 Of cuirass or of casque was wont to bite,<br>
 Youthful Rogero from the scabbard snatched,<br>
 And with the martial Dane his valour matched.</td></tr>

 But for the gentle youth was ever willed<br>
 To offend his lady-love the least he could,<br>
 And knew he should offend her, if he spilled,<br>
 In that disastrous battle, Dudon’s blood<br>

 He wist of Beatrice’s sisterhood,<br>
 —Bradamant’s mother she—with Armelline,<br>
 The mother of the Danish paladine).</td></tr>

 He therefore never thrust in that affray,<br>
 And rarely smote an edge on plate and chain.<br>
 Now warding off the mace, now giving way,<br>
 Before the fall of that descending bane.<br>
 Turpin believes it in Rogero lay<br>
 Sir Dudon in few sword-strokes to have slain.<br>
 Yet never when the Dane his guard foregoes,<br>
 Save on the faulchion’s flat descend the blows.</td></tr>

 The flat as featly as the edge he plies,<br>
 Of that good faulchion forged of stubborn grain;<br>
 And, at strange blindman’s bluff, in weary wise,<br>
 Hammers on Dudon with such might and main,<br>
 He often dazzles so the warrior’s eyes,<br>
 That hardly he his saddle can maintain.<br>
 But to win better audience for my rhyme,<br>
 My canto I defer to other time.</td></tr>
