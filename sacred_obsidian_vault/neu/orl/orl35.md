 With wonted kindness cried that dame, “I ne’er<br>
 In spending life itself, not words alone,<br>
 Should weary in your service; since whilere<br>
 You would in my behalf as much have done.”<br>
 Her Aymon’s daughter thanked in courteous strain,<br>

 Through long days’ journey, by that river-shore,<br>

 Of billows breaking on the sea-beach bare.<br>
 Almost without the suburbs, and before<br>
 The furthest barrier, stops the martial fair;<br>
 To furnish Flordelice what time might need<br>
 For the conveyance of Rogero’s steed.</td></tr>

 To young Rogero’s inn; and there descended.<br>

 And gave the courser, to her care commended:<br>
 Then (for she waits not for an answer) speeds<br>
 In haste to execute her proper needs.</td></tr>

 Rogero stands confused; he finds no end<br>
 To his perplexing thoughts, and cannot see<br>
 Who should defy him, who that message send,<br>
 To speak him ill, and do him courtesy.<br>
 Who thus as faithless him should reprehend,<br>
 Or any reprehend, whoe’er it be,<br>
 Nor knows he nor imagines; least of all<br>
 On Bradamant the knight’s suspicions fall.</td></tr>

 Serpentine stood by chance before the two,<br>

 The Moorish king, that on the rampart’s height<br>

 Marking the joust, much marvelled at the sight<br>
 Of the foe’s courtesy to him of Spain.<br>

 Bradamant’s sharp and stinging answer stirred<br>
 The paynim’s fury to a mighty flame;<br>
 So that, without the power to speak a word,<br>
 He wheeled his courser, filled with rage and shame;<br>

 Her horse with levelled lance the warlike dame.<br>
 As the charmed weapon smites Grandonio’s shield,<br>
 With heels in air, he tumbles on the field.</td></tr>

 “Rogero”; and pronounced the word with pain.<br>

 All over with the rose’s crimson grain.<br>

 Discoursing all this while, the martial maid<br>

 “Return, and keep thy word with me as bound.”<br>
 Shamed, he returned, and by his monarch’s side,<br>

 The rest dismounted, makes his spirit quail.<br>
 But how he armed, how sallied, what befell<br>
 That knight, in other canto will I tell.</td></tr>
