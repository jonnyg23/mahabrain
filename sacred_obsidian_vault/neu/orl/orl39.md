 Rinaldo, unimpeded by such thought,<br>
 Strove in all ways Rogero to o’erthrow;<br>
 Fierce and despiteous whirled his axe, and sought<br>
 Now in the arms, now head, to wound the foe.<br>
 Rogero circled here and there, and caught<br>
 Upon his weapon’s shaft the coming blow;<br>
 And, if ever smote, aye strove to smite<br>
 Where he should injure least Montalban’s knight.</td></tr>

 He sighed, and breathless gazed upon the fray;<br>
 And all the blame of that ill counsel flung<br>
 On King Sobrino’s head, from whom it sprung.</td></tr>

 Meanwhile the weird Melissa, she—the font<br>

 And seemed, like him, in dragon’s hide to go:<br>
 Such was her belied sword and such her shield;<br>
 Nor aught was wanting which he wore afield.</td></tr>

 Each for a hundred stands when I am here.”<br>

 That king pressed forward without further thought.</td></tr>
