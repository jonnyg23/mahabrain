 For her lieutenant left Hypocrisy.</td></tr>

 A little dwarf, attending as a guide;<br>
 Who erst had been sent forward with advice<br>
 To Sarza’s king, by beauteous Doralice.</td></tr>

 The tale her messenger was charged to bear,<br>
 But wonderous deeds be done for her relief,<br>
 With sad and signal vengeance on the thief.</td></tr>

 Jealousy had that little dwarf espied,<br>
 And kenned the reason of his mission too,<br>
 And joined him, journeying with him side by side,<br>
 Deeming that she therein a part might do.<br>
 Discord, with pleasure, Jealousy decried,<br>
 But with more joy, when she the occasion knew<br>
 Which thither brought the dame, who much (she wist)<br>
 Might in the task she had in hand assist.</td></tr>

 Of means to embroil the Sarzan and the son<br>
 Of Agrican, she deems herself possest.<br>
 A certain mode to enrage these two is won;<br>

 Where the fierce Pagan in his clutch had prest<br>
 Proud Paris, and they reached the river strand,<br>
 Exactly as the felon swam to land.</td></tr>

 Save that a wight had wrought him scaith and shame,<br>
 And cries (encountering him with chearful brow)<br>
 “How fares our lady? wither sent art thou?”</td></tr>

 “Nor mine nor thine that lady will I say,<br>
 Who is another’s thrall,” the dwarf replied.<br>
 “We, on our road, encountered yesterday<br>
 A knight, who seized and bore away the bride.”<br>

 And, cold as asp, embraced the king: her guide<br>
 Pursued his tale, relating how the train,<br>
 Their mistress taken, by one man were slain.</td></tr>

 Her flint and steel, fell Discord, as he said,<br>
 Took forth, and somewhile hammered on the stone.<br>
 Pride, underneath, the ready tinder spread,<br>
 And the quick fire was in a moment blown:<br>
 This on the paynim’s soul so fiercely fed,<br>
 He could not find a resting place: ’mid groan<br>
 And sob he storms, with horrid face and eye,<br>
 Which threat the elements and ample sky.</td></tr>

 As tiger rages, who in vain descends<br>
 Into her den, and finds herself alone,<br>
 And, circling all the cavern, comprehends,<br>
 At last, that her beloved young are gone;<br>
 To ire, to rage like hers his wrath extends:<br>
 Nor night the king regards, nor rock, nor stone,<br>
 Nor stream:—Nor length of way nor storm arrest<br>
 The speed with which he on the plunderer prest.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXVI.</td><td>
 So raging, to the pigmy dwarf who bore<br>
 The news, exclaimed the king, “Now hence away!”<br>
 Nor horse he waits, nor carriage, nor, before<br>
 Departing, deigns to his a word to say.<br>
 He hurries with such speed, that not with more<br>
 The lizard darts at noon across the way.<br>
 Horse had he none, but be he whose he might,<br>
 Would make his own the first which came in sight.</td></tr>

 Discord at this, who read his secret thought,<br>
 Exclaimed, as she looked smilingly on Pride,<br>
 Through her he to a courser should be brought,<br>
 By which new cause of strife should be supplied;<br>
 And, that by him no other might be caught,<br>
 She from his path would keep all steeds beside;<br>
 And knew already where the prize to seek.<br>

 When, on the Saracen’s departure, spent,<br>
 About King Charles, was the consuming flame,<br>

 To give the foe checkmate and end the game;<br>
 And from St. German’s to Saint Victor’s gates,<br>

 In guise, that for a record should remain,<br>

 Devours and rends, and swallows, and lays dead<br>
 The feeble flock, which at his mercy are;<br>

 Guarding the side that each is camped upon.<br>
