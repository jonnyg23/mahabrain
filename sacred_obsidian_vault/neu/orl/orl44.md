 Rinaldo his sister to the Child hath plight,<br>

 Hence it ensues that peace and pact between<br>

 But to their profit look the faithless throng.</td></tr>

 In his retreat that ancient eremite<br>

 Rinaldo more than all that lordly train<br>

 Welcome, with endless proffers, on his side,<br>

 The heir and hope, to crave the maid had sent.<br>
 Such warmth the praises of her worth inspired,<br>

 To him hath Aymon answered: he, alone,<br>

 The turbid and tempestuous southern wind.</td></tr>

 Things lost on earth, of sound deprived his horn:<br>
