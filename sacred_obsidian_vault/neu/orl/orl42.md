 The victory with Count Orlando lies;<br>

 For young Rogero) suffer cruel smart.<br>

 Towards Italy, and is with courteous cheer<br>

 Orlando levels at his better side,<br>
 Beneath the lowest rib, his faulchion bright;<br>

 Better than whom in Paynimry was none.</td></tr>

 Here as my story stood not on good ground,<br>

 Erewhile on board a squadron, landed here;<br>

 In all its parts so mountainous and drear,<br>
 There is not (through the land) a level space<br>
 (He says) whereon a single boot to place.</td></tr>

 Erewhile a place, well fit for such careers,<br>
 Stretched at the bottom of the hills did lie;<br>
 But afterwards, o’erthrown by earthquake’s shock,<br>
 A cliff o’erspread the plain with broken rock.</td></tr>

 So, of Fulgoso’s race thou shining ray,<br>

 All haste, and wholly leans to kind accord,<br>
 Prythee delay not to declare, that I<br>
 In this my story haply tell no lie.</td></tr>

 Under full sail a nimble bark appeared,<br>
 As if she to that island would repair.<br>

 At having chased the Saracens, or sad;</td></tr>

 Made in the hearing of those armies two,<br>
 Upon the Christian and the paynim side;<br>
 Since he again had failed her, there was nought<br>
 Wherein she could confide, the damsel thought.</td></tr>

 And now her too accustomed plaint and wail<br>
 Repeating, of Rogero’s cruelty<br>

 Heaven that consented to such perjury,<br>
 —And did not yet by some plain token speak—<br>

 Her woes, and told her brother’s perfidy;<br>

 With tears and outcries, succour at her hands.</td></tr>

 Or he shall keep the word, which he engaged.</td></tr>

 For wholly broken was the infidel:<br>
 Alone amid the victors, he, of all<br>
 The paladins, remained Love’s captive thrall.</td></tr>

 To seek her he a hundred couriers sent,<br>
 And sought as well, himself, the missing maid:<br>

 On earth, and visage crimsoned o’er; and prayed<br>
 That sage magicians to instruct him, where<br>
 He in the world might find the long-sought fair.</td></tr>

 A case, so strange and wondrous, marvel sore<br>

 And he himself, to move the knight or yore,<br>
 In her behalf, enough had done and said:<br>
 Had him by prayer and menace sought to bend,<br>
 Yet ne’er was able to obtain his end;</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXII.</td><td>
 And so much more, that out of prison ward<br>
 He then would Malagigi so have brought.<br>
 Now will he seek her, of his own accord,<br>
 On less occasion, when it profits nought.<br>
 Next that magician Montalbano’s lord<br>
 To mark how sorely do had erred, besought:<br>
 Since little lacked, but through the boon denied,<br>
 Erewhile he had in gloomy dungeon died.</td></tr>

 But how much more Rinaldo’s strange demand<br>
 Sounded importunately in his ear,<br>
 So by sure index Malagigi scanned,<br>

 Rinaldo prayer unable to withstand,<br>
 In ocean sunk the wizard cavalier<br>
 All memory of old injury assaid,<br>
 And bowned himself to give the warrior aid.</td></tr>

 For his reply he craved some small delay,<br>
 And with fair hope consoled Mount Alban’s knight,<br>

 By which Angelica had sped her flight,<br>
 In France or wheresoe’er; then wends his way<br>
 Thither where he is wont his imps to cite;<br>
 A grot impervious and with mountains walled:<br>
 His book he opened and the spirits called.</td></tr>

 Then one he chooses, in love-cases read,<br>
 Whom Malagigi to declare requires,<br>
 How good Rinaldo’s heart, before so died,<br>
 Was now so quickly moved by soft desires;<br>
 And of those fountains twain (the demon said)<br>
 Whereof one lights, one quenches amorous fires;<br>
 And how nought cures the mischief caused by one<br>
 But that whose streams in counter current run;</td></tr>

 And says, Rinaldo, having drunk whilere<br>
 From the love-chasing fountain’s mossy urn,<br>
 To Angelica, that long had wooed the peer,<br>

 To drink of that which makes the bosom burn,<br>
 Her whom but just before he loathed above<br>
 All reason, by that draught was forced to love.</td></tr>

 Him his ill star and cruel fate conveyed<br>
 To swallow fire and flame i’ the frozen lake:<br>
 For nigh at the same time the Indian maid<br>
 In the other bitter stream her thirst did slake;<br>
 Which in her bosom so all love allayed,<br>
 Henceforth she loathed him more than noisome snake;<br>
 He loved her, and such love was his, as late<br>
 Rinaldo bore her enmity and hate.</td></tr>

 Of this strange story fully certified<br>

 She had abandoned Europe’s every shore;<br>
 And hoisting her bold canvas to the wind,<br>
 In Catalonian galley loosed for Ind.</td></tr>
