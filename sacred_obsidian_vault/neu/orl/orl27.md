 By good Rogero and those paynims three<br>
 Defeated, Charlemagne to Paris flies.<br>
 Already all, throughout their chivalry,<br>
 Are mad with spite and hatred; jars arise,<br>
 And strife; and means to still their enmity<br>
 Their sovereign is unable to devise.<br>
 From him departs the monarch of Argier,<br>
 Who is rejected of his lady dear.</i></small></td></tr>

 That seemed good counsel, but was ill indeed<br>
