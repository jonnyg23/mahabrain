 Although a feeble rein, in mid career,<br>

 What reason then Rogero shall withhold<br>
 From taking with Angelica delight,—<br>
 That gentle maid, there naked in his hold,<br>
 In the lone forest, and secure from sight?<br>
 Of Bradamant he thinks not, who controlled<br>

 From her Brunello in Albracca bore.</td></tr>

 This is the ring she carried into France,<br>
 When thither first the damsel took her way;<br>
 With her the brother, bearer of the lance,<br>
 After, the paladin, Astolpho’s prey.<br>
 With this she Malagigi’s spells and trance<br>
 Made vain by Merlin’s stair; and on a day<br>
 Orlando freed, with many knights and good,<br>
 From Dragontina’s cruel servitude:</td></tr>

 With this passed viewless from the turret-cell,<br>

 Recount its different wonders, if as well<br>
 You know the virtues of the ring as I?<br>
 From her this even in her citadel,<br>
 His monarch Agramant to satisfy,<br>
 Brunello took: since where she had been crost<br>
 By Fortune, till her native realm was lost.</td></tr>

 Now that she this upon her hand surveys,<br>
 She is so full of pleasure and surprise,<br>
 She doubts it is a dream, and, in amaze,<br>
 Hardly believes her very hand and eyes.<br>
 Then softly to her mouth the hoop conveys,<br>
 And, quicker than the flash which cleaves the skies,<br>
 From bold Rogero’s sight her beauty shrowds,<br>
 As disappears the sun, concealed in clouds.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">VII.</td><td>
 Yet still Rogero gazed like wight distraught,<br>
 And hurried here and there with fruitless speed:<br>
 But when he had recalled the ring to thought,<br>
 Foiled and astounded, cursed his little heed.<br>
 And now the vanished lady, whom he sought,<br>
 Of that ungrateful and discourteous deed<br>
 Accusing stood, wherewith she had repaid,<br>
 (Unfitting recompense) his generous aid.</td></tr>

 Cruel, though answering not, I know you hear.”</td></tr>

 So saying, like one blind, with bootless care,<br>
 Feeling his way about the fount he strayed.<br>
 How often he embraced the empty air,<br>
 Hoping in this to have embraced the maid!<br>
 Meanwhile, now far removed, the flying fair<br>
 Had halted not, till to a cave conveyed.<br>
 Formed in a mountain was that harbour rude;<br>
 Spacious, and for her need supplied with food.</td></tr>

 His charge from the oppressive noon-tide sun;<br>

 Unseen of prying eyes, prolonged her stay;</td></tr>

 And about evening, when refreshed with rest<br>
 And food, she deemed her course she might renew;<br>
 In certain rustic weeds her body dressed:<br>
 How different from those robes of red, or blue,<br>
 Green, yellow, purple, her accustomed vest,<br>
 So various in its fashion, shape, and hue!<br>
 Yet her not so that habit misbecame,<br>
 But that she looked the fair and noble dame.</td></tr>

 To seek in the Levant her antient reign.</td></tr>

 This while Rogero, after he had passed<br>

 To his first ill addition grave and sore<br>
 Was to have lost the bird of rapid wing,<br>

 Afflicted beyond measure, he, with shield<br>
 Cast on his shoulder, and new-cased in mail,<br>
 Left the sea-side, and through a grassy field<br>
 Pursued his way, towards a spacious vale:<br>

 The widest and most beaten in the dale.<br>

 Ere on his right he heard a mighty din.</td></tr>

 He heard a din, and fearful clashing sound<br>
 Of arms, and hurrying on with eager pace<br>

 Waging fierce fight in close and straightened place:<br>
 Who to each other (warring on what ground<br>
 I know not) neither showed regard nor grace.<br>

 And one a bold and gallant cavalier.</td></tr>

 Covered with shield and sword, one, leaping, sped<br>

 Rogero paused, and to the strife attended:<br>
 And straight his wishes leant towards the knight,<br>
 Whom he would fain see conqueror in the fight:</td></tr>

 Yet not for this would lend the champion aid,<br>
 But to behold the cruel strife stood nigh.<br>
 Lo! a two-handed stroke the giant made<br>
 Upon the lesser warrior’s casque, and by<br>
 The mighty blow the knight was overlaid:<br>
 The other, when astound he saw him lie,<br>
 To deal the foe his death, his helm untied,<br>
 So that the warrior’s face Rogero spied.</td></tr>

 To sudden battle him the Child defies,<br>

 Takes the half-lifeless lady in his arm,</td></tr>

 And on his shoulder flings and bears away;<br>

 Or eagle in her crooked claws convey<br>
 Pigeon, or such-like bird, through liquid air.<br>
 Rogero runs with all the speed he may,<br>
 Who sees how needed is his succour there.<br>
 But with such strides the giant scours the plain,<br>
 Him with his eyes the knight pursues with pain.</td></tr>

 This flying and that following, the two<br>
 Kept a close path which widened still, and they<br>
 Piercing that forest, issued forth to view<br>
 On a wide meadow, which without it lay.<br>

 Oberto, though the Paladin to sight<br>
 Was dripping, and with water foul and gore;<br>
 With gore, that from the orc, emerged to light,<br>
 Whom he had entered bodily, he bore,<br>
 He for the country knew the stranger knight<br>
 As he perused his face; so much the more,<br>
 That he had thought when told the tidings, none<br>
 Save Roland could such mighty fear have done;</td></tr>

 Knew him, because a page of honour he<br>
 Had been in France, and for the crown, his right<br>
 Upon his father’s death, had crossed the sea<br>
 The year before. So often he the knight<br>
 Had seen, and had with him held colloquy,<br>
 Their times of meeting had been infinite.<br>
 He doffed his casque, with festive welcome pressed<br>
 Towards the count, and clasped him to the breast.</td></tr>

 Which had been done the youthful dame, and who<br>

 All men should least have sought to do her wrong.</td></tr>

 Had lost, and would in fine for him have died.<br>
 And how he this could warrant, and appear<br>
 To vouch for much, as witness on her side.<br>
 While thus to him her griefs Orlando showed,<br>
 The lady’s shining eyes with tears o’erflowed.</td></tr>

 Her face was such as sometimes in the spring<br>
 We see a doubtful sky, when on the plain<br>
 A shower descends, and the sun, opening<br>
 His cloudy veil, looks out amid the rain.<br>
 And as the nightingale then loves to sing<br>
 From branch of verdant stem her dulcet strain,<br>
 So in her beauteous tears his pinions bright<br>
 Love bathes, rejoicing in the chrystal light.</td></tr>

 The stripling heats his golden arrow’s head<br>
 At her bright eyes, then slacks the weapon’s glow<br>
 In streams, which falls between white flowers and red;<br>
 And, the shaft tempered, strongly draws his bow,<br>
 And roves at him, o’er whom no shield is spread,<br>
 Nor iron rind, nor double mail below;<br>
 Who, gazing on her tresses, eyes, and brow,<br>
 Feels that his heart is pierced, he knows not how.</td></tr>

 Olympia’s beauties are of those most rare,<br>
 Nor is the forehead’s beauteous curve alone<br>
 Excellent, and her eyes and cheeks and hair,<br>
 Mouth, nose, and throat, and shoulders; but, so down<br>
 Descending from the lady’s bosom fair,<br>
 Parts which are wont to be concealed by gown,<br>
 Are such, as haply should be placed before<br>
 Whate’er this ample world contains in store.</td></tr>

 Smooth ivory to the touch: above were seen<br>
 Two rounding paps, like new-pressed milk in show,<br>
 Fresh-taken from its crate of rushes green;<br>

 Which oftentimes we see small hills between,<br>
 Sweet in its season, and now such as when<br>
 Winter with snows has newly filled the glen.</td></tr>

 Some dame, to feed the beast, from countries round.<br>
