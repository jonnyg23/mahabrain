 He entered, ’twixt two hills, a narrow way,<br>

 Where he before him a dead knight espied.<br>
 Who I shall tell; but first I must away<br>
 From France, in the Levant to wander wide,<br>

 Who westward had his course from thence inclined.</td></tr>

 He had chased the unfaithful people in their fear,<br>
 And has preserved himself from peril sore;<br>

 Then sail, and fly with noted scorn that shore.<br>
 Now following him, I say, the warrior took<br>
 The Armenian road, and so that land forsook.</td></tr>

 A breeze which, from the starboard blowing light,<br>

 Now to the right, now to the other hand,<br>

 At last nigh Rouen; and forthwith, in chain<br>

 Bade put the saddle upon Rabicane;<br>

 And traversing a forest, at the feet<br>
 Of a fair hill, arrived beside a font,<br>

 Lifted the weighty morion from his front;<br>
 Tethered his courser in the thickest wood,<br>

 And, when he sees his mighty loss so clear,<br>
 Satiate, although he had not drunk, upstarts,<br>
 And after the young churl in fury darts.</td></tr>

 That robber did not let the courser strain<br>

 Of what the warrior had pursued is gone.<br>
 He neither Rabican nor thief can meet,<br>
 And vainly rolls his eyes and plies his feet.</td></tr>

 He plies his feet, and searches still in vain<br>
 Throughout the house, hall, bower, or galleried rows:<br>

 I’ the book, of that enchanted house at large<br>

 A spirit pent beneath the threshold lay;<br>
 And the stone raised which kept him fast below,<br>
 With him the palace into smoke would go.</td></tr>

 Astolpho with desire to bring to end<br>
 An enterprise so passing fair, delays<br>
 No more, but to the task his force does bend,<br>
 And prove how much the heavy marble weighs.<br>
 As old Atlantes sees the knight intend<br>
 To bring to scorn his art and evil ways,<br>
 Suspicious of the ill which may ensue,<br>
 He moves to assail him with enchantments new.</td></tr>

 The false enchanter wore, beholds the peer.<br>

 They, without fail, had laid Astolpho dead.</td></tr>

 He, having chased the enchanter Moor away,<br>
 Upraised the heavy threshold from the ground;<br>
 Beneath which, figures and more matters lay,<br>
 That I omit; desirous to confound<br>
 The spell which did the magic dome upstay,<br>
 The duke made havock of whate’er he found,<br>

 There he found fastened by a golden chain<br>
 Rogero’s famous courser, him I say<br>
 Given by the wizard, that to the domain<br>
 Of false Alcina him he might convey:<br>
 On which, equipt with Logistilla’s rein,<br>
 To France Rogero had retraced his way,<br>
 And had from Ind to England rounded all<br>
 The right-hand side of the terrestrial ball.</td></tr>

 I know not if you recollect how tied<br>
 To a tree Rogero left his rein, the day<br>
 Galaphron’s naked daughter from his side<br>
 Vanished, and him did with that scorn appay.<br>
 The courser, to his wonder who espied,<br>
 Returned to him whom he was used to obey;<br>
 Beneath the old enchanter’s care to dwell,<br>
 And stayed with him till broken was the spell.</td></tr>

 At nought Astolpho could more joyous be<br>
 Than this; of all things fortunate the best:<br>
 In that the hippogryph so happily<br>
 Offered himself; that he might scower the rest,<br>
 (As much he coveted) of land and sea,<br>
 And in few days the ample world invest.<br>
 Him well he knew, how fit for his behoof;<br>
 For of his feats he had elsewhere made proof.</td></tr>

 Him he that day in India proved, when sped<br>
 He was by sage Melissa, from the reign<br>
 Of that ill woman who him, sore bested,<br>
 Had changed from man to myrtle on the plain;<br>
 Had marked and noted how his giddy head<br>
 Was formed by Logistilla to the rein;<br>
 And saw how well instructed by her care<br>
 Rogero was, to guide him every where.</td></tr>

 Minded to take the hippogryph, he flung<br>
 The saddle on him, which lay near, and bitted<br>
 The steed, by choosing, all the reins among,<br>
 This part or that, until his mouth was fitted:<br>
 For in that place were many bridles hung,<br>
 Belonging to the coursers which flitted.<br>
 And now alone, intent upon his flight,<br>
 The thought of Rabicane detained the knight.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXIX.</td><td>
 Good cause he had to love that Rabicane,<br>
 For better horse was not to run with lance,<br>
 And him had he from the remotest reign<br>
 Of India ridden even into France:<br>
 After much thought, he to some friend would fain<br>
 Present him, rather than so, left to chance,<br>
 Abandon there the courser, as a prey,<br>
 To the first stranger who should pass that way.</td></tr>

 He stood upon the watch if he could view<br>
 Some hunter in the forest, or some hind,<br>
 To whom he might commit the charge, and who<br>
 Might to some city lead the horse behind.<br>

 Had dawned, when, while the twilight yet was blind,<br>
 He thought he saw, as he expecting stood,<br>
 A cavalier approaching through the wood.</td></tr>

 But it behoves that, ere the rest I say,<br>
 I Bradamant and good Rogero find.<br>
 After the horn had ceased, and, far away,<br>
 The beauteous pair had left the dome behind,<br>
 Rogero looked, and knew what till that day<br>
 He had seen not, by Atlantes rendered blind.<br>
 Atlantes had effected by his power,<br>
 They should not know each other till that hour.</td></tr>

 Rogero looks on Bradamant, and she<br>
 Looks on Rogero in profound surprise<br>

 Rejoiced, Rogero clasps his lady free,<br>
 Crimsoning with deeper than the rose’s dyes,<br>
 And his fair love’s first blossoms, while he clips<br>
 The gentle damsel, gathers from her lips.</td></tr>

 A thousand times they their embrace renew,<br>
 And closely each is by the other prest;<br>

 Their joys are ill contained within their breast.<br>
 Deluded by enchantments, much they rue<br>
 That while they were within the wizard’s rest,<br>
 They should not e’er have one another known,<br>
 And have so many happy days foregone.</td></tr>

 The gentle Bradamant, who was i’ the vein<br>
 To grant whatever prudent virgin might,<br>
 To solace her desiring lover’s pain,<br>
 So that her honour should receive no slight;<br>

 Nor find her ever stubborn, bade the knight,<br>
 Her of Duke Aymon through fair mean demand;<br>
 But be baptized before he claimed her hand.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXV.</td><td>
 Rogero good, who not alone to be<br>
 A Christian for the love of her were fain,<br>
 As his good sire had been, and anciently<br>
 His grandsire and his whole illustrious strain,<br>
 But for her pleasure would immediately<br>
 Resign whatever did of life remain,<br>
 Says, “I not only, if ’tis thy desire,<br>
 Will be baptized by water, but by fire.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XXXVI.</td><td>
 Then on his way to be baptized he hied,<br>
 That he might next espouse the martial may,<br>
 With Bradamant; who served him as a guide<br>
 To Vallombrosa’s fane, an abbey gray,<br>
 Rich, fair, nor less religious, and beside,<br>
 Courteous to whosoever passed that way;<br>
 And they encountered, issuing from the chase,<br>
 A woman, with a passing woful face.</td></tr>

 Rogero, as still courteous, still humane<br>
 To all, but woman most, when he discerned<br>
 Her dainty visage furrowed by a rain<br>
 Of lovely tears, sore pitied her, and burned<br>
 With the desire to know her grievous pain;<br>
 And having to the mournful lady turned,<br>
 Besought her, after fair salute, to show<br>
 What cause had made her eyes thus overflow.</td></tr>

 And she, uplifting their moist rays and bright,<br>
 Most kindly to the inquiring Child replied;<br>
 And of the cause of her unhappy plight,<br>
 Him, since he sought it, fully satisfied.<br>

 With the same lance with which he overbore<br>

 Well-covered with the shield which heretofore<br>
 Atlantes used on Pyrenean height;<br>

 For human sufferance, dazed the astonished sight:<br>
 To which Rogero, as a last resource,<br>
 In the most pressing peril had recourse.</td></tr>

 Was to that soberer region on his way!<br>

 By this astounded, ’mid the sea-foam lay;<br>
 Which would have fed upon the naked maid,<br>
 So cruel to the Child who brought her aid.</td></tr>

 Save these three times, he has preserved the shield<br>
 Beneath its veil, but covered in such wise<br>
 That it may quickly be to sight revealed,<br>
 If he in need of its good succour lies.<br>
 With this, as said before, he came a-field<br>
 As boldly, as if those three enemies,<br>
 Who were arrayed before him, had appeared<br>
 Yet less than little children to be feared.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">LXXXIV.</td><td>
 Rogero shocked the valiant Gryphon, where<br>
 The border of the buckler joined the sight,<br>
 Who seemed as he would fall, now here, now there,<br>
 And, from his courser far, last fell outright.<br>
 He at the shield had aimed, but smote not fair<br>
 The mark; and (for Rogero’s orb was bright<br>
 And smooth) the hissing weapon slipt, and wrought<br>
 Other effect than was in Gryphon’s thought.</td></tr>

 Tore off the rest, and made the buckler blaze:<br>

 Handled his sword, so good to thrust and smite;<br>
 And none descried his fury to oppose;<br>
 For in the charge dismounted were his foes.</td></tr>

 Of silk was handing down on the left side;<br>

 His shield, the evil cause of that mishap.</td></tr>

 He quickly turns, and, turning, rolls his eyes,<br>
 In hopes to view his well-loved martial maid;<br>
 And thitherward, without delay, he hies<br>
 Where, when the joust began, the damsel stayed.<br>
 Not finding her, it is the Child’s surmise<br>
 That she is gone to bear the stripling aid;<br>
 Fearing he may be burnt, while they their journey<br>
 So long delay, retarded by that tourney.</td></tr>

 He saw the damsel, stretched among the rest<br>
 Who him had thither guided: as she lay,<br>

 Before him, and, sore troubled, rode away.<br>

 She wore, concealed the enchanted buckler’s ray:<br>
 And to the maid restored, when ’twas concealed,<br>
 Her senses, which were ravished by the shield.</td></tr>

 Away Rogero posted with the dame,<br>
 And did not date his crimsoned visage raise;<br>
 Since every one, it seemed to him, might blame<br>
 With right that victory, worthy little praise.<br>

 (The blushing warrior said) the stain eraze?<br>
 For ’twill be bruited, all my deeds by sleight<br>
 Of magic have been done, and not by might.”</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XCI.</td><td>
 As, thinking thus, he journeyed on his way,<br>
 Rogero stumbled upon what he sought;<br>
 For, in the middle of the track, there lay<br>
 A well, within the ground profoundly wrought:<br>
 Whither the thirsty herd, at noon of day,<br>
 Repaired, their paunches with green forage fraught.<br>
 Rogero said, “ ’Tis now, must I provide,<br>
 I shame from thee, O shield, no more abide.</td></tr>

 “Thee will I keep no more, and this shall be<br>
 Even the last shame which so on me is thrown:”<br>
 The Child, so ending his self-colloquy,<br>
 Dismounting, takes a large and heavy stone;<br>
 Which to the shield he ties, and bodily<br>
 Both to the bottom of the well are gone.<br>
 “Lie buried there for ever, from all eyes,<br>
 And with thee hidden be my shame!” he cries.</td></tr>
 
 <tr><td align="right" valign="top">XCIII.</td><td>
 Filled to the brim with water was the well;<br>
 Heavy the stone, and heavy was the shield;<br>
 Nor stopt they till they to the bottom fell,<br>
 By the light, liquid element concealed.<br>
 Fame was not slow the noble act to swell,<br>
 But, wandering wide, the deed in brief revealed,<br>
 And voicing it abroad, with trumpet-sound,<br>
 Told France and Spain and all the countries round.</td></tr>

 When that so strange adventure to the rest<br>
 Of the wide world, from mouth to mouth was blown,<br>
 Knights out of number undertook the quest,<br>
 From neighbouring parts and distant; but unknown<br>
 To all remained the forest which possessed<br>
 The spring wherein the virtuous shield was thrown:<br>
