 On the left hand a castle richly dight<br>
 Stood nigh the gate, to which Sir Gryphon rode.<br>
 Besides, that it was strong and armed for fight,<br>
 Filled with rare chambers was the rich abode.<br>
 The first of Syria, king, and lord, and knight,<br>
 And lady, in a gentle group bestowed,<br>
 There in an open gallery fairly met,<br>
 Were at their glad and costly supper set.</td></tr>

 With the high tower the beauteous gallery, clear<br>
 Beyond the city-wall, projected out,<br>
 From whence might be discovered, far and near,<br>
 The spacious fields and different roads about.<br>
 When Gryphon now, in his opprobrious gear,<br>
 And arms, dishonoured by the rabble’s flout,<br>
 Makes, by ill fortune, to the gate resort,<br>
 He by the king is seen, and all his court;</td></tr>

 And, taken for the man whose crest he wears,<br>
 In dame and knight moves laughter, through the ring.<br>
 The vile Martano, as a man who shares<br>
 The royal grace, sits next below the king;<br>
 And next, she, whom her love so fitly pairs;<br>
 Whom Norandino gaily questioning.<br>
 Demands of them, who is the coward knight,<br>
 That of his honour makes so passing light;</td></tr>

 Who, after feat so base and foul, anew<br>
 Approaches, with such front and shameless cheer,<br>
 —And cries, “It seems a thing unheard, that you,<br>
 An excellent and worthy cavalier,<br>
 Should take this man for your companion, who<br>
 Has not in all our wide Levant his peer.<br>
 Did you with him for contrast-sake combine,<br>
 That so your valour might more brightly shine?</td></tr>

 By the eternal gods, I truly swear,<br>

 As I am wont to make his fellows share:<br>
 Him would I make of my long-nursed disdain<br>
 Of cowardice perpetual record bear.<br>
 To you, by whom he hither was conveyed,<br>
 If now unpunished, let his thanks be paid.”</td></tr>

 Journeying from Antioch hither, by the way:<br>
 But him I worthy of my company<br>
 Deemed, by his warlike semblance led astray.<br>

 And presence, I forbore by hand to rear,<br>
 Not for his sake:—nor by thy mercy showed<br>

 Hung as a beacon for the coward’s gaze.<br>

 A voucher he in Origilla had,<br>

 Enough that he again the people glad,<br>
 For penance of his weighty sin.” This said,<br>
 He quickly called a baron of his crew,<br>
 And him enjoined the deed he was to do.</td></tr>

 With many armed men that baron fares,<br>
 And to the city-gate descending, here<br>
 Collects his troop, and for the attempt prepares,<br>
 Waiting the coming of the cavalier;<br>
 And him surprises so at unawares,<br>
 He, softly, ’twixt two bridges, takes the peer;<br>
 And him detains, with mockery and scorn,<br>
 In a dark chamber, till returning morn.</td></tr>

 The early sun had scarce his golden hair<br>
 Uplifted from his ancient nurse’s breast,<br>
 Beginning, upon Alpine regions bare,<br>
 To chase the shades and gild the mountain-crest,<br>
 When Martan’, fearing Gryphon might declare<br>
 His wrong, and to the king the truth attest,<br>
 Retorting upon him the slander cast,<br>
 Took leave, and thence upon his journey past.</td></tr>

 His ready wit a fit excuse supplies<br>
 Why he stays not, to see the recreant shown.<br>

 Rewarded for the victory, not his own,<br>
 And letters patent, drawn in ample wise,<br>
 Wherein his lofty honours wide are blown.<br>
 Let him depart; I promise he shall meet<br>
 A guerdon worthy of his treacherous feat.</td></tr>

 Gryphon is brought with shame into the square,<br>
 When it is fully thronged with gazing wight,<br>
 Whom they of cuirass and of helmet bare,<br>
 And leave in simple cassock, meanly dight;<br>
 And, as to slaughter he conducted were,<br>
 Place on a wain, conspicuous to the sight;<br>
 Harnessed to which two sluggish cows are seen,<br>
 Weary and weak, and with long hunger lean.</td></tr>

 Thronging about the ignoble car, appear<br>
 Brazen-faced boy and girl of evil fame,<br>
 Who, each in turn, will play the charioteer,<br>
 And all assail the knight with bitter blame.<br>
 The boys might be a cause of greater fear,<br>
 For, joined to mocks and mows, and words of shame,<br>
 The warrior they with volleyed stones would slay,<br>
 But that the wiser few their fury stay.</td></tr>

 That which of his disgrace had been the ground,<br>
 Though no true evidence of guilt, his mail<br>

 Suspended at the shameful waggon’s tail.<br>

 Heralds, in front of a tribunal’s pale,<br>
 His shame, before his eyes, amid the crowd,<br>
 (Another’s evil deed) proclaim aloud.</td></tr>

 They take their prisoner thence, and so repair<br>
 In front of temple, dwelling-house, and store;<br>
 Nor any cruel name of mockery spare,<br>
 Nor leave unsaid a word of filthy lore;<br>
 And him at last without the city bear:<br>
 The foolish rabble, trusting evermore<br>
 Their thrall to banish to the sound of blows,<br>
 Who passing little of its prisoner knows.</td></tr>

 The warrior’s gyves no sooner they undo,<br>
 And from their manacles free either hand,<br>
 Than Gryphon seizes shield and sword, and, through<br>
 The rabble, makes long furrows with his brand.<br>
 With pike and spear unfurnished was the crew,<br>
 Who without weapons came, a witless band.<br>
 The rest for other canto I suspend,<br>
 For, sir, ’tis time this song should have an end.</td></tr>
