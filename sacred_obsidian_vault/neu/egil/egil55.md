 <center>CHAPTER LIV.<br>
 <br>
 <i>The fall of Thorolf.</i><br>
 <br>
 </center>King Athelstan had passed the night before in the town whereof mention was made above, and there he heard rumour that there had been fighting on the heath.  At once he and all the host made ready and marched northwards to the heath.  There they learnt all the tidings clearly, how that battle had gone.  Then the brothers Thorolf and Egil came to meet the king.  He thanked them much for their brave advance, and the victory they had won; he promised them his hearty friendship.  They all remained together for the night.<br>
 No sooner did day dawn than Athelstan waked up his army.  He held conference with his captains, and told them how his forces should be arranged.  His own division he first arranged, and in the van thereof he set those companies that were the smartest.<br>
 Then he said that Egil should command these: 'But Thorolf,' said he, 'shall be with his own men and such others as I add thereto.  This force shall be opposed to that part of the enemy which is loose and not in set array, for the Scots are ever loose in array; they run to and fro, and dash forward here and there.  Often they prove dangerous if men be not wary, but they are unsteady in the field if boldly faced.'<br>
 Egil answered the king: 'I will not that I and Thorolf be parted in the battle; rather to me it seems well that we two be placed there where is like to be most need and hardest fighting.'<br>
 Thorolf said, 'Leave we the king to rule where he will place us, serve we him as he likes best.  I will, if you wish it, change places with you.'<br>
 Egil said, 'Brother, you will have your way; but this separation I shall often rue.'<br>
 After this they formed in the divisions as the king had arranged, and the standards were raised.  The king's division stood on the plain towards the river; Thorolf's division moved on the higher ground beside the wood.  King Olaf drew up his forces when he saw king Athelstan had done so.  He also made two divisions; and his own standard, and the division that himself commanded, he opposed to king Athelstan and his division.  Either had a large army, there was no difference on the score of numbers.  But king Olaf's second division moved near the wood against the force under Thorolf.  The commanders thereof were Scotch earls, the men mostly Scots; and it was a great multitude.<br>
 And now the armies closed, and soon the battle waxed fierce.  Thorolf pressed eagerly forward, causing his standard to be borne onwards along the woodside; he thought to go so far forward as to turn upon the Scotch king's division behind their shields.  His own men held their shields before them; they trusted to the wood which was on their right to cover that side.  So far in advance went Thorolf that few of his men were before him.  But just when he was least on his guard, out leapt from the wood earl Adils and his followers.  They thrust at Thorolf at once with many halberds, and there by the wood he fell.  But Thorfid, who bore the standard, drew back to where the men stood thicker.  Adils now attacked them, and a fierce contest was there.  The Scots shouted a shout of victory, as having slain the enemy's chieftain.<br>
 This shout when Egil heard, and saw Thorolf's standard going back, he felt sure that Thorolf himself would not be with it.  So he bounded thither over the space between the two divisions.  Full soon learnt he the tidings of what was done, when he came to his men.  Then did he keenly spur them on to the charge, himself foremost in the van.  He had in his hand his sword Adder.  Forward Egil pressed, and hewed on either hand of him, felling many men.  Thorfid bore the standard close after him, behind the standard followed the rest.  Right sharp was the conflict there.  Egil went forward till he met earl Adils.  Few blows did they exchange ere earl Adils fell, and many men around him.  But after the earl's death his followers fled.  Egil and his force pursued, and slew all whom they overtook; no need there to beg quarter.  Nor stood those Scotch earls long, when they saw the others their fellows fly; but at once they took to their heels.<br>
 Whereupon Egil and his men made for where king Olaf's division was, and coming on them behind their shields soon wrought great havoc.  The division wavered, and broke up.  Many of king Olaf's men then fled, and the Norsemen shouted a shout of victory.<br>
 But when king Athelstan perceived king Olaf's division beginning to break, he then spurred on his force, and bade his standard advance.  A fierce onset was made, so that king Olaf's force recoiled, and there was a great slaughter.  King Olaf fell there, and the greater part of the force which he had had, for of those who turned to fly all who were overtaken were slain.  Thus king Athelstan gained a signal victory.<br>
