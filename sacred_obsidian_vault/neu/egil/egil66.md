 <center>CHAPTER LXV.<br>
 <br>
 <i>Egil goes to Norway.<br>
 <br>
 </i></center>There was a baron in Norway named Eric Allwise.  He married Thora, daughter of lord Thorir, sister of Arinbjorn.  He owned property eastwards in Vik.  He was a very wealthy man, much honoured, of prophetic foresight.  Son of Eric and Thora was Thorstein; he was brought up with Arinbjorn, and was now fully grown, though quite young.  He had gone westwards to England with Arinbjorn.<br>
 But in that same summer when Egil had come to England these tidings were heard from Norway, that Eric Allwise was dead, but the king's stewards had taken his inheritance, and claimed it for the king.  These tidings when Arinbjorn and Thorstein heard, they resolved that Thorstein should go east and see after the inheritance.<br>
 So when spring came on and men made ready their ships who meant to travel from land to land, then Thorstein went south to London, and there found king Athelstan.  He produced tokens and a message from Arinbjorn to the king and also to Egil, that he might be his advocate with the king, so that king Athelstan might send a message from himself to king Hacon, his foster-son, advising that Thorstein should get his inheritance and possessions in Norway.  King Athelstan was easily persuaded to this, because Arinbjorn was known to him for good.<br>
 Then came Egil also to speak with king Athelstan, and told him his intention.<br>
 'I wish this summer,' said he, 'to go eastwards to Norway and see after the property of which king Eric and Bergonund robbed me.  Atli the Short, Bergonund's brother, is now in possession.  I know that, if a message of yours be added, I shall get law in this matter.'<br>
 The king said that Egil should rule his own goings.  'But best, methinks, were it,' he said, 'for thee to be with me and be made defender of my land and command my army.  I will promote thee to great honour.'<br>
 Egil answered: 'This offer I deem most desirable to take.  I will say yea to it and not nay.  Yet have I first to go to Iceland, and see after my wife and the property that I have there.'<br>
 King Athelstan gave then to Egil a good merchant-ship and a cargo therewith; there was aboard for lading wheat and honey, and much money's worth in other wares.  And when Egil made ready his ship for sea, then Thorstein Eric's son settled to go with him, he of whom mention was made before, who was afterwards called Thora's son.  And when they were ready they sailed, king Athelstan and Egil parting with much friendship.<br>
 Egil and his company had a prosperous voyage; they came to Norway eastwards in Vik, and sailed their ship right into Osloar-firth.  Up on land there Thorstein had estates, and also inwards as far as Raumarik.  And when Thorstein landed there, he then preferred his claim to his father's property before the stewards who were settled on his farm.  Many lent help to Thorstein in this matter: a meeting was held about it: Thorstein had there many kinsmen of renown.  The end was that it was referred to the king's decision, Thorstein meanwhile taking to him the safe-keeping of his father's possessions.<br>
 For winter lodgment Egil went to Thorstein's with eleven more.  Thither to Thorstein's house was moved the wheat and honey; a merry time of it they had that winter.  Thorstein kept house in grand style, for provisions were in plenty.<br>
