 <center>CHAPTER XLII.<br>
 <br>
 <i>Thorolf asks Asgerdr to wife.</i><br>
 <br>
 </center>        Thorolf Skallagrim's son now sounded Thorir as to how he would take the matter should Thorolf ask in marriage Asgerdr his kinswoman.  Thorir welcomed this readily, saying that he would be his pleader in this suit.  Soon after Thorolf went north to Sogn with a goodly company.  He came to Bjorn's house, and was well received there.  Bjorn bade him be with him as long as he would.  Thorolf speedily opened to Bjorn his errand, and made his offer, asking Bjorn's daughter Asgerdr to wife.  This proposal Bjorn took well, his consent was easily won; and it was settled that the betrothal should be there, and a day was fixed for the wedding.  The feast was to be at Bjorn's in the autumn.<br>
         Then Thorolf went back to Thorir, and told him what had been done in his journey.  Thorir was glad that the match was to be made.  But when the time came that Thorolf should go to the feast, he bade men to go with him.  First bade he Thorir and Arinbjorn and their house-carles, and some rich yeoman; and for the journey there was a large and goodly company.<br>
         But when the appointed day was near at hand that Thorolf should leave home, and the bridesmen were now come, then Egil fell sick, so that he could not go.  Thorolf and his company had a large long-ship well equipt, and went on their way as had been agreed.<br>
