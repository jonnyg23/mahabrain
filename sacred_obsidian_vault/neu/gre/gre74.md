 <i></i><p align="CENTER">How Grettir took leave of his Mother at Biarg, and fared with Illugi his Brother to Drangey.</p>
 <p>GRETTIR rode north to Biarg a little after he parted with Thorod, and lay hid there yet awhile; then so great grew his fear in the dark, that he durst go nowhere as soon as dusk set in. His mother bade him abide there, but said withal, that she saw that it would scarce avail him aught, since he had so many cases against him throughout all the land. Grettir said that she should never have trouble brought on her for his sake.</p>
 <p>"But I shall no longer do so much for the keeping of my life," says he, "as to be alone."</p>
 <p>Now Illugi his brother was by that time about fifteen winters old, and the goodliest to look on of all men; and he overheard their talk together. Grettir was telling his mother what rede Gudmund the Rich had given him, and now that he should try, if he had a chance, to get out to Drangey, but he said withal, that he might not abide there, unless he might get some trusty man to be with him. Then said Illugi,</p>
 <p>"I will go with thee, brother, though I know not that I shall be of any help to thee, unless it be that I shall be ever true to thee, nor run from thee whiles thou standest up; and moreover I shall know more surely how thou farest if I am still in thy fellowship."</p>
 <p>Grettir answered, "Such a man thou art, that I am</p>
 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 205</font></a></p>
 <p>gladder in thee than in any other; and if it cross not my mother's mind, fain were I that thou shouldst fare with me."</p>
 <p>Then said Asdis, "Now can I see that it has come to this, that two troubles lie before us: for meseems I may ill spare Illugi, yet I know that so hard is thy lot, Grettir, that thou must in somewise find rede therefor; and howsoever it grieves me, O my sons, to see you both turn your backs on me, yet thus much will I do, if Grettir might thereby be somewhat more holpen than heretofore."</p>
 <p>Hereat was Illugi glad, for that he deemed it good to go with Grettir.</p>
 <p>So she gave them much of her chattels, and they made them ready for their journey. Asdis led them from out the garth, and before they parted she spake thus:</p>
 <p>"Ah, my sons twain, there ye depart from me, and one death ye shall have together; for no man may flee from that which is wrought for him: on no day now shall I see either of you once again; let one fate be over you both, then; for I know not what weal ye go to get for yourselves in Drangey, but there shall ye both lay your bones, and many will begrudge you that abiding place. Keep ye heedfully from wiles, yet none the less there shall ye be bitten of the edge of the sword, for marvellously have my dreams gone; be well ware of sorcery, for <i>little can cope with the cunning of eld</i>."</p>
 <p>And when she had thus spoken she wept right sore.</p>
 <p>Then said Grettir, "Weep not, mother, for if we be set on with weapons, it shalt be said of thee, that thou hast had sons, and not daughters: live on, well and hale."</p>
 <p>Therewithal they parted. They fared north through the country side and saw their kin; and thus they lingered out the autumn into winter; then they turned toward Skagafirth and went north through Waterpass and thence to Reekpass,</p>
 <p><a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 206</font></a></p>
 <p>and down Sæmunds-lithe and so unto Longholt, and came to Dinby late in the day.</p>
 <p>Grettir had cast his hood back on to his shoulders, for in that wise he went ever abroad whether the day were better or worse. So they went thence, and when they had gone but a little way, there met them a man, big-headed, tall, and gaunt, and ill clad; he greeted them, and either asked other for their names; they said who they were, but he called himself Thorbiorn; he was a land-louper, a man too lazy to work, and a great swaggerer, and much game and fooling was made with him by some folk: he thrust himself into their company, and told them much from the upper country about the folk there. Grettir had great game and merriment of him; so he asked if they had no need of a man who should work for them, "for I would fain fare with you," says he; and withal he got so much from their talk that they suffered him to follow them.</p>
 <p>Much snow there was that day, and it was cold; but whereas that man swaggered exceedingly, and was the greatest of tomfools, he had a by-name, and was called Noise.</p>
 <p>"Great wonder had those of Dinby when thou wentest by e'en now unhooded, in a foul weather," said Noise, "as to whether thou wouldst have as little fear of men as of the cold: there were two bonders' sons, both men of great strength, and the shepherd called them forth to go to the sheep-watching with him, and scarcely could they clothe themselves for the cold."</p>
 <p>Grettir said, "I saw within doors there a young man who pulled on his mittens, and another going betwixt byre and midden, and of neither of them should I be afeared."</p>
 <p>Thereafter they went down to Sorbness, and were there through the night; then they fared out along the strand to a</p>
 <p><a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 207</font></a></p>
 <p>farm called Reeks, where dwelt a man, Thorvald by name, a good bonder. Him Grettir prayed for watch and ward, and told him how he was minded to get out to Drangey: the bonder said that those of Skagafirth would think him no god-send, and excused himself therewithal.</p>
 <p>Then Grettir took a purse his mother had given to him, and gave it to the bonder; his brows lightened over the money, and he got three house-carles of his to bring them out in the night time by the light of the moon. It is but a little way from Reeks out to the island, one sea-mile only. So when they came to the isle, Grettir deemed it good to behold, because it was grass-grown, and rose up sheer from the sea, so that no man might come up thereon save there where the ladders were let down, and if the uppermost ladder were drawn up, it was no man's deed to get upon the island. There also were the cliffs full of fowl in the summer-tide, and there were eighty sheep upon the island which the bonders owned, and they were mostly rams and ewes which they had mind to slaughter.</p>
 <p>There Grettir set himself down in peace; and by then had he been fifteen or sixteen winters in outlawry, as Sturla Thordson has said.</p>
