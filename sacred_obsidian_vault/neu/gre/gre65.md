 <i></i><p align="CENTER">Of the Fight at Hitriver.</p>
 <p>WHEN Grettir had been two winters at Fairwoodfell, and the third was now come, he fared south to the Marshes, to the farm called Brook-bow, and had thence six wethers against the will of him who owned them, Then he went to Acres and took away two neat for slaughtering, and many sheep, and then went up south of Hitriver.</p>
 <p>But when the bonders were ware of his ways, they sent word to Thord at Hitness, and bade him take in hand the slaying of Grettir; but he hung back, yet for the prayers of men got his son Arnor, who was afterwards called Earls'-Skald,</p>
 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 179</font></a></p>
 <p>to go with them, and bade them withal to take heed that Grettir escaped not.</p>
 <p>Then were men sent throughout all the country-side. There was a man called Biarni, who dwelt at Jorvi in Flysiawharf, and he gathered men together from without Hitriver; and their purpose was that a band should be on either bank of the river.</p>
 <p>Now Grettir had two men with him; a man called Eyolf, the son of the bonder at Fairwood, and a stout man; and another he had besides.</p>
 <p>First came up Thorarin of Acres and Thorfinn of Brookbow, and there were nigh twenty men in their company. Then was Grettir fain to make westward across the river, but therewith came up on the west side thereof Arnor and Biarni. A narrow ness ran into the water on the side whereas Grettir stood; so he drave the beasts into the-furthermost parts of the ness, when he saw the men coming up, for never would he give up what he had once laid his hands on.</p>
 <p>Now the Marsh-men straightway made ready for an onslaught, and made themselves very big; Grettir bade his fellows take heed that none came at his back; and not many men could come on at once.</p>
 <p>Now a hard fight there was betwixt them, Grettir smote with the short-sword with both hands, and no easy matter it was to get at him; some of the Marsh-men fell, and some were wounded; those on the other side of the river were slow in coming up, because the ford was not very near, nor did the fight go on long before they fell off; Thorarin of Acres was a very old man, so that he was not at this onslaught. But when this fight was over, then came up Thrand, son of Thorarin, and Thorgils Ingialdson, the brother's son of Thorarin, and Finnbogi, son of Thorgeir Thorhaddsen of Hitdale, and Steinulf Thorleifson from Lavadale; these</p>

 <p>egged on their men eagerly to set on, and yet another fierce onslaught they made. Now Grettir saw that he must either flee or spare himself nought; and now he went forth so fiercely that none might withstand him; because they were so many that he saw not how he might escape, but that he did his best before he fell; he was fain withal that the life of such an one as he deemed of some worth might be paid for his life; so he ran at Steinulf of Lavadale, and smote him on the head and clave him down to the shoulders, and straightway with another blow smote Thorgils Ingialdson in the midst and well-nigh cut him asunder; then would Thrand run forth to revenge his kinsman, but Grettir smote him on the right thigh, so that the blow took off all the muscle, and straightway was he unmeet for fight; and thereafter withal a great wound Grettir gave to Finnbogi.</p>
 <p>Then Thorarin cried out and bade them fall back, "For the longer ye fight the worse ye will get of him, and he picks out men even as he willeth from your company."</p>
 <p>So did they, and turned away; and there had ten men fallen, and five were wounded to death, or crippled, but most of those who had been at that meeting had some hurt or other; Grettir was marvellously wearied and yet but a little wounded.</p>
 <p>And now the Marsh-men made off with great loss of men, for many stout fellows had fallen there.</p>
 <p>But those on the other side of the river fared slowly, and came not up till the meeting was all done; and when they saw how ill their men had fared, then Arnor would not risk himself, and much rebuke he got therefor from his father and many others; and men are minded to think that he was no man of prowess.</p>
 <p>Now that place where they fought is called Grettir's point to-day.</p>
