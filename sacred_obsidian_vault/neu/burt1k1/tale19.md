 <center><h1>            THE SECOND VOYAGE OF SINDBAD THE SEAMAN
 </h1></center><p>  KNOW, O my brother, that I was living a most comfortable and
 enjoyable life, in all solace and delight, as I told you yesterday,
 until one day my mind became possessed with the thought of traveling
 about the world of men and seeing their cities and islands, and a
 longing seized me to traffic and to make money by trade. Upon this
 resolve I took a great store of cash and buying goods and gear fit for
 travel, bound them up in bales. Then I went down to the riverbank,
 where I found a noble ship and brand-new about to sail equipped with
 sails of fine cloth and well manned and provided. So I took passage in
 her, with a number of other merchants, and after embarking our
 goods, we weighed anchor the same day. Right fair was our voyage,
 and we sailed from place to place and from isle to isle, and
 whenever we anchored we met a crowd of merchants and notables and
 customers, and we took to buying and selling and bartering.
 </p><p>  At last Destiny brought us to an island, fair and verdant, in
 trees abundant, with yellow-ripe fruits luxuriant, and flowers
 fragrant and birds warbling soft descant, and streams crystalline
 and radiant. But no sign of man showed to the descrier- no, not a
 blower of the fire. The captain made fast with us to this island,
 and the merchants and sailors landed and walked about, enjoying the
 shade of the trees and the song of the birds, that chanted the praises
 of the One, the Victorious, and marveling at the works of the
 Omnipotent King. I landed with the rest, and, sitting down by a spring
 of sweet water that welled up among the trees, took out some vivers
 I had with me and ate of that which Allah Almighty had allotted unto
 me. And so sweet was the zephyr and so fragrant were the flowers
 that presently I waxed drowsy and, lying down in that place, was
 soon drowned in sleep.
 </p><p>  When I awoke, I found myself alone, for the ship had sailed and left
 me behind, nor had one of the merchants or sailors bethought himself
 of me. I searched the island right and left, but found neither man nor
 Jinn, whereat I was beyond measure troubled, and my gall was like to
 burst for stress of chagrin and anguish and concern, because I was
 left quite alone, without aught of worldly gear or meat or drink,
 weary and heartbroken. So I gave myself up for lost and said: "Not
 always doth the crock escape the shock. I was saved the first time
 by finding one who brought me from the desert island to an inhabited
 place, but now there is no hope for me." Then I fell to weeping and
 wailing and gave myself up to an access of rage, blaming myself for
 having again ventured upon the perils and hardships of voyage,
 whenas I was at my ease in mine own house in mine own land, taking
 my pleasure with good meat and good drink and good clothes and lacking
 nothing, neither money nor goods. And I repented me of having left
 Baghdad, and this the more after all the travails and dangers I had
 undergone in my first voyage, wherein I had so narrowly escaped
 destruction, and exclaimed, "Verily we are, Allah's, and unto Him we
 are returning!"
 </p><p>  I was indeed even as one mad and Jinn-struck, and presently I rose
 and walked about the island, right and left and every whither,
 unable for trouble to sit or tarry in ay one place. Then I climbed a
 tall tree and looked in all directions, but saw nothing save sky and
 sea and trees and birds and isles and sands. However, after a while my
 eager glances fell upon some great white thing, afar off in the
 interior of the island. So I came down from the tree and made for that
 which I had seen, and behold, it was a huge white dome rising high
 in air and of vast compass. I walked all around it, but found no
 door thereto, nor could I muster strength or nimbleness by reason of
 its exceeding smoothness and slipperiness. So I marked the spot
 where I stood and went round about the dome to measure its
 circumference, which I found fifty good paces. And as I stood
 casting about how to gain an entrance, the day being near its fall and
 the sun being near the horizon, behold, the sun was suddenly hidden
 from me and the air became dull and dar! Methought a cloud had come
 over the sun, but it was the season of summer, so I marveled at this
 and, lifting my head, looked steadfastly at the sky, when I saw that
 the cloud was none other than an enormous bird, of gigantic girth
 and inordinately wide of wing, which as it flew through the air veiled
 the sun and hid it from the island.
 </p><p>  At this sight my wonder redoubled and I remembered a story I had
 heard aforetime of pilgrims and travelers, how in a certain island
 dwelleth a huge bird, called the "roc," which feedeth its young on
 elephants, and I was certified that the dome which caught my sight was
 none other than a roc's egg. As I looked and wondered at the marvelous
 works of the Almighty, the bird alighted on the dome and brooded
 over it with its wings covering it and its legs stretched out behind
 it on the ground, and in this posture it fell asleep, glory be to
 Him who sleepeth not! When I saw this, I arose and, unwinding my
 turban from my head, doubled it and twisted it into a rope, with which
 I girt my middle and bound my waist fast to the legs of the roc,
 saying in myself, "Peradventure this bird may carry me to a land of
 cities and inhabitants, and that will be better than abiding in this
 desert island." I passed the night watching and fearing to sleep, lest
 the bird should fly away with me unawares, and as soon as the dawn
 broke and morn shone, the roc rose off its egg and spreading its wings
 with a great cry, flew up into the air dragging me with it, nor ceased
 it to soar and to tower till I thought it had reached the limit of the
 firmament. After which it descended earthward, little by little,
 till it lighted on the top of a high hill.
 </p><p>  As soon as I found myself on the hard ground, I made haste to unbind
 myself, quaking for fear of the bird, though it took no heed of me nor
 even felt me, and loosing my turban from its feet, I made off with
 my best speed. Presently I saw it catch up in its huge claws something
 from the earth and rise with it high in air, and observing it
 narrowly, I saw it to be a serpent big of bulk and gigantic of
 girth, wherewith it flew away clean out of sight. I marveled at this,
 and faring forward, found myself on a peak overlooking a valley,
 exceeding great and wide and deep and bounded by vast mountains that
 spired high in air. None could descry their summits for the excess
 of their height, nor was any able to climb up thereto. When I saw
 this, I blamed myself for that which I had done and said: "Would
 Heaven I had tarried in the island! It was better than this wild
 desert, for there I had at least fruits to eat and water to drink, and
 here are neither trees nor fruits nor streams. But there is no Majesty
 and there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!
 Verily, as often as I am quit of one peril I fall into a worse
 danger and a more grievous."
 </p><p>  However, I took courage and walking along the wady, found that its
 soil was of diamond, the stone wherewith they pierce minerals and
 precious stones and porcelain and onyx, for that it is a dense stone
 and a dure, whereon neither iron nor hardhed hath effect, neither
 can we cut off aught therefrom nor break it, save by means of
 loadstone. Moreover, the valley swarmed with snakes and vipers, each
 big as a palm tree, that would have made but one gulp of an
 elephant. And they came out by night, hiding during the day lest the
 rocs and eagles pounce on them and tear them to pieces, as was their
 wont, why I wot not. And I repented of what I had done and Allah, I
 have made haste to bring destruction upon myself!" The day began to
 wane as I went along, and I looked about for a place where I might
 pass the night, being in fear of the serpents, ace for my and I took
 no thought of meat and drink in my concern for my life. Presently, I
 caught sight of a cave near-hand, with a narrow doorway, so I entered,
 and seeing a great stone close to the mouth, I rolled it up and
 stopped the entrance, saying to myself, "I am safe here for the night,
 and as soon as it is day, I will go forth and see what Destiny will
 do." Then I looked within the cave and saw at the upper end a great
 serpent brooding on her eggs, at which my flesh quaked and my hair
 stood on end, but I raised my eyes to Heaven and, committing my case
 to fate and lot, abode all that night without sleep till daybreak,
 when I rolled back the stone from the mouth of the cave and went
 forth, staggering like a drunken man and giddy with watching and
 fear and hunger.
 </p><p>  As in this sore case I walked along the valley, behold, there fell
 down before me a slaughtered beast. But I saw no one, whereat I
 marveled with great marvel and presently remembered a story I had
 heard aforetime of traders and pilgrims and travelers- how the
 mountains where are the diamonds are full of perils and terrors, nor
 can any fare through them, but the merchants who traffic in diamonds
 have a device by which they obtain them; that is to say, they take a
 sheep and slaughter and skin it and cut it in pieces and cast them
 down from the mountaintops into the valley sole, where, the meat being
 fresh and sticky with blood, some of the gems cleave to it. Then
 they leave it till midday, when the eagles and vultures swoop down
 upon it and carry it in their claws to the mountain summits, whereupon
 the merchants come and shout at them and scare them away from the
 meat. Then they come, and taking the diamonds which they find sticking
 to it, go their ways with them and leave the meat to the birds and
 beasts, nor can any come at the diamonds but by this device.
 </p><p>  So when I saw the slaughtered beast fall (he pursued) and
 bethought me of the story, I went up to it and filled my pockets and
 shawl girdle and turban and the folds of my clothes with the
 choicest diamonds, and as I was thus engaged, down fell before me
 another great piece of meat. Then with my unrolled turban and lying on
 my back, I set the bit on my breast so that I was hidden by the
 meat, which was thus raised above the ground. Hardly had I gripped
 it when an eagle swooped down upon the flesh and, seizing it with
 his talons, flew up with it high in air and me clinging thereto, and
 ceased not its flight till it alighted on the head of one of the
 mountains, where, dropping the carcass he fell to rending it. But,
 behold, there arose behind him a great noise of shouting and
 clattering of wood, whereat the bird took fright and flew away. Then I
 loosed off myself the meat, with clothes daubed with blood
 therefrom, and stood up by its side. Whereupon up came the merchant
 who had cried out at the eagle, and seeing me standing there,
 bespoke me not, but was affrighted at me and shook with fear.
 </p><p>  However, he went up to the carcass and, turning it over, found no
 diamonds sticking to it, whereat he gave a great cry and exclaimed:
 "Harrow, my disappointment! There is no Majesty and there is no
 Might save in Allah with Whom we seek refuge from Satan the stoned!"
 And he bemoaned himself and beat hand upon hand, saying: "Alas, the
 pity of it! How cometh this?" Then I went up-to him and he said to me,
 "Who art thou, and what causeth thee to come hither?" And I: "Fear
 not, I am a man and a good man and a merchant. My story is a
 wondrous and my adventures marvelous and the manner of my coming
 hither is prodigious. So be of good cheer. Thou shalt receive of me
 what shall rejoice thee, for I have with me great plenty of diamonds
 and I will give thee thereof what shall suffice thee, for each is
 better than aught thou couldst get otherwise. So fear nothing." The
 man rejoiced thereat and thanked and blessed me. Then we talked
 together till the other merchants, hearing me in discourse with
 their fellow, came up and saluted me, for each of them had thrown down
 his piece of meat.
 </p><p>  And as I went off with them and told them my whole story, how I
 had suffered hardships at sea and the fashion of my reaching the
 valley. But I gave the owner of the meat a number of the stones I
 had by me, so they all wished me joy of my escape, saying: "By
 Allah, a new life hath been decreed to thee, for none ever reached
 yonder valley and came off thence alive before thee, but praised be
 Allah for thy safety!" We passed the night together in a safe and
 pleasant place, beyond measure rejoiced at my deliverance from the
 valley of Serpents and my arrival in an inhabited land. And on the
 morrow we set out and journeyed over the mighty range of mountains,
 seeing many serpents in the valley, till we came to a fair great
 island wherein was a garden of huge champhor trees under each of which
 a hundred men might take shelter. When the folk have a mind to get
 camphor, they bore into the upper part of the bole with a long iron,
 whereupon the liquid camphor, which is the sap of the tree, floweth
 out and they catch it in vessels, where it concreteth like gum; but
 after this the tree dieth and becometh firewood.
 </p><p>  Moreover, there is in this island a kind of wild beast, called
 rhinoceros, that pastureth as do steers and buffaloes with us; but
 it is a huge brute, bigger of body than the camel, and like it feedeth
 upon the leaves and twigs of trees. It is a remarkable animal with a
 great and thick horn, ten cubits long, a-middleward its head,
 wherein, when cleft in twain, is the likeness of a man. Voyagers and
 pilgrims and travelers declare that this beast called karkadan will
 carry off a great elephant on its horn and graze about the island
 and the seacoast therewith and take no heed of it till the elephant
 dieth and its fat, melting in the sun, runneth down into the
 rhinoceros's eyes and blindeth him, so that he lieth down on the
 shore. Then comes the bird roc and carrieth off both the rhinoceros
 and that which is on its horn, to feed its young withal. Moreover, I
 saw in this island many kinds of oxen and buffaloes, whose like are
 not found in our country.
 </p><p>  Here I sold some of the diamonds which I had by me for gold dinars
 and silver dirhams and bartered others for the produce of the country,
 and loading them upon beasts of burden, fared on with the merchants
 from valley to valley and town to town, buying and selling and viewing
 foreign countries and the works and creatures of Allah till we came to
 Bassorah city, where we abode a few days, after which I continued my
 journey to Baghdad. I arrived at home with great store of diamonds and
 money and goods, and forgathered with my friends and relations and
 gave alms and largess and bestowed curious gifts and made presents
 to all my friends and companions. Then I betook myself to eating
 well and drinking well and wearing fine clothes and making merry
 with my fellows, and forgot all my sufferings in the pleasures of
 return to the solace and delight of life, with light heart and
 broadened breast. And everyone who heard of my return came and
 questioned me of my adventures and of foreign countries, and I related
 to them all that had befallen me, and the much I had suffered, whereat
 they wondered and gave me joy of my safe return.
 </p><p>  This, then, is the end of the story of my second voyage, and
 tomorrow, Inshallah! I will tell you what befell me in my third
 voyage.
 The company marveled at his story and supped with him, after which
 he ordered a hundred dinars of gold to be given to the porter, who
 took the sum with many thanks and blessings (which he stinted not even
 when he reached home) and went his way, wondering at what he had
 heard. Next morning as soon as day came in its sheen and shone, he
 rose and, praying the dawn prayer, repaired to the house of Sindbad
 the Seaman, even as he had bidden him, and went in and gave him good
 morrow. The merchant welcomed him and made him sit with him till the
 rest of the company arrived, and when they had well eaten and
 drunken and were merry with joy and jollity, their host began by
 saying: Hearken, O my brothers, to what I am about to tell you, for it
 is even more wondrous than what you have already heard. But Allah
 alone kenneth what things His Omniscience concealed from man! And
