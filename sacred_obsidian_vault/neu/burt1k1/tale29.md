 <center><h1>            STORY OF THE LARRIKIN AND THE COOK
 </h1></center><p>  ONE of the ne'er do-wells found himself one fine morning without
 aught, and the world was straitened upon him and patience failed
 him. So he lay down to sleep, and ceased not slumbering till the sun
 stang him and the foam came out upon his mouth, whereupon he arose,
 and he was penniless and had not even so much as a single dirham.
 Presently he arrived at the shop of a cook, who had set his pots and
 pans over the fire and washed his saucers and wiped his scales and
 swept his shop and sprinkled it. And indeed his fats and oils were
 clear and clarified and his spices fragrant, and he himself stood
 behind his cooking pots ready to serve customers. So the larrikin,
 whose wits had been sharpened by hunger, went in to him and saluting
 him, said to him, "Weigh me half a dirham's worth of meat and a
 quarter of a dirham's worth of boiled grain, and the like of bread."
 So the kitchener weighed it out to him and the good-for-naught entered
 the shop, whereupon the man set the food before him and he ate till he
 had gobbled up the whole and licked the saucers and sat perplexed,
 knowing not how he should do with the cook concerning the price of
 that he had eaten, and turning his eyes about upon everything in the
 shop.
 </p><p>  And as he looked, behold, he caught sight of an earthen pan lying
 arsy-versy upon its mouth, so he raised it from the ground and found
 under it a horse's tail, freshly cut off and the blood oozing from it,
 whereby he knew that the cook adulterated his meat with horseflesh.
 When he discovered this default, he rejoiced therein, and washing
 his hands, bowed his head and went out. And when the kitchener saw
 that he went and gave him naught, he cried out, saying, "Stay, O pest,
 O burglar!" So the larrikin stopped and said to him, "Dost thou cry
 out upon me and call to me with these words, O comute?" Whereat the
 cook was angry, and coming down from the shop, cried: "What meanest
 thou by thy speech, O low fellow, thou that devourest meat and
 millet and bread and kitchen and goest forth with 'the peace be on
 thee!' as it were the thing had not been and down naught for it?"
 Quoth the lackpenny, "Thou liest, O accursed son of a cuckold!"
 Whereupon the cook cried out, and laying hold of his debtor's
 collar, said, "O Moslems, this fellow is my first customer this day,
 and he hath eaten my food and given me naught."
 </p><p>  So the folk gathered about them and blamed the ne'er-do-well and
 said to him, "Give him the price of that which thou hast eaten." Quoth
 he, "I gave him a dirham before I entered the shop," and quoth the
 cook: "Be everything I sell this day forbidden to me, if he gave me so
 much as the name of a coin! By Allah, he gave me naught, but ate my
 food and went out and would have made off, without aught said."
 Answered the larrikin, "I gave thee a dirham," and he reviled the
 kitchener, who returned his abuse, whereupon he dealt him a buffet and
 they gripped and grappled and throttled each other. When the folk
 saw them fighting, they came up to them and asked them, "What is
 this strife between you, and no cause for it?" and the lackpenny
 answered, "Ay, by Allah, but there is a cause for it, and the cause
 hath a tail!" Whereupon cried the cook: "Yea, by Allah, now thou
 mindest me of thyself and thy dirham! Yes, he gave me a dirham, and
 but a quarter of the coin is spent. Come back and take the rest of the
 price of thy dirham." For he understood what was to do, at the mention
 of the tail.
 </p><p>  "And I, O my brother," added Abu al-Hasan, "my story hath a cause,
 which I will tell thee." The Caliph laughed at his speech and said:
 "By Allah, this is none other than a pleasant tale! Tell me thy
 story and the cause."
 </p><p>  Replied the host: "With love and goodly gree! Know, O my lord,
 that my name is Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a and that my father died and
 left me abundant wealth, of which I made two parts. One I laid up, and
 with the other I betook myself to enjoying the pleasures of friendship
 and conviviality and consorting with intimates and boon companions and
 the sons of the merchants, nor did I leave one but I caroused with him
 and he with me. And I lavished all my money on comrades and good
 cheer, till there remained with me naught. Whereupon I betook myself
 to the friends and fellow topers upon whom I wasted my wealth, so
 perhaps they might provide for my case, but when I visited them and
 went round about to them all, I found no vantage in one of them, nor
 would any so much as break a bittock of bread in my face. So I wept
 for myself, and repairing to my mother, complained to her of my
 case. Quoth she: 'Such are friends. An thou have aught, they
 frequent thee and devour thee, but an thou have naught, they cast thee
 off and chase thee away.' Then I brought out the other half of my
 money and bound myself by an oath that I would never more entertain
 any save one single night, after which I would never again salute
 him nor notice him. Hence my saying to thee: 'Far be it, alas! that
 what is past should again come to pass, for I will never again company
 with thee after this night."'
 </p><p>  When the Commander of the Faithful heard this, he laughed a loud
 laugh and said: "By Allah, O my brother, thou art indeed excused in
 this matter, now that I know the cause and that the cause hath a tail.
 Nevertheless, Inshallah, I will not sever myself from thee." Replied
 Abu al-Hasan: "O my guest, did I not say to thee, 'Far be it, alas!
 that what is past should again come to pass?' For indeed I will
 never again forgather with any!" Then the Caliph rose and the host set
 before him a dish of roast goose and a bannock of first bread, and
 sitting down, fell to cutting off morsels and morseling the Caliph
 therewith. They gave not over eating till they were filled, when Abu
 al-Hasan brought basin and ewer and potash and they washed their
 hands. Then he lighted three wax candles and three lamps, and
 spreading the drinking cloth, brought strained wine, clear, old, and
 fragrant, whose scent was as that of virgin musk. He filled the
 first cup and saying, "O my boon companion, be ceremony laid aside
 between us by thy leave! Thy slave is by thee, may I not be
 afflicted with thy loss!" drank if off and filled a second cup,
 which he handed to the Caliph with due reverence.
 </p><p>  His fashion pleased the Commander of the Faithful, and the
 goodliness of his speech, and he said to himself, "By Allah, I will
 assuredly requite him for this!" Then Abu al-Hasan filled the cup
 again and handed it to the Cahph, reciting these two couplets:
 </p><p>  "Had we thy coming known, we would for sacrifice
 <br>  Have poured thee out heart's blood or blackness of the eyes.
 <br>  Ay, and we would have spread our bosoms in thy way,
 <br>  That so thy feet might fare on eyelids, carpet-wise."
 <br></p><p>When the Caliph heard his verses, he took the cup from his hand and
 kissed it and drank it off and returned it to Abu al-Hasan, who made
 him an obeisance and filled and drank. Then he filled again, and
 kissing the cup thrice, recited these lines:
 </p><p>      "Your presence honoreth the base,
 <br>      And we confess the deed of grace.
 <br>      An you absent yourself from us,
 <br>      No freke we find to fill your place."
 <br></p><p>  Then he gave the cup to the Caliph, saying: "Drink it in health
 and soundness! It doeth away malady and bringeth remedy and setteth
 the runnels of health to flow free." So they ceased not carousing
 and conversing till middle night, when the Caliph said to his host, "O
 my brother, hast thou in thy heart a concupiscence thou wouldst have
 accomplished, or a contingency thou wouldst avert?" Said he: "By
 Allah, there is no regret in my heart save that I am not empowered
 with bidding and forbidding, so I might manage what is in my mind!"
 Quoth the Commander of the Faithful, "By Allah, and again by Allah,
 O my brother, tell me what is in thy mind!" And quoth Abu al-Hasan:
 "Would Heaven I might be Caliph for one day and avenge myself on my
 neighbors, for that in my vicinity is a mosque, and therein four
 sheikhs, who hold it a grievance when there cometh a guest to me,
 and they trouble me with talk and worry me in words and menace me that
 they will complain of me to the Prince of True Believers, and indeed
 they oppress me exceedingly. And I crave of Allah the Most High
 power for one day, that I may beat each and every of them with four
 hundred lashes, as well as the imam of the mosque, and parade them
 round about the city of Baghdad and bid cry before them: 'This is
 the reward and the least of the reward of whoso exceedeth in talk
 and vexeth the folk and turneth their joy to annoy.' This is what I
 wish, and no more."
 </p><p>  Said the Caliph: "Allah grant thee that thou seekest! Let us crack
 one last cup and rise ere the dawn draw near, and, tomorrow night I
 will be with thee again." Said Abu al-Hasan, "Far be it!" Then the
 Caliph crowned a cup, and putting therein a piece of Cretan bhang,
 gave it to his host and said to him, "My life on thee, O my brother,
 drink this cup from my hand!" and Abu al-Hasan answered, "Ay, by thy
 life, I will drink it from thy hand." So he took it and drank it
 off, but hardly had it settled in his stomach when his head forewent
 his heels and he fell to the ground like one slain. Whereupon the
 Caliph went out and said to his slave Masrur: "Go in to yonder young
 man, the housemaster, and take him up and bring him to me at the
 palace. And when thou goest out, shut the door." So saying, he went
 away, whilst Masrur entered, and taking up Abu al-Hasan, shut the door
 behind him, and made after his master till he reached with him the
 palace what while the night drew to an end and the cocks began
 crowing, and set him down before the Commander of the Faithful, who
 laughed at him.
 </p><p>  Then he sent for Ja'afar the Barmecide and when he came before
 him, said to him, "Note thou yonder young man," pointing to Abu
 al-Hasan, "and when thou shalt see him tomorrow seated in my place
 of estate and on the throne of my caliphate and clad in my royal
 clothing, stand thou in attendance upon him, and enjoin the emirs
 and grandees and the folk of my household and the officers of my realm
 to be upon their feet, as in his service, and obey him in whatso he
 shall bid them do. And thou, if he speak to thee of aught, do it,
 and hearken unto his say and gainsay him not in anything during this
 coming day." Ja'afar acknowledged the order with "Hearkening and
 obedience" and withdrew, whilst the Prince of True Believers went in
 to the palace women, who came up to him, and he said to them: "When
 this sleeper shall awake tomorrow, kiss ye the ground between his
 hands, and do ye wait upon him and gather round about him and clothe
 him in the royal clothing and serve him with the service of the
 caliphate, and deny not aught of his estate, but say to him, 'Thou art
 the Caliph."' Then he taught them what they should say to him and
 how they should do with him, and withdrawing to a retired room, let
 down a curtain before himself and slept.
 </p><p>  Thus fared it with the Caliph, but as regards Abu al-Hasan, he
 gave not over snoring in his sleep till the day brake clear and the
 rising of the sun drew near, when a woman in waiting came up to him
 and said to him, "O our lord, the morning prayer!" Hearing these
 words, he laughed, and opening his eyes, turned them about the
 palace and found himself in an apartment whose walls were Painted with
 gold and lapis lazuli and its ceiling dotted and starred with red
 gold. Around it were sleeping chambers with curtains of
 gold-embroidered silk let down over their doors, and all about vessels
 of gold and porcelain and crystal and furniture and carpets dispread
 and lamps burning before the niche wherein men prayed, and slave girls
 and eunuchs and Mamelukes and black slaves and boys and pages and
 attendants.
 </p><p>  When he saw this, he was bewildered in his wit and said: "By Allah
 either I am dreaming a dream, or this is Paradise and the Abode of
 Peace!" And he shut his eyes and would have slept again. Quoth one
 of the eunuchs, "O my lord, this is not of thy wont, O Commander of
 the Faithful!" Then the rest of the handmaids of the palace came up to
 him and lifted him into a sitting posture, when he found himself
 upon a mattress raised a cubit's height from the ground and all
 stuffed with floss silk. So they seated him upon it and propped his
 elbow with a pillow, and he looked at the apartment and its vastness
 and saw those eunuchs and slave girls in attendance upon him and
 standing about his head, whereupon he laughed at himself and said, "By
 Allah, 'tis not as I were on wake, yet I am not asleep!" And in his
 perplexity he bowed his chin upon his bosom, and then opened his eyes,
 little by little, smiling, and saying, "What is this state wherein I
 find myself?" Then he arose and sat up, whilst the damsels laughed
 at him privily, and he was bewildered in his wit, and bit his
 finger, and as the bite pained him, he cried "Oh!" and was vexed.
 And the Caliph watched him whence he saw him not, and laughed.
 </p><p>  Presently Abu al-Hasan turned to a damsel and called to her,
 whereupon she answered, "At thy service, O Prince of True
 Believers!" Quoth he, "What is thy name?" and quoth she, "Shajarat
 al-Durr." Then he said to her, "By the protection of Allah, O
 damsel, am I Commander of the Faithful?" She replied, "Yes, indeed, by
 the protection of Allah thou in this time art Commander of the
 Faithful." Quoth he, "By Allah, thou liest, O thousandfold whore!"
 Then he glanced at the chief eunuch and called to him, whereupon he
 came to him and kissing the ground before him, said, "Yes, O Commander
 of the Faithful." Asked Abu al-Hasan, "Who is Commander of the
 Faithful?" and the eunuch answered "Thou." And Abu al-Hasan said,
 "Thou Hest, thousandfold he-whore that thou art!" Then he turned to
 another eunuch and said to him, "O my chief, by the protection of
 Allah, am I Prince of the True Believers?" Said he: "Ay, by Allah, O
 my lord, thou art in this time Commander of the Faithful and
 Viceregent of the Lord of the Three Worlds."
 </p><p>  Abu al-Hasan laughed at himself and doubted of his reason and was
 bewildered at what he beheld, and said: "In one night do I become
 Caliph? Yesterday I was Abu al-Hasan the Wag, and today I am Commander
 of the Faithful." Then the Chief Eunuch came up to him and said: "O
 Prince of True Believers (the name of Allah encompass thee!), thou art
 indeed Commander of the Faithful and Viceregent of the Lord of the
 Three Worlds!" And the slave girls and eunuchs flocked round about
 him, till he arose and abode wondering at his case. Hereupon the
 eunuch brought him a pair of sandals wrought with raw silk and green
 silk and purfled with red gold, and he took them and after examining
 them, set them in his sleeve. Whereat the castrato cried out and said:
 "Allah! Allah! O my lord, these are sandals for the treading of thy
 feet, so thou mayst wend to the wardrobe." Abu al-Hasan was
 confounded, and shaking the sandals from his sleeve, put them on his
 feet, whilst the Caliph died of laughter at him. The slave forewent
 him to the chapel of ease, where he entered, and doing his job, came
 out into the chamber, whereupon the slave girls brought him a basin of
 gold and a ewer of silver and poured water on his hands, and he made
 the wuzu ablution. Then they spread him a prayer carpet and he prayed.
 </p><p>  Now he knew not how to pray, and gave not over bowing and
 prostrating for twenty inclinations, pondering in himself the while
 and saying: "By Allah, I am none other than the Commander of the
 Faithful in very truth! This is assuredly no dream, for all these
 things happen not in a dream." And he was convinced and determined
 in himself that he was Prince of True Believers, so he pronounced
 the salaam and finished his prayers, whereupon the Mamelukes and slave
 girls came round about him with bundled suits of silken and linen
 stuffs and clad him in the costume of the caliphate and gave the royal
 dagger in his hand.
 </p><p>  Then the chief eunuch came in and said, "O Prince of True Believers,
 the Chamberlain is at the door craving permission to enter." Said
 he, "Let him enter!" whereupon he came in, and after kissing ground,
 offered the salutation, "Peace be upon thee, O Commander of the
 Faithful!" At this Abu al-Hasan rose and descended from the couch to
 the floor, whereupon the official exclaimed: "Allah! Allah! O Prince
 of True Believers, wottest thou not that all men are thy lieges and
 under thy rule and that it is not meet for the Caliph to rise to any
 man?" Presently the eunuch went out before him, and the little white
 slaves behind him, and they ceased not going till they raised the
 curtain and brought him into the hall of judgment and the throne
 room of the caliphate. There he saw all curtains and the forty doors
 and Al-'Ijli and Al-Rakashi the poet, and 'Ibdan and Jadim and Abu
 Ishak the cup companion, and beheld swords drawn and the lions
 compassing the throne as the white of the eye encircleth the black,
 and gilded glaives and death-dealing bows and Ajams and Arabs and
 Turks and Daylamites and folk and peoples and emirs and wazirs and
 captains and grandees and lords of the land and men of war in band,
 and in very sooth there appeared the might of the House of Abbas and
 the majesty of the Prophet's family.
 </p><p>  So he sat down upon the throne of the caliphate and set the dagger
 on his lap, whereupon all present came up to kiss ground between his
 hands and called down on him length of life and continuance of weal.
 Then came forward Ja'afar the Barmecide and, kissing the ground, said:
 "Be the wide world of Allah the treading of thy feet, and may Paradise
 be thy dwelling place and the fire the home of thy foes! Never may
 neighbor defy thee, nor the lights of fire die out for thee, O
 Caliph of all cities and ruler of all countries!" Therewithal Abu
 al-Hasan cried out at him and said, "O dog of the sons of Barmak, go
 down forthright, thou and the chief of the city police, to such a
 place in such a street, and deliver a hundred dinars of gold to the
 mother of Abu al-Hasan the Wag, and bear her my salutation. Then go to
 such a mosque and take the four Sheikhs and the imam and scourge
 each of them with a thousand lashes and mount them on beasts, face
 to tail, and parade them round about all the city and banish them to a
 place other than this city. And bid the crier make cry before them,
 saying: 'This is the reward and the least of the reward of whoso
 multiplieth words and molesteth his neighbors and damageth their
 delights and stinteth their eating and drinking!'"
 </p><p>  Ja'afar received the command and answered "With obedience," after
 which he went down from before Abu al-Hasan to the city and did all he
 had ordered him to do. Meanwhile, Abu al-Hasan abode in the caliphate,
 taking and giving, bidding and forbidding and carrying out his command
 till the end of the day, when he gave leave and permission to
 withdraw, and the emirs and officers of state departed to their
 several occupations and he looked toward the Chamberlain and the
 rest of the attendants and said, "Begone!" Then the eunuchs came to
 him, and calling down on him length of life and continuance of weal,
 walked in attendance upon him and raised the curtain, and he entered
 the pavilion of the harem, where he found candles lighted and lamps
 burning and singing women smiting on instruments, and ten slave girls,
 high-bosomed maids. When he saw this, he was confounded in his wit and
 said to himself, "By Allah, I am in truth Commander of the
 Faithful!" presently adding: "Or haply these are of the Jann, and he
 who was my guest yesternight was one of their kings who saw no way
 to requite my favors save by commanding his Ifrits to address me as
 Prince of True Believers. But an these be of the Jann, may Allah
 deliver me in safety from their mischief!"
 </p><p>  As soon as he appeared, the slave girls rose to him, and carrying
 him up on to the dais, brought him a great tray bespread with the
 richest viands. So he ate thereof with all his might and main, till he
 had gotten his fill, when he called one of the handmaids and said to
 her, "What is thy name?" Replied she, "My name is Miskah," and he said
 to another, "What is thy name?" Quoth she, "My name is Tarkah." Then
 he asked a third, "What is thy name?" who answered, "My name is
 Tohfah." And he went on to question the damsels of their names, one
 after other, till he had learned the ten, when he rose from that place
 and removed to the wine chamber. He found it every way complete, and
 saw therein ten great trays, covered with all fruits and cates and
 every sort of sweetmeats. So he sat down and ate thereof after the
 measure of his competency, and finding there three troops of singing
 girls, was amazed, and made the girls eat.
 </p><p>  Then he sat and the singers also seated themselves, whilst the black
 slaves and the white slaves and the eunuchs and pages and boys
 stood, and of the slave girls some sat and others stood. The damsels
 sang and warbled all varieties of melodies and the place rang with the
 sweetness of the songs, whilst the pipes cried out and the lutes
 with them wailed, till it seemed to Abu al-Hasan that he was in
 Paradise, and his heart was heartened and his breast broadened. So
 he sported, and joyaunce grew on him and he bestowed robes of honor on
 the damsels and gave and bestowed, challenging this girl and kissing
 that and toying with a third, plying one with wine and morseling
 another with meat, till nightfall.
 </p><p>  All this while the Commander of the Faithful was diverting himself
 with watching him and laughing, and when night fell he bade one of the
 slave girls drop a piece of bhang in the cup and give it to Abu
 al-Hasan to drink. So she did his bidding and gave him the cup,
 which no sooner had he drunk than his head forewent his feet.
 Therewith the Caliph came forth from behind the curtain laughing,
 and calling to the attendant who had brought Abu al-Hasan to the
 palace, said to him, "Carry this man to his own place." So Masrur took
 him up, and carrying him to his own house, set him down in the saloon.
 Then he went forth from him, and shutting the saloon door upon him,
 returned to the Caliph, who slept till the morrow.
 </p><p>  As for Abu al-Hasan, he gave not over slumbering till Almighty Allah
 brought on the morning, when he recovered from the drug and awoke,
 crying out and saying: "Ho, Tuffahah! Ho, Rahat al-Kulub! Ho,
 Miskah! Ho, Tohfah!" And he ceased not calling upon the palace
 handmaids till his mother heard him summoning strange damsels, and
 rising, came to him and said: "Allah's name encompass thee! Up with
 thee, O my son, O Abu al-Hasan! Thou dreamest." So he opened his eyes,
 and finding an old woman at his head, raised his eyes and said to her,
 "Who art thou?" Quoth she, "I am thy mother," and quoth he: "Thou
 liest! I am the Commander of the Faithful the Viceregent of Allah."
 Whereupon his mother shrieked aloud and said to him: "Heaven
 preserve thy reason! Be silent, O my son, and cause not the loss of
 our lives and the wasting of thy wealth, which will assuredly befall
 us if any hear this talk and carry it to the Caliph."
 </p><p>  So he rose from his sleep, and finding himself in his own saloon and
 his mother by him, had doubts of his wit, and said to her: "By
 Allah, O my mother, I saw myself in a dream in a palace, with slave
 girls and Mamelukes about me and in attendance upon me, and I sat upon
 the throne of the Caliphate and ruled. By Allah, O my mother, this
 is what I saw, and in very sooth it was no dream!" Then he bethought
 himself awhile and said: "Assuredly, I am Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a, and
 this that I saw was only a dream when I was made Caliph and bade and
 forbade." Then he bethought himself again and said: "Nay, but 'twas
 not a dream, and I am none other than the Caliph, and indeed I gave
 gifts and bestowed honor robes." Quoth his mother to him: "O my son,
 thou sportest with thy reason. Thou wilt go to the madhouse and become
 a gazingstock. Indeed, that which thou hast seen is only from the Foul
 Fiend, and it was an imbroglio of dreams, for at times Satan
 sporteth with men's wits in all manner of ways."
 </p><p>  Then said she to him, "O my son, was there anyone with thee
 yesternight?" And he reflected and said: "Yes, one lay the night
 with me and I acquainted him with my case and told him my tale.
 Doubtless, he was of the devils, and I, O my mother, even as thou
 sayst truly, am Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a." She rejoined: "O my son,
 rejoice in tidings of all good, for yesterday's record is that there
 came the Wazir Ja'afar the Barmecide and his many, and beat the
 Sheikhs of the mosque and the imam, each a thousand lashes, after
 which they paraded them round about the city, making proclamation
 before them and saying, 'This is the reward and the least of the
 reward of whoso faileth in goodwill to his neighbors and troubleth
 on them their lives!' And he banished them from Baghdad. Moreover, the
 Caliph sent me a hundred dinars and sent to salute me."
 </p><p>  Whereupon Abu al-Hasan cried out and said to her: "O ill-omened
 crone, wilt thou contradict me and tell me that I am not the Prince of
 True Believers? 'Twas I who commanded Ja'afar the Barmecide to beat
 the Sheikhs and parade them about the city and make proclamation
 before them, and 'twas I, very I, who sent thee the hundred dinars and
 sent to salute thee, and I, O beldam of ill luck, am in very deed
 the Commander of the Faithful, and thou art a liar, who would make
 me out an idiot." So saying, he rose up and fell upon her and beat her
 with a staff of almond wood, till she cried out "Help, O Moslems!" And
 he increased the beating upon her till the folk heard her cries, and
 coming to her, found Abu al-Hasan bashing his mother and saying to
 her: "Old woman of ill omen, am I not the Commander of the Faithful?
 Thou hast ensorceled me!" When the folk heard his words, they said,
 "This man raveth," and doubted not of his madness.
 </p><p>  So they came in upon him, and seizing him, pinioned his elbows,
 and bore him to the bedlam. Quoth the superintendant, "What aileth
 this youth?" and quoth they, "This is a madman, afflicted of the
 Jinn." "By Allah," cried Abu al-Hasan, "they lie against me! I am no
 madman, but the Commander of the Faithful." And the superintendent
 answered him, saying, "None lieth but thou, O foulest of the
 Jinn-maddened!" Then he stripped him of his clothes, and clapping on
 his neck a heavy chain, bound him to a high lattice and fell to
 beating him two bouts a day and two a-nights, and he ceased not
 abiding on this wise the space of ten days. Then his mother came to
 him and said: "O my son, O Abu al-Hasan, return to thy right reason,
 for this is the Devil's doing." Quoth he: "Thou sayest sooth, O my
 mother, and bear thou witness of me that I repeat me of that talk
 and turn me from my madness. So do thou deliver me, for I am nigh upon
 death." Accordingly his mother went out to the superintendent and
 procured his release, and he returned to his own house.
 </p><p>  Now this was at the beginning of the month, and when it ended, Abu
 al-Hasan longed to drink liquor and, returning to his former habit,
 furnished his saloon and made ready food and bade bring wine. Then,
 going forth to the bridge, he sat there, expecting one whom he
 should converse and carouse with, according to his custom. As he sat
 thus, behold, up came the Caliph and Masrur to him, but Abu al-Hasan
 saluted them not and said to Al-Rashid, "No friendly welcome to
 thee, O King of the Jann!" Quoth Al-Rashid, "What have I done to
 thee?" and quoth Abu al-Hasan, "What more couldst thou do than what
 thou hast done to me, O foulest of the Jann? I have been beaten and
 thrown into bedlam, where all said I was Jinn-mad, and this was caused
 by none save thyself. I brought thee to my house and fed thee with
 my best, after which thou dist empower thy Satans and Marids to
 disport themselves with my wits from morning to evening. So avaunt and
 aroynt thee and wend thy ways!"
 </p><p>  The Caliph smiled and, seating himself by his side, said to him,
 "O my brother, did I not tell thee that I would return to thee?" Quoth
 Abu al-Hasan, "I have no need of thee, and as the byword sayeth in
 verse:
 </p><p>  "Fro' my friend, 'twere meeter and wiser to part,
 <br>  For what eye sees not born shall ne'er sorrow heart."
 <br></p><p>And indeed, O my brother, the night thou camest to me and we conversed
 and caroused together, I and thou, 'twas as if the Devil came to me
 and troubled me that night." Asked the Caliph, "And who is he, the
 Devil?" and answered Abu al-Hasan, "He is none other than thou."
 Whereat the Caliph laughed and coaxed him and spake him fair,
 saying: "O my brother, when I went out from thee, I forgot the door
 and left it open, and perhaps Satan came in to thee." Quoth Abu
 al-Hasan: "Ask me not of that which hath betided me. What possessed
 thee to leave the door open, so that the Devil came in to me and there
 befell me with him this and that?" And he related to him all that
 had betided him, first and last (and in repetition is no fruition),
 what while the Caliph laughed and hid his laughter.
 </p><p>  Then said he to Abu al-Hasan: "Praised be Allah who hath done away
 from thee whatso irked thee, and that I see thee once more in weal!"
 And Abu al-Hasan said: "Never again will I take thee to cup
 companion or sitting comrade, for the proverb saith, 'Whoso
 stumbleth on a stone and thereto returneth, upon him be blame and
 reproach.' And thou, O my brother, nevermore will I entertain thee nor
 company with thee, for that I have not found thy heel propitious to
 me." But the Caliph coaxed him and said, "I have been the means of thy
 winning to thy wish anent the imam and the Sheikhs." Abu al-Hasan
 replied, "Thou hast," and Al-Rashid continued, "And haply somewhat may
 betide which shall gladden thy heart yet more." Abu al-Hasan asked,
 "What dost thou require of me?" and the Commander of the Faithful
 answered: "Verily, I am thy guest. Reject not the guest." Quoth Abu
 al-Hasan: "On condition that thou swear to me by the characts on the
 seal of Solomon, David's son (on the twain be the peace!) that thou
 wilt not suffer thine Ifrits to make fun of me." He replied, "To
 hear is to obey!"
 </p><p>  Whereupon the wag took him and brought him into the saloon and set
 food before him and entreated him with friendly speech. Then he told
 him all that had befallen him, whilst the Caliph was like to die of
 stifled laughter. After which Abu al-Hasan removed the tray of food,
 and bringing the wine service, filled a cup and cracked it three
 times, then gave it to the Caliph, saying: "O boon companion mine, I
 am thy slave, and let not that which I am about to say offend thee,
 and be thou not vexed, neither do thou vex me." And he recited these
 verses:
 </p><p>   "Hear one that wills thee well! Lips none shall bless
 <br>   Save those who drink for drunk and all transgress.
 <br>   Ne'er will I cease to swill while night falls dark
 <br>   Till lout my forehead low upon my tass.
 <br>   In wine like liquid sun is my delight
 <br>   Which clears all care and gladdens allegresse."
 <br></p><p>  When the Caliph heard these his verses and saw how apt he was at
 couplets, he was delighted with exceeding delight, and taking the cup,
 drank it off, and the twain ceased not to converse and carouse till
 the wine rose to their heads. Then quoth Abu al-Hasan to the Caliph:
 "O boon companion mine, of a truth I am perplexed concerning my
 affair, for meseemed I was Commander of the Faithful and ruled and
 gave gifts and largess, and in very deed, O my brother, it was not a
 dream." Quoth the Caliph, "These were the imbroglios of sleep," and
 crumbling a bit of bhang into the cup, said to him, "By my life, do
 thou drink this cup," and said Abu al-Hasan, "Surely I will drink it
 from thy hand." Then he took the cup and drank it off, and no sooner
 had it settled in his stomach than his head fell to the ground
 before his feet. Now his manners and fashions pleased the Caliph,
 and the excellence of his composition and his frankness, and he said
 in himself, "I will assuredly make him my cup companion and sitting
 comrade." So he rose forthright, and saying to Masrur, "Take him
 up," returned to the palace.
 </p><p>  Accordingly, the eunuch took up Abu al-Hasan, and carrying him to
 the palace of the caliphate, set him down before Al-Rashid, who bade
 the slaves and slave girls compass him about, whilst he himself hid in
 a place where Abu al-Hasan could not see him. Then he commanded one of
 the handmaidens to take the lute and strike it over the wag's head,
 whilst the rest smote upon their instruments. So they played and sang,
 till Abu al-Hasan awoke at the last of the night and heard the
 symphony of lutes and tambourines and the sound of the flutes and
 the singing of the slave girls, whereupon he opened eyes, and
 finding himself in the palace, with the handmaids and eunuchs about
 him, exclaimed: "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in
 Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Come to my help this night, which
 meseems more unlucky than the former! Verily, I am fearful of the
 madhouse and of that which I suffered therein the first time, and I
 doubt not but the Devil is come to me again, as before. O Allah, my
 Lord, put thou Satan to shame!" Then he shut his eyes and laid his
 head in his sleeve, and fell to laughing softly and raising his head
 betimes, but still found the apartment lighted and the girls singing.
 </p><p>  Presently one of the eunuchs sat down at his head and said to him,
 "Sit up, O Prince of True Believers, and look on thy palace and thy
 slave girls." Said Abu al-Hasan: "Under the veil of Allah, am I in
 truth Commander of the Faithful, and dost thou not lie? Yesterday I
 rode not forth, neither ruled, but drank and slept, and this eunuch
 cometh to make me rise." Then he sat up and recalled to thought that
 which had betided him with his mother and how he had beaten her and
 entered the bedlam, and he saw the marks of the beating wherewith
 the superintendant had beaten him, and was perplexed concerning his
 affair and pondered in himself, saying, "By Allah, I know not how my
 case is nor what is this that betideth me!" Then, gazing at the
 scene around him, he said privily, "All these are of the Jann in human
 shape, and I commit my case to Allah."
 </p><p>  Presently he turned to one of the damsels and said to her, "Who am
 I?" Quoth she, "Thou art the Commander of the Faithful," and quoth he:
 "Thou liest, O calamity! If I be indeed the Commander of the Faithful,
 bite my finger." So she came to him and bit it with all her might, and
 he said to her, "It doth suffice." Then he asked the chief eunuch,
 "Who am I?" and he answered, "Thou art the Commander of the Faithful."
 So he left him and returned to his wonderment. Then, turning to a
 little white slave, said to him, "Bite my ear," and he bent his head
 low down to him and put his ear to his mouth. Now the Mameluke was
 young and lacked sense, so he closed his teeth upon Abu al-Hasan's ear
 with all his might, till he came near to sever it. And he knew not
 Arabic, so as often as the wag said to him, "It doth suffice," he
 concluded that he said, "Bite like a vice," and redoubled his bite and
 made his teeth meet in the ear, whilst the damsels were diverted
 from him with hearkening to the singing girls, and Abu al-Hasan
 cried out for succor from the boy and the Caliph lost his senses for
 laughter.
 </p><p>  Then he dealt the boy a cuff, and he let go his ear, whereupon all
 present fell down with laughter and said to the little Mameluke,
 "Art mad that thou bitest the Caliph's ear on this wise?" And Abu
 al-Hasan cried to them: "Sufficeth ye not, O ye wretched Jinns, that
 which hath befallen me? But the fault is not yours. The fault is of
 your chief, who transmewed you from Jinn shape to mortal shape. I seek
 refuge against you this night by the Throne Verse and the Chapter of
 Sincerity and the Two Preventives!" So saying, the wag put off his
 clothes till he was naked, with prickle and breech exposed, and danced
 among the slave girls. They bound his hands and he wantoned among
 them, while they died of laughing at him and the Caliph swooned away
 for excess of laughter.
 </p><p>  Then he came to himself, and going forth the curtain to Abu
 al-Hasan, said to him: "Out on thee, O Abu al-Hasan! Thou slayest me
 with laughter." So he turned to him, and knowing him, said to him, "By
 Allah, 'tis thou slayest me and slayest my mother and slewest the
 Sheikhs and the imam of the mosque!" After which he kissed ground
 before him and prayed for the permanence of his prosperity and the
 endurance of his days. The Caliph at once robed him in a rich robe and
 gave him a thousand dinars, and presently he took the wag into
 especial favor and married him and bestowed largess on him and
 lodged him with himself in the palace and made him of the chief of his
 cup companions, and indeed he was preferred with him above them, and
 the Caliph advanced him over them all, so that he sat with him and the
 Lady Zubaydah bint al-Kasim, whose treasuress, Nuzhat al-Fuad hight,
 was given to him in marriage.
 </p><p>  After this Abu al-Hasan the wag abode with his wife in eating and
 drinking and all delight of life, till whatso was with them went the
 way of money, when he said to her, "Harkye, O Nuzhat al-Fuad!" Said
 she, "At thy service," and he continued, "I have it in mind to play
 a trick on the Caliph, and thou shalt do the like with the Lady
 Zubaydah, and we will take of them at once, to begin with, two hundred
 dinars and two pieces of silk." She rejoined, "As thou willest, but
 what thinkest thou to do?" And he said: "We will feign ourselves dead,
 and this is the trick. I will die before thee and lay myself out,
 and do thou spread over me a silken napkin and loose my turban over me
 and tie my toes and lay on my stomach a knife and a little salt.
 Then let down thy hair and betake thyself to thy mistress Zubaydah,
 tearing thy dress and slapping thy face and crying out. She will ask
 thee, 'What aileth thee?' and do thou answer her, 'May thy head
 outlive Abu al-Hasan the wag, for he is dead.' She will mourn for me
 and weep and bid her new treasuress give thee a hundred dinars and a
 piece of silk and will say to thee, 'Go, lay him out and carry him
 forth.' So do thou take of her the hundred dinars and the piece of
 silk and come back, and when thou returnest to me, I will rise up
 and thou shalt lie down in my place, and I will go to the Caliph and
 say to him, 'May thy head outlive Nuzhat al-Fuad,' and rend my raiment
 and pluck out my beard. He will mourn for thee and say to his
 treasurer, 'Give Abu al-Hasan a hundred dinars and a piece of silk.'
 Then he will say to me, 'Go, lay her out and carry her forth,' and I
 will come back to thee."
 </p><p>  Therewith Nuzhat al-Fuad rejoiced and said, "Indeed, this is an
 excellent device." Then Abu al-Hasan stretched himself out
 forthright and she shut his eyes and tied his feet and covered him
 with the napkin and did whatso her lord had bidden her. After which
 she tare her gear and bared her head and letting down her hair, went
 in to the Lady Zubaydah, crying out and weeping. When the Princess saw
 her in this state, she cried: "What plight is this? What is thy story,
 and what maketh thee weep?" And Nuzhatal-Fuad answered, weeping and
 loud-wailing the while: "O my lady, may thy head live and mayst thou
 survive Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a, for he is dead!" The Lady Zubaydah
 mourned for him and said, "Alas, poor Abu al-Hasan the wag!" and she
 shed tears for him awhile. Then she bade her treasuress give Nuzhat
 al-Fuad a hundred dinars and a piece of silk and said to her, "O
 Nuzhat al-Fuad, go, lay him out and carry him forth."
 </p><p>  So she took the hundred dinars and the piece of silk and returned to
 her dwelling, rejoicing, and went in to her spouse and acquainted
 him what had befallen, whereupon he arose and rejoiced and girdled his
 middle and danced and took the hundred dinars and the piece of silk
 and laid them up. Then he laid out Nuzhat al-Fuad and did with her
 as she had done with him, after which he rent his raiment and
 plucked out his beard and disordered his turban and ran out, nor
 ceased running till he came in to the Caliph, who was sitting in the
 judgment hall, and he in this plight, beating his breast. The Caliph
 asked him, "What aileth thee, O Abu al-Hasan?" and he wept and
 answered, "Would Heaven thy cup companion had never been, and would
 his hour had never come!" Quoth the Caliph, "Tell me thy case," and
 quoth Abu al-Hasan, "O my lord, may thy head outlive Nuzhat
 al-Fuad!" The Caliph exclaimed, "There is no god but God," and smote
 hand upon hand. Then he comforted Abu al-Hasan and said to him,
 "Grieve not, for we will bestow upon thee a bedfellow other than she."
 And he ordered the treasurer to give him a hundred dinars and a piece
 of silk. Accordingly the treasurer did what the Caliph bade him, and
 Al-Rashid said to him, "Go, lay her out and carry her forth and make
 her a handsome funeral."
 </p><p>  So Abu al-Hasan took that which he had given him and returning to
 his house, rejoicing, went in to Nuzhat al-Fuad and said to her,
 "Arise, for our wish" is won." Hereat she arose and he laid before her
 the hundred ducats and the piece of silk, whereat she rejoiced, and
 they added the gold to the gold and the silk to the silk and sat
 talking and laughing each to other.
 </p><p>  Meanwhile, when Abu al-Hasan fared forth the presence of the
 Caliph and went to lay out Nuzhat al-Fuad, the Commander of the
 Faithful mourned for her, and dismissing the Divan, arose and betook
 himself, leaning upon Masrur, the Sworder of his vengeance, to the
 Lady Zubaydah, that he might condole with her for her handmaid. He
 found her sitting weeping and awaiting his coming, so she might
 condole with him for his boon companion Abu al-Hasan the wag. So he
 said to her, "May thy head outlive thy slave girl Nuzhat al-Fuad!" and
 said she: "O my lord, Allah preserve my slave girl! Mayst thou live
 and long survive thy boon companion Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a, for he is
 dead." The Caliph smiled and said to his eunuch: "O Masrur, verily
 women are little of wit. Allah upon thee, say, was not Abu al-Hasan
 with me but now?" Quoth the Lady Zubaydah, laughing from a heart
 full of wrath: "Wilt thou not leave thy jesting? Sufficeth thee not
 that Abu al-Hasan is dead, but thou must put to death my slave girl
 also and bereave us of the twain, and style me little of wit?" The
 Caliph answered, "Indeed, 'tis Nuzhat al-Fuad who is dead." And the
 Lady Zubaydah said: "Indeed he hath not been with thee, nor hast
 thou seen him, and none was with me but now save Nuzhat al-Fuad, and
 she sorrowful, weeping, with her clothes torn to tatters. I exhorted
 her to patience and gave her a hundred dinars and a piece of silk, and
 indeed I was awaiting thy coming, so I might console thee for thy
 cup companion Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a, and was about to send for
 thee." The Caliph laughed and said, "None is dead save Nuzhat
 al-Fuad," and she, "No, no, good my lord; none is dead but Abu
 al-Hasan the wag."
 </p><p>  With this the Caliph waxed wroth, and the hashimi vein started out
 from between his eyes and throbbed, and he cried out to Masrur and
 said to him, "Fare thee forth to the house of Abu al-Hasan the wag,
 and see which of them is dead." So Masrur went out, running, and the
 Caliph said to the Lady Zubaydah, "Wilt thou lay me a wager?" And said
 she, "Yes, I will wager, and I say that Abu al-Hasan is dead."
 Rejoined the Caliph: "And I wager and say that none is dead save
 Nuzhat al-Fuad, and the stake between me and thee shall be the
 Garden of Pleasaunce against thy palace and the Pavilion of Pictures."
 So they agreed upon this and sat awaiting Masrur's return with the
 news.
 </p><p>  As for the eunuch, he ceased not running till he came to the
 by-street wherein was the stead of Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a. Now the
 wag was comfortably seated and leaning back against the lattice, and
 chancing to look round, saw Masrur running along the street and said
 to Nuzhat al-Fuad, "Meseemeth the Caliph, when I went forth from
 him, dismissed the Divan and went in to the Lady Zubaydah to condole
 with her, whereupon she arose and condoled with him, saying, 'Allah
 increase thy recompense for the loss of Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a!'
 And he said to her, 'None is dead save Nuzhat al-Fuad, may thy head
 outlive her!' Quoth she, ''Tis not she who is dead, but Abu al-Hasan
 al-Khali'a, thy boon companion.' And quoth he, 'None is dead save
 Nuzhat al-Fuad.' And they waxed so obstinate that the Caliph became
 wroth and they laid a wager, and he hath sent Masrur the Sworder to
 see who is dead. Now, therefore, 'twere best that thou lie down, so he
 may sight thee and go and acquaint the Caliph and confirm my saying."
 </p><p>  So Nuzhat al-Fuad stretched herself out and Abu al-Hasan covered her
 with her mantilla and sat weeping at her head. Presently, Masrur,
 the eunuch, suddenly came in to him and saluted him, and seeing Nuzhat
 al-Fuad stretched out, uncovered her face and said: "There is no god
 but God! Our sister Nuzhat al-Fuad is dead indeed. How sudden was
 the stroke of Destiny! Allah have ruth on thee and acquit thee of
 all charge!" Then he returned and related what had passed before the
 Caliph and the Lady Zubaydah, and he laughing as he spoke. "O accursed
 one," cried the Caliph: "this is no time for laughter! Tell us which
 is dead of them." Masrur replied: "By Allah, O my lord, Abu al-Hasan
 is well, and none is dead but Nuzhat al-Fuad." Quoth the Caliph to
 Zubaydah, "Thou hast lost thy pavilion in thy play," and he jeered
 at her. and said, "O Masrur, tell her what thou sawest."
 </p><p>  Quoth the eunuch: "Verily, O my lady, I ran without ceasing till I
 came in to Abu al-Hasan in his house, and found Nuzhat al-Fuad lying
 dead and Abu al-Hasan sitting tearful at her head. I saluted him and
 condoled with him and sat down by his side and uncovered the face of
 Nuzhat al-Fuad and saw her dead and her face swollen. So I said to
 him, 'Carry her out forthwith, so we may pray over her.' He replied,
 ''Tis well,' and I left him to lay her out and came hither, that I
 might tell you the news." The Prince of True Believers laughed and
 said, "Tell it again and again to thy lady Little-wits." When the Lady
 Zubaydah heard Masrur's words and those of the Caliph she was wroth
 and said, "None is little of wit save he who believeth a black slave."
 And she abused Masrur, whilst the Commander of the Faithful laughed;
 and the eunuch, vexed at this, said to the Caliph, "He spake sooth who
 said, 'Women are little of wits and lack religion."'
 </p><p>  Then said the Lady Zubaydah to the Caliph: "O Commander of the
 Faithful, thou sportest and jestest with me, and this slave
 hoodwinketh me, the better to please thee. But I will send and see
 which of them be dead." And he answered, saying, "Send one who shall
 see which of them is dead." So the Lady Zubaydah cried out to an old
 duenna, and said to her: "Hie thee to the house of Nuzhat al-Fuad in
 haste and see who is dead, and loiter not." And she used hard words to
 her. So the old woman went out running, whilst the Prince of True
 Believers and Masrur laughed, and she ceased not running till she came
 into the street. Abu al-Hasan saw her, and knowing her, said to his
 wife: "O Nuzhat al-Fuad, meseemeth the Lady Zubaydah hath sent to us
 to see who is dead and hath not given credit to Masrur's report of thy
 death. Accordingly she hath dispatched the old crone, her duenna, to
 discover the truth. So it behooveth me to be dead in my turn for the
 sake of thy credit with the Lady Zubaydah."
 </p><p>  Hereat he lay down and stretched himself out, and she covered him
 and bound his eyes and feet and sat in tears at his head. Presently
 the old woman came in to her and saw her sitting at Abu al-Hasan's
 head, weeping and recounting his fine qualities; and when she saw
 the old trot, she cried out and said to her: "See what hath befallen
 me! Indeed Abu al-Hasan is dead and hath left me lone and lorn!"
 Then she shrieked out and rent her raiment and said to the crone, "O
 my mother, how very good he was to me!" Quoth the other, "Indeed
 thou art excused, for thou wast used to him and he to thee."
 </p><p>  Then she considered what Masrur had reported to the Caliph and the
 Lady Zubaydah and said to her, "Indeed, Masrur goeth about to cast
 discord between the Caliph and the Lady Zubaydah." Asked Nuzhat
 al-Fuad, "And what is the cause of discord, O my mother?" and the
 other replied: "O my daughter, Masrur came to the Caliph and the
 Lady Zubaydah and gave them news of thee that thou wast dead and
 that Abu al-Hasan was well." Nuzhat al-Fuad said to her: "O naunty
 mine, I was with my lady just now and she gave me a hundred dinars and
 a piece of silk, and now see my case and that which hath befallen
 me! Indeed I am bewildered, and how shall I do, and I lone and lorn?
 Would Heaven I had died and he had lived!" Then she wept and with
 her wept the old woman, who, going up to Abu al-Hasan and uncovering
 his face, saw his eyes bound and swollen for the swathing. So she
 covered him again and said, "Indeed, O Nuzhat al-Fuad, thou art
 afflicted in Abu al-Hasan!"
 </p><p>  Then she condoled with her, and going out from her, ran along the
 street till she came into the Lady Zubaydah and related to her the
 story, and the Princess said to her, laughing: "Tell it over again
 to the Caliph, who maketh me out little of wit, and lacking of
 religion, and who made this ill-omened liar of a slave presume to
 contradict me." Quoth Masrur, "This old woman lieth, for I saw Abu
 al-Hasan well and Nuzhat al-Fuad it was who lay dead." Quoth the
 duenna, "'Tis thou that liest, and wouldst fain cast discord-between
 the Caliph and the Lady Zubaydah." And Masrur cried, "None lieth but
 thou, O old woman of ill omen, and thy lady believeth thee, and she
 must be in her dotage." Whereupon the Lady Zubaydah cried out at him,
 and in very sooth she was enraged with him and with his speech and
 shed tears.
 </p><p>  Then said the Caliph to her: "I lie and my eunuch lieth, and thou
 liest and thy waiting-woman lieth, so 'tis my rede we go, all four
 of us together, that we may see which of us telleth the truth." Masrur
 said: "Come, let us go, that I may do to this ill-omened old woman
 evil deeds and deal her a sound drubbing for her lying." And the
 duenna answered him: "O dotard, is thy wit like into my wit? Indeed
 thy wit is as the hen's wit." Masrur was incensed at her words and
 would have laid violent hands on her, but the Lady Zubaydah pushed him
 away from her and said to him, "Her truthspeaking will presently be
 distinguished from thy truth-speaking and her leasing from thy
 leasing." Then they all four arose, laying wagers one with other,
 and went forth afoot from the palace gate and hied on till they came
 in at the gate of the street where Abu al-Hasan al-Khali'a dwelt.
 </p><p>  He saw them, and said to his wife, Nuzhat al-Fuad: "Verily, all that
 is sticky is not a pancake they cook, nor every time shall the crock
 escape the shock. It seemeth the old woman hath gone and told her lady
 and acquainted her with our case and she hath disputed with Masrur,
 the eunuch, and they have laid wagers each with other about our
 death and are come to us, all four, the Caliph and the eunuch and
 the Lady Zubaydah and the old trot." When Nuzhat al-Fuad heard this,
 she started up from her outstretched posture and asked, "How shall
 we do?" whereto he answered, "We will both feign ourselves dead
 together and stretch ourselves out and hold out breath." So she
 hearkened unto him and they both lay down on the place where they
 usually slept the siesta and bound their feet and shut their eyes
 and covered themselves with the veil and held their breath.
 </p><p>  Presently up came the Caliph, Zubaydah, Masrur, and the old woman,
 and entering, found Abu al-Hasan the wag and wife both stretched out
 as dead, which when the Lady saw, she wept and said: "They ceased
 not to bring ill news of my slave girl till she died. Methinketh Abu
 al-Hasan's death was grievous to her and that she died after him."
 Quoth the Caliph: "Thou shalt not prevent me with thy prattle and
 prate. She certainly died before Abu al-Hasan, for he came to me
 with his raiment rent and his beard plucked out, beating his breast
 with two bits of unbaked brick, and I gave him a hundred dinars and
 a piece of silk and said too him, 'Go, bear her forth, and I will give
 thee a bedfellow other than she and handsomer, and she shall be
 instead of her.' But it would appear that her death was no light
 matter to him and he died after her, so it is I who have beaten thee
 and gotten thy stake." The Lady Zubaydah answered him in words galore,
 and the dispute between them waxed sore.
 </p><p>  At last the Caliph sat down at the heads of the pair and said: "By
 the tomb of the Apostle of Allah (whom may He save and assain!) and
 the sepulchers of my fathers and forefathers, whoso will tell me which
 of them died before the other, I will willingly give him a thousand
 dinars!" When Abu al-Hasan heard the Caliph's words, he sprang up in
 haste and said: "I died first, O Commander of the Faithful! Here
 with the thousand dinars, and acquit thee of thine oath and the
 swear thou sworest." Nuzhat al-Fuad rose also and stood up before
 the Caliph and the Lady Zubaydah, who both rejoiced in this and in
 their safety, and the Princess chid her slave girl. Then the Caliph
 and Zubaydah gave them joy of their well-being and knew that this
 death was a trick to get the gold, and the Lady said to Nuzhat
 al-Fuad: "Thou shouldst have sought of me that which thou neededst,
 without this fashion, and not have burned my heart for thee." And she,
 "Verily, I was ashamed, O my lady."
 </p><p>  As for the Caliph, he swooned away for laughing and said, "O Abu
 al-Hasan, thou wilt never cease to be a wag and do peregrine things
 and prodigious!" Quoth he: "O Commander of the Faithful, this trick
 I played off for that the money which thou gavest me was exhausted,
 and I was ashamed to ask of thee again. When I was single, I could
 never keep money in hand, but since thou marriedst me to this
 damsel, if I possessed even thy wealth, I should lay it waste.
 Wherefore when all that was in my hand was spent, I wrought this
 sleight so I might get of thee the hundred dinars and the piece of
 silk, and all this is an alms from our lord. But now make haste to
 give me the thousand dinars and acquit thee of thine oath." The Caliph
 and the Lady Zubaydah laughed and returned to the palace, and he
 gave Abu al-Hasan the thousand dinars saying, "Take them as a
 douceur for thy perservation from death," whilst her mistress did
 the like with Nuzhat al-Fuad, honoring her with the same words.
 Moreover, the Caliph increased the wag in his solde and supplies,
 and he and his wife ceased not to live in joy and contentment till
 there came to them the Destroyer of delights and Severer of societies,
 the Plunderer of palaces, and the Gamerer of graves.
