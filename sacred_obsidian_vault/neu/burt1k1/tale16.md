 <center><h1>     THE ANGEL OF DEATH WITH THE PROUD AND THE DEVOUT MAN
 </h1></center><p>  IT is related, O auspicious King, that one of the olden monarchs was
 once minded to ride out in state with the officers of his realm and
 the grandees of his retinue and display to the folk the marvels of his
 magnificence. So he ordered his lords and emirs equip them therefor
 and commanded his keeper of the wardrobe to bring him of the richest
 of raiment, such as befitted the King in his state, and he bade them
 bring his steeds of the finest breeds and pedigrees every man heeds.
 Which being done, he chose out of the raiment what rejoiced him most
 and of the horses that which he deemed best, and donning the
 clothes, together with a collar set with margarites and rubies and all
 manner jewels, mounted and set forth in state, making his destrier
 prance and curvet among his troops and glorying in his pride and
 despotic power.
 </p><p>  And Iblis came to him and, laying his hand upon his nose, blew
 into his nostrils the breath of hauteur and conceit, so that he
 magnified and glorified himself and said in his heart, "Who among
 men is like unto me?" And he became so pulled up with arrogance and
 self-sufficiency, and so taken up with the thought of his own splendor
 and magnificence, that he would not vouchsafe a glance to any man.
 Presently there stood before him one clad in tattered clothes and
 saluted him, but he returned not his salaam, whereupon the stranger
 laid hold of his horse's bridle. "Lift thy hand!" cried the King.
 "Thou knowest not whose bridle rein it is whereof thou takest hold."
 Quoth the other, "I have a need of thee." Quoth the King, "Wait till I
 alight, and then name thy need." Rejoined the stranger, "It is a
 secret and I will not tell it but in thine ear." So the King bowed his
 head to him and he said, "I am the Angel of Death and I purpose to
 take thy soul." Replied the King, "Have patience with me a little,
 whilst I return to my house and take leave of my people and children
 and neighbors and wife." "By no means so," answered the Angel. "Thou
 shalt never return nor look on them again, for the fated term of
 thy life is past."
 </p><p>  So saying, he took the soul of the King (who fell off his horse's
 back dead) and departed thence. Presently the Death Angel met a devout
 man, of whom Almighty Allah had accepted, and saluted him. He returned
 the salute, and the Angel said to him, "O pious man, I have a need
 of thee which must be kept secret." "Tell it in my ear," quoth the
 devotee, and quoth the other, "I am the Angel of Death." Replied the
 man: "Welcome to thee! And praised be Allah for thy coming! I am
 aweary of awaiting thine arrival, for indeed long hath been thine
 absence from the lover which longeth for thee." Said the Angel, "If
 thou have any business, make an end of it," but the other answered,
 saying, "There is nothing so urgent to me as the meeting with my Lord,
 to whom be honor and glory!" And the Angel said, "How wouldst thou
 fain have me take thy soul? I am bidden to take it as thou willest and
 choosest." He replied, "Tarry till I make the wuzu ablution and
 pray, and when I prostrate myself, then take my soul while my body
 is on the ground." Quoth the Angel, "Verily, my Lord (be He extolled
 and exalted!) commanded me not to take thy soul but with thy consent
 and as thou shouldst wish, so I will do thy will." Then the devout man
 made the minor ablution and prayed, and the Angel of Death took his
 soul in the act of prostration and Almighty Allah transported it to
 the place of mercy and acceptance and forgiveness.
