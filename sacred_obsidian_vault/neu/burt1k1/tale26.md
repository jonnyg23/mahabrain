 <center><h1>              KHALIFAH THE FISHERMAN OF BAGHDAD
 </h1></center><p>  THERE was once in tides of yore and in ages and times long gone
 before in the city of Baghdad a fisherman, Khalifah hight, a pauper
 wight, who had never once been married in all his days. It chanced one
 morning that he took his net and went with it to the river as was
 his wont, with the view of fishing before the others came. When he
 reached the bank, he girt himself and tucked up his skirts. Then
 stepping into the water, he spread his net and cast it a first cast
 and a second, but it brought up naught. He ceased not to throw it till
 he had made ten casts, and still naught came up therein, wherefore his
 breast was straitened and his mind perplexed concerning his case and
 he said: "I crave pardon of God the Great, there is no god but He, the
 Living, the Eternal, and unto Him I repent. There is no Majesty and
 there is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great! Whatso He
 willeth is and whatso He nilleth is not! Upon Allah (to Whom belong
 Honor and Glory!) dependeth daily bread! When as He giveth to His
 servant, none denieth him; and when as He denieth a servant, none
 giveth to him." And of the excess of his distress, he recited these
 two couplets:
 </p><p>     "An Fate afflict thee, with grief manifest,
 <br>     Prepare thy patience and make broad thy breast;
 <br>     For of His grace the Lord of all the worlds
 <br>     Shall send to wait upon unrest sweet Rest."
 <br></p><p>  Then he said in his mind, "I will make this one more cast,
 trusting in Allah, so haply He may not disappoint my hope." And he
 rose, and casting into the river the net as far as his arm availed,
 gathered the cords in his hands and waited a full hour, after which he
 pulled at it and, finding it heavy, handled it gently and drew it
 in, little by little, till he got it ashore, when lo and behold! he
 saw in it a one-eyed, lame-legged ape. Seeing this, quoth Khalifah:
 "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah Verily, we
 are Allah's and to Him we are returning! What meaneth this
 heartbreaking, miserable ill luck and hapless fortune? What is come to
 me this blessed day? But all this is of the destinies of Almighty
 Allah!" Then he took the ape and tied him with a cord to a tree
 which grew on the riverbank, and grasping a whip he had with him,
 raised his arm in the air, thinking to bring down the scourge upon the
 quarry, when Allah made the ape speak with a fluent tongue, saying: "O
 Khalifah, hold thy hand and beat me not, but leave me bounden to
 this tree and go down to the river and cast thy net, confiding in
 Allah; for He will give thee thy daily bread."
 </p><p>  Hearing this, Khalifah went down to the river, and casting his
 net, let the cords run out. Then he pulled it in and found it
 heavier than before, so he ceased not to tug at it till he brought
 it to land, when, behold, there was another ape in it, with front
 teeth wide apart, kohl-darkened eyes, and hands stained with henna
 dyes; and he was laughing, and wore a tattered waistcloth about his
 middle. Quoth Khalifah, "Praised be Allah Who hath changed the fish of
 the river into apes!" Then, going up to the first ape, who was still
 tied to the tree, he said to him: "See, O unlucky, how fulsome was the
 counsel thou gavest me! None but thou made me light on this second
 ape; and for that thou gavest me good morrow with thy one eye and
 thy lameness, I am become distressed and weary, without dirham or
 dinar."
 </p><p>  So saying, he hent in hand a stick and flourishing it thrice in
 the air, was about to come down with it upon the lame ape, when the
 creature cried out for mercy and said to him: "I conjure thee, by
 Allah, spare me for the sake of this my fellow, and seek of him thy
 need; for he will guide thee to thy desire!" So he held his hand
 from him, and throwing down the stick, went up to and stood by the
 second ape, who said to him: "O Khalifah, this my speech will profit
 thee naught except thou hearken to what I say to thee; but an thou
 do my bidding and cross me not, I will be the cause of thine
 enrichment." Asked Khalifah, "And what hast thou to say to me that I
 may obey thee therein?" The ape answered, "Leave me bound on the
 bank and hie thee down to the river, then cast thy net a third time,
 and after I will tell thee what to do."
 </p><p>  So he took his net, and going down to the river, cast it once more
 and waited awhile. Then he drew it in, and finding it heavy, labored
 at it and ceased not his travail till he got it ashore, when he
 found in it yet another ape. But this one was red, with a blue
 waistcloth about his middle; his hands and feet were stained with
 henna and his eyes blackened with kohl When Khalifah saw this, he
 exclaimed: "Glory to God the Great! Extolled be the perfection of
 the Lord of Dominion! Verily, this is a blessed day from first to last
 Its ascendant was fortunate in the countenance of the first ape, and
 the scroll is known by its superscription! Verily, today is a day of
 apes. There is not a single fish left in the river, and we are come
 out today but to catch monkeys!"
 </p><p>  Then he turned to the third ape and said, "And what thing thou also,
 O unlucky?" Quoth the ape, "Dost thou not know me, O Khalifah!" and
 quoth he, "Not I!" The ape cried, "I am the ape of Abu al-Sa'adat
 the Jew, the shroff." Asked Khalifah, "And what dost thou for him?"
 and the ape answered, "I give him good morrow at the first of the day,
 and he gaineth five ducats; and again at the end of the day, I give
 him good even, and he gaineth other five ducats." Whereupon Khalifah
 turned to the first ape and said to him: "See, O unlucky, what fine
 apes other folk have! As for thee, thou givest me good morrow with thy
 one eye and thy lameness and thy ill-omened phiz, and I become poor
 and bankrupt and hungry!" So saying, he took the cattle stick, and
 flourishing it thrice in the air, was about to come down with it on
 the first ape, when Abu al-Sa'adat's ape said to him: "Let him be, O
 Khalifah. Hold thy hand and come hither to me, that I may tell thee
 what to do."
 </p><p>  So Khalifah threw down the stick, and walking up to him,'cried, 'And
 what hast thou to say to me, O monarch of all monkeys?" Replied the
 ape: "Leave me and the other two apes here, and take thy not and
 cast it into the river; and whatever cometh up, bring it to me, and
 I will tell thee what shall gladden thee." He replied, "I hear and
 obey," and took the net and gathered it on his shoulder, reciting
 these couplets:
 </p><p>  "When straitened is my breast I will of my Creator pray,
 <br>  Who may and can the heaviest weight lighten in easiest way,
 <br>  For ere man's glance can turn or close his eye by God His grace
 <br>  Waxeth the broken whole and yieldeth jail its prison prey.
 <br>  Therefore with Allah one and all of thy concerns commit,
 <br>  Whose grace and favor men of wit shall nevermore gainsay."
 <br></p><p>  Now when Khalifah had made an end of his verse, he went down to
 the river, and casting his net, waited awhile. After which he drew
 it up and found therein a fine young fish, with a big head, a tail
 like a ladle, and eyes like two gold pieces. When Khalifah saw this
 fish, he rejoiced, for he had never in his life caught its like, so he
 took it, marveling, and carried it to the ape of Abu al-Sa'adat the
 Jew, as 'twere he had gotten possession of the universal world.
 Quoth the ape, "O Khalifah, what wilt thou do with this, and with
 thine ape?" and quoth the fisherman: "I will tell thee, O monarch of
 monkeys, all I am about to do. Know then that first, I will cast about
 to make away with yonder accursed, my ape, and take thee in his stead,
 and give thee every day to eat of whatso thou wilt." Rejoined the ape:
 "Since thou hast made choice of me, I will tell thee how thou shalt do
 wherein, if it please Allah Almighty, shall be the mending of thy
 fortune. Lend thy mind, then, to what I say to thee and 'tis this!
 Take another cord and tie me also to a tree, where leave me and go
 to the midst of the dike and cast thy net into the Tigris. Then
 after waiting awhile, draw it up and thou shalt find therein a fish
 than which thou never sawest a finer in thy whole life. Bring it to me
 and I will tell thee how thou shalt do after this."
 </p><p>  So Khalifah rose forthright, and casting his net into the Tigris,
 drew up a great catfish the bigness of a lamb. Never had he set eyes
 on its like, for it was larger than the first fish. He carried it to
 the ape, who said to him: "Gather thee some green grass and set half
 of it in a basket; lay the fish therein and cover it with the other
 moiety. Then, leaving us here tied, shoulder the basket and betake
 thee to Baghdad. If any bespeak thee or question thee by the way,
 answer him not, but fare on till thou comest to the market street of
 the money-changers, at the upper end whereof thou wilt find the shop
 of Master Abu al-Sa'adat the Jew, Sheikh of the shroffs, and wilt see
 him sitting on a mattress, with a cushion behind him and two collers,
 one for gold and one for silver, before him, while around him stand
 his Mamelukes and Negro slaves and servant lads. Go up to him and
 set the basket before him, saying: 'O Abu al-Sa'adat, verily I went
 out today to fish and cast my net in thy name, and Allah Almighty sent
 me this fish.' He will ask, 'Hast thou shown it to any but me?' and do
 thou answer, 'No, by Allah!' Then will he take it of thee and give
 thee a dinar. Give it him back and he will give thee two dinars; but
 do thou return them also, and so do with everything he may offer thee;
 and take naught from him, though he give thee the fish's weight in
 gold.
 </p><p>  Then will he say to thee, 'Tell me what thou wouldst have, and do
 thou reply, 'By Allah, I will not sell the fish save for two words!'
 He will ask, 'What are they?' And do thou answer, 'Stand up and say,
 "Bear witness, O ye who are present in the market, that I give
 Khalifah the fisherman my ape in exchange for his ape, and that I
 barter for his lot my lot and luck for his luck." This is the price of
 the fish, and I have no need of gold.' If he do this, I will every day
 give thee good morrow and good even, and every day thou shalt gain ten
 dinars of good gold; whilst this one-eyed, lame-legged ape shall daily
 give the Jew good morrow, and Allah shall afflict him every day with
 an avanie which he must needs pay, nor will he cease to be thus
 afflicted till he is reduced to beggary and hath naught. Hearken
 then to my words, so shalt thou prosper and be guided aright."
 </p><p>  Quoth Khalifah: "I accept thy counsel, O monarch of all the monkeys!
 But as for this unlucky, may Allah never bless him! I know not what to
 do with him." Quoth the ape, "Let him go into the water, and let me go
 also." "I hear and obey," answered Khalifah, and unbound the three
 apes, and they went down into the river. Then he took up the
 catfish, which he washed, then laid it in the basket upon some green
 grass, and covered it with other, and lastly, shouldering his load,
 set out with the basket upon his shoulder and ceased not faring till
 he entered the city of Baghdad. And as he threaded the streets the
 folk knew him and cried out to him, saying, "What hast thou there, O
 Khalifah?" But he paid no heed to them and passed on till he came to
 the market street of the money-changers and fared between the shops,
 as the ape had charged him, till he found the Jew seated at the
 upper end, with his servants in attendance upon him, as he were a King
 of the Kings of Khorasan. He knew him at first sight; so he went up to
 him and stood before him, whereupon Abu al-Sa'adat raised his eyes and
 recognizing him, said: "Welcome, O Khalifah! What wantest thou, and
 what is thy need? If any have missaid thee or spited thee, tell me and
 I will go with thee to the Chief of Police, who shall do thee
 justice on him." Replied Khalifah: "Nay, as thy head liveth, O chief
 of the Jews, none hath missaid me. But I went forth this morning to
 the river and, casting my net into the Tigris on thy luck, brought
 up this fish."
 </p><p>  Therewith he opened the basket and threw the fish before the Jew,
 who admired it and said, the Pentateuch and the Ten Commandments, I
 dreamt last night that the Virgin came to me and said, 'Know, O Abu
 al-Sa'adat, that I have sent thee a pretty present!' And doubtless
 'tis this fish." Then he turned to Khalifah and said to him, "By thy
 faith, hath any seen it but I?" Khalifah replied, "No, by Allah, and
 by Abu Bakr the Veridical, none hath seen it save thou, O chief of the
 Jews!" Whereupon the Jew turned to one of his lads and said to him:
 "Come, carry this fish to my house and bid Sa'adah dress it and fry
 and broil it, against I make an end of my business and hie me home."
 And Khalifah said, "Go, O my lad, let the master's wife fry some of it
 and broil the rest." Answered the boy, "I hear and I obey, O my lord,"
 and, taking the fish, went away with it to the house.
 </p><p>  Then the Jew put out his hand and gave Khalifah the fisherman a
 dinar, saying, "Take this for thyself, O Khalifah, and spend it on thy
 family." When Khalifah saw the dinar on his palm, he took it,
 saying, "Laud to the Lord of Dominion!" as if he had never seen
 aught of gold in his life, and went somewhat away. But before he had
 gone far, he was minded of the ape's charge and turning back, threw
 down the ducat, saying: "Take thy gold and give folk back their
 fish! Dost thou make a laughingstock of folk?" The Jew, hearing
 this, thought he was jesting, and offered him two dinars upon the
 other, but Khalifah said: "Give me the fish, and no nonsense. How
 knewest thou I would sell it at this price?" Whereupon the Jew gave
 him two more dinars and said, "Take these five ducats for thy fish and
 leave greed." So Khalifah hent the five dinars in hand and went
 away, rejoicing, and gazing and marveling at the gold and saying:
 "Glory be to God! There is not with the Caliph of Baghdad what is with
 me this day!"
 </p><p>  Then he ceased not faring on till he came to the end of the market
 street, when he remembered the words of the ape and his charge, and
 returning to the Jew, threw him back the gold. Quoth he: "What
 aileth thee, O Khalifah? Dost thou want silver in exchange for
 gold?" Khalifah replied: "I want nor dirhams nor dinars. I only want
 thee to give me back folk's fish." With this the Jew waxed wroth and
 shouted out at him, saying: "O Fisherman, thou bringest me a fish
 not worth a sequin and I give thee five for it, yet art thou not
 content! Art thou Jinn-mad? Tell me for how much thou wilt sell it."
 Answered Khalifah, "I will not sell it for silver nor for gold, only
 for two sayings thou shalt say me."
 </p><p>  When the Jew heard speak of the "two sayings," his eyes sank into
 his head, he breathed hard and ground his teeth for rage, and said
 to him, "O nail paring of the Moslems, wilt thou have me throw off
 my faith for the sake of thy fish, and wilt thou debauch me from my
 religion and stultify my belief and my conviction which I inherited of
 old from my forebears?" Then he cried out to the servants who were
 in waiting and said: "Out on you! Bash me this unlucky rogue's neck
 and bastinado him soundly!" So they came down upon him with blows
 and ceased not beating him till he fell beneath the shop, and the
 Jew said to them, "Leave him and let him rise." Whereupon Khalifah
 jumped up as if naught ailed him, and the Jew said to him: "Tell me
 what price thou asketh for this fish and I will give it thee; for thou
 hast gotten but scant good of us this day." Answered the fisherman,
 "Have no fear for me, O master, because of the beating, for I can
 eat ten donkeys' rations of stick."
 </p><p>  The Jew laughed at his words and said, "Allah upon thee, tell me
 what thou wilt have and by the right of my faith, I will give it
 thee!" The fisherman replied, "Naught from thee will remunerate me for
 this fish save the two words whereof I spake." And the Jew said,
 "Meseemeth thou wouldst have me become a Moslem." Khalifah rejoined:
 "By Allah, O Jew, an thou Islamize, 'twill nor advantage the Moslems
 nor damage the Jews. And in like manner, an thou hold to thy misbelief
 'twill nor damage the Moslems nor advantage the Jews. But what I
 desire of thee is that thou rise to thy feet and say: 'Bear witness
 against me, O people of the market, that I barter my ape for the ape
 of Khalifah the fisherman and my lot in the world for his lot and my
 luck for his luck'." Quoth the Jew, "If this be all thou desirest,
 'twill sit lightly upon me." So he rose without stay or delay and
 standing on his feet, repeated the required words. After which he
 turned to the fisherman and asked him, "Hast thou aught else to ask of
 me?" "No," answered he, and the Jew said, "Go in peace!"
 </p><p>  Hearing this Khalifah sprung to his feet forthright, took up his
 basket and net, and returned straight to the Tigris, where he threw
 his net and pulled it in. He found it heavy and brought it not
 ashore but with travail, when he found it full of fish of all kinds.
 Presently up came a woman with a dish, who gave him a dinar, and he
 gave her fish for it, and after her a eunuch, who also bought a
 dinar's worth of fish, and so forth till he had sold ten dinars'
 worth. And he continued to sell ten dinars' worth of fish daily for
 ten days, till he had gotten a hundred dinars.
 </p><p>  Now Khalifah the fisherman had quarters in the Passage of the
 Merchants, and as he lay one night in his lodging much bemused with
 hashish, he said to himself: "O Khalifah, the folk all know thee for a
 poor fisherman, and now thou hast gotten a hundred golden dinars.
 Needs must the Commander of the Faithful, Harun al-Rashid, hear of
 this from someone, and haply he will be wanting money and will send
 for thee and say to thee: 'I need a sum of money and it hath reached
 me that thou hast an hundred dinars, so do thou lend them to me
 those same.' I shall answer, 'O Commander of the Faithful, I am a poor
 man, and whoso told thee that I had a hundred dinars lied against
 me, for I have naught of this.' Thereupon be will commit me to the
 Chief of Police, saying, 'Strip him of his clothes and torment him
 with the bastinado till he confess and give up the hundred dinars in
 his possession.' Wherefore, meseemeth to provide against this
 predicament, the best thing I can do is to rise forthright and bash
 myself with the whip, so to use myself to beating." And his hashish
 said to him, "Rise, doff thy dress."
 </p><p>  So he stood up, and putting off his clothes, took a whip he had by
 him and set handy a leather pillow. Then he fell to lashing himself,
 laying every other blow upon the pillow and roaring out the while-:
 "Alas! Alas! By Allah, 'tis a false saying, O my lord, and they have
 lied against me, for I am a poor fisherman and have naught of the
 goods of the world!" The noise of the whip falling on the pillow and
 on his person resounded in the still of night and the folk heard it,
 and amongst others the merchants, and they said: "Whatever can ail the
 poor fellow, that he crieth and we hear the noise of blows falling
 on him? 'Twould seem robbers have broken in upon him and are
 tormenting him." Presently they all came forth of their lodgings at.
 the noise of the blows and the crying, and repaired to Khalifah's
 room, but they found the door locked and said one to other: "Belike
 the robbers have come in upon him from the back of the adjoining
 saloon. It behooveth us to climb over by the roofs."
 </p><p>  So they clomb over the roofs, and coming down through the
 skylight, saw him naked and flogging himself, and asked him, "What
 aileth thee, O Khalifah?" He answered: "Know, O folk, that I have
 gained some dinars and fear lest my case be carried up to the Prince
 of True Believers, Harun al-Rashid, and he send for me and demand of
 me those same gold pieces; whereupon I should deny, and I fear that if
 I deny, he will torture me, so I am torturing myself, by way of
 accustoming me to what may come." The merchants laughed at him and
 said: "Leave this fooling. May Allah not bless thee and the dinars
 thou hast gotten! Verily thou hast disturbed us this night and hast
 troubled our hearts."
 </p><p>  So Khalifah left flogging himself and slept till the morning, when
 he rose and would have gone about his business, but bethought him of
 his hundred dinars and said in his mind: "An I leave them at home,
 thieves will steal them, and if I put them in a belt about my waist,
 peradventure someone will see me and lay in wait for me till he come
 upon me in some lonely place and slay me and take the money. But I
 have a device that should serve me well, right well." So he jumped
 up forthright and made him a pocket in the collar of his gabardine,
 and tying the hundred dinars up in a purse, laid them in the collar
 pocket. Then he took his net and basket and staff and went down to the
 Tigris, where he made a cast, but brought up naught. So he removed
 from that place to another and threw again, but once more the net came
 up empty. And he went on removing from place to place till he had gone
 half a day's journey from the city, ever casting the net, which kept
 bringing up naught. So he said to himself, "By Allah, I will throw
 my net a-stream but this once more, whether ill come of it or weal!"
 </p><p>  Then he hurled the net with all his force, of the excess of his
 wrath, and the purse with the hundred dinars flew out of his collar
 pocket and, lighting in midstream, was carried away by the strong
 current. Whereupon he threw down the net, and doffing his clothes,
 left them on the bank and plunged into the water after the purse. He
 dived for it nigh a hundred times, till his strength was exhausted and
 he came up for sheer fatigue, without chancing on it. When he
 despaired of finding the purse, he returned to the shore, where he saw
 nothing but staff, net, and basket and sought for his clothes but
 could light on no trace of them. So he said in himself: "O vilest of
 those wherefor was made the byword: 'The pilgrimage is not perfected
 save by copulation with the camel!"' Then he wrapped the net about
 him, and taking staff in one hand and basket in other, went trotting
 about like a camel in rut, running right and left and backward and
 forward, disheveled and dusty, as he were a rebel Marid let loose from
 Solomon's prison.
 </p><p>  So far for what concerns the fisherman Khalifah; but as regards
 the Caliph Harun al-Rashid, he had a friend, a jeweler called Ibn
 al-Kirnas, and all the traders, brokers, and middlemen knew him for
 the Caliph's merchant. Wherefore there was naught sold in Baghdad by
 way of rarities and things of price or Mamelukes or handmaidens but
 was first shown to him. As he sat one day in his shop, behold, there
 came up to him the Sheikh of the brokers, with a slave girl whose like
 seers never saw, for she was of passing beauty and loveliness,
 symmetry and perfect grace, and among her gifts that she knew all arts
 and sciences and could make verses and play upon all manner musical
 instruments. So Ibn al-Kirnas bought her for five thousand golden
 dinars and clothed her with other thousand. After which he carried her
 to the Prince of True Believers, with whom she lay the night, and
 who made trial of her in every kind of knowledge and accomplishment
 and found her versed in all sorts of arts and sciences, having no
 equal in her time. Her name was Kut al-Kulub and she was even as saith
 the poet:
 </p><p>     I fix my glance on her, whene'er she wends,
 <br>     And nonacceptance of my glance breeds pain.
 <br>     She favors graceful-necked gazelle at gaze,
 <br>     And "Graceful as gazelle" to say we're fain.
 <br></p><p>  On the morrow the Caliph sent for Ibn al-Kirnas, the jeweler, and
 bade him receive ten thousand dinars to her price. And his heart was
 taken up with the slave girl Kut al-Kulub and he forsook the Lady
 Zubaydah bint al-Kasim, for all she was the daughter of his father's
 brother, and he abandoned all his favorite concubines and abode a
 whole month without stirring from Kut al-Kulub's side save to go to
 the Friday prayers and return to her all in haste. This was grievous
 to the lords of the realm and they complained thereof to the Wazir
 Ja'afar the Barmecide, who bore with the Commander of the Faithful and
 waited till the next Friday, when he entered the cathedral mosque and,
 forgathering with the Caliph, related to him all that occurred to
 him of extraordinary stories anent seld-seen love and lovers, with
 intent to draw out what was in his mind.
 </p><p>  Quoth the Caliph, "By Allah, O Ja'afar, this is not of my choice,
 but my heart is caught in the snare of love and wot I not what is to
 be done!" The Wazir Ja'afar replied: "O Commander of the Faithful,
 thou knowest how this girl Kut al-Kulub is become at thy disposal
 and of the number of thy servants, and that which hand possesseth soul
 coveteth not. Moreover, I will tell thee another thing, which is
 that the highest boast of kings and princes is in hunting and the
 pursuit of sport and victory; and if thou apply thyself to this,
 perchance it will divert thee from her, and it may be thou wilt forget
 her." Rejoined the Caliph: "Thou sayest well, O Ja'afar. Come let us
 go a-hunting forthright, without stay or delay." So soon as Friday
 prayers were prayed, they left the mosque, and at once mounting
 their she-mules, rode forth to the chase, occupied with talk, and
 their attendants outwent them.
 </p><p>  Presently the heat became overhot and Al-Rashid said to his Wazir,
 "O Ja'afar, I am sore athirst." Then he looked around, and espying a
 figure in the distance on a high mound, asked Ja'afar, "Seest thou
 what I see?" Answered the Wazir: "Yes; O Commander of the Faithful.
 I see a dim figure on a high mound. Belike he is the keeper of a
 garden or of a cucumber plot, and in whatso wise water will not be
 lacking in his neighborhood," presently adding, "I will go to him
 and fetch thee some." But Al-Rashid said: "My mule is swifter than thy
 mule, so do thou abide here, on account of the troops, whilst I go
 myself to him and get of this person drink and return." So saying,
 he urged his she-mule, which started off like racing wind or railing
 water, and in the twinkling of an eye made the mound, where he found
 the figure he had, seen to be none other than Khalifah the
 fisherman, naked and wrapped in the net.
 </p><p>  And indeed he was horrible to behold, as to and fro he rolled with
 eyes for very redness like cresset gleam and dusty hair in
 disheveled trim, as he were, Ifrit or a lion grim. Al-Rashid saluted
 him and he returned his salutation, but he was wroth, and fires
 might have been lit at his breath. Quoth the Caliph, "O man, hast thou
 any water?" and quote Khalifah: "How, thou, art thou blind, or
 Jinnmad? Get thee to the river Tigris, for 'tis behind this mound." So
 Al-Rashid went around the mound, and going down to the river, drank
 and watered his mule. Then without a moment's delay he returned to
 Khalifah and said to him, "What aileth thee, O man, to stand here, and
 what is thy calling.?" The fisherman cried: "This is a stranger and
 sillier question than that about the water! Seest thou not the gear of
 my craft on my shoulder?" Said the Caliph, "Belike thou art a
 fisherman?" and he replied, "Yes." Asked Al-Rashid, "Where is thy
 gabardine, and where are thy waistcloth and girdle, and where be the
 rest of thy raiment?"
 </p><p>  Now these were the very things which had been taken from Khalifah,
 like for like, so when he heard the Caliph name them, he got into
 his head that it was he who had stolen his clothes from the riverbank,
 and coming down from the top of the mound, swiftlier than the blinding
 levin, laid hold of the mule's bridle, saying, "Hark ye, man, bring me
 back my things and leave jesting and joking." Al-Rashid replied, "By
 Allah, I have not seen thy clothes, nor know aught of them!" Now the
 Caliph had large cheeks and a small mouth, so Khalifah said to him:
 "Belike thou art by trade a singer, or a piper on pipes? But bring
 me back my clothes fairly and without more ado, or I will bash thee
 with this my staff till thou bepiss thyself and befoul thy clothes."
 When Al-Rashid saw the staff in the fisherman's hand and that he had
 the vantage of him, he said to himself, "By Allah, I cannot brook from
 this mad beggar half a blow of that staff!" Now he had on a satin
 gown, so he pulled it off and gave it to Khalifah, saying, "O man,
 take this in place of thy clothes." The fisherman took it and turned
 it about and said, "My clothes are worth ten of this painted aba
 cloak," and rejoined the Caliph, "Put it on till I bring thee thy
 gear."
 </p><p>  So Khalifah donned the gown, but finding it too long for him, took a
 knife he had with him tied to the handle of his basket, and cut off
 nigh a third of the skirt, so that it fell only beneath his knees.
 Then he turned to Al-Rashid and said to him, "Allah upon thee, O
 piper, tell me what wage thou gettest every month from thy master, for
 thy craft of piping." Replied the Caliph, "My wage is ten dinars a
 month," and Khalifah continued: "By Allah, my poor fellow, thou makest
 me sorry for thee! Why, I make thy ten dinars every day! Hast thou a
 mind to take service with me, and I will teach thee the art of fishing
 and share my gain with thee? So shalt thou make five dinars a day
 and be my slavey and I will protect thee against thy master with
 this staff." Quoth Al-Rashid, "I will well," and quoth Khalifah: "Then
 get off thy she-ass and tie her up, so she may serve us to carry the
 fish hereafter, and come hither, that I may teach thee to fish
 forthright."
 </p><p>  So Al-Rashid alighted, and hobbling his mule, tucked his skirts into
 his girdle, and Khalifah said to him, "O piper, lay hold of the net
 thus and put it over thy forearm thus and cast it into the Tigris
 thus." Accordingly the Caliph took heart of grace and, doing as the
 fisherman showed him, threw the net and pulled at it, but could not
 draw it up. So Khalifah came to his aid and tugged at it with him, but
 the two together could not hale it up. Whereupon said the fisherman:
 "O piper of ill-omen, for the first time I took thy gown in place of
 my clothes, but this second time I will have thine ass and will beat
 thee to boot till thou bepiss and beskit thyself, an I find my net
 torn." Quoth Al-Rashid, "Let the twain of us pull at once." So they
 both pulled together, and succeeded with difficulty in hauling that
 net ashore, when they found it full of fish of all kinds and colors,
 and Khalifah said to Al-Rashid: "By Allah, O piper, thou art foul of
 favor but an thou apply thyself to fishing, thou wilt make a mighty
 fine fisherman. But now 'twere best thou bestraddle thine ass and make
 for the market and fetch me a pair of frails, and I will look after
 the fish till thou return, when I and thou will load it on thine ass's
 back. I have scales and weights and all we want, so we can take them
 with us, and thou wilt have nothing to do but to hold the scales and
 punch the price. For here we have fish worth twenty dinars. So be fast
 with the frails and loiter not."
 </p><p>  Answered the Caliph, "I hear and obey" and mounting, left him with
 his fish, and spurred his mule, in high good humor, and ceased not
 laughing over his adventure with the fisherman till he came up to
 Ja'afar, who said to him, "O Commander of the Faithful, belike when
 thou wentest down to drink, thou foundest a pleasant flower garden and
 enteredst and tookest thy pleasure therein alone?" At this Al-Rashid
 fell a laughing again and all the Barmecides rose and kissed the
 ground before him, saying: "O Commander of the Faithful, Allah make
 joy to endure for thee and do away annoy from thee! What was the cause
 of thy delaying when thou faredst to drink, and what hath befallen
 thee?" Quoth the Caliph, "Verily, a right wondrous tale and a joyous
 adventure and a wondrous hath befallen me.
 </p><p>  And he repeated to them what had passed between himself and the
 fisherman and his words, "Thou stolest my clothes!" and how he had
 given him his gown and how he had cut off a part of it, finding it too
 long for him. Said Ja'afar, "By Allah, O Commander of the Faithful,
 I had it in mind to beg the gown of thee, but now I will go straight
 to the fisherman and buy it of him." The Caliph replied, "By Allah, he
 hath cut off a third part of the skirt and spoilt it! But, O
 Ja'afar, I am tired with fishing in the river, for I have caught great
 store of fish, which I left on the bank with my master Khalifah, and
 he is watching them and waiting for me to return to him with a
 couple of frails and a matchet. Then we are to go, I and he, to the
 market and sell the fish and share the price." Ja'afar rejoined, "O
 Commander of the Faithful, I will bring you a purchaser for your
 fish." And Al-Rashid retorted: "O Ja'afar, by the virtue of my holy
 forefathers, whoso bringeth me one of the fish that are before
 Khalifah, who taught me angling, I will give him for it a gold dinar!"
 So the crier proclaimed among the troops that they should go forth and
 buy fish for the Caliph, and they all arose and made for the
 riverside.
 </p><p>  Now while Khalifah was expecting the Caliph's return with the two
 frails, behold, the Mamelukes swooped down upon him like vultures
 and took the fish and wrapped them in gold-embroidered kerchiefs,
 beating one another in their eagerness to get at the fisherman
 Whereupon quoth Khalifah, "Doubtless these are the fish of
 Paradise!" and hending two fish right hand and left, plunged into
 the water up to his neck and fell a-saying, "O Allah, by the virtue of
 these fish, let Thy servant the piper, my partner, came to me at
 this very moment." And suddenly up to him came a black slave which was
 the chief of the Caliph's Negro eunuchs. He had tarried behind the
 rest, by reason of his horse having stopped to make water by the way,
 and finding that naught remained of the fish, little or much, looked
 right and left till he espied Khalifah standing in the stream with a
 fish in either hand, and said to him, "Come hither, O Fisherman!"
 But Khalifah replied, "Begone and none of your impudence!" So the
 eunuch went up to him and said, "Give me the fish and I will pay
 thee their price." Replied the fisherman: "Art thou little of wit? I
 will not sell them." Therewith the eunuch drew his mace upon him,
 and Khalifah cried out, saying: "Strike not, O loon! Better largess
 than the mace."
 </p><p>  So saying, he threw the two fishes to the eunuch, who took them
 and laid them in his kerchief. Then he put hand in pouch, but found
 not a single dirham, and said to Khalifah: "O fisherman, verily thou
 art out of luck for, by Allah, I have not a silver about me! But
 come tomorrow to the palace of the Caliphate and ask for the eunuch
 Sandal, whereupon the castratos will direct thee to me, and by
 coming thither thou shalt get what falleth to thy lot and therewith
 wend thy ways." Quoth Khalifah, "Indeed, this is a blessed day, and
 its blessedness was manifest from the first of it!"
 </p><p>  Then he shouldered his net and returned to Baghdad, and as he passed
 through the streets, the folk saw the Caliph's gown on him and
 stared at him till he came to the gate of his quarter, by which was
 the shop of the Caliph's tailor. When the man saw him wearing dress of
 the apparel of the Caliph, worth a thousand dinars, he said to him, "O
 Khalifah, whence hadst thou that gown?" Replied the fisherman: "What
 aileth thee to be impudent? I had it of one whom I taught to fish
 and who is become my apprentice. I forgave him the cutting off of
 his hand for that he stole my clothes and gave me this cape in their
 place." So the tailor knew that the Caliph had come upon him as he was
 fishing and jested with him and given him the gown.
 </p><p>  Such was his case, but as regards Harun al-Rashid, he had gone out
 a-hunting and a-fishing only to divert his thoughts from the damsel
 Kut al-Kulub. But when Zubaydah heard of her and of the Caliph's
 devotion to her, the lady was fired with the jealousy which the more
 especially fireth women, so that she refused meat and drink and
 rejected the delights of sleep, and awaited the Caliph's going forth
 on a journey or what not, that she might set a snare for the damsel.
 So when she learnt that he was gone hunting and fishing, she bade
 her women furnish the palace fairly and decorate it splendidly and
 serve up viands and confections. And amongst the rest she made a China
 dish of the daintiest sweetmeats that can be made, wherein she had put
 bhang.
 </p><p>  Then she ordered one of her eunuchs go to the damsel Kut al-Kulub
 and bid her to the banquet, saying: "The Lady Zubaydah bint alKasim,
 the wife of the Commander of the Faithful, hath drunken medicine
 today, and having heard tell of the sweetness of thy singing,
 longeth to divert herself with somewhat of thine art." Kut al-Kulub
 replied, "Hearing and obedience are due to Allah and the Lady
 Zubaydah," and rose without stay or delay, unknowing what was hidden
 for her in the secret purpose. Then she took with her what instruments
 she needed and, accompanying the eunuch, ceased not faring till she
 stood in the presence of the Princess. When she entered she kissed the
 ground before her again and again, then rising to her feet, said:
 "Peace be on the Lady of the exalted seat and the presence whereto
 none may avail, daughter of the house Abbasi and scion of the
 Prophet's family! May Allah fulfill thee of peace and prosperity in
 the days and the years!"
 </p><p>  Then she stood with the rest of the women and eunuchs, and presently
 the Lady Zubaydah raised her eyes and considered her beauty and
 loveliness. She saw a damsel with cheeks smooth as rose and breasts
 like granado, a face moon-bright, a brow flower-white, and great
 eyes black as night. Her eyelids were languor-dight and her face
 beamed with light, as if the sun from her forehead arose and the murks
 of the night from the locks of her brow. And the fragrance of musk
 from her breath strayed, and flowers bloomed in her lovely face
 inlaid. The moon beamed from her forehead and in her slender shape the
 branches swayed. She was like the full moon shining in the nightly
 shade. Her eyes wantoned, her eyebrows were like a bow arched, and her
 lips of coral molded. Her beauty amazed all who espied her and her
 glances amated all who eyed her. Glory be to Him Who formed her and
 fashioned her and perfected her!
 </p><p>  Quoth the Lady Zubaydah: "Well come, and welcome and fair cheer to
 thee, O Kut al-Kulub! Sit and divert us with thine art and the
 goodliness of thine accomplishments." Quoth the damsel, "I hear and
 I obey," and rose and exhibited tricks of sleight of hand and
 legerdemain and all manner pleasing arts, till the Princess came
 near to fall in love with her and said to herself, "Verily, my
 cousin Al-Rashid is not to blame for loving her!" Then the damsel
 kissed ground before Zubaydah and sat down, whereupon they set food
 before her. Presently they brought her the drugged dish of
 sweetmeats and she ate thereof, and hardly had it settled in her
 stomach when her head fell backward and she sank on the ground
 sleeping. With this, the lady said to her women, "Carry her up to
 one of the chambers, till I summon her," and they replied, "We hear
 and we obey. Then said she to one of her eunuchs, "Fashion me a
 chest and bring it hitherto to me!" And shortly afterward she bade
 make the semblance of a tomb and spread the report that Kut al-Kulub
 had choked and died, threatening her familiars that she would smite
 the neck of whoever should say, "She is alive."
 </p><p>  Now, behold, the Caliph suddenly returned from the chase, and the
 first inquiry he made was for the damsel. So there came to him one
 of his eunuchs, whom the Lady Zubaydah had charged to declare she
 was dead if the Caliph should ask for her and, kissing ground before
 him, said: "May thy head live, O my lord! Be certified that Kut
 al-Kulub choked in eating and is dead." Whereupon cried Al-Rashid,
 "God never gladden thee with good news, O thou bad slave!" and entered
 the palace, where he heard of her death from everyone and asked,
 "Where is her tomb?" So they brought him to the sepulcher and showed
 him the pretended tomb, saying, "This is her burial place." The
 Caliph, weeping sore for her, abode by the tomb a full hour, after
 which he arose and went away, in the utmost distress and the deepest
 melancholy.
 </p><p>  So the Lady Zubaydah saw that her plot had succeeded, and forthright
 sent for the eunuch and said, "Hither with the chest!" He set it
 before her, when she bade bring the damsel, and locking her up
 therein, said to the eunuch: "Take all pains to sell this chest, and
 make it a condition with the purchaser that he buy it locked. Then
 give alms with its price." So he took it and went forth to do her
 bidding.
 </p><p>  Thus fared it with these, but as for Khalifah the fisherman, when
 morning morrowed and shone with its light and sheen, he said to
 himself, "I cannot do aught better today than visit the eunuch who
 bought the fish of me, for he appointed me to come to him in the
 palace of the Caliphate." So he went forth of his lodging, intending
 for the palace, and when he came thither, he found Mamelukes, Negro
 slaves, and eunuchs standing and sitting, and looking at them, behold,
 seated amongst them was the eunuch who had taken the fish of him, with
 the white slaves waiting on him. Presently, one of the Mameluke lads
 called out to him, whereupon the eunuch turned to see who he was and
 lo! it was the fisherman. Now when Khalifah was ware that he saw him
 and recognized him, he said to him: "I have not failed thee, O my
 little Tulip! On this wise are men of their word." Hearing his
 address, Sandal the eunuch laughed and replied, "By Allah, thou art
 right, O Fisherman," and put his hand to his pouch, to give him
 somewhat. But at that moment there arose a great clamor. So he
 raised his head to see what was to do, and finding that it was the
 Wazir Ja'afar the Barmecide coming forth from the Caliph's presence,
 he rose to him and forewent him, and they walked about conversing
 for a longsome time.
 </p><p>  Khalifah the fisherman waited awhile, then, growing weary of
 standing, and finding that the eunuch took no heed of him, he set
 himself in his way and beckoned to him from afar, saying, "O my lord
 Tulip, give me my due and let me go!" The eunuch heard him, but was
 ashamed to answer him because of the Minister's presence, so he went
 on talking with Ja'afar and took no notice whatever of the
 fisherman. Whereupon quoth Khalifah: "O slow o' pay! May Allah put
 to shame all churls and all who take folk's goods and are niggardly
 with them! I put myself under thy protection, O my lord Bran-belly, to
 give me my due and let me go!" The eunuch heard him, but was ashamed
 to answer him before Ja'afar, and the Minister saw the fisherman
 beckoning and talking to him, though he knew not what he was saying.
 So he said to Sandal, misliking his behavior, "O Eunuch, what would
 yonder beggar with thee?" Sandal replied, "Dost thou not know him, O
 my lord the Wazir?" and Ja'afar answered: "By Allah I know him not!
 How should I know a man I have never seen but at this moment?"
 </p><p>  Rejoined the Eunuch: "O my lord, this is the fisherman whose fish we
 seized on the banks of the Tigris. I came too late to get any and
 was ashamed to return to the Prince of True Believers emptyhanded when
 all the Mamelukes had some. Presently I espied the fisherman
 standing in midstream, calling on Allah, with four fishes in his
 hands, and said to him, 'Give me what thou hast there and take their
 worth.' He handed me the fish and I put my hand into my pocket,
 purposing to gift him with somewhat, but found naught therein and
 said, 'Come to me in the palace, and I will give thee wherewithal to
 aid thee in thy poverty.' So he came to me today and I was putting
 hand to pouch, that I might give him somewhat, when thou camest
 forth and I rose to wait on thee and was diverted with thee from
 him, till he grew tired of waiting. And this is the whole story how he
 cometh to be standing here."
 </p><p>  The Wazir, hearing this account, smiled and said: "O Eunuch, how
 is it that this fisherman cometh in his hour of need and thou
 satisfiest him not? Dost thou not know him, O chief of the eunuchs?"
 "No," answered Sandal, and Ja'afar said. "This is the master of the
 Commander of the Faithful, and his partner and our lord the Caliph
 hath arisen this morning strait of breast, heavy of heart, and
 troubled in thought, nor is there aught will broaden his breast save
 this fisherman. So let him not go till I crave the Caliph's pleasure
 concerning him and bring him before him. Perchance Allah will
 relieve him of his oppression and console him for the loss of Kut
 al-Kulub by means of the fisherman's presence, and he will give him
 wherewithal to? better himself, and thou wilt be the cause of this."
 Replied Sandal: "O my lord, do as thou wilt, and may Allah Almighty
 long continue thee a pillar of the dynasty of the Commander of the
 Faithful, whose shadow Allah perpetuate and prosper it, root and
 branch!"
 </p><p>  Then the Wazir Ja'afar rose up and went in to the Caliph, and Sandal
 ordered the Mamelukes not to leave the fisherman, whereupon Khalifah
 cried: "How goodly is thy bounty, O Tulip! The seeker is become the
 sought. I come to seek my due, and they imprison me for debts in
 arrears!" When Ja'afar came into the presence of the Caliph, he
 found him sitting with his head bowed earthward, breast straitened and
 mind melancholy, humming the verses of the poet:
 </p><p>  My blamers instant bid that I for her become consoled,
 <br>  But I, what can I do, whose heart declines to be controlled?
 <br>  And how can I in patience bear the loss of lovely maid
 <br>  When fails me patience for a love that holds with firmest hold!
 <br>  Ne'er I'll forget her nor the bowl that 'twixt us both went round
 <br>  And wine of glances maddened me with drunkenness ensouled.
 <br></p><p>  Whenas Ja'afar stood in the presence, he said: "Peace be upon
 thee, O Commander of the Faithful, Defender of the honor of the
 Faith and descendant of the uncle of the Prince of the Apostles, Allah
 assain him and save him and his family one and an!" The Caliph
 raised his head and answered, "And on thee be. peace and the mercy
 of Allah and His blessings!" Quoth Ja'afar, "With leave of the
 Prince of True Believers, his servant would speak without
 restraint." Asked the Caliph: "And when was restraint put upon thee in
 speech, and thou the Prince of Wazirs? Say what thou wilt." Answered
 Ja'afar: "When I went out, O my lord, from before thee, intending
 for my house, I saw standing at the door thy master and teacher and
 partner, Khalifah the fisherman, who was aggrieved at thee and
 complained of thee, saying: 'Glory be to God! I taught him to fish and
 he went away to fetch me a pair of frails, but never came back. And
 this is not the way of a good partner or of a good apprentice.' So, if
 thou hast a mind to partnership, well and good; and if not, tell
 him, that he may take to partner another."
 </p><p>  Now when the Caliph heard these words, he smiled and his
 straitness of breast was done away with and he said, "My life on thee,
 is this the truth thou sayest, that the fisherman standeth at the
 door?" and Ja'afar replied, "By thy life, O Commander of the Faithful,
 he standeth at the door." Quoth the Caliph: "O Ja'afar, by Allah, I
 will assuredly do my best to give him his due! If Allah at my hands
 send him misery, he shall have it, and if prosperity, he shall have
 it." Then he took a piece of paper, and cutting it in pieces, said
 to the Wazir: "O Ja'afar, write down with thine own hand twenty sums
 of money, from one dinar to a thousand, and the names of all kinds
 of offices and dignities from the least appointment to the
 Caliphate; also twenty kinds of punishment, from the hightest
 beating to death." "I hear and I obey, O Commander of the Faithful,"
 answered Ja'afar, and did as he was bidden.
 </p><p>  Then said the Caliph: "O Ja'afar, I swear by my holy forefathers and
 by my kinship to Hamzah and Akil, that I mean to summon the
 fisherman and bid him take one of these papers, whose contents none
 knoweth save thou and I. And whatsoever is written in the paper
 which he shall choose, I will give it to him. Though it be the
 Caliphate, I will divest myself thereof and invest him therewith and
 grudge it not to him. And on the other hand, if there be written
 therein hanging or mutilation or death, I will execute it upon him.
 Now go and fetch him to me." When Ja'afar heard this, he said to
 himself: "There is no Majesty and there is no Might save in Allah, the
 Glorious, the Great' It may be somewhat will fall to this poor
 wretch's lot that will bring about his destruction and I shall be
 the cause. But the Caliph hath sworn, so nothing remains now but to
 bring him in, and naught will happen save whatso Allah willeth."
 Accordingly he went out to Khalifah the fisherman and laid hold of his
 hand, to carry him in to the Caliph, whereupon his reason fled and
 he said in himself: "What a stupid I was to come after yonder
 ill-omened slave, Tulip, whereby he hath brought me in company with
 Bran-belly!" Ja'afar fared on with him, with Mamelukes before and
 behind, whilst he said, "Doth not arrest suffice, but these must go
 behind and before me, to hinder my making off?" till they had
 traversed seven vestibules, when the Wazir said to him: "Mark my
 words, O Fisherman! Thou standest before the Commander of the Faithful
 and Defender of the Faith!"
 </p><p>  Then he raised the great curtain and Khalifah's eyes fell on the
 Caliph, who was seated on his couch, with the lords of the realm
 standing in attendance upon him. As soon as he knew him, he went up to
 him and said: "Well come, and welcome to thee, O piper! 'Twas not
 right of thee to make thyself a fisherman and go away, leaving me
 sitting to guard the fish, and never to return! For, before I was
 aware, there came up Mamelukes on beasts of all manner colors, and
 snatched away the fish from me, I standing alone. And this was all
 of thy fault, for hadst thou returned with the frails forthright, we
 had sold a hundred dinars' worth of fish. And now I come to seek my
 due, and they have arrested me. But thou, who hath imprisoned thee
 also in this place?" The Caliph smiled, and raising a corner of the
 curtain, put forth his head and said to the fisherman, "Come hither
 and take thee one of these papers." Quoth Khalifah the fisherman:
 "Yesterday thou wast a fisherman, and today thou hast become an
 astrologer, but the more trades a man hath, the poorer he waxeth."
 Thereupon Ja'afar said: "Take the paper at once, and do as the
 Commander of the Faithful biddeth thee, without prating."
 </p><p>  So he came forward and put forth his hand saying, "Far be it from me
 that this piper should ever again be my knave and fish with me!" Then,
 taking the paper, he handed it to the Caliph, saying: "O piper, what
 hath come out for me therein? Hide naught thereof." So Al-Rashid
 received it and passed it on to Ja'afar and said to him, "Read what is
 therein." He looked at it and said, "There is no Majesty and there
 is no Might save in Allah, the Glorious, the Great!" Said the
 Caliph: "Good news, O Ja'afar? What seest thou therein?" Answered
 the Wazir: "O Commander of the Faithful there came up from the
 paper, 'Let the Fisherman receive a hundred blows with a stick.'" So
 the Caliph commanded to beat the Fisherman and they gave him a hundred
 sticks, after which he rose, saying: "Allah damn this, O Branbelly!
 Are jail and sticks part of the game?"
 </p><p>  Then said Ja'afar: " O Commander of the Faithful, this poor devil is
 come to the river, and how shall he go away thirsting? We hope that
 among the alms deeds of the Commander of the Faithful he may have
 leave to take another paper, so haply somewhat may come out
 wherewithal he may succor his poverty." Said the Caliph: "By Allah,
 O Ja'afar, if he take another paper and death be written therein, I
 will assuredly kill him, and thou wilt be the cause." Answered
 Ja'afar, "If he die he will be at rest." But Khalifah the fisherman
 said to him: "Allah ne'er, gladden thee with good news! Have I made
 Baghdad strait upon you, that ye seek to slay me?" Quoth Ja'afar,
 "Take thee a paper, and crave the blessing of Allah Almighty!"
 </p><p>  So he put out his hand, and taking a paper, gave it to Ja'afar,
 who read it and was silent. The Caliph asked, "Why art thou silent,
 O son of Yahya?" and he answered: "O Commander of the Faithful,
 there hath come out on this paper, 'Naught shall be given to the
 fisherman."' Then said the Caliph: "His daily bread will not come from
 us. Bid him fare forth from before our face." Quoth Ja'afar: "By the
 claims of thy pious forefathers, let him take a third paper. It may be
 it will bring him alimony," and quoth the Caliph, "Let him take one
 and no more."
 </p><p>  So he put out his hand and took a third paper, and behold, therein
 was written, "Let the Fisherman be given one dinar." Ja'afar cried
 to him, "I sought good fortune for thee, but Allah willed not to
 thee aught save this dinar." And Khalifah answered: "Verily, a dinar
 for every hundred sticks were rare good luck. May Allah not send thy
 body health!" The Caliph laughed at him and Ja'afar took him by the
 hand and led him out. When he reached the door, Sandal the eunuch
 saw him and said to him: "Hither, O Fisherman! Give us portion of that
 which the Commander of the Faithful hath bestowed on thee whilst
 jesting with thee." Replied Khalifah: "By Allah, O Tulip, thou art
 right! Wilt thou share with me, O nigger? Indeed, I have eaten stick
 to the tune of a hundred blows and have earned one dinar, and thou art
 but too welcome to it." So saying, he threw him the dinar and went
 out, with the tears flowing down the plain of his cheeks.
 </p><p>  When the eunuch saw him in this plight, he knew that he had spoken
 sooth and called to the lads to fetch him back. So they brought him
 back and Sandal, putting his hand to his pouch, pulled out a red
 purse, whence he emptied a hundred golden dinars into the
 fisherman's hand, saying, "Take this gold in payment of thy fish,
 and wend thy ways." So Khalifah, in high good humor, took the
 hundred ducats and the Caliph's one dinar and went his way, and forgot
 the beating.
 </p><p>  Now as Allah willed it for the furthering of that which He had
 decreed, he passed by the mart of the handmaidens, and seeing there
 a mighty ring where many folks were forgathering, said to himself,
 "What is this crowd?" So he brake through the merchants and others,
 who said, "Make wide the way for Skipper Rapscallion, and let him
 pass." Then he looked, and behold, he saw a chest, with a eunuch
 seated thereon and an old man standing by it,-and the Sheikh was
 crying: "O merchants, O men of money, who will hasten and hazard his
 coin for this chest of unknown contents from the palace of the Lady
 Zubaydah bint al-Kasim, wife of the Commander of the Faithful? How
 much shall I say for you? Allah bless you all!" Quoth one of the
 merchants; "By Allah, this is a risk! But I will say one word, and
 no blame to me. Be it mine for twenty dinars." Quoth another, "Fifty,"
 and they went on bidding, one against other, till the price reached
 a hundred ducats.
 </p><p>  Then said the crier, "Will any of you bid more, O merchants?" And
 Khalifah the fisherman said, "Be it mine for a hundred dinars and
 one dinar." The merchants, hearing these words, thought he was jesting
 and laughed at him, saying, "O Eunuch, sell it to Khalifah for a
 hundred dinars and one dinar!" Quoth the eunuch: "By Allah, I will
 sell it to none but him! Take it, O Fisherman. The Lord bless thee
 in it, and here with thy gold." So Khalifah pulled out the ducats
 and gave them to the eunuch, who, the bargain being duly made,
 delivered to him the chest and bestowed the price in alms on the spot,
 after which he returned to the palace and acquainted the Lady Zubaydah
 with what he had done, whereat she rejoiced. Meanwhile the fisherman
 hove the chest on shoulder, but could not carry it on this wise for
 the excess of its weight, so he lifted it onto his head and thus
 bore it to the quarter where he lived. Here he set it down, and
 being weary, sat awhile bemusing what had befallen him and saying in
 himself, "Would Heaven I knew what is in this chest!"
 </p><p>  Then he opened the door of his lodging and haled the chest till he
 got it into his closet, after which he strove to open it, but
 failed. Quoth he: "What folly possessed me to buy this chest? There is
 no help for it but to break it open and see what is herein." So he
 applied himself to the lock, but could not open it, and said to
 himself, "I will leave it till tomorrow." Then he would have stretched
 him out to sleep, but could find no room, for the chest filled the
 whole closet. So he got upon it and lay him down. But when he had lain
 awhile, behold, he felt something stir under him, whereat sleep
 forsook him and his reason fled. So he arose and cried: "Meseems there
 be Jinns in the chest. Praise to Allah Who suffered me not to open it!
 For had I done so, they had risen against me in the dark and slain me,
 and from them would have befallen me naught of good."
 </p><p>  Then he lay down again, when lo! the chest moved a second time, more
 than before, whereupon he sprang to his feet and said: "There it
 goes again. But this is terrible!" And he hastened to look for the
 lamp, but could not find it and had not the wherewithal to buy
 another. So he went forth and cried out, "Ho, people of the
 quarter!" Now the most part of the folk were asleep, but they awoke at
 his crying and asked, "What aileth thee, O Khalifah?" He answered,
 "Bring me a lamp, for the Jinn are upon me." They laughed at him and
 gave him a lamp, wherewith he returned to his closet. Then he smote
 the lock of the chest with a stone and broke it, and opening it, saw a
 damsel like a houri lying asleep within. Now she had been drugged with
 bhang, but at that moment she threw up the stuff and awoke. Then she
 opened her eyes, and feeling herself confined and cramped, moved.
 At this sight quoth Khalifah, "By Allah, O my lady, whence art
 thou?" and quoth she, "Bring me jessamine, and narcissus." And
 Khalifah answered, "There is naught here but henna flowers."
 </p><p>  Thereupon she came to herself, and considering Khalifah, said to
 him, "What art thou?" presently adding, "And where am I?" He said,
 "Thou art in my lodging." Asked she, "Am I not in the palace of the
 Caliph Harun al-Rashid?" And quoth he: "What manner of thing is
 Al-Rashid? O madwoman, Thou art naught but my slave girl. I bought
 thee this very day for a hundred dinars and one dinar, and brought
 thee home, and thou wast asleep in this here chest." When she heard
 these words she said to him, "What is thy name?" Said he: "My name
 is Khalifah. How comes my star to have grown propitious, when I know
 my ascendant to have been otherwise?" She laughed and cried: "Spare me
 this talk! Hast thou anything to eat?" Replied he: "No, by Allah,
 nor yet to drink! I have not eaten these two days, and am now in
 want of a morsel." She asked, "Hast thou no money?" and he said:
 "Allah keep this chest which hath beggared me. I gave all I had for it
 and am become bankrupt."
 </p><p>  The damsel laughed at him and said: "Up with thee and seek of thy
 neighbors somewhat for me to eat, for I am hungry." So he went forth
 and cried out, "Ho, people of the quarter!" Now the folk were
 asleep, but they awoke and asked, "What aileth thee, O Khalifah?"
 Answered he, "O my neighbors, I am hungry and have nothing to eat." So
 one came down to him with a bannock and another with broken meats
 and a third with a bittock of cheese and a fourth with a cucumber, and
 so on till his lap was full and he returned to his closet and laid the
 whole between her hands, saying, "Eat." But she laughed at him,
 saying: "How can I eat of this when I have not a mug of water
 whereof to drink? I fear to choke with a mouthful and die." Quoth
 he, "I will fill thee this pitcher." So he took the pitcher, and going
 forth, stood 'm the midst of the street and cried out, saying, "Ho,
 people of the quarter!" Quoth they, "What calamity is upon thee
 tonight, O Khalifah!" And he said, "Ye gave me food and I ate, but now
 I am athirst, so give me to drink."
 </p><p>  Thereupon one came down to him with a mug and another with an ewer
 and a third with a gugglet, and he filled his pitcher, and bearing
 it back, said to the damsel, "O my lady, thou lackest nothing now."
 Answered she, "True, I want nothing more at this present." Quoth he,
 "Speak to me and say me thy story." And quoth she: "Fie upon thee!
 An thou knowest me not, I will tell thee who I am. I am Kut al-Kulub,
 the Caliph's handmaiden, and the Lady Zubaydah was jealous of me, so
 she drugged me with bhang and set me in this chest," presently adding:
 "Alhamdolillah- praised be God- for that the matter hath come to easy
 issue and no worse! But this befell me not save for thy good luck, for
 thou wilt certainly get of the Caliph Al-Rashid money galore, that
 will be the means of thine enrichment." Quoth Khalifah, "Is not
 Al-Rashid he in whose palace I was imprisoned?" "Yes," answered she,
 and he said: "By Allah, never saw I more niggardly wight than he, that
 piper little of good and wit! He gave me a hundred blows with a
 stick yesterday and but one dinar, for all I taught him to fish and
 made him my partner, but he played me false." Replied she: "Leave this
 unseemly talk, and open thine eyes and look thou bear thyself
 respectfully whenas thou seest him after this, and thou shalt win
 thy wish."
 </p><p>  When he heard her words, it was if he had been asleep and awoke, and
 Allah removed the veil from his judgment, because of his good luck,
 and he answered, "O my head and eyes!" Then said he to her, "Sleep, in
 the name of Allah." So she lay down and fell asleep (and he afar
 from her) till the morning, when she sought of him ink case and paper,
 and when they were brought, wrote to Ibn al-Kirnas, the Caliph's
 friend, acquainting him with her case and how at the end of all that
 had befallen her she was with Khalifah the fisherman, who had bought
 her. Then she gave him the scroll, saying-"Take this and hie thee to
 the jewel market and ask for the shop of Ibn al-Kirnas the Jeweler and
 give him this paper, and speak not." "I hear and I obey," answered
 Khalifah, and going with the scroll to the market, inquired for the
 shop of Ibn al-Kirnas. They directed him thither, and on entering it
 he saluted the merchant, who returned his salaam with contempt and
 said to him, "What dost thou want?" Thereupon he gave him the letter
 and he took it, but read it not, thinking the fisherman a beggar who
 sought an alms of him, and said to one of his lads, "Give him half a
 dirham." Quoth Khalifah: "I want no alms. Read the paper."
 </p><p>  So Ibn al-Kirnas took the letter and read it, and no sooner knew its
 import than he kissed it and laid it on his head. Then he arose and
 said to Khalifah, "O my brother, where is thy house?" Asked
 Khalifah: "What wantest thou with my house? Wilt thou go thither and
 steal my slave girl?" Then Ibn al-Kirnas answered: "Not so. On the
 contrary, I will buy thee somewhat whereof you may eat, thou and she."
 So he said, "My house is in such a quarter," and the merchant
 rejoined: "Thou hast done well. May Allah not give thee health, O
 unlucky one!" Then he called out to two of his slaves and said to
 them: "Carry this man to the shop of Mohsin the shroff and say to him,
 'O Mohsin, give this man a thousand dinars of gold,' then bring him
 back to me in haste."
 </p><p>  So they carried him to the money-changer, who paid him the money,
 and returned with him to their master, whom they found mounted on a
 dapple she-mule worth a thousand dinars, with Mamelukes and pages
 about him, and by his side another mule like his own, saddled and
 bridled. Quoth the jeweler to Khalifah, "Bismillah, mount this
 mule." Replied he, "I won't, for by Allah, I fear she throw me," and
 quoth Ibn al-Kirnas, "By God, needs must thou mount." So he came up,
 and mounting her, face to crupper, caught hold of her tail and cried
 out, whereupon she threw him on the ground and they laughed at him.
 But he rose and said, "Did I not tell thee I would not mount this
 great jenny-ass?" Thereupon Ibn al-Kirnas left him in the market,
 and repairing to the Caliph, told him of the damsel, after which he
 returned and removed her to his own house.
 </p><p>  Meanwhile Khalifah went home to look after the handmaid and found
 the people of the quarter forgathering and saying: "Verily, Khalifah
 is today in a terrible pickle! Would we knew whence he can have gotten
 this damsel!" Quoth one of them: "He is a mad pimp. Haply he found her
 lying on the road drunken, and carried her to his own house, and his
 absence showeth that he knoweth his offense." As they were talking,
 behold, up came Khalifah, and they said to him: "What a plight is
 thine, O unhappy! Knowest thou not what is come to thee?" He
 replied, "No, by Allah!" and they said: "But just now there came
 Mamelukes and took away thy slave girl whom thou stolest, and sought
 for thee, but found thee not." Asked Khalifah, "And how came they to
 take my slave girl?" and quoth one, "Had he fallen in their way,
 they had slain him."
 </p><p>  But he, so far from heeding them, returned running to the shop of
 Ibn al-Kirnas, whom he met riding, and said to him: "By Allah, 'twas
 not right of thee to wheedle me and meanwhile send thy Mamelukes to
 take my slave girl!" Replied the jeweler, "O idiot, come with me,
 and hold thy tongue." So he took him and carried him into a house
 handsomely builded, where he found the damsel seated on a couch of
 gold, with ten slave girls like moons round her. Sighting her, Ibn
 al-Kirnas kissed ground before her, and she said, "What hast thou done
 with my new master, who bought me with all he owned?" He replied, "O
 my lady, I gave him a thousand golden dinars,' and related to her
 Khalifah's history from first to last, whereat she laughed and said:
 "Blame him not, for he is but a common wight. These other thousand
 dinars are a gift from me to him, and Almighty Allah willing, he shall
 win of the Caliph what shall enrich him."
 </p><p>  As they were talking, there came a eunuch from the Commander of
 the Faithful in quest of Kut al-Kulub, for when he knew that she was
 in the house of Ibn al-Kirnas, he could not endure, the severance, but
 bade bring her forthwith. So she repaired to the Palace, taking
 Khalifah with her, and going into the presence, kissed ground before
 the Caliph, who rose to her, saluting and welcoming her, and asked her
 how she had fared with him who had brought her. She replied: "He is
 a man, Khalifah the fisherman hight, and there he standeth at the
 door. He telleth me that he hath an account to settle with the
 Commander of the Faithful, by reason of a partnership between him
 and the Caliph in fishing." Asked Al-Rashid, "Is he at the door?"
 and she answered, "Yes." So the Caliph sent for him and he kissed
 ground before him and wished him endurance of glory and prosperity.
 The Caliph marveled at him and laughed at him, and said to him, "O
 Fisherman, wast thou in very deed my partner yesterday?" Khalifah took
 his meaning, and heartening his heart and summoning spirit, replied:
 "By Him who bestowed upon thee the succession to thy cousin, I know
 her not in anywise and have had no commerce with her save by way of
 sight and speech!"
 </p><p>  Then he repeated to him all that had befallen him since he last
 saw him, whereat the Caliph laughed and his breast broadened and he
 said to Khalifah, "Ask of us what thou wilt, O thou who bringest to
 owners their own!" But he was silent, so the Caliph ordered him
 fifty thousand dinars of gold and a costly dress of honor such as
 great sovereigns don, and a she-mule, and gave him black slaves of the
 Sudan to serve him, so that he became as he were one of the kings of
 that time. The Caliph was rejoiced at the recovery of his favorite and
 knew that all this was the doing of his cousin-wife, the Lady
 Zubaydah, wherefore he, was sore enraged against her and held aloof
 from her a great while, visiting her not, neither inclining to
 pardon her. When she was certified of this, she was sore concerned for
 his wrath, and her face, that was wont to be rosy, waxed pale and
 wan till, when her patience was exhausted, she sent a letter to her
 cousin, the Commander of the Faithful, making her excuses to him and
 confessing her offenses, and ending with these verses:
 </p><p>  I long once more the love that was between us to regain,
 <br>  That I may quench the fire of grief and bate the force of bane.
 <br>  O lord of me, have ruth upon the stress my passion deals,
 <br>  Enough to me is what you doled of sorrow and of pain.
 <br>  'Tis life to me an deign you keep the troth you deigned to plight,
 <br>  'Tis death to me an troth you break and fondest vows profane.
 <br>  Given I've sinned a sorry sin, yet grant me ruth, for naught,
 <br>  By Allah, sweeter is than friend who is of pardon fain.
 <br></p><p>When the Lady Zubaydah's letter reached the Caliph, and reading it, he
 saw that she confessed her offense and sent her excuses to him
 therefor, he said to himself, "Verily, all sins doth Allah
 forgive-aye, Gracious, Merciful is He!" And he returned her an
 answer expressing satisfaction and pardon and forgiveness for what was
 past, whereat she rejoiced greatly.
 </p><p>  As for Khalifah the fisherman, the Caliph assigned him a monthly
 solde of fifty dinars, and took him into especial favor, which would
 lead to rank and dignity, honor and worship. Then he kissed ground
 before the Commander of the Faithful and went forth with stately gait.
 When he came to the door, the eunuch Sandal, who had given him the
 hundred dinars, saw him, and knowing him, said to him, "O Fisherman,
 whence all this?" So he told him all that had befallen him, first
 and last, whereat Sandal rejoiced, because he had been the cause of
 his enrichment, and said to him, "Wilt thou not give me largess of
 this wealth which is now become thine?" So Khalifah put hand to
 pouch and taking out a purse containing a thousand dinars, gave it
 to the eunuch, who said, "Keep thy coins, and Allah bless thee
 therein!" and marveled at his manliness and at the liberality of his
 soul, for all his late poverty.
 </p><p>  Then, leaving the eunuch, Khalifah mounted his she-mule and rode,
 with the slaves' hands on her crupper, till he came to his lodging
 at the khan, whilst the folk stared at him in surprise for that
 which had betided him of advancement. When he alighted from his beast,
 they accosted him and inquired the cause of his change from poverty to
 prosperity, and he told them an that had happened to him from incept
 to conclusion. Then he bought a fine mansion and laid out thereon much
 money, till it was perfect in all points. And he took up his abode
 therein and was wont to recite thereon these two couplets:
 </p><p>   Behold a house that's like the Dwelling of Delight,
 <br>   Its aspect heals the sick and banishes despite.
 <br>   Its sojourn for the great and wise appointed is,
 <br>   And Fortune fair therein abideth day and night.
 <br></p><p>  Then, as soon as he was settled in his house, he sought him in
 marriage the daughter of one of the chief men of the city, a
 handsome girl, and went in unto her and led a life of solace and
 satisfaction, joyaunce and enjoyment; and he rose to passing affluence
 and exceeding prosperity. So when he found himself in this fortunate
 condition, he offered up thanks to Allah (extolled and excelled be
 He!) for what He had bestowed on him of wealth exceeding and of favors
 ever succeeding, praising his Lord with the praise of the grateful.
 And thereafter Khalifah continued to pay frequent visits to the Caliph
 Harun al-Rashid, with whom he found acceptance and who ceased not to
 overwhelm him with boons and bounty. And he abode in the enjoyment
 of the utmost honor and happiness and joy and gladness, and in
 riches more than sufficing and in rank ever rising- brief, a sweet
 life and a savory, pure as pleasurable, till there came to him die
 Destroyer of delights and the Sunderer of societies. And extolled be
 the perfection of Him to whom belong glory and permanence and He is
 the Living, the Eternal, who shall never die!
