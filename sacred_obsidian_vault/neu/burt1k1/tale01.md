 <center><h1>                THE TALE OF THE BULL AND THE ASS
 </h1></center><p>  KNOW, O my daughter, that there was once a merchant who owned much
 money and many men, and who was rich in cattle and camels. He had also
 a wife and family, and he dwelt in the country, being experienced in
 husbandry and devoted to agriculture. Now Allah Most High had
 endowed him with understanding the tongues of beasts and birds of
 every kind, but under pain of death if he divulged the gift to any. So
 he kept it secret for very fear. He had in his cow house a bull and an
 ass, each tethered in his own stall, one hard by the other. As the
 merchant was sitting near-hand one day with his servans and his
 children were playing about him, he heard and bull say to the ass:
 </p><p>  "Hail and health to thee O Father of Waking! for that thou
 enjoyest rest and good ministering. All under thee is clean-swept
 and fresh-sprinkled. Men wait upon thee and feed thee, and thy
 provaunt is sifted barley and thy drink pure spring water, while I
 (unhappy creature!) am led forth in the middle of the night, when they
 set on my neck the plow and a something called yoke, and I tire at
 cleaving the earth from dawn of day till set of sun. I am forced to do
 more than I can and to bear all manner of ill-treatment from night to
 night. After which they take me back with my sides torn, my neck
 flayed, my legs aching, and mine eyelids sored with tears. Then they
 shut me up in the byre and throw me beans and crushed straw mixed with
 dirt and chaff, and I lie in dung and filth and foul stinks through
 the livelong night. But thou art ever in a place swept and sprinkled
 and cleansed, and thou art always lying at ease, save when it
 happens (and seldom enough!) that the master hath some business,
 when he mounts thee and rides thee to town and returns with thee
 forthright. So it happens that I am toiling and distrest while thou
 takest thine ease and thy rest. Thou sleepest while I am sleepless,
 I hunger still while thou eatest thy fill, and I win contempt while
 thou winnest goodwill."
 </p><p>  When the bull ceased speaking, the ass turned toward him and said:
 "O Broad-o'-Brow, O thou lost one! He lied not who dubbed thee
 bullhead, for thou, O father of a bull, hast neither forethought nor
 contrivance. Thou art the simplest of simpletons, and thou knowest
 naught of good advisers. Hast thou not heard the saying of the wise?
 </p><p>     "For others these hardships and labors I bear,
 <br>     And theirs is the pleasure and mine is the care,
 <br>     As the bleacher who blacketh his brow in the sun
 <br>     To whiten the raiment which other men wear.
 <br></p><p>But thou, O fool, art full of zeal, and thou toilest and moilest
 before the master, and thou tearest and wearest and slayest thyself
 for the comfort of another. Hast thou never heard the saw that saith
 'None to guide and from the way go wide'? Thou wendest forth at the
 call to dawn prayer and thou returnest not till sundown, and through
 the livelong day thou endurest all manner hardships: to wit, beating
 and belaboring and bad language.
 </p><p>  "Now hearken to me, Sir Bull! When they tie thee to thy stinking
 manger, thou pawest the ground with thy forehand and lashest out
 with thy hind hoofs and pushest with thy horns and bellowest aloud, so
 they deem thee contented. And when they throw thee thy fodder, thou
 fallest on it with greed and hastenest to line thy fair fat paunch.
 But if thou accept any advice, it will be better for thee, and thou
 wilt lead an easier life even than mine. When thou goest afield and
 they lay the thing called yoke on thy neck, be down and rise not
 again, though haply they swings thee. And if thou rise, lie down a
 second time. And when they bring thee home and offer thee thy beans,
 fall backward and only sniff at thy meat and withdraw thee and taste
 it not, and be satisfied with thy crushed straw and chaff. And on this
 wise feign thou art sick, and cease not doing thus for a day or two
 days or even three days; so shalt thou have rest from toil and moil."
 </p><p>  When the Bull heard these words, he knew the ass to be his friend
 and thanked him, saying, "Right is thy rede," and prayed that all
 blessings might requite him, and cried: "O Father Wakener! Thou hast
 made up for my failings." (Now the merchant, O my daughter, understood
 all that passed between them.) Next day the driver took the bull
 and, settling the plow on his neck, made him work as wont. But the
 bull began to shirk his plowing, according to the advice of the ass,
 and the plowman drubbed him till he broke the yoke and made off. But
 the man caught him up and leathered him till he despaired of his life.
 Not the less, however, would he do nothing but stand still and drop
 down till the evening. Then the herd led him home and stabled him in
 his stall, but he drew back from his manger and neither stamped nor
 ramped nor butted nor bellowed as he was wont to do, whereat the man
 wondered. He brought him the beans and husks, but he sniffed at them
 and left them and lay down as far from them as he could and passed the
 whole night fasting. The peasant came next morning and, seeing the
 manger full of beans, the crushed straw untasted, and the ox lying
 on his back in sorriest plight, with legs outstretched and swollen
 belly, he was concerned for him, and said to himself, "By Allah, he
 hath assuredly sickened, and this is the cause why he would not plow
 yesterday."
 </p><p>  Then he went to the merchant and reported: "O my master, the bull is
 ailing. He refused his fodder last night- nay, more, he hath not
 tasted a scrap of it this morning." Now the merchant-farmer understood
 what all this meant, because he had overheard the talk between the
 bull and the ass, so quoth he, "Take that rascal donkey, and set the
 yoke on his neck, and bind him to the plow and make him do bull's
 work." Thereupon the plowman took the ass, and worked him through the
 livelong day at the bull's task. And when be failed for weakness, he
 made him eat stick till his ribs were sore and his sides were sunken
 and his neck was rayed by the yoke. And when he came home in the
 evening he could hardly drag his limbs along, either forehand or
 hind legs. But as for the bull, he had passed the day lying at full
 length, and had eaten his fodder with an excellent appetite, and he
 ceased not calling down blessings on the ass for his good advice,
 unknowing what had come to him on his account.
 </p><p>  So when night set in and the ass returned to the byre, the bull rose
 up before him in honor, and said: "May good tidings gladden thy heart,
 O Father Wakener! Through thee I have rested all this day, and I
 have eaten my meat in peace and quiet." But the ass returned no reply,
 for wrath and heartburning and fatigue and the beating he had
 gotten. And he repented with the most grievous of repentance, and
 quoth he to himself: "This cometh of my folly in giving good
 counsel. As the saw saith, I was in joy and gladness, naught save my
 officiousness brought me this sadness. And now I must take thought and
 put a trick upon him and return him to his place, else I die." Then he
 went aweary to his manger while the bull thanked him and blessed him.
 </p><p>  And even so, O my daughter (said the Wazir) thou wilt die for lack
 of wits. Therefore sit thee still and say naught and expose not thy
 life to such stress, for, by Allah, I offer thee the best advice,
 which cometh of my affection and kindly solicitude for thee. "O my
 father," she answered, "needs must I go up to this King and be married
 to him." Quoth he, "Do not this deed," and quoth she, "Of a truth I
 will." Whereat he rejoined, "If thou be not silent and bide still, I
 will do with thee even what the merchant did with his wife." "And what
 did be?" asked she.
 </p><p>  Know then (answered the Wazir) that after the return of the ass
 the merchant came out on the terrace roof with his wife and family,
 for it was a moonlit night and the moon at its full. Now the terrace
 overlooked the cow house, and presently as he sat there with his
 children playing about him, the trader heard the ass say to the
 bull, "Tell me, O Father Broad-o'-Brow, what thou purposest to do
 tomorrow." The bull answered: "What but continue to follow thy
 counsel, O Aliboron? Indeed it was as good as good could be, and it
 hath given me rest and repose, nor will I now depart from it one
 tittle. So when they bring me my meat, I will refuse it and blow out
 my belly and counterfeit crank." The ass shook his head and said,
 "Beware of so doing, O Father of a Bull!" The buff asked, "Why?" and
 the ass answered, "Know that I am about to give thee the best of
 counsel, for verily I heard our owner say to the herd, 'If the bull
 rise not from his place to do his work this morning and if he retire
 from his fodder this day, make him over to the butcher that he may
 slaughter him and give his flesh to the poor, and fashion a bit of
 leather from his hide.' Now I fear for thee on account of this. So
 take my advice ere a calamity befall thee, and when they bring thee
 thy fodder, eat it and rise up and bellow and paw the ground, or our
 master will assuredly slay thee. And peace be with thee!"
 </p><p>  Thereupon the bull arose and lowed aloud and thanked the ass, and
 said, "Tomorrow I will readily go forth with them." And he at once ate
 up all his meat and even licked the manger. (All this took place and
 the owner was listening to their talk.) Next morning the trader and
 his wife went to the bull's crib and sat down, and the driver came and
 led forth the bull, who, seeing his owner, whisked his tail and
 brake wind, and frisked about so lustily that the merchant laughed a
 loud laugh and kept laughing till he fell on his back. His wife
 asked him, "Whereat laughest thou with such loud laughter as this?"
 and he answered her, "I laughed at a secret something which I have
 heard and seen but cannot say lest I die my death." She returned,
 "Perforce thou must discover it to me, and disclose the cause of thy
 laughing even if thou come by thy death!" But he rejoined, "I cannot
 reveal what beasts and birds say in their lingo for fear I die."
 Then quoth she: "By Allah, thou liest! This is a mere pretext. Thou
 laughest at none save me, and now thou wouldest hide somewhat from me.
 But by the Lord of the Heaven, an thou disclose not the cause I will
 no longer cohabit with thee, I will leave thee at once." And she sat
 down and cried.
 </p><p>  Whereupon quoth the merchant: "Woe betide thee! What means thy
 weeping? Fear Allah, and leave these words and query me no more
 questions." "Needs must thou tell me the cause of that laugh," said
 she, and he replied: "Thou wettest that when I prayed Allah to
 vouchsafe me understanding of the tongues of beasts and birds, I
 made a vow never to disclose the secret to any under pain of dying
 on the spot." "No matter!" cried she. "Tell me what secret passed
 between the bull and the ass and die this very hour an thou be so
 minded." And she ceased not to importune him till he was worn-out
 and clean distraught. So at last he said, "Summon thy father and thy
 mother and our kith and kin and sundry of our neighbors." Which she
 did, and he sent for the kazi and his assessors, intending to make his
 will and reveal to her his secret and die the death; for he loved
 her with love exceeding because she was his cousin, the daughter of
 his father's brother, and the mother of his children, and he had lived
 with her a life of a hundred and twenty years.
 </p><p>  Then, having assembled all the family and the folk of his
 neighborhood, he said to them, "By me there hangeth a strange story,
 and 'tis such that if I discover the secret to any, I am a dead
 man." Therefore quoth every one of those present to the woman,
 "Allah upon thee, leave this sinful obstinacy and recognize the
 right of this matter, lest haply thy husband and the father of thy
 children die." But she rejoined, "I will not turn from it till he tell
 me, even though he come by his death." So they ceased to urge her, and
 the trader rose from amongst them and repaired to an outhouse to
 perform the wuzu ablution, and he purposed thereafter to return and to
 tell them his secret and to die.
 </p><p>  Now, Daughter Scheherazade, that merchant had in his outhouses
 some fifty hens under one cock, and whilst making ready to farewell
 his folk he heard one of his many farm dogs thus address in his own
 tongue the cock, who was flapping his wings and crowing lustily and
 jumping from one hen's back to another and treading all in turn,
 saying: "O Chanticleer! How mean is thy wit and how shameless is thy
 conduct! Be he disappointed who brought thee up. Art thou not
 ashamed of thy doings on such a day as this?" "And what," asked the
 rooster, "hath occurred this day?" when the dog answered; "Dost thou
 not know that our master is this day making ready for his death? His
 wife is resolved that he shall disclose the secret taught to him by
 Allah, and the moment he so doeth he shall surely die. We dogs are all
 a-mourning, but thou clappest thy wings and clarionest thy loudest and
 treadest hen after hen. Is this an hour for pastime and pleasuring?
 Art thou not ashamed of thyself?"
 </p><p>  "Then by Allah," quoth the cock, "is our master a lackwit and a
 man scanty of sense. If he cannot manage matters with a single wife,
 his life is not worth prolonging. Now I have some fifty dame partlets,
 and I please this and provoke that and starve one and stuff another,
 and through my good governance they are all well under my control.
 This our master pretendeth to wit and wisdom, and she hath but one
 wife and yet knoweth not how to manage her." Asked the dog, "What
 then, O Cock, should the master do to will clear of his strait?" "He
 should arise forthright," answered the cock, "and take some twigs from
 yon mulberry tree and give her a regular back-basting and
 ribroasting till she cry: 'I repent, O my lord! I will never ask
 thee a question as Ion, as I live!' Then let him beat her once more
 and soundly, and when he shall have done this, he shall sleep free
 from care and enjoy life. But this master of ours owns neither sense
 nor judgment."
 </p><p>  "Now, Daughter Scheherazade," continued the Wazir, "I will do to
 thee as did that husband to that wife." Said Scheherazade, "And what
 did he do?" He replied, "When the merchant heard the wise words spoken
 by his cock to his dog, he arose in haste and sought his wife's
 chamber, after cutting for her some mulberry twigs and hiding them
 there. And then he called to her, "Come into the closet, that I may
 tell thee the secret while no one seeth me, and then die." She entered
 with him and he locked the door and came down upon her with so sound a
 beating of back and shoulders, ribs, arms, and legs, saying the
 while "Wilt thou ever be asking questions about what concerneth thee
 not?" that she was well-nigh senseless. Presently she cried out: "I am
 of the repentant! By Allah, I will ask thee no more questions, and
 indeed I repent sincerely and wholesomely." Then she kissed his hand
 and feet and he led her out of the room submissive, as a wife should
 be. Her parents and all the company rejoiced and sadness and
 mourning were changed into joy and gladness.
 </p><p>  Thus the merchant learnt family discipline from his cock and he
 and his wife lived together the happiest of lives until death. And
 thou also, O my daughter! continued the Wazir, unless thou turn from
 this matter I will do by thee what that trader did to his wife. But
 she answered him with much decision: "I will never desist, O my
 father, nor shall this tale change my purpose. Leave such talk and
 tattle. I will not listen to thy words and if thou deny me, I will
 marry myself to him despite the nose of thee. And first I will go up
 to the King myself and alone and I will say to him: 'I prayed my
 father to wive me with thee, but he refused, being resolved to
 disappoint his lord, grudging the like of me to the like of thee'."
 Her father asked, "Must this needs be?" and she answered, "Even so."
 </p><p>  Hereupon the Wazir, being weary of lamenting and contending,
 persuading and dissuading her, all to no purpose, went up to King
 Shahryar and, after blessing him and kissing the ground before him,
 told him all about his dispute with his daughter from first to last
 and how he designed to bring her to him that night. The King
 wondered with exceeding wonder, for he had made an especial
 exception of the Wazir's daughter, and said to him: "O most faithful
 of counsellors, how is this? Thou wettest that I have sworn by the
 Raiser of the Heavens that after I have gone into her this night I
 shall say to thee on the morrow's 'Take her and slay her!' And if thou
 slay her not, I will slay thee in her stead without fail." "Allah
 guide thee to glory and lengthen thy life, O King of the Age,"
 answered the Wazir. "It is she that hath so determined. All this
 have I told her and more, but she will not hearken to me and she
 persisteth in passing this coming night with the King's Majesty." So
 Shahryar rejoiced greatly and said, "'Tis well. Go get her ready,
 and this night bring her to me." The Wazir returned to his daughter
 and reported to her the command, saying, "Allah make not thy father
 desolate by thy loss!"
 </p><p>  But Scheherazade rejoiced with exceeding joy and get ready all she
 required and said to her younger sister, Dunyazade: "Note well what
 directions I entrust to thee! When I have gone into the King I will
 send for thee, and when thou comest to me and seest that he hath had
 his carnal will of me, do thou say to me: 'O my sister, an thou be
 not sleepy, relate to me some new story, delectable and delightsome,
 the better to speed our waking hours.' And I will tell thee a tale
 which shall be our deliverance, if so Allah please, and which shall
 turn the King from his bloodthirsty custom." Dunyazade answered
 "With love and gladness."
 </p><p>  So when it was night, their father the Wazir carried Scheherazade to
 the King, who was gladdened at the sight and asked, "Hast thou brought
 me my need?" And he answered, "I have." But when the King took her
 to his bed and fell to toying with her and wished to go in to her, she
 wept, which made him ask, "What aileth thee?" She replied, "O King
 of the Age, I have a younger sister, and lief would I take leave of
 her this night before I see the dawn." So he sent at once for
 Dunyazade and she came and kissed the ground between his hands, when
 he permitted her to take her seat near the foot of the couch. Then the
 King arose and did away with his bride's maidenhead and the three fell
 asleep.
 </p><p>  But when it was midnight Scheherazade awoke and signaled to her
 sister Dunyazade, who sat up and said, "Allah upon thee, O my
 sister, recite to us some new story, delightsome and delectable,
 wherewith to while away the waking hours of our latter night." "With
 joy and goodly gree," answered Scheherazade, "if this pious and
 auspicious King permit me." "Tell on," quoth the King, who chanced
 to be sleepless and restless and therefore was pleased with the
 prospect of hearing her story. So Scheherazade rejoiced, and thus,
 on the first night of the Thousand Nights and a Night, she began her
 recitations.
