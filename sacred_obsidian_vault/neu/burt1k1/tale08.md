 <center><h1>                   THE ELDEST LADY'S TALE
 </h1></center><p>  VERILY a strange tale is mine and 'tis this: Yon two black bitches
 are my eldest sisters by one mother and father, and these two others
 she who beareth upon her the signs of stripes and the third our
 procuratrix, are my sisters by another mother. When my father died,
 each took her share of the heritage and after a while my mother also
 deceased, leaving me and my sisters german three thousand dinars, so
 each daughter received her portion of a thousand dinars and I the
 same, albe' the youngest. In due course of time my sisters married
 with the usual festivities and lived with their husbands, who bought
 merchandise with their wives' moneys and set out on their travels
 together. Thus they threw me off. My brothers-in-law were absent
 with their wives five years, during which period they spent all the
 money they had and, becoming bankrupt, deserted my sisters in
 foreign parts amid stranger folk.
 </p><p>  After five years my eldest sister returned to me in beggar's gear
 with her clothes in rags and tatters and a dirty old mantilla, and
 truly she was in the foulest and sorriest plight. At first sight I did
 not know my own sister, but presently I recognized her and said, "What
 state is this?" "O our sister," she replied, "words cannot undo the
 done, and the reed of Destiny hath run through what Allah decreed."
 Then I sent her to the bath and dressed her in a suit of mine own, and
 boiled for her a bouillon and brought her some good wine, and said
 to her: "O my sister, thou art the eldest, who still standest to us in
 the stead of father and mother, and as for the inheritance which
 came to me as to you twain, Allah hath blessed it and prospered it
 to me with increase, and my circumstances are easy, for I have made
 much money by spinning and cleaning silk. And I and you will share
 my wealth alike."
 </p><p>  I entreated her with all kindliness and she abode with me a whole
 year, during which our thoughts and fancies were always full of our
 other sister. Shortly after she too came home in yet fouler and
 sorrier plight than that of my eldest sister, and I dealt by her still
 more honorably than I had done by the first, and each of them had a
 share of my substance. After a time they said to me, "O our sister, we
 desire to marry again, for indeed we have not patience to drag on
 our days without husbands and to lead the lives of widows
 bewitched," and I replied: "O eyes of me! Ye have hitherto seen scanty
 weal in wedlock, for nowadays good men and true are become rareties
 and curiosities, nor do I deem your projects advisable, as ye have
 already made trial of matrimony and have failed." But they would not
 accept my advice, and married without my consent. Nevertheless I
 gave them outfit and dowries out of my money, and they fared forth
 with their mates.
 </p><p>  In a mighty little time their husbands played them false and, taking
 whatever they could lay hands upon, levanted and left them in the
 lurch. Thereupon they came to me ashamed and in abject case and made
 their excuses to me, saying: "Pardon our fault and be not wroth with
 us, for although thou art younger in years yet art thou older in
 wit. Henceforth we will never make mention of marriage, so take us
 back as thy handmaidens that we may eat our mouthful." Quoth I,
 "Welcome to you, O my sisters, there is naught dearer to me than you."
 And I took them in and redoubled my kindness to them. We ceased not to
 live after this loving fashion for a full year, when I resolved to
 sell my wares abroad and first to fit me a conveyance for Bassorah. So
 I equipped a large ship, and loaded her with merchandise and
 valuable goods for traffic and with provaunt and all needful for a
 voyage, and said to my sisters, "Will ye abide at home whilst I
 travel, or would ye prefer to accompany me on the voyage?" "We will
 travel with thee," answered they, "for we cannot bear to be parted
 from thee." So I divided my moneys into two parts, one to accompany me
 and the other to be left in charge of a trusty person, for, as I
 said to myself, "Haply some accident may happen to the ship and yet we
 remain alive, in which case we shall find on our return what may stand
 us in good stead."
 </p><p>  I took my two sisters and we went a-voyaging some days and nights,
 but the master was careless enough to miss his course, and the ship
 went astray with us and entered a sea other than the sea we sought.
 For a time we knew naught of this, and the wind blew fair for us ten
 days, after which the lookout man went aloft to see about him and
 cried, "Good news!" Then he came down rejoicing and said, "I have seen
 what seemeth to be a city as 'twere a pigeon." Hereat we rejoiced, and
 ere an hour of the day had passed, the buildings showed plain in the
 offing, and we asked the Captain, "What is the name of yonder city?"
 and he answered: "By Allah, I wot not, for I never saw it before and
 never sailed these seas in my life. But since our troubles have ended
 in safety, remains for you only to land where with your merchandise,
 and if you find selling profitable, sell and make your market of
 what is there, and if not, we will rest here two days and provision
 ourselves and fare away."
 </p><p>  So we entered the port and the Captain went up town and was absent
 awhile, after which he returned to us and said, "Arise, go up into the
 city and marvel at the works of Allah with His creatures, and pray
 to be preserved from His righteous wrath!" So we landed, and going
 up into the city, saw at the gate men hending staves in hand, but when
 we drew near them, behold, they had been translated by the anger of
 Allah and had become stones. Then we entered the city and found all
 who therein woned into black stones enstoned. Not an inhabited house
 appeared to the espier, nor was there a blower of fire. We were
 awe-struck at the sight, and threaded the market streets, where we
 found the goods and gold and silver left lying in their places, and we
 were glad and said, "Doubtless there is some mystery in all this."
 </p><p>  Then we dispersed about the thoroughfares and each busied himself
 with collecting the wealth and money and rich stuffs, taking scanty
 heed of friend or comrade.
 </p><p>  As for myself, I went up to the castle, which was strongly
 fortified, and, entering the King's palace by its gate of red gold,
 found all the vaiselle of gold and silver, and the King himself seated
 in the midst of his chamberlains and nabobs and emirs and wazirs, an
 clad in raiment which confounded man's art. I drew nearer and saw
 him sitting on a throne encrusted and inlaid with pearls and gems, and
 his robes were of gold cloth adorned with jewels of every kind, each
 one flashing like a star. Around him stood fifty Mamelukes, white
 slaves, clothed in silks of divers sorts, holding their drawn swords
 in their hands. But when I drew near to them, lo! all were black
 stones. My understanding was confounded at the sight, but I walked
 on and entered the great hall of the harem, whose walls I found hung
 with tapestries of gold-striped silk, and spread with silken carpets
 embroidered with golden flowers. Here I saw the Queen lying at full
 length arrayed in robes purfled with fresh young pearls. On her head
 was a diadem set with many sorts of gems each fit for a ring, and
 around her neck hung collars and necklaces. All her raiment and her
 ornaments were in natural state, but she had been turned into a
 black stone by Allah's wrath.
 </p><p>  Presently I espied an open door, for which I made straight, and
 found leading to it a flight of seven steps. So I walked up and came
 upon a place pargeted with marble and spread and hung with gold-worked
 carpets and tapestry, a-middlemost of which stood a throne of
 juniper wood inlaid with pearls and precious stones and set with
 bosses of emeralds. In the further wall was an alcove whose
 curtains, bestrung with pearls, were let down and I saw a light
 issuing therefrom, so I drew near and perceived that the light came
 from a precious stone as big as an ostrich egg, set at the upper end
 of the alcove upon a little chryselephantine couch of ivory and
 gold. And this jewel, blazing like the sun, cast its rays wide and
 side. The couch also was spread with all manner of silken stuffs
 amazing the gazer with their richness and beauty. I marveled much at
 all this, especially when seeing in that place candies ready
 lighted, and I said in my mind, "Needs must someone have lighted these
 candles." Then I went forth and came to the kitchen and thence to
 the buttery and the King's treasure chambers, and continued to explore
 the palace and to pace from place to place. I forgot myself in my
 awe and marvel at these matters and I was drowned in thought till
 the night came on.
 </p><p>  Then I would have gone forth, but knowing not the gate, I lost my
 way, so I returned to the alcove whither the lighted candles
 directed me and sat down upon the couch, and wrapping myself in a
 coverlet, after I had repeated somewhat from the Koran, I would have
 slept but could not, for restlessness possessed me. When night was
 at its noon I heard a voice chanting the Koran in sweetest accents,
 but the tone thereof was weak. So I rose, glad to hear the silence
 broken, and followed the sound until I reached a closet whose door
 stood ajar. Then, peeping through a chink, I considered the place
 and lo! it was an oratory wherein was a prayer niche with two wax
 candles burning and lamps hanging from the ceiling. In it too was
 spread a prayer carpet whereupon sat a youth fair to see, and before
 him on its stand was a copy of the Koran, from which he was reading. I
 marveled to see him alone alive amongst the people of the city and
 entering, saluted him. Whereupon he raised his eyes and returned my
 salaam. Quoth I, "Now by the truth of what thou readest in Allah's
 Holy Book, I conjure thee to answer my question." He looked upon me
 with a smile and said: "O handmaid of Allah, first tell me the cause
 of thy coming hither, and I in turn will tell what hath befallen
 both me and the people of this city, and what was the reason of my
 escaping their doom." So I told him my story, whereat he wondered, and
 I questioned him of the people of the city, when he replied, "Have
 patience with me for awhile, O my sister!" and, reverently closing the
 Holy Book, he laid it up in a satin bag. Then he seated me by his
 side, and I looked at him and behold, he was as the moon at its
 full, fair of face and rare of form, soft-sided and slight, of
 well-proportioned height, and cheek smoothly bright and diffusing
 light. I glanced at him with one glance of eyes which caused me a
 thousand sighs, and my heart was at once taken captive-wise, so I
 asked him, "O my lord and my love, tell me that whereof I questioned
 thee," and he answered:
 </p><p>  "Hearing is obeying! Know, O handmaid of Allah, that this city was
 the capital of my father who is the King thou sawest on the throne
 transfigured by Allah's wrath to a black stone, and the Queen thou
 foundest in the alcove is my mother. They and all the people of the
 city were Magians who fire adored in lieu of the Omnipotent Lord and
 were wont to swear by lowe and heat and shade and light, and the
 spheres revolving day and night. My father had ne'er a son till he was
 blest with me near the last of his days, and he reared me till I
 grew up and prosperity anticipated me in all things. Now it is
 fortuned there was with us an old woman well stricken in years, a
 Moslemah who, inwardly believing in Allah and His Apostle, conformed
 outwardly with the religion of my people. And my father placed
 thorough confidence in her for that he knew her to be trustworthy
 and virtuous, and he treated her with ever-increasing kindness,
 believing her to be of his own belief.
 </p><p>  "So when I was well-nigh grown up my father committed me to her
 charge saying: 'Take him and educate him and teach him the rules of
 our faith. Let him have the best instructions and cease not thy
 fostering care of him.' So she took me and taught me the tenets of
 Al-Islam with the divine ordinances of the wuzu ablution and the
 five daily prayers and she made me learn the Koran by rote, often
 repeating, 'Serve none save Allah Almighty!' When I had mastered
 this much of knowledge, she said to me, 'O my son, keep this matter
 concealed from thy sire and reveal naught to him, lest he slay
 thee." So I hid it from him, and I abode on this wise for a term of
 days, when the old woman died, and the people of the city redoubled in
 their impiety and arrogance and the error of their ways.
 </p><p>  "One day while they were as wont, behold, they heard a loud and
 terrible sound and a crier crying out with a voice like roaring
 thunder so every ear could hear, far and near: 'O folk of this city,
 leave ye your fire-worshiping and adore Allah the All-compassionate
 King!" At this, fear and terror fell upon the citizens and they
 crowded to my father (he being King of the city) and asked him:
 'What is this awesome voice we have heard; for it hath confounded us
 with the excess of its terror?' And he answered: 'Let not a voice
 fright you nor shake your steadfast sprite nor turn you back from
 the faith which is right.' Their hearts inclined to his words and they
 ceased not to worship the fire and they persisted in rebellion for a
 full year from the time they heard the first voice. And on the
 anniversary came a second cry, and a third at the head of the third
 year, each year once.
 </p><p>  Still they persisted in their malpractices till one day at break
 of dawn, judgment and the wrath of Heaven descended upon them with all
 suddenness, and by the visitation of Allah all were metamorphosed into
 black stones, they and their beasts and their cattle, and none was
 saved save myself, who at the time was engaged in my devotions. From
 that day to this I am in the case thou seest, constant in prayer and
 fasting and reading and reciting the Koran, but I am indeed grown
 weary by reason of my loneliness, having none to bear me company."
 </p><p>  Then said I to him (for in very sooth he had won my heart and was
 the lord of my life and soul): "O youth, wilt thou fare with me to
 Baghdad city and visit the Ulema and men teamed in the law and doctors
 of divinity and get thee increase of wisdom and understanding and
 theology? And know that she who standeth in thy presence will be thy
 handmaid, albeit she be head of her family and mistress over men and
 eunuchs and servants and slaves. Indeed my life was no life before
 it fell in with thy youth. I have here a ship laden with
 merchandise, and in very truth Destiny drove me to this city that I
 might come to the knowledge of these matters, for it was fated that we
 should meet." And I ceased not to persuade him and speak him fair
 and use every art till he consented. I slept that night at his feet
 and hardly knowing where I was for excess of joy.
 </p><p>  As soon as the next morning dawned (she pursued, addressing the
 Caliph), I arose and we entered the treasuries and took thence
 whatever was light in weight and great in worth. Then we went down
 side by side from the castle to the city, where we were met by the
 Captain and my sisters and slaves, who had been seeking for me. When
 they saw me, they rejoiced and asked what had stayed me, and I told
 them all I had seen and related to them the story of the young
 Prince and the transformation wherewith the citizens had been justly
 visited. Hereat all marveled, but when my two sisters (these two
 bitches, O Commander of the Faithful!) saw me by the side of my
 young lover, they jaloused me on his account and were wroth and
 plotted mischief against me. We awaited a fair wind and went on
 board rejoicing and ready to fly for joy by reason of the goods we had
 gotten, but my own greatest joyance was in the youth. And we waited
 awhile till the wind blew fair for us and then we set sail and fared
 forth.
 </p><p>  Now as we sat talking, my sisters asked me, "And what wilt thou do
 with this handsome young man?" and I answered, "I purpose to make
 him my husband!" Then I turned to him and said: "O my lord, I have
 that to propose to thee wherein thou must not cross me, and this it is
 that, when we reach Baghdad, my native city, I offer thee my life as
 thy handmaiden in holy matrimony, and thou shalt be to me baron and
 I will be femme to thee." He answered, "I hear and I obey! Thou art my
 lady and my mistress and whatso thou doest I will not gainsay." Then I
 turned to my sisters and said: "This is my gain. I content me with
 this youth and those who have gotten aught of my property, let them
 keep it as their gain with my goodwill." "Thou sayest and doest well,"
 answered the twain, but they imagined mischief against me.
 </p><p>  We ceased not spooning before a fair wind till we had exchanged
 the sea of peril for the seas of safety, and in a few days we made
 Bassorah city, whose buildings loomed clear before us as evening fell.
 But after we had retired to rest and were sound asleep, my two sisters
 arose and took me up, bed and all, and threw me into the sea. They did
 the same with the young Prince, who, as he could not swim, sank and
 was drowned, and Allah enrolled him in the noble army of martyrs. As
 for me, would Heaven I had been drowned with him, but Allah deemed
 that I should be of the saved, so when I awoke and found myself in the
 sea and saw the ship making off like a flash of lightning, He threw in
 my way a piece of timber, which I bestrided, and the waves tossed me
 to and fro till they cast me upon an island coast, a high land and
 an uninhabited. I landed and walked about the island the rest of the
 night, and when morning dawned, I saw a rough track barely fit for
 child of Adam to tread, leading to what proved a shallow ford
 connecting island and mainland.
 </p><p>  As soon as the sun had risen I spread my garments to dry in its
 rays, and ate of the fruits of the island and drank of its waters.
 Then I set out along the foot track and ceased not walking till I
 reached the mainland. Now when there remained between me and the
 city but a two hours' journey, behold, a great serpent, the bigness of
 a date palm, came fleeing toward me in all haste, gliding along now to
 the right, then to the left, till she was close upon me, whilst her
 tongue lolled groundward a span long and swept the dust as she went.
 She was pursued by a dragon who was not longer than two lances, and of
 slender build about the bulk of a spear, and although her terror
 lent her speed and she kept wriggling from side to side, he overtook
 her and seized her by the tail, whereat her tears streamed down and
 her tongue was thrust out in her agony. I took pity on her and,
 picking up a stone and calling upon Allah for aid, threw it at the
 dragon's head with such force that he died then and there, and the
 serpent, opening a pair of wings, flew into the lift and disappeared
 from before my eyes.
 </p><p>  I sat down marveling over that adventure, but I was weary and,
 drowsiness overcoming me, I slept where I was for a while. When I
 awoke I found a jet-black damsel sitting at my feet shampooing them,
 and by her side stood two black bitches (my sisters, O Commander of
 the Faithful!). I was ashamed before her and, sitting up, asked her,
 "O my sister, who and what art thou?" and she answered: "How soon hast
 thou forgotten me! I am she for whom thou wroughtest a good deed and
 sowedest the seed of gratitude and slewest her foe, for I am the
 serpent whom by Allah's aidance thou didst just now deliver from the
 dragon. I am a Jinniyah and he was a Jinn who hated me, and none saved
 my life from him save thou. As soon as thou freedest me from him I
 flew on the wind to the ship whence thy sisters threw thee, and
 removed all that was therein to thy house. Then I ordered my attendant
 Marids to sink the ship, and I transformed thy two sisters into
 these black bitches, for I know all that hath passed between them
 and thee. But as for the youth, of a truth he is drowned."
 </p><p>  So saying, she flew up with me and the bitches, and presently set us
 down on the terrace roof of my house, wherein I found ready stored the
 whole of what property was in my ship, nor was aught of it missing.
 "Now (continued the serpent that was), I swear by all engraven on
 the seal ring of Solomon (with whom be peace!) unless thou deal to
 each of these bitches three hundred stripes every day I will come
 and imprison thee forever under the earth." I answered, "Hearkening
 and obedience!" and away she flew. But before going she again
 charged me saying, "I again swear by Him who made the two seas flow
 (and this be my second oath), if thou gainsay me I will come and
 transform thee like thy sisters." Since then I have never failed, O
 Commander of the Faithful, to beat them with that number of blows till
 their blood flows with my tears, I pitying them the while, and well
 they wot that their being scourged is no fault of mine and they accept
 my excuses. And this is my tale and my history!
