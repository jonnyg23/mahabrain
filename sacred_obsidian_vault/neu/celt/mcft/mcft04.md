 <center><h1>Paddy O'Kelly and the Weasel</h1></center>
   <p>
 A LONG
   time ago there was once a man of the name of Paddy O'Kelly, living near Tuam,
   in the county Galway. He rose up one morning early, and he did not know what
   time of day it was, for there was fine light coming from the moon. He wanted
   to go to the fair of Cauher-na-mart to sell a <i>sturk </i>of an ass that he
   had.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 He had not gone more than three miles of the
 road when a great darkness came on, and a shower began falling. He saw a large
 house among trees about five hundred yards in from the road, and he said to
 himself that he would go to that house till the shower would be over. When he
 got to the house he found the door open before him, and in with him. He saw a
 large room to his left, and a fine fire in the grate. He sat down on a stool
 that was beside the wall, and began falling asleep, when he saw a big weasel
 coming to the fire with something yellow in his mouth, which it dropped on the
 hearth-stone, and then it went away. She soon came back again with the same
 thing in her mouth, and he saw that it was a guinea she had. She dropped it on
 the hearth-stone, and went away again. She was coming and going, until there was
 a great heap of guineas on the hearth. But at last, when she got her gone, Paddy
 rose up, thrust all the gold she had gathered into his pockets, and out with
 him.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 He had not gone far till he heard the weasel coming after him,
 and she screeching as loud as a bag-pipes. She went before Paddy and got on the
 road, and she was twisting herself back and forwards, and trying to get a hold
 of his throat. Paddy had a good oak stick, and he kept her from him, until two
 men came up who were going to the same fair, and one of them had a good dog, and
 it routed the weasel into a hole in the wall.</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy went to the fair, and instead of coming home with the
 money he got for his old ass, as he thought would be the way with him in the
 morning, he went and bought a horse with some of the money he took from the
 weasel, and he came home riding. When he came to the place where the dog had
 routed the weasel into the hole in the wall, she came out before him, gave a
 leap, and caught the horse by the throat. The horse made off; and Paddy could
 not stop him, till at last he gave a leap into a big drain that was full up of
 water and black mud, and he was drowning and choking as fast as he could, until
 men who were coming from Galway came up and drove away the weasel.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Paddy brought the horse home with him, and
 put him into the cow's byre and fell asleep. Next morning, the day on the
 morrow, Paddy rose up early, and went out to give his horse hay and oats. When
 he got to the door he saw the weasel coming out of the byre and she covered with
 blood.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "My seven thousand curses on you," said Paddy,
 "but I'm afraid you've done harm."</p>
 
 <p>
 He went in and found the horse, a pair of milch cows, and two
 calves dead. He came out and set a dog he had after the weasel. The dog got a
 hold of her, and she got a hold of the dog. The dog was a good one, but he was
 forced to loose his hold of her before Paddy could come up. He kept his eye on
 her, however, all through, until he saw her creeping into a little hovel that
 was on the brink of a lake. Paddy came running, and when he got to the little
 hut he gave the dog a shake to rouse him up and put anger on him, and then he
 sent him in. When the dog went in he began barking. Paddy went in after him, and
 saw an old hag in the corner. He asked her if she saw a weasel coming in there.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 "I did not," said she; "I'm all destroyed with a
 plague of sickness, and if you don't go out quick, you'll catch it from
 me."</p>
 
 <p>
 While Paddy and the hag were talking, the dog kept moving in all
 the time, till at last he gave a leap and caught the hag by the throat. She
 screeched and said: "Paddy Kelly, take off your dog, and I'll make you a
 rich man."</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy made the dog loose his hold, and said: "Tell me who
 you are, or why did you kill my horse and my cows ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "And why did you bring away my gold that I was gathering
 for five hundred years throughout the hills and hollows of the world ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I thought you were a weasel," said Paddy, " or I
 wouldn't touch your gold ; and another thing," says he, "if you're for
 five hundred years in this world, it's time for you to go to rest now."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I committed a great crime in my youth," said the hag,
 and now I am to be released from my sufferings if you can pay twenty pounds for
 a hundred and three-score masses for me."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Where's the money ?" said Paddy.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "Go and dig under a bush that's over a
 little well in the corner of that field there without, and you'll get a pot
 filled with gold. Pay the twenty pounds for the masses, and yourself shall have
 the rest. When you'll lift the flag off the pot, you'll see a big black dog
 coming out ; but don't be afraid before him ; he is a son of mine. When you get
 the gold, buy the house in which you saw me at first. You'll get it cheap, for
 it has the name of there being a ghost in it. My son will be down in the cellar.
 He'll do you no harm, but he'll be a good friend to you. I shall be dead a month
 from this day, and when you get me dead, put a coal under this little hut and
 burn it. Don't tell a living soul anything about me - and the luck will be on
 you."</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "What is your name ?" said Paddy.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Mary Kerwan," said the hag.</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy went home, and when the darkness of the night came on, he
 took with him a spade and went to the bush that was in the corner of the field,
 and began digging. It was not long till he found the pot, and when he took the
 flag off of it a big black dog leaped out, and off and away with him and Paddy's
 dog after him.</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy brought home the gold, and hid it in the cow-house. About
 a month after that he went to the fair of Galway, and bought a pair of cows, a
 horse, and a dozen sheep. The neighbours did not know where he had got all the
 money; they said that he had a share with the good people.</p>
 
 <p>
 One day Paddy dressed himself, and went to the gentleman who
 owned the large house where he first saw the weasel, and asked to buy the house
 of him, and the land that was round about.</p>
 
 <p>
 "You can have the house without paying any rent at all; but
 there is a ghost in it, and I wouldn't like you to go to live in it without my
 telling you, but I couldn't part with the land without getting a hundred pounds
 more than you have to offer me."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Perhaps I have as much as you have yourself;" said
 Paddy. "I'll be here to-morrow with the money, if you're ready to give me
 possession."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I'll be ready," said the gentleman.</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy went home and told his wife that he had bought a large
 house and a holding of land. "Where did you get the <i>money </i>?"says
 the wife.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Isn't it all one to you where I got it?" says Paddy.</p>
 
 <p>
 The day on the morrow Paddy went to the gentleman, gave him the
 money, and got possession of the house and land ; and the gentleman left him the
 furniture and everything that was in the house, into the bargain.</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy remained in the house that night, and when darkness came
 he went down to the cellar, and he saw a little man with his two legs spread on
 a barrel.</p>
 
 <p>
 "God save you, honest man," says he to Paddy.</p>
 
 <p>
 "The same to you," says Paddy.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Don't be afraid of me, at all," says the little man.
 " I'll be a friend to you, if you are able to keep a secret."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I am able, indeed ; I kept your mother's secret, and I'll
 keep yours as well."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Maybe you're thirsty?" said the little man.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I'm not free from it," said Paddy.</p>
 
 <p>
 The little man put a hand in his bosom and drew out a gold
 goblet. He gave it to Paddy, and said: "Draw wine out of that barrel under
 me."</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy drew the full up of the goblet, and handed it to the
 little man.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Drink yourself first," says he.</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy drank, drew another goblet, and handed it to the little
 man, and he drank it.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Fill up and drink again," said the little man.
 "I have a mind to be merry to-night."</p>
 
 <p>
 The pair of them sat there drinking until they were half drunk.
 Then the little man gave a leap down to the floor, and said to Paddy</p>
 
 <p>
 "Don't you like music ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I do, surely," said Paddy, "and I'm a good
 dancer, too."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Lift up the big flag over there in the corner, and you'll
 get my pipes under it."</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy lifted the flag, got the pipes, and gave them to the
 little man. He squeezed the pipes on him, and began playing melodious music.
 Paddy began dancing till he was tired. Then they had another drink, and the
 little man said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Do as my mother told you, and I'll show you great riches.
 You can bring your wife in here, but don't tell her that I'm there, and she
 won't see me. Any time at all that ale or wine are wanting, come here and draw.
 Farewell, now; go to sleep, and come again to me to-morrow night."</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy went to bed, and it wasn't long till he fell asleep.</p>
 
 <p>
 On the morning of the day on the morrow, Paddy went home, and
 brought his wife and children to the big house, and they were very comfortable.
 That night Paddy went down to the cellar ; the little man welcomed him and asked
 him did he wish to dance ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "Not till I get a drink," said Paddy.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Drink your fill," said the little man ; "that
 barrel will never be empty as long as you live."</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy drank the full of the goblet, and gave a drink to the
 little man. Then the little man said to him:</p>
 
 <p>
 "I am going to the Fortress of the Fairies to-night, to
 play music for the good people, and if you come with me you'll see fine fun.
 I'll give you a horse that you never saw the like of him before."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I'll go with you, and welcome," said Paddy ;
 "but what excuse will I make to my wife?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "I'll bring you away from her side without her knowing it,
 when you are both asleep together, and I'll bring you back to her the same
 way," said the little man.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I'm obedient," says Paddy; "we'll have another
 drink before I leave you."</p>
 
 <p>
 He drank drink after drink, till he was half drunk, and he went
 to bed with his wife.</p>
 
 <p>
 When he awoke he found himself riding on a broom near
 Doon-na-shee, and the little man riding on another besom by his side. When they
 came as far as the green hill of the Doon, the little man said a couple of words
 that Paddy did not understand. The green hill opened, and the pair went into a
 fine chamber.</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy never saw before a gathering like that which was in the
 Doon. The whole place was full up of little people, men and women, young and
 old. They all welcomed little Donal - that was the name of the piper - and Paddy
 O'Kelly. The king and queen of the fairies came up to them, and said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "We are all going on a visit to-night to Cnoc Matha, to the
 high king and queen of our people."</p>
 
 <p>
 They all rose up then and went out. There were horses ready for
 each one of them, and the <i>coash-t'ya-bower </i>for the king and queen. The
 king and queen got into the coach, each man leaped on his own horse, and be
 certain that Paddy was not behind. The piper went out before them, and began
 playing them music, and then off and away with them. It was not long till they
 came to Cnoc Matha. The hill opened, and the king of the fairy host passed in.</p>
 
 <p>
 Finvara and Nuala were there, the arch-king and queen of the
 fairy host of Connacht, and thousands of little persons. Finvara came up and
 said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "We are going to play a hurling match to-night against the
 fairy host of Munster, and unless we beat them our fame is gone for ever. The
 match is to be fought out on Moytura, under Slieve Belgadaun."</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The Connacht host cried out:</p>
 
 <p>
 "We are all ready, and we have no doubt but we'll beat
 them."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Out with ye all," cried the high king; "the men
 of the hill of Nephin will be on the ground before us."</p>
 
 <p>
 They all went out, and little Donal and twelve pipers more
 before them, playing melodious music. When they came to Moytura, the fairy host
 of Munster and the fairy men of the hill of Nephin were there before them.</p>
 
 <p>
 Now it is necessary for the fairy host to have two live men
 beside them when they are fighting or at a hurling match, and that was the
 reason that little Donal took Paddy O'Kelly with him. There was a man they
 called the "<i>Yellow Stongirya" </i>with the fairy host of Munster,
 from Ennis, in the County Clare.</p>
 
 <p>
 It was not long till the two hosts took sides ; the ball was
 thrown up between them, and the fun began in earnest.</p>
 
 <p>
 They were hurling away, and the pipers playing until Paddy
 O'Kelly saw the host of Munster getting the strong hand, and he began helping
 the fairy host of Connacht.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 The <i>Stongirya </i>came up and he made at Paddy O'Kelly, but
 Paddy turned him head over heels. From hurling the two hosts began at fighting,
 but it was not long until the host of Connacht beat the other host.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 Then the host of Munster made flying beetles of themselves, and
 they began eating every green thing that they came up to. They were destroying
 the country before them until they came as far as Cong. Then there rose up
 thousands of doves out of the hole, and they swallowed down the beetles.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 That hole has no other name until this day but Pull-na-gullam,
 the dove's hole.</p>
 
 <p>
 When the fairy host of Connacht won their battle, they came back
 to Cnoc Matha joyous enough, and the king Finvara gave Paddy O'Kelly a purse of
 gold, and the little piper brought him home, and put him into bed beside his
 wife, and left him sleeping there.</p>
 
 <p>
 A month went by after that without anything worth mentioning,
 until one night Paddy went down to the cellar, and the little man said to him:
 " My mother is dead; burn the house over her."</p>
 
 <p>
 "It is true for you," said Paddy. "She told me
 that she hadn't but a month to be in the world, and the month was up
 yesterday."</p>
 
 <p>
 On the next morning of the next day Paddy went to the hut and he
 found the hag dead. He put a coal under the hut and burned it. He came home and
 told the little man that the hag was burnt. The little man gave him a purse and
 said to him : "This purse will never be empty as long as you are alive.
 Now, you will never see me more ; but have a loving remembrance of the weasel.
 She was the beginning and the prime cause of your riches." Then he went
 away and Paddy never saw him again.</p>
 
 <p>
 Paddy O'Kelly and his wife lived for years after this in the
 large house, and when he died he left great wealth behind him, and a large
 family to spend it.</p>
 
 <p>
 There now is the story for you, from the first word to the last,
 as I heard it from my grandmother.</p>
