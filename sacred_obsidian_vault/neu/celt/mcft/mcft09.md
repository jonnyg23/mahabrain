 <center><h1>The Story of the McAndrew Family</h1></center>
   <p>
 
   A LONG time ago, in the County Mayo, there lived a rich man of the name of
   McAndrew. He owned cows and horses without number, not to mention ducks and
   geese and pigs; and his land extended as far as the eve could reach on the
   four sides of you.</p>
 
   <p>
 McAndrew was a lucky man, the neighbours all said; but as for
   himself; when he looked on his seven big sons growing up like weeds and with
   scarcely any more sense, he felt sore enough, for of all the stupid omadhauns
   the seven McAndrew brothers were the stupidest.</p>
 
   <p>
 When the youngest grew to be a man, the father built a house
   for each of them, and gave every one a piece of land and a few cows, hoping to
   make men of them before he died, for, as the old man said:</p>
 
   <p>
 "While God spares my life, I'll be able to have an eye to
   them, and maybe they will learn from experience."</p>
 
   <p>
 The seven young McAndrews were happy enough. Their fields were
   green, their cows were fat and sleek, and they thought they would never see a
   poor day.</p>
 
   <p>
 All went well for a time, and the day of the Fair of Killalla
   was as fine a day as ever shone in Ireland, when the whole seven got ready to
   be off<i>, </i>bright and early, in the morning.</p>
 
   <p>
 Each one of them drove before him three fine cows, and a finer
   herd, when they were all together, was never seen in the countr far or near.</p>
 
   <p>
 Now, there was a smart farmer, named O'Toole, whose fields
   were nearing on the McAndrews', and he had many a time set his heart on the
   fine cattle belonging to his easy-going neighbours; so when he saw them
   passing with their twenty-one cows he went out and hailed them.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Where are ye going to, this fine morning?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "It's to the Fair of Killalla we're going, to sell these
   fine cows our father gave us," they all answered together.</p>
 
   <p>
 "And are ye going to sell cows that the Evil Eye has long
   been set on ? Oh, Con and Shamus, I would never belave it of ye, even if that
   spalpeen of a Pat would do such a thing; any one would think that the spirit
   of the good mother that bore ye would stretch out a hand and kape ye from
   committing such a mortal sin."</p>
 
   <p>
 This O'Toole said to the three eldest, who stood trembling,
   while the four younger ones stuck their knuckles into their eyes and began to
   cry.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Oh, indade, Mr. O'Toole, we never knew that the cows
   were under the Evil Eye. Now did ye find it out ? Oh, sorra the day when such
   a fine lot of cattle should go to the bad," answered Con.</p>
 
   <p align="center">
 </p>
 
   <p>
 "Indade ye may well ask it, whin it's meself that was
   always a good neighbour and kept watch on auld Judy, the witch, when she used
   to stand over there laughing at the ravens flying over the cows. Do ye mind
   the time yer father spoke ugly to her down by the cross-roads ? She never
   forgot it, and now yer twenty-one fine cows will never be worth the hides on
   their hacks."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Worra, worra, worra," roared the seven McAndrews,
   so loud that pretty Katie O'Toole bobbed her head out of the window, and the
   hindermost cows began to caper like mad.</p>
 
   <p>
 "The spell has come upon them ! " cried Shamus.
   " Oh what'll we do ? What'll we do ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Hould yer whist, man alive," said O'Toole. "
   I'm a good neighbour, as I said before, so to give ye a lift in the world I'll
   take the risk on meself and buy the cows from ye for the price of their hides.
   Sure no harm can be done to the hides for making leather, so I'll give ye a
   shilling apiece, and that's better than nothing. Twenty-one bright shillings
   going to the fair may make yer fortune."</p>
 
   <p align="center">
 </p>
 
   <p>
 It seemed neck or nothing with the McAndrews, and they
   accepted the offer, thanking O'Toole for his generosity, and helped him drive
   the cows into his field Then they set off for the fair.</p>
 
   <p>
 They had never been in a fair before, and when they saw the
   fine sights they forgot all about the cows, and only remembered that they had
   each a shilling to spend.</p>
 
   <p>
 Every one knew the McAndrews, and soon a crowd gathered round
   them, praising their fine looks and telling them what a fine father they had
   to give them so much money, so that the seven omadhauns lost their heads
   entirely, and treated right and left until there wasn't a farthing left of the
   twenty-one shillings. Then they staggered home a little the worse for the fine
   whisky they drank with the boys.</p>
 
   <p>
 It was a sorry day for old McAndrew when his seven sons came
   home without a penny of the price of their twenty-one fine cows, and he vowed
   he'd never give them any more.</p>
 
   <p>
 So one day passed with another, and the seven young McAndrews
   were as happy as could be until the fine old father fell sick and died.</p>
 
   <p>
 The eldest son came in for all the father had, so he felt like
   a lord. To see him strut and swagger was a sight to make a grum growdy laugh.</p>
 
   <p>
 One day, to show how fine he could be, he dressed in his best,
   and with a purse filled with gold pieces started off for the market town.</p>
 
   <p>
 When he got there, in he walked to a public-house, and called
   for the best of everything, and to make a fine fellow of himself he tripled
   the price of everything to the landlord. As soon as he got through his eye
   suddenly caught sight of a little keg, all gilded over to look like gold, that
   hung outside the door for a sign. Con had never heeded it before, and he asked
   the landlord what it was.</p>
 
   <p>
 Now the landlord, like many another, had it in mind that he
   might as well get all he could out of a McAndrew, and he answered quickly:</p>
 
   <p>
 "You stupid omadhaun, don't you know what that is? It's a
   mare's egg."</p>
 
   <p>
 "And will a foal come out of it ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Of course ; what a question to ask a dacent man."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I niver saw one before," said the amazed McAndrew.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Well, ye see one now, Con, and take a good look at
   it."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Will ye sell it ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Och, Con McAndrew, do ye think I want to sell that fine
   egg afther kaping it so long hung up there before the sun - when it is ready
   to hatch out a foal that will be worth twenty good guineas to me?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "I'll give ye twenty guineas for it," answered Con.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Thin it's a bargain," said the landlord ; and he
   took down the keg and handed it to Con, who handed out the twenty guineas, all
   the money he had.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Be careful of it, and carry it as aisy as ye can, and
   when ye get home hang it up in the sun."</p>
 
   <p>
 Con promised, and set off home with his prize.</p>
 
   <p>
 Near the rise of a hill he met his brothers.</p>
 
   <p>
 "What have ye, Con ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "The most wonderful thing in the world-a mare's
   egg."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Faith, what is it like ? " asked Pat, taking it
   from Con.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Go aisy, can't ye? It's very careful ye have to be"</p>
 
   <p>
 But the brothers took no heed to Con, and before one could
   say, "whist," away rolled the keg down the hill, while all seven ran
   after it; but before any one could catch it, it rolled into a clump of bushes,
   and in an instant out hopped a hare.</p>
 
   <p align="center">
 </p>
 
   <p>
 "Bedad, there's the foal," cried Con, and all seven
   gave chase but there was no use trying to catch a hare.</p>
 
   <p>
 "That's the foinest foal that ever was, if he was five
   year old the devil himself could not catch him," Con said; and with that
   the seven omadhauns gave up the chase and went quietly home.</p>
 
   <p>
 As I said before, every one had it in mind to get all they
   could out of the McAndrew's.</p>
 
   <p>
 Every one said, "One man might as well have it as
   another, for they're bound to spend every penny they have."</p>
 
   <p>
 So their money dwindled away; then a fine horse would go for a
   few bits of glass they took for precious stones, and by-and-by a couple of
   pigs or a pair of fine geese for a bit of ribbon to tie on a hat ; and at last
   their land began to go.</p>
 
   <p>
 One day Shamus was sitting by his fire-place warming himself;
   and to make a good fire he threw on a big heap of turf so that by-and-by it
   got roaring hot, and instead of feeling chilly as he had before, Shamus got as
   hot as a spare-rib on a spit. Just then in came his youngest brother.</p>
 
   <p>
 "That's a great fire ye have here, Shamus."</p>
 
   <p>
 "It is, in dade, and too near it is to me ; run like a
   good boy to Giblin, the mason, and see if he can't move the chimney to the
   other side of the room."</p>
 
   <p>
 The youngest McAndrew did as he was bid, and soon in came
   Giblin, the mason.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ye're in a sad plight, Shamus, roasting alive ; what can
   I do for ye?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Can ye move the chimney over beyant ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 " Faith, I can, but ye will have to move a bit; just go
   out for a walk with yer brother, and the job will be done when ye come
   back."</p>
 
   <p>
 Shamus did as he was bid, and Giblin took the chair the
   omadhaun was sitting on and moved it away from the fire, and then sat down for
   a quiet laugh for himself and to consider on the price he'd charge for the
   job.</p>
 
   <p>
 When Shamus came back, Giblin led him to the chair, saying:</p>
 
   <p>
 "Now, isn't that a great deal better ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ye're a fine man, Giblin, and ye did it without making a
   bit of dirt ; what'll I give ye for so fine a job ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "If ye wouldn't mind, I'd like the meadow field nearing
   on mine. It's little enough for a job like that."</p>
 
   <p>
 "It's yours and welcome, Giblin ; " and without
   another word the deed was drawn.</p>
 
   <p>
 That was the finest of the McAndrew fields, and the only
   pasture land left to Shamus.</p>
 
   <p>
 It was not long before it came about that first one and then
   another lost the house he lived in, until all had to live together in the
   father's old place.</p>
 
   <p>
 O'Toole and Giblin had encroached field by field, and there
   was nothing left but the old house and a strip of garden that none of them
   knew how to till.</p>
 
   <p>
 It was hard times for the seven McAndrews, but they were happy
   and contented as long as they had enough to eat, and that they had surely, for
   the wives of the men who got away all their fine lands and cattle, had sore
   hearts when they saw their men enriched at the expense of the omadhauns, and
   every day, unbeknown to their husbands, they carried them meat and drink.</p>
 
   <p>
 O'Toole and Giblin now had their avaricious eyes set on the
   house and garden, and they were on the watch for a chance to clutch them, when
   luck, or something worse, threw the chance in the way of O'Toole.</p>
 
   <p>
 He was returning from town one day just in the cool of the
   afternoon, when he spied the seven brothers by the roadside, sitting in a
   circle facing each other.</p>
 
   <p>
 "What may ye be doing here instead of earning yer salt,
   ye seven big sturks ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "We're in a bad fix, Mr. O'Toole," answered Pat.
   "We can't get up."</p>
 
   <p>
 "What's to hinder ye from getting up? I'd like to
   know."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Don't ye see our feet are all here together in the
   middle, and not for the life of us can we each tell our own. You see if one of
   us gets up he don't know what pair of feet to take with him.'</p>
 
   <p>
 O'Toole was never so ready to laugh before in his life, but he
   thought:</p>
 
   <p>
 "Now's me chance to get the house and garden before
   Giblin, the mason, comes round; " so he looked very grave and said :
   " I suppose it is hard to tell one man's feet from another's when they're
   all there in a heap, but I think I can help you as I have many a time before.
   It would be a sorry day for ye if ye did not have me for a neighbour. What
   will ye give me if I help you find yer feet ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Anything, anything we have, so that we can get up from
   here," answered the whole seven together.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Will ye give me the house and garden?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Indade we will ; what good is a house and garden, if we
   have to sit here all the rest of our lives?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Then it's a bargain," said O'Toole; and with that
   he went over to the side of the road and pulled a good stout rod. Then he
   commenced to belabour the poor McAndrews over the heads, feet, shoulders, and
   any place he could get in a stroke, until with screeches of pain they all
   jumped up, every one finding his own feet, and away they ran."</p>
 
   <p>
 So O'Toole got the last of the property of the McAndrews, and
   there was nothing left for them but to go and beg.</p>
