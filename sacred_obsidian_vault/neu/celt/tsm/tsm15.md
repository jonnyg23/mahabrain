 <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XII</h3>
 <h1 align="CENTER">Story of Thomas the Rhymer</h1>
 <p>At the beginning of each summer, when the milk-white hawthorn is in bloom, anointing the air with its sweet odour, and miles and miles of golden whin adorn the glens and hill-slopes, the fairies come forth in grand procession, headed by the Fairy Queen. They are mounted on little white horses, and when on a night of clear soft moonlight the people hear the clatter of many hoofs, the jingling of bridles, and the sound of laughter and sweet music coming sweetly down the wind, they whisper one to another: "Tis the Fairy Folks' Raid", or "Here come the Riders of the Shee".</p>
 <p>The Fairy Queen, who rides in front, is gowned in grass-green silk, and wears over her shoulders a mantle of green velvet adorned with silver spangles. She is of great beauty. Her eyes are like wood violets, her teeth like pearls, her brow and neck are swan-white, and her cheeks bloom like ripe apples. Her long clustering hair of rich auburn gold which falls over her shoulders and</p>
 <p><a name="page_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p>
 <p>down her back, is bound round about with a snood that glints with star-like gems, and there is one great flashing jewel above her brow. On each lock of her horse's mane hang sweet-toned silver bells that tinkle merrily as she rides on.</p>
 <p>The riders who follow her in couples are likewise clad in green, and wear little red caps bright as the flaming poppies in waving fields of yellow barley. Their horses' manes are hung with silver whistles upon which the soft winds play. Some fairies twang harps of gold, some make sweet music on oaten pipes, and some sing with birdlike voices in the moonlight. When song and music cease, they chat and laugh merrily as they ride on their way. Over hills and down glens they go, but no hoof-mark is left by their horses. So lightly do the little white creatures trot that not a grass blade is broken by their tread, nor is the honey-dew spilled from blue harebells and yellow buttercups. Sometimes the fairies ride over tree-tops or through the air on eddies of western wind. The Riders of the Shee always come from the west.</p>
 <p>When the Summer Fairy Raid is coming, the people hang branches of rowan over their doors and round their rooms, and when the Winter Raid is coming they hang up holly and mistletoe as protection from attack; for sometimes the fairies steal pretty children while they lie fast asleep, and</p>
 <p><a name="page_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p>
 <p>carry them off to Fairyland, and sometimes they lure away pipers and bards, and women who have sweet singing voices.</p>
 <p>Once there was a great bard who was called Thomas the Rhymer. He lived at Ercildoune (Earlston), in Berwickshire, during the thirteenth century. It is told that he vanished for seven years, and that when he reappeared he had the gift of prophecy. Because he was able to foretell events, he was given the name of True Thomas.</p>
 <p>All through Scotland, from the Cheviot Hills to the Pentland Firth, the story of Thomas the Rhymer has long been known.</p>
 <p>During his seven years' absence from home be is said to have dwelt in fairyland. One evening, so runs the tale, he was walking alone on the banks of Leader Water when he saw riding towards him the Fairy Queen on her milk-white steed, the silver bells tinkling on its mane, and the silver bridle jingling sweet and clear. He was amazed at her beauty, and thinking she was the Queen of Heaven, bared his head and knelt before her as she dismounted, saying: "All hail, mighty Queen of Heaven! I have never before seen your equal."</p>
 <p>Said the green-clad lady: "Ah! Thomas, you have named me wrongly. I am the Queen of Fairyland, and have come to visit you."</p>
 <p><a name="page_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a></p>
 <p>"What seek you with me?" Thomas asked.</p>
 <p>Said the Fairy Queen: "You must hasten at once to Fairyland, and serve me there for seven years."</p>
 <p>Then she laid a spell upon him, and he had to obey her will. She mounted her milk-white steed and Thomas mounted behind her, and they rode off together. They crossed the Leader Water, and the horse went swifter than the wind over hill and dale until a great wide desert was reached. No house nor human being could be seen anywhere. East and west, north and south, the level desert stretched as far as eye could see. They rode on and on until at length the Fairy Queen spoke, and said: "Dismount, O Thomas, and I shall show you three wonders."</p>
 <p>Thomas dismounted and the Fairy Queen dismounted also. Said she: "Look, yonder is a narrow road full of thorns and briers. That is the path to Heaven. Yonder is a broad highway which runs across a lily lea. That is the path of wickedness. Yonder is another road. It twines round the hill-side towards the west. That is the way to Fairyland, and you and I must ride thither."</p>
 <p>Again she mounted her milk-white steed and Thomas mounted behind. They rode on and on, crossing many rivers. Nor sun or moon could be seen nor any stars, and in the silence and thick</p>
 <p><a name="page_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p>
 <p>darkness they heard the deep voice of the roaring sea.</p>
 <p>At length a light appeared in front of them, which grew larger and brighter as they rode on. Then Thomas saw a beautiful country. The horse halted and he found himself in the midst of a green garden. When they had dismounted, the Fairy Queen plucked an apple and gave it to, Thomas, saying: "This is your reward for coming with me. After you have eaten of it you will have power to speak truly of coming events, and men will know you as 'True Thomas'."</p>
 <p>Thomas ate the apple and then followed the queen to her palace. He was given clothing of green silk and shoes of green velvet, and he dwelt among the fairies for seven years. The time passed so quickly that the seven years seemed no longer than seven hours.</p>
 <p>After his return to Ercildoune, where he lived in a castle, Thomas made many songs and ballads and pronounced in rhyme many prophecies. He travelled up and down the country, and wherever he went he foretold events, some of which took place while yet he lived among men, but others did not happen until long years afterwards. There are still some prophecies which are as yet unfulfilled.</p>
 <p>It is said that when Thomas was an old man the Fairy Queen returned for him. One day, as</p>
 <p><a name="page_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a></p>
 <p>he stood chatting with knights and ladies, she rode from the river-side and called: "True Thomas, your time has come."</p>
 <p>Thomas cried to his friends: "Farewell, all of you, I shall return no more." Then he mounted the milk-white steed behind the Fairy Queen, and galloped across the ford. Several knights leapt into their saddles and followed the Rider of the Shee, but when they reached the opposite bank of the river they could see naught of Thomas and the Fairy Queen.</p>
 <p>It is said that Thomas still dwells in Fairyland, and that he goes about among the Riders of the Shee when they come forth at the beginning of each summer. Those who have seen him ride past tell that he looks very old, and that his hair and long beard are white as driven snow. At other times he goes about invisible, except when he attends a market to buy horses for a fairy army which is to take part in a great battle. He drives the horses to Fairyland and keeps them there. When he has collected a sufficient number, it is told, he will return again to wage war against the invaders of his country, whom he will defeat on the banks of the Clyde.</p>
 <p>Thomas wanders far and wide through Scotland. He has been seen, folks have told, riding out of a fairy dwelling below Eildon Hills, from another fairy dwelling below Dumbuck Hill, near Dumbarton,</p>
 <p><a name="page_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a></p>
 <p>and from a third fairy dwelling below the boat-shaped mound of Tom-na-hurich at Inverness.</p>
 <p>Once a man who climbed Dumbuck Hill came to an open door and entered through it. In a dim chamber he saw a little old man resting on his elbow, who spoke to him and said: "Has the time come?"</p>
 <p>The man was stricken with fear and fled away. When he pressed through the doorway, the door shut behind him, and turf closed over it.</p>
 <p>Another story about Thomas is told at Inverness. Two fiddlers, named Farquhar Grant and Thomas Cumming, natives of Strathspey, who lived over three hundred years ago, once visited Inverness during the Christmas season. They hoped to earn money by their music, and as soon as they arrived in the town began to show their skill in the streets. Although they had great fame as fiddlers in Strathspey, they found that the townspeople took little notice of them. When night fell, they had not collected enough money to buy food for supper and to pay for a night's lodging. They stopped playing and went, with their fiddles under their right arms, towards the wooden bridge that then crossed the River Ness.</p>
 <p>Just as they were about to walk over the bridge they saw a little old man coming towards them in the dusk. His beard was very long and very</p>
 <p><a name="page_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a></p>
 <p>white, but although his back was bent his step was easy and light. He stopped in front of the fiddlers, and, much to their surprise, hailed them by their names saying: "How fares it with you, my merry fiddlers?"</p>
 <p>"Badly, badly!" answered Grant.</p>
 <p>"Very badly indeed!" Cumming said.</p>
 <p>"Come with me," said the old man. "I have need of fiddlers to-night, and will reward you well. A great ball is to be held in my castle, and there are no musicians."</p>
 <p>Grant and Cumming were glad to get the chance of earning money by playing their fiddles and said they would go. "Then follow me and make haste," said the old man. The fiddlers followed him across the wooden bridge and across the darkening moor beyond. He walked with rapid strides, and sometimes the fiddlers had to break into a run to keep up with him. Now and again that strange, nimble old man would turn round and cry: "Are you coming, my merry fiddlers?"</p>
 <p>"We are doing our best," Grant would answer, while Cumming muttered: "By my faith, old man, but you walk quickly!"</p>
 <p>"Make haste, Grant; make haste, Cumming, the old man would then exclaim; "my guests will be growing impatient."</p>
 <p>In time they reached the big boat-shaped</p>
 <p><a name="page_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a></p>
 <p>mound called Tom-na-hurich, and the old man began to climb it. The fiddlers followed at a short distance. Then he stopped suddenly and stamped the ground three times with his right foot. A door opened and a bright light streamed forth.</p>
 <p>"Here is my castle, Cumming; here is my castle, Grant," exclaimed the old man, who was no other than Thomas the Rhymer. "Come within and make merry."</p>
 <p>The fiddlers paused for a moment at the open door, but Thomas the Rhymer drew from his belt a purse of gold and made it jingle. "This purse holds your wages," he told them. "First you will get your share of the feast, then you will give us fine music."</p>
 <p>As the fiddlers were as hungry as they were poor, they could not resist the offer made to them, and entered the fairy castle. As soon as they entered, the door was shut behind them.</p>
 <p>They found themselves in a great hall, which was filled with brilliant light. Tables were spread with all kinds of food, and guests sat round them eating and chatting and laughing merrily.</p>
 <p>Thomas led the fiddlers to a side table, and two graceful maidens clad in green came forward with dishes of food and bottles of wine, and said: "Eat and drink to your hearts' content, Farquhar Grant and Thomas Cumming--Farquhar o'Feshie</p>
 <p><a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a></p>
 <p>and Thomas o' Tom-an-Torran. You are welcome here to-night."</p>
 <p>The fiddlers wondered greatly that the maidens knew not only their personal names but even the names of their homes. They began to eat, and, no matter how much they ate, the food on the table did not seem to grow less. They poured out wine, but they could not empty the bottles.</p>
 <p>Said Cumming: "This is a feast indeed."</p>
 <p>Said Grant: "There was never such a feast in Strathspey."</p>
 <p>When the feast was ended the fiddlers were led to the ballroom, and there they began to play merry music for the gayest and brightest and happiest dancers they ever saw before. They played reels and jigs and strathspeys, and yet never grew weary. The dancers praised their music, and fair girls brought them fruit and wine at the end of each dance. If the guests were happy, the musicians were happier still, and they were sorry to find at length that the ball was coming to an end. How long it had lasted they could not tell. When the dancers began to go away they were still unwearied and willing to go on playing.</p>
 <p>Thomas the Rhymer entered the ballroom, and spoke to the fiddlers, saying: "You have done well, my merry men. I will lead you to the door, and pay you for your fine music."</p>
 <p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a></p>
 <p>The fiddlers were sorry to go away. At the door Thomas the Rhymer divided the purse of gold between them, and asked: "Are you satisfied?"</p>
 <p>"Satisfied!" Cumming repeated. "Oh, yes, for you and your guests have been very kind!"</p>
 <p>"We should gladly come back again," Grant said.</p>
 <p>When they had left the castle the fiddlers found that it was bright day. The sun shone from an unclouded sky, and the air was warm. As they walked on they were surprised to see fields of ripe corn, which was a strange sight at the Christmas season. Then they came to the riverside, and found instead of a wooden bridge a new stone bridge with seven arches.</p>
 <p>"This stone bridge was not here last night," Cumming said.</p>
 <p>"Not that I saw," said Grant.</p>
 <p>When they crossed the bridge they found that the town of Inverness had changed greatly. Many new houses had been built; there were even new streets. The people they saw moving about wore strange clothing. One spoke to the fiddlers, and asked: "Who are you, and whence come you?"</p>
 <p>They told him their names, and said that on the previous night they had played their fiddles at a great ball in a castle near the town.</p>
 <p><a name="page_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a></p>
 <p>The man smiled. Then Farquhar said: "The bridge we crossed over last evening was made of wood. Now you have a bridge of stone. Have the fairies built it for you?"</p>
 <p>The man laughed, and exclaimed, as he turned away: "You are mad. The stone bridge was built before I was born."</p>
 <p>Boys began to collect round the fiddlers. They jeered at their clothing, and cried: "Go back to the madhouse you have escaped from."</p>
 <p>The fiddlers hastened out of the town, and took the road which leads to Strathspey. Men who passed them stopped and looked back, but they spoke to no one, and scarcely spoke, indeed, to one another.</p>
 <p>Darkness came on, and they crept into an empty, half-ruined house by the wayside and slept there. How long they slept they knew not, but when they came out again they saw that the harvesting had begun. Fields were partly cut, but no workers could be seen in them, although the sun was already high in the heavens. They drank water from a well, and went on their way, until at length they reached their native village. They entered it joyfully, but were unable to find their homes. There, too, new houses had been built, and strange faces were seen. They heard a bell ringing, and then knew it was Sabbath day, and they walked towards the church. A man</p>
 <p><a name="page_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p>
 <p>spoke to them near the gate of the churchyard and said: "You are strangers here."</p>
 <p>"No, indeed, we are not strangers," Grant assured him. "This is our native village."</p>
 <p>"You must have left it long ago," said the man, "for I have lived here all my life, and I do not know you."</p>
 <p>Then Grant told his name and that of his companion, and the names of their fathers and mothers. "We are fine fiddlers," he added; "our equal is not to be found north of the Grampians."</p>
 <p>Said the man: "Ah! you are the two men my grandfather used to speak of. He never saw you, but he heard his father tell that you had been decoyed by Thomas the Rhymer, who took you to Tom-na-hurich. Your friends mourned for you greatly, but now you are quite forgotten, for it is fully a hundred years since you went away from here."</p>
 <p>The fiddlers thought that the man was mocking them, and turned their backs upon him. They went into the churchyard, and began to read the names on the gravestones. They saw stones erected to their wives and children, and to their children's children, and gazed on them with amazement, taking no notice of the people who passed by to the church door.</p>
 <p>At length they entered the church hand in hand, with their fiddles under their arms. They</p>
 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 160</font></a></p>
 <p>stood for a brief space at the doorway, gazing at the congregation, but were unable to recognize a single face among the people who looked round at them.</p>
 <p>The minister was in the pulpit. He had been told who the strangers were, and, after gazing for a moment in silence, he began to pray. No sooner did he do so than the two fiddlers crumbled into dust.</p>
 <p>Such is the story of the two fiddlers who spent a hundred years in a fairy dwelling, thinking they had played music there for but a single night.</p>
