 <p><a name="page_ix"><font size="1" color="green">p. ix</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">The Welsh Mss. Society,</h3>  
 <p>HAS been formed for the purpose of transcribing and printing the more important of the numerous Bardic and Historical Remains of Wales, still extant in the Principality, and other parts of the world, that have hitherto been allowed to continue in a state of obscurity, without any effective measures being adopted to lay their contents before the public, and secure them from the various accidents to which they are liable. In addition to the general decay which, from their perishable nature, these venerable relics have been for ages undergoing, whole collections have, within a short space of time, been destroyed by fire; and of those MSS. dispersed throughout the country, numbers known to have existed a few years ago, are now no where to be found.</p>  
 <p>Besides the interest which these ancient documents possess, as objects of antiquarian curiosity, and as contributing to the elucidation of British History, they have a claim to attention of a far more general character, as being intimately connected with the origin and progress of modern European Literature; for it is among the legends and traditions of the Welsh that many of the materials are to be found, which supplied the nations of the Continent with their earliest subjects of composition, and produced those highly imaginative works that continue to exercise so powerful an influence to the present day.</p>  
 <p>A great mass of Historical information, relating to the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries, is contained in the unpublished Poetry of Wales; from which an intimate acquaintance with the state of society during those periods may be obtained; the Welsh Bards being the Chroniclers of the times in which they lived, and their Poems chiefly addressed to the leading men of the day. Besides Poetry, there is still existing unpublished a large collection of Prose, both Historical and Legendary; persons of affluence are therefore solicited to contribute larger Donations and Subscriptions, than are required by the Rules of the Society, in order to enable the Committee to proceed with greater rapidity in carrying on the publication of Manuscripts.</p>  
 <p>The first Work that was published by this Society, was the LIBER LANDAVENSIS, or LLYFR TEILO, comprising nearly 700 Royal 8vo. pages; gratuitously edited and translated by the late Rev. W. J. Rees, M.A., F.S.A. &amp;c. Of this Work only a few Copies remain to be sold to persons becoming Members of the Society at £1 2s. 0d.--Non-members, £2 2s. 0d.</p>  
 <p>The second Work of the Society consisted of a MISCELLANEOUS SELECTION OF ANCIENT WELSH MSS. in prose and poetry, from the originals collected by the late Edward Williams, (<i>Iolo Morganwg</i>) for the purpose of forming a continuation of the Myvyrian Archaiology, and afterwards proposed to be used as materials for a New History of Wales. Edited with Notes and Translations, by his son, the late TALIESIN AB IOLO, of Merthyr Tydvil. This work is of the same size and price as the Liber Landavensis, and a few copies remain still in the hands of the Publisher.</p>  
 <p>The third Work, The HERALDIC VISITATIONS OF WALES AND ITS MARCHES, Temp. Elizabeth, and James I. in two Imperial 4to. Volumes was printed under the gratuitous and able superintendence of its Editor, the late SIR SAMUEL RUSH MEYRICK, K.H., LL.])., F.S A, &amp;c., of this Work only 240 copies were published which were all engaged by Subscribers; it is therefore out of print and has become extremely scarce.</p>  
 <p>The LIVES OF CAMBRO BRITISH SAINTS, was next published, from Ancient Welsh and Latin MSS. in the British Museum and elsewhere, comprising 680 pages Royal 8vo., and was gratuitously edited and translated by the late Rev. W. J. REES, M.A., F.S.A., &amp;c. Some copies of this Work are still to be had of the Publisher, price £1 1s. 0d. to persons becoming Members of the Society,--Non-members, £2 2s. 0d.</p>  
 <p>The ANCIENT WELSH GRAMMAR made by EDEYRN DAFOD AUR, by the command of Llywelyn ap Gruffydd, (prince of Wales from 1254 to 1282,) Rhys Vychan lord of Dynevor and Ystrad Towy; and Morgan Vychan, lord paramount of Morganwg,--together with Y PUM LLYFR KERDDWRIAETH, Or Rules of Welsh Prosody, by Simwnt Vychan, in the 15th Century. Edited with Translations and Notes, by the Rev. John Williams Ab Ithel, M.A. A few</p>  
 <p><a name="page_x"><font size="1" color="green">p. x</font></a></p>  
 <p>copies only remain on hand, to be sold at £1 1s. 0d. each,--Non-members, £2 2s. 0d.</p>  
 <p>The MEDDYGON MYDDFAI, or a Compendium of the Medical Practice of the celebrated Rhiwallon and his Sons, Cadwgan, Gruffydd, and Einion, of Myddvai, in Caermarthenshire, Physicians to Rhys Gryg, lord of Dynevor and Ystrad Towy, son of Gruffydd ap Rhys, the last Prince of South Wales, about the year 1230; from Ancient MSS. in the Library of Jesus College, Oxford, Llanover, and Tonn; accompanied by an English Translation, To the whole is annexed the curious Legend of THE LADY OF THE LAKE, called LLYN-Y-FAN, from whom the above Physicians were said to be descended, and a copious Herbal; Edited by the Rev. J. Williams ab Ithel, M.A., Rector of Llanymowddwy; Translated by John Pughe, Esq., F.R.C.S., Penhelyg, Aberdovey. Price £1 1s. 0d.</p>
