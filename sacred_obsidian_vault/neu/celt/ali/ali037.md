 <p align="CENTER">The Fenian Knights<br>
 A Legend of the West</p>
 <blockquote>THERE is a fort near the Killeries in Connemara called <i>Lis-na-Keeran. </i>One day the powerful chief that lived there invited the great Fionn Ma-Coul, with his son Oscar and a band of Fenian knights, to a great banquet. But when the guests arrived they found no chairs prepared for them, only rough benches of wood placed round the table.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>So Oscar and his father would take no place, but stood watching, for they suspected treachery. The knights, however, fearing nothing, sat down to the feast, but were instantly fixed to the benches so firmly by magic, that they could neither rise nor move.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then Fionn began to chew his thumb, from which he always derived knowledge of the future, and by his magic power he saw clearly a great and terrible warrior riding fiercely towards the fort, and Fionn knew that unless he could be stopped before crossing a certain ford, they must all die, for they had been brought to Lis-na-Keeran only to be slain by their treacherous host; and unless the warrior was killed and his blood sprinkled on the Fenian knights, they must remain fixed on the wooden benches for ever.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>So Oscar of the Lion heart rushed forth to the encounter. And he flung his spear at the mighty horseman, and they fought desperately till the setting of the sun. Then at last Oscar triumphed; victory was his; and he cut off the head of his adversary, and carried it on his spear all bleeding to the fort, where he let the blood drop down upon the Fenian knights that were transfixed by magic. On this they at once sprang up free and scatheless, all except one, for on him unhappily no blood had fallen, and so he remained fixed to the bench. His companions tried to drag him up by main force, but as they did so time skin of his thighs was left on the bench, and he was like to die.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then they killed a sheep, and wrapped the fleece round him warm from the animal to heal him. So he was cured, but ever after, strange to relate, seven stone of wool were annually shorn from his body as long as he lived.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>*</blockquote>
 <blockquote>The manner in which Fionn learned the mystery of obtaining wisdom from his thumb was in this wise.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>It happened one time when he was quite a youth that he was taken prisoner by a one-eyed giant, who at first was going to kill him, but then he changed his mind and sent him to the kitchen to mind the dinner. Now there was a great and splendid salmon broiling on the fire, and the giant said--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Watch that salmon till it is done; but if a single blister rise on the skin you shall be killed."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then the giant threw himself dowim to sleep while waiting for the dinner.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>So Fionn watched the salmon with all his eyes, but to his horror saw a blister rising on the beautiful silver skin of the fish, and in his fright and eagerness he pressed his thumb down on it to flatten it; then the pain of the burn being great, he clapped the thumb into his mouth and kept it there to, suck out the fire. When he drew it back, however, he found, to his surprise that he had a knowledge of all that was going to happen to him, and a clear sense of what he ought to do. And it came into his mind that if he put out the giant's eye with an iron rod heated in the fire, he could escape from the monster. So he heated the rod, and while the giant slept he plunged it. into his eye, and before the horrid being recovered from the shock, Fionn escaped, and was soon back safe amongst his own people, the Fenman knights; and ever after in moments of great peril and doubt, when he put his thumb into Imis mouth and sucked it, the vision of the future came on him, and he could foresee clearly whatever danger lay in his path, and know to avoid it. But it was only in such extreme moments of peril that this mystic power was granted to him. And thus he was enabled to save his own life and the lives of his chosen Fenian guard when all hope seemed well-nigh gone.</blockquote>
