 <p align="CENTER">The Fairy Changeling</p>
 <blockquote>ONE evening, a man was coming home late, and he passed a house where two women stood by a window, talking.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"I have left the dead child, in the cradle as you bid me," said one woman, "and behold here is the other child, take it and let me go;" and she laid down an infant on a sheet by the window, who seemed in a secret sleep, and it was draped all in white.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"Wait," said the other, "till you have had some food, and then take it to the fairy queen, as I promised, in place of the dead child that we have laid in the cradle by<i> </i>the nurse. 'Wait also till the moon rises, and then you shall have the payment which I promised."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>They then both turned from the window. Now the man saw that there was some devil's magic in it all. And when the women turned away he crept up close to the open window and put his hand in and seized the sleeping child and drew it out quietly without ever a sound. Then he made off as fast as he could to his own home, before the women could know anything about it, and handed the child to his mother's care. Now the mother was angry at first, but when he told her the story, she believed him, and put the baby to sleep--a lovely, beautiful boy with a face like an angel.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Next morning there was a great commotion in the village, for the news spread that the first-born son of the great lord of the place, a lovely, healthy child, died suddenly in the night, without ever having had a sign of sickness. When they looked at him in the morning, there he laid dead in his cradle, and he was shrunk and wizened like a little old man, and no beauty was seen on him any more. So great lamentation was heard on all sides, and the whole country gathered to the wake. Amongst them came the young man who had carried off the child, and when he looked on the little wizened thing in the cradle he laughed. Now the parents were angry at his laughter, and wanted to turn him out.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>But he said, "Wait put down a good fire," and they did so.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then he went over to the cradle and said to the hideous little creature, in a loud voice before all the people--</blockquote>
 <blockquote>"If you don't rise up this minute and leave the place, I will burn you on the fire; for I know might well who you are, and where you came from."</blockquote>
 <blockquote>At once the child sat up and began to grin at him; and made a rush to the door to get away; but the man caught hold of it and threw it on the fire. And the moment it felt the heat it turned into a black kitten, and flew up the chimney and was seen no more.</blockquote>
 <blockquote>Then the man sent word to his mother to bring the other child, who was found to be the true heir, the lord's own son. So there was great rejoicing, and the child grew up to be a great lord him-self, and when his time came, he ruled well over the estate; and his descendants are living to this day, for all things prospered with him after he was saved from the fairies.</blockquote>
