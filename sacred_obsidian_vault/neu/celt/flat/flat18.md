 <center><h1>Legends of the Banshee</h1></center>
   <p>
 THE family of Mac Carthy have for some generations possessed a
   small estate in the county of Tipperary. They are the descendants of a race,
   once numerous and powerful in the south of Ireland; and though it is probable
   that the property they at present hold is no part of the large possessions of
   their ancestors, yet the district in which they live is so connected with the
   name of Mac Carthy by those associations which are never forgotten in Ireland,
   that they have preserved with all ranks a sort of influence much greater than
   that which their fortune or connections could otherwise give them. They are,
   like most of this class, of the Roman Catholic persuasion, to which they
   adhere with somewhat of the pride of ancestry, blended with a something, call
   it what you will, whether bigotry, or a sense of wrong, arising out of
   repeated diminutions of their family possessions, during the more rigorous
   periods of the penal laws. Being an old family, and especially being an old
   Catholic family, they have of course their Banshee; and the circumstances
   under which the appearance,. which I shall relate, of this mysterious
   harbinger of death took place, were told me by an old lady, a near connection
   of theirs, who knew many of the parties concerned, and who, though not
   deficient in understanding or education, cannot to this day be brought to give
   a decisive opinion as to the truth or authenticity of the story. The plain
   inference to be drawn from this is, that she believes it, though she does not
   own it; and as she was a contemporary of the persons concerned - as she heard
   the account from many persons about the same period, all concurring in the
   important particulars - as some of her authorities were themselves actors in
   the scene - and as none of the parties were interested in speaking what was
   false; <i>I </i>think we have about as good evidence that the whole is
   undeniably true as we have of many narratives of modern history, which I could
   name, and which many grave and sober-minded people would deem it very great
   pyrrhonism to question. This<i>, </i>however, is a point which it is not my
   province to determine. People who deal out stories of this sort must be
   content to act like certain young politicians, who tell very freely to their
   friends what they hear at a great man's table; not guilty of the impertinence
   of weighing the doctrines, and leaving it to their hearers to understand them
   in any sense, or in no sense, just as they may please.</p>
 
   <p>
 Charles Mac Carthy was, in the year 1749, the only surviving
   son of a very numerous family. His father died when he was little more than
   twenty, leaving him the Mac Carthy estate, not much encumbered, considering
   that it was an Irish one. Charles was gay, handsome, unfettered either by
   poverty, a father, or guardians, and therefore was not, at the age of
   one-and-twenty, a pattern of regularity and virtue. In plain terms, he was an
   exceedingly dissipated - I fear I may say debauched young man. His companions
   were, as may be supposed, of the higher classes of the youth in his
   neighbourhood, and, in general, of those whose fortunes were larger than his
   own, whose dispositions to pleasure were therefore under still less
   restrictions, and in whose example he found at once an incentive and an
   apology for his irregularities. Besides, Ireland, a place to this day not very
   remarkable for the coolness and steadiness of its youth, was then one of the
   cheapest countries in the world in most of those articles which money supplies
   for the indulgence of the passions. The odious excise-man, with his portentous
   book in one hand, his unrelenting pen held in the other, or stuck beneath his
   hat-band, and the ink-bottle ('black emblem of the informer') dangling from
   his waist-coat-button - went not then from ale-house to ale-house, denouncing
   all those patriotic dealers in spirit, who preferred selling whiskey, which
   had nothing to do with English laws (but to elude them), to retailing that
   poisonous liquor, which derived its name from the British "
   Parliament," that compelled its circulation among a reluctant people. Or
   if the gauger - recording angel of the law - wrote down the peccadillo of a
   publican, he dropped a tear upon the word, and blotted it out for ever! For,
   welcome to the tables of their hospitable neighbours, the guardians of the
   excise, where they existed at all, scrupled to abridge those luxuries which
   they freely shared; and thus the competition in the market between the
   smuggler, who incurred little hazard, and the personage ycleped fair trader,
   who enjoyed little protection, made Ireland a land flowing, not merely with
   milk and honey, but with whiskey and wine. In the enjoyments supplied. by
   these, and in the many kindred pleasures to which frail youth is but too
   prone, Charles Mac Carthy indulged to such a degree, that just about the time
   when he bad completed his four-and-twentieth year, after a week of great
   excesses, he was seized with a violent fever, which, from its malignity, and
   the weakness of his frame, left scarcely a hope of his recovery. His mother,
   who had at first made many efforts to check his vices, and at last had been
   obliged to look on at his rapid progress to ruin in silent despair, watched
   day and night at his pillow. The anguish of parental feeling was blended with
   that still deeper misery which those only know who have striven hard to rear
   in virtue and piety a beloved and favourite child; have found him grow up all
   that their hearts could desire, until he reached manhood; and then, when their
   pride was highest, and their hopes almost ended in the fulfilment of their
   fondest expectations, have seen this idol of their affections plunge headlong
   into a course of reckless profligacy, and, after a rapid career of vice, hang
   upon the verge of eternity, without the leisure for, or the power of,
   repentance. Fervently she prayed that, if his life could not be spared, at
   least the delirium, which continued with increasing violence from the first
   few hours of his disorder, might vanish before death, and leave enough of
   light and of calm for making his peace with offended Heaven. After several
   days, however, nature seemed quite exhausted, and he sunk into a state too
   like death to be mistaken for the repose of sleep. His face had that pale,
   glassy, marble look, which is in general so sure a symptom that life has left
   its tenement of clay. His eyes were closed and sunk; the lids having that
   compressed and stiffened appearance which seemed to indicate that some
   friendly hand had done its last office. The lips, half-closed and perfectly
   ashy, discovered just so much of the teeth as to give to the features of death
   their most ghastly, but most impressive look. He lay upon his back, with his
   hands stretched beside him, quite motionless; and his distracted mother, after
   repeated trials, could discover not the least symptom of animation. The
   medical man who attended, having tried the usual modes for ascertaining the
   presence of life, declared at last his opinion that it was flown, and prepared
   to depart .from the house of mourning. His horse was seen to come to the door.
   A crowd of people who were collected before the windows, or scattered in
   group' on the lawn in front, gathered round when the door opened. These were
   tenants, fosterers, and poor relations of the family, with others attracted by
   affection, or by that interest which partakes of curiosity, but is something
   more, and which collects the lower ranks round a house where a human being is
   in his passage to another world. They saw the professional man come out from
   the hall door and approach his horse; and while slowly, and with a melancholy
   air, he prepared to mount, they clustered round him with enquiring and wishful
   looks. Not a word was spoken; but their meaning could not be misunderstood;
   and the physician, when he had got into his saddle, and while the servant was
   still holding the bridle, as if to delay him, and was looking anxiously at his
   face, as if expecting that he would relieve the general suspense, shook his
   head, and said in a low voice, "It's all over, James;" and moved
   slowly away. The moment he had spoken, the women present, who were very
   numerous, uttered a shrill cry, which, having been sustained for about half a
   minute, fell suddenly into a full, loud, continued and discordant but
   plaintive wailing, above which occasionally were heard the deep sounds of a
   man's voice, sometimes in broken sobs, sometimes in more distinct exclamations
   of sorrow. This was Charles's foster-brother, who moved about in the crowd,
   now clapping his hands, now rubbing them together in an agony of grief. The
   poor fellow had been Charles's playmate and companion when a boy, and
   afterwards his servant; had always been distinguished by his, peculiar regard,
   and loved his young master, as much, at least, as he did his own life.</p>
 
   <p>
 When Mrs. Mac Car thy became convinced that the blow was
   indeed struck, and that her beloved son was sent to his last account, even in
   the blossoms of his sin, she remained for some time gazing with fixedness upon
   his cold features; then, as. if something had suddenly touched the string of
   her tenderest affections, tear after tear trickled down her cheeks, pale with
   anxiety and watching. Still she continued looking at her son, apparently
   unconscious that she was weeping, without once lifting her handkerchief to her
   eyes, until reminded of the sad duties which the custom of the country imposed
   upon her, by the crowd of females belonging to the better class of the
   peasantry, who now, crying audibly, nearly filled the apartment. She then
   withdrew, to give directions for the ceremony of waking, and for supplying the
   numerous visitors of all ranks with the refreshments usual on these melancholy
   occasions. Though her voice was scarcely heard, and though no one saw her but
   the servants and one or two old followers of the family, who assisted her in
   the. necessary arrangements, every thing was conducted with the greatest
   regularity ; and though she made no effort to check her sorrows, they never
   once suspended her attention, now more than ever required to preserve order in
   her household, which, in this season of calamity, but for her would have been
   ail confusion.</p>
 
   <p>
 The night was pretty far advanced; the boisterous lamentations
   which had prevailed during part of the day in and about the house had given
   place to a solemn and mournful stillness; and Mrs. Mac Carthy, whose heart,
   notwithstanding her long fatigue and watching, was yet too sore for sleep, was
   kneeling in fervent prayer in a chamber adjoining that of her son: - suddeniy
   her devotions were disturbed by an unusual noise, proceeding from the persons
   who were watching round the body. First there was a low murmur - then al[ was
   silent, as if the movements of those in the chamber were checked by a sudden
   panic - and then a loud cry of terror burst from all within : - the door of
   the chamber was thrown open, and all who were not overturned in the press
   rushed wildly into the passage which led to the stairs, and into which Mrs.
   Mac Carthy's room opened. Mrs. Mac Carthy made her way through the crowd into
   her son's chamber, where she found him sitting up in the bed, and looking
   vacantly around, like one risen from the grave. The glare thrown upon his sunk
   features and thin lathy frame gave an unearthly horror to his whole aspect.
   Mrs. Mac Carthy was a woman of some firmness; but she was a woman, and not
   quite free fr6m the superstitions of her country. She dropped on her knees,
   and, clasping her hands, began to pray aloud. The form before her moved only
   its lips, and barely uttered " Mother;" - but though the pale lips
   moved, as if there was a design to finish the sentence, the tongue refused its
   office. Mrs. Mac Carthy sprung forward, and catching the arm of her son,
   exclaimed, "Speak in the name of God and his saints, speak! are you
   alive?"</p>
 
   <p>
 He turned to her slowly, and said, speaking still with
   apparent difficulty, " Yes, my mother, alive, and -- But sit
   down and collect yourself; I have that to tell, which will astonish you
   still more than what you have seen.? " He leaned back upon his pillow,
   and while his mother remained kneeling by the bedside, holding one of his
   hands clasped in hers, and gazing on him with the look of one who distrusted
   all her senses, he proceeded :- " Do not interrupt me until I have done.
   I wish to speak while the excitement of returning life is upon me, as I know I
   shall soon need much repose. Of the commencement of my illness I have only a
   confused recollection; but within the last twelve hours, I have been before
   the judgment-seat of God. Do not stare incredulously on me - 'tis as true as
   have been my crimes, and, as I trust, shall be my repentance. I saw the awful
   Judge arrayed in all the terrors which invest him when mercy gives place to
   justice. The dreadful pomp of offended omnipotence, I saw,- remember. It is
   fixed here; printed on my brain in characters indelible; but it passeth human
   language. What I <i>can </i>describe I <i>will </i>- I may speak it briefly.
   It is enough to say, I was weighed in the balance and found wanting. The
   irrevocable sentence was upon the point of being pronounced; the eye of my
   Almighty Judge, which had already glanced upon me, half spoke my doom; when I
   observed the guardian saint, to whom you so often directed my prayers when I
   was a child, looking at me with an expression of benevolence and compassion. I
   stretched forth my hands to him, and besought his intercession; I implored
   that one year, one month might be given to me on earth, to do penance and
   atonement for my transgressions. He threw himself at the feet of my Judge, and
   supplicated for mercy. Oh! never-not if I should pass through ten thousand
   successive states of being - never, for eternity, shall I forget the horrors
   of that moment, when my fate hung suspended - when an instant was to decide
   whether torments unutterable were to be my portion for endless ages! But
   Justice suspended its decree, and Mercy spoke in accents of firmness, but
   mildness, ' Return to that world in which thou hast lived but to outrage the
   laws of Him who made that world and thee. Three years are given thee for<i> </i>repentance;
   when these are ended, thou shalt again stand here, to be saved or lost for
   ever.' - I heard no more; I saw no more, until I awoke to life, the moment
   before you entered."</p>
 
   <p>
 Charles's strength continued just long enough to finish these
   last words, and on uttering them he closed his eyes, and lay quite exhausted.
   His mother, though, as was before said, somewhat disposed to give credit to
   supernatural visitations, yet hesitated whether or not she should believe
   that, although awakened from a swoon, which might have been the crisis of his
   disease, he was still under the influence of delirium. Repose, however, was at
   all events necessary, and. she took immediate measures that he should enjoy it
   undisturbed. After some hours' sleep, he awoke refreshed, and thenceforward
   gradually but steadily recovered.</p>
 
   <p>
 Still he persisted in his account of the vision, as he had at
   first related it; and his persuasion of its reality had an obvious and decided
   influence on his habits and conduct. He did not altogether abandon the society
   of his former associates, for his temper was not soured by his reformation;
   but he never joined in their excesses, and often endeavoured to reclaim them.
   How his pious exertions succeeded, I have never learnt; but of himself it is
   recorded, that he was religious without ostentation, and temperate without
   austerity; giving a practical proof that vice may be exchanged for virtue,
   without a loss of respectability, popularity, or happiness.</p>
 
   <p>
 Time rolled on, and long before the three years were ended,
   the story of his vision was forgotten, or, when spoken of, was<i> </i>usually
   mentioned as an instance proving the folly of believing in such things.
   Charles's health, from the temperance and regularity of his habits, became
   more robust than ever. His friends, indeed, had often occasion to rally him
   upon a seriousness and abstractedness of demeanour, which grew upon him as he
   approached the completion of his seven-and-twentieth year, but for the most
   part his manner exhibited the same animation and cheerfulness for which he had
   always been remarkable. In company, he evaded every endeavour to draw from him
   a distinct opinion on the subject of the supposed prediction; but among his
   own family it was well known that he still firmly believed it. However, when
   the day had nearly arrived on which the prophecy was, if at all, to be
   fulfilled, his whole appearance gave such promise of a long and healthy life,
   that he was persuaded by his friends to ask a large party to an entertainment
   at Spring House, to celebrate his birthday. But the occasion of this party;
   and the circumstances which attended it, will be best learned from a perusal
   of the following letters, which have been carefully preserved by some
   relations of his family. The first is from Mrs. Mac Carthy to a lady, a very
   near connection and valued friend of hers, who lived in the county of Cork, at
   about fifty miles' distance from Spring House.</p>
 
   <i>
   </i><p>
 <br>
 
   " To Mrs. Barry, Castle Barry.</p>
 
   
   <p>
 " Spring House, Tuesday morning, October 15th, 1752.</p>
 
   <p>
 "MY DEAREST MARY,</p>
 
   <p>
 "I am afraid I am going to put your affection for your
   old friend and kinswoman to a severe trial. A two days' journey at this
   season,, over bad roads and through a troubled country, it will indeed require
   friendship such as yours to persuade a sober woman to encounter. But the truth
   is, I have, or fancy I have, more than usual cause for wishing you near me.
   You know my son's story. I can't tell how it is, but as next Sunday
   approaches, when the prediction of his dream or his vision will be proved
   false or true, I feel a sickening of the heart, which I cannot suppress, but
   which your presence, my dear Mary, will soften, as it has done so many of my
   sorrows. My nephew, James Ryan, is to be married to Jane Osborne (who, you
   know, is my son's ward), and the bridal entertainment will take place here on
   Sunday next, though Charles pleaded hard to have it postponed a day or two
   longer. Would to God - but no more of this till we meet. Do prevail upon
   yourself to leave your good man for <i>one </i>week, if his farming concerns
   will not admit of his accompanying you; and come to us, with the girls, as
   soon before Sunday as you can.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ever my dear Mary's attached Cousin and friend,</p>
 
   <p>
 "ANN MAC CARTHY."</p>
 
   <p>
 <br>
 
   Athough this letter reached Castle Barry early on Wednesday, the messenger
   having travelled on foot, over bog and moor, by paths impassable to horse or
   carriage, Mrs. Barry, who at once determined on going, had so many
   arrangements to make for the regulation of her domestic affairs (which, in
   Ireland, among the middle orders of the gentry, fall soon into confusion when
   the mistress of the family is away), that she and her two younger daughters
   were unable to leave home until late on the morning of Friday. The eldest
   daughter remained, to keep her father company, and superintend the concerns of
   the household. As the travellers were to journey in an open one-horse vehicle,
   called a jaunting-car (still used in Ireland), and as the roads, bad at all
   times, were rendered still worse by the heavy rains, it was their design to
   make two easy stages; to stop about mid-way the first night, and reach Spring
   House early on Saturday evening. This arrangement was now altered, as they
   found that, from the lateness of their departure, they could proceed, at the
   utmost, no farther than twenty miles on the first day; and they therefore
   purposed sleeping at the house of a Mr. Bourke, friend of theirs, who lived at
   somewhat less than that distance from Castle Barry. They reached Mr. Bourke's
   in safety; after rather a disagreeable drive. What befel them on their journey
   the next day to Spring House, and after their arrival there, is fully related
   in a letter from the second Miss Barry to her eldest sister.</p>
 
   <p>
 <br>
 
   Spring House, Sunday evening, 20th October, 1752.</p>
 
   <p>
 "DEAR ELLEN,</p>
 
   <p>
 As my mother's letter, which encloses this will announce to
   you briefly the sad intelligence which I shall here relate more fully, I think
   it better to go regularly through the recital of the extraordinary events of
   the last two days.</p>
 
   <p>
 "The Bourkes kept us up so late on Friday night, that
   yesterday was pretty far advanced before we could begin our journey, and the
   day closed when we were nearly fifteen miles distant from this place. The
   roads were excessively deep, from the heavy rains of the last week, and we
   proceeded so slowly, that at last my mother resolved on passing the night at
   the house of Mr. Bourke's brother (who lives about a quarter of<i> </i>a mile
   off the road), and coming here to break-fast in the morning. The day had been
   windy and showery, and the sky looked fitful, gloomy, and uncertain. The moon
   was full, and at times shone clear and bright; at others, it was wholly
   concealed behind the thick, black, and rugged masses of clouds, that rolled
   rapidly along, and were every moment becoming larger, and collecting together,
   as if gathering strength for a coming storm. The wind, which blew in our
   faces, whistled bleakly along the low hedges of the narrow road, on which we
   proceeded with difficulty from the number of deep sloughs, and which afforded
   not the least shelter, no plantation being within some miles of us. My mother,
   therefore, asked Leary, who drove the jaunting-car, how far we were from Mr.
   Bourke's. ' 'T is about ten spades from this to the cross, and we have then
   only to turn to the left into the avenue, ma'am.' 'Very well, Leary: turn up
   to Mr. Bourke's as soon as you reach the cross roads.' My mother had scarcely
   spoken these words, when a shriek, that made us thrill as if our very hearts
   were pierced by it, burst from the hedge to the right of our way. If it
   resembled any thing earthly, it seemed the cry of a female, struck by a sudden
   and mortal blow, and giving out her life in one long deep pang of expiring
   agony. ' Heaven defend us!' exclaimed my mother. 'Go you over the hedge,
   Leary, and save that woman, if she is not yet dead, while we run back to the
   hut we just passed, and alarm the village near it.' 'Woman ! said Leary,
   beating the horse violently, while his voice trembled - ' that's no woman :
   the sooner we get on, ma'am, the better;' and he continued his efforts to
   quicken the horse's pace. We saw nothing. The moon was hid. It was quite dark,
   and we had been for some time expecting a heavy fall of rain. But just as
   Leary had spoken, and had succeeded in making the' horse trot briskly forward,
   we distinctly heard a loud clapping of hands, followed by a succession of
   screams, that seemed to denote the last excess of despair and anguish, and to
   issue from a person running forward inside the hedge, to keep pace with our
   progress. Still we saw nothing; until, when we were within about ten yards of
   the place where an avenue branched off to Mr. Bourke's to the left, and the
   road turned to Spring House on e right, the moon started suddenly from behind
   a cloud, and enabled us to see, as plainly as I now see this paper, the figure
   of a tall thin woman, with uncovered head, and long hair that floated round
   her shoulders, attired in something which seemed either a loose white cloak,
   or a sheet thrown hastily about her. She stood on the corner hedge, where the
   road on which we were met that which leads to Spring House, with her face
   towards us, her left hand pointing to this place, and her right arm waving
   rapidly and violently, as if to draw us on in that direction. The horse had
   stopped, apparently frightened at the sudden presence of the figure, which
   stood in the manner I have described, still uttering the same piercing cries,
   for about half a minute. It then leaped upon the road, disappeared from our
   view for one instant, and the next was seen standing upon a high wall a little
   way up the avenue, on which we purposed going, still pointing towards the road
   to Spring House, but in an attitude of defiance and command, as if prepared to
   oppose our passage up the avenue. The figure was now quite silent, and its
   garments, which had before flown loosely in the wind, were closely wrapped
   around it. ' Go on, Leary, to Spring House, in God's name,' said my mother; '
   whatever world it belongs to, we will provoke it no longer.' ' 'T is the
   Banshee, ma'am,' said Leary; 'and I would not, for what my life is worth, go
   any where this blessed night but to Spring House. But I 'm afraid there 's
   something bad going forward, or <i>she</i> would not send us there.' So
   saying, he drove forward; and as we turned on the road to the right, the moon
   suddenly withdrew its light, and we saw the apparition no more; but we heard
   plainly a prolonged clapping of hands, gradually dying away, as if it issued
   from a person rapidly retreating. We proceeded as quickly as the badness of
   the roads and the fatigue of the poor animal that drew us would allow, and
   arrived here about eleven o'clock last night. The scene which awaited us you
   have learned from my mother's letter. To explain it fully, I must recount to
   you some of the transactions which took place here during the last week.</p>
 
   <p>
 "You are aware that Jane Osborne was to have been married
   this day to James Ryan, and that they and their friends have been here for the
   last week. On Tuesday last, the very day on the morning of which cousin Mac
   Carthy despatched the letter inviting us here, the whole of the company were
   walking about the grounds a little before dinner. It seems that an unfortunate
   creature, who had been seduced by James Ryan, was<i> </i>seen prowling in the
   neighbourhood m a moody melancholy state for some days previous. He had
   separated from her for several months, and, they say, had provided for her
   rather handsomely; but she had been seduced by the promise of his marrying
   her; and the shame of her unhappy condition, uniting with disappointment and
   jealousy, had disordered her intellects. During the whole forenoon of this
   Tuesday, she had been walking in the plantations near Spring House, with her
   cloak folded tight round her, the hood nearly covering her face; and she had
   avoided conversing with or even meeting any of the family.</p>
 
   <p>
 " Charles Mac Carthy, at the time I mentioned, was
   walking between James Ryan and another, at a little distance from the rest<i>,
   </i>on a gravel path, skirting a shrubbery. The whole party were thrown into
   the utmost consternation by the report of a pistol, fired from a thickly
   planted part of the shrubbery which Charles and his companions had just
   passed. He fell instantly, and it was found that he had been wounded in the
   leg. One of the party was a medical man; his assistance was immediately given,
   and, on examining, he declared that the injury was very slight, that no bone
   was broken, that it was merely a flesh wound, and that it would certainly be
   well in a few days. ' We shall know more by Sunday,' said Charles, as he was
   carried to his chamber. His wound was immediately dressed, and so slight was
   the inconvenience which it gave, that several of his friends spent a portion
   of the evening in his apartment.</p>
 
   <p>
 "On enquiry, it was found that the unlucky shot was fired
   by the poor girl I just mentioned. It was also manifest that she had aimed,
   not at Charles, but at the destroyer of her innocence and happiness, who was
   walking beside him. After a fruitless search for her through the grounds, she
   walked into the house of her own accord, laughing, and dancing and singing
   wildly, and every moment exclaiming that she had at last killed Mr. Ryan. When
   she heard that it was Charles, and not Mr. Ryan, who was shot, she fell into a
   violent fit, out of which, after working convulsively for some time, she
   sprung to the door, escaped from the crowd that pursued her, and could never
   be taken until last night, when she was brought here, perfectly frantic, a
   little before our arrival.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Charles's wound was thought of such little consequence,
   that the preparations went forward, as usual, for the wedding entertainment on
   Sunday. But on Friday night he grew restless and feverish, and on Saturday
   (yesterday) morning felt so ill, that it was deemed necessary to obtain
   additional medical advice. Two physicians and a surgeon met in consultation
   about twelve o'clock in the day, and the dreadful intelligence was announced;
   that unless a change, hardly hoped for, took place before night, death must
   happen within twenty-four hours after. The wound, it seems, had been too
   tightly bandaged, and otherwise injudiciously treated. The physicians were
   right in their anticipations. No favourable symptom appeared, and long before
   we reached Spring House every ray of hope had vanished. The scene we witnessed
   on our arrival would have wrung the heart of a demon. We heard briefly at the
   gate that Mr. Charles was upon his death-bed. When we reached the house, the
   information was confirmed by the servant who opened the door. But just as we
   entered, we were horrified by the most appalling screams issuing from the
   staircase. My mother thought she heard the voice of poor Mrs. Mac Carthy, and
   sprung forward. We followed, and on ascending a few steps of the stairs, we
   found a young woman, in a state of frantic passion, struggling furiously with
   two men-servants, whose united strength was hardly sufficient to prevent her
   rushing up stairs over the body of Mrs. Mac Carthy, who was lying in strong
   hysterics upon the steps. This, I afterwards discovered, wag the unhappy girl
   I before described, who was attempting to gain access to Charles's room, to
   'get his forgiveness,' as she said, 'before he went. away<i> </i>to accuse her
   for having killed him.' This wild idea was mingled with another, which seemed
   to dispute with the former possession of her mind. In-one sentence she called
   on Charles to forgive her, in the next she would denounce James Ryan as the
   murderer both of Charles and her. At length she was torn away; and the last
   words I heard her scream were, 'James Ryan, 't was you killed him, and not I -
   't was you killed him, and not I.'</p>

 "Mrs. Mac Carthy, on recovering, fell into the arms of my
   mother, whose presence seemed a great relief to her. She wept - the first
   tears, I was told, that she had shed since the fatal accident. She conducted
   us to Charles's room, who,. she said, had desired to see us the moment of our
   arrival, as he found his end approaching,. and wished to devote the last hours
   of his existence to uninterrupted prayer and meditation. We found him
   perfectly calm, resigned, and even cheerful. He spoke of the awful event which
   was at hand with courage and confidence; and treated it as a doom for which he
   had been preparing ever since his former remarkable illness, and which he
   never once doubted was truly foretold to him. He bade us farewell with the air
   of one who was about to travel a short and easy journey; and we left him with
   impressions which, notwithstanding all their anguish, will, I trust, never
   entirely for-sake us.</p>

 "Poor Mrs. Mac Carthy -but I am just called away. There
   seems a slight stir in the family; perhaps ------"</p>

 The above letter was never finished. The enclosure to which it
   more than once alludes told the sequel briefly, and it is all that I have
   farther learned of this branch of the Mac Carthy family. Before the sun had
   gone down upon Charles's seven-and-twentieth birthday, his soul had gone to
   render its last account to its Creator.</p>
