 <center><h1>The Brewery of Egg-Shells</h1></center>
   <p>
 <br>
 
   IT may be considered impertinent were I to explain what is meant by a
   changeling: both Shakspeare and Spenser have already done so and who is there
   unacquainted with the Midsummer Night's Dream [Act ii. Sc. 1] and the Fairy
   Queen [Book I. canto 10].</p>
 
   <p>
 Now Mrs. Sullivan fancied that her youngest child had been
   changed by "fairies theft," to use Spenser's words, and certainly
   appearances warranted such a conclusion; for in one night her healthy,
   blue-eyeed boy had become shrivelled up into almost nothing, and never ceased
   squalling and crying. This naturally made poor Mrs. Sullivan very unhappy; and
   all the neighbours, by way of comforting her, said, that her own child was,
   beyond any kind of doubt, with the good people, and that one of themselves had
   been put in his place.</p>
 
   <p>
 Mrs. Sullivan of course could not disbelieve what every one
   told her, but she did not wish to hurt the thing; for although its face was so
   withered, and its body wasted away to a mere skeleton, it had still a strong
   resemblance to her own boy: she therefore could not find it in her heart to
   roast it alive on the griddle, or to burn its nose off with the red hot tongs,
   or to throw it out in the snow on the road side, notwithstanding these, and
   several like proceedings, were strongly recommended to her for the recovery of
   her child.</p>
 
   <p>
 One day who should Mrs. Sullivan meet but a cunning woman,
   well known about the country by the name of Ellen Leah (or Grey Ellen). She
   had the gift, however she got it, of telling where the dead were, and what was
   good for the rest of their souls; and could charm away warts and wens, and do
   a great many wonderful things of the same nature.</p>
 
   <p>
 "You're in grief this morning, Mrs. Sullivan," were the
   first words of Ellen Leah to her.</p>
 
   <p>
 "You may say that, Ellen," said Mrs. Sullivan, and good
   cause I have to be in grief, for there was my own fine child whipped off from
   me out of his cradle, without as much as by your leave, or ask your pardon,
   and an ugly dony bit of a shrivelled up fairy put in his place; no wonder then
   that you see me in grief, Ellen."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Small blame to you, Mrs. Sullivan," said Ellen Leah;
   "but are you sure 't is a fairy?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Sure !" echoed Mrs. Sullivan, " sure enough am
   I to my sorrow, and can I doubt my own two eyes? Every mother's soul must feel
   for me!"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Will you take an old woman's advice ?" said Ellen Leah,
   fixing her wild and mysterious gaze upon the unhappy mother; and, after a
   pause, she added, "but may be you'll call it foolish? "</p>
 
   <p>
 "Can you get me back my child, - my own child,
   Ellen?" said Mrs. Sullivan with great energy.</p>
 
   <p>
 "If you do as I bid you," returned Ellen Leah,
   "you'll know." Mrs. Sullivan was silent in expectation, and Ellen
   continued, " Put down the big pot, full of water, on the fire, and make
   it boil like mad; then get a dozen new laid eggs, break them, and keep the
   shells, but throw away the rest; when that is done, put the shells in the pot
   of boiling water, and you will soon know whether it is your own boy or a
   fairy. If you find that it is a fairy in the cradle, take the red hot poker
   and cram it down his ugly throat, and you will not have much trouble with him
   after that, I promise you."</p>
 
   <p>
 Home went Mrs. Sullivan, and did as Ellen Leah desired. She
   put the pot on the fire, and plenty of turf under it, and set the water
   boiling at such a rate, that if ever water was red hot-it surely was.</p>
 
   <p>
 The child was lying for a wonder quite easy and quiet in the
   cradle, every now and then cocking his eye, that would twinkle as keen as a
   star in a frosty night, over at the great fire, and the big pot upon it; and
   he looked on with great attention at Mrs. Sullivan breaking the eggs, and
   putting down the egg-shells to boil. At last he asked, with the voice of a
   very old man, " What are you doing, mammy?"</p>
 
   <p>
 Mrs.. Sullivan's heart, as she said herself, was up in her
   mouth ready to choke her, at hearing the child speak. But she contrived to put
   the poker in the fire, and to answer without making any wonder at the words,
   "I'm brewing, <i>a </i><i>vick," </i>(my
   son.)</p>
 
   <p>
 "And what are you brewing, mammy?" said the little
   imp, whose supernatural gift of speech now proved beyond question that he was
   a fairy substitute.</p>
 
   <p>
 "I wish the poker was red," thought Mrs. Sullivan;
   but it was a large one, and took a long time heating: so she determined to
   keep him in talk until the poker was in a proper state to thrust down his
   throat, and therefore repeated the question.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Is it what I'm brewing, <i>a</i> <i>vick,"
   </i>said she, you want to know?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Yes, mammy: what are you brewing ?" returned the fairy.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Egg-shells, <i>a</i> <i>vick,"
   </i>said Mrs. Sullivan.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Oh!" shrieked the imp, starting up in the cradle, and
   clapping his hands together, " I'm fifteen hundred years in the world,
   and I never saw a brewery of egg-shells before!" The poker was by this
   time quite red, and Mrs. Sullivan seizing it, ran furiously towards the
   cradle; but somehow or other her foot slipped, and she fell flat on the <i>floor,
   </i>and the poker flew out of her hand to the other
   end of the house. However, she got up, without much loss of time, and went to
   the cradle intending to pitch the wicked thing that was in it into the pot of
   boiling water, when there she saw her own child in a sweet sleep, one of his
   soft round arms rested upon the pillow his features were as placid as if their
   repose had never been disturbed, save the rosy mouth which moved with a gentle
   and regular breathing.</p>
 
   <p>
 Who can tell the feelings of a mother when she looks upon her
   sleeping child? Why should I, therefore, endeavour to describe those of Mrs.
   Sullivan at again beholding her long lost boy? The fountain of her heart
   overflowed with the excess of joy - and she wept! - tears trickled silently
   down her cheeks, no? did she strive to check them - they were tears not of
   sorrow, but of happiness.</p>
