 <center><h1>Fior Usga</h1></center>
   <p>
 A LITTLE way beyond the Gallows Green of
   Cork, and just outside the town, there is a great lough of water, where people
   in the winter go and skate for the sake of diversion; but the sport above the
   water is nothing to what is under it, for at the very bottom of this lough
   there are buildings and gardens, far more beautiful than any now to be seen,
   and how they came there was in this manner.</p>
 
   <p>
 Long before Saxon foot pressed Irish
   ground, there was a great king called Corc, whose palace stood where the lough
   now is, in a round green valley, that was just a mile about. In the middle of
   the court-yard was a spring of fair water, so pure, and so clear, that it was
   the wonder of all the world. Much did the king rejoice at having so great a
   curiosity within his palace; but as people came in crowds from far and near to
   draw the precious water of this spring, he was sorely afraid that in time it
   might become dry; so he caused a high wall to be built up round it, and would
   allow<i> </i>nobody to have the water, which was a very great loss to the poor
   people living about the palace. Whenever he wanted any for himself he would
   send his daughter to get it, not liking to trust his servants with the key of
   the well-door, fearing that they might give some away.</p>
 
   <p>
 One night the king gave a grand
   entertainment, and there were many great princes present, and lords and nobles
   without end; and there were wonderful doings throughout the palace: there were
   bonfires, whose blaze reached up to the very sky; and dancing was there, to
   such sweet music, that it ought to have waked up the dead out of their graves;
   and feasting was there in the greatest of plenty for all who came; nor was any
   one turned away from the palace gates-but "you're welcome - you're
   welcome, heartily," was the porter's salute for all.</p>
 
   <p>
 Now it happened at this grand entertainment
   there was one young prince above all the rest mighty comely to behold, and as
   tall and as straight as ever eye would wish to look on. Right merrily did he
   dance that night with the old king's daughter, wheeling here, and wheeling
   there, as light, as a feather, and footing it away to. the admiration of every
   one. The musicians played the better for seeing their dancing; and they danced
   as if their lives depended upon it. After all this dancing came the supper;
   and the. young prince was seated at table by the side of his beautiful
   partner, who smiled upon him as often as he spoke to her; and that was by no
   means so often as he wished, for he had constantly to turn to the company and
   thank them for the many compliments passed upon his fair partner and himself.</p>
 
   <p>
 In the midst of this banquet, one of the
   great lords said to King Corc, "May it. please your majesty, here is
   every thing in abundance that heart can wish for, both to eat and drink,
   except water."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Water !" said the king, mightily
   pleased at some one calling for that of which purposely there was a want:
   "water shall you have, my lord, speedily, and that of such a delicious
   kind, that I challenge all the world to equal it. Daughter," said he,
   "go fetch some in the golden vessel which I caused to be made for the
   purpose."</p>
 
   <p>
 The king's daughter, who was called Fior
   Usga, (which signifies, in English, Spring Water,) did not much like to be
   told to perform so menial a service before so many people, and though she did
   not venture to refuse the commands of her father, yet hesitated to obey him,
   and looked down upon the ground. The king, who loved his daughter very much,
   seeing this, was sorry for what he had desired her to do, but having said the
   word, he was never known to recall it ; he therefore thought of a way to make
   his daughter go speedily and fetch the water; and it was by proposing that the
   young prince her partner should go along with her. Accordingly, with a loud
   voice, he said, "Daughter, I wonder not at your fearing to go alone so
   late at night; but I doubt not the young prince at your side will go with
   you." The prince was not displeased at hearing this; and taking the
   golden vessel in one hand, with the other led the king's daughter out of the
   hall so gracefully that all present gazed after them with delight.</p>
 
   <p>
 When they came to the spring of water, in
   the courtyard of the palace, the fair Usga unlocked the door with the greatest
   care, and stooping down with the golden vessel to take some of the water out
   of the well, found the vessel so heavy that she lost her balance and fell in.
   The young prince tried in vain to save her, for the water rose and rose so
   fast, that the entire court-yard was speedily covered with it, and he hastened
   back almost in a state of distraction to the king.</p>
 
   <p>
 The door of the well being left open, the
   water, which had been so long confined, rejoiced at obtaining its liberty,
   rushed forth incessantly, every moment rising higher and higher, and was in
   the hall of the entertainment sooner than the young prince himself, so that
   when he attempted to speak to the king he was up to his neck in water. At
   length the water rose to such a height, that it filled the entire of the green
   valley. in which the king's palace stood, and so the present lough of Cork was
   formed.</p>
 
   <p>
 Yet the king and his guests were not
   drowned, as would now happen, if such an awful inundation were to take place;
   neither was his daughter, the fair Usga, who returned to the banquet hall the
   very next night after this dreadful event; and every night since the same
   entertainment and dancing goes on in the palace at the bottom of the lough,
   and will last until some one has the luck to bring up but of it the golden
   vessel which was the cause of<i> </i>all this mischief.</p>
 
   <p>
 Nobody can doubt that it was a judgment
   upon the king for his shutting up the well in the courtyard from the poor
   people : and if there are any who do not credit my story, they may go and see
   the lough of Cork, for there it is to be seen to this day; the road to Kinsale
   passes at one Bide of it; and when its waters are low and clear, the tops of
   towers and stately buildings may be plainly viewed in the bottom by those who
   have good eyesight, without the help of spectacles.</p>
