 <center><h1>The Haunted Castle</h1></center>
   <p>
 THE Christmas of 1820 I had promised to spend at Island Bawn
   Horne, in the county Tipperary, and I arrived there from Dublin on the 18th of
   December: I was so tired with travelling, that for two days after I remained
   quietly by the fireside, reading Mr. Luttrell's exquisite <i>jeu d'esprit, </i>"Advice
   to Julia."</p>
 
   <p>
 The first person I met on venturing out was old Pierce Grace,
   the smith, one of whose sons always attends me on my shooting excursions:
   " Welcome to these parts," said Pierce: " I was waiting all day
   yesterday, expecting to see your honour."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I am obliged to you, Piercy;; I was with the
   mistress."</p>
 
   <p>
 "So I heard, your honour, which made me delicate of
   asking to see you. John is ready to attend you, and he has taken count of a
   power of birds."</p>
 
   <p>
 The following morning, gun in hand, I sallied forth on a
   ramble through the country, attended by old Pierce's son John. After some
   hours' walking, we got into that winding vale, through which the Curriheen
   flows, and beheld the castle of Ballinatotty, whose base it washes, in the
   distance.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The castle is still in good preservation, and
 was once a place of some strength. It was the residence of a powerful and
 barbarous race, named O'Brian, who were the scourge and terror of the country.
 Tradition has preserved the names of three of the family: Phelim <i>lauve
 lauider </i>(with the strong hand), his son Morty <i>lauve ne fulle</i> (of the
 bloody hand), and grandson Donough <i>gontrough na thaha</i> (without mercy in
 the dark), whose atrocities threw the bloody deeds of his predecessors
 completely into the shade. Of him it is related, that in an incursion on a
 neighbouring chieftain's territories, he put all the men and children to the
 sword; and having ordered the women to be half buried in the earth, he had them
 torn in pieces by bloodhounds " Just to frighten his enemies," added
 my narrator. The deed, however, which drew down upon him the deepest execration
 was the murder of his wife, <i>Aileen na gruig buie</i> (Ellen with the yellow
 hair), celebrated throughout the country for her beauty and affability. She was
 the daughter of O'Kennedy of Lisnabonney Castle, and refused an offer of
 marriage made to her by Donough; being supported in her refusal by her brother
 Brian Oge, <i>skeul roa more</i> (the persuasive speaking) she was allowed to
 remain single by her father, and his death seemed to relieve her from the fear
 of compulsion; but in less than a month after, Brian Oge was murdered by an
 unknown hand; on which occasion Ellen composed that affecting and well-known
 keen, <i>Thaw ma cree qeen bruitha le focth </i>(My heart is sick and heavy with
 cold). As she returned from her brother's funeral, Donough waylaid the
 procession: her attendants were slaughtered, and she was compelled to become his
 wife. Ellen ultimately perished by his hand, being, it is said, thrown out of
 the bower window for having charged him with the murder of her brother. The spot
 where she fell is shown; and on the anniversary of her death (the second Tuesday
 in August) her spirit is believed to visit it.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Giving John my gun, I proceeded to examine the castle: a window
 on the south side is pointed out as the one from which Ellen was precipitated;
 but it appears more probable that it was from the battlement over it, because
 from the circumstance of there being corresponding holes in the masonry above
 and below, it is evident that the iron-work must have been let in at the time of
 building, and that it did not open.</p>
 
 <p>
 Having satisfied my curiosity, I was about to quit the room,
 when observing an opening in the south-east corner, I was tempted  to
 explore it, and found a small staircase, which led to a sleeping recess. This
 recess was occupied by a terrier and a litter of whelps. Enraged at my
 intrusion, the dam attacked me, and having no means of defence, I made a hasty
 retreat. How far the angry animal pursued me, I cannot say; for in my
 precipitate flight, as I descended the second staircase, my foot slipped, and I
 tumbled through a broad opening into what had probably been the guardroom: but
 the evil I now encountered far exceeded that from which I fled, for the floor of
 this room was in the last stage of decay: a cat could hardly have crossed it in
 safety; and the violence with which I came on it carried me through its rotten
 surface with as little opposition as I should have received from a spider's web,
 and down I plunged into the gloomy depth beneath. A number of bats, whom my
 sudden entrance disturbed, flapped their wings, and flitted round me.</p>

 When my recollection returned, a confused sound of voices struck
 my ears, and I then distinguished a female, who in a tone of the greatest
 sweetness and tenderness said, "It's not wanting - it's not wanting - the
 life's coming into him." Opening my eyes, I found my head resting in the
 lap of a peasant girl, about eighteen, who was chafing my temples. Health or
 anxiety gave a glow to her mild and expressive features, and her light brown
 hair was Simply parted on her forehead. On one side stood an old man, her
 father, with a bunch of keys, and on the other knelt John Grace<i>, </i>with a
 cup of whiskey, which she was applying to recover me. Looking round, I perceived
 that we were on the rocks near the castle, and the river was flowing at our
 feet. Various exclamations of joy followed; and the old man desiring John to
 rinse the cup, insisted on my swallowing some of the <i>"cratur," </i>which
 having done and got up, I returned my thanks, and offered a small pecuniary
 recompense, which they would not accept, " For sure and certain they would
 have gladly done <i>tin </i>times as much for his honour without fee or
 reward."</p>
 
 <p>
 I then inquired how they came to find me. "Why, as I
 thought your honour," said John Grace, " would be some time looking
 into the crooks and corners of the place, I just walked round to talk to Honny
 here; and so we were talking over matters, and Honny was just saying to me that
 the boys (meaning her brothers) were just baling the streams, and had got a can
 of large eels, and that if I thought the mistress would like them, I could take
 as many as I pleased, and welcome, when we heard a great crash of a noise. '
 What's that ?' says I. 'I suppose,' says Honny, ''tis the <i>ould</i> gray horse
 that has fallen down and is <i>kilt</i> or may be it's Paddy's Spanish dog <i>Sagur
 </i>that 's coursing about : there 's no thinking the plague he gives me -
 they're both in the turf-house, fornent us (meaning, your honour, the underpart
 of the castle that Cromwell made a breach into, and beside which the cabin
 stands).</p>
 
 <p>
 "In comes Tim Hagerty there, and then we heard a screech !
 ''Tis his honour's voice, says I; 'he has fallen through the flooring!' 'Oh! if
 he has,' says Tim, 'I'm lost and undone for ever: and didn't the Squire no later
 than last Monday week bid me build up the passage, or that somebody he said
 would be <i>kilt - and </i>sure I meant to do it tomorrow.' Well, your honour,
 we got a light, and we saw the Phookas that caused your fall all flying about,
 in the shape of bats, and there we found your honour, and the turf all over the
 place; and for sure and certain, if you hadn't first come on it, instead of the
 bones that Paddy and Mick have been gathering against the young master's
 wedding, you would have been smashed entirely. All of us were mad and distracted
 about the wicked Phookas that were in the place, and could not tell what to do;
 but Honny said to bring you out into the open air; and so we did; and there,
 your honour, by care and management, praise be to God, we brought you round
 again; but it was a desperate long time first, and myself thought it was as good
 as all over with you."</p>

 The reader, it is to he hoped, will not he able to form a
 perfect notion of the Phooka; for indistinctness, like that of an imperfectly
 remembered dream, seems to constitute its character, and yet Irish superstition
 makes the Phooka palpable to the touch. To its agency the peasantry usually
 ascribe accidental falls; and hence many rocky pits and caverns are called Poula
 Phooka, or the hole of the Phooka. A waterfall of this name, formed by the
 Liffey, is enumerated among "the sights" of the county Wicklow.</p>
 
 <p>
 An odd notion connected with the Phooka is, that the country
 people will tell their children after Michaelmas day not to eat blackberries,
 and they attribute the decay in them, which about that time commences, to the
 operation of the Phooka.</p>
