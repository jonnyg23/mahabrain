 <center><h1>The Wonderful Tune</h1></center>
   <p>
 <br>
 
   MAURICE CONNOR was the king, and that's no small word, of all
   the pipers in Munster. He could play jig and planxty without end, and
   Ollistrum's March, and the Eagle's Whistle, and the Hen's Concert, and odd
   tunes of every sort and kind. But he knew one, far more surprising than the
   rest, which had in it the power to set every thing dead or alive dancing.</p>
 
   <p>
 In what way he learned it is beyond my knowledge, for he was
   mighty cautious about telling how he came by so wonderful a tune. At the very
   first note of that tune, the brogues began shaking upon the feet of all who
   heard it - old or young it mattered not -just as if their brogues had the
   ague; then the feet began going - going - going from under them, and at last
   up and away with them, dancing like mad ! - whisking here, there, and
   everywhere, like a straw in a storm - there was no halting while the music
   lasted !</p>
 
   <p>
 Not a fair, nor a wedding, nor a patron in the seven parishes
   round, was counted worth the speaking of with out "blind Maurice and his
   pipes." His mother, poor woman, used to lead him about from one place to
   another, just like a dog.</p>
 
   <p>
 Down through Iveragh - a place that ought to be proud of
   itself for 't is Daniel O'Connell's country - Maurice Connor and his mother
   were taking their rounds. Beyond all other places Iveragh is the place for
   stormy coast and steep mountains : as proper a spot it is as an in Ireland to
   get yourself drowned, or your neck broken on the land, should you prefer that.
   But, notwithstanding, in Ballinskellig bay there is a neat bit of ground, well
   fitted for diversion, and down from it, towards the water, is a clean smooth
   piece of strand - the dead image of a calm summer's sea on a moonlight night,
   with just the curl of the small waves upon it.</p>
 
   <p>
 Here it was that Maurice's music had brought from all parts a
   great gathering of the young men and the young women - <i>O the darlints ! </i>-
   for 'twas not every day the strand of Trafraska was stirred up by the voice of
   a bagpipe. The dance began; and as pretty a rinkafadda it was as ever was
   danced. "Brave music," said every body, "and well done,"
   when Maurice stopped.</p>
 
   <p>
 "More power to your elbow, Maurice, and a fair wind in
   the bellows," cried Paddy Dorman, a hump-backed dancing-master, who was
   there to keep order. " 'Tis a pity," said he, " if we 'd let
   the piper run dry after such music; 't would be a disgrace to Iveragh, that
   didn't come on it since the week of the three Sundays." So, as well
   became him, for he was always a decent man, says he: "Did you drink,
   piper ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 " I will, sir," says Maurice, answering the question
   on the safe side, for you never yet knew piper or schoolmaster who refused his
   drink.</p>
 
   <p>
 "What will you drink, Maurice?" says Paddy.</p>
 
   <p>
 " I'm no ways particular," says Maurice; "I
   drink any thing, and give God thanks, barring <i>raw </i>water: but if 'tis
   all the same to you, mister Dorman, may be you wouldn't lend me the loan of a
   glass of whiskey."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I've no glass, Maurice," said Paddy; " I've
   only the bottle."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Let that be no hindrance," answered Maurice; my
   mouth just holds a glass to the drop; often I've tried it, sure."</p>
 
   <p>
 So Paddy Dorman trusted him with the bottle - more fool was
   he; and, to his cost, he found that though Maurice's mouth might not hold more
   than the glass at one time, yet, owing to the hole in his throat, it took many
   a filling.</p>
 
   <p>
 "That was no bad whiskey neither," says Maurice,
   handing back the empty bottle.</p>
 
   <p>
 "By the holy frost, then !" says Paddy, " 'tis
   but <i>could </i>comfort there's in that bottle now; and 'tis your word we
   must take for the strength of the whiskey, for you've left us no sample to
   judge by :" and to be sure Maurice had not.</p>
 
   <p>
 Now I need not tell any gentleman or lady with common
   understanding, that if he or she was to drink an honest bottle of whiskey at
   one pull, it is not at all the same thing as drinking a bottle of water; and
   in the whole course of my life, I never knew more than five men who could do
   so without being overtaken by the liquor. Of these Maurice Connor was not one,
   though he had a stiff head enough of his own - he was fairly tipsy.</p>
 
   <p>
 Don't think I blame him for it; 'tis often a good man's case;
   but true is the word that says, "when liquor's in sense is out;" and
   puff, at a breath, before you could say " Lord, save us!" out he
   blasted his wonderful tune.</p>
 
   <p>
 'Twas really then beyond all belief or telling the dancing.
   Maurice himself could not keep quiet; staggering now on one leg, now on the
   other, and rolling about like a ship in a cross sea, trying to humour the
   tune. There was his mother too, moving her old bones as light as the youngest
   girl of them all: but her dancing, no, nor the dancing of all the rest, is not
   worthy the speaking about to the work that was going on down upon the strand.
   Every inch of it covered with all manner of fish jumping and plunging about to
   the music, and every moment more and more would tumble in out of the water,
   charmed by the wonderful tune. Crabs of monstrous size spun round and round on
   one claw with the nimbleness of a dancing-master, and twirled and tossed their
   other claws about like limbs that did not belong to them. It was a sight
   surprising to behold. But perhaps you may have heard of father Florence Conry,
   a Franciscan friar, and a great Irish poet; <i>bolg an dana</i>, as they used
   to call him - a wallet of poems. If you have not, he was as pleasant a man as
   one would wish to drink with of a hot summer's day; and he has rhymed out all
   about the dancing fishes so neatly, that it would be a thousand pities not to
   give you his verses ; so here's my hand at an upset of them into English:</p>
 
   <p>
 The big seals in motion,<br>
 
   Like waves of the ocean<br>
 
   Or gouty feet prancing,<br>
 
   Came heading the gay fish,<br>
 
   Crabs, lobsters, and cray fish,<br>
 
   Determined on dancing.</p>
 
   <p>
 The sweet sounds they follow'd,<br>
 
   The gasping cod swallow'd;<br>
 
   'T was wonderful, really !<br>
 
   And turbot and flounder,<br>
 
   'Mid fish that were rounder,<br>
 
   Just caper'd as gaily.</p>
 
   <p>
 John-dories came tripping;<br>
 
   Dull hake by their skipping<br>
 
   To frisk it seem'd given;<br>
 
   Bright mackrel went springing,<br>
 
   like small rainbows winging<br>
 
   Their flight up to heaven.</p>
 
   <p>
 The whiting and haddock<br>
 
   Left salt water paddock<br>
 
   This dance to be put in:<br>
 
   Where skate with flat faces<br>
 
   Edged out some odd plaices;<br>
 
   But soles kept their footing.</p>
 
   <p>
 Sprats and herrings in powers<br>
 
   Of silvery showers<br>
 
   All number out-number'd.<br>
 
   And great ling so lengthy<br>
 
   Were there in such plenty<br>
 
   The shore was encumber'd.</p>
 
   <p>
 The scollop and oyster<br>
 
   Their two shells did roister,<br>
 
   Like castanets fitting;<br>
 
   While limpets moved clearly,<br>
 
   And rocks very nearly<br>
 
   With laughter were splitting.</p>
 
   <p>
  </p>
 
   <p>
 Never was such an ullabulloo in this world, before or since;
   'twas as if heaven and earth were coming together; and all out of Maurice
   Connor's wonderful tune !</p>
 
   <p>
 In the height of all these doings, what should there be
   dancing among the outlandish set of fishes but a beautiful young woman - as
   beautiful as the dawn of day I She had a cocked hat upon her head; from under
   it her long green hair - just the colour of the sea - fell down behind,
   without hinderance to her dancing. Her teeth were like rows of pearl; her lips
   for all the world looked like red coral; and she had an elegant gown, as white
   as the foam of the wave, with little rows of purple and red sea weeds settled
   out upon it: for you never yet saw a lady, under the water or over the water,
   who had not a good notion of dressing herself out.</p>
 
   <p>
 Up she danced at last to Maurice, who was flinging his feet
   from under him as fast as hops - for nothing in this world could keep still
   while that tune of his was going on - and says she to him, chaunting it out
   with a voice as sweet as honey -</p>
 
   <p>
 " I'm a Iady of honour<br>
 
   Who live in the sea;<br>
 
   Come down, Maurice Connor,<br>
 
   And be married to me.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Sliver plates and gold dishes<br>
 
   You shall have, and shall be<br>
 
   The king of the fishes,<br>
 
   When you 're married to me." </p>
 
   <p>
 Drink was strong in Maurice's head, and out he chaunted in
   return for her great civility. It is not every lady, may be, that would be
   after making such an offer to a blind piper; therefore 'twas only right in him
   to give her as good as she gave herself - so says Maurice,</p>
 
   <p>
 I'm obliged to you, madam :<br>
 
   Off a gold dish or plate,<br>
 
   If a king, and I had 'em,<br>
 
   I could dine in great state.</p>
 
   <p>
 With your own father's daughter<br>
 
   I'd be sure to agree;<br>
 
   But to drink the salt water<br>
 
   Wouldn't do so with me ! "</p>
 
   <p>
 The lady looked at him quite amazed, and swinging her head
   from side to side like a great scholar, "Well," says she, "
   Maurice, if you're not a poet, where is poetry to be found?"</p>
 
   <p>
 In this way they kept on at it, framing high compliments; one
   answering the other, and their feet going with the music as fast as their
   tongues. All the fish kept dancing too: Maurice heard the clatter, and was
   afraid to stop playing lest it might be displeasing to the fish, and not
   knowing what so many of them may take it into their heads to do to him if they
   got vexed.</p>
 
   <p>
 Well, the lady with the green hair kept on coaxing of Maurice
   with soft speeches, till at last she overpersuaded him to promise to marry
   her, and be king over the fishes, great and small. Maurice was well fitted to
   be their king, if they wanted one that could make them dance; and he surely
   would drink, barring the salt water, with any fish of them all.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 When Maurice's mother saw him, with that
 unnatural thing in the form of a green-haired lady as his guide, and he and she
 dancing down together so lovingly: to the water's edge, through the thick of the
 fishes, she called out after him to stop and come back. "Oh then,"
 says she, "as if I was not widow enough before, there he is going away from
 me to be married to that scaly woman. And who knows but 'tis grandmother I may
 be to a hake or a cod - Lord help and pity me, but 'tis a mighty unnatural
 thing! - and may be 'tis boiling and eating my own grandchild I'll be, with a
 bit of salt butter, and I not knowing it ! - Oh Maurice, Maurice, if there's any
 love or nature left in you, come back to your own <i>ould</i> mother, who reared
 you like a decent Christian ! "</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Then the poor woman began to cry and ullagoane so finely that it
 would do any one good to hear her.</p>
 
 <p>
 Maurice was not long getting to the rim of the water; there he
 kept playing and dancing on as if nothing was the matter, and a great thundering
 wave coming in towards him' ready to swallow him up alive; but as he could not
 see it, he did not fear it. His mother it was who saw it plainly through the big
 tears that were rolling down her cheeks; and though she saw it, and her heart
 was aching as much as ever mother's heart ached for a son, she kept dancing,
 dancing, all the time for the bare life of her. Certain it was she could not
 help it, for Maurice never stopped playing that wonderful tune of his.</p>
 
 <p>
 He only turned the bothered ear to the sound of his mother's
 voice, fearing it might put him out in his steps, and all the answer be made
 back was - "Whisht with you, mother - sure I'm going to be king over the
 fishes down in the sea, and for a token of luck, and a sign that I'm alive and
 well, I'll send you in, every twelvemonth on this day, a piece of burned wood to
 Trafraska." Maurice had not the power to say a word more, for the strange
 lady with the green hair seeing the wave just upon them, covered him up with
 herself in a thing like a cloak with a big hood to it, and the wave curling over
 twice as high as their heads, burst upon the strand, with a rush and a roar that
 might be heard as far as Cape Clear.</p>
 
 <p>
 That day twelvemonth the piece of burned wood came ashore in
 Trafraska., It was a queer thing for Maurice to think of sending all the way
 from the bottom of the sea. A gown or a pair of shoes would have been something
 like a present for his poor mother; but he had said it, and he kept his word.
 The bit of burned wood regularly came ashore on the appointed day for as good,
 ay, and better than a hundred years. The day is now forgotten, and may be that
 is the reason why people say how Maurice Connor has stopped sending the
 luck-token to his mother. Poor woman, she did not live to get as much as one of
 them; for what through the loss of Maurice, and the fear of eating her own
 grandchildren, she died in three weeks after the dance - some say it was the
 fatigue that killed her, but whichever it was, Mrs. Connor was decently buried
 with her own people.</p>
 
 <p>
 Seafaring men have often heard, off the coast of Kerry, on a
 still night, the sound of music coming up from the water; and some, who have had
 good ears, could plainly distinguish Maurice Connor's voice singing these words
 to his pipes: -</p>
 
 <p>
 Beautiful shore, with thy spreading strand,<br>
 
 Thy crystal water, and diamond sand;<br>
 
 Never would I have parted from thee<br>
 
 But <i>for </i>the sake of my fair ladie.[a]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <p>
 [a] This is almost a literal translation of a Rann in the
 well-known song of Deardra.</p>
