 <center><h1>Clough na Cuddy</h1></center>
   <p>
 ABOVE all the islands in the lakes of
   Killarney give me Inniafallen -- " sweet Innisfallen," as the
   melodious Moore calls it. It is, in truth, a fairy isle, although I have no
   fairy story to tell you about it; and if I had, these are such unbelieving
   times, and people of late have grown so sceptical, that they only smile at my
   stories and doubt them.</p>
 
   <p>
 However, none will doubt that a monastery
   once stood upon Innisfallen Island, for its ruins may still be seen; neither,
   that within its walls dwelt certain pious and learned persons called monks. A
   very pleasant set of fellows they were, I make not the smallest doubt; and I
   am sure of this, that they had a very pleasant spot to enjoy themselves in
   after dinner -- the proper time, believe me, and I am no bad judge of such
   matters, for the enjoyment of a fine prospect.</p>
 
   <p>
 Out of all the monks you could not pick a
   better fellow nor a merrier soul than Father Cuddy; he sung a good song, he
   told a good story, and had a jolly, comfortable-looking paunch of his own,
   that was a credit to any refectory-table. He was distinguished above all the
   rest by the name of "the fat father." Now, there are many that will
   take huff at a name; but Father Cuddy had no nonsense of that kind about him;
   he laughed at it -- and well able he was to laugh, for his mouth nearly
   reached from one ear to the other; his might, in truth, be called an open
   countenance. As his paunch was no disgrace to his food, neither was his nose
   to his drink. 'Tis a doubt to me if there were not more carbuncles upon it
   than ever were seen at the bottom of the lake, which is said to be full of
   them. His eyes had a right merry twinkle in them, like moonshine dancing on
   the water; and his cheeks had the roundness and crimson glow of ripe arbutus
   berries.</p>
 
       <p>
 "He ate, and drank, and prayed,
       and slept. What then?<br>
 
       He ate, and drank, and prayed, and slept again!"</p>
 
   <p>
 Such was the tenor of his simple life; but
   when he prayed, a certain drowsiness would come upon him, which it must be
   confessed, never occurred when a well-filled "black jack" stood
   before him. Hence his prayers were short and his draughts were long. The world
   loved him, and he saw no good reason why he should not in return love its
   venison and its usquebaugh. But as times went, he must have been a pious man,
   or else what befell him never would have happened.</p>
 
   <p>
 Spiritual affairs -- for it was respecting
   the importation of a tun of wine into the island monastery -- demanded the
   presence of one of the brotherhood of Innisfallen at the abbey of Irelagh, now
   called Mucruss. The superitendence of this important matter was committed to
   Father Cuddy, wo felt too deeply interested in the future welfare of any
   community of which he was a member, to neglect or delay such mission. With the
   morning's light he was seen guiding his shallop across the crimson waters of
   the lake towards the peninsula of Mucross; and having moored his little bark
   in safety beneath the shelter of a wave-worn rock, he advanced with becoming
   dignity towards the abbey.</p>
 
   <p>
 The stillness of the bright and balmy hour
   was broken by the heavy footsteps of the zealous father. At the sound the
   startled deer, shaking the dew from their sides, sprung up from their lair,
   and as they bounded off -- "Hah!" exclaimed Cuddy, "what a
   noble haunch goes there! How delicious I would look smoking upon a goodly
   platter!"</p>
 
   <p>
 As he proceeded, the mountain-bee hummed
   his tune of gladness around the holy man, save when buried in the
   foxglove-bell, or revelling upon a fragrant bunch of thyme; and even then, the
   little voice murmured out happiness in low and broken tones of voluptuous
   delight. Father Cuddy derived no small comfort from the sound, for it presaged
   a good metheglin season, and metheglin he regarded, if well manufactured, to
   be no bad liquor, particularly when there was no stint of usquebaugh in the
   brewing.</p>
 
   <p>
 Arrived within the abbey garth, he was
   received with due respect by the brethren of Irelagh, and arrangements for the
   embarkation of the wine were completed to his entire satisfaction.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Welcome, Father Cuddy!" said the
   prior; "grace be on you."<br>
 
   "Grace before meat then, then," said Cuddy, "for a long walk
   always makes me hungry, and I am certain I have not walked less than half a
   mile this morning, to say nothing of crossing the water."</p>
 
   <p>
 A pasty of choice flavour felt the truth of
   this assertion as regarded Father Cuddy's appetite. After such consoling
   repast, it would have been a reflection on monastic hospitality to depart
   without partaking of the grace-cup; moreover, Father Caddy had a particular
   respect for the antiquity of that custom. He liked the taste of the grace-cup
   well: be tried another -- it was no, less excellent; and when he had
   swallowed the third, he found his heart expand and put forth its fibres,
   willing to embrace all mankind. Surely, then, there is Christian love and
   charity in wine !</p>
 
   <p>
 I said he sung a good song. Now, though
   psalms are good songs, and in accordance with his vocation, I did not mean to
   imply that he was a mere psalm-singer. It was well known to the brethren, that
   wherever Father Cuddy was, mirth and melody were with him -- mirth in his eye
   and melody on his tongue, and these, from experience, are equally well known
   to be thirsty commodities; but he took good care never to let them run dry. To
   please the brotherhood, whose excellent wine pleased him, he sung, and as in <i>vino</i>
   <i>veritas</i>, his song will well become this veritable history.</p>

   <p align="CENTER">
 THE FRIARS SONG</p>
 
   <p>
  </p>
 
   <p>
 My VOWS I can never fulfil, until I have
   breakfasted, one way or other; and I freely protest that I can never rest till
   I borrow or beg an egg, unless I can come at the ould hen, its mother. But
   Maggy, my dear, while you're here, I don't fear to want eggs that have
   just been laid newly; for och ! you're a pearl of a girl, and you're
   called so in <i>Latin</i> most truly.</p>
 
   <p>
 There is most to my mind something that is
   still upper than supper, tho' it must be admitted I feel no way thinner
   after dinner; but soon as I hear the cock crow in the morning, that eggs you
   are bringing full surely I know, by that warning, while your buttermilk helps
   me to float down my throat those sweet cakes made of oat. I don't envy an
   earl, sweet girl, och ! 'tis you are a beautiful pearl.</p>
 
   <p>
 Such was his song. Father Cuddy smacked his
   lips at the recollection of Margery's delicious fried eggs, which always
   imparted a peculiar relish to his liquor. The very idea provoked Caddy to
   raise the cup to his mouth, and with one hearty pull thereat he finished its
   contents.</p>
 
   <p>
 This is, and ever was, a censorious world,
   often construing what is only a fair allowance into an excess; but I scorn to
   reckon up any man's drink, like an unrelenting host; therefore, I cannot
   tell how many brimming draughts of wine, bedecked with the <i>venerable Bead</i>,
   Father Cuddy emptied into his "soul-case," so he figuratively termed
   the body.</p>
 
   <p>
 His respect for the goodly company of the
   monks of Irelagh detained him until their adjournment to vespers, when he set
   forward on his return to Innisfallen. Whether his mind was occupied in
   philosophic contemplation, or wrapped in pious musings, I cannot declare, but
   the honest father wandered on in a different direction from that in which his
   shallop lay. Far be it from me to insinuate that the good liquor which he had
   so commended caused him to forget his road, or that his track was irregular
   and unsteady. Oh, no! He carried his drink bravely, as became a decent man and
   a good Christian; yet, somehow, he thought he could distinguish two moons.
   "Bless my eyes," said Father Cuddy, "everything is changing
   nowadays ! -- the very stars are not in the same places they used to be; I
   think <i>Camcéachta</i> (the Plough) is driving on at a rate I never saw it
   before to-night; but I suppose the driver is drunk, for there are blackguards
   everywhere."</p>
 
   <p>
 Cuddy had scarcely uttered these words when
   he saw, or fancied he saw, the form of a young woman, who, holding up a
   bottle, beckoned him towards her. The night was extremely beautiful, and the
   white dress of the girl floated gracefully in the moonlight as with gay step
   she tripped on before the worthy father, archly looking back upon him over her
   shoulder.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ah, Margery -- merry Margery !"
   cried Cuddy; "you tempting little rogue !</p>
 
       <p>
 " 'Flos valium harum,<br>
 
       Decus puellarum,<br>
 
       Candida Margarita.'</p>
 
   <p>
 I see you; I see you and the bottle ! Let
   me but catch you, candida Margarita!" and on he followed, panting and
   smiling, after this alluring apparition.</p>
 
   <p>
 At length his feet grew weary and his
   breath failed, which obliged him to give up the chase; yet such was his piety,
   that unwilling to rest in any attitude but that of prayer, down dropped Father
   Cuddy on his knees. Sleep, as usual, stole upon his devotions; and the morning
   was far advanced when he awoke from dreams, in which tables groaned beneath
   their load, of viands, and wine poured itself free and sparkling as the
   mountain spring.</p>
 
   <p>
 Rubbing his eyes, ho looked about him, and
   the more he looked the more he wondered at the alteration which appeared in
   the face of the country. "Bless my soul and body!" said the good
   father, "I saw the stars changing last night, but here is a change!"
   Doubting his senses, he looked again. The hills bore the same majestic outline
   as on the preceding day, and the lake spread itself beneath his view in the
   same tranquil beauty, and studded with the same number of, islands; but every
   smaller feature in the landscape was strangely altered. What had been naked
   rocks, were now clothed with holly and arbutus. Whole woods had disappeared,
   and waste places had become cultivated fields; and to complete the work of
   enchantment, the very season itself seemed changed. In the rosy dawn of a
   summer's morning he had left the monastery of Inuisfallen, and he now felt
   in every sight and sound the dreariness of winter. The hard ground was covered
   with withered leaves; icicles depended from leafless branches; he beard the
   sweet, low note of the robin, who familiarly approached him; and he felt his
   fingers numbed from the nipping frost. Father Cuddy found it rather difficult
   to account for such sudden transformations, and to convince himself it was not
   the illusion of a dream, he was about to arise, when lo ! he discovered that
   both his knees were buried at least six inches in the solid stone; for
   notwithstanding all these changes, he had never altered his devout position.</p>
 
   <p>
 Cuddy was now wide awake, and felt, when he
   got up, his joints sadly cramped, which it was only natural they should be,
   considering the bard texture of the stone and the depth his knees had sunk
   into it. But the great difficulty was to explain how, in one night, summer had
   become winter, whole woods had been cut down, and well - grown trees bad
   sprouted up. The miracle -- nothing else could he conclude it to be --urged
   him to hasten his return to Innisfallen, where he might learn some explanation
   of these marvellous events.</p>
 
   <p>
 Seeing a boat moored within reach of the
   shore, he delayed not, in the midst of such wonders, to seek his own bark, but
   seizing the oars, pulled stoutly towards the island; and 'here new wonders
   awaited him.</p>
 
   <p>
 Father Caddy waddled, as fast as cramped
   limbs could carry his rotund corporation, to the gate of the monastery, where
   he loudly demanded admittance.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Holloa! whence come you, Master Monk,
   and what's your business?" demanded a stranger who occupied the porter's
   place.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Business ! --my business !"
   repeated the confounded Cuddy. "Why, do you not know me ? Has the wine
   arrived safely?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Hence, fellow!" said the porter's
   representative, in a surly tone; "nor think to impose on me with your
   monkish tales."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Fellow !" exclaimed the father.
   "Mercy upon us, that I should be so spoken to at the gate of my own
   house! Scoundrel!" cried Cuddy, raising his voice, "do you not see
   my garb -- my holy garb?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Aye, fellow," replied he of the
   keys -- " the garb of laziness and filthy debauchery, which has been
   expelled from out these walls. Know you not, idle knave, of the suppression of
   this nest of superstition, and that the abbey lands and possessions were
   granted in August last to Master Robert Collam, by our Lady Elizabeth,
   sovereign queen of England, and paragon of all beauty -- whom God preserve
   !"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Queen of England!" said Cuddy.
   "There never was a sovereign queen of England -- this is but a piece
   with the rest. I saw how it was going with the stars last night -- the world's
   turned upside down. But surely this is Innisfallen Island, and I am the Father
   Cuddy who yesterday morning went over to the abbey of Irelagh respecting the
   tun of wine. Do you not know me now?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Know you! How should I know
   you?" said the keeper of the abbey. "Yet, true it is, that I have
   beard my grandmother, whose mother remembered the man, often speak of the fat
   Father Caddy of Innisfallen, who made a profane and godless ballad in praise
   of fresh eggs, of which he and his vile crew knew more than they did of the
   Word of God; and who, being drunk, it is said, tumbled into the lake one night
   and was drowned; but that must have been a hundred -- aye, more than a
   hundred years since."</p>
 
   <p>
 "'Twas I who composed that song in
   praise of Margery's fresh eggs, which is no profane and godless ballad --
   no other Father Cuddy than myself ever belonged to Innisfallen,"
   earnestly exclaimed the holy man. "A hundred years! What was your
   great-grandmother's name?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "She was a Mahony of Dunlow --
   Margaret ni Mahony; and my grandmother -- "</p>
 
   <p>
 "What! merry Margery of Dunlow your
   great-grandmother !" shouted Cuddy. "St. Brandon help me ! the
   wicked wench with that tempting bottle! Why, 'twas only last night -- a
   hundred years ! -- your great-grandmother, said you? God bless us! there has
   been a strange torpor over me; I must have slept all this time!"</p>
 
   <p>
 That Father Cuddy had done so, I think is
   sufficiently proved by the changes which occurred during his nap. A
   reformation, and a serious one it was for him, had taken place. Pretty Margery's
   fresh eggs were no longer to be had in Innisfallen; and with a heart as heavy
   as his footsteps, the worthy man directed his course towards Dingle, where he
   embarked in a vessel on the point of sailing for Malaga. The rich wine of that
   place had of old impressed him with a high respect for its monastic
   establishments, in one of which he quietly wore out the remainder of his days.</p>
 
   <p>
 The stone impressed with the mark of Father
   Caddy's kneee may be seen to this day. Should any incredulous persons doubt
   my story, I request them to go to Killarney where Clough-na-Cuddy -- so is
   the stone called -- remains in Lord Kenmare's park, an indisputable
   evidence of the fact. Spillane the bugle-man, will be able to point it out to
   them, as be did so to me.</p>
