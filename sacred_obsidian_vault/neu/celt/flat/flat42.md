 <center><h1>Linn-Na-Payshtha</h1></center>
   <p>
 TRAVELLERS go to Leinster to see Dublin and
   the Dargle; to Ulster, to see the Giant's Causeway, and, perhaps, to do
   penance at Lough Dearg; to Munster, to see Killarney, the beautiful city of
   Cork, and half a dozen other fine things; but whoever thinks of the fourth
   province ? - whoever thinks of going -</p>
 
   <p>
 - "westward, where Dick Martin <i>ruled<br>
 
   </i>The houseless wilds of Cunnemara ?"</p>
 
   <p>
 The Ulster-man's ancient denunciation
   "to Hell or to Connaught," has possibly led to the supposition that
   this is a sort of infernal place above ground - a kind of terrestrial
   Pandemonium - in short, that Connaught is little better than hell, or hell
   little worse than Connaught; but let any one only go there for a month, and,
   as the natives say, " I 'II warrant he'll soon see the differ, and learn
   to understand that it is mighty like the rest o'green Erin, only something
   poorer;" and yet it might be thought that in this particular worse would
   be needless;" but so it is.</p>

 "My gracious me," said the
   landlady of the Inn at Sligo, " I wonder a gentleman of your <i>teest</i>
   and <i>curosity </i>would think of leaving Ireland without making a <i>tower </i>(tour)
   of Connaught, if it was nothing more than spending a day at Hazlewood, and up
   the lake, and on to the <i>ould </i>abbey at Friarstown, and the castle at
   Dromahair."</p>
 
   <p>
 Polly M'Bride, my kind hostess, might not
   in this remonstrance have been altogether disinterested; but her advice
   prevailed, and the dawn of the following morning found me in a boat on the
   unruffled surface of Lough Gill. Arrived at the head of that splendid sheet of
   water, covered with rich and wooded islands with their ruined buildings, and
   bounded by towering mountains, noble plantations, grassy slopes, and
   precipitous rocks, which give beauty, and, in some places, sublimity to its
   shores, I proceeded at once up the wide river which forms its principal
   tributary. The "ould abbey" is chiefly remarkable for having been
   built at a period nearer to the Reformation than any other. ecclesiastical
   edifice of the same class. Full within view of it, and at the distance of half
   a mile, stands the shattered remnant of Breffni's princely hall. I strode
   forward with the enthusiasm of an antiquary, and the high-beating heart of a
   patriotic Irishman. I felt myself on classic ground, immortalised by the lays
   of Swift and of Moore. I pushed my way into the hallowed precincts of the
   grand and venerable edifice. I entered its chambers, and, oh my countrymen, I
   found them converted into the domicile of pigs, cows, and poultry ! But the
   exterior of " O'Rourke's old hall," grey, frowning, and ivy-covered,
   is well enough, it stands on a beetling precipice, round which a noble river
   wheels its course. The opposite bank is a very steep ascent, thickly wooded,
   and rising to a height of at least seventy feet; and, for a quarter of a mile,
   this beautiful copse follows the course of the river.</p>

 The first individual I encountered was an
   old cowherd; nor was I unfortunately in my cicerone, for he assured me there
   were plenty of old stories about strange things that used to be in the place;
   "but," continued he, "for my own share, I never met any thing
   worse nor myself. If it bees ould stories that your honour's after, the story
   about Linn-na- Payshtha and Poul-maw-Gullyawn is the only thing about this
   place that's worth one jack-straw. Does your honour see that great big black
   hole in the river yonder below?" He pointed my attention to a part of the
   river about fifty yards from the old hall, where a long island occupied the
   centre of the wide current, the water at one side running shallow, and at the
   other assuming every appearance of unfathomable depth. The spacious pool, dark
   and still, wore a deathlike quietude of surface. It looked as if the speckled
   trout would shun its murky precincts - as if even the daring pike would shrink
   from so gloomy a dwelling-place. " That's Linn-na-Payshtha, sir,"
   resumed my guide, " and Poul-maw-Gullyawn is just the very <i>moral </i>of
   it, only that it's round, and not in a river, but standing out in the middle
   of a green field, about a short quarter of a mile from this. Well, 'tis as
   good as fourscore years - I often <i>hard</i> my father, God be merciful to
   him tell the story - since Manus O'Rourke, a great buckeen, a cock-fighting,
   drinking blackguard that was long ago, went to sleep one night and had a dream
   about Linn-na-Payshtha. This Manus, the dirty spalpeen, there was no ho with
   him; he thought to ride rough-shod over his betters through the whole country,
   though he was not one of the real stock of the O'Rourkes. Well, this fellow
   had a dream that if he dived in Linn-na-Payshtha at twelve o'clock of a
   Hollow-eve night, he'd find more gold than would make a man of him and his
   wife, while grass grew or water ran. The next night he had the same dream, and
   sure enough if he had it the second night, it came to him the third in the
   same form. Manus, well becomes him, never told mankind or womankind, but swore
   to himself, by all the books that ever were shut or open, that, any how, he
   would go to the bottom of the big hole. What did he care for the Payshtha-more
   that was lying there to keep guard on the gold and silver of the old ancient
   family that was buried there in the wars, packed up in the brewing-pan? Sure
   he was as good an O'Rourke as the best of them, taking care to forget that his
   grandmother's father was a cow-boy to the earl O'Donnel. At long last
   Hollow-eve comes, and sly and silent master Manus creeps to bed early, and
   just at midnight steals down to the river side. When he came to the bank his
   mind misgave him, and he wheeled up to Frank M'Clure's - the old Frank that
   was then at that time - and got a bottle of whisky, and took, it with him, and
   'tis unknown how much of it he drank. He walked across to the island, and down
   he went gallantly to the bottom like a stone.</p>
 
   <p>
 Sure enough the Payshtha was there afore
   him, lying like a great big conger eel, seven yards long, and as thick as a
   bull in the' body, with a mane upon his neck like a horse. The Payshtha more
   reared himself up; and, looking at the poor man as if he 'd eat him, says he,
   in good English,</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Arrah, then, Manus,' says he, '
   what brought you here? It would have been better for you to have blown your
   brains out at once with a pistol, and have made a quiet end of yourself, than
   to have come down here for me to deal with you.'</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Oh, plase your honour,' says Manus,
   'I beg my life:' and there he stood shaking like a dog in a wet sack.</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Well, as you have some blood of the
   O'Rourkes in you, I forgive you this once; but, by this and by that, if ever I
   see you, or any one belonging to you, coming about this place again, I'll hang
   a quarter of you on every tree in the wood.'</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Go home,' says the Payshtha - ' go
   home, Manus,' says he; ' and if you can't make better use of your time, get
   drunk; but don't come here, bothering me. Yet, stop ! since you are here, and
   have ventured to come, I'll show you something that you'll remember till you
   go to your grave, and ever after, while you live.'</p>
 
   <p>
 "With that, my dear, he opens an iron
   door in the bed of the river, and never the drop of water ran into it; and
   there Manus sees a long, dry cave, or under-ground cellar like, and the
   Payshtha drags him in, and shuts the door. It wasn't long before the baste
   began to get smaller, and smaller, and smaller; and at last he grew as little
   as a taughn of twelve years old; and there he was, a brownish little man,
   about four feet high."</p>
 
   <p>
 " ' Plase your honour,' says Manus, '
   if I might make so bold, maybe you are one of the good people?'</p>
 
   <p>
 " ' Maybe I am, and maybe I am not;
   but, anyhow, all you have to understand is this, that I'm bound to look after
   the Thiernas [Tighearna - a lord. Vide O'Brien] of Breffni, and take care of
   them through every generation; and that my present business is to watch this
   cave, and what's in it till the old stock <i>is </i>reigning over this country
   once more.'</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Maybe you are a sort of a banshee ?
   '</p>
 
   <p>
 " ' I am not, you fool,' said the
   little man. 'The banshee is a woman. My business is to live in the form you
   first saw me in, guarding this spot. And now hold your tongue, and look about
   you.'</p>
 
   <p>
 Manus rubbed his eyes, and looked right and
   left, before and behind; and there was the vessels of gold and the vessels of
   silver, the dishes, and the plates, and the cups, and the punch-bowls, and the
   tankards: there was the golden mether, too, that every Thierna at his wedding
   used to drink out of to the kerne in real usquebaugh. There was all the money
   that ever was saved in the family since they got a grant of this manor, in the
   days of the Firbolgs, down to the time of their <i>outer </i>ruination. He
   then brought Manus on with him to where there was arms for three hundred men;
   and the sword set with diamonds, and the golden helmet of the O'Rourke; and he
   showed him the staff made out of an elephant's tooth, and set with rubies and
   gold, that the Thierna used to hold while he sat in his great hall, giving
   justice' and the laws of the Brehons to all his clan. The first room in the
   cave, ye see, had ,the money and the plate, the second room had the arms, and
   the third had the books, papers, parchments, title-deeds, wills, and every
   thing else of the sort belonging to the family.</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'And now, Manus,' says the little
   man, 'ye seen the whole o' this, and go your ways; but never come to this
   place any more, or allow any one else. I must keep watch and ward till the
   Sassanach is druv out of Ireland, and the Thiernas o' Breffini in their glory
   again.' The little man then stopped for a while and looked up in Manus's face,
   and says to him in a great passion, 'Arrah ! bad luck to ye, Manus, why don't
   ye go about your business ?'</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'How can I ? - sure you must show me
   the way out,' says Manus, making answer. The little man then pointed forward
   with his finger.</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Can't we go out the way we came ?'
   says Manus.</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'No, you must go out at the other
   end - that's the rule o' this place. Ye came in at Linn-na-Payshtha, and ye
   must go out at Poulmaw-Gullyawn: ye came down like a stone to the bottom of
   one hole, and ye must spring up like a cork to the top of the other.' With
   that the little man gave him one <i>hoise, </i>and all that Manus remembers
   was the roar of the water in his ears; and sure enough he was found the next
   morning, high and dry, fast asleep, with the empty bottle beside him, but far
   enough from the place he thought he landed, for it was just below yonder on
   the island that his wife found him. My father, God be merciful to him ! heard
   Manus swear to every word of the story."</p>
