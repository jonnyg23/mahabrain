 In Tipperary is one of the most
   singularly shaped hills in the world. It has got a peak at the top like a
   conical nightcap thrown carelessly over your head as you awake in the morning.
   On the very point is built a sort of lodge, where in the' summer the lady who
   built it and her friends used to go on parties of pleasure; but that was long
   after the days of the fairies, and it is, I believe, now deserted.</p>
 
   <p>
 But before lodge was built, or acre sown, there was close to
   the head of this bill a large pasturage, where a herdsman spent his days and
   nights among the herd. The spot had been an old fairy ground, and the, good
   people were angry that the scene of their light and airy gambols should be
   trampled by the rude hoofs of bulls- and cows. The lowing of the cattle
   sounded sad in their ears, and the chief of the fairies of the hill determined
   in person to drive away the new comers; and the way she thought of was this.
   When the harvest nights came on, and the moon shone bright and brilliant over
   the hill, and the cattle were lying down hushed and quiet, and the herdsman,
   wrapt in his mantle, was musing with his heart gladdened by the glorious
   company of the stars twinkling above him, she would come and dance before him,
   - now in one shape - now in another, but all ugly
   and frightful to behold. One time she would be a great horse, with the wings
   of an eagle, and a tail like a dragon, hissing loud and spitting fire. Then in
   a moment she would change into a little man lame of a leg, with a bull's head,
   and a lambent flame playing round it. Then into a great ape, with duck's feet
   and a turkey cock's tail. But I should be all day about it were I to tell you
   all the shapes she took. And then she would roar, or neigh, or hiss, or
   bellow, or howl, or hoot, as never yet was roaring, neighing, hissing,
   bellowing, howling, or hooting, heard in this world before or since. The poor
   herdsman would cover his face, and call on all the saints for help, but it was
   no use. With one puff of her breath she would blow away the fold of his great
   Coat, let him hold it never so tightly over his eyes, and not a saint in
   heaven paid him the slightest attention. And to make matters worse, he never
   could stir; no, nor even shut his eyes, but there was obliged to stay, held by
   what power he knew not, gazing at these terrible sights until the hair of his
   head would lift his hat half a foot over his crown, and his teeth would be
   ready to fall out from chattering. But the cattle would scamper about mad, as
   if they were bitten by the fly; and this would last until the sun rose over
   the hill.</p>
 
   <p>
 The poor cattle from want of rest were pining away, and food
   did them no good; besides, they met with accidents without end. Never a night
   passed that some of them did not fall into a pit, and get maimed, or may be,
   killed Some would tumble into a river and be drowned: in a word, there seemed
   never to be an end of the accidents. But what made the matter worse, there
   could not be a herdsman got to tend the cattle by night. One visit from the
   fairy drove the stoutest-hearted almost mad. The owner of the ground did not
   know what to do. He offered double, treble, quadruple wages, but not a man
   could be found for the sake of money to go through the horror of facing the
   fairy. She rejoiced at the successful issue of her project, and continued her
   pranks. The herd gradually thinning, and no man daring to remain on the
   ground, the fairies came back in numbers, and gambolled as merrily as before,
   quaffing dew-drops from acorns, and spreading their feast on the heads of
   capacious mushrooms.</p>
 
   <p>
 What was to be done? the puzzled farmer thought in vain. He
   found that his substance was daily diminishing, his people terrified, and his
   rent day coming round. It is no Wonder that he looked gloomy, and walked
   mournfully down the road. Now in that part of the world dwelt a man of the
   name of Larry Hoolahan, who played on the pipes better than any other player
   within fifteen parishes. A roving dashing blade was Larry, and feared nothing.
   Give him plenty of liquor, and he would defy the devil. He would face a mad
   bull, or fight single-handed against a fair. In one of his gloomy walks the
   farmer met him, and on Larry's asking the cause of his down looks, he told him
   all his misfortunes. " If that is all ails you," said Larry,
   "make your mind easy. Were there as many fairies on Knocksheogowna as'
   there are potato blossoms in Eliogurty, I would face them. It would be a queer
   thing, indeed, if I, who never was afraid of a proper man, should turn my back
   upon a brat of a fairy not the bigness of one's thumb." "
   Larry," said the farmer, " do not talk so bold, for you know not who
   is hearing you; but, if you make your words good, and watch my herds for a
   week on the top of the mountain, your hand shall be free of my dish till the
   sun has burnt itself down to the bigness of a farthing rushlight."</p>
 
   <p>
 The bargain was struck, and Larry went to the hill-top, when
   the' moon began to peep over the brow. He had been regaled at the farmer's
   house, and was bold with the extract of barley-corn. So he took his seat on a
   big stone under a hollow of the bill, with his back to the wind, and pulled
   out his pipes. He had not played long when the voice of the fairies was heard
   upon the blast, like a slow stream of music. Presently they burst out into a
   loud laugh, and Larry could plainly hear one say, "What! another man upon
   the fairies' ring? Go to him, queen, and make him repent his rashness;"
   and they flew away. Larry felt them pass by his face as they flew like a swarm
   of midges; and, looking up hastily, he saw between the moon and him a great
   black cat, standing on the very tip of its claws, with its back up, and mewing
   with the voice of a water-mill. Presently it swelled up towards the sky, and,
   turning round on its left hind leg, whirled till it fell<i> </i>to the ground,
   from which it started up in the shape of a salmon, with a cravat round its
   neck, and a pair of new top boots. " Go on, jewel," said Larry;
   "if you dance, I'll pipe ;" and he struck up. So she turned into
   this, and that, and the other, but still Larry played on, as he well knew how.
   At last she lost patience, as ladies will do when you do not mind their
   scolding, and changed herself into a calf, milk-white as the cream of Cork,
   and with eyes as mild as those of the girl I love. She came up gentle and
   fawning, in hopes to throw him off his guard by quietness, and then to work
   him some wrong. But Larry was not so deceived; for when she came up, he,
   dropping his pipes, leaped upon her back.</p>
 
   <p>
 Now from the top of Knocksheogowna, as you look westward to
   the broad Atlantic, you will see the Shannon, queen of rivers, "
   spreading like a sea, and running on in gentle course to mingle with the ocean
   through the fair city of Limerick. It on this night shone under the moon, and
   looked beautiful from the distant hill. Fifty boats were gliding up and down
   on the sweet current, and the song of the fishermen rose gaily from the shore.
   Larry, as I said before, leaped upon the back of the fairy, and she, rejoiced
   at the opportunity, sprung from the hill-top, and bounded clear, at one jump,
   over the Shannon, flowing as it was just ten miles from the mountain's base.
   It was done in a second, and when 8he alighted on the distant bank, kicking up
   her heels, she flung Larry on the soft turf. No sooner was he thus planted,
   than he looked her straight in the face, and scratching his head, cried out,
   "By my word, well done! that was not a bad leap <i>for a calf!</i>"</p>
 
   <p>
 She looked at him for a moment, and then assumed her own
   shape. "Laurence," said she, "you are a bold fellow; will you
   come back the way you went?" "And that's what I will," said he,
   "if you let me." So changing to a calf again, again Larry got on her
   back, and at another bound they were again upon the top of Knocksheogowna. The
   fairy once more resuming her figure, addressed him: "You have shown so
   much courage, Laurence," said she, "that while 'you keep herds on
   this hill you never shall be molested by me or mine. The day dawns, go down to
   the farmer, and tell him this; and if any thing I can do may be of service to
   you, ask and you shall have it." She vanished accordingly; and kept her
   word in never visiting the hill during Larry's life: but he never troubled her
   with requests. He piped and drank at the farmer's expense, and roosted in his
   chimney corner, occasionally casting an eye to the flock. He died at last,'
   and is buried in a green valley of pleasant Tipperary: but whether the fairies
   returned to the hill of Knocksheogown after<i> </i>his death is more than I
   can say.</p>
