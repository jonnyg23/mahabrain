 <center><h1>The Confessions of Tom Bourke</h1></center>
   <p>
 TOM BOURKE lives in a low long farm-house, resembling in
   outward appearance a large barn, placed at the bottom of the hill, just where
   the new road strikes off from the old one, leading from the town of Kilworth
   to that of Lismore. He is of a class of persons who are a sort of black swans
   in Ireland: he is a wealthy farmer. Tom's father had, in the good old times,
   when a hundred pounds were no inconsiderable treasure, either to lend or
   spend, accommodated his landlord with that sum, at interest; and obtained, as
   a return for the civility, a long lease, about half a dozen times more
   valuable than the loan which procured it. The old man died worth several
   hundred pounds, the greater part of which, with his farm, he bequeathed to his
   son Tom. But, besides all this, Tom received from his father, upon his
   deathbed, another gift, far more valuable than worldly riches, greatly as he
   prized and is still known to prize them.. He was invested with the privilege,
   enjoyed by few of the sons of men, of communicating with those mysterious
   beings called "the good people."</p>
 
   <p>
 Tom Bourke is a little, stout, healthy, active man, about
   fifty-five years of age. His hair is perfectly white, short and bushy behind,
   but rising in front erect and thick above his forehead, like a new
   clothes-brush. His eyes are of that kind which I have often observed with
   persons of a quick but limited intellect - they are small, grey, and lively.
   The large and projecting eyebrows under, or rather within, which they twinkle,
   give them an expression of shrewdness and intelligence, if not of cunning. And
   this is very much the character of the man. If you want to make a bargain with
   Tom Bourke, you must act as if you were a general besieging a town, and make
   your advances a long time before you can hope to obtain possession; if you
   march up boldly, and tell him at once your object, you are for the most part
   sure to have the gates closed in your teeth. Tom does not wish to part with
   what you wish to obtain, or another person has been speaking to him for the
   whole of the last week. Or, it may be, your proposal seems to meet the most
   favourable reception. "Very well, sir;" "That's true,
   Sir;" " I'm very thankful to your honour," and other
   expressions of kindness and confidence, greet you in reply to every sentence;
   and you part from him wondering how he can have obtained the character which
   he universally bears, of being a man whom no one can make any thing of in a
   bargain. But when you next meet him, the flattering illusion is dissolved: you
   find you are a great deal farther from your object than you were when you
   thought you had almost succeeded: his eye and his tongue express a total
   forgetfulness of what the mind within never lost sight of for an instant; and
   you have to begin operations afresh, with the disadvantage of having put your
   adversary completely upon his guard.</p>
 
   <p>
 Yet, although Tom Bourke is, whether from supernatural
   revealings, or (as many will think more probable) from the tell-truth,
   experience, so distrustful of mankind, and so close in his dealings with them,
   he is no misanthrope. No man loves better the pleasures of the genial board.
   The love of money, indeed, which is with him (and who will blame him?) a very
   ruling propensity, and the gratification which it has received from habits of
   industry, sustained throughout a pretty long and successful life, have taught
   him the value of sobriety, during those seasons, at least, when a man's
   business requires him to keep possession of his senses. He has therefore a
   general rule, never to get drunk but on Sundays. But, in order that it should
   be a general one to all intents and purposes, he takes a method which,
   according to better logicians than he is, always proves the rule. He has many
   exceptions: among these, of course, are the evenings of all the fair and
   market. days that happen in his neighbourhood; so also all the days on which
   funerals, marriages, arid christenings. take place among his friends within
   many miles of him. As to this last class of exceptions, it may appear at first
   very singular, that he is much more punctual in his attendance at the funerals
   than at the baptisms or weddings of his friends. This may be construed as an
   instance of disinterested affection for departed worth, very uncommon in this
   selfish world. But I am afraid that the motives which lead Tom Bourke to pay
   more court to the dead than the living are precisely those which lead to the
   opposite conduct in the generality of mankind a hope of future benefit and a
   fear of future evil. For the good people, who are a race as powerful as they
   are capricious, have their favourites among those who inhabit this world;
   often show their affection, by easing the objects of it from the load of this
   burdensome life; and frequently reward or punish the living, according to the
   degree of reverence paid to the obsequies and the memory of the elected dead.</p>
 
   <p>
 It is not easy to prevail on Tom to speak of those good
   people, with whom he is said to hold frequent and intimate communications. To
   the faithful, who believe in their power, and their occasional delegation of
   it to him, he seldom refuses, if properly asked, to exercise his high
   prerogative, when any unfortunate being is <i>struck</i> [the term "fairy
   struck" is applied to paralytic affections, which are supposed to proceed
   from a blow given by the invisible hand of an offended fairy; this belief, of
   course, creates fairy doctors, who by means of charms and mysterious journeys
   profess to cure the afflicted. It is only faiir to add, that the term has also
   a convivial acceptation, the fairies being not un-frequently made to bear the
   blame of the effects arising from too copious a sacrifice to the jolly god. ¦
   The importance attached to the manner and place of burial by the peasantry is
   almost incredible; it is always a matter of consideration and often of dispute
   whether the deceased shall be buried with his or her "own people."]
   in his neighbourhood. Still, he will not be won unsued: he is at first
   difficult of persuasion, and must be overcome by a little gentle violence. On
   these occasions he is unusually solemn and mysterious, and if one word of
   reward be mentioned, he at once abandons the unhappy patient, such a
   proposition being a direct insult to his supernatural superiors. It is true,
   that as the labourer is worthy of his hire, most persons, gifted as he is, do
   not scruple to receive a token of gratitude from the patients or their friends
   <i>after </i>their recovery.</p>
 
   <p>
 To do Tom Bourke justice, he is on these occasions, as I have
   heard from many competent authorities, perfectly disinterested. Not many
   months since, he recovered a young woman (the sister of a tradesman living
   near him), who had been struck speechless after returning from a funeral, and
   had continued so for several days. He steadfastly refused receiving any
   compensation; saying, that even if he had not as much as would buy him his
   supper, he could take nothing in this case, because the girl had offended at
   the funeral one of the <i>good people </i>belonging to his own family, and
   though he would do her a kindness, he could take none from her.</p>
 
   <p>
 About the time this last remarkable affair took place, my
   friend Mr. Martin, who is a neighbour of Tom's, had some business to transact
   with him, which it was exceedingly difficult to bring to a conclusion. At last
   Mr. Martin, having tried all quiet means, had recourse to a legal process,
   which brought Tom to reason, and the matter was arranged to their mutual
   satisfaction, and with perfect good humour between the parties. The
   accommodation took place after dinner at Mr. Martin's house, and he invited
   Tom to walk into the parlour and take a glass of punch, made of some excellent
   <i>potteen, </i>which was on the table : he had long wished to draw out his
   highly 'endowed neighbour on the subject of his supernatural powers, and as
   Mrs. Martin, who was in the room, was rather a favourite of Tom's, this seemed
   a good opportunity.</p>
 
   <p>
 " Well, Tom," said Mr. Martin, " that was a
   curious business of Molly Dwyer's, who recovered her speech so suddenly the
   other day."</p>
 
   <p>
 You may say that, sir," replied Tom Bourke; but I had to
   travel far for it: no matter for that, now. Your
   health, ma'am," said he, turning to Mrs. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Thank you, Tom. But I am told you had some trouble once
   in that way in your own family," said Mrs. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "So I had, ma 'am; trouble enough; but you were only a
   child at that time."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Come, Tom," said the hospitable Mr. Martin,
   interrupting him, " take another tumbler;" and he then added,
   "I wish you would tell us something of the manner in which so many of
   your children died. I am told they dropped off, one after another, by the same
   disorder, and that your eldest son was cured in a most extraordinary way, when
   the physicians had given him over."</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Tis true for you, sir," returned Tom; "your
   father, the doctor (God be good to him, I won't belie him in his grave) told
   me, when my fourth little boy was a week sick, that himself and Doctor Barry
   did all that man could do for him but they could not keep him from going after
   the rest. No more they could, if the people that took away the rest wished to
   take him too. But they left him; and sorry to the heart I am I did not know
   before why they were taking my boys from me; if I did, I would not be left
   trusting to two of 'em now."</p>
 
   <p>
 "And how did you find it out, Tom?" enquired Mr.
   Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Why, then, I'll tell you, sir," said Bourke.</p>
 
   <p>
 "When your father said what I told you, I did not know
   very well what to do. I walked down the little <i>bohereen </i>you know, sir,
   that goes to the river side near Dick Heafy's ground; for 't was a lonesome
   place, and I wanted to think of myself. I was heavy, sir, and my heart got
   weak in me, when I thought I was to lose my little boy; and I did not know
   well how to face his mother with the news, for she doted down upon him.
   Beside, she never got the better of all she cried at his brother's berrin
   (burying) the week before. As I was going down the bohereen, I met an old
   bocough [A peculiar class of beggars resembling the Gaberlunzie man of
   Scotland] , that used to come about the place once or twice a year, and used
   always sleep in our barn while he staid in the neighbourhood. So he asked me
   how I was. 'Bad enough, Shamous (James,)' says I. 'I'm sorry for your
   trouble,' says he; 'but you're a foolish man, Mr. Bourke. Your son would be
   well enough if you would only do what you ought with him.' 'What more can I do
   with him, Shamous?' says I: 'the doctors give him over.' 'The doctors know no
   more what ails him than they do what ails a cow when she stops her milk,' says
   Shamous: 'but go to such a one,' says he, telling me his name, 'and try what
   he'll say to you.' "</p>
 
   <p>
 "And who was that, Tom?" asked Mr. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "I could not tell you that, sir," said Bourke, with
   a mysterious look: "howsoever, you often saw him, and he does not live
   far from this. But I had a trial of him before; and if I went to him at first,
   may be I'd have now some of the them that's gone, and so Shamous often told
   me. Well, sir, I went to this man, and he came with me to the house. By
   course, I did every thing as he bid me. According to his order, I took the
   little boy out of the dwelling-house immediately, sick as he was, and made a
   bed for him and myself in the cow-house. Well; sir, I lay down by his side, in
   the bed, between two of the cows, and he fell asleep. He got into a
   perspiration, saving your presence, as if he was drawn through the river, and
   breathed hard, with a great <i>impression </i>(oppression) on his chest, and
   was very bad - very bad entirely through the night. I thought about twelve
   o'clock he was going at last, and I was just getting up to go call the man I
   told you of; but there was no occasion. My friends were getting the better of
   them that wanted to take him away from me. There was nobody in the cow-house
   but the child and myself. There was only one halfpenny candle lighting, and
   that was stuck in the wall at the far end of the house. I had just enough of
   light where we were laying to see a person walking or standing near us: and
   there was no more noise than if it was a churchyard, except the cows chewing
   the fodder in the stalls. Just as I was thinking of getting up, as I told you
   - I won't belie my father, sir - he was a good
   father to me - I saw him standing at the bed-side, holding out his right hand
   to me, and leaning his other hand on the stick he used to carry when he was
   alive, and looking pleasant and smiling at me, all as if he was telling me not
   to be afeard, for I would not lose the child. ' Is that you, father ?' says I.
   He said nothing. 'If that's you,' says I again, 'for the love of them that's
   gone, let me catch your hand.' And so he did, sir; and his hand was as soft as
   a child's. He stayed about as long as you'd be going from this to the gate
   below at the end of the avenue, and then went away. In less than a week the
   child was as well as if nothing ever ailed him; and there isn't to-night a
   healthier boy of nineteen, from this blessed house to the town of Ballyporeen,
   across the Kilworth mountains."</p>
 
   <p>
 But I think, Tom," said Mr. Martin, "it appears as
   if you are more indebted to your father than to the man recommended to you by
   Shamous; or do you suppose it was he who made favour with your enemies among
   the good people, and that then your father -"</p>
 
   <p>
 "I beg your pardon, sir," said Bourke, interrupting
   him; "but don't call them my enemies. 'T would not be wishing to me for a
   good deal to sit by when they are called so. No offence to you, sir. - Here's
   wishing you a good health and long life."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I assure you," returned Mr. Martin, " I meant
   no offence, Tom; but was it not as I say?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "I can't tell you that sir," said Bourke; "I'm
   bound down, sir. Howsoever, you may be sure the man I spoke of; and my father,
   and those they know, settled it between them."</p>
 
   <p>
 There was a pause, of which Mrs. Martin took advantage to
   enquire of Tom, whether something remarkable had not happened about a goat and
   a pair of pigeons, at the time of his son's illness - circumstances often
   mysteriously hinted at by Tom.</p>
 
   <p>
 "See that now," said he, turning to Mr. Martin,
   "how well she remembers it! True for you, ma'am. The goat I gave the
   mistress, your mother, when the doctors ordered her goats' whey."</p>
 
   <p>
 Mrs. Martin nodded assent, and Tom Bourke continued -"
   Why, then, I'll tell you how that was. The goat was as well as e'er a goat
   ever was, for a month after she was sent to Killaan to your father's. The
   morning after the night I just told you of; before the child woke, his mother
   was standing at the gap, leading out of the barn-yard into the road, and she
   saw two pigeons flying from the town of Kilworth, off the church, down towards
   her. Well, they never stopped, you see, till they came to the house on the
   hill at the other side of the river, facing our farm. They pitched upon the
   chimney of that house, and after looking about them for a minute or two, they
   flew straight across the river, and stopped on the ridge of the cow,-house
   where the child and I were lying. Do you think they came there for nothing,
   sir?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Certainly not, Tom," returned Mr. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Well, the woman came in to me, frightened,and told me.
   She began to cry. - 'Whisht, you fool !' says I: ' 'tis all for the. better.'
   'Twas true for me. What do you think, ma'am; the goat that I gave your mother,
   that was seen feeding at sunrise that morning by Jack Cronin, as merry as a
   bee, dropped down dead, without any body knowing why, before Jack's face ; and
   at that very moment he saw two pigeons fly from the top of the house out of
   the town, towards the Lismore road. 'T was at the same time my woman saw them,
   as I just told you.</p>
 
   <p>
 'T was very strange, indeed, Tom," said Mr. Martin;
   "I wish you could give us some explanation of it."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I wish I could, sir," was Tom Bourke's answer;
   "but I'm bound down. I can't tell but what I'm allowed to tell, any more
   than a sentry is let walk more than his rounds."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I think you said something of having had some former
   knowledge of the man that assisted in the cure of your son," said Mr.
   Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 So I had, sir," returned Bourke. " I had a trial of
   that man. But that's neither here nor there. I can't tell you any thing about
   that, sir. But would you like to know how he got his skill?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Oh! very much, indeed," said Mr. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "But you can tell us his Christian name, that we may know
   him the better through the story," added Mrs. Martin. Tom Bourke paused
   for a minute to consider this proposition.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Well, I believe I may tell you that, any how; his name
   is Patrick. He was always a smart, active, 'cute boy, and would be a great
   clerk if he stuck to it. The first time I knew him, sir, was at my mother's
   wake. I was in great trouble, for I did not know where to bury her. Her people
   arid my father's people - I mean their friends, sir, among the <i>good people,
   </i>had the greatest battle that was known for many a year, at Dunmanwaycross,
   to see to whose churchyard she'd be taken. They fought for three nights, one
   after another, without being able to settle it. The neighbours wondered how
   long I was before I buried my mother; but I had my reasons, though I could not
   tell them at that time. Well, sir, to make my story short, Patrick came on the
   fourth morning and told me he settled the business, and that day we buried her
   in Kilcrumper churchyard, with my father's people."</p>
 
   <p>
 "He was a valuable friend, Tom," said Mrs. Martin,
   with difficulty suppressing a smile. "But you were about to tell how he
   became so skillful."</p>
 
   <p>
 "So I will, and welcome," replied Bourke. "Your
   health, ma'am. I am drinking too much of this punch, sir; but to tell the
   truth, I never tasted the like of it: it goes down one's throat like sweet
   oil. But what was [ going to say? -Yes - well - Patrick, many a long. year
   ago, was coming home from a <i>berrin </i>late in the evening, and walking by
   the side of the river, opposite the big inch [Inch - low meadow ground near a
   river], near Ballyhefaan ford [A ford of the river Funcheon (the Fanchin of
   Spenser), on the road leading from Fermoy to Araglin]. He had taken a drop, to
   be sure; but he was only a little merry, as you may say, and knew very well
   what he was doing. The moon was shining, for it was in the month of August,
   and the river was as smooth and as bright as a looking-glass. He heard nothing
   for a long time but the fall of the water at the mill wier about a mile down
   the river, and now and then the crying of the lambs on the other side of the
   river. All at once, there was a noise of a great number of people, laughing as
   if they'd break their hearts, and of a piper playing among them. It came from
   the inch at the other side of the ford, and he saw, through the mist that hung
   over the river, a whole crowd of people dancing on the inch. Patrick was as
   fond of a dance as he was of a glass, and that's saying enough for him; so he
   whipped [<i>ie. </i>"the time of the crack of a whip," he took off
   his shoes and stockings] off his shoes and stockings, and away with him across
   the ford. After putting on his shoes and stockings at the other side of the
   river, he walked over to the crowd, and mixed with them for some time without
   being minded. He thought, sir, that he'd show them better dancing than any of
   themselves, for he was proud of his feet, sir, and good right he had, for
   there was not a boy in the same parish could foot a double or treble with him.
   But pwah I - his dancing was no more to theirs than mine would be to the
   mistress there. They did not seem as if they had a bone in their bodies, and
   they kept it up as if nothing could tire them. Patrick was 'shamed within
   himself, for he thought he had not his fellow in all the country round; and
   was going away, when a little old man, that was looking at the company for
   some time bitterly, as if he did not like what was going on, came up to him.
   'Patrick,' says he.</p>
 
   <p>
 Patrick started, for he did not think any body there knew him.
   ' Patrick,' says he, you're discouraged, and. no wonder for you. But you have
   a friend near you. I 'm your friend, and your father's friend, and I think
   worse (more) of your little finger than I do of all that are here, though they
   think no one is as good as themselves. Go into the ring and call for a lilt.
   Don't be afeard. I tell you the best of them did not do as well as you shall,
   if you will do as I bid you.' Patrick felt something within him as if he ought
   not to gainsay the old man. He went into the ring, and called the piper to
   play up the best double he had. And, sure enough, all that the others were
   able for was nothing to him! He bounded like an eel, now here and now there,
   as light as a feather, although the people could hear the music answered by
   his steps, that beat time to every turn of it, like the left foot of the
   piper. He first danced a hornpipe on the ground. Then they got a table, and he
   danced a treble on it that drew down shouts from the whole company. At last he
   called for a trencher; and when they saw him, all as if he was spinning on it
   like a top, they did not know what to make of him. Some praised him for the
   best dancer that ever entered a ring; others hated him because he was better
   than themselves; although they had good right to think themselves better than
   him or any other man that never went the long journey."</p>
 
   <p>
 "And what was the cause of his great success?"
   enquired Mr. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "He could not help it, sir," replied Tom Bourke.
   "They that could make him do more than that made him do it. Howsomever,
   when he had done, they wanted him to dance again, but he was tired, and they
   could not persuade him. At last he got angry, and swore a big oath, saving
   your presence, that he would not dance a step more; and the word was hardly
   out of his mouth, when he found himself all alone, with nothing but a white
   cow grazing by his side."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Did he ever discover why he was gifted with these
   extraordinary powers in the dance, Tom'?" said Mr. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "I'll tell you that too, sir," answered Bourke,
   "when I come to it. When he went home, sir, be was taken with a
   shivering, and went to bed; and the next day they found he got the fever, or
   something like it, for he raved like as if he was mad. But they couldn't make
   out what it was he was saying, though he talked constant. The doctors gave him
   over. But it 's little they know what ailed him. When he was<i>, </i>as you
   may say, about ten days sick, and every body thought he was going, one of the
   neighbours came in to him with a man, a friend of his, from Ballinlacken, that
   was keeping with him some time before. I can't tell you his name either, only
   it was Darby. The minute Darby saw Patrick, he took a little bottle, with the
   juice of herbs in it, out of his pocket, and gave Patrick a drink of it. He
   did the same every day for three weeks, and then Patrick was able to walk
   about, as stout and as hearty as ever he was in his life. But be was a long
   time before he came to himself; and he used to walk the whole day sometimes by
   the ditch side, talking to himself, like as if there was some one along with
   him. And so there was, surely, or he wouldn't be the man he is to-day.</p>
 
   <p>
 "I suppose it was from some such companion lie learned
   his skill," said Mr. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "You have it all now, sir," replied Bourke.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Darby told him his friends were satisfied with what he
   did the night of the dance; and though they couldn't hinder the fever, they'd
   bring him over it, and teach him more than many knew beside him. And so they
   did. For you see all the people he met on the inch that night were friends of
   a different faction; only the old man that spoke to him; he was a friend of
   Patrick's family, and it went again' his heart, you see, that the others were
   so light and active, and he was bitter in himself to hear 'em boasting how
   they'd dance with any set in the whole country round. So he gave Patrick the
   gift that night, and afterwards gave him the skill that makes him the wonder
   of all that know him. And to be sure it was only learning he was that time
   when he was wandering in his mind after the fever."</p>
 
   <p>
 "I have heard many strange stories about that inch near
   Ballyhefaan ford," said Mr. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 " 'Tis a great place for the good people, isn't it,
   Tom?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "You may say that, sir," returned Bourke. "I
   could tell you a great deal about it. Many a time I
   sat for as good as two hours by moon-light, at th' other side of the river,
   looking at 'em playing goal as if they'd break their hearts over it; with
   their coats and waistcoats off, and white handkerchiefs on the heads of one
   party, and red ones on th' other, just as you'd see on a Sunday in Mr.
   Simming's big field. I saw 'em one night play till the moon set, without one
   party being able to take the ball from th' other. I'm sure they were going to
   fight, only 'twas near morning. I'm told your grandfather, ma'am, used to see
   'em there, too," said Bourke, turning to Mrs. Martin.</p>
 
   <p>
 "So I have been told, Torn," replied Mrs. Martin.
   "But don't they say that the church yard of Kilcrumper [about two hundred
   yards off the Dublin mail-coach road, nearly mid-way between Kilworth and
   Fermoy] is just as favourite a place with the good people, as Ballyhefaan
   inch."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Why, then may be, you never heard, ma'am, what happened
   to Davy Roche in that same churchyard," said Bourke; and turning to Mr.
   Martin, added, " 't was a long time before he went into your service,
   sir. He was walking home, of an evening, from the fair of Kilcummer, a little
   merry, to be sure, after the day, and he came up with a berrin. So he walked
   along with it, and thought it very queer, that he did not know a mother's soul
   in the crowd, but one man, and he was sure that man was dead many years afore.
   Howsomever, he went on with the berrin, till they came to Kilcrumper
   churchyard; and faith he went in and staid with the rest, to see the corpse
   buried. As soon as the grave was covered, what should they do but gather about
   a piper that <i>come</i> along with 'em and fall to dancing as if it was a
   wedding. Davy longed to be among 'em (for he hadn' t a bad foot of his own,
   that time, whatever he may now); but he was loath to begin, because they all
   seemed strange to him, only the man I told you that he thought was dead. Well,
   at last this man saw what Davy wanted, and came up to him. 'Davy,' says he,
   'take out a partner, and show what you can do, but take care and don't offer
   to kiss her.' 'That I won't,' says Davy, ' although her lips were made of
   honey.' And with that he made his bow to the <i>purtiest </i>girl in the ring,
   and he and she began to dance. 'T was a jig they danced, and they did it to
   th' admiration, do you see, of all that were there. 'T was all very well till
   the jig was over ; but just as they had done, Davy, for he had a drop in, and
   was warm with the dancing, forgot himself, and kissed his partner, according
   to custom. The smack was no sooner off of his lips, you see, than he was left
   alone in the churchyard, without a creature near him, and all he could see was
   the the tombstones. Davy said they seemed as if they were dancing too, but I
   suppose that was only the wonder that happened him, and he being a little in
   drink. Howsomever, he found it was a great many hours later than he thought
   it; 'twas near morning when he came home ; but they couldn't get a word out of
   him till the next day, when he 'woke out of a dead sleep about twelve
   o'clock."</p>

 When Tom had finished the account of Davy Roche and the
   berrin, it became quite evident that spirits of some sort were working too
   strong within him to admit of his telling many more tales of the good people.
   Tom seemed conscious of this.- He muttered for a few minutes broken sentences
   concerning churchyards, river-sides, leprechans, and <i>dina magh, </i>which
   were quite un-intelligible, perhaps to himself, certainly to Mr. Martin and
   his lady. At length he made a slight motion of the head upwards, as if he
   would say, " I can talk no more;" stretched his arm on the table,
   upon which he placed the empty tumbler slowly, and with the most knowing and
   cautious air; and rising from his chair, walked, or rather rolled, to the
   parlour-door. Here he turned round to face his host and hostess; but after
   various ineffectual attempts to bid them good night, the words, as they rose,
   being always choked by a violent hiccup, while the door, which he held by the
   handle, swung to and fro, carrying his unyielding body along with it, he was
   obliged to depart in silence. The cow-boy, sent by Tom's wife, who knew well
   what sort of allurement, detained him, when he remained out after a certain
   hour, was in attendance to conduct his master home. I have no doubt that he
   returned without meeting any material injury, as I know that within the last
   month, he was, to use his own words, "As stout and hearty a man as any of
   his age in the county Cork."</p>
