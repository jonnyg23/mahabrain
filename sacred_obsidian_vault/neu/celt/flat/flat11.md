 <center><h1>Fairies Or No Fairies</h1></center>
   <p>
 JOHN MULLIGAN was as fine an old fellow as ever threw a Carlow
   spur into the sides of a horse. He was, besides, as jolly a boon companion
   over a jug of punch as you would meet from Carnsore Point to Bloody Farland.
   And a good horse he used to ride; and a stiffer jug of punch than his was not
   in nineteen baronies. May be he stuck more to it than he ought to have
   done-but that is nothing whatever to the story I am going to tell.</p>
 
   <p>
 John believed devoutly in fairies; and an angry man was he if
   you doubted them. He had more fairy<i> </i>stories than would make, if
   properly printed in a rivulet of print running down a meadow of margin, two
   thick quartos for Mr. Murray, of Albemarle street; all of which he used to
   tell on all occasions that he could find listeners. Many believed his stories
   - many more did not believe them - but nobody, in process of time, used to
   contradict the old gentleman, for it was a pity to vex him. But he had a
   couple of young neighbours who were just come down from their first vacation
   in Trinity College to spend the summer months with an uncle of theirs, Mr.
   Whaley, an old Cromwellian, who lived at Ballybegmullinahone, and they were
   too full of logic to let the old man have his own way undisputed.</p>
 
   <p>
 Every story he told they laughed at, and said that it was
   impossible - that it was merely old woman's gabble, and other such things.
   When he would insist that all his stories were derived from the most credible
   sources - nay, that some of them had been told him by his own grandmother, a
   very respectable old lady, but slightly affected in her faculties, as things
   that came under her own knowledge - they cut the matter short by declaring
   that she was in her dotage, and at the best of times had a strong propensity
   to pulling a long bow.</p>
 
   <p>
 "But," said they, "Jack Mulligan, did you ever
   see a fairy yourself?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Never," was the reply. - Never, as I am a man of
   honour and credit."</p>
 
   <p>
 "Well, then," they answered, " until you do, do
   not be bothering us with any more tales of my grandmother."</p>
 
   <p>
 Jack was particularly nettled at this, and took up the:
   cudgels for his grandmother; but the younkers were too sharp for him, and
   finally he got into a passion, as people generally do who have the worst of an
   argument. This evening - it was at their uncle's, an old crony of his with
   whom he had dined - he bad taken a large portion of his usual beverage, and
   was quite riotous. He at last got up in a passion, ordered his horse, and, in
   spite of his host's entreaties, galloped off, although he had intended to have
   slept there, declaring that he would not have any thing more to do with a pair
   of jackanapes puppies, who, because they had learned how to read
   good-for-nothing hooks in cramp writing, and were taught by a parcel of wiggy,
   red-snouted, prating prigs, ("not," added he, "however, that I
   say a man may not be a good man and have a red nose,") they imagined they
   knew more than a man who had held buckle and tongue together facing the wind
   of the world for five dozen years.</p>
 
   <p>
 He rode off in a fret, and galloped as hard as his horse
   Shaunbuie could powder away over the limestone. " Damn it!"
   hiccupped he, " Lord pardon me for swearing! the brats had me in one
   thing - I never did see a fairy; and I would give up five as good acres as
   ever grew apple-potatoes to get a glimpse of one - and, by the powers! what is
   that?"</p>
 
   <p>
 He looked, and saw a gallant spectacle. His road lay by a
   noble demesne, gracefully sprinkled with trees, not thickly planted as in a
   dark forest, but disposed, now in clumps of five or six, now standing singly,
   towering over the plain of verdure around them, as a beautiful promontory
   arising out of the sea. He had come right opposite the glory of the wood. It
   was an oak, which in the oldest title-deeds of the county, and they were at
   least five hundred years old, was called the old oak of Ballinghassig. Age had
   hollowed its centre, but its massy boughs still waved with their dark serrated
   foliage. The moon was shining on it bright. If I were a poet, like Mr.
   Wordsworth, I should tell you how the beautiful light was broken into a
   thousand different fragments - and how it. filled the entire tree with a
   glorious flood, bathing every particular leaf, and showing forth every
   particular bough; but, as I am not a poet, I shall go on with my story. By
   this light Jack saw a, brilliant company of lovely little forms dancing under
   the oak with an unsteady and rolling motion. The company was large. Some
   spread out far beyond the furthest boundary of the shadow of the oak's
   branches - some were seen glancing through the flashes of light shining
   through its leaves - some were barely visible, nestling under the trunk - some
   no doubt were entirely concealed from his eyes. Never did man see any thing
   more beautiful. They were not three inches in height, but they were white as
   the driven snow, and beyond number numberless. Jack threw the bridle over his
   horse's neck, and drew up to the low wall which bounded the demesne, and
   leaning over it, surveyed, with infinite delight, their diversified gambols.
   By looking long at them, he soon saw objects which had not struck him at
   first; in particular that in the middle was a chief of superior stature, round
   whom the group appeared to move. He gazed so long that he was quite overcome
   with joy, and could not help shouting out, " Bravo! little fellow,"
   said he, well kicked and strong." But the instant he uttered the words
   the night was darkened, and the fairies vanished with the speed of lightning.</p>
 
   <p>
 " I wish," said Jack, "I had held my tongue;
   but no matter now. I shall just turn bridle about and go back to
   Ballybegmullinahone Castle, and beat the young Master Whaleys, fine reasoners
   as they think themselves, out of the field clean."</p>
 
   <p>
 No sooner said than done; and Jack was back again as if upon
   the wings of the wind. He rapped fiercely at the door, and called aloud for
   the two collegians.</p>
 
   <p>
 " Hallo!" said he, "young Flatcaps, come down
   now, if you dare. Come down, if you dare, and I shall give you <i>oc-oc-</i>ocular
   demonstration of the truth of what I was saying."</p>
 
   <p>
 Old Whaley put his head out of the window, and said,
   "Jack Mulligan, what brings you back so soon?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "The fairies," shouted Jack; "the
   fairies!"</p>
 
   <p>
 I am afraid<i>," </i>muttered the Lord of
   Ballybegmullinahone, " the last glass you took was too little watered:
   but, no matter - come in and cool yourself over a tumbler of punch."</p>
 
   <p>
 He came in and sat down again at table. In great spirits he
   told his story ; - how he had seen thousands and tens of thousands of fairies
   dancing about the old oak of Balllinghassig; he described their beautiful
   dresses of shining silver; their flat-crowned hats, glittering in the
   moonbeams; the princely stature and demeanour of the central figure. He added,
   that he heard them singing, and playing the most enchanting music; but this
   was merely imagination. The young men laughed, but Jack held his ground.
   "Suppose, said one of the lads, " we join company with you on the
   road, and ride along to the place, where you saw that fine company of
   fairies?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Done!" cried Jack; "but I will not promise
   that you will find them there, for I saw them scudding up in the sky like a
   flight of bees, and heard their wings whizzing through the air." This,
   you know, was a bounce, for Jack had heard no such thing.</p>
 
   <p>
 Off rode the three, and came to the demesne of Oakwood. They
   arrived at the wall flanking the field where stood the great oak; and the
   moon, by this time, having again emerged from the clouds, shone bright as when
   Jack had passed. "Look there," he cried, exultingly; for the same
   spectacle again caught his eyes, and he pointed to it with his horsewhip;
   " look, and deny if you can. "</p>
 
   <p>
 "Why," said one of the lads, pausing, " true it
   is that we do see a company of white creatures; but were they fairies ten
   time~ over, I shall go among them;" and he dismounted to climb over the
   wall.</p>
 
   <p>
 "Ah, Tom Tom;" cried Jack, " stop, man, stop!
   what are you doing? The fairies - the good people, I mean - hate to be meddled
   with. You will be pinched or bIinded; or your horse will cast its shoe; or -
   look! a wilful man will have his way. Oh! oh! he is almost at the oak - God
   help him! for he is past the help of man."</p>
 
   <p>
 By this time Tom was under the tree and burst out laughing.
   "Jack," said he, "keep your prayers to yourself. Your fairies
   are not bad at all. I believe they will make tolerably good catsup."</p>
 
   <p>
 Catsup," said Jack, who when he found that the two lads
   (for the second had followed his brother) were both laughing in the middle of
   the fairies, had dismounted and advanced slowly -What do you mean by
   catsup?"</p>
 
   <p>
 "Nothing," replied Tom, " but that they are
   mushrooms (as indeed they were); and your Oberon is merely this overgrown
   puff-ball."</p>
 
   <p>
 Poor Mulligan gave a long whistle of amazement, staggered back
   to his horse without saying a word, and rode home in a hard gallop, never
   looking behind him. Many a long day was it before he ventured to face the
   laughers at Ballybegmullinahone; and to the day of his death the people of the
   parish, aye, and five parishes round, called him nothing but Musharoon Jack,
   such being their pronunciation of mushroom.</p>
 
   <p>
 I should be sorry if all my fairy stories ended with so little
   dignity; but -</p>
 
     <p>
 <i>"These our actors,<br>
 
     As I foretold you, were all spirits, and<br>
 
     Are melted into air - into thin air."</i></p>
