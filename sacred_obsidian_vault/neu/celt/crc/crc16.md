 <p>'Let an offer go to him,' said Ailill, 'that Findabair will be given to him on condition that he keeps away from the hosts.'</p>  
 <p>Mane Athramail goes to him. He goes first to Loeg.</p>  
 <p>'Whose man are you?' said he.</p>  
 <p>Loeg does not speak to him. Mane spoke to him thrice in this way.</p>  
 <p>'Cuchulainn's man,' said he, 'and do not disturb me, lest I strike your head off.'</p>  
 <p>'This man is fierce,' said Mane, turning from him. He goes then to speak to Cuchulainn. Now Cuchulainn had taken off his tunic, and the snow was round</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_63"><font size="1" color="green">p. 63</font></a></p>  
 <p>him up to his waist as he sat, and the snow melted round him a cubit for the greatness of the heat of the hero.</p>  
 <p>Mane said to him in the same way thrice, 'whose man was he?'</p>  
 <p>'Conchobar's man, and do not disturb me. If you disturb me any longer, I will strike your head from you as the head is taken from a blackbird.'</p>  
 <p>'It is not easy,' said Mane, 'to speak to these two.'</p>  
 <p>Mane goes from them then and tells his tale to Ailill and Medb.</p>  
 <p>'Let Lugaid go to him,' said Ailill, 'and offer to him the maiden.'</p>  
 <p>Lugaid goes then and tells Cuchulainn that.</p>  
 <p>'O friend Lugaid,' said Cuchulainn, 'this is a snare.'</p>  
 <p>'It is the king's word that has said it,' said Lugaid; 'there will be no snare therefrom.'</p>  
 <p>'Let it be done so,' said Cuchulainn.</p>  
 <p>Lugaid went from him therewith, and tells Ailill and Medb that answer.</p>  
 <p>'Let the fool go in my form,' said Ailill, 'and a king's crown on his head, and let him stand at a distance from Cuchulainn lest he recognise him, and let the maiden go with him, and let him betroth her to him, and let them depart quickly in this way; and it is likely that you will play a trick on him thus, so that he will not hinder you, till he comes with the Ulstermen to the battle.'</p>  
 <p>Then the fool goes to him, and the maiden also; and it was from a distance he spoke to Cuchulainn. Cuchulainn goes to meet them. It happened that he recognised by the man's speech that he was a fool. He threw a sling stone that was in his hand at him,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_64"><font size="1" color="green">p. 64</font></a></p>  
 <p>so that it sprang into his head and brought his brains out. Then he comes to the maiden, cuts her two tresses off, and thrusts a stone through her mantle and through her tunic, and thrusts a stone pillar through the middle of the fool. There are their two pillars there: the pillar of Findabair, and the fool's pillar.</p>  
 <p>Cuchulainn left them thus. A party was sent from Ailill and Medb to seek out their folk, for they thought they were long; they were seen in this position. All this was heard throughout the camp. There was no truce for them with Cuchulainn afterwards.</p>
