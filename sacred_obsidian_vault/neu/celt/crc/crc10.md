 <p>Cuchulainn killed no one from the Saile ind Orthi (?) in the Conaille territory, until they reached Cualnge. Cuchulainn was then in Cuince; he threatened then that when he saw Medb he would throw a stone at her head. This was not easy to him, for it is thus that Medb went and half the host about her, with their shelter of shields over her head.</p>  
 <p>Then a waiting-woman of Medb's, Lochu by name, went to get water, and a great troop of women with her. Cuchulainn thought it was Medb. He threw two stones from Cuince, so that he slew her in her plain (?). Hence is Ath Rede Locha in Cualnge.</p>  
 <p>From Findabair Cuailnge the hosts divided, and they set the country on fire. They collect all there were of women, and boys, and maidens, and cattle, in Cualnge together, so that they were all in Findabair.</p>  
 <p>'You have not gone well,' said Medb; 'I do not see the Bull with you.'</p>  
 <p>'He is not in the province at all,' said every one.</p>  
 <p>Lothar the cowherd is summoned to Medb.</p>  
 <p>'Where is the Bull?' said she. 'Have you an idea?'</p>  
 <p>'I have great fear to tell it,' said the herd. 'The night,' said he, 'when the Ulstermen went into their weakness, he went with three twenties of heifers</p>  
 <p><a name="page_42"><font size="1" color="green">p. 42</font></a></p>  
 <p>with him, so that he is at the Black Corrie of Glenn Gatt.'</p>  
 <p>'Go,' said Medb, 'and carry a withe <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">1</font></a> between each two of you.'</p>  
 <p>They do this: hence this glen is called Glenn Gatt. Then they bring the Bull to Findabair. The place where he saw the herd, Lothar, he attacked him, so that he brought his entrails out on his horns; and he attacked the camp with his three fifties of heifers, so that fifty warriors were killed. And that is the death of Lothar on the Foray.</p>  
 <p>Then the Bull went from them out of the camp, and they knew not where he had gone from them; and they were ashamed. Medb asked the herd if he had an idea where the Bull was.</p>  
 <p>'I think he would be in the secret places of Sliab Culind.'</p>  
 <p>Then they returned thus after ravaging Cualnge, and did not find the Bull there. The river Cronn rose against them to the tops of the trees; and they spent the night by it. And Medb told part of her following to go across.</p>  
 <p>A wonderful warrior went next day, Ualu his name. He took a great stone on his back to go across the water; the stream drove him backwards with the stone on his back. His grave and his stone are on the road at the stream: Lia Ualand is its name.</p>  
 <p>They went round the river Cronn to the source, and they would have gone between the source and the mountain, only that they could not get leave from Medb; she preferred to go across the mountain, that their track might remain there for ever, for an insult</p>

 <p>to the Ulstermen. They waited there three days and three nights, till they dug the earth in front of them, the Bernas Bo Cuailnge.</p>  
 <p>It is there that Cuchulainn killed Crond and Cœmdele and ———. <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">1</font></a> A hundred warriors died ——— <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">1</font></a> with Roan and Roae, the two historians of the Foray. A hundred and forty-four, kings died by him at the same stream. They came then over the Bernas Bo Cuailnge with the cattle and stock of Cualnge, and spent the night in Glenn Dail Imda in Cualnge. Botha is the name of this place, because they made huts over them there. They come next day to Colptha. They try to cross it through heedlessness. It rose against them then, and it carries a hundred charioteers of them to the sea; this is the name of the land in which they were drowned, Cluain Carptech.</p>  
 <p>They go round Colptha then to its source, to Belat Alioin, and spent the night at Liasa Liac; that is the name of this place, because they made sheds over their calves there between Cualnge and Conaille. They came over Glenn Gatlaig, and Glass Gatlaig rose against them. Sechaire was its name before; Glass Gatlaig thenceforth, because it was in withes they brought their calves; and they slept at Druim Fene in Conaille. (Those then are the wanderings from Cualnge to Machaire according to this version.)</p>
