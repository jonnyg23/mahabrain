   <p>
 The Curse of Macha</p>
 
 
 <p>
 THE centre of interest in Irish legend now
 shifts from Tara to Ulster, and a multitude of heroic tales gather round the
 Ulster king Conor mac Nessa, round Cuchulain, [pronounced
 "Koohoo´lin."] his great vassal, and the Red Branch Order of
 chivalry, which had its seat in Emain Macha.</p>
 
 <p>
 The legend of the foundation of Emain Macha
 has already been told [page 150]. But Macha, who was no mere woman, but a
 supernatural being, appears again in connexion with the history of Ulster in a
 very curious tale which was supposed to account for the strange debility or
 helplessness that at critical moments sometimes fell, it was believed, upon the
 warriors of the province.</p>
 
 <p>
 The legend tells that a wealthy Ulster farmer
 named Crundchu, son of Agnoman, dwelling in a solitary place among the hills,
 found one day in his dūn a young woman of great beauty and in splendid
 array, whom he had never seen before. Crundchu, we are told, was a widower, his
 wife having died after bearing him four sons. The strange woman, without a word,
 set herself to do the houshold tasks, prepared dinner, milked the cow, and took
 on herself all the duties of the mistress of the household. At night she lay
 down at Crundchu's side, and thereafter dwelt with him as his wife; and they
 loved each other dearly. Her name was Macha.</p>
 
 <p>
 One day Crundchu prepared himself to go to a
 great fair or assembly of the Ultonians, where there would be feasting and
 horse-racing, tournaments and music, and merrymaking of all kinds. Macha begged
 her husband</p>
 
 <p>
 [178]</p>
 
 <p>
 not to go. He persisted. " Then,"
 she said, " at least do not speak of me in the assembly, for I may dwell
 with you only so long as I am not spoken of."</p>
 
 <p>
 It has been observed that we have here the
 earliest appearance in postclassical European literature of the well-known
 motive of the fairy bride who can stay with her mortal lover only so long as
 certain conditions are observed, such as that he shall not spy upon her,
 ill-treat her, or ask of her origin.</p>
 
 <p>
 Crundchu promised to obey the injunction, and
 went to the festival. Here the two horses of the king carried off prize after
 prize in the racing, and the people cried "There is not in Ireland a
 swifter than the King's pair of horses."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I have a wife at home," said
 Crundchu, in a moment of forgetfulness, "who can run quicker than these
 horses."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Seize that man," said the angry
 king, "and hold him till his wife be brought to the contest."</p>
 
 <p>
 So messengers went for Macha, and she was
 brought before the assembly; and she was with child. The king bade her prepare
 for the race. She pleaded her condition. "I am close upon my hour,"
 she said. "Then hew her man in pieces," said the king to his guards.
 Macha turned to the bystanders. "Help me," she cried, " for a
 mother hath borne each of you ! Give me but a short delay till I am
 delivered." But the king and all the crowd in their savage lust for sport
 would hear of no delay. "Then bring up the horses," said Macha,
 "and because you have no pity a heavier infamy shall fall upon you."
 So she raced against the horses, and outran them, but as she came to the goal
 she gave a great cry, and her travail seized her, and she gave birth to twin
 children. As she uttered that cry, however, all the spectators felt</p>
 
 <p>
 [179]</p>
 
 <p>
 themselves seized with pangs like her own and
 had no more strength than a woman in her travail. And Macha prophesied
 "From this hour the shame you have wrought on me will fall upon each man of
 Ulster. In the hours of your greatest need ye shall be weak and helpless as
 women in childbirth, and this shall endure for five days and four nights - to
 the ninth generation the curse shall be upon you." And so it came to pass;
 and this is the cause of the Debility of the Ultonians that was wont to afflict
 the warriors of the province.</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 Conor mac Nessa</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The chief occasion on which this Debility was
 manifested was when Maev, Queen of Connacht, made the famous Cattle-raid of
 Quelgny <i>(Tam Bo Cuailgné</i>)<i>, </i>which forms the subject of the
 greatest tale in Irish literature. We have now to relate the preliminary history
 leading up to this epic tale and introducing its chief characters.</p>
 
 <p>
 Fachtna the Giant, King of Ulster, had to
 wife Nessa, daughter of Echid Yellow-heel, and she bore him a son named Conor.
 But when Fachtna died Fergus son of Roy, his half-brother, succeeded him, Conor
 being then but a youth. Now Fergus loved Nessa, and would have wedded her, but
 she made conditions. "Let my son Conor reign one year," she said,
 "so that his posterity may be the descendants of a king, and I
 consent." Fergus agreed, and young Conor took the throne. But so wise and
 prosperous was his rule and so sagacious his judgments that, at the year's end,
 the people, as Nessa foresaw, would have him remain king; and Fergus, who loved
 the feast and the chase better than the toils of kingship, was content to have
 it so, and remained at Conor's court for a time, great, honoured, and happy, but
 king no longer.</p>
 
 <p>

 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Red Branch</p>
 
 
 <p>
 In his time was the glory of the "Red
 Branch" in Ulster, who were the offspring of Ross the Red, King of Ulster,
 with collateral relatives and allies, forming ultimately a kind of warlike
 Order. Most of the Red Branch heroes appear in the Ultonian Cycle of legend, so
 that a statement of their names and relationships may be usefully placed here
 before we proceed to speak of their doings. It is noticeable that they have a
 partly supernatural ancestry. Ross the Red, it is said, wedded a Danaan woman,
 Maga, daughter of Angus Og [see page 121 - 123 for an account of this deity]. As
 a second wife he wedded a maiden named Roy. His descendants are as follows:</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 But Maga was also wedded to the Druid
 Cathbad, and by<i> </i>him had three daughters, whose descendants played a
 notable part in the Ultonian legendary cycle.</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 [Dectera also had a mortal husband, Sualtam,
 who passed as Cuchulain's father.]</p>
 
 <p>
 [181]</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 Birth of Cuchulain</p>
 
 
 <p>
 It was during the reign of Conor mac Nessa
 that the birth of the mightiest hero of the Celtic race, Cuchulain, came about,
 and this was the manner of it. The maiden Dectera, daughter of Cathbad, with
 fifty young girls, her companions at the court of Conor, one day disappeared,
 and for three years no searching availed to discover their dwelling-place or
 their fate. At last one summer day a flock of birds descended on the fields
 about Emain Macha and began to destroy the crops and fruit. The king, with
 Fergus and others of his nobles, went out against them with slings, but the
 birds flew only a little way off<i>, </i>luring the party on and on till at last
 they found themselves near the Fairy Mound of Angus on the river Boyne. Night
 fell, and the king sent Fergus with a party to discover some habitation where
 they might sleep. A hut was found, where they betook themselves to rest, but one
 of them, exploring further, came to a noble mansion by the river, and on
 entering it was met by a young man of splendid appearance. With the stranger was
 a lovely woman, his wife, and fifty maidens, who saluted the Ulster warrior with
 joy. And he recognised in them Dectera and her maidens, whom they had missed for
 three years, and in the glorious youth Lugh of the Long Arm, son of Ethlinn. He
 went back with his tale to the king, who immediately sent for Dectera to come to
 him. She, alleging that she was ill, requested a delay; and so the night passed
 ; but in the morning there was found in the hut among the Ulster warriors a
 new-born male infant. It was Dectera's gift to Ulster, and for this purpose she
 had lured them to the fairy palace by the Boyne. The child was taken home by the
 warriors and was given to Dectera's sister, Finchoom, who was then</p>
 
 <p>
 [182]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 nursing her own child, Conall, and the boy's
 name was called Setanta. And the part of Ulster from Dundalk southward to Usna
 in Meath, which is called the Plain of Murthemney, was allotted for his
 inheritance, and in later days his fortress and dwelling-place was in Dundalk.</p>
 
 <p>
 It is said that the Druid Morann prophesied
 over the infant : "His praise will be in the mouths of all men charioteers
 and warriors, kings and sages will recount his deeds; he will win the love of
 many. This child will avenge all your wrongs; he will give combat at your fords,
 he will decide all your quarrels."</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 The Hound of CuIlan</p>
 
 
 <p>
 When he was old enough the boy Setanta went
 to the court of Conor to be brought up and instructed along with the other sons
 of princes and chieftains. It was now that the event occurred from which he got
 the name of Cuchulain, by which he was hereafter to be known.</p>
 
 <p>
 One afternoon King Conor and his nobles were
 going to a feast to which they were bidden at the dun of a wealthy smith named
 Cullan, in Quelgny, where they also meant to spend the night. Setanta was to
 accompany them, but as the cavalcade set off he was in the midst of a game of
 hurley with his companions and bade the king go forward, saying he would follow
 later when his play was done. The royal company arrived at their destination as
 night began to fall. Cullan received them hospitably, and in the great hall they
 made merry over meat and wine while the lord of the house barred the gates of
 his fortress and let loose outside a huge and ferocious dog which every night
 guarded the lonely mansion, and under whose protection, it was said, Cullan
 feared nothing less than the onset of an army.</p>
 
 <p>
 [183]</p>
 
 <p>
 But they had forgotten Setanta ! In the
 middle of the laughter and music of the feast a terrible sound was heard which
 brought every man to his feet in an instant. It was the tremendous baying of the
 hound of Cullan, giving tongue as it saw a stranger approach. Soon the noise
 changed to the howls of a fierce combat, but, on rushing to the gates, they saw
 in the glare of the lanterns a young boy and the hound lying dead at his feet.
 When it flew at him he had seized it by the throat and dashed its life out
 against the side-posts of the gate. The warriors bore in the lad with rejoicing
 and wonder, but soon the triumph ceased, for there stood their host, silent and
 sorrowful over the body of his faithful friend, who had died for the safety of
 his house and would never guard it more.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Give me," then said the lad
 Setanta, "a whelp of that hound, O Cullan, and I will train him to be all
 to you that his sire was. And until then give me shield and spear and I will
 myself guard your house; never hound guarded it better than I will."</p>
 
 <p>
 And all the company shouted applause at the
 generous pledge, and on the spot, as a commemoration of his first deed of
 valour, they named the lad Cuchulain. [It is noticeable that among the
 characters figuring in the Ultonian legendary cycle many names occur of which
 the word <i>Cn </i>(hound) forms a part. Thus we have Curoi, Cucorb, Beälcu,
 &amp;c. The reference is no doubt to the Irish wolf-hound, a fine type of valour
 and beauty.] the Hound of Cullan, and by that name he was known until he died.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Cuchulain Assumes Arms</p>
 
 
 <p>
 When he was older, and near the time when he
 might assume the weapons of manhood, it chanced one day that he passed close by
 where Cathbad the Druid</p>
 
 <p>
 [184]</p>
 
 <p>
 was teaching to certain of his pupils the art
 of divination and augury. One of them asked of Cathbad for what kind of
 enterprise that same day might be favourable ; and Cathbad, having worked a
 spell of divination, said : "The youth who should take up arms on this day
 would become of all men in Erin most famous for great deeds, yet will his life
 be short and fleeting." Cuchulain passed on as though he marked it not, and
 he came before the king. "What wilt thou ?" asked Conor. "To take
 the arms of manhood," said Cuchulain. "So he it," said the king,
 and he gave the lad two great spears. But Cuchulain shook them in his hand, and
 the staves splintered and broke. And so he did with many others ; and the
 chariots in which they set him to drive he broke to pieces with stamping of his
 foot, until at last the king's own chariot of war and his two spears and sword
 were brought to the lad, and these he could not break, do what he would ; so
 this equipment he retained.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 His Courtship of Emer</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The young Cuchulain was by this grown so fair
 and noble a youth that every maid or matron on whom he looked was bewitched by
 him, and the men of Ulster bade him take a wife of his own. But none were
 pleasing to him, till at last he saw the lovely maiden Emer, daughter of
 Forgall, the lord of Lusca, [Now Lusk, a village on the coast a few miles north
 of Dublin.] and he resolved to woo her for his bride. So he bade harness his
 chariot, and with Laeg, his friend and charioteer, he journeyed to Dūn
 Forgall.</p>
 
 <p>
 As he drew near, the maiden was with her
 companions, daughters of the vassals of Forgall, and she was teaching them
 embroidery, for in that art she excelled all women. She had "the six gifts
 of</p>
 
 <p>
 [185]</p>
 
 <p>
 womanhood - the gift of beauty, the gift of
 voice, the gift of sweet speech, the gift of needlework) the gift of wisdom, and
 the gift of chastity."</p>
 
 <p>
 Hearing the thunder of horse-hoofs and the
 clangour of the chariot from afar, she bade one of the maidens go to the rampart
 of the Dun and tell her what she saw. "A chariot is coming on," said
 the maiden, "drawn by two steeds with tossing heads, fierce and powerful;
 one is grey, the other black. They breathe fire from their jaws, and the clods
 of turf they throw up behind them as they race are like a flock of birds that
 follow in their track. In the chariot is a dark, sad man, comeliest of the men
 of Erin. He is clad in a crimson cloak, with a brooch of gold, and on his back
 is a crimson shield with a silver rim wrought with figures of beasts. With him
 as his charioteer is a tall, slender, freckled man with curling red hair held by
 a fillet of bronze, with plates of gold at either side of his face. With a goad
 of red gold he urges the horses."</p>
 
 <p>
 When the chariot drew up Emer went to meet
 Cuchulain and saluted him. But when he urged his love upon her she told him of
 the might and the wiliness of her father Forgall, and of the strength of the
 champions that guarded her lest she should wed against his will. And when he
 pressed her more she said "I may not marry before my sister Fial, who is
 older than I. She is with me here - she is excellent in handiwork."
 "It is not Fial whom I love," said Cuchulain. Then as they were
 conversing he saw the breast of the maiden over the bosom of her smock, and said
 to her "Fair is this plain, the plain of the noble yoke." "None
 comes to this plain," said she, "who has not slain his hundreds, and
 thy deeds are still to do."</p>
 
 <p>
 So Cuchulain then left her, and drove back to
 Emain Macha.</p>
 
 <p>
 [186]</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 Cuchulain in the Land of Skatha</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Next day Cuchulain bethought himself how he
 could prepare himself for war and for the deeds of heroism which Emer had
 demanded of him. Now he had heard of a mighty woman-warrior named Skatha, who
 dwelt in the Land of Shadows, [owing to the similarity of the name the
 supernatural country of Skath:, "the Shadowy," was early identified
 with the islands of Skye, where the Cuchulain Peaks still bear witness to the
 legend.] and who could teach to young heroes who came to her wonderful feats of
 arms. So Cuchulain went overseas to find her, and many dangers he had to meet,
 black forests and desert plains to traverse, before he could get tidings of
 Skatha and her land. At last he came to the Plain of Ill-luck, where he could
 not cross without being mired in its bottomless bogs or sticky clay, and while
 he was debating what he should do he saw coming towards him a young man with a
 face that shone like the sun, [this of course, was Cuchulain's father, Lugh] and
 whose very look put cheerfulness and hope into his heart. The young man gave him
 a wheel and told him to roll it before him on the plain, and to follow it
 whithersoever it went. So Cuchulain set the wheel rolling, and as it went it
 blazed with light that shot like rays from its rim, and the heat of it made a
 firm path across the quagmire, where Cuchulain followed safely.</p>
 
 <p>
 When he had passed the Plain of Ill-luck, and
 escaped the beasts of the Perilous Glen, he came to the Bridge of the Leaps,
 beyond which was the country of Skatha. Here he found on the hither side many
 sons of the princes of Ireland who were come to learn feats of war from Skatha,
 and they were playing at hurley on the green. And among them was his friend
 Ferdia, son of the Firbolg, Daman; and they all asked him of</p>
 
 <p>
 [187]</p>
 
 <p>
 the news from Ireland. When he had told them
 all he asked Ferdia how he should pass to the dun of Skatha. Now the Bridge of
 Leaps was very narrow and very high, and it crossed a gorge where far below
 swung the tides of a boiling sea, in which ravenous monsters could be seen
 swimming.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Not one of us has crossed that
 bridge," said Ferdia, "for there are two feats that Skatha teaches
 last, and one is the leap across the bridge, and the other the thrust of the Gae
 Bolg. [this means probably "the belly spear." With this terrible
 weapon Cuchulain was fated in the end to slay his friend Ferdia.] For if a man
 step upon one end of that bridge, the middle straightway rises up and flings him
 back, and if he leap upon it he may chance to miss his footing and fall into the
 gulf, where the sea-monsters are waiting for him."</p>
 
 <p>
 But Cuchulain waited till evening, when he
 had recovered his strength from his long journey, and then essayed the crossing
 of the bridge. Three times he ran towards it from a distance, gathering all his
 powers together, and strove to leap upon the middle, but three times it rose
 against him and flung him back, while his companions jeered at him because he
 would not wait for the help of Skatha. But at the fourth leap he lit fairly on
 the centre of the bridge, and with one leap more he was across it, and stood
 before the strong fortress of Skatha; and she wondered at his courage and
 vigour, and admitted him to be her pupil.</p>
 
 <p>
 For a year and a day Cuchulain abode with
 Skatha, and all the feats she had to teach he learned easily, and last of all
 she taught him the use of the Gae Bolg, and gave him that dreadful weapon, which
 she had deemed no champion before him good enough to have. And the manner of
 using the Gae Boig was that it was thrown with the foot, and if it entered an
 enemy's</p>
 
 <p>
 [188]</p>
 
 <p>
 body it filled every limb and crevice of him
 with its barbs. While Cuchulain dwelt with Skatha his friend above all friends
 and his rival in skill and valour was Ferdia, and ere they parted they vowed to
 love and help one another as long as they should live.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Cuchulain and Aifa</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Now whilst Cuchulain was in the Land of the
 Shadows it chanced that Skatha made war on the people of the Princess Aifa, who
 was the fiercest and strongest of the woman-warriors of the world, so that even
 Skatha feared to meet her in arms. On going forth to the war, therefore, Skatha
 mixed with Cuchulain's drink a sleepy herb so that he should not wake for
 four-and-twenty hours, by which time the host would be far on its way, for she
 feared lest evil should come to him ere he had got his full strength. But the
 potion that would have served another man for a day and a night only held
 Cuchulain for one hour; and when he waked up he seized his arms and followed the
 host by its chariot-tracks till he came up with them. Then it is said that
 Skatha uttered a sigh, for she knew that he would not be restrained from the
 war.</p>
 
 <p>
 When the armies met, Cuchulain and the two
 sons of Skatha wrought great deeds on the foe, and slew six of the mightiest of
 Aifa's warriors. Then Aifa sent word to Skatha and challenged her to single
 combat. But Cuchulain declared that he would meet the fair Fury in place of
 Skatha, and he asked first of all what were the things she most valued.
 "What Aifa loves most," said Skatha, "are her two horses, her
 chariot and her charioteer." Then the pair met in single combat, and every
 champion's feat which they knew they tried on each other in vain, till at last a
 blow of Aifa's shattered the sword of Cuchulain to the hilt.</p>
 
 <p>
 [189]</p>
 
 <p>
 At this Cuchulain cried out: "Ah me !
 behold the chariot and horses of Aifa fallen into the glen !" Aifa glanced
 round, and Cuchulain, rushing in, seized her round the waist and slung her over
 his shoulder and bore her back to the camp of Skatha. There he flung her on the
 ground and put his knife to her throat. She begged for her life, and Cuchulain
 granted it on condition that she made a lasting peace with Skatha, and gave
 hostages for her fulfilment of the pledge. To this she agreed, and Cuchulain and
 she became not only friends but lovers.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Tragedy of Cuchulain and Connla</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Before Cuchulain left the Land of Shadows he
 gave Aifa a golden ring, saying that if she should bear him a son he was to be
 sent to seek his father in Erin so soon as he should have grown so that his
 finger would fit the ring. And Cuchulain said, "Charge him under <i>geise</i>
 that he shall not make himself known, that he never turn out of the way for any
 man, nor ever refuse a combat. And be his name called Connla."</p>
 
 <p>
 In later years it is narrated that one day
 when King Conor of Ulster and the lords of Ulster were at a festal gathering on
 the Strand of the Footprints they saw coming towards them across the sea a
 little boat of bronze, and in it a young lad with gilded oars in his hands. In
 the boat was a heap of stones, and ever and anon the lad would put one of these
 stones into a sling and cast it at a flying sea-bird in such fashion that it
 would bring down the bird alive to his feet. And many other wonderful feats of
 skill he did. Then Conor said, as the boat drew nearer: "If the grown men
 of that lad's country came here they would surely grind us to powder. Woe to the
 land into which that boy shall come !"</p>
 
 <p>
 [190]</p>
 
 <p>
 When the boy came to land, a messenger,
 Condery, was sent to bid him be off. "I will not turn back for thee,"
 said the lad, and Condery repeated what he had said to the king. Then Conall of
 the Victories was sent against him, but the lad slung a great stone at him, and
 the whizz and wind of it knocked him down, and the lad sprang upon him, and
 bound his arms with the strap of his shield. And so man after man was served;
 some were bound, and some were slain, but the lad defied the whole power of
 Ulster to turn him back, nor would he tell his name or lineage.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Send for Cuchulain," then said
 King Conor. And they sent a messenger to Dundalk, where Cuchulain was with Emer
 his wife, and bade him come to do battle against a stranger boy whom Conall of
 the Victories could not overcome. Emer threw her arm round Cuchulain's neck.
 "Do not go," she entreated. "Surely this is the son of Aifa. Slay
 not thine only son." But Cuchulain said: "Forbear, woman ! Were it
 Connla himself I would slay him for the honour of Ulster," and he bade yoke
 his chariot and went to the Strand. Here he found the boy tossing up his weapons
 and doing marvellous feats with them. "Delightful is thy play, boy,"
 said Cuchulain; "who art thou and whence dost thou come ?" "I may
 not reveal that," said the lad. "Then thou shalt die," said
 Cuchulain. "So be it," said the lad, and then they fought with swords
 for a while, till the lad delicately shore off a lock of Cuchulain's hair.
 "Enough of trifling," said Cuchulain, and they closed with each other,
 but the lad planted himself on 'a rock and stood so firm that Cuchulain could
 not move him, and in the stubborn wrestling they had the lad's two feet sank
 deep into the stone and made the footprints whence the Strand of the Footprints
 has its name. At last they both fell</p>
 
 <p>
 [191]</p>
 
 <p>
 into the sea, and Cuchulain was near being
 drowned, till he bethought himself of the Gae Bolg, and he drove that weapon
 against the lad and it ripped up his belly. "That is what Skatha never
 taught me," cried the lad. "Woe is me, for I am hurt." Cuchulain
 looked at him and saw the ring on his finger. " It is true," he said;
 and he took up the boy and bore him on shore and laid him down before Conor and
 the lords of Ulster. "Here is my son for you, men of Ulster," he said.
 And the boy said: "it is true. And if I had five years to grow among you,
 you would conquer the world on every side of you and rule as far as Rome. But
 since it is as it is, point out to me the famous warriors that are here, that I
 may know them and take leave of them before I die." Then one after another
 they were brought to him, and he kissed them and took leave of his father, and
 he died; and the men of Ulster made his grave and set up his pillar-stone with
 great mourning. This was the only son Cuchulain ever had, and this son he slew.</p>
 
 <p>
 This tale, as I have given it here, dates
 from the ninth century, and is found in the "Yellow Book of Lecan."
 There are many other Gaelic versions of it in poetry and prose. It is one of the
 earliest extant appearances in literature of the since well-known theme of the
 slaying of a heroic son by his father. The Persian rendering of it in the tale
 of Sohrab and Rustum has been made familiar by Matthew Arnold's fine poem. In
 the Irish version it will be noted that the father is not without a suspicion of
 the identity of his antagonist, but he does battle with him under the stimulus
 of that passionate sense of loyalty to his prince and province which was
 Cuchulain's most signal characteristic.</p>
 
 <p>
 To complete the story of Aifa and her son we
 have anticipated events, and now turn back to take up the thread again.</p>
 
 <p>
 [192]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Cuchulain's First Foray</p>
 
 
 <p>
 After a year and a day of training in warfare
 under Skatha, Cuchulain returned to Erin, eager to test his prowess and to win
 Emer for his wife. So he bade harness his chariot and drove out to make a foray
 upon the fords and marches of Connacht, for between Connacht and Ulster there
 was always an angry surf of fighting along the borders.</p>
 
 <p>
 And first he drove to the White Cairn, which
 is on the highest of the Mountains of Mourne, and surveyed the land of Ulster
 spread out smiling in the sunshine far below and bade his charioteer tell him
 the name of every hill and plain and dūn that he saw. Then turning
 southwards he looked over the plains of Bregia, and the charioteer pointed out
 to him Tara and Teltin, and Brugh na Boyna and the great dūn of the sons of
 Nechtan. "Are they," asked Cuchulain, "those sons of Nechtan of
 whom it is said that more of the men of Ulster have fallen by their hands than
 are yet living on the earth ?" "The same," said the charioteer.
 Then let us drive thither," said Cuchulain. So, much unwilling, the
 charioteer drove to the fortress of the sons of Nechtan, and there on the green
 before it they found a pillar-stone, and round it a collar of bronze having on
 it writing in Ogham. This Cuchulain read, and it declared that any man of age to
 bear arms who should come to that green should hold it <i>geis </i>for him to
 depart without having challenged one of the dwellers in the dūn to single
 combat. Then Cuchulain flung his arms round the stone, and, swaying it backwards
 and forwards, heaved it at last out of the earth and flung it, collar and all,
 into the river that ran hard by. "Surely," said the charioteer, "
 thou art seeking for a violent death, and now thou wilt find it without
 delay."</p>
 
 <p>
 [193]</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Then Foill son of Nechtan came forth from the dūn, and
 seeing Cuchulain, whom he deemed but a lad, he was annoyed. But Cuchulain bade
 him fetch his arms, "for I slay not drivers nor messengers nor unarmed
 men," and Foill went back into the dūn.</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "Thou canst not slay him," then
 said the charioteer, "for he is invulnerable by magic power to the point or
 edge of any blade." But Cuchulain put in his sling a ball of tempered iron,
 and when Foill appeared he slung at him so that it struck his forehead, and went
 clean through brain and skull; and Cuchulain took his head and bound it to his
 chariot-rim. And other sons of Nechtan, issuing forth, he fought with and slew
 by sword or spear; and then he fired the dūn and left it in a blaze and
 drove on exultant. And on the way he saw a flock of wild swans, and sixteen of
 them he brought down alive with his sling, and tied them to the chariot; and
 seeing a herd of wild deer which his horses could not overtake he lighted down
 and chased them on foot till he caught two great stags, and with thongs and
 ropes he made them fast to the chariot.</p>
 
 <p>
 But at Emain Macha a scout of King Conor came
 running in to give him news. "Behold, a solitary chariot is approaching
 swiftly over the plain; wild white birds flutter round it and wild stags are
 tethered to it; it is decked all round with the bleeding heads ot enemies."
 And Conor looked to see who was approaching, and he saw that Cuchulain was in
 his battle-fury, and would deal death around him whomsoever he met; so he
 hastily gave order that a troop of the women of Emania should go forth to meet
 him, and, having stripped off their clothing, should stand naked in the way.
 This they did, and when the lad saw them, smitten with shame, he bowed his head
 upon the chariot-rim. Then Conor's men instantly seized him</p>
 
 <p>
 [194]</p>
 
 <p>
 and plunged him into a vat of cold water
 which had been made ready, but the water boiled around him and the staves and
 hoops of the vat were burst asunder. This they did again and yet again, and at
 last his fury left him, and his natural form and aspect were restored. Then they
 clad him in fresh raiment and bade him in to the feast in the king's
 banqueting-hall.</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 The Winning of Emer</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Next day he went to the dūn of Forgall
 the Wily, father of Emer, and he leaped "the hero's salmon leap," that
 he had learned of Skatha, over the high ramparts of the dūn. Then the
 mighty men of Forgall set on him, and he dealt but three blows, and each blow
 slew eight men, and Forgall himself fell lifeless in leaping from the rampart of
 the dūn to escape Cuchulain. So he carried off Emer and her foster-sister
 and two loads of gold and silver. But outside the dun the sister of Forgall
 raised a host against him, and his battle-fury came on him, and furious were the
 blows he dealt, so that the ford of Glondath ran blood and the turf on Crofot
 was trampled into bloody mire. A hundred he slew at every ford from Olbiny to
 the Boyne ; and so was Emer won as she desired, and he brought her to Emain
 Macha and made her his wife, and they were not parted again until he died.</p>
 
 <p>

 Cuchulain Champion of Erin</p>
 
 
 <p>
 A lord of Ulster named Briccriu of the
 Poisoned Tongue once made a feast to which he bade King Conor and all the heroes
 of the Red Branch, and because it was always his delight to stir up strife among
 men or women he set the heroes contending among themselves as to who was the
 champion of the land of Erin. At last it was agreed that the championship</p>
 
 <p>
 [195]</p>
 
 <p>
 must lie among three of them, namely,
 Cuchulain, and Conall of the Victories and Laery the Triumphant. To decide
 between these three a demon named The Terrible was summoned from a lake in the
 depth of which he dwelt. He proposed to the heroes a test of courage. Any one of
 them, he said, might cut off his head to-day provided that he, the claimant of
 the championship, would lay down his own head for the axe to-morrow. Conall and
 Laery shrank from the test, but Cuchulain accepted it, and after reciting a
 charm over his sword, he cut off the head of the demon, who immediately rose,
 and taking the bleeding head in one hand and his axe in the other, plunged into
 the lake.</p>
 
 <p>
 Next day he reappeared, whole and sound, to
 claim the fulfilment of the bargain. Cuchulain, quailing but resolute, laid his
 head on the block. "Stretch out your neck, wretch," cried the demon ;
 "tis too short for me to strike at." Cuchulain does as he is bidden.
 The demon swings his axe thrice over his victim, brings down the butt with a
 crash on the block, and then bids Cuchulain rise unhurt, Champion of Ireland and
 her boldest man.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Deirdre and the Sons of Usna</p>
 
 
 <p>
 We have now to turn to a story in which
 Cuchulain takes no part. It is the chief of the preliminary tales to the
 Cattle-spoil of Quelgny.</p>
 
 <p>
 There was among the lords of Ulster, it is
 said, one named Felim son of Dall, who on a certain day made a great feast for
 the king. And the king came with his Druid Cathbad, and Fergus mac Roy, and many
 heroes of the Red Branch, and while they were making merry over the roasted
 flesh and wheaten cakes and Greek wine a messenger from the women's apartments</p>
 
 <p>
 [196]</p>
 
 <p>
 came to tell Felim that his wife had just
 borne him a daughter. So all the lords and warriors drank health to the new-born
 infant, and the king bade Cathbade perform divination in the manner of the
 Druids and foretell what the future would have in store for Felim's base.
 Cathbad gazed upon the stars and drew the horoscope of the child, and he was
 much troubled; and at length he said: "The infant shall he fairest among
 the women of Erin, and shall wed a king, but because of her shall death and ruin
 come upon the Province of Ulster." Then the warriors would have put her to
 death upon the spot, but Conor forbade them. "I will avert the doom,"
 he said, "for she shall wed no foreign king, but she shall he my own mate
 when she is of age." So he took away the child, and committed it to his
 nurse Levarcam, and the name they gave it was Deirdre. And Conor charged
 Levarcam that the child should be brought up in a strong dūn in the
 solitude of a great wood, and that no young man should see her or she him until
 she was of marriageable age for the king to wed. And there she dwelt, seeing
 none but her nurse and Cathbad, and sometime: the king, now growing an aged man,
 who would visit the dūn from time to time to see that all was well with the
 folk there, and that his commands were observed.</p>
 
 <p>
 One day, when the time for the marriage of
 Deirdre and Conor was drawing near, Deirdre and Levarcam looked over the rampart
 of their dun. It was winter, a heavy snow had fallen in the night, and in the
 still, frosty air the trees stood up as if wrought in silver, and the green
 before the dun was a sheet of unbroken white, save that in one place a scullion
 had killed a calf for their dinner, and the blood of the calf lay on the snow.
 And as Deirdre looked, a raven lit down from</p>
 
 <p>
 [197]</p>
 
 <p>
 a<i> </i>tree hard by and began to sip the
 blood. "O nurse," cried Deirdre suddenly, "such, and not like
 Conor, would be the man that I would love-his hair like the raven's wing, and in
 his cheek the hue of blood, and his skin as white as snow. "Thou hast
 pictured a man of Conor's household," said the nurse. "Who is he
 ?" asked Deirdre. "He is Naisi, son of Usna. [see genealogical table,
 p. 181] a champion of the Red Branch," said the nurse. Thereupon Deirdre
 entreated Levarcam to bring her to speak with Naisi; and because the old woman
 loved the girl and would not have her wedded to the aged king, she at last
 agreed. Deirdre implored Naisi to save her from Conor, but he would not, till at
 last her entreaties and her beauty won him, and he vowed to be hers. Then
 secretly one night he came with his two brethren, Ardan and Ainlé, and bore
 away Deirdre with Levarcam, and they escaped the king's pursuit and took ship
 for Scotland, where Naisi took service with the King of the Picts. Yet here they
 could not rest, for the king got sight of Deirdre, and would have taken her from
 Naisi, but Naisi with his brothers escaped, and in the solitude of Glen Etive
 they made their dwelling by the lake, and there lived in the wild wood by
 hunting and fishing, seeing no man but themselves and their servants.</p>
 
 <p>
 And the years went by and Conor made no sign,
 but he did not forget, and his spies told him of all that befell Naisi and
 Deirdre. At last, judging that Naisi and his brothers would have tired of
 solitude, he sent the bosom friend of Naisi, Fergus son of Roy, to bid them
 return, and to promise them that all would be forgiven. Fergus went joyfully,
 and joyfully did Naisi and his brothers hear the message, but Deirdre foresaw
 evil, and would fain have sent Fergus home alone.</p>
 
 <p>
 [198]</p>
 
 <p>
 But Naisi blamed her for her doubt and
 suspicion, and bade her mark that they were under the protection of Fergus,
 whose safeguard no king in Ireland would dare to violate; and they at last made
 ready to go.</p>
 
 <p>
 On landing in Ireland they were met by
 Baruch, a lord of the Red Branch, who had his dūn close by, and he bade
 Fergus to a feast he had prepared for him that night. " I may not
 stay," said Fergus, "for I must first convey Deirdre and the sons of
 Usna safely to Emain Macha" "Nevertheless," said Baruch,
 "thou must stay with me to-night, for it is a <i>geis </i>for thee to
 refuse a feast." Deirdre implored him not to leave them, but Fergus was
 tempted by the feast, and feared to break his <i>geis, </i>and he bade his two
 sons Illan the Fair and Buino the Red take charge of the party in his place, and
 he himself abode with Baruch.</p>
 
 <p>
 And so the party came to Emain Macha, and
 they were lodged in the House of the Red Branch, but Conor did not receive them.
 After the evening meal, as he sat, drinking heavily and silently, he sent a
 messenger to bid Levarcam come before him. "How is it with the sons of Usna
 ? " he said to her. "It is well," she said. "Thou hast got
 the three most valorous champions in Ulster in thy court. Truly the king who has
 those three need fear no enemy." "Is it well with Deirdre ?" he
 asked. "She is well," said the nurse, "but she has lived many
 years in the wildwood, and toil and care have changed her - little of her beauty
 of old now remains to her, O King." Then the king dismissed her, and sat
 drinking again. But after a while he called to him a servant named Trendorn, and
 bade him go to the Red Branch House and mark who was there and what they did.
 But when Trendorn came the place was bolted and barred for the night, and he
 could not get an entrance, and at last he</p>
 
 <p>
 [199]</p>
 
 <p>
 mounted on a ladder and looked in at a high
 window. And there he saw the brothers of Naisi and the sons of Fergus, as they
 talked or cleaned their arms, or made them ready for slumber, and there sat
 Naisi with a chess-board before him, and playing chess with him was the fairest
 of women that he had ever seen. But as he looked in wonder at the noble pair,
 suddenly one caught sight of him and rose with a cry, pointing to the face at
 the window. And Naisi looked up and saw it, and seizing a chessman from the
 board he hurled it at the face of the spy, and it struck out his eye. Then
 Trendorn hastily descended, and went back with his bloody face to the king.
 "I have seen them," he cried, "I have seen the fairest woman of
 the world, and but that Naisi had struck my eye out I had been looking on her
 still."</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Conor arose and called for his guards
 and bade them bring the sons of Usna before him for maiming his messenger. And
 the guards went; but first Buino,son of Fergus, with his retinue, met them, and
 at the sword's point drove them back; but Naisi and Deirdre continued quietly to
 play chess, "For," said Naisi, "it is not seemly that we should
 seek to defend ourselves while we are under the protection of the sons of
 Fergus." But Conor went to Buino, and with a great gift of lands he bought
 him over to desert his charge. Then Illan took up the defence of the Red Branch
 Hostel, but the two sons of Conor slew him. And then at last Naisi and his
 brothers seized their weapons and rushed amid the foe, and many were they who
 fell before the onset. Then Conor entreated Cathbad the Druid to cast spells
 upon them lest they should get away and become the enemies of the province, and
 he vowed to do them no hurt if they were taken alive. So Cathbad conjured up, as
 it were, a lake of slime that seemed to be about</p>
 
 <p>
 [200]</p>
 
 <p>
 the feet of the sons of Usna, and they could
 not tear their feet from it, and Naisi caught up Deirdre and put her on his
 shoulder, for they seemed to be sinking in the slime. Then the guards and
 servants of Conor seized and bound them and brought them before the king. And
 the king called upon man after man to come forward and slay the sons of Usna,
 but none would obey him, till at last Owen son of Duracht and Prince of Ferney
 came and took the sword of Naisi, and with one sweep he shore off the heads of
 all three, and so they died.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Conor took Deirdre perforce, and for a
 year she abode with him in the palace in Emain Macha, but during all that time
 she never smiled. At length Conor said: "What is it that you hate most of
 all on earth, Deirdre ?" And she said : "Thou thyself and Owen son of
 Duracht," and Owen was standing by. "Then thou shalt go to Owen for a
 year," said Conor. But when Deirdre mounted the chariot behind Owen she
 kept her eyes on the ground, for she would not look on those who thus tormented
 her; and Conor said, taunting her : "Deirdre, the glance of thee between me
 and Owen is the glance of a ewe between two rams." Then Deirdre started up,
 and, flinging herself head foremost from the chariot, she dashed her head
 against a rock and fell dead.</p>
 
 <p>
 And when they buried her it is said there
 grew from her grave and from Naisi's two yew-trees, whose tops, when they were
 full-grown, met each other over the roof of the great church of Armagh, and
 intertwined together, and none could part them.</p>
 
 <b>

 <br>
 
 The Rebellion of Fergus</p>
 
 
 <p>
 When Fergus mac Roy came home to Emain Macha
 after the feast to which Baruch bade him and found</p>
 
 <p>
 [201]</p>
 
 <p>
 the sons of Usna slain and one of his own
 sons dead and the other a traitor, he broke out against Conor in a storm of
 wrath and cursing, and vowed to be avenged on him with fire and sword. And he
 went off straightway to Connacht to take service of arms with Ailell and Maev,
 who were king and queen of that country.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Queen Maev</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But though Ailell was king, Maev was the
 ruler in truth, and ordered all things as she wished, and took what husbands she
 wished, and dismissed them at pleasure; for she was as fierce and strong as a
 goddess of war, and knew no law but her own wild will. She was tall, it is said,
 with a long, pale face and masses of hair yellow as ripe corn. When Fergus came
 to her in her palace at Rathcroghan in Roscommon she gave him her love, as she
 had given it to many before, and they plotted together how to attack and
 devastate the Province of Ulster.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Brown Bull of Quelgny</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Now it happened that Maev possessed a famous
 red bull with white front and horns named Finnbenach, and one day when she and
 Ailell were counting up their respective possessions and matching them against
 each other he taunted her because the Finnbenach would not stay in the hands of
 a woman, but had attached himself to Ailell's herd. So Maev in vexation went to
 her steward, mac Roth, and asked of him if there were anywhere in Erin a bull as
 fine as the Finnbenach. "Truly," said the steward, "there is -
 for the Brown Bull of Quelgny, that belongs to Dara son of Fachtna, is the
 mightiest beast that is in Ireland." And after that Maev felt as if she had
 no flocks and</p>
 
 <p>
 [202]</p>
 
 <p>
 herds that were worth anything at all unless
 she possessed the Brown Bull of Quelgny. But this was in Ulster, and the
 Ulstermen knew the treasure they possessed, and Maev knew that they would not
 give up the hull without fighting for it. So she and Fergus and Ailell agreed to
 make a foray against Ulster for the Brown Bull, and thus to enter into war with
 the province, for Fergus longed for vengeance, and Maev for fighting, for glory,
 and for the bull, and Audi to satisfy Maev.</p>
 
 <p>
 Here let us note that this contest for the
 bull, which is the ostensible theme of the greatest of Celtic legendary tales,
 the "Tam Bo Cuailgné," has a deeper meaning than appears on the
 surface. An ancient piece of Aryan mythology is embedded in it. The Brown Bull
 is the Celtic counterpart of the Hindu sky-deity, Indra, represented in Hindu
 myth as a mighty bull, whose roaring is the thunder and who lets loose the rains
 "like cows streaming forth to pasture." The advance of the Western
 (Connacht) host for the capture of this bull is emblematic of the onset of
 Night. The bull is defended by the solar hero Cuchulain, who, however, is
 ultimately overthrown and the bull is captured for a season. The two animals in
 the Celtic legend probably typify the sky in different aspects. They are
 described with a pomp and circumstance which shows that they are no common
 beasts. Once, we are told, they were swineherds of the people of Dana.
 "They had been successively transformed into two ravens, two sea-monsters,
 two warriors, two demons, two worms or animalculae, and finally into two
 kine." [Miss Hull, "The Cuchullin Saga," p. Ixxii, where the
 solar theory of the Brown Bull is dealt with at length.] The Brown Bull is
 described as having a back broad enough for fifty children to play on ; when he
 is angry with his keeper he stamps the</p>
 
 <p>
 [203]</p>
 
 <p>
 man thirty feet into the ground; he is
 likened to a sea wave, to a boar, to a dragon, a lion, the writer heaping up
 images of strength and savagery. We are therefore concerned with no ordinary
 cattle-raid, but with a myth, the features of which are discernible under the
 dressing given it by the fervid imagination of the unknown Celtic bard who
 composed the "Tain," although the exact meaning of every detail may be
 difficult to ascertain.</p>
 
 <p>
 The first attempt of Maev to get possession
 of the bull was to send an embassy to Dara to ask for the loan of him for a
 year, the recompense offered being fifty heifers, besides the bull himself back,
 and if Dara chose to settle in Connacht he should have as much land there as he
 now possessed in Ulster, and a chariot worth thrice seven <i>cumals, </i>[A <i>cumal</i>
 was the unit of value in Celtic Ireland. It is mentioned as such by St. Patrick.
 It meant the price of a woman-slave.] with the patronage and friendship of Maev.</p>
 
 <p>
 Dara was at first delighted with the
 prospect, but tales were borne to him of the chatter of Maev's messengers, and
 how they said that if the bull was not yielded willingly it would be taken by
 force; and he sent back a message of refusal and defiance. " 'Twas
 known," said Maev, "the bull will not be yielded by fair means; he
 shall now be won by foul." And so she sent messengers around on every side
 to summon her hosts for the Raid.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Hosting of Queen Maev</p>
 
 
 <p>
 And there came all the mighty men of Connacht
 - first the seven Mainés, sons of Ailell and Maev, each with his retinue; and
 Ket and Anluan, sons of Maga, with thirty hundreds of armed men; and
 yellow-haired Ferdia, with his company of Firbolgs, boisterous giants</p>
 
 <p>
 [204]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 who delighted in war and in strong ale. And
 there came also the allies of Maev - host of the men of Leinster, who so
 excelled the rest in warlike skill that they were broken up and distributed
 among the companies of Connacht, lest they should prove a danger to the host;
 and Cormac son of Conor, with Fergus mac Roy and other exiles from Ulster, who
 had revolted against Conor for his treachery to the sons of Usna.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Ulster under the Curse</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But before the host set forth towards Ulster
 Maev sent her<i> </i>spies into the land to tell her of the preparations there
 being made. And the spies brought back a wondrous tale, and one that rejoiced
 the heart of Maev, for they said that the Debility of the Ultonians [the curse
 laid on them by Macha. See p. 180] had descended on the province. Conor the king
 lay in pangs at Emain Macha, and his son Cuscrid in his island-fortress, and
 Owen Prince of Ferney was helpless as a child; Celtchar, the huge grey warrior,
 son of Uthecar Hornskin, and even Conall of the Victories, lay moaning and
 writhing on their beds, and there was no hand in Ulster that could lift a spear.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Prophetic Voices</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Nevertheless Maev went to her chief Druid,
 and demanded of him what her own lot in the war should be. And the Druid said
 only: "Whoever comes back in safety, or comes not, thou thyself shalt
 come." But on her journey back she saw suddenly standing before her
 chariot-pole a young maiden with tresses of yellow hair that fell below her
 knees, and clad in a mantle of green ; and with a shuttle of gold she wove a
 fabric upon a loom. "Who art thou, girl ?" said Maev,</p>
 
 <p>
 [205]</p>
 
 <p>
 "and what dost thou ?" "I am
 the prophetess, Fedelma, from the Fairy Mound of Croghan," said the maid,
 "and I weave the four provinces of Ireland together for the foray into
 Ulster." "How seest thou our host ? " asked Maev. "I see
 them all be-crimsoned, red," replied the prophetess. "Yet the Ulster
 heroes are all in their pangs - there is none that can lift a spear against
 us," said Maev. "I see the host all be-crimsoned," said Fedelma.
 "I see a man of small stature, but the hero's light is on his brow - a
 stripling young and modest, but in battle a dragon; he is like unto Cuchulain of
 Murthemney; he doth wondrous feats with his weapons ; by him your slain shall
 lie thickly." [Cuchulain, as the son of the god Lugh, was not subject to
 the curse of Macha which afflicted the other Ultonians.]</p>
 
 <p>
 At this the vision of the weaving maiden
 vanished, and Maev drove homewards to Rathcroghan wondering at what she had seen
 and heard.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Cuchulain Puts the Host under Geise</p>
 
 
 <p>
 On the morrow the host set forth, Fergus mac
 Roy leading them, and as they neared the confines of Ulster he bade them keep
 sharp watch lest Cuchulain of Murthemney, who guarded the passes of Ulster to
 the south, should fall upon them unawares. Now Cuchulain and his father Sualtam
 [His reputed father, the mortal husband of Dectera] were on the borders of the
 province, and Cuchulain, from a warning Fergus had sent him, suspected the
 approach of a great host, and bade Sualtam go northwards to Emania and warn the
 men of Ulster. But Cuchulain himself would not stay there, for he said he had a
 tryst to keep with a handmaid of the wife of Laery the <i>bodach </i>(farmer),
 so he went into the forest, and there, standing on one leg,</p>
 
 <p>
 [206]</p>
 
 <p>
 and using only one hand and one eye, he cut
 an oak sapling and twisted it into a circular withe. On this he cut in Ogham
 characters how the withe was made, and he put the host of Maev under <i>geise </i>not
 to pass by that place till one of them had, under similar conditions, made a
 similar withe ; "and I except my friend Fergus mac Roy," he added, and
 wrote his name at the end. Then he placed the withe round the pillar-stone of
 Ardcullin, and went his way to keep his tryst with the handmaid. [In the Irish
 bardic literature, as in the Homeric epics, chastity formed no part of the
 masculine ideal either for gods or men.]</p>
 
 <p>
 When the host of Maev came to Ardcullin, the
 withe upon the pillar-stone was found and brought to Fergus to decipher it.
 There was none amongst the host who could emulate the feat of Cuchulain, and so
 they went into the wood and encamped for the night. A heavy snowfall took place,
 and they were all in much distress, but next day the sun rose gloriously, and
 over the white plain they marched away into Ulster, counting the prohibition as
 extending only for one night.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Ford of the Forked Pole</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Cuchulain now followed hard on their track,
 and as he went he estimated by the tracks they had left the number of the host
 at eighteen <i>triucha cét </i>(54,000<i> </i>men). Circling round the host, he
 now met them in front, and soon came upon two chariots containing scouts sent
 ahead by Maev. These he slew, each man with his driver, and having with one
 sweep of his sword cut a forked pole of four prongs from the wood, he drove the
 pole deep into a river-ford at the place called Athgowla, ["The Ford of the
 Forked Pole"] and impaled on each prong a bloody head. When the host came
 up they wondered and feared at</p>
 
 <p>
 [207]</p>
 
 <p>
 the sight, and Fergus declared that they were
 under <i>geise </i>not to pass that ford till one of them had plucked out the
 pole even as it was driven in, with the finger-tips of one hand. So Fergus drove
 into the water to essay the feat, and seventeen chariots were broken under him
 as he tugged it the pole, but at list he tore it out; and as it was now late the
 host encamped upon the spot. These devices of Cuchulain were intended to delay
 the invaders until the Ulster men had recovered from their debility.</p>
 
 <p>
 In the epic, as given in the Book of
 Leinster, and other ancient sources, a long interlude now takes place in which
 Fergus explains to Maev who it is - viz., "my little pupil Setanta " -
 who is thus harrying the host, and his boyish deeds, some of which have been
 already told in this narrative, are recounted.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Charioteer of Orlam</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The host proceeded on its way next day, and
 the next encounter with Cuchulain showing. the hero in a kindlier mood. He hears
 a noise of timber being cut, and going into a wood he finds there a charioteer
 belonging to a son of Ailell and Maev cutting down chariot-poles of holly.
 "For," says he, "we have damaged our chariots sadly in chasing
 that furious deer, Cuchulain." Cuchulain - who, it must be remembered, was
 at ordinary times a slight and unimposing figure, though in battle he dilated in
 size and underwent a fearful distortion, symbolic of Berserker fury - helps the
 driver in his work. "Shall I," he asks, "cut the poles or trim
 them for thee?" "Do thou the trimming," says the driver.
 Cuchulain takes the poles by the tops and draws them against the set of the
 branches through his toes, and then runs his fingers down them the same way, and
 gives them over as smooth and</p>
 
 <p>
 [208]</p>
 
 <p>
 polished as if they were planed by a
 carpenter. The driver stares at him. "I doubt this work I set thee to is
 not thy proper work," he says. "Who art thou then at all?"
 "I am that Cuchulain of whom thou spakest but now " "Surely I am
 but a dead man," says the driver. " Nay," replies Cuchulain,
 "I slay not drivers nor messengers nor men unarmed. But run, tell thy
 master Orlam that Cuchulain is about to visit him." The driver runs off;
 but Cuchulain outstrips him, meets Orlam first, and strikes off his head. For a
 moment the host of Maev see him as he shakes this bloody trophy before them ;
 then he disappears from sight - it is the first glimpse they have caught of
 their persecutor.</p>

 The Battle-Frenzy of Cuchulain</p>
 
 
 <p>
 A number of scattered episodes now follow.
 The host of Maev spreads out and devastates the territories of Bregia and of
 Murthemney, but they cannot advance further into Ulster. Cuchulain hovers about
 them continually, slaying them by twos and threes, and no man knows where he
 will swoop next. Maev herself is awed when, by the bullets of an unseen slinger,
 a squirrel and a pet bird are killed as they sit upon her shoulders. Afterwards,
 as Cuchulain's wrath grows fiercer, he descends with supernatural might upon
 whole companies of the Connacht host, and hundreds fall at his onset. The
 characteristic distortion or <i>riastradh </i>which seized him in his
 battle-frenzy is then described. He became a fearsome and multiform creature
 such as never was known before. Every particle of him quivered like a bulrush in
 a running stream. His calves and heels and hams shifted to the front, and his
 feet and knees to the back, and the muscles of his neck stood out like the head
 of a young child. One</p>
 
 <p>
 [209]</p>
 
 <p>
 eye was engulfed deep in his head, the other
 protruded, his mouth met his ears, foam poured from his jaws like the fleece of
 a three-year-old wether. The beats of his heart sounded like the roars of a lion
 as he rushes on his prey. A light blazed above his head, and "his hair
 became tangled about as it had been the branches of a red thorn-bush stuffed
 into the gap of a fence </p>
 
 <p>
 Taller, thicker, more rigid, longer than the
 mast of a great ship was the perpendicular jet of dusky blood which out of his
 scalp's very central point shot upwards and was there scattered to the four
 cardinal points, whereby was formed a magic mist of gloom resembling the smoky
 pall that drapes a regal dwelling, what time a king at nightfall of a winter's
 day draws near to it." [I quote from Standish Hayes O'Grady's translation,
 in Miss Hull's "Cuchullin Saga."]</p>
 
 <p>
 Such was the imagery by which Gaelic writers
 conveyed the idea of superhuman frenzy. At the sight of Cuchulain in his
 paroxysm it is said that once a hundred of Maev's warriors fell dead from
 horror.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Compact of the Ford</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Maev now tried to tempt him by great largesse
 to desert the cause of Ulster, and had a colloquy with him, the two standing on
 opposite sides of a glen across which they talked. She scanned him closely, and
 was struck by his slight and boyish appearance. She failed to move him from his
 loyalty to Ulster, and death descends more thickly than ever upon the Connacht
 host ; the men are afraid to move out for plunder save in twenties and thirties,
 and at night the stones from Cuchulain's sling whistle continually through the
 camp, braining or maiming. At last, through the mediation of Fergus, an
 agreement was come to. Cuchulain undertook not to harry the host provided they
 would</p>
 
 <p>
 [210]</p>
 
 <p>
 only send against him one champion at a time,
 whom Cuchulain would meet in battle at the ford of the River Dee, which is now
 called the Ford of Ferdia. [<i>Ath Fherdia, </i>which is pronounced and now
 spelt "Ardee." It is in Co. Louth, at the southern border of the Plain
 of Murthemney, which was Cuchulain's territory.] While each right was in
 progress the host might move on, but when it was ended they must encamp till the
 morrow morning. "Better to lose one man a day than a hundred," said
 Maev, and the pact was made.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Fergus and Cuchulain</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Several single combats are then narrated, in
 which Cuchulain is always a victor. Maev even persuades Fergus to go against
 him, but Fergus and Cuchulain will on no account right each other, and
 Cuchulain, by agreement with Fergus, pretends to fly before him, on Fergus's
 promise that he will do the same for Cuchulain when required. How this pledge
 was kept we shall see later.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Capture of the Brown Bull</p>
 
 
 <p>
 During one of Cuchulain's duels with a famous
 champion, Natchrantal, Maev, with a third of her army, makes a sudden foray into
 Ulster and penetrates as far as Dunseverick, on the northern coast, plundering
 and ravaging as they go. The Brown Bull, who was originally at Quelgny (Co.
 Down), has been warned at an earlier stage by the Morrigan [see p. 126] to
 withdraw himself, and he has taken refuge, with his herd of cows, in a glen of
 Slievegallion, Co. Armagh. The raiders of Maev find him there, and drive him off
 with the herd in triumph, passing Cuchulain as they return. Cuchulain slays the
 leader of the escort - Buic son of Banblai - but cannot</p>
 
 <p>
 [211]</p>
 
 <p>
 rescue the Bull, and "this," it is
 said, "was the greatest affront put on Cuchulain during the course of the
 raid."</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Morrigan</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The raid ought now to have ceased, for its
 object has been attained, but by this time the hostings of the four southern
 provinces [In ancient Ireland there were five provinces, Munster being counted
 as<i> </i>two, or, as some ancient authorities explain it, the High King's
 territory in Meath and Westmeath being reckoned a separate province.] had
 gathered together under Maev for the plunder of Ulster, and Cuchulain remained
 still the solitary warder of the marches. Nor did Maev keep her agreement, for
 bands of twenty warriors at a time were loosed against him and he had much ado
 to defend himself. The curious episode of the fight with the Morrigan now
 occurs. A young woman clad in a mantle of many colours appears to Cuchulain,
 telling him that she is a king's daughter, attracted by the tales of his great
 exploits, and she has come to offer him her love. Cuchulain tells her rudely
 that he is worn and harassed with war and has no mind to concern himself with
 women. " It shall go hard with thee," then said the maid, "when
 thou hast to do with men, and I shall be about thy feet as an eel in the bottom
 of the Ford." Then she and her chariot vanished from his sight and he saw
 but a crow sitting on a branch of a tree, and he knew that he had spoken with
 the Morrigan.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Fight with Loch</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The next champion sent against him by Maev
 was Loch son of Mofebis. To meet this hero it is said that Cuchulain had to
 stain his chin with blackberry juice so as to simulate a beard, lest Loch should
 disdain to do combat with a boy. So they fought in the Ford, and the</p>
 
 <p>
 [212]</p>
 
 <p>
 Morrigan came against him in the guise of a
 white heifer with red ears, but Cuchulain fractured her eye with a cast of his
 spear. Then she came swimming up the river like a black eel and twisted herself
 about his legs, and ere he could rid himself of her Loch wounded him. Then she
 attacked him as a grey wolf, and again, before he could subdue her, he was
 wounded by Loch. At this his battle-fury took hold of him and he drove the Gae
 Bolg against Loch, splitting his heart in two. "Suffer me to rise,"
 said Loch, "that I may fall on my face on thy side of the ford, and not
 backward toward the men of Erin." "It is a warrior's boon thou
 askest," said Cuchulain, "and it is granted." So Loch died; and a
 great despondency, it is said, now fell upon Cuchulain, for he was outwearied
 with continued fighting, and sorely wounded, and he had never slept since the
 beginning of the raid, save leaning upon his spear; and he sent his charioteer,
 Laeg, to see if he could rouse the men of Ulster to come to his aid at last.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Lugh the Protector</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But as he lay at evening by the grave-mound
 of Lerga in gloom and dejection, watching the camp-fires of the vast army
 encamped over against him and the glitter of their innumerable spears, he saw
 coming through the host a tall and comely warrior who strode impetuously
 forward, and none of the companies through which he passed turned his head to
 look at him or seemed to see him. He wore a tunic of silk embroidered with gold,
 and a green mantle fastened with a silver brooch; in one hand was a black shield
 bordered with silver and two spears in the other. The stranger came to Cuchulain
 and spoke gently and sweetly to him of his long toil and waking, and his sore
 wounds, and said in the end:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Sleep now, Cuchulain, by the grave in
 Lerga; sleep</p>
 
 <p>
 [213]</p>
 
 <p>
 and slumber deeply for three days, and for
 that time I will take thy place and defend the Ford against the host of
 Maev." Then Cuchulain sank into a profound slumber and trance, and the
 stranger laid healing balms of magical power to his wounds so that he awoke
 whole and refreshed, and for the time that Cuchulain slept the stranger held the
 Ford against the host. And Cuchulain knew that this was Lugh his father, who had
 come from among the People of Dana to help his son through his hour of gloom and
 despair.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Sacrifice of the Boy Corps</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But still the men of Ulster lay helpless. Now
 there was at Emain Macha a band of thrice fifty boys, the sons of all the
 chieftains of the provinces, who were there being bred up in arms and in noble
 ways, and these suffered not from the curse of Macha, for it fell only on grown
 men. But when they heard of the sore straits in which Cuchulain, their playmate
 not long ago, was lying they put on their light armour and took their weapons
 and went forth for the honour of Ulster, under Conor's young son, Follaman, to
 aid him. And Follaman vowed that he would never return to Emania without the
 diadem of Ailell as a trophy. Three times they drove against the host of Maev,
 and thrice their own number fell before them, but in the end they were
 overwhelmed and slain, not one escaping alive.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Carnage of Murthemney</p>
 
 
 <p>
 This was done as Cuchulain lay in his trance,
 and when he awoke, refreshed and well, and heard what had been done, his frenzy
 came upon him and he leaped into his war-chariot and drove furiously round and
 round the host of Maev. And the chariot ploughed the earth till the ruts were
 like the ramparts of a</p>
 
 <p>
 [214]</p>
 
 <p>
 fortress, and the scythes upon its wheels
 caught and mangled the bodies of the crowded host till they were piled like a
 wall around the camp, and as Cuchulain shouted in his wrath the demons and
 goblins and wild things in Erin yelled in answer, so that with the terror and
 the uproar the host of men heaved and surged hither and thither, and many
 perished from each other's weapons, and many from horror and fear. And this was
 the great carnage, called the Carnage of Murthemney, that Cuchulain did to
 avenge the boy-corps of Emania ; six score and ten princes were then slain of
 the host of Maev, besides horses and women and wolf-dogs and common folk without
 number. It is said that Lugh mac Ethlinn fought there by his son.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Clan Calatin</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Next the men of Erin resolved to send against
 Cuchulain, in single combat, the Clan Calatin. ["Clan" in Gaelic means
 children or offspring. Clan Calatin = the sons of Calatin] Now Calatin was a
 wizard, and he and his seven-and-twenty sons formed, as it were, but one being,
 the sons being organs of their father, and what any one of them did they all did
 alike. They were all poisonous, so that any weapon which one of them used would
 kill in nine days the man who was but grazed by it. When this multiform creature
 met Cuchulain each hand of it hurled a spear at once, but Cuchulain caught the
 twenty-eight spears on his shield and not one of them drew blood. Then he drew
 his sword to lop off the spears that bristled from his shield, but as he did so
 the Clan Calatin rushed upon him and flung him down, thrusting his face into the
 gravel. At this Cuchulain gave a great cry of distress at the unequal combat,
 and one of</p>
 
 <p>
 [215]</p>
 
 <p>
 the Ulster exile; Fiacha son of Firaba, who
 was with the host of Maev, and was looking on at the fight, could not endure to
 see the plight of the champion, and he drew his sword and with one stroke he
 lopped off the eight-and-twenty hands that were grinding the face of Cuchulain
 into the gravel of the Ford. Then Cuchulain arose and hacked the Clan Calatin
 into fragments, so that none survived to tell Maev what Fiacha had done, else
 had he and his thirty hundred followers of Clan Rury heen given by Maev to the
 edge of the sword.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Ferdia to the Fray</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Cuchulain had now overcome all the mightiest
 of Maev's men, save only the mightiest of them all after Fergus, Ferdia son of
 Daman. And because Ferdia was the old friend and fellow pupil of Cuchulain he
 had never gone out against him; but now Maev begged him to go, and he would not.
 Then she offered him her daughter, Findabair of the Fair Eyebrows, to wife, if
 he would face Cuchulain at the Ford, but he would not. At last she bade him go,
 lest the poets and satirists of Erin should make verses on him and put him to
 open shame, and then in wrath and sorrow he consented to go, and bade his
 charioteer make ready for to-morrow's fray. Then was gloom among all his people
 when they heard of that, for they knew that if Cuchulain and their master met,
 one of them would return alive no more.</p>
 
 <p>
 Very early in the morning Ferdia drove to the
 Ford, and lay down there on the cushions and skins of the chariot and slept till
 Cuchulain should come. Not till it was full daylight did Ferdia's charioteer
 hear the thunder of Cuchulain's war-car approaching, and then he woke his
 master, and the two friends faced each</p>
 
 <p>
 [216]</p>
 
 <p>
 other across the Ford. And when they had
 greeted each other Cuchulain said: "It is not thou, O Ferdia, who shouldst
 have come to do battle with me. When we were with Skatha did we not go side by
 side in every battle, through every wood and wilderness ? were we not
 heart-companions, comrades, in the feast and the assembly ? did we not share one
 bed and one deep slumber ?" But Ferdia replied : "O Cuchulain, thou of
 the wondrous feats, though we have studied poetry and science together, and
 though I have heard thee recite our deeds of friendship, yet it is my hand that
 shall wound thee. I bid thee remember not our comradeship, O Hound of Ulster; it
 shall not avail thee, it shall not avail thee."</p>
 
 <p>
 They then debated with what weapons they
 should begin the fight, and Ferdia reminded Cuchulain of the art of casting
 small javelins that they had learned from Skatha, and they agreed to begin with
 these. Back-wards and forwards, then, across the Ford, hummed the light javelins
 like bees on a summer's day, but when noonday had come not one weapon had
 pierced the defence of either champion. Then they took to the heavy missile
 spears, and now at last blood began to flow, for each champion wounded the other
 time and again. At last the day came to its close. "Let us cease now,"
 said Ferdia, and Cuchulain agreed. Each then threw his arms to his charioteer,
 and the friends embraced and kissed each other three times, and went to their
 rest. Their horses were in the same paddock, their drivers warmed themselves
 over the same fire, and the heroes sent each other food and drink and healing
 herbs for their wounds.</p>
 
 <p>
 Next day they betook themselves again to the
 Ford, and this time, because Ferdia had the choice of weapons the day before, he
 bade Cuchulain take it</p>
 
 <p>
 [217]</p>
 
 <p>
 now. [Together with much that is wild and
 barbaric in this Irish epic of the "Tain" the reader will be struck by
 the ideals of courtesy and gentleness which not infrequently come to light in
 it. It must be remembered that, as Mr. A. H. Leahy points out in his "
 Heroic Romances of Ireland," the legend of the Raid of Quelgny is, at the
 very latest, a century earlier than all other known romances of chivalry Welsh
 or Continental. It is found in the "Book of Leinster," a<i> </i>manuscript
 of the twelfth century, as well as in other sources, and was doubtless
 considerably older than the date of its transcription there. "The whole
 thing," says Mr. Leahy, "stands at the very beginning of the
 literature of modern Europe."] Cuchulain chose then the heavy, broad-bladed
 spears for close fighting, and with them they fought from the chariots till the
 sun went down, and drivers and horses were weary, and the body of each hero was
 torn with wounds. Then at last they gave over, and threw away their weapons. And
 they kissed each other as before, and as before they shared all things at night,
 and slept peacefully till the morning.</p>
 
 <p>
 When the third day of the combat came Ferdia
 wore an evil and lowering look, and Cuchulain reproached him for coming out in
 battle against his comrade for the bribe of a fair maiden, even Findabair, whom
 Maev had offered to every champion and to Cuchulain himself if the Ford might be
 won thereby; but Ferdia said : "Noble Hound, had I not faced thee when
 summoned, my troth would be broken, and there would be shame on me in
 Rathcroghan." It is now the turn of Ferdia to choose the weapons, and they
 betake themselves to their " heavy, hard-smiting swords, and though they
 hew from each other's thighs and shoulders great cantles of flesh, neither can
 prevail over the other, and at last night ends the combat. This time they parted
 from each other in heaviness and gloom, and there was no interchange of friendly
 acts, and their drivers and horses slept apart. The passions of the warriors had
 now risen to a grim sternness.</p>
 
 <p>
 [218]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Death of Ferdia</p>
 
 
 <p>
 On the fourth day Ferdia knew the contest
 would be decided, and he armed himself with especial care. Next his skin was a
 tunic of striped silk bordered with golden spangles, and over that hung an apron
 of brown leather. Upon his belly he laid a flat stone, large as a millstone, and
 over that a strong, deep apron of iron, for he dreaded that Cuchulain would use
 the Gae Bolg that day. And he put on his head his crested helmet studded with
 carbuncle and inlaid with enamels, and girt on his golden-hilted sword, and on
 his left arm hung his broad shield with its fifty bosses of bronze. Thus he
 stood by the Ford, and as he waited he tossed up his weapons and caught them
 again and did many wonderful feats, playing with his mighty weapons as a juggler
 plays with apples; and Cuchulain, watching him, said to Laeg, his driver
 "If I give ground to-day, do thou reproach and mock me and spur me on to
 valour, and praise and hearten me if I do well, for I shall have need of all my
 courage.</p>
 
 <p>
 "O Ferdia," said Cuchulain when
 they met, "what shall be our weapons to-day ?" "It is thy choice
 today," said Ferdia. "Then let it be all or any," said Cuchulain,
 and Ferdia was cast down at hearing this, but he said, "So be it," and
 thereupon the fight began. Till midday they fought with spears, and none could
 gain any advantage over the other. Then Cuchulain drew his sword and sought to
 smite Ferdia over the rim of his shield ; but the giant Firbolg flung him off<i>.
 </i>Thrice Cuchulain leaped high into the air, seeking to strike Ferdia over his
 shield, but each time as he descended Ferdia caught him upon the shield and
 flung him off like a little child into the Ford. And Laeg mocked him, crying :
 "He casts thee off as a river flings</p>
 
 <p>
 [219]</p>
 
 <p>
 its foam, he grinds thee as a millstone
 grinds a corn of wheat ; thou elf, never call thyself a warrior."</p>
 
 <p>
 Then at last Cuchulain's frenzy came upon
 him, and he dilated giant-like, till he overtopped Ferdia, and the hero-light
 blazed about his head. In close contact the two were interlocked, whirling and
 trampling, while the demons and goblins and unearthly things of the glens
 screamed from the edges of their swords, and the waters of the Ford recoiled in
 terror from them, so that for a while they fought on dry land in the midst of
 the riverbed. And now Ferdia found Cuchulain a moment oft his guard, and smote
 him with the edge of the sword, and it sank deep into his flesh, and all the
 river ran red with his blood. And he pressed Cuchulain sorely after that, hewing
 and thrusting so that Cuchulain could endure it no longer, and he shouted to
 Laeg to fling him the Gae BoIg. When Ferdia heard that he lowered his shield to
 guard himself from below, and Cuchulain drove his spear over the rim of the
 shield and through his breastplate into his chest. And Ferdia raised his shield
 again, but in that moment Cuchulain seized the Gae Bolg in his toes and drove it
 upward against Ferdia, and it pierced through the iron apron and burst in three
 the millstone that guarded him, and deep into his body it passed, so that every
 crevice and cranny of him was filled with its barbs. " 'Tis enough,"
 cried Ferdia; " I have my death of that. It is an ill deed that I fall by
 thy hand, O Cuchulain." Cuchulain seized him as he fell, and carried him
 northward across the Ford, that he might die on the further side of it, and not
 on the side of the men of Erin. Then he laid him down, and a faintness seized
 Cuchulain, and he was falling, when Laeg cried : "Rise up, Cuchulain, for
 the host of Erin will be upon us. No single combat will they give after Ferdia
 has fallen." But Cuchulain said: "Why should</p>
 
 <p>
 [220]</p>
 
 <p>
 I rise again, O my servant, now he that lieth
 here has fallen by my hand ?" and he fell in a swoon like death. And the
 host of Maev with tumult and rejoicing, with tossing of spears and shouting of
 war-songs, poured across the border into Ulster.</p>
 
 <p>
 But before they left the Ford they took the
 body of Ferdia and laid it in a grave, and built a mound over him and set up a
 pillar-stone with his name and lineage in Ogham<i>. </i>And from Ulster came
 certain of the friends of Cuchulain, and they bore him away into Murthemney,
 where they washed him and bathed his wounds in the streams, and his kin among
 the Danaan Folk cast magical herbs into the rivers for his healing. But he lay
 there in weakness and in stupor for many days.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Rousing of Ulster</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Now Sualtam, the father of Cuchulain, had
 taken his son's horse, the Grey of Macha, and ridden off again to see if by any
 means he might rouse the men of Ulster to defend the province. And he went
 crying abroad "The men of Ulster are being slain, the women carried
 captive, the kine driven ! " Yet they stared on him stupidly, as though
 they knew not of what he spake. At last he came to Emania, and there were
 Cathbad the Druid and Conor the King, and all their nobles and lords, and
 Sualtam cried aloud to them : "The men of Ulster are being slain, the women
 carried captive, the kine driven ; and Cuchulain alone holds the gap of Ulster
 against the four provinces of Erin. Arise and defend yourselves I" But
 Cathbad only said "Death were the due of him who thus disturbs the
 King"; and Conor said : " Yet it is true what the man says"; and
 the lords of Ulster wagged their heads and murmured: "True indeed it
 is."</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Sualtam wheeled round his horse in anger
 and</p>
 
 <p>
 [221]</p>
 
 <p>
 was about to depart when, with a start which
 the Grey made, his neck fell against the sharp rim of the shield upon his back,
 and it shore off his head, and the head fell on the ground. Yet still it cried
 its message as it lay, and at last Conor bade put it on a pillar that it might
 be at rest. But it still went on crying and exhorting, and at length into the
 clouded mind of the king the truth began to penetrate, and the glazed eyes of
 the warriors began to glow, and slowly the spell of Macha's curse was lifted
 from their minds and bodies. Then Conor arose and swore a mighty oath, saying
 "The heavens are above us and the earth beneath us, and the sea is round
 about us; and surely, unless the heavens fall on us and the earth gape to
 swallow us up, and the sea overwhelm the earth, I will restore every woman to
 her hearth, and every cow to its byre." [Another instance of the survival
 of the oath formula recited by the Celtic envoys to Alexander the Great. See
 p.23.] His Druid proclaimed that the hour was propitious, and the king bade his
 messengers go forth on every side and summon Ulster to arms, and he named to
 them warriors long dead as well as the living, for the cloud of the curse still
 lingered in his brain.</p>
 
 <p>
 With the curse now departed from them the men
 of Ulster flocked joyfully to the summons, and on every hand there was grinding
 of spears and swords, and buckling on of armour and harnessing of war-chariots
 for the rising-out of the province. ["Rising-out" is the vivid
 expression wed by Irish writers for a clan or territory going on the war-path.
 "Hosting" is also used in a similar sense.] One host came under Conor
 the King and Keltchar, son of Uthecar Hornskin, from Emania southwards, and
 another from the west along the very track of the host of Maev. And Conor's host
 fell upon eight score of</p>
 
 <p>
 [222]</p>
 
 <p>
 the men of Erin in Meath, who were carrying
 away a great booty of women-captives, and they slew every man of the eight score
 and rescued the women. Maev and her host then fell<i> </i>back toward Connacht,
 but when they reached Slemon Midi, the Hill of Slane, in Meath, the Ulster bands
 joined each other there and prepared to give battle. Maev sent her messenger mac
 Roth to view the Ulster host on the Plain of Garach and report upon it. Mac Roth
 came back with an awe-striking description of what he beheld. When he first
 looked he saw the plain covered with deer and other wild beasts. These, explains
 Fergus, had been driven out of the forests by the advancing host of the Ulster
 men. The second time mac Roth looked he saw a mist that filled the valleys, the
 hill-tops standing above it like islands. Out of the mist there came thunder and
 flashes of light, and a wind that nearly threw him off his feet. "What is
 this ?" asks Maev, and Fergus tells her that the mist is the deep breathing
 of the warriors as they march, and the light is the flashing of their eyes, and
 the thunder is the clangour of their war-cars and the dash of their weapons as
 they go to the fight "They think they will never reach it," says
 Fergus. "We have warriors to meet them," says Maev. "You will
 need that," says Fergus, "for in all Ireland, nay, in all the Western
 world, to Greece and Scythia and the Tower of Bregon [see p. 130] and the Island
 of Gades, there live not who can face the men of Ulster in their wrath."</p>

 The battle was joined on the Plain of Garach,
 in Meath. Fergus, wielding a two-handed sword, the</p>
 
 <p>
 [223]</p>
 
 <p>
 sword which, it was said, when swung in
 battle made circles like the arch of a rainbow, swept down whole ranks of the
 Ulster men at each blow, [the sword of Fergus was a fairy weapon called the <i>Caladcholg
 </i>(hard dinter), a name of which Arthur's more famous "Excalibur" is
 a Latinised corruption] and the fierce Maev charged thrice into the heart of the
 enemy.</p>
 
 <p>
 Fergus met Conor the King, and smote him on
 his golden-bordered shield, but Cormac, the king's son, begged for his father's
 life. Fergus then turned on Con all of the Victories.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Too hot art thou," said Conall,
 "against thy people and thy race for a wanton." [the reference is to
 Deirdre] Fergus then turned from slaying the Ulstermen, but in his battle-fury
 he smote among the hills with his rainbow-sword, and struck off the tops of the
 three <i>Maela </i>of Meath, so that they are flat-topped <i>(mael) </i>to this
 day.</p>
 
 <p>
 Cuchulain in his stupor heard the crash of
 Fergus's blows, and coming slowly to himself he asked of Laeg what it meant.
 "It is the sword-play of Fergus," said Laeg. Then he sprang up, and
 his body dilated so that the wrappings and swathings that had been bound on him
 flew off, and he armed himself and rushed into the battle. Here he met Fergus.
 "Turn hither, Fergus," he shouted; "I will wash thee as foam in a
 pool, I will go over thee as the tail goes over a cat, I will smite thee as a
 mother smites her infant." "Who speaks thus to me ?" cried
 Fergus. "Cuchulain mac Sualtam; and now do thou avoid me as thou art
 pledged." [see p. 211]</p>
 
 <p>
 "I have promised even that," said
 Fergus, and then went out of the battle, and with him the men of Leinster and
 the men of Munster, leaving Maev with her seven sons and the hosting of Connacht
 alone.</p>
 
 <p>

 <p>
 It was midday when Cuchulain came into the
 fight; when the evening sun was shining through the leaves of the trees his
 war-chariot was but two wheels and a handful of shattered ribs, and the host of
 Connacht was in full flight towards the border. Cuchulain overtook Maev, who
 crouched under her chariot and entreated grace. "I am not wont to slay
 women," said Cuchulain, and he protected her till she had crossed the
 Shannon at Athlone.</p>

 The Fight of the<i> </i>Bulls</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But the Brown Bull of Quelgny, that Macv had
 sent into Connacht by a circuitous way, met the white-horned Bull of Ailell on
 the Plain of Aei, and the two beasts fought ; but the Brown Bull quickly slew
 the other, and tossed his fragments about the land so that pieces of him were
 strewn from Rathcroghan to Tara; and then careered madly about till he fell
 dead, bellowing and vomiting black gore, at the Ridge of the Bull, between
 Ulster and Iveagh. Ailell and Maev made peace with Ulster for seven years, and
 the Ulster men returned home to Emain Macha with great glory.</p>
 
 <p>
 Thus ends the "Tain Bo Cuailgnè,"
 or Cattle Raid of Quelgny; and it was written out in the "Book of
 Leinster" in the year 1150 by the hand of Finn mac Gorman, Bishop of
 Kildare, and at the end is written "A blessing on all such as faithfully
 shall recite the "Tain" as it stands here, and shall not give it in
 any other form.</p>

 <br>
 
 Cuchulain in Fairyland</p>
 
 
 <p>
 One of the strangest tales in Celtic legend
 tells how Cuchulain, as he lay asleep after hunting, against a pillar-stone, had
 a vision of two Danaan women who came to him armed with rods and alternately
 beat</p>
 
 <p>
 [225]</p>
 
 <p>
 him till he was all but dead, and he could
 not lift a hand to defend himself. Next day, and for a year thereafter, he lay
 in sore sickness, and none could heal him.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then a man whom none knew came and told him
 to go to the pillar-stone where he had seen the vision, and he would learn what
 was to be done for his recovery. There he found a Danaan woman in a green
 mantle, one of those who had chastised him, and she told him that Fand, the
 Pearl of Beauty, wife of Mananan the Sea-god, had set her love on him; and she
 was at enmity with her husband Mananan; and her realm was besieged by three
 demon kings, against whom Cuchulain's help was sought, and the price of his help
 would be the love of Fand. Laeg, the charioteer, was then sent by Cuchulain to
 report upon Fand and her message. He entered Fairyland, which lies beyond a lake
 across which he passed in a magic boat of bronze, and came home with a report of
 Fand's surpassing beauty and the wonders of the kingdom; and Cuchulain then
 betook himself thither. Here he had a battle in a dense mist with the demons,
 who are described as resembling sea-waves - no doubt we are to understand that
 they are the folk of the angry husband, Mananan. Then he abode with Fand,
 enjoying all the delights of Fairyland for a month, after which he bade her
 farewell, and appointed a trysting-place on earth, the Strand of the Yew Tree,
 where she was to meet him.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Fand, Emer, and Cuchulain</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But Emer heard of the tryst; and though not
 commonly disturbed at Cuchulain's numerous infidelities, she came on this
 occasion with fifty of her maidens armed with sharp knives to slay Fand.
 Cuchulain and Fand perceive their chariots from afar, and</p>
 
 <p>
 [226]</p>
 
 <p>
 the armed angry women with golden clasps
 shining on their breasts, and he prepares to protect his mistress. He addresses
 Emer in a curious poem, describing the beauty and skill and magical powers of
 Fand- " There is nothing the spirit can wish for that she has not
 got." Emer replies : "In good sooth, the lady to whom thou dost cling
 seems in no way better than I am, but the new is ever sweet and the well-known
 is sour ; thou hast all the wisdom of the time, Cuchulain Once we dwelled in
 honour together, and still might dwell if I could find favour in thy
 sight." "By my word thou dost," said Cuchulain, "and shalt
 find it so long as I live."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Give me up," then said Fand. But
 Emer said: "Nay, it is more fitting that I be the deserted one. "Not
 so," said Fand; "it is I who must go. "And an eagerness for
 lamentation seized upon Fand, and her soul was great within her, for it was
 shame for her to be deserted and straightway to return to her home; moreover,
 the mighty love that she bore to Cuchulain was tumultuous in her." [S A. H.
 Leahy's translation, " Heroic Romances of Ireland," vol.1.]</p>
 
 <p>
 But Mananan, the Son of the Sea, knew of her
 sorrow and her shame, and he came to her aid, none seeing him but she alone, and
 she welcomed him in a mystic song. "Wilt thou return to me ?" said
 Mananan, "or abide with Cuchulain ?" "In truth," said Fand,
 "neither of ye is better or nobler than the other, but I will go with thee,
 Mananan, for thou hast no other mate worthy of thee, but that Cuchulain has in
 Emer."</p>
 
 <p>
 So she went to Mananan, and Cuchulain, who
 did not see the god, asked Laeg what was happening. "Fand," he
 replied, " is going away with the Son of the Sea, since she hath not been
 pleasing in thy sight."</p>
 
 <p>
 [227]</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Cuchulain bounded into the air and fled
 from the place, and lay a long time refusing meat and drink, until at last the
 Druids gave him a draught of forgetfulness; and Mananan, it is said, shook his
 cloak between Cuchulain and Fand, so that they might meet no more throughout
 eternity. [the cloak of Mananan (see p. 125) typifies the sea - here, in its
 dividing and estranging power.]</p>

 The Vengeance of Maev</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Though Maev made peace with Ulster after the
 battle of Garech she vowed the death of Cuchulain for all the shame and loss he
 had brought upon her and on her province, and she sought how she might take her
 vengeance upon him.</p>
 
 <p>
 Now the wife of the wizard Calatin, whom
 Cuchulain slew at the Ford, brought forth, after her husband's death, six
 children at a birth, namely, three sons and three daughters. Misshapen, hideous,
 poisonous, born for evil were they; and Maev, hearing of these, sent them to
 learn the arts of magic, not in Ireland only, but in Alba; and even as far as
 Babylon they went to seek for hidden knowledge, and they came back mighty in
 their craft, and she loosed them against Cuchulain.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Cuchulain and Blanid</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Besides the Clan Calatin, Cuchulain had also
 other foes, namely Erc, the King of Ireland, son to Cairpre, whom Cuchulain had
 slain in battle, and Lewy son of Curoi, King of Munster.[this Curoi appears in
 various tales of the Ultonian Cycle with attributes which show that he was no
 mortal king, but a local deity.] For Curoi's wife, Blanid, had set her love on
 Cuchulain, and she bade him come and take her from Curoi's dūn, and watch
 his time to</p>
 
 <p>
 [228]</p>
 
 <p>
 attack the dūn when he would see the
 stream that flowed from it turn white. So Cuchulain and his men waited in a wood
 hard by till Blanid judged that the time was fit, and she then poured into the
 stream the milk of three cows. Then Cuchulain attacked the dūn, and took it
 by surprise, and slew Curoi, and bore away the woman. But Fercartna, the bard of
 Curoi, went with them and showed no sign, till, finding him-self near Blanid as
 she stood near the cliff-edge of Bear; he flung his arms round her, and leaped
 with her over the cliff, and so they perished, and Curoi was avenged upon his
 wife.</p>
 
 <p>
 All these now did Maev by secret messages and
 by taunts and exhortations arouse against Cuchulain, and they waited till they
 heard that the curse of Macha was again heavy on the men of UIster, and then
 they assembled a host and marched to the Plain of Murthemney.</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 The Madness of Cuchulain</p>
 
 
 <p>
 And first the Children of Calatin caused a
 horror and a despondency to fall upon the mind of Cuchulain, and out of the
 hooded thistles and puff-balls and fluttering leaves of the forest they made the
 semblance of armed battalions marching against Murthemney, and Cuchulain seemed
 to see on every side the smoke of burning dwellings going up. And for two days
 he did battle with the phantoms till he was sick and wearied out. Then Cathbad
 and the men of Ulster persuaded him to retire to a solitary glen, where fifty of
 the princesses of Ulster, and among them Niam, wife of his faithful friend
 Conall of the Victories, tended him, and Niam made him vow that he would not
 leave the dūn where he was until she gave him leave.</p>
 
 <p>
 But still the Children of Calatin filled the
 land with apparitions of war, and smoke and flames went up, and</p>
 
 <p>
 [229]</p>
 
 <p>
 wild cries and wailings with chattering,
 goblin laughter and the braying of trumpets and horns were borne upon the winds.
 And Bave, Calatin's daughter, went into the glen, and, taking the form of a
 handmaid of Niam, she beckoned her away and led her to a distance among the
 woods and put a spell of straying on her so that she was lost and could find her
 way home no more. Bave then went in the form of Niam to Cuchulain and bade him
 up and rescue Ulster from the hosts that were harrying it, and the Morrigan came
 in the form of a great crow where Cuchulain sat with the women, and croaked of
 war and slaughter. Then Cuchulain sprang up and called Laeg to harness his
 chariot. But when Laeg sought for the Grey of Macha to harness him, the horse
 fled from him, and resisted, and only with great difficulty could Laeg yoke him
 in the chariot, while large tears of dark blood trickled down his face.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Cuchulain, having armed himself, drove
 forth; and on every side shapes and sounds of dread assailed him and clouded his
 mind, and then it appeared to him that he saw a great smoke, lit with bursts of
 red flame, over the ramparts of Emain Macha, and he thought he saw the corpse of
 Emer tossed out over the ramparts. But when he came to his dūn at
 Murthemney, there was Emer living, and she entreated him to leave the phantoms
 alone, but he would not listen to her, and he bade her farewell. Then he bade
 farewell to his mother Dectera, and she gave him a goblet of wine to drink, but
 ere he could drink it the wine turned to blood, and he flung it away, saying,
 "My life's end is near; this time I shall not return alive from the
 battle." And Dectera and Cathbad besought him to await the coming of Conall
 of the Victories, who was away on a journey, but he would not.</p>

 The Washer at the Ford</p>
 
 
 <p>
 When he came to the ford upon the plain of
 Emania he saw there kneeling by the stream as it were a young maiden, weeping
 and wailing, and she washed a heap of bloody raiment and warlike arms in the
 stream, and when she raised a dripping vest or corselet from the water Cuchulain
 saw that they were his own. And as they crossed the ford she vanished from their
 sight. [this apparition of the Washer of the Ford is of frequent occurrence In
 Irish legend.]</p>

 <p>
  <b>Clan
 Calatin Again</b></p>
 
 
 <p>
 Then, having taken his leave of Conor and of
 the womenfolk in Emania, he turned again towards Murthemney and the foe. But on
 his way he saw by the roadside three old crones, each blind of one eye, hideous
 and wretched, and they had made a little fire of sticks, and over it they were
 roasting a dead dog on spits of rowan wood. As Cuchulain passed they called to
 him to alight and stay with them and share their food. "That will I not, in
 sooth," said he. "Had we a great feast," they said, "thou
 wouldst soon have stayed; it doth not become the great to despise the
 small." Then Cuchulain, because he would not be thought discourteous to the
 wretched, lighted down, and he took a piece of the roast and ate it, and the
 hand with which he took it was stricken up to the shoulder so that its former
 strength was gone. For it was <i>geis</i> to Cuchulain to approach a cooking
 hearth and take food from it, and it was <i>geis </i>to him to eat of his
 namesake. [see p. 164 for the reference to <i>geis</i>. " His namesake '
 refers, of course, to the story of the Hound of Cullan, pp. 183, 184.]</p>
 
 <p>
 [231]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Death of Cuchulain</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Near to Slieve Fuad, south of Armagh,
 Cuchulain found the host of his enemies, and drove furiously against them,
 plying the champion's "thunder-feat" upon them until the plain was
 strewn with their dead. Then a satirist, urged on by Lewy, came near him and
 demanded his spear. [It was a point of honour to refuse nothing to a bard; one
 king is said to have given his eye when it was demanded of him.] "Have it'
 then," said Cuchulain, and flung it at him with such force that it went
 clean through him and killed nine men beyond. "A king will fall by that
 spear," said the Children of Calatin to Lewy, and Lewy seized it and flung
 it at Cuchulain, but it smote Laeg, the king of charioteers, so that his bowels
 fell out on the cushions of the chariot, and he bade farewell to his master and
 he died.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then another satirist demanded the spear, and
 Cuchulain said: "I am not bound to grant more than one request on one
 day." But the satirist said "Then I will revile Ulster for thy
 default," and Cuchulain flung him the spear as before, and Erc now got it,
 and this time in flying back it struck the Grey of Macha with a mortal wound.
 Cuchulain drew out the spear from the horse's side, and they bade each other
 farewell, and the Grey galloped away with half the yoke hanging to its neck.</p>
 
 <p>
 And a third time Cuchulain flung the spear to
 a satirist, and Lewy took it again and flung it back, and it struck Cuchulain,
 and his bowels fell out in the chariot, and the remaining horse, Black
 Sainglend, broke away and left him.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I would fain go as far as to that
 loch-side to drink," said Cuchulain, knowing the end was come, and they
 suffered him to go when he had promised to return to them again. So he gathered
 up his bowels into his</p>
 
 <p>
 [252]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 breast and went to the loch-side, and drank,
 and bathed himself, and came forth again to die. Now there was close by a tall
 pillar-stone that stood westwards of the loch, and he went up to it and slung
 his girdle over it and round his breast, so that he might die in his standing
 and not in his lying down; and his blood ran down in a little stream into the
 loch, and an otter came out of the loch and lapped it. And the host gathered
 round, but feared to approach him while the life was still in him, and the
 hero-light shone above his brow. Then came the Grey of Macha to protect him,
 scattering his foes with biting and kicking.</p>
 
 <p>
 And then came a crow and settled on his
 shoulder.</p>
 
 <p>
 Lewy, when he saw this, drew near and pulled
 the hair of Cuchulain to one side over his shoulder, and with his sword he smote
 off his head ; and the sword fell from Cuchulain's hand, and smote off the hand
 of Lewy as it fell. They took the hand of Cuchulain in revenge for this, and
 bore the head and hand south to Tara, and there buried them, and over them they
 raised a mound. But Conall of the Victories, hastening to Cuchulain's side on
 the news of the war, met the Grey of Macha streaming with blood, and together
 they went to the loch-side and saw him headless and bound to the pillar-stone,
 and the horse came and laid its head on his breast. Conall drove southwards to
 avenge Cuchulain, and he came on Lewy by the river Liffey, and because Lewy had
 but one hand Conall tied one of his behind his back, and for half the day they
 fought, but neither could prevail. Then came Conall's horse, the Dewy-Red, and
 tore a piece out of Lewy's side, and Conall slew him, and took his head, and
 returned to Emain Macha. But they made no show of triumph in entering the city,
 for Cuchulain the Hound of Ulster was no more.</p>

 The Recovery of the Tain</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The history of the "Tain," or
 Cattle Raid, of Quelgny was traditionally supposed to have been written by no
 other than Fergus mac Roy, but for a long time the great lay or saga was lost.
 It was believed to have been written out in Ogham characters on staves of wood,
 which a bard who possessed them had taken with him into Italy, whence they never
 returned.</p>
 
 <p>
 The recovery of the "Tain" was the
 subject of a number of legends which Sir S. Ferguson, in his "Lays of the
 Western Gael," has combined in a poem of so much power, <i>so </i>much
 insight into the spirit of Gaelic myth, that I venture to reproduce much of it
 here in telling this singular and beautiful story. It is said that after the
 loss of the loss of the "Tain" Sanchan Torpest, chief bard of Ireland,
 was once taunted at a feast by the High King Guary on his inability to recite
 the most famous and splendid of Gaelic poems. This touched the bard to the
 quick, and he resolved to recover the lost treasure. Far and wide through Erin
 and through Alba he searched for<i> </i>traces of the lay, but could only
 recover scattered fragments. He would have conjured up by magic arts the spirit
 of Fergus to teach it to him, even at the cost of his own life - for such, it
 seems, would have been the price demanded for the intervention and help of the
 dead - but the place of Fergus's grave, where the spells must be said, could not
 be discovered. At last Sanchan sent his son Murgen with his younger brother
 Eimena to journey to Italy and endeavour to discover there the fate of the
 staff-book. The brothers set off on their journey.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Eastward, breadthwise over Erin
 straightway travell'd forth the twain,<br>
 
 Till with many days' wayfaring Murgen fainted by Loch Ein :</p>
 
 <p>
 [234]</p>
 
 <p>
 'Dear my brother, thou art weary : I for
 present aid am flown :<br>
 
 Thou for my returning tarry here beside this Standing Stone.'</p>
 
 <p>
 "Shone the sunset red and solemn:
 Murgen, where he leant, observed<br>
 
 Down the corners of the column letter-strokes of Ogham carved.<br>
 
 ' 'Tis, belike, a burial pillar,' said he, ' and these shallow lines<br>
 
 Hold some warrior's name of valour, could I rightly spell the signs.'</p>
 
 <p>
 "Letter then by letter tracing, soft he
 breathed the sound of each<br>
 
 Sound and sound then interlacing, lo, the signs took form of speech;<br>
 
 And with joy and wonder mainly thrilling, part a-thrill with fear,<br>
 
 Murgen read the legend plainly, 'FERGUS SON OF ROY IS HERE.' "</p>
 
 <p>
 Murgen then, though he knew the penalty,
 appealed to Fergus to pity a son's distress, and vowed, for the sake of the
 recovery of the "Tain," to give his life, and abandon his kin and
 friends and the maiden he loves, so that his father might no more be shamed. But
 Fergus gave no sign, and Murgen tried another plea:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Still he stirs not. Love of women thou
 regard'st not, Fergus, now :<br>
 
 Love of children, instincts human, care for these no more hast thou :<br>
 
 Wider comprehension, deeper insights to the dead belong :-<br>
 
 Since for Love thou wak'st not, Sleeper, yet awake for sake of Song.</p>
 
 <p>
 " 'Thou, the first in rhythmic cadence
 dressing life's discordant tale,<br>
 
 Wars of chiefs and loves of maidens, gavest the Poem to the Gael;<br>
 
 Now they've lost their noblest measure, and in dark days hard at hand,<br>
 
 Song shall be the only treasure left them in their native land.'</p>
 
 <p>
 "Fergus rose. A mist ascended with him,
 and a flash was seen<br>
 
 As of brazen sandals blended with a mantle's wafture green;<br>
 
 But so thick the cloud closed o'er him Eimena, return'd at last,<br>
 
 Found not on the field before him but a mist-heap grey and vast.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Thrice to pierce the hoar recesses
 faithful Eimena essay'd;<br>
 
 Thrice through foggy wildernesses back to open air he stray'd;<br>
 
 Till a deep voice through the vapours fill'd the twilight far and near<br>
 
 And the Night her starry tapers kindling, stoop'd from heaven to hear.</p>
 
 <p>
 [235]</p>
 
 <p>
 "Seem'd as though the skiey Shepherd
 back to earth had cast the fleece<br>
 
 Envying gods of old caught upward from the darkening shrines of Greece;<br>
 
 So the white mists curl'd and glisten'd, so from heaven's expanses bare,<br>
 
 Stars enlarging lean'd and listen'd down the emptied depths of air.</p>
 
 <p>
 "All night long by mists surrounded
 Murgen lay in vapoury bars;<br>
 
 All night long the deep yoice sounded 'neath the keen, enlarging stars :<br>
 
 But when, on the orient verges, stars grew dim and mists retired,<br>
 
 Rising by the stone of Fergus, Murgen stood a man inspired.</p>
 
 <p>
 Back to Sanchan ! -Father, hasten, ere the
 hour of power be past,<br>
 
 Ask not how obtain'd but listen to the lost lay found at last !'<br>
 
 Yea, these words have tramp of heroes in them; and the marching rhyme<br>
 
 Rolls the voices of the eras down the echoing steeps of Time.'</p>
 
 <p>
 "Not till all was thrice related, thrice
 recital full essay'd,<br>
 
 Sad and shamefaced, worn and faded, Murgen sought the faithful maid.<br>
 
 'Ah, so haggard; ah, so altered; thou in life and love so strong !'<br>
 
 'Dearly purchased,' Murgen falter'd, 'life and love I've sold for song !'</p>
 
 <p>
 "'Woe is me, the losing bargain ! what
 can song the dead avail ?'<br>
 
 'Fame immortal,' murmur'd Murgen, 'long as lay delights the Gael.'<br>
 
 'Fame, alas ! the price thou chargest not repays one virgin tear.'<br>
 
 'Yet the proud revenge I've purchased for my sire, I deem not dear.'</p>
 
 <p>
 "So, again to Gort the splendid, when
 the drinking boards were spread,<br>
 
 Sanchan, as of old attended, came and sat at table-head.<br>
 
 'Bear the cup to Sanchan Torpost : twin gold goblets, Bard, are thine,<br>
 
 If with voice and string thou harpest, <i>Tain--Bo-Cuailgine, </i>line for
 line.'</p>
 
 <p>
 " 'Yea, with voice and string I'll chant
 it.' Murgen to his father's knee<br>
 
 Set the harp: no prelude wanted, Sanchan struck the master key,<br>
 
 And, as bursts the brimful river all at once from caves of Cong,<br>
 
 Forth at once, and once for ever, leap'd the torrent of the song.</p>

 The Phantom Chariot of Cuchulain</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Cuchulain, however, makes an impressive
 reappearance in a much later legend of Christian origin, found in the
 twelfth-century "Book of the Dun Cow." He was summoned from Hell, we
 are told, by St. Patrick to prove</p>
 
 <p>
 [238]</p>
 
 <p>
 the truths of Christianity and the horrors of
 damnation to the pagan monarch, Laery mac Neill, King of Ireland. Laery, with
 St. Benen, a companion of Patrick, are standing on the Plain of mac Indoc when a
 blast of icy wind nearly takes them off their feet. It is the wind of Hell,
 Benen explains, after its opening before Cuchulain. Then a dense mist covers the
 plain, and anon a huge phantom chariot with galloping horses, a grey and a
 black, loom up through the mist. Within it are the famous two, Cuchulain and his
 charioteer, giant figures, armed with all the splendour of the Gaelic warrior.</p>
 
 <p>
 Cuchulain then talks to Laery, and urges him
 to "believe in God and in holy Patrick, for it is not a demon that has come
 to thee, but Cuchulain son of Sualtam." To prove his identity he recounts
 his famous deeds of arms, and ends by a piteous description of his present
 state:</p>
 
 <p>
 "What I suffered of trouble,<br>
 
 O Laery, by sea and land -<br>
 
 Yet more severe was a single night<br>
 
 When the demon was wrathful !<br>
 
 Great as was my heroism,<br>
 
 Hard as was my sword,<br>
 
 The devil crushed me with one finger<br>
 
 Into the red charcoal ! "</p>
 
 <p>
 He ends by beseeching Patrick that heaven may
 be granted to him, and the legend tells that the prayer was granted and that
 Laery believed.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Death of Conor mac Nessa</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Christian ideas have also gathered round the
 end of Cuchulain's lord, King Conor of Ulster. The manner of his death was as
 follows: An unjust and cruel attack had been made by him on Mesgedra, King of
 Leinster,</p>
 
 <p>
 [239]</p>
 
 <p>
 in which that monarch met his death at the
 hand of Conall of the Victories. [the story is told in full in the author's
 " High Deeds of Finn."] Conall took out the brains of the dead king
 and mingled them with lime to make a<i> </i>sling-stone-such "brain
 balls," as they were called, being accounted the most deadly of missiles.
 This ball was laid up in the king's treasure-house at Emain Macha, where the
 Connacht champion, Ket son of Maga, found it one day when prowling in disguise
 through Ulster. Ket took it away and kept it always by him. Not long thereafter
 the Connacht men took a spoil of cattle from Ulster, and the Ulster men) under
 Conor, overtook them at a river-ford still called Athnurchar (The Ford of the
 Sling-cast), in Westmeath. A battle was imminent, and many of the ladies of
 Connacht came to their side of the river to view the famous Ultonian warriors,
 and especially Conor, the stateliest man of his time. Conor was willing to show
 himself, and seeing none hut women on the other bank he drew near them; but Ket,
 who was lurking in ambush, now rose and slung the brain-ball at Conor, striking
 him full in the forehead. Conor fell, and was carried off by his routed
 followers. When they got him home, still living, to Emain Macha, his physician,
 Fingen, pronounced that if the ball were extracted from his head he must die; it
 was accordingly sewn up with golden thread, and the king was bidden to keep
 himself from horse-riding and from all vehement passion and exertion, and he
 would do well.</p>
 
 <p>
 Seven years afterwards Conor saw the sun
 darken at noonday, and he summoned his Druid to tell him the cause of the
 portent. The Druid, in a magic trance, tells him of a hill in a distant land on
 which stand three crosses with a human form nailed to each of them, and one of
 them is like the Immortals. "Is he a</p>
 
 <p>
 [240]</p>
 
 <p>
 malefactor ?" then asks Conor. "
 Nay," says the Druid, but the Son of the living God," and he relates
 to the king the story of the death of Christ. Conor breaks out in fury, and
 drawing his sword he hacks at the oak-trees in the sacred grove, crying,
 "Thus would I deal with his enemies," when with the excitement and
 exertion the brain-ball bursts from his head, and he falls dead. And thus was
 the vengeance of Mesgedra fulfilled. With Conor and with Cuchulain the glory of
 the Red Branch and the dominance of Ulster passed away. The next, or Ossianic,
 cycle of Irish legend brings upon the scene different characters, different
 physical surroundings, and altogether different ideals of life.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Ket and the Boar of mac Datho</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The Connacht champion Ket, whose main exploit
 was the wounding of King Conor at Ardnurchar, figures also in a very dramatic
 tale entitled "The Carving of mac Datho's Boar." The story runs as
 follows :</p>
 
 <p>
 Once upon a time there dwelt in the province
 of Leinster a wealthy hospitable lord named Mesroda, son of Datho. Two
 possessions had he ; namely, a hound which could outrun every other hound and
 every wild beast in Erin, and a boar which was the finest and greatest in size
 that man had ever beheld.</p>
 
 <p>
 Now the fame of this hound was noised all
 about the land, and many were the princes and lords who longed to possess it.
 And it came to pass that Conor King of Ulster and Maev Queen of Connacht sent
 messengers to mac Datho to ask him to sell them the hound for a price, and both
 the messengers arrived at the dun of mac Datho on the same day. Said the
 Connacht messenger:</p>
 
 <p>
 "We will give thee in exchange for the
 hound six hundred milch cows, and a chariot with two horses, the best that are
 to be found in Connacht, and at the end</p>
 
 <p>
 [241]</p>
 
 <p>
 of a year thou shalt have as much
 again." And the messenger of King Conor said: "We will give no less
 than Connacht, and the friendship and alliance of Ulster, and that will be
 better for thee than the friendship of Connacht."</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Mesroda mac Datho fell<i> </i>silent,
 and for three days he would not eat or drink, nor could he sleep o' nights, but
 tossed restlessly on his bed. His wife observed his condition, and said to him:
 "Thy fast hath been long, Mesroda, though good food is by thee in plenty;
 and at night thou turnest thy face to the wall, and well I know thou dost not
 sleep. What is the cause of thy trouble?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "There is a saying," replied Mac
 Datho, "'Trust not a thrall with money, nor a woman with a secret.' "</p>
 
 <p>
 "When should a man talk to a
 woman," said his wife, "but when something were amiss? What thy mind
 cannot solve perchance another's may."</p>
 
 <p>
 Then mac Datho told his wife of the request
 for his hound both from Ulster and from Connacht at one and the same time.
 "And whichever of them I deny," he said, "they will harry my
 cattle and slay my people."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Then hear my counsel," said the
 woman. "Give it<i> </i>to both of them, and bid them come and fetch it; and
 if there be any harrying to be done, let them even harry each other; but in no
 way mayest thou keep the hound."</p>
 
 <p>
 Mac Datho followed this wise counsel, and
 bade both Ulster and Connacht to a great feast on the same day, saying to each
 of them that they could have the hound."</p>
 
 <p>
 So on the appointed day Conor of Ulster, and
 Maev, and their retinues of princes and mighty men assembled at the dūn of
 mac Datho. There they found a great feast set forth, and to provide the chief
 dish mac Datho</p>
 
 <p>
 [242]</p>
 
 <p>
 had killed his famous boar, a beast of
 enormous size. The question now arose as to who should have the honourable task
 of carving it, and Bricriu of the Poisoned Tongue characteristically, for the
 sake of the strife which he loved, suggested that the warriors of Ulster and
 Connacht should compare their principal deeds of arms, and give the carving of
 the boar to him who seemed to have done best in the border-fighting which was
 always going on between the provinces. After much bandying of words and of
 taunts Ket son of Maga arises and stands over the boar, knife in hand,
 challenging each of the Ulster lords to match his deeds of valour. One after
 another they arise, Cuscrid son of Conor, Keitchar, Moonremur, Laery the
 Triumphant, and others - Cuchulain is not introduced in this story - and in each
 case Ket has some biting tale to tell of an encounter in which he has come off
 better than they, and one by one they sit down shamed and silenced. At last a
 shout of welcome is heard at the door of the hall and the Ulster-men grow
 jubilant: Conall of the Victories has appeared on the scene, He strides up to
 the boar, and Ket and he greet each other with chivalrous courtesy:</p>
 
 <p>
 "And now welcome to thee, O Conall, thou
 of the iron heart and fiery blood; keen as the glitter of ice, ever-victorious
 chieftain; hall, mighty son of Finnchoom !" said Ket.</p>
 
 <p>
 And Conall said: "Hall to thee, Ket,
 flower of heroes, lord of chariots, a raging sea in battle ; a strong, majestic
 bull; hail,son of Maga !"</p>
 
 <p>
 "And now," went on Conall,
 "rise up from the boar and give me place."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Why so ?" replied Ket.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Dost thou seek a contest from me
 ?" said Conall.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Verily thou shalt have it. By the gods
 of my nation I swear that since I first took weapons in my hand. I</p>
 
 <p>
 [243]</p>
 
 <p>
 have never passed one day that I did not slay
 a Connacht man, nor one night that I did not make a foray on them, nor have I
 ever slept but I had the head of a Connacht man under my knee."</p>
 
 <p>
 "I confess," then said Ket,
 "that thou art a better man than I, and I yield thee the boar. But if
 Anluan my brother were here, he would match thee deed for deed, and sorrow and
 shame it is that he is not."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Anluan is here," shouted Conall,
 and with that he drew from his girdle the head of Anluan and dashed it in the
 face of Ket.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then all sprang to their feet and a wild
 shouting and tumult arose, and the swords flew out of themselves, and battle
 raged in the hall of mac Datho. Soon the hosts burst out through the doors of
 the dūn and smote and slew each other in the open field., until the
 Connacht host were put to flight. The hound of mac Datho pursued the chariot of
 King Ailell of Connacht till the charioteer smote off its head, and so the cause
 of contention was won by neither party, and mac Datho lost his hound, but saved
 his lands and life.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Death of Ket</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The death of Ket is told in Keating's
 "History of Ireland." Returning from a foray in Ulster, he was
 over-taken by Connall at the place called the Ford of Ket, and they fought long
 and desperately. At last Ket was slain, but Conall of the Victories was in
 little better case, and lay bleeding to death when another Connacht champion
 named Bealcu [pronounced "Bay-al-koo"] found him. "Kill me,"
 said Conall to him, "that it be not said I fell at the hand of <i>one </i>Connacht
 man." But Bealcu said : "I will not slay a man at the point of death,
 but I will bring thee home and heal thee, and when thy strength is come again</p>
 
 <p>
 [244]</p>
 
 <p>
 thou shalt fight with me in single
 combat." Then Beilcu put Conall on a litter and brought him home, and had
 him tended till his wounds were healed.</p>
 
 <p>
 The three sons of Bealcu, however, when they
 saw what the Ulster champion was like in all his might, resolved to assassinate
 him before the combat should take place. By a stratagem Conall contrived that
 they slew their own father instead; and then, taking the heads of the three
 sons, he went back, victoriously as he was wont, to Ulster.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Death of Maev</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The tale of the death of Queen Maev is also
 preserved by Keating. Fergus mac Roy having been slain by Ailell with a cast of
 a spear as he bathed in a lake with Maev, and Ailell having been slain by
 Conall, Macv retired to an island [Inis Clothrann, now known as Quaker's Island.
 The pool no longer exists.] on Loch Ryve, where she was wont to bathe early
 every morning in a pool near to the landing place. Forbay son of Conor mac
 Nessa, having discovered this habit of the queen's, found means one day to go
 unperceived to the pool and to measure the distance from it to the shore of the
 mainland. Then he went back to Emania,where he measured out the distance thus
 obtained, and placing an apple on a pole at one end he shot at it continually
 with a sling until he grew so good <i>a </i>marksman at that distance that he
 never missed his aim. Then one day, watching his opportunity by the shores of
 Loch Ryve, he saw Maev enter the water, and putting a bullet in his sling he
 shot at her with so good an aim that he smote her in the centre of the forehead
 and she fell dead.</p>
 
 <p>
 The great warrior queen had reigned in
 Connacht, it was said, for eighty-eight years. She is a signal example</p>
 
 <p>
 [245]</p>
 
 <p>
 of the kind of women whom the Gaelic bards
 delighted to portray. Gentleness and modesty were by no means their usual
 characteristics, but rather a fierce overflowing life. Women-warriors like
 Skatha and Aifa are frequently met with, and one is reminded of the Gaulish
 women, with their mighty snow-white arms, so dangerous to provoke, of whom
 classical writers tell us. The Gaelic bards, who in so many ways anticipated the
 ideas of chivalric romance, did not do so in setting women in a place apart from
 men. Women were judged and treated like men, neither as drudges nor as
 goddesses, and we know that well into historic times they went with men into
 battle, a practice only ended in the sixth century.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>

 </b><p>
 Fergus mac Leda and the Wee Folk</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Of the stories of the Ultonian Cycle which do
 not centre on the figure of Cuchulain, one of the most interesting is that of
 Fergus mac Leda and the King of the Wee Folk. In this tale Fergus appears as
 King of Ulster, but as he was contemporary with Conor mac Nessa, and in the
 Cattle Raid of Quelgny is represented as following him to war, we must conclude
 that he was really a sub-king, like Cuchulain or Owen of Ferney.</p>
 
 <p>
 The tale opens in Faylinn, or the Land of the
 Wee Folk, a race of elves presenting an amusing parody of human institutions on
 a reduced scale, but endowed (like dwarfish people generally in the literature
 of primitive races) with magical powers. Lubdan, ["Youb´dan"] the
 King of Faylinn, when flushed with wine at a feast, is bragging of the greatness
 of his power and the invincibility of his armed forces - have they not the
 strong man Glower, who with his axe has been known to hew down a thistle at a
 stroke ? But the king's bard,</p>
 
 <p>
 [246]</p>
 
 <p>
 Eisirt<i>, has </i>heard something of a giant
 race oversea in a land called Ulster, one man of whom would annihilate a whole
 battalion of the Wee Folk, and he incautiously allows himself to hint as much to
 the boastful monarch. He is immediately clapped into prison for his audacity,
 and only gets free by promising to go immediately to the land of the mighty men,
 and bring back evidence of the truth of his incredible story.</p>
 
 <p>
 So off he goes ; and one fine day King Fergus
 and his lords find at the gate of their Dūn a tiny little fellow
 magnificently dad in the robes of a royal bard, who demands entrance. He is
 borne in upon the hand of AEda, the king's dwarf and bard, and after charming
 the court by his wise and witty sayings, and receiving a noble largesse, which
 he at once distributes among the poets and other court attendants of Ulster, he
 goes off home, taking with him as a guest the dwarf AEda, before whom the Wee
 Folk fly as a "Fomorian giant," although, as Eisirt explains, the
 average man of Ulster can carry him like a child. lubdan is now convinced, but
 Eisirt puts him under <i>geise, </i>the bond of chivalry which no Irish
 chieftain can repudiate without being shamed, to go himself, as Eisirt has done,
 to the palace of Fergus and taste the king's porridge. lubdan, after he has seen
 AEda, is much dismayed, but he prepares to go, and bids Bebo, his wife,
 accompany him. "You did an ill deed," she says, "when you
 condemned Eisirt to prison; but surely there is no man under the sun that can
 make thee hear reason."</p>
 
 <p>
 So off they go, and lubdan's fairy steed
 bears them over the sea till they reach Ulster, and by midnight they stand
 before the king's palace. "Let us taste the porridge as we were
 bound," says Bebo, "and make off before daybreay" They steal in
 and find the</p>
 
 <p>
 [247]</p>
 
 <p>
 porridge-pot, to the rim of which lubdan can
 only reach by standing. on his horse's back. In straining downwards to get at
 the porridge he overbalances himself and falls in. There in the thick porridge
 he sticks fast, and there Fergus's scullions find him at the break of day, with
 the faithful Bebo lamenting. They bear him off to Fergus, who is amazed at
 finding another wee man, with a woman too, in his palace. He treats them
 hospitably, but refuses all appeals to let them go. The story now recounts in a
 spirit of broad humour several Rabelaisian adventures in which Bebo is
 concerned, and gives a charming poem supposed to have been uttered by lubdan in
 the form of advice to Fergus's fire-gillie as to the merits for burning of
 different kinds of timber. The following arc extracts:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Burn not the sweet apple-tree of
 drooping branches, of the white blossoms, to whose gracious head each man puts
 forth his hand."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Burn not the noble willow, the
 unfailing ornament of poems; bees drink from its blossoms, all delight in the
 graceful tent."</p>
 
 <p>
 "The delicate, airy tree of the Druids,
 the rowan with its berries, this burn ; but avoid the weak tree, burn not the
 slender hazel."</p>
 
 <p>
 "The ash-tree of the black buds burn
 not-timber that speeds the wheel, that yields the rider his switch the ashen
 spear is the scale-beam of battle."</p>
 
 <p>
 At last the Wee Folk come in a great
 multitude to beg the release of lubdan. On the king's refusal they visit the
 country with various plagues, snipping off the ears of corn, letting the calves
 suck all the cows dry, defiling the wells, and so forth ; but Fergus is
 obdurate. In their quality as earth-gods, <i>dei terreni, </i>they promise to
 make the plains before the palace of Fergus stand thick with corn every year
 without ploughing or sowing,</p>
 
 <p>
 [248]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p align="center">
 </p>
 
 <p>
 but all is vain. At last, however, Fergus
 agrees to ransom lubdan against the best of his fairy treasures, so lubdan
 recounts them-the cauldron that can never be emptied, the harp that plays of
 itself; and finally he mentions a pair of water-shoes, wearing which a man can
 go over or under water as freely as on dry land. Fergus accepts the shoes, and
 lubdan is released.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Blemish of Fergus</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But it is hard for a mortal to get the better
 of Fairy-land-a touch of hidden malice lurks in magical gifts, and so it proved
 now. Fergus was never tired of exploring the depths of the lakes and rivers of
 Ireland; but one day, in Loch Rury, he met with a hideous monster, the <i>Muirdris,
 </i>or river-horse, which inhabited that lake, and from which he barely saved
 himself by flying to the shore. With the terror of this encounter his face was
 twisted awry; but since a blemished man could not hold rule in Ireland, his
 queen and nobles took pains, on some pretext, to banish all mirrors from the
 palace, and kept the knowledge of his condition from him. One day, however, he
 smote a bondmaid with a switch, for some negligence, and the maid, indignant,
 cried out : "lt were better for thee, Fergus, to avenge thyself on the
 river-horse that hath twisted thy face than to do brave deeds on women !"
 Fergus bade fetch him a mirror, and looked in it. " It is true," he
 said; "the river-horse of Loch Rury has done this thing."</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Death of Fergus</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The conclusion may be given in the words of
 Sir Samuel Ferguson's fine poem on this theme. Fergus</p>
 
 <p>
 [249]</p>
 
 <p>
 donned the magic shoes, took sword in hand,
 and went to Loch Rury :</p>
 
 <p>
 "For a day and night<br>
 
 Beneath the waves he rested out of sight,<br>
 
 But all the Ultonians on the bank who stood<br>
 
 Saw the loch boil and redden with his blood.<br>
 
 When next at sunrise skies grew also red<br>
 
 He rose - and in his hand the <i>Muirdris' </i>head.<br>
 
 Gone was the blemish ! On his goodly face<br>
 
 Each trait symmetric had resumed its place :<br>
 
 And they who saw him marked in all his mien<br>
 
 A king's composure, ample and serene.<br>
 
 He smiled; he cast his trophy to the bank,<br>
 
 Said, 'I, survivor, Ulstermen !' and sank."</p>
 
 <p>
 This fine tale has been published in full
 from an Egerton MS., by Mr. Standish Hayes O'Grady, in his "Silva
 Gadelica." The humorous treatment of the fairy element in the story would
 mark it as belonging to a late period of Irish legend, but the tragic and noble
 conclusion unmistakably signs it <i>as </i>belonging to the Ulster bardic
 literature, and it falls within the same order<i> </i>of ideas, if it were not
 composed within the same period, as the tales of Cuchulain.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <p>
  <b>Significance
 of Irish Place-Names</b></p>
 
 
 <p>
 Before leaving this great cycle of legendary
 literature let us notice what has already, perhaps, attracted the attention of
 some readers - the extent to which its chief characters and episodes have been
 commemorated in the still surviving place-names of the country. [Dr. P. W.
 Joyce's "Irish Names of Places" is a storehouse of information on this
 subject.] This is true of Irish legend in general - it is especially so of the
 Ultonian Cycle. Faithfully indeed, through many a century of darkness and
 forgetting, have these names pointed to the hidden treasures of heroic romance</p>
 
 <p>
 [250]</p>
 
 <p>
 which the labours of our own day are now
 restoring to light. The name of the little town of Ardee, as we have seen,
 [p.211, <i>note</i>] commemorates the tragic death of Ferdia at the hand of his
 "heart companion," the noblest hero of the Gad. The ruins of Dūn
 Baruch, where Fergus was bidden to the treacherous feast, still look over the
 waters of Moyle, across which Naisi and Deirdre sailed to their doom.
 Ardnurchar, the Hill of the Sling-cast, in Westmeath, [the name is given to the
 hill, <i>ard</i>, and to the ford, <i>atha</i> beneath it.] brings to mind the
 story of the stately monarch, the crowd of gazing women, and the crouching enemy
 with the deadly missile which bore the vengeance of Mesgedra. The name of
 Armagh, or Ard Macha, the Hill of Macha, enshrines the memory of the Fairy Bride
 and her heroic sacrifice, while the grassy rampart can still be traced where the
 war-goddess in the earlier legend drew its outline with the pin of her brooch
 when she founded the royal fortress of Ulster. Many pages might be filled with
 these instances. Perhaps no modern country has place-names so charged with
 legendary associations as are those of Ireland. Poetry and myth are there still
 closely wedded to the very soil of the land-a fact in which there lies ready to
 hand an agency for education, for inspiration, of the noblest kind, if we only
 had the insight to see it and the art to make use of it.</p>
