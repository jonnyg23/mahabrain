 <center><h1>Chapter VI: Tales of the Ossianic Cycle</h1></center>
 <b>
 </b><p>
  </p>
 
   <p>
 The Fianna of Erin</p>
 
 
 <p>
 AS the tales of the Ultonian Cycle duster
 round the heroic figure of the Hound of Cullan, so do those of the Ossianic
 Cycle round that of Finn mac Cumhal, [pronounced "mac Cool"] whose son
 Oisin [pronounced "Usheen"] (or Ossian, as Macpherson called him in
 the pretended translations from the Gaelic which first introduced him to the
 English-speaking world) was a poet as well as a warrior, and is the traditional
 author of most of them. The events of the Ultonian Cycle are supposed to have
 taken place about the time of the birth of Christ. Those of the Ossianic Cycle
 fell mostly in the reign of Cormac mac Art, who lived in the third century A.D.
 During his reign the Fianna of Erin, who are represented as a kind of military
 Order composed mainly of the members of two clans, Clan Bascna and Clan Morna,
 and who were supposed to be devoted to the service of the High King and to the
 repelling of foreign invaders, reached the height of their renown under the
 captaincy of Finn.</p>
 
 <p>
 The annalists of ancient Ireland treated the
 story of Finn and the Fianna, in its main outlines, as sober history. This it
 can hardly be. Ireland had no foreign invaders during the period when the Fianna
 are supposed to have flourished, and the tales do not throw a ray of light on
 the real history of the country; they are far more concerned with a Fairyland
 populated by supernatural beings, beautiful or terrible, than with any tract of
 real earth inhabited by real men and women. The modern critical reader of these
 tales will soon feel that it would be idle to seek for any basis of fact in this
 glittering</p>
 
 <p>
 [252]</p>
 
 <p>
 mirage. But the mirage was created by poets
 and storytellers of such rare gifts for this kind of literature that it took at
 once an extraordinary hold on the imagination of the Irish and Scottish Gael.</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 The Ossianic Cycle</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The earliest tales of this cycle now extant
 are found in manuscripts of the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and were
 composed probably a couple of centuries earlier. But the cycle lasted in a
 condition of vital growth for a thousand years, right down to Michael Comyn's
 "Lay of Oisin in the Land of Youth," which was composed about 1750,
 and which ended the long history of Gaelic literature. [subject, of course, to
 the possibility that the present revival of Gaelic as a spoken tongue may lead
 to the opening of a new chapter in that history.] It has been estimated [see
 "Ossian and Ossianic Literature," by Alfred Nutt, p. 4] that if all
 the tales and poems of the Ossianic Cycle which still remain could be printed
 they would fill some twenty-five volumes the size of this. Moreover, a very
 great proportion of this literature, even if there were no manuscripts at all,
 could during the last and the preceding centuries have been recovered from the
 lips of what has been absurdly called an "illiterate" peasantry in the
 Highlands and in the Gaelic-speaking parts of Ireland. It cannot but interest us
 to study the character of the literature which was capable of exercising such a
 spell.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Contrasted with the Ultonian Cycle</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Let us begin by saying that the reader will
 find himself in an altogether different atmosphere from that in which the heroes
 of the Ultonian Cycle live and move. Everything speaks of a later epoch, when
 life was gentler and softer, when men lived more in settlements and towns,</p>
 
 <p>
 [253]</p>
 
 <p>
 when the Danaan Folk were more distinctly
 fairies and less deities, when in literature the elements of wonder and romance
 predominated, and the iron string of heroism and self-sacrifice was more rarely
 sounded. There is in the Ossianic literature a conscious delight in and romance
 predominated, and the iron string of heroism and self-sacrifice was more rarely
 sounded. There is in the Ossianic literature a conscious delight in wild nature,
 in scenery, in the song of birds, the music of the chase through the woods, in
 mysterious and romantic adventure, which speaks unmistakably of a time when the
 free, open-air life "under the greenwood tree" is looked back on and
 idealised, but no longer habitually lived, by those who celebrate it. There is
 also a significant change of <i>locale. </i>The Conorian tales were the product
 of a literary movement having its sources among the bleak hills or on the stern
 rock-bound coasts of Ulster. In the Ossianic Cycle we find ourselves in the
 Midlands or South of lreland. Much of the action takes place amid the soft
 witchery of the Killarney landscape, and the difference between the two regions
 is reflected in the ethical temper of the tales.</p>
 
 <p>
 In the Ultonian Cycle it will have been
 noticed that however extravagantly the supernatural element may be employed, the
 final significance of almost every tale, the end to which all the supernatural
 machinery is worked, is something real and human, something that has to do with
 the virtues or vices, the passions or the duties or men and women. In the
 Ossianic Cycle, broadly speaking, this is not so. The nobler vein of literature
 seems to have been exhausted, and we have now beauty for the sake of beauty,
 romance for the sake of romance, horror or mystery for the sake of the
 excitement they arouse. The Ossianic tales are, at their best,</p>
 
 <p>
 "Lovely apparitions, sent<br>
 
 To be a moment's ornament."</p>
 
 <p>
 They lack that something, found in the
 noblest art as in</p>
 
 <p>
 [254]</p>
 
 <p>
 the noblest personalities, which has power
 "to warn, to comfort, and command."</p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 <br>
 
 The Coming of Finn</p>
 
 
 <p>
 King Cormac mac Art was certainly a
 historical character, which is more, perhaps, than we can say of Conor mac
 Nessa. Whether there is any real personage behind the glorious figure of his
 great captain, Finn, it is more difficult to say. But for our purpose it is not
 necessary to go into this question. He was a creation of the Celtic mind in one
 land and in one stage of its development, and our part here is to show what kind
 of character the Irish mind liked to idealise and make stories about.</p>
 
 <p>
 Finn, like most of the Irish heroes, had a
 partly Danaan ancestry. His mother, Murna of the White Neck, was grand-daughter
 of Nuada of the Silver Hand, who had wedded that Ethlinn, daughter of Balor the
 Fomorian, who bore the Sun-god Lugh to Kian. Cumhal son of Trenmor was Finn's
 father. He was chief of the Clan Bascna, who were contending with the Clan Morna
 for the leadership of the Fianna, and was overthrown and slain by these at the
 battle of Knock. [now Castleknock, near Dublin]</p>
 
 <p>
 Among the Clan Morna was a man named Lia, the
 lord of Luachar in Connacht, who was Treasurer of the Fianna, and who kept the
 Treasure Bag, a bag made ot crane's skin and having in it magic weapons and
 jewels of great price that had come down from the days of the Danaans. And he
 became Treasurer to the Clan Morna, and still kept the bag at Rath Luachar.</p>
 
 <p>
 Murna, after the defeat and death ot Cumhal,
 took refuge in the forests of Slieve Bloom, [in the King's Country] and there
 she bore a man-child whom she named Demna. For fear</p>
 
 <p>
 [255]</p>
 
 <p>
 that the Clan Morna would find him out and
 slay him, she gave him to be nurtured in the wudwood by two aged women, and she
 herself became wife to the King of Kerry. But Demna, when he grew up to be a
 lad, was called "Finn" or the Fair One, on account of the whiteness of
 his skin and his golden hair, and by this name he was always known thereafter.
 His first deed was to slay Lia, who had the Treasure Bag of the Fianna,. which
 he took from him. He then sought out his uncle Crimmal, who, with a few other
 old men, survivors of the chiefs of Clan Bascna, had escaped the sword at
 Castleknock, and were living in much penury and affliction in the recesses of
 the forests of Connacht. These he furnished with a retinue and guard from among
 a body of youths who followed his fortunes, and gave them the Treasure Bag. He
 himself went to learn the accomplishments of poetry and science from an ancient
 sage and Druid named Finegas, who dwelt on the river Boyne. Here, in a pool of
 this river, under boughs of hazel from which dropped the Nuts of Knowledge on
 the stream, lived Fintan the Salmon of Knowledge, which whoso ate of him would
 enjoy all the wisdom of the ages. Finegas had sought many a time to catch this
 salmon, but failed until Finn had come to be his pupil. Then one day he caught
 it, and gave it to Finn to cook, bidding him eat none of it himself; but to tell
 him when it was ready. When the lad brought the salmon, Finegas saw that his
 countenance was changed. "Hast thou eaten of the salmon?" he asked.
 "Nay," said Finn, "but when I turned it on the spit my thumb was
 burnt, and I put it to my mouth." "Take the Salmon of Knowledge and
 eat it," then said Finegas, "for in thee the prophecy is come true.
 And now go hence, for I can teach thee no more."</p>
 
 <p>
 After that Finn became as wise as he was
 strong and</p>
 
 <p>
 [256]</p>
 
 <p>
 bold, and it is said that whenever he wished
 to divine what would befall, or what was happening at a distance, he had but to
 put his thumb in his mouth and bite it, and the knowledge he wished for would be
 his.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Finn and the Goblin</p>
 
 
 <p>
 At this time Goll son of Morna was the
 captain of the Fianna of Erin, but Finn, being come to man's estate, wished to
 take the place of his father Cumhal. So he went to Tara, and during the Great
 Assembly, when no man might raise his hand against any other in the precincts of
 Tara, he sat down among the king's warriors and the Fianna. At last the king
 marked him as a stranger among them, and bade him declare his name and lineage.
 "I am Finn son of Cumhal," said he, "and I am come to take
 service with thee, O King, as my father did." The king accepted him gladly,
 and Finn swore loyal service to him. No long time after that came the period of
 the year when Tara was troubled by a goblin or demon that came at night-fall and
 blew fire-balls against the royal city, setting it in flames, and none could do
 battle with him, for as he came he played on a harp a music so sweet that each
 man who heard it was lapped in dreams, and forgot all else on earth for the sake
 of listening to that music. When this was told to Finn he went to the king and
 said "Shall I, if I slay the goblin, have my father's place as captain of
 the Fianna?" "Yea, surely," said the king, and he bound himself
 to this by an oath.</p>
 
 <p>
 Now there were among the men-at-arms an old
 follower of Finn's father, Cumhal, who possessed a magic spear with a head of
 bronze and rivets of Arabian gold. The head was kept laced up in a leathern
 case; and it had the property that when the naked blade was laid against the
 forehead of a man it</p>
 
 <p>
 [257]</p>
 
 <p>
 would fill him with a strength and a
 battle-fury that would make him invincible in every combat. This spear the man
 Fiacha gave to Finn, and taught him how to use it, and with it he awaited the
 coming of the goblin on the ramparts of Tara. As night fell and mists began to
 gather in the wide plain around the Hill he saw a shadowy form coming swiftly
 towards him, and heard the notes of the magic harp. But laying the spear to his
 brow he shook off the spell, and the phantom fled before him to the Fairy Mound
 of Slieve Fuad, and there Finn overtook and slew him, and bore back his head to
 Tara.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Cormac the King set Finn before the
 Fianna, and bade them all either swear obedience to him as their captain or seek
 service elsewhere. And first of all Goll mac Morna swore service, and then all
 the rest followed, and Finn became Captain of the Fianna of Erin, and ruled them
 till he died.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Finn's Chief Men: Conan mac Lia</p>
 
 
 <p>
 With the coming of Finn the Fianna of Erin
 came to their glory, and with his life their glory passed away. For he ruled
 them as no other captain ever did, both strongly and wisely, and never bore a
 grudge against any, but freely forgave a man all offences save disloyalty to his
 lord. Thus it is told that Conan, son of the lord of Luachar, him who had the
 Treasure Bag and whom Finn slew at Rath Luachar, was for seven years an outlaw
 and marauder, harrying the Fians and killing here a man and there a hound, and
 firing dwellings, and raiding their cattle. At last they ran him to a corner at
 Carn Lewy, in Munster, and when he saw that he could escape no more he stole
 upon Finn as he sat down after a chase, and flung his arms round him from
 behind, holding him fast and motionless. Finn knew who held</p>
 
 <p>
 [258]</p>
 
 <p>
 him thus, and said: "What wilt thou,
 Conan?" Conan said: "To make a covenant of service and fealty with
 thee, for I may no longer evade thy wrath." So Finn laughed and said:
 "Be it so, Conan, and if thou prove faithful and valiant I also will keep
 faith." Conan served him for thirty years, and no man of all the Fianna was
 keener and hardier in fight.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Conan mac Morna</p>
 
 
 <p>
 There was also another Conan, namely, mac
 Morna, who was big and bald, and unwieldy in manly exercises, but whose tongue
 was bitter and scurrilous; no high or brave thing was done that Conan the Bald
 did not mock and belittle. It Is said that when he was stripped he showed down
 his back and buttocks a black sheep's fleece instead of a man's skin, and this
 is the way it came about. One day when Conan and certain others of the Fianna
 were hunting in the forest they came to a stately dūn, white-walled, with
 coloured thatching on the roof, and they entered it to seek hospitality. But
 when they were within they found no man, but a great empty hall with pillars of
 cedar-wood and silken hangings about it, like the hall of a wealthy lord. In the
 midst there was a table set forth with a sumptuous feast of boar's flesh and
 venison, and a great vat of yew wood full of red wine, and cups of gold and
 silver. So they set themselves gaily to eat and drink, for they were hungry from
 the chase, and talk and laughter were loud around the board. But one of them ere
 long started to his feet with a cry of fear and wonder, and they all looked
 round, and saw before their eyes the tapestried walls changing to rough wooden
 beams, and the ceiling to foul sooty thatch like that of a herdsman's hut. So
 they knew they were being entrapped by some enchantment of the Fairy Folk, and
 all sprang to their</p>
 
 <p>
 [259]</p>
 
 <p>
 feet and made for the doorway, that was no
 longer high and stately, but was shrinking to the size of a fox-earth - all but
 Conan the Bald, who was gluttonously devouring the good things on the table, and
 heeded nothing else. Then they shouted to him, and as the last of them went out
 he strove to rise and follow, but found himself limed to the chair so that he
 could not stir. So two of the Fianna, seeing his plight, rushed back and seized
 his arms and tugged with all their might, and as they dragged him away they left
 the most part of his raiment and his skin sticking to the chair. Then, not
 knowing what else to do with him in his sore plight, they clapped upon his back
 the nearest thing they could find, which was the skin of a black sheep that they
 took from a peasant's flock hard by, and it grew there, and Conan wore it till
 his death.</p>
 
 <p>
 Though Conan was a coward and. rarely
 adventured himself in battle with the Fianna, it is told that once a good man
 fell by his hand. This was on the day of the great battle with the pirate horde
 on the Hill of Slaughter in Kerry. [the hill still bears the name, Knockanar]
 For Liagan, one of the invaders, stood out before the hosts and challenged the
 bravest of the Fians to single combat, and the Fians in mockery thrust Conan
 forth to the fight. When he appeared Liagan laughed, for he had more strength
 than wit, and he said: "Silly is thy visit, thou bald old man." And as
 Conan still approached Liagan lifted his hand fiercely, and Conan said:
 "Truly thou art in more peril from the man behind than from the man in
 front." Liagan looked round; and in that instant Conan swept off his head,
 and then threw his sword and ran for shelter to the ranks of the laughing Fians.
 But Finn was very wroth because he had won the victory by a trick.</p>
 
 <p>

 <p align="center">

 <br>
 
 </p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Dermot O'Dyna</p>
 
 
 <p>
 And one of the chiefest of the friends of
 Finn was Dermot of the Love Spot. He was so fair and noble to look on that no
 woman could refuse him love, and it was said that he never knew weariness, but
 his step was as light at the end of the longest day of battle or the chase as it
 was at the beginning. Between him and Finn there was great love, until the day
 when Finn, then an old man, was to wed Grania, daughter of Cormac the High King
 ; but Grania bound Dermot by the sacred ordinances of the Fian chivalry to fly
 with her on her wedding night, which thing, sorely against his will, he did, and
 thereby got his death. But Grania went back to Finn, and when the Fianna saw her
 they laughed through all the camp in bitter mockery, for they would not have
 given one of the dead man's fingers for twenty such as Grania.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Keelta mac Ronan and Oisin</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Another of the chief men that Finn had was
 Keelta mac Ronan, who was one of his house-stewards, and a strong warrior as
 well as a golden-tongued reciter of tales and poems. And there was Oisin, the
 son of Finn, the greatest poet of the Gael, of whom more shall be told
 hereafter.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Oscar</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Oisin had a son, Oscar, who was the fiercest
 fighter in battle among all the Fians. He slew in his maiden battle three kings,
 and in his fury he also slew by mischance his own friend and condisciple Linné,.
 His wife was the fair Aideen, who died of grief after Oscar's death in the
 battle of Gowra, and Oisin buried her on Ben Edar (Howth), and raised over her
 the great</p>
 
 <p>
 [261]</p>
 
 <p>
 dolmen which is there to this day. Oscar
 appears in this literature as a type of hard strength, with a heart "like
 twisted horn sheathed in steel," a character made as purely for war as a
 sword or spear.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Geena mac Luga</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Another good man that Finn had was Geena, the
 son of Luga; his mother was the warrior-daughter of Finn, and his father was a
 near kinsman of hers. He was nurtured by a woman that bore the name of Fair
 Mane, who had brought up many of the Fianna to manhood. When his time to take
 arms was come he stood before Finn and made his covenant of fealty, and Finn
 gave him the captaincy of a band. But mac Luga proved slothful and selfish, for
 ever vaunting himself and his weapon-skill, and never training his men to the
 chase of deer or boar, and he used to beat his hounds and his serving-men. At
 last the Fians under him came with their whole company to Finn at Loch Lena, in
 Killarney, and there they laid their complaint against mac Luga, and said:
 "Choose now, O Finn, whether you will have us or the son of Luga by
 himself"</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Finn sent to mac Luga and questioned
 him, but mac Luga could say nothing to the point as to why the Fianna would none
 of him. Then Finn taught him the things befitting a youth of noble birth and a
 captain of men, and they were these:</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Maxims of the Fianna</p>
 
 
 <p>
 "Son of Lug; if armed service be thy
 design, in a great man's household be quiet, be surly in the narrow pass.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Without a fault of his beat not thy
 hound; until thou ascertain her guilt, bring not a charge against thy wife.</p>
 
 <p>
 [262]</p>
 
 <p>
 "In battle meddle not with a buffoon,
 for, O mac Luga, he is but a fool.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Censure not any if he be of grave
 repute ; stand not up to take part in a brawl; have naught to do with a madman
 or a wicked one.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Two-thirds of thy gentleness be shown
 to women and to those that creep on the floor (little children) and to poets,
 and be not violent to the common people.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Utter not swaggering speech, nor say
 thou wilt not yield what is right ; it is a shameful thing to speak too stiffly
 unless that it be feasible to carry out thy words.</p>
 
 <p>
 "So long as thou shalt live, thy lord
 forsake not; neither for gold nor for other reward in the world abandon one whom
 thou art pledged to protect.</p>
 
 <p>
 "To a chief do not abuse his people, for
 that is no work for a man of gentle blood.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Be no tale-bearer, nor utterer of
 falsehoods ; be not talkative nor rashly censorious. Stir not up strife against
 thee, however good a man thou be.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Be no frequenter of the drinking-house,
 nor given to carping at the old; meddle not with a man of mean estate.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Dispense thy meat freely; have no
 niggard for thy familiar.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Force not thyself upon a chief, nor
 give him cause to speak ill of thee.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Stick to thy gear; hold fast to thy
 arms till the stern fight with its weapon-glitter be ended.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Be more apt to give than to deny, and
 follow after gentleness, O son of Luga,"</p>
 
 <p>
 And the son of Luga, it is written, heeded
 these counsels, and gave up his bad ways, and he became one of the best of
 Finn's men.</p>
 
 <p>
 [263]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Character of Finn</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Suchlike things also Finn taught to all his
 followers, and the best of them became like himself in valour and gentleness and
 generosity. Each of them loved the repute of his comrades more than his own, and
 each would say that for all noble qualities there was no man in the breadth of
 the world worthy to be thought of beside Finn.</p>
 
 <p>
 It was said of him that "he gave away
 gold as if it were the leaves of the woodland, and silver as if it were the foam
 of the sea"; and that whatever he had bestowed upon any man, if he fell out
 with him afterwards, he was never known to bring it against him.</p>
 
 <p>
 The poet Oisin once sang of him to St.
 Patrick :</p>
 
 <p>
 "These are the things that were dear to
 Finn -<br>
 
 The din of battle, the banquet's glee,<br>
 
 The bay of his hounds through the rough glen ringing,<br>
 
 And the blackbird singing in Letter Lee,</p>
 
 <p>
 "The shingle grinding along the shore<br>
 
 When they dragged his war-boats down to sea,<br>
 
 The dawn wind whistling his spears among,<br>
 
 And the magic song of his minstrels three."</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Tests of the Fianna</p>
 
 
 <p>
 In the time of Finn no one was ever permitted
 to be one of the Fianna of Erin unless he could pass through many severe tests
 of his worthiness. He must be versed in the Twelve Books of Poetry, and must
 himself be skilled to make verse in the rime and metre of the masters of Gaelic
 poesy. Then he was buried to his middle in the earth, and must, with a shield
 and a hazel stick, there defend himself against nine warriors casting spears at
 him, and if he were wounded he was not accepted. Then his hair was woven into
 braid; and he was chased through the forest by the Fiana. If</p>
 
 <p>
 [264]</p>
 
 <p>
 he were overtaken, or if a braid of his hair
 were disturbed, or if a dry stick cracked under his foot, he was not accepted.
 He must be able to leap over a lath level with his brow, and to run at full
 speed under one level with his knee, and he must be able while running to draw
 out a thorn from his foot and never slacken speed. He must take no dowry with a
 wife.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Keelta and St. Patrick</p>
 
 
 <p>
 It was said that one of the Fians, namely,
 Keelta, lived on to a great age, and saw St. Patrick, by whom he was baptized
 into the faith of the Christ, and to whom he told many tales of Finn and his
 men, which Patrick's scribe wrote down. And once Patrick asked him how it was
 that the Fianna became so mighty and so glorious that all Ireland sang of their
 deeds, as Ireland has done ever since. Keelta answered: "Truth was in our
 hearts and strength in our arms, and what we said, that we fulfilled."</p>
 
 <p>
 This was also told of Keelta after he had
 seen St. Patrick and received the Faith. He chanced to be one day by Leyney, in
 Connacht, where the Fairy Folk of the Mound of Duma were wont to be sorely
 harassed and spoiled every year by pirates from oversea. They called Keelta to
 their aid, and by his counsel and valour the invaders were overcome and driven
 home; but Keelta was sorely wounded. Then Keelta asked that Owen, the seer of
 the Fairy Folk, might foretell him how long he had to live, for he was already a
 very aged man. Owen said: "It will be seventeen years, O Keelta of fair
 fame, till thou fall by the pool of Tara, and grievous that will be to all the
 king's household."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Even so did my chief and lord, my
 guardian and loving protector, Finn, foretell to me," said Keelta.
 "And now what fee will ye give me for my rescue</p>
 
 <p>
 [265]</p>
 
 <p>
 of you from the worst affliction that ever
 befell you ?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "A great reward," said the Fairy
 Folk, "even youth; for by our art we shall change you into a young man
 again with all the strength and activity of your prime."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Nay, God forbid," said Keelta,
 "that I should take upon me a shape of sorcery, or any other than that
 which my Maker, the true and glorious God, hath bestowed upon me."</p>
 
 <p>
 And the Fairy Folk said: "It is the word
 of a true warrior and hero, and the thing that thou sayest is good." So
 they healed his wounds, and every bodily evil that he had, and he wished them
 blessing and victory, and went his way.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Birth of Oisin</p>
 
 
 <p>
 One day, as Finn and his companions and dogs
 were returning from the chase to their dūn on the Hill of Allen, a
 beautiful fawn started up on their path, and the chase swept after her, she
 taking the way which led to their home. Soon all the pursuers were left far
 behind save only Finn himself and his two hounds Bran and Skolawn. Now these
 hounds were of strange breed; for Tyren, sister to Murna, the mother of Finn,
 had been changed into a hound by the enchantment of a woman of the Fairy Folk,
 who loved Tyren's husband Ullan; and the two hounds of Finn were the children of
 Tyren, born to her in that shape. Of all hounds in Ireland they were the best,
 and Finn loved them much, so that it was said he wept but twice in his life, and
 once was for the death of Bran.</p>
 
 <p>
 At last, as the chase went on down a
 valley-side, Finn saw the fawn stop and lie down, while the two hounds began to
 play. round her, and to lick her face and limbs. So he gave commandment that
 none should hurt her, and she followed them to the Dūn of Allen, playing
 with the hounds as she went</p>
 
 <p>

 <p>
 The same night Finn awoke and saw standing by
 his bed the fairest woman his eyes had ever beheld.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I am Saba, O Finn," she said,
 "and I was the fawn ye chased to-day. Because I would not give my love to
 the Druid of the Fairy Folk, who is named the Dark, he put that shape upon me by
 his sorceries, and I have borne it these three years. But a slave of his,
 pitying me, once revealed to me that if I could win to thy great Dūn of
 Allen, O Finn, I should be safe from all enchantments, and my natural shape
 would come to me again. But I feared to be torn in pieces by thy dogs, or
 wounded by thy hunters, till at last I let myself be overtaken by thee alone and
 by Bran and Skolawn, who have the nature of man and would do me no hurt."</p>
 
 <p>
 "Have no fear, maiden," said Finn
 "we, the Fianna, are free, and our guest-friends are free; there is none
 who shall put compulsion on you here."</p>
 
 <p>
 So Saba dwelt with Finn, and he made her his
 wife and so deep was his love for her that neither the battle nor the chase had
 any delight for him, and for months he never left her side. She also loved him
 as deeply, and their joy in each other was like that of the Immortals in the
 Land of Youth. But at last word came to Finn that the warships of the Northmen
 were in the Bay of Dublin, and he summoned his heroes to the fight ;
 "For," said he to Saba, "the men of Erin give us tribute and
 hospitality to defend them from the foreigner, and it were shame to take it from
 them and not to give that to which we, on our side, are pledged." And he
 called to mind that great saying of Goll mac Morna when they were once sore
 bestead by a mighty host "A man," said Goll, "lives after his
 life, but not after his honour."</p>
 
 <p>
 Seven days was Finn absent, and he drove tbe
 Northmen</p>
 
 <p>
 [267]</p>
 
 <p>
 men from the shores of Erin. But on the
 eighth day he returned, and when he entered his dūn he saw trouble in the
 eyes of his men, and of their fair womenfolk, and Saba was not on the rampart
 expecting his return. So he bade them tell him what had chanced, and they said:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Whilst thou, our father and lord, wert
 afar oft smiting the foreigner, and Saba looking ever down the pass for thy
 return, we saw one day as it were the likeness of thee approaching, and Bran and
 Skolawn at thy heels. And we seemed also to hear the notes of the Fian
 hunting-call blown on the wind. Then Saba hastened to the great gate, and we
 could not stay her, so eager was she to rush to the phantom. But when she came
 near she halted and gave a loud and bitter cry, and the shape of thee smote her
 with a hazel wand, and lo, there was no woman there any more, but a deer. Then
 those hounds chased it, and ever as it strove to reach again the gate of the
 dūn they turned back. We all now seized what arms we could and ran out to
 drive away the enchanter, but when we reached the place there was nothing to be
 seen, only still we heard the rushing of flying feet and the baying of dogs, and
 one thought it came from here, and another from there, till at last the uproar
 died away and all was still. What we could do, O Finn, we did ; Saba is
 gone."</p>
 
 <p>
 Finn then struck his hand on his breast, but
 spoke no word, and he went to his own chamber. No man saw him for the rest of
 that day, nor for the day after. Then he came forth, and ordered the matters of
 the Fianna as of old, but for seven years thereafter he went searching for Saba
 through every remote glen and dark forest and cavern of Ireland, and he would
 take no hounds with him save Bran and Skolawn. But at last he renounced all hope
 of finding her again, and went hunting as of old.</p>
 
 <p>
 [268]</p>
 
 <p>
 One day as he was following the chase on Ben
 Bulban, in Sligo, he heard the musical bay of the dogs change of a sudden to a
 fierce growling and yelping, as though they were in combat with some beast, and
 running hastily up he and his men beheld, under a great tree, a naked boy with
 long hair, and around him the hounds struggling to seize him, but Bran and
 Skolawn fighting with them and keeping them off. And the lad was tall and
 shapely, and as the heroes gathered round he gazed undauntedly on them, never
 heeding the rout of dogs at his feet. The Fians beat off the dogs and brought
 the lad home with them, and Finn was very silent and continually searched the
 lad's countenance with his eyes. In time the use of speech came to him, and the
 story that he told was this:</p>
 
 <p>
 He had known no father, and no mother save a
 gentle hind, with whom he lived in a most green and pleasant valley shut in on
 every side by towering cliffs that could not be scaled or by deep chasms in the
 earth. In the summer he lived on fruits and suchlike, and in the winter store of
 provisions was laid for him in a cave. And there came to them sometimes a tall,
 dark-visaged man, who spoke to his mother, now tenderly, and now in loud menace,
 but she always shrank away in fear, and the man departed in anger. At last there
 came a day when the dark man spoke very long with his mother in all tones of
 entreaty and of tenderness and of rage, but she would still keep aloof and give
 no sign save of fear and abhorrence. Then at length the dark man drew near and
 smote her with a hazel wand; and with that he turned and went his way, but she
 this time followed him, still looking back at her son and piteously complaining.
 And he, when he strove to follow, found him-self unable to move a limb ; and
 crying out with rage and desolation he fell to the earth, and his senses left
 him.</p>
 
 <p>
 [269]</p>
 
 <p>
 When he came to himself he was on the
 mountain-side on Ben Bulban, where he remained some days, searching for that
 green and hidden valley, which he never found again. And after a while the dogs
 found him ; but of the hind his mother and of the Dark Druid there is no man
 knows the end.</p>
 
 <p>
 Finn called his name Oisin (Little Fawn), and
 he became a warrior of fame, but far more famous for the songs and tales that he
 made; so that of all things to this day that are told of the Fianna of Erin men
 are wont to say: "Thus sang the bard Oisin, son of Finn."</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Oisin and Niam</p>
 
 
 <p>
 It happened that on a misty summer morning as
 Finn and Oisin with many companions were hunting on the shores of Loch Lena they
 saw coming towards them a maiden, beautiful exceedingly, riding on a snow-white
 steed. She wore the garb of a queen; a crown of gold was on her head, and a
 dark-brown mantle of silk, set with stars of red gold, fell around her and
 trailed on the ground. Silver shoes were on her horse's hoofs, and a crest of
 gold nodded on his head. When she came near she said to Finn: "From very
 far away I have come, and now at last I have found thee, Finn son of
 Cumhal."</p>
 
 <p>
 Then Finn said: "What is thy land and
 race, maiden, and what dost thou seek from me?"</p>
 
 <p>
 "My name," she said," is Niam
 of the Golden Hair. I am the daughter of the King of the Land of Youth, and that
 which has brought me here is the love of thy son Oisin." Then she turned to
 Oisin, and she spoke to him in the voice of one who has never asked anything but
 it was granted to her.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Wilt thou go with me, Oisin, to my
 father's land?"</p>
 
 <p>
 And Oisin said: "That will I, and to the
 world's end"; for the fairy spell had so wrought. upon his</p>
 
 <p>
 [270]</p>
 
 <p>
 heart that he cared no more for any earthly
 thing but to have the love of Niam of the Head of Gold.</p>
 
 <p>
 Then the maiden spoke of the Land Oversea to
 which she had summoned her lover, and as she spoke a dreamy stillness fell on
 all things, nor did a horse shake his bit, nor a hound bay, nor the least breath
 of wind stir in the forest trees till she had made an end. And what she said
 seemed sweeter and more wonderful as she spoke it than anything they could
 afterwards remember to have heard, but so far as they could remember it it was
 this :</p>
 
 <p>
 "Delightful is the land beyond all
 dreams,<br>
 
 Fairer than aught thine eyes have ever seen.<br>
 
 There all the year the bloom is on the tree,<br>
 
 And all the year the bloom is on the flower.</p>
 
 <p>
 "There with wild honey drip the forest
 trees;<br>
 
 The stores of wine and mead shall never fail.<br>
 
 Nor pain nor sickness know, the dweller there,<br>
 
 Death and decay come near him never more.</p>
 
 <p>
 "The feast shall cloy not, nor the chase
 shall tire,<br>
 
 Nor music cease for ever through the hall ;<br>
 
 The gold and jewels of the Land of Youth<br>
 
 Outshine all splendours ever dreamed by man.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Thou shalt have horses of the fairy
 breed,<br>
 
 Thou shalt have hounds that can outrun the wind;<br>
 
 A hundred chiefs shall follow thee in war,<br>
 
 A hundred maidens sing thee to thy sleep.</p>
 
 <p>
 "A crown of sovranty thy brow shall
 wear,<br>
 
 And by thy side a magic blade shall hang,<br>
 
 And thou shalt be lord of all the Land of Youth,<br>
 
 And lord of Niam of the Head of Gold."</p>
 
 <p>
 As the magic song ended the Fians beheld
 Oisin mount the fairy steed and hold the maiden in his arms, and ere they could
 stir or speak she turned her horse's head and shook the ringing bridle, and down
 the forest glade they fled, as a beam of light flies over</p>
 
 <p>
 [271]</p>
 
 <p>
 the land when clouds drive across the sun;
 and never did the Fianna behold Oisin son of Finn on earth again.</p>
 
 <p>
 Yet what befell him afterwards is known. As
 his birth was strange, so was his end, for he saw the wonders of the Land of
 Youth with mortal eyes and lived to tell them with mortal lips.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Journey to Fairyland</p>
 
 
 <p>
 When the white horse with its riders reached
 the sea it ran lightly over the waves, and soon the green woods and headlands of
 Erin laded out of sight. And now the sun shone fiercely down, and the riders
 passed into a golden haze in which Oisin lost all knowledge of where he was or
 if sea or dry land were beneath his horse's hoofs. But strange sights sometimes
 appeared to them in the mist, for towers and palace gateways loomed up and
 disappeared, and once a hornless doe bounded by them chased by a white hound
 with one red ear; and again they saw a young maid ride by on a brown steed,
 bearing a golden apple in her hand, and close behind her followed a young
 horseman on a white steed, a purple cloak floating at his back and a gold-hilted
 sword in his hand. And Oisin would have asked the princess who and what these
 apparitions were, but Niam bade him ask nothing nor seem to notice any phantom
 they might see until they were come to the Land of Youth.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Oisin's Return</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The story goes on to tell how Oisin met with
 various adventures in the Land of Youth, including the rescue of an imprisoned
 princess from a Fomorian giant. But at last, after what seemed to him a sojourn
 of three weeks in the Land of Youth, he was satiated with delights of</p>
 
 <p>
 [272]</p>
 
 <p>
 every kind, and longed to visit his native
 land again and to see his old comrades. He promised to return when he had done
 so, and Niam gave him the white fairy steed that had borne him across the sea to
 Fairyland, but charged him that when he had reached the Land of Erin again he
 must never alight from its back nor touch the soil of the earthly world with his
 foot, or the way of return to the Land of Youth would be barred to him for ever.
 Oisin then set forth, and once more crossed the mystic ocean, finding himself at
 last on the western shores of Ireland. Here he made at once for the Hill of
 Allen, where the dūn of Finn was wont to be, but marvelled, as he traversed
 the woods, that he met no sign of the Fian hunters and at the small size of the
 folk whom he saw tilling the ground.</p>
 
 <p>
 At length, coming from the forest path into
 the great clearing where the Hill of Allen was wont to rise, broad and green,
 with its rampart enclosing many white-walled dwellings, and the great hall
 towering high in the midst, he saw but grassy mounds overgrown with rank weeds
 and whin bushes, and among them pastured a peasant's kine. Then a strange horror
 fell upon him and he thought some enchantment from the land of Faery held his
 eyes and mocked him with false visions. He threw his arms abroad and shouted the
 names of Finn and Oscar, but none replied, and he thought that perchance the
 hounds might hear him, so he cried upon Bran and Skolawn and strained his ears
 if they might catch the faintest rustle or whisper of the world from the sight
 of which his eyes were holden, but he heard only the sighing of the wind in the
 whins. Then he rode in terror from that place, setting his face towards the
 eastern sea, for he meant to traverse Ireland from side to side and end to end
 in search of some escape from his enchantment</p>
 
 <p>
 [273]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Broken Spell</p>
 
 
 <p>
 But when he came near to the eastern sea, and
 was now in the place which is called the Valley of the Thrushes, [Glanismole,
 near Dublin] he saw in a field upon the hillside a crowd of men striving to roll
 aside a great boulder from their tilled land, and an overseer directing them.
 Towards them he rode, meaning to ask them concerning Finn and the Fianna. As he
 came near they all stopped their work to gaze upon him, for to them he appeared
 like a messenger of the Fairy Folk or an angel from heaven. Taller and mightier
 he was than the men-folk they knew, with sword-blue eyes and brown, ruddy cheeks
 ; in his mouth, as it were, a shower of pearls, and bright hair clustered
 beneath the rim of his helmet. And as Oisin looked upon their puny forms, marred
 by toil and care, and at the stone which they feebly strove to heave from its
 bed, he was filled with pity, and thought to himself, "Not such were even
 the churls of Erin when I left them for the Land of Youth" and he stooped
 from his saddle to help them. He set his hand to the boulder, and with a mighty
 heave he lifted it from where it lay and set it rolling down the hill. And the
 men raised a shout of wonder and applause; but their shouting changed in a
 moment into cries of terror and dismay, and they fled, jostling and overthrowing
 each other to escape from the place of fear, for a marvel horrible to see had
 taken place. For Oisin's saddle-girth had burst as he heaved the Stone and he
 fell headlong to the ground. In an instant the white steed had vanished from
 their eyes like a wreath of mist, and that which rose, feeble and staggering,
 from the ground was no youthful warrior, but a man stricken with extreme old
 age, white-bearded and withered, who stretched out</p>
 
 <p>
 [274]</p>
 
 <p>
 groping hands and moaned with feeble and
 bitter cries. And his crimson cloak and yellow silken tunic were now but coarse
 homespun stuff tied with a hempen girdle, and the gold-hilted sword was a rough
 oaken staff such as a beggar carries who wanders the roads from farmer's house
 to house.</p>
 
 <p>
 When the people saw that the doom that had
 been wrought was not for them they returned, and found the old man prone on the
 ground with his face hidden in his arms. So they lifted him up, and asked who he
 was and what had befallen him. Oisin gazed round on them with dim eyes, and at
 last he said: "I was Oisin the son of Finn, and I pray ye tell me where he
 dwells, for his dūn on the Hill of Allen is now a desolation, and I have
 neither seen him nor heard his hunting-horn from the western to the eastern
 sea." Then the men gazed strangely on each other and on Oisin, and the
 overseer asked: " Of what Finn dost thou speak, for there be many of that
 name in Erin ? "</p>
 
 <p>
 Oisin said: " Surely of Finn mac Cumhal
 mac Trenmor, captain of the Fianna of Erin."</p>
 
 <p>
 Then the overseer said : "Thou art daft,
 old man, and thou hast made us daft to take thee for a youth as we did a while
 agone. But we at least have now our wits again, and we know that Finn son of
 Cumhal and all his generation have been dead these three hundred years. At the
 battle of Gowra fell Oscar, son of Oisin, and Finn at the battle of Brea, as the
 historians tell us and the lays of Oisin, whose death no man knows the manner
 of, are sung by our harpers at great men's feasts. But now the Talkenn,
 [Talkenn, or " Adze-head," was a name given to St. Patrick by the
 Irish. Probably it referred to the shape of his tonsure.] Patrick, has come into
 Ireland, and has preached to us the One God and Christ His Son, by whose might
 these old days and ways are done away with; and Finn and his Fianna, with their
 feasting</p>
 
 <p>
 [275]</p>
 
 <p>
 and hunting and songs of war and of love,
 have no such reverence among us as the monks and virgins of Holy Patrick, and
 the psalms and prayers that go up daily to cleanse us from sin and to save us
 from the fire of judgment. But Oisin replied, only half hearing and still less
 comprehending what was said to him "If thy God have slain Finn and Oscar, I
 would say that God is a strong man." Then they all cried out upon him, and
 some picked up stones, but the overseer bade them let him be until the Talkenn
 had spoken with him, and till he should order what was to be done.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Oisin and Patrick</p>
 
 
 <p>
 So they brought him to Patrick, who treated
 him gently and hospitably, and to Patrick he told the story of all that had
 befallen him. But Patrick bade his scribes write all carefully down, that the
 memory of the heroes whom Oisin had known, and of the joyous and free life they
 had led in the woods and glens and wild places of Erin, should never be
 forgotten among men.</p>
 
 <p>
 This remarkable legend is known only in the
 modern Irish poem written by Michael Comyn about 1750, a poem which may be
 called the swan-song of Irish literature. Doubtless Comyn worked on earlier
 traditional material ; but though the ancient Ossianic poems tell us of the
 prolongation of Oisin's life, so that he could meet St. Patrick and tell him
 stories of the Fianna, the episodes of Niam's courtship and the sojourn in the
 Land of Youth are known to us at present only in the poem of Michael Comyn.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Enchanted Cave</p>
 
 
 <p>
 This tale, which I take from S. H. O'Grady's
 edition in "Silva Gadelica," relates that Finn once made a great
 hunting in the district of Corann, in Northern Connacht,</p>
 
 <p>
 [276]</p>
 
 <p>
 which was ruled over by one Conaran, a lord
 of the Danaan Folk. Angered at the intrusion of the Fianna in his
 hunting-grounds, he sent his three sorcerer-daughters to take vengeance on the
 mortals.</p>
 
 <p>
 Finn, it is said, and Conan the Bald, with
 Finn's two favourite hounds, were watching the hunt from the top of the Hill of
 Keshcorran and listening to the cries of the beaters and the notes of the horn
 and the baying of the dogs, when, in moving about on the hill, they came upon
 the mouth of a great cavern, before which sat three hags of evil and revolting
 aspect. On three crooked sticks of holly they had twisted left-handwise hanks of
 yarn, and were spinning with these when Finn and his followers arrived. To view
 them more closely the warriors drew near, when they found themselves suddenly
 entangled in strands of the yarn which the hags had spun about the place like
 the web of a spider, and deadly faintness and trembling came over them, so that
 they were easily bound fast by the bags and carried into the dark recesses of
 the cave. Others of the party then arrived, looking for Finn. All suffered the
 same experience-they lost all their pith and valour at the touch of the
 bewitched yarn, and were bound and carried into the cave, until the whole party
 were laid in bonds, with the dogs baying and howling outside.</p>
 
 <p>
 The witches now seized their sharp,
 wide-channelled, hard-tempered swords, and were about to fall on the captives
 and slay them, but first they looked round at the mouth of the cave to see if
 there was any straggler whom they had not yet laid hold of. At this moment Goll
 mac Morna, "the raging lion, the torch of onset, the great of soul,"
 came up, and a desperate combat ensued, which ended by Goll cleaving two of the
 hags in twain, and then subduing and binding the third, whose name was Irnan.
 She, as he was about to slay</p>
 
 <p>
 [277]</p>
 
 <p>
 her, begged for mercy - " Surely it were
 better for thee to have the Fianna whole " - and he gave her her life if
 she would release the prisoners.</p>
 
 <p>
 Into the cave they went, and one by one the
 captives were unbound, beginning with the poet Fergus True-lips and the
 "men of science," and they all sat down on the hill to recover
 themselves, while Fergus sang a chant of praise in honour of the rescuer, Goll;
 and Irnan disappeared.</p>
 
 <p>
 Ere long a monster was seen approaching them,
 a "gnarled hag" with blazing, boodshot eyes, a yawning mouth full of
 ragged fangs, nails like a wild beast's, and armed like a warrior. She laid Finn
 under <i>geise </i>to provide her with single combat from among his men until
 she should have her fill of it. It was no other than the third sister, Irnan,
 whom Goll had spared. Finn in vain begged Oisin, Oscar, Keelta, and the other
 prime warriors of the Fianna to meet her; they all pleaded inability after the
 ill-treatment and contumely they had received. At last, as Finn himself was
 about to do battle with her, Goll said: "O Finn, combat with a crone
 beseems thee not," and he drew sword for a second battle with this horrible
 enemy. At last, after a desperate combat, he ran her through her shield and
 through her heart, so that the blade stuck out at the far side, and she fell
 dead. The Fianna then sacked the dūn of Conaran, and took possession of all
 the treasure in it, while Finn bestowed on Goll mac Morna his own daughter, Keva
 of the White Skin, and, leaving the dūn a heap of glowing embers, they
 returned to the Hill of Allen.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Chase of Slievegallion</p>
 
 
 <p>
 This fine story, which is given in poetical
 form, as if narrated by Oisin, in the Ossianic Society's
 "Transactions," tells how Cullan the Smith (here represented as</p>
 
 <p>
 [278]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 <br>
 
 <br>
 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 a Danaan divinity), who dwelt on or near the
 mountains <i>of </i>Slievegallion, in Co. Armagh, had two daughters, Ainé and
 Milucra, each of whom loved Finn mac Cumhal. They were jealous of each other;
 and on Ainé once happening to say that she would never have a man with grey
 hair, Milucra saw a means of securing Finn's love entirely for herself. So she
 assembled her friends among the Danaans round the little grey lake that lies on
 the top of Slievegallion, and they charged its waters with enchantments.</p>
 
 <p>
 This introduction, it may be observed, bears
 strong signs of being a later addition to the original tale, made in a less
 understanding age or by a less thoughtful class into whose hands the legend had
 descended. The real meaning of the transformation which it narrates is probably
 much deeper.</p>
 
 <p>
 The story goes on to say that not long after
 this the hounds of Finn, Bran and Skolawn, started a fawn near the Hill of
 Allen, and ran it northwards till the chase ended on the top of Slievegallion, a
 mountain which, like Slievenamon [pronounced "Sleeve-na-moń" :
 accent on last syllable. It means the Mountain of the [Fairy] Women.] in the
 south, was in ancient Ireland a veritable focus of Danaan magic and legendary
 lore. Finn followed the hounds alone till the fawn disappeared on the
 mountain-side. In searching for it Finn at last came on the little lake which
 lies on the top of the mountain, and saw by its brink a lady of wonderful
 beauty, who sat there lamenting and weeping. Finn asked her the cause of her
 grief. She explained that a gold ring which she dearly prized had fallen from
 her finger into the lake, and she charged Finn by the bonds of <i>geise </i>that
 he should plunge in and find it for her.</p>
 
 <p>
 Finn did so, and after diving into every
 recess of the</p>
 
 <p>
 [279]</p>
 
 <p>
 lake he discovered the ring, and before
 leaving the water gave it to the lady. She immediately plunged into the lake and
 disappeared. Finn then surmised that some enchantment was being wrought on him,
 and ere long he knew what it was, for on stepping forth on dry land he fell down
 from sheer weakness, and arose again, a tottering and feeble old man,
 snowy-haired and withered, so that even his faithful hounds did not know him,
 but ran round the lake searching for their lost master.</p>
 
 <p>
 Meantime Finn was missed from his palace on
 the Hill of Allen, and a party soon set out on the track on which he had been
 seen to chase the deer. They came to the lake-side on Slievegallion, and found
 there a wretched and palsied old man, whom they questioned, but who could do
 nothing but beat his breast and moan. At last, beckoning Keelta to come near,
 the aged man whispered faintly some words into his ear, and lo, it was Finn
 himself ! When the Fianna had ceased from their cries of wonder and lamentation,
 Finn whispered to Keelta the tale of his enchantment, and told them that the
 author of it must be the daughter of Cullan the Smith, who dwelt in the Fairy
 Mound of Slievegallion. The Fianna, bearing Finn on a litter, immediately went
 to the Mound and began to dig fiercely. For three days and nights they dug at
 the Fairy Mound, and at last penetrated to its inmost recesses, when a maiden
 suddenly stood before them holding a drinking-horn of red gold. It was given to
 Finn. He drank from it, and at once his beauty and form were restored to him,
 but his hair still remained white as silver. This too would have been restored
 by another draught, but Finn let it stay as it was, and silver-white his hair
 remained to the day of his death.</p>
 
 <p>
 The tale has been made the subject of a very
 striking</p>
 
 <p>
 [280]</p>
 
 <p>
 allegorical drama, "The Masque of
 Finn," by Mr. Standish O'Grady, who, rightly no doubt, interprets the story
 as symbolising the acquisition of wisdom and understanding through suffering. A
 leader of men must descend into the lake of tears and know feeble-ness and
 despair before his spirit can sway them to great ends.</p>
 
 <p>
 There is an antique sepulchral monument on
 the mountain-top which the peasantry of the district still regard - or did in
 the days before Board schools - as the abode of the "Witch of the
 Lake" ; and a mysterious beaten path, which was never worn by the passage
 of human feet, and which leads from the rock sepulchre to the lake-side, is
 ascribed to the going to and fro of this supernatural being.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The "Colloquy of the Ancients"</p>
 
 
 <p>
 One of the most interesting and attractive of
 the relics of Ossianic literature is the "Colloquy of the Ancients," <i>Agallamh
 na Senorach, </i>a long narrative piece dating from about the thirteenth
 century. It has been published with a translation in O'Grady's "Silva
 Gadelica." It is not so much a story as a collection of stories skilfully
 set in a mythical framework. The "Colloquy" opens by presenting us
 with the figures of Keelta mac Ronan and Oisin son of Finn, each accompanied by
 eight warriors, all that are left of the great fellowship of the Fianna after
 the battle of Gowra and the subsequent dispersion of the Order. A vivid picture
 is given us of the grey old warriors, who had outlived their epoch, meeting for
 the last time at the dūn of a once famous chieftainess named Camha, and of
 their melancholy talk over bygone days, till at last a long silence settled on
 them.</p>
 
 <p>
 [281]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Keelta Meets St. Patrick</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Finally Keelta and Oisin resolve to part,
 Oisin, of whom we hear little more, going to the Fairy Mound, where his Danaan
 mother (here called Blai) has her dwelling, while Keelta takes his way over the
 plains of Meath till he comes to Drumderg, where he lights on St. Patrick and
 his monks. How this is chronologically possible the writer does not trouble
 himself to explain, and he shows no knowledge of the legend of Oisin in the Land
 of Youth. "The clerics," says the story, "saw Keelta and his band
 draw near them, and fear fell on them before the tall men with the huge
 wolf-hounds that accompanied them, for they were not people of one epoch or of
 one time with the clergy." Patrick then sprinkles the heroes with holy
 water, whereat legions of demons who had been hovering over them fly away into
 the hills and glens, and "the enormous men sat down." Patrick, after
 inquiring the name of his guest, then says he has a boon to crave of him - he
 wishes to find a well of pure water with which to baptize the folk of Bregia and
 of Meath.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Well of Tradaban</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Keelta, who knows every brook and hill and
 rath and wood in the country, thereon takes Patrick by the hand and leads him
 away " till," as the writer says, "right in front of them they
 saw a loch-well, sparkling and translucid. The size and thickness of the cress
 and of the <i>fothlacht, </i>or brooklime, that grew on it was a wonderment to
 them." Then Keelta began to tell of the fame and qualities of the place,
 and uttered an exquisite little lyric in praise of it :</p>
 
 <p>
 "O Well of the Strand of the Two Women,
 beautiful are thy cresses, luxuriant, branching ; since thy produce</p>
 
 <p>
 [282]</p>
 
 <p>
 is neglected on thee thy brooklime is not
 suffered to grow. Forth from thy banks thy trout are to be seen, thy wild swine
 in the wilderness ; the deer of thy fair hunting crag-land, thy dappled and
 red-chested fawns ! Thy mast all hanging on the branches of the trees ; thy fish
 in estuaries of the rivers; lovely the colours of thy purling streams, O thou
 that art azure-hued, and again green with reflections of surrounding
 copse-wood." [translation by S. H. O'Grady]</p>
 
 <p>

 St. Patrick and Irish Legend</p>
 
 
 <p>
 After the warriors have been entertained
 Patrick asks :</p>
 
 <p>
 "Was he, Finn mac Cumhal, a good lord
 with whom ye were ?" Keelta praises the generosity of Finn, and goes on to
 describe in detail the glories of his household, whereon Patrick says :</p>
 
 <p>
 "Were it not for us an impairing of the
 devout life, an occasion of neglecting prayer, and of deserting converse with
 God, we, as we talked with thee, would feel the time pass quickly, warrior
 !"</p>
 
 <p>
 Keelta goes on with another tale of the
 Fianna, and Patrick, now fairly caught in the toils of the enchanter, cries
 "Success and benediction attend thee, Keelta ! This is to me a lightening
 of spirit and mind. And now tell us another tale."</p>
 
 <p>
 So ends the exordium of the
 "Colloquy." As usual in the openings of Irish tales, nothing could be
 better contrived ; the touch is so light, there is so happy a mingling of
 pathos, poetry, and humour, and so much dignity in the sketching of the human
 characters introduced. The rest of the piece consists in the exhibition of a
 vast amount of topographical and legendary lore by Keelta, attended by the
 invariable "Success and benediction attend thee !" of Patrick.</p>
 
 <p>
 They move together, the warrior and the
 saint, on</p>
 
 <p>
 [283]</p>
 
 <p>
 Patrick's journey to Tara, and whenever
 Patrick or some one else in the company sees a hill or a fort<i> </i>or a well
 he asks Keelta what it is, and Keelta tells its name and a Fian legend to
 account for it, and so the story wanders on through a maze of legendary lore
 until they are met by a company from Tara, with the king at its head, who then
 takes up the <i>role </i>of questioner. The "Colloquy," as we have it
 now, breaks off abruptly as the story how the <i>Lia Fail </i>was carried off
 from Ireland is about to be narrated. [see p. 105] The interest of the
 "Colloquy" lies in the tales of Keelta and the lyrics introduced in
 the course of them. Of the tales there are about a hundred, telling of Fian
 raids and battles, and love-makings and feastings, but the greater number of
 them have to do with the intercourse between the Fairy Folk and the Fianna. With
 these folk the Fianna have constant relations, both of love and of war. Some of
 the tales are of great elaboration, wrought out in the highest style of which
 the writer was capable. One of the best is that of the fairy <i>Brugh</i>, or
 mansion of Slievenamon, which Patrick and Keelta chance to pass by, and of which
 Keelta tells the following history:</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Brugh of Slieyenamon</p>
 
 
 <p>
 One day as Finn and Keelta and five other
 champions of the Fianna were hunting at Torach, in the north, they roused a
 beautiful fawn which fled before them, they holding it in chase all day, till
 they reached the mountain of Slievenamon towards evening, when the fawn suddenly
 seemed to vanish underground. A chase like this, in the Ossianic literature, is
 the common prelude to an adventure in Fairyland. Night now fell rapidly, and
 with it came heavy snow and storm, and, searching for shelter, the Fianna
 discovered in the</p>
 
 <p>
 [284]</p>
 
 <p>
 wood a great illuminated <i>Brugh</i>, or
 mansion, where they sought admittance. On entering they found themselves in a
 spacious hall, full of light, with eight-and-twenty warriors and as many fair
 and yellow-haired maidens, one of the latter seated on a chair of crystal, and
 making wonderful music on a harp. After the Fian warriors have been entertained
 with the finest of viands and liquors, it is explained to them that their hosts
 are Donn, son of Midir the Proud, and his brother, and that they are at war with
 the rest of the Danaan Folk, and have to do battle with them thrice yearly on
 the green before the <i>Brugh. </i>At first each of the twenty-eight had a
 thousand warriors under him. Now all are slain except those present, and the
 survivors have sent out one of their maidens in the shape of a fawn to entice
 the Fianna to their fairy palace and to gain their aid in the battle that must
 be delivered to-morrow. We have, in fact, a variant of the well-known theme of
 the Rescue of Fairyland. Finn and his companions are always ready for a fray,
 and a desperate battle ensues which lasts from evening till morning, for the
 fairy host attack at night. The assailants are beaten off<i>, </i>losing over a
 thousand of their number ; but Oscar, Dermot, and mac Luga are sorely wounded.
 They are healed by magical herbs and more fighting and other adventures follow,
 until, after a year has passed, Finn compels the enemy to make peace and give
 hostages, when the Fianna return to earth and rejoin their fellows. No sooner
 has Keelta finished his tale, standing on the very spot where they had found the
 fairy palace on the night of snow, than a young warrior is seen approaching
 them. He is thus described : "A shirt of royal satin was next his skin ;
 over and outside it a tunic of the same fabric; and a fringed crimson mantle,
 confined with a bodkin</p>
 
 <p>
 [285]</p>
 
 <p>
 of gold, upon his breast; in his hand a
 gold-hilted sword, and a golden helmet on his head." A delight in the
 colour and material splendour of life is a very marked feature in all this
 literature. This splendid figure turns out to be Donn mac Midir, one of the
 eight-and-twenty whom Finn had succoured, and he comes to do homage for himself
 and his people to St. Patrick, who accepts entertainment from him for the night
 ; for in the "Colloquy" the relations of the Church and of the Fairy
 World are very cordial.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Three Young Warriors</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Nowhere in Celtic literature does the love of
 wonder and mystery find such remarkable expression as in the
 "Colloquy." The writer of this piece was a master of the touch that
 makes, as it were, the solid framework of things translucent; and shows us,
 through it, gleams of another world, mingled with ours yet distinct, and having
 other laws and characteristics. We never get a clue as to what these laws are.
 The Celt did not, in Ireland at least, systematise the unknown, but let it shine
 for a moment through the opaqueness of this earth and then withdrew the gleam
 before we understood what we had seen. Take, for instance, this incident in
 Keelta's account of the Fianna. Three young warriors come to take service with
 Finn, accompanied by a gigantic hound. They make their agreement with him,
 saying what services they can render and what reward they expect, and they make
 it a condition that they shall camp apart from the rest of the host, and that
 when night has fallen no man shall come near them or see them.</p>
 
 <p>
 Finn asks the reason for this prohibition,
 and it is this: of the three warriors one has to die each night, and the other
 two must watch him; therefore they would not</p>
 
 <p>
 [286]</p>
 
 <p>
 he disturbed. There is no explanation of
 this; the writer simply leaves us with the thrill of the mystery upon us.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Fair Giantess</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Again, let us turn to the tale of the Fair
 Giantess. One day Finn and his warriors, while resting from the chase for their
 midday meal, saw coming towards them a towering shape. It proved to be a young
 giant maiden, who gave her name as Vivionn (Bebhionn) daughter of Treon, from
 the Land of Maidens. The gold rings on her fingers were as thick as an ox's
 yoke, and her beauty was dazzling. When she took off her gilded helmet, all
 bejewelled, her fair, curling golden hair broke out in seven score tresses, and
 Finn cried "Great gods whom we adore, a huge marvel Cormac and Ethné and
 the women of the Fianna would esteem it to see Vivionn, the blooming daughter of
 Treon." The maiden explained that she had been betrothed against her will
 to a suitor named AEda, son of a neighbouring king; and that hearing from a
 fisherman, who had been blown to her shores, of the power and nobleness of Finn,
 she had come to seek his protection. While she was speaking, suddenly the Fianna
 were aware of another giant form close at hand. It was a young man,
 smooth-featured and of surpassing beauty, who bore a red shield and a huge
 spear. Without a word he drew near, and before the wondering Fianna could accost
 him he thrust his spear through the body of the maiden and passed away. Finn,
 enraged at this violation of his protection, called on his chiefs to pursue and
 slay the murderer. Keelta and others chased him to the sea-shore, and followed
 him into the surf, but he strode out to sea, and was met by a great galley which
 bore him away to unknown regions. Returning, discomfited, to Finn, they found
 the girl</p>
 
 <p>
 [287]</p>
 
 <p>
 dying. She distributed her gold and jewels
 among them, and the Fianna buried her under a great mound, and raised a pillar
 stone over her with her name in Ogham letters, in the place since called the
 Ridge of the Dead Woman.</p>
 
 <p>
 In this tale we have, besides the element of
 mystery, that of beauty. It is an association of frequent occurrence in this
 period of Celtic literature ; and to this, perhaps, is due the fact that
 although these tales seem to come from nowhither and to lead nowhither, but move
 in a dream-world where there is no chase but seems to end in Fairyland and no
 combat that has any relation to earthly needs or objects, where all realities
 are apt to dissolve in a magic light and to change their shapes like morning
 mist, yet they linger in the memory with that haunting charm which has for many
 centuries kept them alive by the fireside of the Gaelic peasant.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 St. Patrick, Oisin, and Keelta</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Before we leave the " Colloquy "
 another interesting point must be mentioned in connexion with it. To the general
 public probably the best-known things in Ossianic literature - I refer, of
 course, to the true Gaelic poetry which goes under that name, not to the
 pseudo-Ossian of Macpherson - are those dialogues in which the pagan and the
 Christian ideals are contrasted, often in a spirit of humorous exaggeration or
 of satire. The earliest of these pieces are found in the manuscript called
 "The Dean of Lismore's Book," in which James Macgregor, Dean of
 Lismore in Argyllshire, wrote down, some time before the year 1518, all he could
 remember or discover of traditional Gaelic poetry in his time. It may be
 observed that up to this period, and, indeed, long after it, Scottish and Irish
 Gaelic were one language and one literature, the great written monuments of
 which were in Ireland, though they</p>
 
 <p>
 [288]</p>
 
 <p>
 belonged just as much to the Highland Celt,
 and the two branches of the Gael had an absolutely common stock of poetic
 tradition. These Oisin-and-Patrick dialogues are found in abundance both in
 Ireland and in the Highlands, though, as I have said, "The Dean of
 Lismore's Book " is their first written record now extant. What relation,
 then, do these dialogues bear to the Keelta-and-Patrick dialogues with which we
 make acquaintance in the "Colloquy" ? The questions which really came
 first, where they respectively originated, and what current of thought or
 sentiment each represented, constitute, as Mr. Alfred Nutt has pointed out, a
 literary problem of the greatest interest; and one which no critic has yet
 attempted to solve, or, indeed, until quite lately, even to call attention to.
 For though these two attempts to represent, in imaginative and artistic form,
 the contact of paganism with Christianity are nearly identical in machinery and
 framework, save that one is in verse and the other in prose, yet they differ
 widely in their point of view.</p>
 
 <p>
 In the Oisin dialogues [examples of these
 have been published, with translations, in the "Transactions of the
 Ossianic Society"] there is a great deal of rough humour and of crude
 theology, resembling those of an English miracle-play rather than any Celtic
 product that I am acquainted with. St. Patrick in these ballads, as Mr. Nutt
 remarks, " is a sour and stupid fanatic, harping with wearisome monotony on
 the damnation of Finn and all his comrades; a hard taskmaster to the poor old
 blind giant to whom he grudges food, and upon whom he plays shabby tricks in
 order to terrify him into acceptance of Christianity." Now in the
 "Colloquy" there is not one word of all this. Keelta embraces
 Christianity with a wholehearted reverence, and salvation is not denied to the
 friends and companions of his youth.</p>
 
 <p>
 [289]</p>
 
 <p>
 Patrick, indeed, assures Keelta of the
 salvation of several of them, including Finn himself. One of the Danaan Folk,
 who has been bard to the Fianna, delighted Patrick with his minstrelsy. Brogan,
 the scribe whom St. Patrick is employing to write down the Fian legends, says:
 " If music there is in heaven, why should there not be on earth ? Wherefore
 it is not right to banish minstrelsy." Patrick made answer : "Neither
 say I any such thing"; and, in fact, the minstrel is promised heaven for
 his art.</p>
 
 <p>
 Such are the pleasant relations that prevail
 in the "Colloquy" between the representatives of the two epochs.
 Keelta represents all that is courteous, dignified, generous, and valorous in
 paganism, and Patrick all that is benign and gracious in Christianity ; and
 instead of the two epochs standing over against each other in violent
 antagonism, and separated by an impassable gulf, all the finest traits in each
 are seen to harmonise with and to supplement those of the other.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Tales of Dermot</p>
 
 
 <p>
 A number of curious legends centre on Dermot
 O'Dyna, who has been referred to as one of Finn mac Cumhal's most notable
 followers. He might be described as a kind of Gaelic Adonis, a type of beauty
 and attraction, the hero of innumerable love tales; and, like Adonis, his death
 was caused by a wild boar.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Boar of Ben Bulben</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The boar was no common beast. The story of
 its origin was as follows: Dermot's father, Donn, gave the child to be nurtured
 by Angus Og in his palace on the Boyne. His mother, who was unfaithful to Don n,
 bore another child to Roc, the steward of Angus. Donn, one day, when the
 steward's child ran between his knees to escape from some hounds that were
 fighting on the</p>
 
 <p>
 [290]</p>
 
 <p>
 floor of the hall, gave him a squeeze with
 his two knees that killed him on the spot, and he then flung the body among the
 hounds on the floor. When the steward found his son dead, and discovered (with
 Finn's aid) the cause of it, he brought a Druid rod and smote the body with it,
 whereupon, in place of the dead child, there arose a huge boar, without ears or
 tail ; and to it he spake: "I charge you to bring Dermot O'Dyna to his
 death"; and the boar rushed out from the hall and roamed in the forests of
 Ben Bulben in Co. Sligo till the time when his destiny should be fulfilled.</p>
 
 <p>
 But Dermot grew up into a splendid youth,
 tireless in the chase, undaunted in war, beloved by all his comrades of the
 Fianna, whom he joined as soon as he was of age to do so.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 How Dermot Got the Love Spot</p>
 
 
 <p>
 He was called Dermot of the Love Spot, arid a
 curious and beautiful folk-tale recorded by Dr. Douglas Hyde [taken down from
 the recital of a peasant in Co. Galway and published at Rennes in Dr. Hyde's
 "An Sgeuluidhe Gaodhlach," vol. ii. (no translation).] tells how he
 got this appellation. With three comrades, Goll, Conan, and Oscar, he was
 hunting one day, and late at night they sought a resting-place. They soon found
 a hut, in which were an old man, a young girl, a wether sheep, and a cat. Here
 they asked for hospitality, and it was granted to them. But, as usual in these
 tales, it was a house of mystery.</p>
 
 <p>
 When they sat down to dinner the wether got
 up and mounted on the table. One after another the Fianna strove to throw it
 off, but it shook them down on the floor. At last Goll succeeded in flinging it
 off the table, but him too it vanquished in the end, and put them all under its
 feet. Then the old man bade the cat lead</p>
 
 <p>
 [291]</p>
 
 <p>
 the wether back and fasten it up, and it did
 so easily. The four champions, overcome with shame, were for leaving the house
 at once; but the old man explained that they had suffered no discredit - the
 wether they had been fighting with was the World, and the cat was the power that
 would destroy the world itself, namely, Death.</p>
 
 <p>
 At night the four heroes went to rest in a
 large chamber, and the young maid came to sleep in the same room; and it is said
 that her beauty made a light on the walls of the room like a candle. One after
 another the Fianna went over to her couch, but she repelled them all. "I
 belonged to you once," she said to each, "and I never will
 again." Last of all Dermot went. "O Dermot," she said, "you,
 also, I belonged to once, and I never can again, for I am Youth; but come here
 and I will put a mark on you so that no woman can ever see you without loving
 you." Then she touched his forehead, and left the Love Spot there; and that
 drew the love of women to him as long as he lived.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Chase of the Hard Gilly</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The Chase of the Gilla Dacar is another Fian
 tale in which Dermot plays a leading part. The Fianna, the story goes, were
 hunting one day on the hills and through the woods of Munster, and as Finn and
 his captains stood on a hillside listening to the baying of the hounds, and the
 notes of the Fian hunting-horn from the dark wood below, they saw coming towards
 them a huge, ugly, misshapen churl dragging along by a halter a great raw-boned
 mare. He announced himself as wishful to take service with Finn. The name he was
 called by, he said, was the Gilla Dacar (the Hard Gilly), because he was the
 hardest servant ever a lord had to get service or obedience from. In spite of
 this</p>
 
 <p>
 [292]</p>
 
 <p>
 unpromising beginning, Finn, whose principle
 it was never to re use an suitor, took him into service ; and the Fianna now
 began to make their uncouth comrade the butt of all sorts of rough jokes, which
 ended in thirteen of them, including Conan the Bald, all mounting up on the
 Gilla Dacar's steed. On this the newcomer complained that he was being mocked,
 and he shambled away in great discontent till he was over the ridge of the hill,
 when he tucked up his skirts and ran westwards, faster than any March wind,
 toward the sea-shore in Co. Kerry. Thereupon at once the steed, which had stood
 still with drooping ears while the thirteen riders in vain belaboured it to make
 it move, suddenly threw up its head and started off in a furious gallop after
 its master. The Fianna ran alongside, as well as they could for laughter, while
 Conan, in terror and rage, reviled them for not rescuing him and his comrades.
 At last the thing became serious. The Gilla Dacar plunged into the sea, and the
 mare followed him with her thirteen riders, and one more who managed to cling to
 her tail just as she left the shore; and all of them soon disappeared towards
 the fabled region of the West.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Dermot at the Well</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Finn and the remaining Fianna now took
 counsel together as to what should be done, and finally decided to fit out a
 ship and go in search of their comrades. After many days of voyaging they
 reached an island guarded by precipitous cliffs. Dermot O'Dyna, as the most
 agile of the party, was sent to climb them and to discover, if he could, some
 means of helping up the rest of the party. When he arrived at the top he found
 himself in a delightful land, full of the song of birds and the humming of bees
 and the murmur of streams,</p>
 
 <p>
 [293]</p>
 
 <p>
 but with no sign of habitation. Going into a
 dark forest, he soon came to a well, by which hung a curiously wrought
 drinking-horn. As he filled it to drink, a low, threatening murmur came from the
 well, but his thirst was too keen to let him heed it and he drank his fill. In
 no long time there came through the wood an armed warrior, who violently
 upbraided him for drinking from his well. The Knight of the Well and Dermot then
 fought all the afternoon without either of them prevailing over the other, when,
 as evening drew on, the knight suddenly leaped into the well and disappeared.
 Next day the same thing happened; on the third, however, Dermot, as the knight
 was about to take his leap, flung his arms round him, and both went down
 together.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Rescue of Fairyland</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Dermot, after a moment of darkness and
 trance, now found himself in Fairyland. A man of noble appearance roused him and
 led him away to the castle of a great king, where he was hospitably entertained.
 It was explained to him that the services of a champion like himself were needed
 to do combat against a rival monarch of Faery. It is the same motive which we
 find in the adventures of Cuchulain with Fand, and which so frequently turns up
 in Celtic fairy lore. Finn and his companions, finding that Dermot did not
 return to them, found their way up the cliffs, and, having traversed the forest,
 entered a great cavern which ultimately led them out to the same land as that in
 which Dermot had arrived. There too, they are informed, are the fourteen Fianna
 who had been carried off on the mare of the Hard Gilly. He, of course, was the
 king who needed their services, and who had taken this method of decoying some
 thirty of the flower of Irish fighting men to his side. Finn and his men go into
 the battle with the best of goodwill,</p>
 
 <p>
 [294]</p>
 
 <p align="center">
 <br>
 
 <br>
 
 </p>
 
 <p>
 and scatter the enemy like chaff; Oscar slays
 the son of the rival king (who is called the King of "Greece"). Finn
 wins the love of his daughter, Tasha of the White Arms, and the story closes
 with a delightful mixture of gaiety and mystery. "What reward wilt thou
 have for thy good services?" asks the fairy king of Finn. "Thou wert
 once in service with me," replies Finn, "and I mind not that I gave
 thee any recompense. Let one service stand against the other." " Never
 shall I agree to that," cries Conan the Bald. "Shall I have nought for
 being carried off on thy wild mare and haled over-sea?" "What wilt
 thou have?" asks the fairy king. "None of thy gold or goods,"
 replies Conan "but mine honour hath suffered, and let mine honour be
 appeased. Set thirteen of thy fairest womenfolk on the wild mare, O King, and
 thine own wife clinging to her tail, and let them be transported to Erin in like
 manner as we were dragged here, and I shall deem the indignity we have suffered
 fitly<i> </i>atoned for." On this the king smiled and, turning to Finn,
 said : "O Finn, behold thy men." Finn turned to look at them, but when
 he looked round again the scene had changed - the fairy king and his host and
 all the world of Faery had disappeared, and he found himself with his companions
 and the fair-armed Tasha standing on the beach of the little bay in Kerry whence
 the Hard Gilly and the mare had taken the water and carried off his men. And
 then all started with cheerful hearts for the great standing camp of the Fianna
 on the Hill of Allen to celebrate the wedding feast of Finn and Tasha.</p>

 Effect of Christianity on the Development of
 Irish Literature</p>
 
 
 <p>
 This tale with its fascinating mixture of
 humour, romance, magic, and love of wild nature, may be taken a typical specimen
 of the Fian legends at their best.</p>
 
 <p>
 [295]</p>
 
 <p>
 As compared with the Conorian legends they
 show, as I have pointed out, a characteristic lack of any heroic or serious
 element. That nobler strain died out with the growing predominance of
 Christianity, which appropriated for definitely religious purposes the more
 serious and lofty side of the Celtic genius, leaving for secular literature only
 the elements of wonder and romance. So completely was this carried out that
 while the Finn legends have survived to this day among the Gaelic-speaking
 population, and were a subject of literary treatment as long as Gaelic was
 written at all, the earlier cycle perished almost completely out of the popular
 remembrance, or survived only in distorted forms ; and but for the early
 manuscripts in which the tales are fortunately enshrined such a work as the
 "Tam Bo Cuailgné" - the greatest thing undoubtedly which the Celtic
 genius ever produced in literature - would now be irrecoverably lost.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Tales of Deirdre and of Grania</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Nothing can better illustrate the difference
 between the two cycles than a comparison of the tale of Deirdre with that with
 which we have now to deal - the tale of Dermot and Grania. The latter, from one
 point of view, reads like an echo of the former, so close is the resemblance
 between them in the outline of the plot. Take the following skeleton story:
 "A fair maiden is betrothed to a renowned and mighty suitor much older than
 herself. She turns from him to seek a younger lover, and fixes her attention on
 one of his followers, a gallant and beautiful youth, whom she persuades, in
 spite of his reluctance, to fly with her. After evading pursuit they settle down
 for a while at a distance from the defrauded lover, who bides his time, till at
 last, under cover of a treacherous reconciliation, he procures the death of his
 younger rival and retakes</p>
 
 <p>
 [296]</p>
 
 <p>
 possession of the lady." Were a student
 of Celtic legend asked to listen to the above synopsis, and to say to what Irish
 tale it referred, he would certainly reply that it must be either the tale of
 the Pursuit of Dermot and Grania, or that of the Fate of the Sons of Usna but
 which of them it was it would be quite impossible for him to tell. Yet in tone
 and temper the two stories are as wide apart as the poles.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Grania and Dermot</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Grania, in the Fian story, is the daughter of
 Cormac mac Art, High King of Ireland. She is betrothed to Finn mac Cumhal, whom
 we are to regard at this period as an old and war-worn but still mighty warrior.
 The famous captains of the Fianna all assemble at Tara for the wedding feast,
 and as they sit at meat Grania surveys them and asks their names of her father's
 Druid, Dara. "It is a wonder," she says, "that Finn did not ask
 me for Oisin, rather than for himself." "Oisin would not dare to take
 thee," says Dara. Grania, after going through all the company, asks
 "Who is that man with the spot on his brow, with the sweet voice, with
 curling dusky hair and ruddy cheek ?" "That is Dermot O'Dyna,"
 replies the Druid, "the white-toothed, of the lightsome countenance, in all
 the world the best lover of women and maidens." Grania now prepares a
 sleepy draught, which she places in a drinking-cup and passes round by her
 handmaid to the king, to Finn, and to all the company except the chiefs of the
 Fianna. When the draught has done its work she goes to Oisin. "Wilt thou
 receive courtship from me, Oisin ?" she asks. "That will I not,"
 says Oisin, "nor from any woman that is betrothed to Finn." Grania,
 who knew very well what Oisin's answer would be, now turns to her real mark,
 Dermot. He at first refuses to have</p>
 
 <p>
 [297]</p>
 
 <p>
 anything to do with her. "I put thee
 under bonds <i>[geise], </i>O Dermot, that thou take me out of Tara
 to-night." "Evil are these bonds, Grania," says Dermot; "and
 wherefore hast thou put them on me before all the kings' sons that feast at this
 table?" Grania then explains that she has loved Dermot ever since she saw
 him, years ago, from her sunny bower, take part in and win a great hurling match
 on the green at Tara. Dermot, still very reluctant, pleads the merits of Finn,
 and urges also that Finn has the keys of the royal fortress, so that they cannot
 pass out at night. "There is a secret wicket-gate in my bower," says
 Grania. "I am under <i>geise</i> not to pass through any wicket-gate,"
 replies Dermot, still struggling against his destiny. Grania will have none of
 these subterfuges - any Fian warrior, she has been told, can leap over a
 palisade with the aid of his spear as a jumping-pole; and she goes oft to make
 ready for the elopement. Dermot, in great perplexity, appeals to Oisin, Oscar,
 Keelta, and the others as to what he should do. They all bid him keep his <i>geise</i>
 - the bonds that Grania had laid on him to succour her-and he takes leave of
 them with tears.</p>
 
 <p>
 Outside the wicket-gate he again begs Grania
 to return. "It is certain that I will not go back," says Grania,
 "nor part from thee till death part us." "Then go forward, O
 Grania," says Dermot. After they had gone a mile, "I am truly weary, O
 grandson of Dyna," says Grania. "It is a good time to be weary,"
 says Dermot, making a last effort to rid himself of the entanglement, "and
 return now to thy household again, for I pledge the word of a true warrior that
 I will never carry thee nor any other woman to all eternity." "There
 is no need," replies Grania, and she directs him where to find horses and a
 chariot, and Dermot, now finally</p>
 
 <p>
 [298]</p>
 
 <p>
 accepting the inevitable, yokes them, and
 they proceed on their way to the Ford of Luan on the Shannon. [now Athlone (<i>Atha
 Luian</i>)</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Pursuit</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Next day Finn, burning with rage, sets out
 with his warriors on their track. He traces out each of their halting-places,
 and finds the hut of wattles which Dermot has made for their shelter, and the
 bed of soft rushes, and the remains of the meal they had eaten. And at each
 place he finds a piece of unbroken bread or uncooked salmon - Dermot's subtle
 message to Finn that he has respected the rights of his lord and treated Grania
 as a sister. But this delicacy of Dermot's is not at all to Grania's mind, and
 she conveys her wishes to him in a manner which is curiously paralleled by an
 episode in the tale of Tristan and Iseult of Brittany, as told by Heinrich von
 Freiberg. They are passing through a piece of wet ground when a splash of water
 strikes Grania. She turns to her companion:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Thou art a mighty warrior, O Dermot, in
 battle and sieges and forays, yet meseems that this drop of water is bolder than
 thou." This hint that he was keeping at too respectful a distance was taken
 by Dermot. The die is now cast, and he will never again meet Finn and his old
 comrades except at the point of the spear.</p>
 
 <p>
 The tale now loses much of the originality
 and charm of its opening scene, and recounts in a somewhat mechanical manner a
 number of episodes in which Dermot is attacked or besieged by the Fianna, and
 rescues himself and his lady by miracles of boldness or dexterity, or by aid of
 the magical devices of his foster-father, Angus Og. They are chased all over
 Ireland, and the dolmens in that country are popularly associated</p>
 
 <p>
 [299]</p>
 
 <p>
 with them, being called in the traditions of
 the peasantry "Beds of Dermot and Grania"</p>
 
 <p>
 Grania's character is drawn throughout with
 great consistency. She is not an heroic woman - hers are not the simple, ardent
 impulses and unwavering devotion of a Deirdre. The latter is far more primitive.
 Grania is a curiously modern and what would be called "neurotic" type
 - wilful, restless, passionate, but full of feminine fascination.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Dermot and Finn Make Peace</p>
 
 
 <p>
 After sixteen years of outlawry peace is at
 last made for Dermot by the mediation of Angus with King Cormac and with Finn.
 Dermot receives his proper patrimony, the Cantred of O'Dyna, and other lands far
 away in the West, and Cormac gives another of his daughters to Finn.
 "Peaceably they abode a long time with each other, and it was said that no
 man then living was richer in gold and silver, in flocks and herds, than Dermot
 O'Dyna, nor one that made more preys." [how significant is this naive
 indication that the making of foray: on his neighbours was regarded in Celtic
 Ireland as the natural and laudable occupation of a country gentleman ! Compare
 Spenser's account of the ideals fostered by the Irish bards of his time,
 "View of the Present State of Ireland," p. 641 (Globe edition).]
 Grania bears to Dermot four sons and a daughter.</p>
 
 <p>
 But Grania is not satisfied until "the
 two best men that are in Erin, namely, Cormac son of Art and Finn son of
 Cumhal," have been entertained in her house. "And how do we
 know," she adds, "but our daughter might then get a fitting
 husband?" Dermot agrees with some misgiving; the king and Finn accept the
 invitation, and they and their retinues are feasted for a year at Rath Grania.</p>
 
 <p>

 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Vengeance of Finn</p>
 
 
 <p>
 Then one night, towards the end of the year
 of feasting, Dermot is awakened from sleep by the baying of a hound. He starts
 up, "so that Grania caught him and threw her two arms about him and asked
 him what he had seen." "It is the voice of a hound," says Dermot,
 "and I marvel to hear it in the night." "Save and protect
 thee," says Grania ; "it is the Danaan Folk that are at work on thee.
 Lay thee down again." But three times the hound's voice awakens him, and on
 the morrow he goes forth armed with sword and sling, and followcd by his own
 hound, to see what is afoot.</p>
 
 <p>
 On the mountain of Ben Bulben in Sligo he
 comes across Finn with a hunting-party of the Fianna. They are not now hunting,
 however; they are being hunted; for they have roused up the enchanted boar
 without ears or tail, the Boar of Ben Bulben, which has slain thirty of them
 that morning. "And do thou come away," says Finn, knowing well that
 Dermot will never retreat from a danger ;"for thou art under <i>geise </i>not
 to hunt pig."</p>
 
 <p>
 "How is that?" says Dermot, and
 Finn then tells him the weird story of the death of the steward's son and his
 revivification in the form of this boar, with its mission of vengeance. "By
 my word," quoth Dermot, "it is to slay me that thou hast made this
 hunt, O Finn ; and if it be here that I am fated to die, I have no power now to
 shun it."</p>
 
 <p>
 The beast then appears on the face of the
 mountain, and Dermot slips the hound at him, but the hound flies in terror.
 Dermot then slings a stone which strikes the boar fairly in the middle of his
 forehead but does not even scratch his skin. The beast is close on him now, and
 Dermot strikes him with his sword, but the weapon flies in two and not a bristle
 of the boar is cut.</p>
 
 <p>
 [301]</p>
 
 <p>
 In the charge of the boar Dermot falls over
 him, and is carried for a space clinging to his back; but at last the boar
 shakes him off to the ground, and making "an<i> </i>eager, exceeding mighty
 spring" upon him, rips out his bowels, while at the same time, with the
 hilt of the sword still in his hand, Dermot dashes out the brains of the beast,
 and it falls dead beside him.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Death of Dermot</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The implacable Finn then comes up, and stands
 over Dermot in his agony. "It likes me well to see thee in that plight, O
 Dermot," he says, "and I would that all the women in Ireland saw thee
 now; for thy excellent beauty is turned to ugliness and thy choice form to
 deformity." Dermot reminds Finn of how he once rescued him from deadly
 peril when attacked during a feast at the house of Derc, and begs him to heal
 him with a draught of water from his hands, for Finn had the magic gift of
 restoring any wounded man to health with a draught of well-water drawn in his
 two hands. "Here is no well," says Finn. "That is not true,"
 says Dermot, "for nine paces from you is the best well of pure water in the
 world." Finn, at last, on the entreaty of Oscar and the Fianna, and after
 the recital of many deeds done for his sake by Dermot in old days, goes to the
 well, but ere he brings the water to Dermot's side he lets it fall through his
 fingers. A second time he goes, and a second time he lets the water fall,
 "having thought upon Grania," and Dermot gave a sigh of anguish on
 seeing it. Oscar then declares that if Finn does not bring the water promptly
 either he or Finn shall never leave the hill alive, and Finn goes once more to
 the well, but it is now too late; Dermot is dead before the healing draught can
 reach his lips. Then Finn takes the hound of Dermot, the</p>
 
 <p>
 [302]</p>
 
 <p>
 chiefs of the Fianna lay their cloaks over
 the dead man, and they return to Rath Grania. Grania, seeing the hound led by
 Finn, conjectures what has happened, and swoons upon the rampart of the Rath.
 Oisin, when she has revived, gives her the hound, against Finn's will, and the
 Fianna troop away, leaving her to her sorrow. When the people of Grania's
 household go out to fetch in the body of Dermot they find there Angus Og and his
 company of the People of Dana, who, after raising three bitter and terrible
 cries, bear away the body on a gilded bier, and Angus declares that though he
 cannot restore the dead to life, "I will send a soul into him so that he
 may talk with me each day."</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The End of Grania</p>
 
 
 <p>
 To a tale like this modern taste demands a
 romantic and sentimental ending; and such has actually been given to it in the
 retelling by Dr. P. W. Joyce in his "Old Celtic Romances," as it has
 to the tale of Deirdre by almost every modern writer who has handled it. [Dr.
 John Todhunter, in his "Three Irish Bardic Tales," has alone, I think,
 kept the antique ending of the tale of Deirdre.] But the Celtic story-teller
 felt differently. The tale of the end of Deirdre is horribly cruel, that of
 Grania cynical and mocking; neither is in the least sentimental. Grania is at
 first enraged with Finn, and sends her sons abroad to learn feats of arms, so
 that they may take vengeance upon him when the time is ripe. But Finn, wily and
 far-seeing as he is portrayed in this tale, knows how to forestall this danger.
 When the tragedy on Ben Bulben has begun to grow a little faint in the shallow
 soul of Grania, he betakes himself to her, and though met at first with scorn
 and indignation he woos her so sweetly and with such tenderness that at last he
 brings</p>
 
 <p>
 [303]</p>
 
 <p>
 her to his will, and he bears her back as a
 bride to the Hill of Allen. When the Fianna see the pair coming towards them in
 this loving guise they burst into a shout of laughter and derision, "so
 that Grania bowed her head in shame." "We trow, O Finn," cries
 Oisin, that thou wilt keep Grania well from hence-forth." So Grania made
 peace between Finn and her sons, and dwelt with Finn as his wife until he died.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 Two Streams of Fian Legends</p>
 
 
 <p>
 It will be noticed that in this legend Finn
 does not appear as a sympathetic character. Our interest is all on the side of
 Dermot. In this aspect of it the tale is typical of a certain class of Fian
 stories. Just as there were two rival clans within the Fian organisation - the
 Clan Bascna and the Clan Morna - who sometimes came to blows for the supremacy,
 so there are two streams of legends seeming to flow respectively from one or
 other or these sources, in one of which Finn is glorified, while in the other he
 is belittled in favour of Goll mac Morna or any other hero with whom he comes
 into conflict.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 End of the Fianna</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The story of the end of the Fianna is told in
 a number of pieces, some prose, some poetry, all of them, however, agreeing in
 presenting this event as a piece of sober history, without any of the
 supernatural and mystical atmosphere in which nearly all the Fian legends are
 steeped.</p>
 
 <p>
 After the death of Cormac mac Art his son
 Cairbry came to the High-Kingship of Ireland. He had a fair daughter named <i>Sgeimh
 Solais </i>(Light of Beauty), who was asked in marriage by a son of the King of
 the Decies. The marriage was arranged, and the Fianna claimed a ransom or
 tribute of twenty ingots of gold, which, it is said, was customarily paid to
 them on these occasions.</p>
 
 <p>
 [304]</p>
 
 <p>
 It would seem that the Fianna had now grown
 to be a distinct power within the State, and an oppressive one, exacting heavy
 tributes and burdensome privileges from kings and sub-kings all over Ireland.
 Cairbry resolved to break them; and he thought he had now a good opportunity to
 do so. He therefore refused payment of the ransom, and summoned all the
 provincial kings to help him against the Fianna, the main body of whom
 immediately went into rebellion for what they deemed their rights. The old feud
 between Clan Bascna and Clan Morna now broke out afresh, the latter standing by
 the High King, while Clan Bascna, aided by the King of Munster and his forces,
 who alone took their side, marched against Cairbry.</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Battle of Gowra</p>
 
 
 <p>
 All this sounds very matter-of-fact and
 probable, but how much real history there may be in it it is very hard to say.
 The decisive battle of the war which ensued took place at Gowra (Gabhra), the
 name of which survives in Garristown, Co. Dublin. The rival forces, when drawn
 up in battle array, knelt and kissed the sacred soil of Erin before they
 charged. The story of the battle iii the poetical versions, one of which is
 published in the Ossianic Society's " Transactions," and another and
 finer one in Campbell's "The Fians," ["Waifs and Strays of Celtic
 Tradition," Argyllshire Series. The tale was taken down in verse, word for
 word, from the dictation of Roderick mac Fadyen in Tiree, 1868.] is supposed to
 be related by Oisin to St. Patrick. He lays great stress on the feats of his son
 Oscar:</p>
 
 <p>
 "My son urged his course<br>
 
 Through the battalions of Tara<br>
 
 Like a hawk through a flock of birds,<br>
 
 Or a rock descending a mountain-side,"</p>
 
 <p>
 [305]</p>
 
 <i>
 </i><p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The Death of Oscar</p>
 
 
 <p>
 The fight was <i>à outrance, </i>and the
 slaughter on both sides tremendous. None but old men and boys, it is said, were
 left in Erin after that fight. The Fianna were in the end almost entirely
 exterminated, and Oscar slain. He and the King of lreland, Cairbry, met in
 single combat, and each of them slew the other. While Oscar was still breathing,
 though there was not a palm's breadth on his body without a wound, his father
 found<i> </i>him:</p>
 
 <p>
 "I found my own son lying down<br>
 
 On his left elbow, his shield by his side;<br>
 
 His right hand clutched the sword,<br>
 
 The blood poured through his mail.</p>
 
 <p>
 "Oscar gazed up at me -<br>
 
 Woe to me was that sight !<br>
 
 He stretched out his two arms to me,<br>
 
 Endeavouring to rise to meet me.</p>
 
 <p>
 "I grasped the hand of my son<br>
 
 And sat down by his left side;<br>
 
 And since I sat by him there,<br>
 
 I have recked nought of the world."</p>
 
 <p>
 When Finn (in the Scottish version) comes to
 bewail his grandson, he cries:</p>
 
 <p>
 "Woe, that it was not I who fell<br>
 
 In the fight of bare sunny Gavra,<br>
 
 And you were east and west<br>
 
 Marching before the Fians, Oscar."</p>
 
 <p>
 But Oscar replies :</p>
 
 <p>
 "Were it you that fell<br>
 
 In the fight of bare sunny Garn,<br>
 
 One sigh, east or west,<br>
 
 Would not he heard for you from Oscar.</p>
 
 <p>
 [306]</p>
 
 <p>
 No man ever knew<br>
 
 A heart of flesh was in my breast,<br>
 
 But a heart of the twisted horn<br>
 
 And a sheath of steel over it.</p>
 
 <p>
 "But the howling of dogs beside me,<br>
 
 And the wail of the old heroes,<br>
 
 And the weeping of the women by turn,<br>
 
 'Tis that vexes my heart."</p>
 
 <p>
 Oscar dies, after thanking the gods for his
 father's safety, and Oisin and Keelta raise him on a bier of spears and carry
 him off under his banner, "The Terrible Sheaf," for burial on the
 field where he died, and where a great green burial mound is still associated
 with his name. Finn takes no part in the battle. He is said to have come
 "in a ship" to view the field afterwards, and he wept over Oscar, a
 thing he had never done save once before for his hound, Bran, whom he himself
 killed by accident. Possibly the reference to the ship is an indication that he
 had by this time passed away, and came to revisit the earth from the oversea
 kingdom of Death.</p>
 
 <p>
 There is in this tale of the Battle of Gowra
 a melancholy grandeur which gives it a place apart in the Ossianic literature.
 It is a fitting dirge for a great legendary epoch. Campbell tells us that the
 Scottish crofters and shepherds were wont to put off their bonnets when they
 recited it. He adds a strange and thrilling piece of modern folk-lore bearing on
 it. Two men, it is said, were out at night, probably sheep-stealing or on some
 other predatory occupation, and telling Fian tales as they went, when they
 observed two giant and shadowy figures talking to each other across the glen.
 One of the apparitions said to the other "Do you see that man down below? I
 was the second door-post of battle on the day of Gowra, and that man there knows
 all about it better than myself."</p>
 
 <p>
 [307]</p>
 
 <p>
  </p>
 
 <b>
 </b><p>
 The End of Finn</p>
 
 
 <p>
 As to Finn himself, it is strange that in all
 the extant mass of the Ossianic literature there should be no complete narrative
 of his death. There are references to it in the poetic legends, and annalists
 even date it, but the references conflict with each other, and so do the dates.
 There is no clear light to be obtained on the subject from either annalists or
 poets. Finn seems to have melted into the magic mist which enwraps so many of
 his deeds in life. Yet a popular tradition says that he and his great
 companions, Oscar and Keelta and Oisin and the rest, never died, but lie, like
 Kaiser Barbarossa, spell-bound in an<i> </i>enchanted cave where they await the
 appointed time to reappear in glory and redeem their land from tyranny and
 wrong.</p>
