 middle of this gospel.] </p>
 
 <p>"...will, then, matter be saved or not?" </p>
 
 <p>The Savior said, "All natures, all formed things, all creatures exist in and with
 one another and will again be resolved into their own roots, because the nature of matter
 is dissolved into the roots of its nature alone. He who has ears to hear, let him
 hear." [cf. Matt. 11:15, etc.]. </p>
 
 <p>Peter said to him, "Since you have now explained all things to us, tell us this:
 what is the sin of the world?" [cf. John 1:29]. The Savior said, "Sin as such
 does not exist, but you make sin when you do what is of the nature of fornication, which
 is called 'sin.' For this reason the Good came into your midst, to the essence of each
 nature, to restore it to its root." He went on to say, "For this reason you come
 into existence and die [...] whoever knows may know [...] a suffering which has nothing
 like itself, which has arisen out of what is contrary to nature. Then there arises a
 disturbance in the whole body. For this reason I said to you, Be of good courage [cf.
 Matt. 28:9], and if you are discouraged, still take courage over against the various forms
 of nature. He who has ears to hear, let him hear." When the Blessed One said this, he
 greeted all of them, saying "Peace be with you [cf. John 14:27]. Receive my peace for
 yourselves. Take heed lest anyone lead you astray with the words, 'Lo, here!' or 'Lo,
 there!' [cf. Matt. 24:5, 23; Luke 17:21] for the Son of Man is within you [cf. Luke
 17:21]. Follow him; those who seek him will find him [cf. Matt. 7:7]. Go, therefore, and
 preach the Gospel of the Kingdom [cf. Matt. 4:23; 9:15; Mark 16:15]. I have left no
 commandment but what I have commanded you, and I have given you no law, as the lawgiver
 did, lest you be bound by it." </p>
 
 <p>They grieved and mourned greatly, saying, "How shall we go to the Gentiles and
 preach the Gospel of the Kingdom of the Son of Man? If even he was not spared, how shall
 we be spared?" </p>
 
 <p>Then Mary stood up and greeted all of them and said to her brethren, "Do not mourn
 or grieve or be irresolute, for his grace will be with you all and will defend you. Let us
 rather praise his greatness, for he prepared us and made us into men." When Mary said
 this, their hearts changed for the better, and they began to discuss the words of the
 [Savior]. </p>
 
 <p>Peter said to Mary, "Sister, we know that the Savior loved you more than other
 women [cf. John 11:5, Luke 10:38-42]. Tell us the words of the Savior which you have in
 mind since you know them; and we do not, nor have we heard of them." </p>
 
 <p>Mary answered and said, "What is hidden from you I will impart to you." And
 she began to say the following words to them. "I," she said, "I saw the
 Lord in a vision and I said to him, 'Lord, I saw you today in a vision.' He answered and
 said to me, 'Blessed are you, since you did not waver at the sight of me. For where the
 mind is, there is your countenance' [cf. Matt. 6:21]. I said to him, 'Lord, the mind which
 sees the vision, does it see it through the soul or through the spirit?' The Savior
 answered and said, 'It sees neither through the soul nor through the spirit, but the mind,
 which is between the two, which sees the vision, and it is...'" </p>
 
 <p>"...and Desire said, 'I did not see you descend; but now I see you rising. Why do
 you speak falsely, when you belong to me?' The soul answered and said, 'I saw you, but you
 did not see me or recognize me; I served you as a garment and you did not recognize me.'
 After it had said this, it went joyfully and gladly away. Again it came to the third
 power, Ignorance. This power questioned the soul: 'Whither are you going? You were bound
 in wickedness, you were bound indeed. Judge not' [cf. Matt. 7:1]. And the soul said, 'Why
 do you judge me, when I judged not? I was bound, though I did not bind. I was not
 recognized, but I recognized that all will go free, things both earthly and heavenly.'
 After the soul had left the third power behind, it rose upward, and saw the fourth power,
 which had seven forms. The first form is darkness, the second desire, the third ignorance,
 the fourth the arousing of death, the fifth is the kingdom of the flesh, the sixth is the
 wisdom of the folly of the flesh, the seventh is wrathful wisdom. These are the seven
 participants in wrath. They ask the soul, 'Whence do you come, killer of men, or where are
 you going, conqueror of space?' The soul answered and said, 'What seizes me is killed;
 what turns me about is overcome; my desire has come to an end and ignorance is dead. In a
 world I was saved from a world, and in a "type," from a higher "type"
 and from the fetter of the impotence of knowledge, the existence of which is temporal.
 From this time I will reach rest in the time of the moment of the Aeon in silence.'" </p>
 
 <p>When Mary had said this, she was silent, since the Savior had spoken thus far with her.
 But Andrew answered and said to the brethren, 'Say what you think concerning what she
 said. For I do not believe that the Savior said this. For certainly these teachings are of
 other ideas." </p>
 
 <p>Peter also opposed her in regard to these matters and asked them about the Savior.
 "Did he then speak secretly with a woman [cf. John 4:27], in preference to us, and
 not openly? Are we to turn back and all listen to her? Did he prefer her to us?" Then
 Mary grieved and said to Peter, "My brother Peter, what do you think? Do you think
 that I thought this up myself in my heart or that I am lying concerning the Savior?" </p>
 
 <p>Levi answered and said to Peter, "Peter, you are always irate. Now I see that you
 are contending against the woman like the adversaries. But if the Savior made her worthy,
 who are you to reject her? Surely the Savior knew her very well [cf. Luke 10:38- 42]. For
 this reason he loved her more than us [cf. John 11:5]. And we should rather be ashamed and
 put on the Perfect Man, to form us [?] as he commanded us, and proclaim the gospel,
 without publishing a further commandment or a further law than the one which the Savior
 spoke." When Levi had said this, they began to go out in order to proclaim him and
 preach him.</p>
