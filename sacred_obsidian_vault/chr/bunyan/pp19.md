 Section VIII.
 
 
      So they stayed there more than a month, and Mercy was given to Matthew to
 Wife.
 
 
      While they stayed here, Mercy, as her custom was, would be making Coats
 and Garments to the Poor, by which she brought up a very good report upon the
 Pilgrims.
 
 
 
 
      But to return again to our Story. After Supper the Lads desired a Bed,
 for that they were weary with travelling. Then Gaius called to shew them their
 chamber, but said Mercy, I will have them to Bed. So she had them to Bed, and
 they slept well. But the rest sat up all night, for Gaius and they were such
 suitable Company that they could not tell how to part. Then after much talk of
 their Lord, themselves, and their Journey, old Mr Honest, he that put forth
 the riddle to Gaius, began to nod. Then said Great-heart, What Sir, you
 begin to be drowsy, come, rub up, now here's a Riddle for you. Then said Mr
 Honest, Let's hear it.
 
 
      Then said Mr Great-heart:
 
 
 He that will kill, must first be overcome;
 Who live abroad would, first must die at home.
 
 
      Hah, said Mr Honest, it is a hard one, hard to expound, and harder to
 practise. But come Landlord, said he, I will if you please, leave my part to
 you, do you expound it, and I will hear what you say.
 
 
      No said Gaius, 'twas put to you, and 'tis expected that you should answer
 it.
 
 
      Then said the old Gentleman,
 
 
 He first by Grace must conquer'd be,
 That Sin would mortify;
 And who, that lives, would convince me,
 Unto himself must die.
 
 
      It is right, said Gaius, good Doctrine and Experience teaches this. For
 First, until Grace displays itself, and overcomes the soul with its Glory, it
 is altogether without heart to oppose Sin. Besides, if Sin is Satan's Cords by
 which the soul lies bound, how should it make resistance before it is loosed
 from that infirmity?
 
 
      Secondly, Nor will any that knows either Reason or Grace, believe that
 such a man can be a living Monument of Grace that is a Slave to his own
 Corruptions.
 
 
      And now it comes in my mind, I will tell you a Story worth the hearing.
 There were two men that went on Pilgrimage, the one began when he was young,
 the other when he was old. The young man had strong Corruptions to grapple
 with, the old man's were decayed with the decays of nature. The young man trod
 his steps as even as did the old one, and was every way as light as he. Who
 now, or which of them, had their Graces shining clearest, since both seemed to
 be alike?
 
 
      Hon. The young man's, doubtless. For that which heads it against the
 greatest opposition, gives best demonstration that it is strongest. Specially
 when it also holdeth pace with that that meets not with half so much, as to be
 sure old age does not.
 
 
      Besides, I have observed that old men have blessed themselves with this
 mistake, namely, taking the decays of Nature for a gracious Conquest over
 Corruptions, and so have been apt to beguile themselves. Indeed old men that
 are gracious are best able to give advice to them that are young, because they
 have seen most of the emptiness of things. But yet, for an old and a young to
 set out both together, the young one has the advantage of the fairest
 discovery of a work of Grace within him, tho the old man's Corruptions are
 naturally the weakest.
 
 
      Thus they sat talking till break of day. Now when the Family was up,
 Christiana bid her Son James that he should read a Chapter, so he read the 53d
 of Isaiah. When he had done, Mr Honest asked, why it was said that the Saviour
 is said to come out of a dry ground, and also that he had no form nor
 comeliness in him?
 
 
      Great-heart. Then said Mr Great-heart, To the First I answer, Because
 the Church of the Jews, of which Christ came, had then lost almost all the Sap
 and Spirit of Religion. To the Second I say, the words are spoken in the
 person of the Unbelievers, who because they want that Eye that can see into
 our Prince's Heart, therefore they judge of him by the meanness of his
 Outside. Just like those that know not that Precious Stones are covered over
 with a homely Crust, who when they have found one, because they know not what
 they have found, cast it again away as men do a common Stone.
 
 
      Well, said Gaius, now you are here, and since, as I know, Mr Great -
 heart is good at his Weapons, if you please, after we have refreshed
 ourselves, we will walk into the Fields to see if we can do any good. About a
 mile from hence there is one Slay-good, a Giant that doth much annoy the
 King's High-way in these parts; and I know whereabout his Haunt is. He is
 Master of a number of Thieves. 'Twould be well if we could clear these parts
 of him.
 
 
      So they consented and went, Mr Great-heart with his Sword, Helmet and
 Shield, and the rest with Spears and Staves.
 
 
      When they came to the place where he was, they found him with one Feeble
 mind in his hands, whom his Servants had brought unto him, having taken him in
 the way. Now the Giant was rifling of him, with a purpose after that to pick
 his Bones, for he was of the nature of Flesh-eaters.
 
 
      Well, so soon as he saw Mr Great-heart and his Friends at the Mouth of
 his cave with their Weapons, he demanded what they wanted?
 
 
      Great-heart. We want thee, for we are come to revenge the quarrel of
 the many that thou hast slain of the Pilgrims, when thou hast dragged them out
 of the King's High-way, wherefore come out of thy Cave. So he armed himself
 and came out, and to a Battle they went, and fought for above an hour and then
 stood still to take wind.
 
 
      Slay. Then said the Giant, Why are you here on my ground?
 
 
      Great-heart. To revenge the Blood of Pilgrims, as I also told thee
 before. So they went to it again, and the Giant made Mr Great-heart give
 back; but he came up again, and in the greatness of his mind he let fly with
 such stoutness at the Giant's head and sides, that he made him let his Weapon
 fall out of his hand. So he smote him and slew him, and cut off his Head, and
 brought it away to the Inn. He also took Feeble-mind the Pilgrim, and
 brought him with him to his Lodgings. When they were come home, they shewed
 his head to the Family, and then set it up, as they had done others before,
 for a terror to those that should attempt to do as he hereafter.
 
 
      Then they asked Mr Feeble-mind how he fell into his hands?
 
 
      Feeble-mind. Then said the poor man, I am a sickly man as you see, and,
 because Death did usually once a day knock at my door, I thought I should
 never be well at home; so I betook myself to a Pilgrim's life, and have
 travelled hither from the Town of Uncertain, where I and my Father were born.
 I am a man of no strength at all of body, nor yet of mind; but would if I
 could, tho' I can but crawl, spend my life in the Pilgrim's way. When I came
 at the Gate that is at the head of the way, the Lord of that place did
 entertain me freely, neither objected he against my weakly looks, nor against
 my feeble-mind; but gave me such things that were necessary for my Journey,
 and bid me hope to the end. When I came to the house of the Interpreter, I
 received much kindness there, and because the Hill Difficulty was judged too
 hard for me, I was carried up that by one of his servants. Indeed I have found
 much relief from Pilgrims, tho' none was willing to  o so softly as I am
 forced to do; yet still as they came on, they bid me be of good cheer, and
 said that it was the will of their Lord that comfort should be given to the
 feeble-minded, and so went on their own pace. When I was come up to Assault
 Lane, then this Giant met with me, and bid me prepare for an Encounter; but
 alas, feeble one that I was, I had more need of a Cordial. So he came up and
 took me. I conceited he should not kill me. Also when he had got me into his
 Den, since I went not with him willingly, I believed I should come out alive
 again; for I have heard that not only any Pilgrim that is taken captive by
 violent hands, if he keeps heart-whole towards his Master, is by the Laws of
 providence to die by the hand of the Enemy. Robbed I looked to be, and robbed
 to be sure I am; but I am, as you see, escaped with Life, for the which I
 thank my King as Author, and you as the Means. Other brunts I also look for,
 but this I have resolved on, to wit, to run when I can, to go when I cannot
 run, and to creep when I cannot go. As to the main, I thank him that loves me,
 I am fixed. My way is before me, my Mind is beyond the River that has no
 Bridge, tho' I am, as you see but of a feeble Mind.
 
 
      Hon. Then said old Mr Honest, Have you not some time ago been acquainted
 with one Mr Fearing a Pilgrim?
 
 
      Feeble. Acquainted with him, Yes. He came from the Town of Stupidity,
 which lieth four degrees to the northward of the City of Destruction, and as
 many off of where I was born; yet we were well acquainted, for indeed he was
 mine Uncle, my Father's Brother. He and I have been much of a temper. He was a
 little shorter than I, but yet we were much of a complexion.
 
 
      Hon. I perceive you know him, and I am apt to believe also that you were
 related one to another; for you have his whitely Look, a Cast like his with
 your eye, and your Speech is much alike.
 
 
      Feeble. Most have said so that have known us both, and besides, what I
 have read in him, I have for the most part found in myself.
 
 
      Gaius. Come Sir, said good Gaius, be of good cheer, you are welcome to me
 and to my house, and what thou hast a mind to, call for freely; and what thou
 would'st have my servants to do for thee, they will do it with a ready mind.
 
 
      Then said Mr Feeble-mind, This is unexpected Favour, and as the Sun
 shining out of a very dark Cloud. Did Giant Slay-good intend me this favour
 when he stopped me, and resolved to let me go no further? Did he intend that
 after he had rifled my Pockets, I should go to Gaius mine Host? Yet so it is.
 
 
      Now just as Mr Feeble-mind and Gaius was thus in talk, there comes one
 running and called at the door, and told, That about a mile and a half off
 there was one Mr Not-right a Pilgrim struck dead upon the place where he was
 with a Thunderbolt.
 
 
      Feeble. Alas, said Mr Feeble-mind, is he slain? He overtook me some
 days before I came so far as hither, and would be my Company-keeper. He also
 was with me when Slay-good the Giant took me, but he was nimble of his heels
 and escaped. But it seems he escaped to die, and I was took to live.
 
 
 What one would think doth seek to slay outright,
 Ofttimes delivers from the saddest plight.
 That very Providence whose face is Death,
 Doth ofttimes to the lowly Life bequeath.
 I taken was, he did escape and flee,
 Hands cross'd gives Death to him, and Life to me.
 
 
      Now about this time Matthew and Mercy were married. Also Gaius gave his
 Daughter Phebe to James, Matthew's Brother, to Wife; after which time they yet
 stayed above ten days at Gaius' house, spending their time and the seasons
 like as Pilgrims use to do.
 
 
 
 
      When they were to depart, Gaius made them a Feast, and they did eat and
 drink and were merry. Now the hour was come that they must be gone, wherefore
 Mr Great-heart called for a Reckoning. But Gaius told him that at his house
 it was not the custom for Pilgrims to pay for their Entertainment. He boarded
 them by the year, but looked for his pay from the good Samaritan, who had
 promised him at his return, whatsoever charge he was at with them faithfully
 to repay him. Then said Mr Great-heart to him,
 
 
 
 
      Great-heart. Beloved, thou dost faithfully whatsoever thou dost to the
 Brethren and to Strangers, which have borne witness of thy Charity before the
 Church; whom if thou (yet) bring forward on their Journey after a Godly sort,
 thou shalt do well.
 
 
      Then Gaius took his leave of them all, and of his Children, and
 particularly of Mr Feeble-mind. He also gave him something to drink by the
 way.
 
 
      Now Mr Feeble-mind, when they were going out to the door, made as if he
 intended to linger. The which when Mr Great-heart espied, he said, Come Mr
 Feeble-mind, pray do you go along with us, I will be your Conductor, and you
 shall fare as the rest.
 
 
      Feeble. Alas, I want a suitable Companion, you are all lusty and strong,
 but I, as you see, am weak. I chuse therefore rather to come behind, lest by
 reason of my many Infirmities I should be both a Burden to myself and to you.
 I am, as I said, a man of a weak and feeble mind, and shall be offended and
 made weak at that which others can bear. I shall like no Laughing, I shall
 like no gay Attire, I shall like no unprofitable Questions. Nay I am so weak a
 man, as to be offended with that which others have liberty to do. I do not yet
 know all the Truth. I am a very ignorant Christian man. Sometimes if I hear
 some rejoice in the Lord, it troubles me because I cannot do so too. It is
 with me as it is with a weak man among the strong, or as with a weak man among
 the strong, or as with a sick man among the healthy, or as a Lamp despised,
 (He that is ready to slip with his feet, is as a Lamp despised in the thought
 of him that is at ease.) So that I know not what to do.
 
 
      Great-heart. But Brother, said Mr Great-heart, I have it in
 Commission to comfort the feeble-minded, and to support the weak. You must
 needs go along with us; we will wait for you, we will lend you our help, we
 will deny ourselves of some things both opinionative and practical for your
 sake, we will not enter into doubtful disputations before you, we will be made
 all things to you rather than you shall be left behind.
 
 
      Now all this while they were at Gaius' door; and behold as they were
 thus in the heat of their discourse Mr Ready-to-halt came by with his
 Crutches in his hand, and he also was going on Pilgrimage.
 
 
      Feeble. Then said Mr Feeble-mind to him, Man, how camest thou hither? I
 was but just now complaining that I had not a suitable Companion, but thou art
 according to my wish. Welcome, welcome, good Mr Ready-to-halt, I hope thee
 and I may be some help.
 
 
      Ready-to-halt. I shall be glad of thy Company, said the other; and
 good Mr Feeble-mind, rather than we will part, since we are thus happily
 met, I will lend thee one of my Crutches.
 
 
      Feeble. Nay, said he, tho' I thank thee for thy goodwill, I am not
 inclined to halt before I am lame. Howbeit, I think when occasion is, it may
 help me against a Dog.
 
 
      Ready. If either myself or my Crutches can do thee a pleasure, we are
 both at thy command, good Mr Feeble-mind.
 
 
      Thus therefore they went on, Mr Great-heart and Mr Honest went before,
 Christiana and her Children went next, and Mr Feeble-mind and Mr Ready-to
 - halt came behind with his Crutches. Then said Mr Honest,
 
 
      Hon. Pray Sir, now we are upon the Road, tell us some profitable things
 of some that have gone on Pilgrimage before us.
 
 
      Great-heart. With a good will. I suppose you have heard how Christian
 of old did meet with Apollyon in the Valley of Humiliation, and also what hard
 work he had to go through the Valley of the Shadow of Death. Also I think you
 cannot but have heard how Faithful was put to it with Madam Wanton, with Adam
 the First, with one Discontent, and Shame, four as deceitful Villains as a man
 can meet with upon the road.
 
 
      Hon. Yes, I have heard of all this; but indeed good Faithful was hardest
 put to it with Shame, he was an unwearied one.
 
 
      Great-heart. Ay, for as the Pilgrim well said, he of all men had the
 wrong name.
 
 
      Hon. But pray Sir, where was it that Christian and Faithful met
 Talkative? That same was also a notable one.
 
 
      Great-heart. He was a confident Fool, yet many follow his ways.
 
 
      Hon. He had like to a beguiled Faithful.
 
 
      Great-heart. Ay, but Christian put him into a way quickly to find him
 out. Thus they went on till they came at the place where Evangelist met with
 Christian and Faithful, and prophesied to them of what should befall them at
 Vanity Fair.
 
 
      Great-heart. Then said their Guide, Hereabouts did Christian and
 Faithful meet with Evangelist, who prophesied to them of what Troubles they
 should meet with at Vanity Fair.
 
 
      Hon. Say you so? I dare say it was a hard Chapter that then he did read
 unto them.
 
 
      Great-heart. 'Twas so; but he gave them encouragement withal. But what
 do we talk of them? they were a couple of lion-like men, they had set their
 faces like flint. Don't you remember how undaunted they were when they stood
 before the Judge?
 
 
      Hon. Well, Faithful bravely suffered.
 
 
      Great-heart. So he did, and as brave things came on't, for Hopeful and
 some others, as the Story relates it, were converted by his Death.
 
 
      Hon. Well, but pray go on, for you are well acquainted with things.
 
 
      Great-heart. Above all that Christian met with after he had passed
 through Vanity Fair, one By-ends was the arch one.
 
 
      Hon. By-ends, What was he?
 
 
      Great-heart. A very arch Fellow, a downright Hypocrite. One that would
 be religious which way ever the World went, but so cunning that he would be
 sure neither to lose nor suffer for it. He had his mode of Religion for every
 fresh occasion, and his Wife was as good at it as he. He would turn and change
 from opinion to opinion, yea, and plead for so doing too. But so far as I
 could learn, he came to an ill end with his by-ends, nor did I ever hear
 that any of his Children were ever of any esteem with any that truly feared
 God.
 
 
      Now by this time they were come within sight of the Town of Vanity where
 Vanity Fair is kept. So when they saw that they were so near the Town, they
 consulted with one another how they should pass through the Town, and some
 said one thing and some another. At last Mr Great-heart said, I have, as you
 may understand, often been a Conductor of Pilgrims through this Town, now I am
 acquainted with one Mr Mnason, a Cyprusian by Nation, an old Disciple, at
 whose house we may lodge. If you think good, said he, we will turn in there.
 
 
      Content, said old Honest, Content, said Christiana, Content said Mr
 Feeble-mind, and so they said all. Now you must think it was eventide by
 that they got to the outside of the Town, but Mr Great-heart knew the way to
 the old man's house. So thither they came; and he called at the door, and the
 old man within knew his tongue so soon as ever he heard it; so he opened, and
 they all came in. Then said Mnason their Host, How far have ye come to-day?
 so they said, From the house of Gaius our Friend. I promise you, said he, you
 have gone a good stitch, you may well be a weary, sit down. So they sat down.
 
 
      Great-heart. Then said their Guide, Come, what cheer Sirs? I dare say
 you are welcome to my Friend.
 
 
      Mnason. I also, said Mr Mnason, do bid you welcome, and whatever you
 want, do but say, and we will do what we can to get it for you.
 
 
      Hon. Our great want a while since was Harbour and good Company, and now I
 hope we have both.
 
 
      Mnason. For Harbour, you see what it is, but for good Company, that will
 appear in the trial.
 
 
      Great-heart. Well, said Mr Great-heart, will you have the Pilgrims up
 into their Lodging?
 
 
      Mnason. I will, said Mr Mnason. So he had them to their respective
 places; and also shewed them a very fair Dining-room, where they might be
 and sup together, until time was come to go to Rest.
 
 
      Now when they were set in their places, and were a little cheery after
 their Journey, Mr Honest asked his Landlord if there were any store of good
 people in the Town?
 
 
      Mnason. We have a few, for indeed they are but a few when compared with
 them on the other side.
 
 
      Hon. But how shall we do to see some of them? for the sight of good men
 to them that are going on Pilgrimage, is like to the appearing of the Moon and
 the Stars to them that are sailing upon the Seas.
 
 
      Then Mr Mnason stamped with his foot, and his daughter Grace came up; so
 he said unto her, Grace, go you tell my Friends, Mr Contrite, Mr Holy-man,
 Mr Love-saint, Mr Dare-not-lye, and Mr Penitent, that I have a Friend or
 two at my house that have a mind this evening to see them.
 
 
      So Grace went to call them, and they came and after Salutation made, they
 sat down together at the Table.
 
 
      Then said Mr Mnason their Landlord, My Neighbors, I have, as you see, a
 Company of Strangers come to my house, they are Pilgrims, they come from afar,
 and are going to Mount Sion. But who, quoth he, do you think this is, pointing
 with his finger to Christiana, it is Christiana the Wife of Christian that
 famous Pilgrim, who with Faithful his Brother were so shamefully handled in
 our Town. At that they stood amazed, saying, We little thought to see
 Christiana, when Grace came to call us, wherefore this is a very comfortable
 surprise. Then they asked her of her welfare, and if these young men were her
 Husband's Sons? And when she had told them they were, they said, The King whom
 you love and serve, make you as your Father, and bring you where he is in
 Peace.
 
 
      Hon. Then Mr Honest (when they were all sat down) asked Mr Contrite and
 the rest in what posture their Town was at present?
 
 
      Contrite. You may be sure we are full of hurry in Fair-time. 'Tis hard
 keeping our hearts and spirits in any good order, when we are in a cumbered
 condition. He that lives in such a place as this is, and that has to do with
 such as we have, has need of an Item, to caution him to take heed every moment
 of the day.
 
 
      Hon. But how are your Neighbors for quietness?
 
 
      Contrite. They are much more moderate now than formerly. You know how
 Christian and Faithful were used at our Town; but of late, I say, they have
 been far more moderate. I think the blood of Faithful lieth with load upon
 them till now, for since they burned him they have been ashamed to burn any
 more. In those days we were afraid to walk the Streets, but now we can shew
 our heads. Then the name of a Professor was odious, now, specially in some
 parts of our Town (for you know our Town is large) Religion is counted
 honourable.
 
 
      Then said Mr Contrite to them, Pray how fareth it with you in your
 Pilgrimage? How stands the Country affected towards you?
 
 
      Hon. It happens to us as it happeneth to Wayfaring men; sometimes our way
 is clean, sometimes foul, sometimes up hill, sometimes down hill. We are
 seldom at a certainty, the Wind is not always on our backs, nor is every one a
 Friend that we meet with in the way. We have met with some notable Rubs
 already, and what are yet behind we know not, but for the most part we find it
 true that has been talked of cold, A good man must suffer Trouble.
 
 
      Contrite. You talk of Rubs, what Rubs have you met withal?
 
 
      Hon. Nay, ask Mr Great-heart our Guide, for he can give the best
 account of that.
 
 
      Great-heart. We have been beset three or four times already. First
 Christiana and her Children were beset with two Ruffians, that they feared
 would a took away their lives. We was beset with Giant Bloody-man, Giant
 Maul and Giant Slay-good. Indeed we did rather beset the last, than were
 beset of him. And thus it was: After we had been some time at the house of
 Gaius, mine Host and of the whole Church, we were minded upon a time to take
 our Weapons with us, and so go see if we could light upon any of those that
 were Enemies to Pilgrims, (for we heard that there was a notable one
 thereabouts). Now Gaius knew his Haunt better than I, because he dwelt
 thereabout, so we looked and looked till at last we discerned the Mouth of his
 Cave, then we were glad and plucked up our Spirits. So we approached up to his
 Den, and lo when we came there, he had dragged by mere force into his Net this
 poor Man Mr Feeble-mind, and was about to bring him to his end. But when he
 saw us, supposing as we thought he had had another Prey, he left the poor man
 in his Hole, and came out. So we fell to it full sore, and he lustily laid
 about him; but in conclusion he was brought down to the ground, and his Head
 cut off, and set up by the Way-side for a terror to such as should after
 practise such Ungodliness. That I tell you the truth, here is the man himself
 to affirm it, who was as a Lamb taken out of the Mouth of the Lion.
 
 
      Feeble-mind. Then said Mr Feeble-mind, I found this true to my Cost
 and Comfort, to my Cost when he threatened to pick my Bones every moment, and
 to my Comfort when I saw Mr Great-heart and his Friends with their Weapons
 approach so near for my Deliverance.
 
 
      Holy-man. Then said Mr Holy-man, There are two things that they have
 need to be possessed with that go on Pilgrimage, courage, and an unspotted
 life. If they have not courage, they can never hold on their way, and if their
 Lives be loose, they will make the very name of a Pilgrim stink.
 
 
      Love-saint. Then said Mr Love-saint, I hope this caution is not
 needful amongst you. But truly there are many that go upon the road, that
 rather declare themselves Strangers to Pilgrimage than Strangers and Pilgrims
 in the Earth.
 
 
      Dare-not-lye. Then said Mr Dare-not-lye, "Tis true, they neither
 have the Pilgrim's Weed, nor the Pilgrim's Courage; they go not uprightly, but
 all awry with their feet; one Shoe goes inward, another outward, and their
 Hosen out behind; there a Rag, and there a Rent, to the Disparagement of their
 Lord.
 
 
      Penitent. These things, said Mr Penitent, they ought to be troubled for,
 nor are the Pilgrims like to have that Grace put upon them and their Pilgrim's
 Progress as they desire, until the way is cleared of such Spots and Blemishes.
 
 
      Thus they sat talking and spending the time, until Supper was set upon
 the Table; unto which they went and refreshed their weary bodies; so they went
 to Rest. Now they stayed in this Fair a great while at the house of this Mr
 Mnason, who in process of time gave his daughter Grace unto Samuel
 Christiana's Son to Wife, and his Daughter Martha to Joseph.
 
 
      The time as I said, that they lay here was long, (for it was not now as
 in former times). Wherefore the Pilgrims grew acquainted with many of the good
 people of the Town, and did them what service they could. Mercy, as she was
 wont, laboured much for the Poor, wherefore their Bellies and Backs blessed
 her, and she was there an Ornament to her Profession. And to say the truth for
 Grace Phebe and Martha, they were all of a very good Nature, and did much good
 in their place. They were also all of them very Fruitful, so that Christian's
 name, as was said before, was like to live in the World.
 
 
      While they lay here, there came a Monster out of the Woods, and slew many
 of the people of the Town. It would also carry away their Children, and teach
 them to suck its Whelps. Now no man in the Town durst so much as face this
 Monster, but all men fled when they heard of the Noise of his coming.
 
 
      The Monster was like unto no one Beast upon the earth; its Body was like
 the Dragon, and it had seven Heads and ten Horns. It made great havock of
 Children, and yet it was governed by a Woman. This Monster propounded
 Conditions to men, and such men as loved their Lives more than their Souls,
 accepted of those Conditions. So they came under.
