 Section IX.
 
 
      Now this Mr Great-heart, together with these that came to visit the
 Pilgrims at Mr Mnason's house, entered into a Covenant to go and engage this
 Beast, if perhaps they might deliver the people of this Town from the Paws and
 Mouth of this so devouring a Serpent.
 
 
      Then did Mr Great-heart, Mr Contrite, Mr Holy-man, Mr Dare-not -
 lye, and Mr Penitent, with their Weapons go forth to meet him. Now the Monster
 at first was very rampant, and looked upon these Enemies with great Disdain,
 but they so belaboured him, being sturdy men at Arms, that they made him make
 a Retreat. So they came home to Mr Mnason's house again.
 
 
      The monster, you must know, had his certain Seasons to come out in, and
 to make his Attempts upon the Children of the people of the Town; also these
 Seasons did these valiant Worthies watch him in, and did still continually
 assault him; insomuch that in process of time he became not only wounded but
 lame, also he has not made that havock of the Towns-men's Children as
 formerly he has done. And it is verily believed by some, that this Beast will
 die of his Wounds.
 
 
      This therefore made Mr Great-heart and his Fellows of great Fame in
 this Town, so that many of the people that wanted their taste of things, yet
 had a reverend Esteem and Respect for them. Upon this account therefore it was
 that these Pilgrims got not much hurt here. True there were some of the baser
 sort, that could see no more than a Mole, nor understand more than a Beast,
 these had no reverence for these men, nor took they notice of their Valour or
 Adventures.
 
 
      Well the time grew on that the Pilgrims must go on their way, wherefore
 they prepared for their Journey. They sent for their Friends, they conferred
 with them, they had some time set apart therein to commit each other to the
 Protection of their Prince. There was again that brought them of such things
 as they had, that was fit for the Weak and the Strong, for the Women and the
 Men, and so laded them with such things as was necessary.
 
 
      Then they set forwards on their way, and their Friends accompanying them
 so far as was convenient, they again committed each other to the Protection of
 their King, and parted.
 
 
      They therefore that were of the Pilgrims' Company went on, and Mr Great -
 heart went before them. Now the Women and Children being weakly, they were
 forced to go as they could bear; by this means Mr Ready-to-halt and Mr
 Feeble-mind had more to sympathize with their Condition.
 
 
      When they were gone from the Towns-men, and when their Friends had bid
 them farewell they quickly came to the place where Faithful was put to Death.
 There therefore they made a stand, and thanked Him that had enabled him to
 bear his Cross so well, and the rather because they now found that they had a
 benefit by such a manly Suffering as his was.
 
 
      They went on therefore after this a good way further, talking of
 Christian and Faithful, and how Hopeful joined himself to Christian after that
 Faithful was dead.
 
 
      Now they were come up with the Hill Lucre, where the Silver-mine was,
 which took Demas off from his Pilgrimage, and into which, as some think, By -
 ends fell and perished; wherefore they considered that. But when they were
 come to the old Monument that stood over against the Hill Lucre, to wit, to
 the Pillar of Salt that stood also within view of Sodom and its stinking Lake,
 they marvelled, as did Christian before, that men of that Knowledge and
 ripeness of Wit as they was, should be so blinded as to turn aside here. Only
 they considered again that Nature is not affected with the Harms that others
 have met with, especially if that thing upon which they look has an attracting
 vertue upon the foolish eye.
 
 
      I saw now that they went on till they came at the River that was on this
 side of the Delectable Mountains. To the River where the fine Trees grow on
 both sides, and whose Leaves, if taken inwardly, are good against Surfeits,
 where the Meadows are green all the year long, and where they might lie down
 safely.
 
 
      By this River side in the Meadow there were Cotes and Folds for Sheep, an
 House built for the nourishing and bringing up of those Lambs, the Babes of
 those Women that go on Pilgrimage. Also there was here one that was intrusted
 with them who could have Compassion, and that could gather these Lambs with
 his Arm carry them in his Bosom, and that could gently lead those that were
 with young. Now to the care of this Man, Christiana admonished her four
 Daughters to rommit their little ones, that by these Waters they might be
 housed, harboured, suckered, and nourished, and that none of them might be
 lacking in time to come. This Man, if any of them go astray or be lost, he
 will bring them again: he will also bind up that which was broken, and will
 strengthen them that are sick. Here they will never want Meat and Drink and
 Cloathing, here they will be kept from Thieves and Robbers, for this Man will
 die before one of those committed to his trust shall be lost. Besides, here
 they shall be sure to have good Nurture and Admonition, and shall be taught to
 walk in right paths, and that you know is a Favour of no small account. Also
 here, as you see, are delicate Waters, pleasant Meadows, dainty Flowers,
 variety of Trees, and such as bear wholesome Fruit, Fruit not like that
 Matthew eat of, that fell over the Wall out of Beelzebub's Garden, but Fruit
 that procureth Health where there is none, and that continueth and increaseth
 it where it is.
 
 
      So they were content to commit their little ones to him; and that which
 was also an encouragement to them so to do, was, for that all this was to be
 at the Charge of the King, and so was as an Hospital for young Children and
 Orphans.
 
 
      Now they went on; and when they were come to By-path Meadow, to the
 Stile over which Christian went with his Fellow Hopeful, when they were taken
 by Giant Despair and put into Doubting Castle, they sat down and consulted
 what was best to be done; to wit, now they were so strong, and had got such a
 man as Mr Great-heart for their Conductor, whether they had not best make an
 attempt upon the Giant, demolish his Castle, and if they were any Pilgrims in
 it, to set them at liberty before they went any further. So one said one
 thing, and another said the contrary. One questioned if it was lawful to go
 upon unconsecrated ground, another said they might provided their end was
 good, but Mr Great-heart said, Though that Assertion offered last cannot be
 universally true, yet I have a Commandment of resist Sin, to overcome Evil, to
 fight the good Fight of Faith, and I pray, with whom should I fight this good
 Fight, if not with Giant Despair? I will therefore attempt the taking away of
 his Life, and the demolishing of doubting Castle. Then said he, who will go
 with me? Then said old Honest, I will. And so will we too, said Christiana's
 four Sons, Matthew Samuel James and Joseph, for they were young men and
 strong. So they left the Women in the Road, and with them Mr Feeblemind and Mr
 Ready-to-halt with his Crutches to be their guard, until they came back;
 for in that place, tho' Giant Despair dwelt so near, they keeping in the Road,
 a little Child might lead them.
 
 
      So Mr Great-heart, old Honest and the four young men went to go up to
 Doubting Castle to look for Giant Despair. When they came at the Catle-gate,
 they knocked for entrance with an unusual Noise. At that the old Giant comes
 to the Gate, and Diffidence his Wife follows. Then said he, Who and what is he
 that is so hardy as after this manner to molest the Giant Despair? Mr Great -
 heart replied, It is I, Great-heart, one of the King of the Coelestial
 Country's Conductors of Pilgrims to their place, and I demand of thee that
 thou open thy Gates for my Entrance. Prepare thyself also to fight, for I am
 come to take away thy Head, and to demolish Doubting Castle.
 
 
      Now Giant Despair, because he was a Giant, thought no man could overcome
 him; and again, thought he, since heretofore I have made a Conquest of Angels,
 shall Great-heart make me afraid? So he harnessed himself and went out. He
 had a Cap of Steel upon his Head, a Breast-plate of Fire girded to him, and
 he came out in Iron Shoes, with a great Club in his Hand. Then these six men
 made up to him, and beset him behind and before. Also when Diffidence the
 Giantess came up to help him, old Mr Honest cut her down at one Blow. Then
 they fought for their Lives, and Giant Despair was brought down to the Ground,
 but was very loth to die. He struggled hard, and had, as they say, as many
 Lives as a Cat, but Great-heart was his Death, for he left him not till he
 had severed his Head from his Shoulders.
 
 
      Then they fell to demolishing Doubting Castle, and that you know might
 with ease be done since Giant Despair was dead. They were seven days in
 destroying of that; and in it of Pilgrims they found one Mr Dispondency,
 almost starved to Death, and one Much-afraid his Daughter; these two they
 saved alive. But it would a made you a wondered to have seen the dead Bodies
 that lay here and there in the Castle-yard, and how full of dead men's Bones
 the Dungeon was.
 
 
      When Mr Great-heart and his Companions had performed this exploit, they
 took Mr Dispondency and his Daughter Much-afraid into their protection, for
 they were honest people tho' they were Prisoners in Doubting Castle to that
 Tyrant Giant Despair. They therefore I say, took with them the Head of the
 Giant (for his Body they had buried under a heap of Stones) and down to the
 Road and to their Companions they came, and shewed them what they had done.
 Now when Feeble-mind and Ready-to-halt saw that it was the Head of Giant
 Despair indeed, they were very jocund and merry. Now Christiana, if need was,
 could play upon the Vial, and her Daughter Mercy upon the Lute; so since they
 were so merry disposed, she played them a Lesson, and Ready-to-halt would
 dance. So he took Dispondency's Daughter named Much-afraid by the hand, and
 to dancing they went in the Road. True he could not dance without one Crutch
 in his hand, but I promise you he footed it well. Also the Girl was to be
 commended, for she answered the Musick handsomely.
 
 
      As for Me Dispondency, the Musick was not much to him, he was for feeding
 rather than dancing, for that he was almost starved. So Christiana gave him
 some of her Bottle of Spirits for present relief, and then prepared him
 something to eat; and in little time the old Gentleman came to himself, and
 began to be finely revived.
 
 
      Now I saw in my Dream, when all these things were finished, Mr Great -
 heart took the Head of Giant Despair, and set it upon a Pole by the High-way
 side, right over against the Pillar that Christian erected for a Caution to
 Pilgrims that came after, to take heed of entering into his grounds.
 
 
 Though Doubting Castle be demolished,
 And the Giant Despair hath lost his Head,
 Sin can rebuild the Castle, make't remain,
 And make Despair the Giant live again.
 
 
      Then he writ under it upon a Marble-stone these verses following:
 
 
 This is the Head of him, whose Name only
 In former times did Pilgrims terrify.
 His Castle's down, and Diffidence his Wife
 Brave Master Great-heart has bereft of Life.
 Dispondency, his Daughter Much-afraid,
 Great-heart for them also the Man has play'd.
 Who hereof doubts, if he'll but cast his eye
 Up hither, may his scruples satisfy:
 This Head also, when doubting Cripples dance,
 Doth shew from Fears they have Deliverance.
 
 
      When these men had thus bravely shewed themselves against Doubting
 Castle, and had slain Giant Despair, they went forward, and went on till they
 came to the Delectable Mountains, where Christian and Hopeful refreshed
 themselves with the varieties of the place. They also acquainted themselves
 with the Shepherds there, who welcomed them, as they had done Christian
 before, unto the Delectable Mountains.
 
 
      Now the Shepherds seeing so great a Train follow Mr Great-heart, (for
 with him they were well acquainted) they said unto him, Good Sir, you have got
 a goodly Company here, pray where did you find all these?
 
 
      Then Mr Great-heart replied,
 
 
 First here is Christiana and her Train,
 Her Sons, and her Sons' Wives, who like the Wain,
 Keep by the Pole, and do by Compass steer
 From Sin to Grace, else they had not been here;
 Next here's old Honest come on Pilgrimage,
 Ready-to-halt too, who I dare engage
 True-hearted is, and so is Feeble-mind,
 Who willing was not to be left behind;
 Dispondency, good man, is coming after,
 And so also is Much-afraid his Daughter.
 May we have entertainment here, or must
 We further go? Let's know whereon to trust.
 
 
      Then said the Shepherds, This is a comfortable Company. You are welcome
 to us, for we have comfort for the feeble as for the strong. Our Prince has an
 eye to what is done to the least of these, therefore Infirmity must not be a
 block to our Entertainment. So they had them to the Palace door, and then said
 unto them, Come in Mr Feeble-mind, Come in Mr Ready-to-halt, Come in Mr
 Dispondency, and Mrs Much-afraid his Daughter. These, Mr Great-heart, said
 the Shepherds to the Guide, we call in by name, for that they are most subject
 to draw back, but as for you and the rest that are strong, we leave you to
 your wonted Liberty. Then said Mr Great-heart, This day I see that Grace
 doth shine in your Faces, and that you are my Lord's Shepherds indeed; for
 that you have not pushed these diseased neither with Side nor Shoulder, but
 have rather strewed their way into the Palace with Flowers, as you should.
 
 
      So the feeble and weak went in, and Mr Great-heart and the rest did
 follow. When they were also set down, the Shepherds said to those of the
 weakest sort, What is it that you would have? for, said they, all things must
 be managed here to the supporting of the weak, as well as the warning of the
 unruly.
 
 
      So they made them a Feast of things easy of Digestion, and that were
 pleasant to the Palate, and nourishing; the which when they had received, they
 went to the Rest, each one respectively unto his proper place. When Morning
 was come, because the Mountains were high, and the day clear, and because it
 was the custom of the Shepherds to shew to the Pilgrims before their
 departure, some Rarities; therefore after they were ready, and had refreshed
 themselves, the Shepherds took them out into the Fields, and shewed them first
 what they had shewed to Christian before.
 
 
      Then they had them to some new places. The first was to Mount Marvel,
 where they looked, and beheld a man at a distance, that tumbled the Hills
 about with Words. Then they asked the Shepherds what that should mean? So they
 told them, that that man was the Son of one Great-grace, of whom you read in
 the First Part of the Records of the Pilgrim's Progress. And he is set there
 to teach Pilgrims how to believe down or to tumble out of their ways what
 Difficulties they shall meet with, by Faith. The said Mr Great-heart, I know
 him, he is a man above many.
 
 
      Then they had them to another place called Mount Innocent, and there they
 saw a man cloathed all in White, and two men Prejudice and Ill-will
 continually casting Dirt upon him. Now behold the Dirt whatsoever they cast at
 him would in a little time fall off again, and his Garment would look as clear
 as if no Dirt had been cast thereat.
 
 
      Then said the Pilgrims, What means this? The Shepherds answered, This man
 is named Godly-man, and this Garment is to shew the Innocency of his life.
 Now those that throw Dirt at him, are such as hate his well-doing, but as
 you see the Dirt will not stick upon his Cloaths, so it shall be with him that
 liveth truly innocently in the World. Whoever they be that would make such men
 dirty, they labour all in vain; for God, by that a little time is spent, will
 cause that their Innocence shall break forth as the Light, and their
 Righteousness as the Noonday.
 
 
      Then they took them, and had them to Mount Charity, where they shewed
 them a man that had a bundle of cloth lying before him, out of which he cut
 Coats and Garments for the Poor that stood about him; yet his Bundle or Roll
 of Cloth was never the less.
 
 
      Then said they, What should this be? This is, said the Shepherds, to shew
 you, that he that has a heart to give of his Labour to the Poor, shall never
 want where-withal. He that watereth shall be watered himself. And the Cake
 that the Widow gave to the Prophet did not cause that she had ever the less in
 her Barrel.
 
 
      They had them also to a place where they saw one Fool and one Want-wit
 washing of an Ethiopian with intention to make him white, but the more they
 washed him the blacker he was. They then asked the Shepherds what that should
 mean. So they told them, saying, Thus shall it be with the vile person. All
 means used to get such an one a good name shall in conclusion tend but to make
 him more abominable. Thus it was with the Pharisees, and so shall it be with
 all Hypocrites.
 
 
      Then said Mercy the Wife of Matthew to Christiana her Mother, Mother, I
 would, if it might be, see the Hole in the Hill, or that commonly called the
 By-way to Hell. So her Mother brake her mind to the Shepherds. Then they
 went to the Door. It was in the side of a Hill, and they opened it, and Bid
 Mercy hearken awhile. So she hearkened, and heard one saying, Cursed be my
 Father for holding of my feet back from the way of Peace and Life; and another
 said, O that I had been torn in pieces before I had, to save my Life, lost my
 Soul; and another said, If I were to live again, how would I deny myself,
 rather than come to this place. Then there was as if the very Earth had
 groaned and quaked under the feet of this young Woman for fear. So she looked
 white, and came trembling away, saying Blessed be he and she that is delivered
 from this place.
 
 
      Now when the Shepherds had shewed them all these things, then they had
 them back to the Palace, and entertained them with what the house would
 afford. But Mercy being a young and breeding Woman, longed for something that
 she saw there, but was ashamed to ask. Her Mother-in-law then asked her
 what she ailed, for she looked as one not well. Then said Mercy, There is a
 looking-glass hangs up in the Dining-room, off of which I can not take my
 mind, if therefore I have it not, I think I shall miscarry. Then said her
 Mother, I will mention thy wants to the Shepherds, and they will not deny it
 thee. But she said, I am ashamed that these men should know that I longed. Nay
 my Daughter, said she, it is no Shame, but a Vertue, to long for such a thing
 as that. So Mercy said, Then Mother, if you please, ask the Shepherds if they
 are willing to sell it.
 
 
      Now the Glass was one of a thousand. It would present a man, one way,
 with his own Feature exactly, and, turn it but another way, and it would shew
 one the very Face and Similitude of the Prince of Pilgrims himself. Yea I have
 talked with them that can tell, and they have said that they have seen the
 very Crown of Thorns upon his Head, by looking in that Glass, they have
 therein also seen the Holes in his Hands, in his Feet, and his Side. Yea such
 an excellency is there in that Glass, that it will shew him to one where they
 have a mind to see him, whether living or dead, whether in Earth or Heaven,
 whether in a state of Humiliation or in his Exaltation, whether coming to
 Suffer or coming to Reign.
 
 
      Christiana therefore went to the Shepherds apart (now the names of the
 Shepherds are Knowledge, Experience, Watchful, and Sincere) and said unto
 them, There is one of my Daughters, a breeding Woman, that I think doth long
 for something she hath seen in this house, and she thinks she shall miscarry
 if she should by you be denied.
 
 
      Experience. Call her, call her, she shall assuredly have what we can help
 her to. So they called her, and said to her, Mercy, what is that thing thou
 wouldest have? Then she blushed, and said, The great Glass that hangs up in
 the Dining-room. So Sincere ran and fetched it, and with a joyful consent it
 was given her. Then she bowed her head, and gave thanks, and said, By this I
 know that I have obtained favour in your eyes.
 
 
      They also gave to the other young Women such things as they desired, and
 to their Husbands great Commendations for that they joined with Mr Great -
 heart to the slaying of Giant Despair and the demolishing of Doubting Castle.
 
 
      About Christiana's Neck the Shepherds put a Bracelet, and so they did
 about the Necks of her four Daughters, also they put Ear-rings in their
 Ears, and Jewels on their Fore-heads.
 
 
      When they were minded to go hence, they let them go in peace, but gave
 not to them those certain Cautions which before were given to Christian and
 his Companion. The reason was for that these had Great-heart to be their
 Guide, who was one that was well acquainted with things, and so could give
 them their Cautions more seasonably, to wit, even then when the Danger was
 nigh the approaching.
 
 
      What Cautions Christian and his Companions had received of the Shepherds,
 they had also lost by that the time was come that they had need to put them in
 practice. Wherefore here was the advantage that this Company had over the
 other.
 
 
      From hence they went on singing, and they said,
 
 
 Behold, how fitly are the stages set
 For their Relief that Pilgrims are become;
 And how they us receive without one let,
 That make the other life our mark and home!
 What Novelties they have to us they give,
 That we, tho' Pilgrims, joyful lives may live;
 They do upon us too such things bestow,
 That shew we Pilgrims are where'er we go.
 
 
      When they were gone from the Shepherds, they quickly came to the place
 where Christian met with one Turn-away, that dwelt in the town of Apostacy.
 Wherefore of him Mr Great-heart their Guide did now put them in mind,
 saying, This is the place where Christian met with one Turn-away, who
 carried with him the character of his Rebellion at his back. And this I have
 to say concerning this man, he would hearken to no counsel, but once a
 falling, persuasion could not stop him.
 
 
      When he came to the place where the Cross and the Sepulchre was, he did
 meet with one that did bid him look there; but he gnashed with his teeth, and
 stamped, and said he was resolved to go back to his own Town. Before he came
 to the Gate, he met with Evangelist, who offered to lay hands on him to turn
 him into the way again. But this Turn-away resisted him, and having done
 much despite unto him, he got away over the Wall, and so escaped his hand.
