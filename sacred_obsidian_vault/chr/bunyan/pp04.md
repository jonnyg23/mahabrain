 Section IV.
 
 
      So in the morning they all got up, and after some more discourse, they
 told him that he should not depart till they had shewed him the Rarities of
 that place. And first they had him into the Study, where they shewed him
 Records of the greatest antiquity; in which, as I remember my Dream, they
 shewed him first the Pedigree of the Lord of the Hill, that he was the Son of
 the Antient of Days, and came by an Eternal Generation. Here also was more
 fully recorded the Acts that he had done, and the names of man hundreds that
 he had taken into his service; and how he had placed them in such Habitations
 that could neither by length of Days, nor decays of Nature, be dissolved.
 
 
      Then they read to him some of the worthy Acts that some of his servants
 had done: as, how they had subdued Kingdoms, wrought Righteousness, obtained
 Promises, stopped the mouths of Lions, quenched the violence of Fire, escaped
 the edge of the Sword; out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in
 fight, and turned to flight the Armies of the Aliens.
 
 
      Then they read again in another part of the Records of the house, where
 it was shewed how willing their Lord was to receive into his favour any, even
 any, though they in time past had offered great affronts to his Person and
 proceedings. Here also were several other Histories of many other famous
 things, of all which Christian had a view; as of things both Antient and
 Modern: together with Prophecies and Predictions of things that have their
 certain accomplishment, both to the dread and amazement of Enemies, and the
 comfort and solace of Pilgrims.
 
 
      The next day they took him and had him into the Armory, where they shewed
 him all manner of Furniture, which their Lord had provided for Pilgrims, as
 Sword, Shield, Helmet, Breastplate, All-prayer, and Shoes that would not
 wear out. And there was here enough of this to harness out as many men for the
 service of their Lord as there be Stars in the Heaven for multitude.
 
 
      They also shewed him some of the Engines with which some of his Servants
 had done wonderful things. They shewed him Moses' Rod; the Hammer and Nail
 with which Jael slew Sisera; the Pitchers, Trumpets and Lamps too, with which
 Gideon put to flight the Armies of Midian: Then they shewed him the Ox's goad
 wherewith Shamgar slew six hundred men: They shewed him also the Jaw-bone
 with which Samson did such mighty feats: They shewed him moreover the Sling
 and Stone with which David slew Goliah of Gath; and the Sword also with which
 their Lord will kill the Man of Sin, in the day that he shall rise up to the
 prey. They shewed him besides many excellent things, with which Christian was
 much delighted. This done, they went to their rest again.
 
 
      Then I saw in my Dream, that on the morrow he got up to go forwards, but
 they desired him to stay till the next day also; and then, said they, we will
 (if the day be clear) shew you the Delectable Mountains, which, they said,
 would yet further add to his comfort, because they were nearer the desired
 Haven than the place where at present he was: so he consented and stayed. When
 the morning was up, they had him to the top of the House, and bid him look
 South; so he did: and behold at a great distance he saw a most pleasant
 Mountainous Country, beautified with Woods, Vineyards, Fruits of all sorts,
 Flowers also, with Springs and Fountains, very delectable to behold. Then he
 asked the name of the Country:
 
 
      They said it was Immanuel's Land; and it is as common, they said, as this
 Hill is, to and for all the Pilgrims. And when thou comest there, from thence,
 said they, thou mayest see to the gate of the Coelestial City, as the
 Shepherds that live there will make appear.
 
 
      Now he bethought himself of setting forward, and they were willing he
 should: but first, said they, let us go again into the Armory: So they did;
 and when they came there, they harnessed him from head to foot with what was
 of proof, lest perhaps he should meet with assaults in the way. He being
 therefore thus accoutred, walketh out with his friends to the Gate, and there
 he asked the Porter if he saw any Pilgrims pass by: Then the Porter answered,
 Yes.
 
 
      Chr. Pray, did you know him? said he.
 
 
      Por. I asked his name, and he told me it was Faithful.
 
 
      Chr. O, said Christian, I know him; he is my Townsman, my near Neighbor,
 he comes from the place where I was born: How far do you think he may be
 before?
 
 
      Por. He is got by this time below the Hill.
 
 
      Chr. Well, said Christian, good Porter, the Lord be with thee, and add to
 all thy blessings much increase, for the kindness that thou hast shewed to me.
 
 
 Whilst Christian is among his godly friends,
 Their golden mouths make him sufficient mends
 For all his griefs, and when they let him go,
 He's clad with northern Steel from top to toe.
 
 
      Then he began to go forward; but Discretion, Piety, Charity, and
 Prudence, would accompany him down to the foot of the Hill. So they went on
 together, reiterating their former discourses, till they came to go down the
 Hill. Then said Christian, As it was difficult coming up, so (so far as I can
 see) it is dangerous going down. Yes, said Prudence, so it is, for it is a
 hard matter for a man to go down into the Valley of Humiliation, as thou art
 now, and to catch no slip by the way; therefore, said they, are we come out to
 accompany thee down the Hill. So he began to go down, but very warily; yet he
 caught a slip or two.
 
 
      Then I saw in my Dream that these good Companions, when Christian was
 gone down to the bottom of the Hill, gave him a loaf of Bread, a bottle of
 Wine, and a cluster of Raisins; and then he went on his way.
 
 
      But now, in this Valley of Humiliation, poor Christian was hard put to
 it; for he had gone but a little way, before he espied a foul Fiend coming
 over the field to meet him; his name is Apollyon. Then did Christian begin to
 be afraid, and to cast in his mind whether to go back or to stand his ground:
 But he considered again that he had no Armor for his back, and therefore
 thought that to turn back to him might give him the greater advantage with
 ease to pierce him with his Darts. Therefore he resolved to venture and stand
 his ground; For, thought he, had I no more in mine eye than the saving of my
 life, 'twould be the best way to stand.
 
 
      So he went on, and Apollyon met him. Now the Monster was hideous to
 behold; he was cloathed with scales like a Fish (and they are his pride); he
 had wings like a Dragon, feet like a Bear, and out of his belly came Fire and
 Smoke; and his mouth was as the mouth of a Lion. When he was come up to
 Christian, he beheld him with a disdainful countenance, and thus began to
 question with him.
 
 
      Apol. Whence come you? and whither are you bound?
 
 
      Chr. I am come from the City of Destruction, which is the place of all
 evil, and am going to the City of Zion.
 
 
      Apol. By this I perceive thou art one of my Subjects, for all that
 Country is mine, and I am the Prince and God of it. How is it then thou hast
 run away from thy King? Were it not that I hope thou mayest do me more
 service, I would strike thee now at one blow to the ground.
 
 
      Chr. I was born indeed in your dominions, but your service was hard, and
 your wages such as a man could not live on, for the wages of sin is death;
 therefore when I was come to years, I did as other considerate persons do,
 look out, if perhaps I might mend myself.
 
 
      Apol. There is no Prince that will thus lightly lose his Subjects,
 neither will I as yet lose thee: but since thou complainest of thy service and
 wages, be content to go back; what our Country will afford, I do here promise
 to give thee.
 
 
      Chr. But I have let myself to another, even to the King of Princes, and
 how can I with fairness go back with thee.
 
 
      Apol. Thou hast done in this, according to the Proverb, changed a bad for
 a worse; but it is ordinary for those that have professed themselves his
 Servants, after a while to give him the slip, and return again to me: Do thou
 so too, and all shall be well.
 
 
      Chr. I have given him my faith, and sworn my allegiance to him; how then
 can I go back from this, and not be hanged as a Traitor?
 
 
      Apol. Thou didst the same to me, and yet I am willing to pass by all, if
 now thou wilt yet turn again and go back.
 
 
      Chr. What I promised thee was in my nonage; and besides, I count that the
 Prince under whose Banner now I stand is able to absolve me; yea, and to
 pardon also what I did as to my compliance with thee; and besides, O thou
 destroying Apollyon, to speak truth, I like his Service, his Wages, his
 Servants, his Government, his Company and Country, better than thine; and
 therefore leave off to persuade me further; I am his Servant and I will follow
 him.
 
 
      Apol. Consider again when thou art in cool blood, what thou art like to
 meet with in the way thou that goest. Thou knowest that for the most part, his
 Servants come to an ill end, because they are transgressors against me and my
 ways: How many of them have been put to shameful deaths; and besides, thou
 contest his service better than mine, whereas he never came yet from the place
 where he is to deliver any that served him out of our hands; but as for me,
 how many times, as all the World very well knows, have I delivered, either by
 power or fraud, those that have faithfully served me, from him and his, though
 taken by them; and so I will deliver thee.
 
 
      Chr. His forbearing at present to deliver them is on purpose to try their
 love, whether they will cleave to him to the end; and as for the ill end
 sayest they come to, that is most glorious in their account; for present
 deliverance, they do not much expect it, for they stay for their Glory, and
 then they shall have it, when their Prince comes in his and the Glory of the
 Angels.
 
 
      Apol. Thou hast already been unfaithful in thy service to him, and how
 dost thou think to receive wages of him?
 
 
      Chr. Wherein, O Apollyon, have I been unfaithful to him?
 
 
      Apol. Thou didst faint at first setting out, when thou wast almost choked
 in the Gulf of Dispond; thou didst attempt wrong ways to be rid of thy Burden,
 whereas thou shouldst have stayed till thy Prince had taken it off; thou didst
 sinfully sleep and lose thy choice thing; thou wast also almost persuaded to
 go back, at the sight of the Lions; and when thou talkest of thy Journey, and
 of what thou hast heard and seen, thou art inwardly desirous of vain-glory
 in all that thou sayest or doest.
 
 
      Chr. All this is true, and much more which thou hast left out; but the
 Prince whom I serve and honor is merciful, and ready to forgive; but besides,
 these infirmities possessed me in thy Country, for there I sucked them in, and
 I have groaned under them, been sorry for them, and have obtained Pardon of my
 Prince.
 
 
      Apol. Then Apollyon broke out into a grievous rage, saying, I am an enemy
 to this Prince; I hate his Person, his Laws, and People; I am come out on
 purpose to withstand thee.
 
 
      Chr. Apollyon, beware what you do, for I am in the King's High-way, the
 way of Holiness, therefore take heed to yourself.
 
 
      Apol. Then Apollyon straddled quite over the whole breadth of the way,
 and said, I am void of fear in this matter, prepare thyself to die; for I
 swear by my infernal Den, that thou shalt go no further; here will I spill thy
 soul.
 
 
      And with that he threw a flaming Dart at his breast, but Christian had a
 Shield in his hand, with which he caught it, and so prevented the danger of
 that.
 
 
      Then did Christian draw, for he saw 'twas time to bestir him: and
 Apollyon as fast made at him, throwing Darts as thick as Hail; by the which,
 notwithstanding all that Christian could do to avoid it, Apollyon wounded him
 in his head, his hand, and foot: This made Christian give a little back;
 Apollyon therefore followed his work amain, and Christian again took courage,
 and resisted as manfully as he could. This sore Combat lasted for above half a
 day, even till Christian was almost quite spent; for you must know that
 Christian, by reason of his wounds, must needs grow weaker and weaker.
 
 
 
 
      Then Apollyon espying his opportunity, began to gather up close to
 Christian, and wrestling with him, gave him a dreadful fall; and with that
 Christian's Sword flew out of his hand. Then said Apollyon, I am sure of thee
 now: and with that he had almost pressed him to death, so that Christian began
 to despair of life: but as God would have it, while Apollyon was fetching of
 his last blow, thereby to make a full end of this good man, Christian nimbly
 stretched out his hand for his Sword, and caught it, saying, Rejoice not
 against me, O mine Enemy! when I fall I shall arise; and with that gave him a
 deadly thrust, which made him give back, as one that had received his mortal
 wound: Christian, perceiving that, made at him again, saying, Nay, in all
 these things we are more than Conquerors through him that loved us. And with
 that Apollyon spread forth his Dragon's wings, and sped him away, that
 Christian for a season saw him no more.
 
 
      In this Combat no man can imagine, unless he had seen and heard as I did,
 what yelling and hideous roaring Apollyon made all the time of the fight, he
 spake like a Dragon; and on the other side, what sighs and groans burst from
 Christian's heart. I never saw him all the while give so much as one pleasant
 look, till he perceived he had wounded Apollyon with his two-edged Sword;
 then indeed he did smile, and look upward; but 'twas the dreadfullest sight
 that ever I saw.
 
 
 A more unequal match can hardly be:
 Christian must fight an Angel; but you see
 The Valiant Man by handling Sword and Shield,
 Doth make him, tho' a Dragon, quit the field.
 
 
      So when the Battle was over, Christian said, I will here give thanks to
 him that hath delivered me out of the mouth of the Lion, to him that did help
 me against Apollyon. And so he did, saying,
 
 
 Great Beelzebub, the Captain of this Fiend,
 Design'd my ruin; therefore to this end
 He sent him harness'd out: and he with rage
 That hellish was, did fiercely me engage:
 But blessed Michael helped me, and I
 By dint of Sword did quickly make him fly.
 Therefore to him let me give lasting praise,
 And thank and bless his holy name always.
 
 
      Then there came to him a hand, with some of the leaves of the Tree of
 Life, the which Christian took, and applied to the wounds that he had received
 in the Battle, and was healed immediately. He also sat down in that place to
 eat Bread, and to drink of the Bottle that was given him a little before; so
 being refreshed, he addressed himself to his Journey, with his Sword drawn in
 his hand; for he said, I know not but some other Enemy may be at hand. But he
 met with no other affront from Apollyon quite through this Valley.
 
 
      Now at the end of this Valley was another, called the Valley of the
 Shadow of Death, and Christian must needs go through it, because the way to
 the Coelestial City lay through the midst of it. Now, this Valley is a very
 solitary place. The Prophet Jeremiah thus describes it: A wilderness, a land
 of deserts and of pits, a land of drought, and of the shadow of death, a land
 that no man (but a Christian) passeth through, and where no man dwelt.
 
 
      Now here Christian was worse put to it than in his fight with Apollyon,
 as by the sequel you shall see.
 
 
      I saw then in my Dream, that when Christian was got to the borders of the
 Shadow of Death, there met him two men, Children of them that brought up an
 evil report of the good land, making haste to go back; to whom Christian spake
 as follows,
 
 
      Chr. Whither are you going?
 
 
      Men. They said, Back, back; and we would have you to do so too, if either
 life or peace is prized by you.
 
 
      Chr. Why, what's the matter? said Christian.
 
 
      Men. Matter! said they'; we were going that way as you are going, and
 went as far as we durst; and indeed we were almost past coming back; for had
 we gone a little further, we had not been here to bring the news to thee.
 
 
      Chr. But what have you met with? said Christian.
 
 
      Men. Why we were almost in the Valley of the Shadow of Death; but that by
 good hap we looked before us, and saw the danger before we came to it.
 
 
      Chr. But what have you seen? said Christian.
 
 
      Men. Seen! Why, the Valley itself, which is as dark as pitch; we also saw
 there the Hobgoblins, Satyrs, and Dragons of the Pit; we heard also in that
 Valley a continual howling and yelling, as of a people under unutterable
 misery, who there sat bound in affliction and irons; and over that Valley
 hangs the discouraging clouds of Confusion; Death also doth always spread his
 wings over it. In a word, it is every whit dreadful, being utterly without
 Order.
 
 
      Chr. Then said Christian, I perceive not yet, by what you have said, but
 that this is my way to the desired Haven.
 
 
      Men. Be it thy way; we will not chose it for ours. So they parted, and
 Christian went on his way, but still with his Sword drawn in his hand, for
 fear lest he should be assaulted.
 
 
      I saw then in my Dream, so far as this Valley reached, there was on the
 right hand a very deep Ditch; that Ditch is it into which the blind have led
 the blind in all ages, and have both there miserably perished. Again, behold
 on the left hand, there was a very dangerous Quag, into which, if even good
 man falls, he can find no bottom for his foot to stand on. Into that Quag King
 David once did fall, and had no doubt therein been smothered, had not he that
 is able pluck him out.
 
 
      The path-way was here also exceeding narrow, and therefore good
 Christian was the more put to it; for when he sought in the dark to shun the
 ditch on the one hand, he was ready to tip over into the mire on the other;
 also when he sought to escape the mire, without great carefulness he would be
 ready to fall into the ditch. Thus he went on, and I heard him here sigh
 bitterly; for, besides the dangers mentioned above, the path-way was here so
 dark, that ofttimes, when he lift up his foot to set forward, he knew not
 where, or upon what he should set it next.
 
 
 Poor man! where art thou now? Thy Day is Night.
 Good man be not cast down, thou yet art right:
 Thy way to Heaven lies by the gates of Hell;
 Chear up, hold out, with thee it shall go well.
 
 
      About the midst of this Valley, I perceived the mouth of Hell to be, and
 it stood also hard by the wayside. Now thought Christian, what shall I do? And
 ever and anon the flame and smoke would come out in such abundance, with
 sparks and hideous noises (things that cared not for Christian's Sword, as did
 Apollyon before) that he was forced to put up his Sword, and betake himself to
 another weapon, called All-prayer. So he cried in my hearing, O Lord I
 beseech thee deliver my Soul. Thus he went on a great while, yet still the
 flames would be reaching towards him: Also he heard doleful voices, and
 rushings to and fro, so that sometimes he thought he should be torn in prices,
 or trodden down like mire in the Streets. This frightful sight was seen, and
 these dreadfulnoises were heard by him for several miles together; and coming
 to a place where he thought he heard a company of Fiends coming forward to
 meet him, he stopt, and began to muse what he had best to do. Sometimes he had
 half a thought to go back; then again he thought he might be half way through
 the Valley; he remembered also how he had already vanquished many a danger,
 and that the danger of going back might be much more than for to go forward;
 so he resolved to go on. Yet the Fiends seemed to come nearer and nearer; but
 when they were come even almost at him, he cried out with a most vehement
 voice, I will walk in the strength of the Lord God; so they gave back, and
 came no further.
 
 
      One thing I would not let slip; I took notice that now poor Christian was
 so confounded, that he did not know his own voice; and thus I perceived it;
 Just when he was come over against the mouth of the burning Pit, one of the
 wicked ones got behind him, and stept up softly to him, and whisperingly
 suggested many grievous blasphemies to him, which he verily thought had
 proceeded from his own mind. This put Christian more to it than anything that
 he met with before, even to think that he should now blaspheme him that he
 loved so much before; yet, if he could have helped it, he would not have done
 it; but he had not the discretion neither to stop his ears, nor to know from
 whence those blasphemies came.
 
 
      When Christian had travelled in this disconsolate condition some
 considerable time, he thought he heard the voice of a man, going before him
 saying, Though I walk through the Valley of the Shadow of Death, I will fear
 none ill, for thou art with me.
 
 
      Then was he glad, and that for these reasons:
 
 
      First, Because he gathered from thence, that some who feared God were in
 this Valley as well as himself.
 
 
      Secondly, For that he perceived God was with them, though in that dark
 and dismal state; and why not, thought he, with me? though by reason of the
 impediment that attends this place, I cannot perceive it.
 
 
      Thirdly, For that he hoped, could he overtake them, to have company by
 and by. So he went on, and called to him that was before; but he knew not what
 to answer, for that he also thought himself to be alone. And by and by the day
 broke; then said Christian, He hath turned the Shadow of Death into the
 morning.
 
 
      Now morning being come, he looked back, not out of desire to return, but
 to see, by the light of the day, what hazards he had gone through in the dark.
 So he saw more perfectly the Ditch that was on the one hand, and the Quag that
 was on the other; also how narrow the way was which led betwixt them both;
 also now he saw the Hobgoblins, and Satyrs, and Dragons of the Pit, but all
 afar off; for after break of day, they came not nigh; yet they were discovered
 to him, according to that which is written, He discovered deep things out of
 darkness, and bringeth out to light the Shadow of Death.
 
 
 
 
      Now was Christian much affected with his deliverance from all the dangers
 of his solitary way; which dangers, though he feared them more before, yet he
 saw them more clearly now, because the light of the day made them conspicuous
 to him. And about this time the Sun was rising, and this was another mercy to
 Christian; for you must note, that though the first part of the Valley of the
 Shadow of Death was dangerous, yet this second part which he was yet to go,
 was, if possible, far more dangerous: for from the place where he now stood,
 even to the end of the Valley, the way was all along set so full of Snares,
 Traps, Gins, and Nets here, and so full of Pits, Pitfalls, deep Holes, and
 Shelvings down there, that had it now been dark, as it was when he came the
 first part of the way, had he had a thousand souls, they had in reason been
 cast away; but as I said, just now the Sun was rising. Then said he, His
 candle shineth on my head, and by his light I go through darkness.
 
 
      In this light therefore he came to the end of the Valley. Now I saw in my
 Dream, that at the end of this Valley lay blood, bones, ashes, and mangled
 bodies of men, even of Pilgrims that had gone this way formerly; and while I
 was musing what should be the reason, I espied a little before me a Cave,
 where two Giants, Pope and Pagan, dwelt in old time; by whose power and
 tyranny the men whose bones, blood, ashes, &amp;c. lay there, were cruelly put to
 death. But by this place Christian went without much danger, whereat I
 somewhat wondered; but I have learnt since, that Pagan has been dead many a
 day; and as for the other, though he be yet alive, he is by reason of age, and
 also of the many shrewd brushes that he met with in his younger days, grown so
 crazy, and stiff in his joints, that he can now do little more than sit in his
 Cave's mouth, grinning at Pilgrims as they go by, and biting his nails,
 because he cannot come to them.
 
 
      So I saw that Christian went on his way; yet at the sight of the Old Man
 that sat in the mouth of the Cave, he could not tell what to think, specially
 because he spake to him, though he could not go after him, saying, You will
 never mend till more of you be burned: But he held his peace, and set a good
 face on't, and so went by and catcht no hurt. Then sang Christian,
 
 
 O world of wonders! (I can say no less)
 That I should be preserv'd in that distress
 That I have met with here! O blessed be
 That hand that from it hath delivered me!
 Dangers in darkness, Devils, Hell, and Sin,
 Did compass me, while I this Vale was in:
 Yea, Snares, and Pits, and Traps, and Nets did lie
 My path about, that worthless silly I
 Might have been catch'd, intangled, and cast down;
 But since I live, let Jesus wear the Crown.
 
 
      Now as Christian went on his way, he came to a little ascent, which was
 cast up on purpose that Pilgrims might see before them. Up there therefore
 Christian went, and looking forward, he saw Faithful before him, upon his
 Journey. Then said Christian aloud, Ho, ho, So-ho; stay, and I will be your
 Companion. At that Faithful looked behind him; to whom Christian cried again,
 Stay, stay, till I come up to you: But Faithful answered, No, I am upon my
 life, and the Avenger of Blood is behind me.
 
 
      At this Christian was somewhat moved, and putting to all his strength, he
 quickly got up with Faithful, and did also overrun him, so the last was first.
 Then did Christian vain-gloriously smile, because he had gotten the start of
 his Brother; but not taking good heed to his feet, he suddenly stumbled and
 fell, and could not rise again, until Faithful came up to help him.
 
 
      Then I saw in my Dream they went very lovingly on together, and had sweet
 discourse of all things that had happened to them in their Pilgrimage; and
 thus Christian began:
 
 
      Chr. My honoured and well beloved Brother Faithful, I am glad that I have
 overtaken you; and that God has so tempered our spirits, that we can walk as
 Companions in this so pleasant a path.
 
 
      Faith. I had thought, dear Friend, to have had your company quite from
 our Town; but you did get the start of me, wherefore I was forced to come thus
 much of the way alone.
 
 
      Chr. How long did you stay in the City of Destruction, before you set out
 after me on your Pilgrimage?
 
 
      Faith. Till I could stay no longer; for there was great talk presently
 after you were gone out, that our City would in short time with Fire from
 Heaven be burned down to the ground.
 
 
      Chr. What, did your Neighbors talk so?
 
 
      Faith. Yes, 'twas for a while in everybody's mouth.
 
 
      Chr. What, and did no more of them but you come out to escape the danger?
 
 
      Faith. Though there was, as I said, a great talk thereabout, yet I do not
 think they did firmly believe it. For in the heat of the discourse, I heard
 some of them deridingly speak of you and of your desperate Journey, (for so
 they called this your Pilgrimage) but I did believe, and do still, that the
 end of our City will be with Fire and Brimstone from above; and therefore I
 have made mine escape.
 
 
      Chr. Did you hear no talk of Neighbor Pliable?
 
 
      Faith. Yes Christian, I heard that he followed you till he came at the
 Slough of Dispond, where, as some said, he fell in; but he would not be known
 to have so done; but I am sure he was soundly bedabbled with that kind of
 dirt.
 
 
      Chr. And what said the Neighbors to him?
 
 
      Faith. He hath since his going back been had greatly in derision, and
 that among all sorts of people; some do mock and despise him; and scarce will
 any set him on work. He is now seven times worse than if he had never gone out
 of the City.
 
 
      Chr. But why should they be so set against him, since they also despise
 the way that he forsook?
 
 
      Faith. Oh, they say, Hang him, he is a Turncoat, he was not true to his
 profession: I think God has stirred up even his Enemies to hiss at him, and
 make him a Proverb, because he hath forsaken the way.
 
 
      Chr. Had you no talk with him before you came out?
 
 
      Faith. I met him once in the Streets, but he leered away on the other
 side, as one ashamed of what he had done; so I spake not to him.
 
 
      Chr. Well, at my first setting out, I had hopes of that man; but now I
 fear he will perish in the overthrow of the City, for it is happened to him
 according to the true Proverb, The Dog is turned to his Vomit again, and the
 Sow that was washed to her wallowing in the Mire.
 
 
      Faith. They are my fears of him too; but who can hinder that which will
 be?
 
 
      Chr. Well Neighbor Faithful, said Christian, let us leave him, and talk
 of things that more immediately concern ourselves. Tell me now, what you have
 met with in the way as you came; for I know you have met with some things, or
 else it may be writ for a wonder.
 
 
      Faith. I escaped the Slough that I perceive you fell into, and got up to
 the Gate without that danger; only I met with one whose name was Wanton, that
 had like to have done me a mischief.
 
 
      Chr. 'Twas well you escaped her Net; Joseph was hard put to it by her,
 and he escaped her as you did; but it had like to have cost him his life. But
 what did she do to you?
 
 
      Faith. You cannot think (but that you know something) what a flattering
 tongue she had; she lay at me hard to turn aside with her, promising me all
 manner of content.
 
 
      Chr. Nay, she did not promise you the content of a good conscience.
 
 
      Faith. You know what I mean, all carnal and fleshly content.
 
 
      Chr. Thank God you have escaped her: The abhorred of the Lord shall fall
 into her Ditch.
 
 
      Faith. Nay, I know not whether I did wholly escape her or no.
 
 
      Chr. Why, I tro you did not consent to her desires.
 
 
      Faith. No, not to defile myself; for I remembered an old writing that I
 had seen, which saith, Her steps take hold of Hell. So I shut mine eyes,
 because I would not be bewitched with her looks: then she railed on me, and I
 went my way.
 
 
      Chr. Did you meet with no other assault as you came?
 
 
      Faith. When I came to the foot of the Hill called Difficulty, I met with
 a very aged Man, who asked me, What I was, and whither bound? I told him, That
 I was a Pilgrim, going to the Coelestial City. Then said the old man, Thou
 lookest like an honest fellow; wilt thou be content to dwell with me for the
 wages that I shall give thee? Then I asked him his name, and where he dwelt?
 He said his name was Adam the First, and I dwell in the Town of Deceit. I
 asked him then, What was his work? and what the wages that he would give? He
 told me, That his work was many delights; and his wages, that I should be his
 Heir at last. I further asked him, What House he kept, and what other Servants
 he had? So he told me, That his House was maintained with all the dainties in
 the world; and that his Servants were those of his own begetting. Then I asked
 how many Children he had? He said that he had but three Daughters: The Lust of
 the Flesh, The Lust of the Eyes, and The Pride of Life, and that I should
 marry them all if I would. Then I asked him how long time he would have me
 live with him? And he told me, As long as he lived himself.
 
 
      Chr. Well, and what conclusion came the old man and you to at last?
 
 
      Faith. Why, at first, I felt myself somewhat inclinable to go with the
 man, for I thought he spake very fair; but looking in his forehead, as I
 talked with him, I saw there written, Put off the old man with his deeds.
 
 
      Chr. And how then?
 
 
      Faith. Then it came burning hot into my mind, whatever he said, and
 however he flattered, when he got me home to his House, he would sell me for a
 slave. So I bid him forbear to talk, for I would not come near the door of his
 House. Then he reviled me, and told me that he would send such a one after me,
 that should make my way bitter to my Soul. So I turned to go away from him;
 but just as I turned myself to go thence, I felt him take hold of my flesh and
 give me such a deadly twitch back, that I thought he had pulled part of me
 after himself. This made me cry, O wretched Man! So I went on my way up the
 Hill.
