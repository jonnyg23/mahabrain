 <p>1. At that time the moment had come for the compassionate Judge to re-incarnate in a human form;</p>  
 <p>2. And the eternal Spirit, resting in a state of complete inaction and supreme bliss, awakened and separated from the eternal Being, for an undetermined period,</p>  
 <p>3. So that, in human form, He might teach man to identify himself with the Divinity and attain to eternal felicity;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></a></p>  
 <p>4. And to show, by His example, how man can attain moral purity and free his soul from the domination of the physical senses, so that it may achieve the perfection necessary for it to enter the Kingdom of Heaven, which is immutable and where bliss eternal reigns.</p>  
 <p>5. Soon after, a marvellous child was born in the land of Israel. God himself spoke, through the mouth of this child, of the miseries of the body and the grandeur of the soul.</p>  
 <p>6, The parents of the infant were poor people, who belonged to a family noted for great piety; who forgot the greatness of their ancestors in celebrating the name of the Creator and giving thanks to Him for the trials which He had sent upon them.</p>

 <p>8. The divine child, to whom the name Issa was given, commenced in his tender years to talk of the only and indivisible God, exhorting the strayed souls to repent and purify themselves from the sins of which they had become guilty.</p>  
 <p>9. People came from all parts to hear him, and marvelled at the discourses which came from his infantile mouth; and all Israel agreed that the Spirit of the Eternal dwelt in this child.</p>  
 <p>10. When Issa was thirteen years old, the age at which an Israelite is expected to marry,</p>

 <p>parents became a meeting-place of the rich and illustrious, who were anxious to have as a son-in-law the young Issa, who was already celebrated for the edifying discourses he made in the name of the All-Powerful.</p>  
 <p>12. Then Issa secretly absented himself from his father's house; left Jerusalem, and, in a train of merchants, journeyed toward the Sindh,</p>
