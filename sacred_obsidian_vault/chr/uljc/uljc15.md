 <p>1. Issa went from one city to another,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="green">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p>strengthening by the word of God the courage of the Israelites, who were bear to succumbing under their weight of woe, and thousands of the people followed him to hear his teachings.</p>  
 <p>2. But the chiefs of the cities were afraid of him and they informed the principal governor, residing in Jerusalem, that a man called Issa had arrived in the country, who by his sermons had arrayed the people against the authorities, and that multitudes, listening assiduously to him, neglected their labor; and, they added, he said that in a short time they would be free of their invader rulers.</p>  
 <p>3. Then Pilate, the Governor of Jerusalem, gave orders that they should lay hold of the preacher Issa and bring him before the judges. In order, however, not to excite the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="green">p. 193</font></a></p>  
 <p>anger of the populace, Pilate directed that he should be judged by the priests and scribes, the Hebrew elders, in their temple.</p>  
 <p>4. Meanwhile, Issa, continuing his preachings, arrived at Jerusalem, and the people, who already knew his fame, having learned of his coming, went out to meet him.</p>  
 <p>5. They greeted him respectfully and opened to him the doors of their temple, to hear from his mouth what he had said in other cities of Israel.</p>  
 <p>6. And Issa said to them: "The human race perishes, because of the lack of faith; for the darkness and the tempest have caused the flock to go astray and they have lost their shepherds.</p>  
 <p>7. "But the tempests do not rage forever and the darkness will not hide the light eternally; soon the sky will become serene,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p>the celestial light will again overspread the earth, and the strayed flock will re-unite around their shepherd.</p>  
 <p>8. "Wander not in the darkness, seeking the way, lest ye fall into the ditch; but gather together, sustain one another, put your faith in your God and wait for the first glimmer of light to re-appear.</p>  
 <p>9. "He who sustains his neighbor, sustains himself; and he who protects his family, protects all his people and his country.</p>  
 <p>10. "For, be assured that the day is near when you will be delivered from the darkness; you will be re-united into one family and your enemy will tremble with fear, he who is ignorant of the favor of the great God."</p>  
 <p>11. The priests and the elders who heard him, filled with admiration for his language,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p>asked him if it was true that he had sought to raise the people against the authorities of the country, as had been reported to the governor Pilate.</p>  
 <p>12. "Can one raise against estrayed men, to whom darkness has hidden their road and their door?" answered Issa. "I have but forewarned the unhappy, as I do here in this temple, that they should no longer advance on the dark road, for an abyss opens before their feet.</p>  
 <p>13. "The power of this earth is not of long duration and is subject to numberless changes. It would be of no avail for a man to rise in revolution against it, for one phase of it al ways succeeds another, and it is thus that it will go on until the extinction of human life.</p>  
 <p>14. "But do you not see that the powerful,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></a></p>  
 <p>and the rich, sow among the children of Israel a spirit of rebellion against the eternal power of Heaven?"</p>  
 <p>15. Then the elders asked him: "Who art thou, and from what country hast thou come to us? We have not formerly heard thee spoken of and do not even know thy name!"</p>  
 <p>16. "I am an Israelite," answered Issa; "and on the day of my birth have seen the walls of Jerusalem, and have heard the sobs of my brothers reduced to slavery, and the lamentations of my sisters carried away by the Pagans;</p>  
 <p>17. "And my soul was afflicted when I saw that my brethren had forgotten the true God. When a child I left my father's house to go and settle among other people.</p>  
 <p>18. "But, having heard it said that my brethren suffered even greater miseries now,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> I have come back to the land of my fathers, to recall my brethren to the faith of their ancestors, which teaches us patience upon earth in order to attain the perfect and supreme bliss above."</p>  
 <p>19. Then the wise old men put to him again this question: "We are told that thou disownest the laws of Mossa, and that thou teachest the people to forsake the temple of God?"</p>  
 <p>20. Whereupon Issa: "One does not demolish that which has been given by our Heavenly Father, and which has been destroyed by sinners. I have but enjoined the people to purify the heart of all stains, for it is the veritable temple of God.</p>  
 <p>21. "As regards the laws of Mossa, I have endeavored to re-establish them in the hearts of men; and I say unto you that ye ignore</p>  
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p>their true meaning, for it is not vengeance but pardon which they teach. Their sense has been perverted."</p>
