 <p><a name="iii.vii.ii-p13"></a><b>30.</b> <i>And all the tithe of the land.</i> In these words God shews that in assigning the tithes to the Levites, He ceded His own rights, inasmuch as they were a kind of royal revenue; and thus He bars all complaint, since otherwise the other tribes might have murmured on being unduly 				burdened. He therefore appoints the priests as His receivers, to collect in His name what could not be refused without impious and sacrilegious fraudulency. In the provision that, where the tithes are redeemed by a money payment, a fifth part should be added to their value, the object is not that the Levites should make a gain of the loss of others; but, because the owners of property craftily aimed at some advantage in this commutation of corn for money, frauds are thus prevented whereby 				something would be lost to the Levites by this deceptive exchange. On the same grounds He commands that the animals, whatever they might be, should be given as tithe, and does not permit them to be redeemed by money, since, if the choice had been free, no fat or healthy animal would have ever come to the Levites. Therefore, in this law a remedy was applied to avarice and meanness, and not without good cause; for if the proverb be true, that “good 				laws spring from evil habits,”   				 <a name="fr_215"></a><a href="#fn_215"><font size="1">216</font></a>
  				 it was necessary that so covetous and ill-disposed a people should be restrained in the path of duty by the utmost severity. And although such careful provision was made for the Levites, yet there was scarcely any period in which they did not suffer from want, and sometimes they wandered about half-starved; nay, after the return from the Babylonish captivity, the memory of so great a blessing did not prevent a part of the tithes from being surreptitiously withheld 				from them; as God complains in <a name="iii.vii.ii-p14.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal003.htm#008">Mal 3:8</a><a name="iii.vii.ii-p14.3"></a>. Whence it appears that it was not without purpose that the people were so imperiously enjoined to pay them.</p>
