 <p><a name="iii.v.v-p17"></a><b>22.</b> <i>And the Lord spake unto Moses.</i> A part of the sacerdotal duties, of which mention is constantly made in the Law, is here briefly set forth; for God says that He had appointed the priests to bless the people. To this David seems to allude in the 				words:</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.v-p18"></a>"We have blessed you out of the house of the Lord.” <br> 				(<a name="iii.v.v-p18.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#026">Ps 118:26</a><a name="iii.v.v-p18.2"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.v.v-p19"></a>This doctrine is especially profitable, that believers may confidently assure themselves that God is reconciled to them, when He ordains the priests to be witnesses and heralds of His paternal favor towards them. The word to <i>bless </i>is often used for to pray for blessings, which is the common duty of all pious persons; but this rite (as we shall see a little farther on) was an efficacious testimony of God’s grace; as if the priests 				bore from His own mouth the commandment to bless. But Luke shews that this was truly fulfilled in Christ, when he relates that “He lifted up His hands,” according to the solemn rite of the Law, to bless His disciples. (<a name="iii.v.v-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#050">Lu 24:50</a><a name="iii.v.v-p19.1"></a>.) In these words, then, the priests were appointed ambassadors to reconcile God to the people; and this in the person of Christ, who is the only sufficient surety of God’s grace 				and blessing. Inasmuch, therefore, as they then were types of Christ, they were commanded to bless the people. But it is worthy of remark, that they are commanded to pronounce the form of benediction audibly, and not to offer prayers in an obscure whisper; and hence we gather that they preached God’s grace, which the people might apprehend by faith.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.v-p20"></a><a name="iii.v.v-p20.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.v.v-p21"></a><b>24.</b> <i>The Lord bless thee.</i> Blessing is an act of His genuine liberality, because the abundance of all good things is derived to us from His favor as their only source. It is next added, that He should “keep” the people, by which clause lie intimates that He is the sole defender of the 				Church, and protects it under His guardianship; but since the main advantage of God’s grace consists in our sense of it, the words, “and make His face shine on you,” are added; for nothing is more desirable for the consummation of our happiness, than that. we should behold the serene countenance of God; as it is said in <a name="iii.v.v-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa004.htm#006">Ps 4:6</a><a name="iii.v.v-p21.1"></a>,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.v.v-p22"></a>"There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us."</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.v.v-p23"></a>Thus then I interpret this clause, that the people may perceive and taste the sweetness of God’s goodness, which may cheer them like the brightness of the sun when it illumines the world in serene weather. But immediately afterwards the people are recalled to the First cause; viz., God’s gratuitous mercy, which alone reconciles Him to us, when we should be otherwise by our own deserts hated and detested by Him. What follows, “The<i> 				</i>Lord lift up his countenance upon thee,” is a common phrase of Scripture, meaning, May God remember His people; not that forgetfulness can occur in Him, but because we suppose that He has cast away His care of us, unless He actually gives proof of His anxiety for our welfare. Finally, it is added, may He “establish peace upon his people,” which others translate a little less literally,  				 <a name="fr_196"></a><a href="#fn_196"><font size="1">197</font></a>
  				“put thee into peace:” and since this word signifies not only rest and a tranquil state, but also all prosperity and success, I willingly embrace this latter sense, although even its proper signification is not disagreeable to me.  				 <a name="fr_197"></a><a href="#fn_197"><font size="1">198</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.v.v-p26"></a><a name="iii.v.v-p26.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.v.v-p27"></a><b>27.</b> <i>And they shall put my name.</i> Although <i>Jerome </i>has rightly translated this, “They shall call upon my name:” yet since the Hebrew phrase is emphatic, I have preferred retaining it; for God deposits His name with the priests, that 				they may daily bring it forward as a pledge of His good will, and of the salvation which proceeds from thence. The promise, which is finally subjoined, gives assurance that this was no empty or useless ceremony, when He declares that He will bless the people. And hence we gather, that whatsoever the ministers of the Church do by God’s command, is ratified by Him with a real and solid result; since He declares nothing by His ministers which He will not Himself fulfill and perform by the efficacy 				of His Spirit. But we must observe that He does not so transfer the office of blessing to His priests, as to resign this right to them; for after having entrusted this ministry to them, He claims the accomplishment of the thing for Himself alone.</p>
