 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p35"></a><b>1.</b> <i>Observe the month Abib.</i> For what purpose God instituted the Passover, has already been shewn in the exposition of the First Commandment; for since it was a symbol of redemption, and in that ceremony the people exercised themselves in the pure worship of the One God, so as to 				acknowledge Him to be their only Father, and to distinguish Him from all idols, I thought that the actual slaying of the lamb should be introduced amongst the Supplements to the First Commandment. It only remains for us to speak here of what relates to the Sabbath. This then was the first solemn day, on which God would have His people rest and go up to Jerusalem, forsaking all their business. But mention is here made not only of the Paschal Lamb, but He also commands sheep and oxen to be slain 				in the place which He should choose. In these words He signifies that on that day a holy convocation was to be held; which is soon after more clearly expressed, for I have already given the two intermediate verses in the institution of the Passover itself, He therefore prohibits their slaying the Passover apart in their own cities, but would have them all meet in the same sanctuary. It has been elsewhere said that one altar was prescribed for them, as if God would gather them under one banner 				for the preservation of concord and the unity of the faith. What is added respecting the solemnity of the seventh day is very appropriate to this place.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.iv-p36"></a><a name="v.v.iv-p36.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p37"></a><b>9.</b> <i>Seven weeks shalt thou number.</i> It must be observed that the Passover fell in a part of the year when the harvests were beginning to ripen; and consequently the first-fruits, of which I treated under the First Commandment, were then offered. Seven weeks afterwards they celebrated 				another feast-day, which was called Pentecost, <i>i.e., </i>the fiftieth, by the Greeks. There was just this number of days between the departure of the people and the publication of the Law. Another offering of first-fruits was then made, in which each one, according to his ability, and in proportion to the produce of the year, consecrated a gift to God of the harvested fruits. In order that they might be more ready and cheerful in their liberality, 				God’s blessing is set before them, as if Moses had commanded the people to testify their gratitude; since whatever springs from the earth, is the mere bounty of God Himself.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.iv-p38"></a><a name="v.v.iv-p38.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p39"></a><b>11.</b> <i>And thou shalt require.</i> On another ground he exhorts and excites them to willingness, because the service of God brings this rejoicing; for there is nothing which ought more to stimulate us to obedience, that when we know that God rather consults our good than seeks to obtain any 				advantage from us. Ungodly men, indeed, rejoice also, nay, they are wanton and intemperate in their joy; but since that joy is not only transient, but their laughter is turned into weeping and gnashing of teeth, it is not without cause that Moses here magnifies it as a peculiar blessing, to rejoice before God; as if a father should invite his children to delight themselves together with him. But by this external exercise, believers were reminded that there is no real or desirable joy, unless in 				reference to God. And surely, however the wicked may exult in their pleasures, and abandon themselves to gratifcations, still, since tranquillity of conscience, which alone brings true rejoicing, is wanting to them, they do not enjoy the merriment into which they plunge themselves. Finally, Moses amplifies by a comparison the good which they enjoyed in the service of God, when he says, “And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt;” for that their present condition might be more 				pleasant to them, he heightened its sweetness by the recollection of their most miserable captivity. I have here neglected Cicero’s   				 <a name="fr_359"></a><a href="#fn_359"><font size="1">360</font></a>
  				 very subtle distinction between the words <i>gaudium </i>and <i>laetitia, </i>for unless I take both of them in a good sense, I could not translate the Hebrew words, whereby God would express how indulgently He deals with His children. Meanwhile, this passage contains an exhortation to render thanks to God our deliverer.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.iv-p41"></a><a name="v.v.iv-p41.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p42"></a><b>13.</b> <i>Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles.</i> Its first day was called the day of In-gathering, (<a name="v.v.iv-p42.1"></a><i>collectionum</i>,) because the produce of the whole year was then stored in their 				granaries   				 <a name="fr_360"></a><a href="#fn_360"><font size="1">361</font></a>
  				 and provision cellars. Since, therefore, they then rested from their rural labors, it was a convenient time of year for the celebration of the festivals; for in order that they might more willingly go up to Jerusalem, it was arranged by God, that it should be done with but little expense and sacrifice of their domestic interests. Where our translation is, “When Jehovah shall have blessed thee,” it stands literally, “Because he shall bless thee,”   				 <a name="fr_361"></a><a href="#fn_361"><font size="1">362</font></a>
  				 but the sense is nearly the same; for Moses assures them that, provided they devote their minds diligently and faithfully to the service of God, they shall never want grounds for rejoicing, since He will never interrupt the flow of His blessing. The end, therefore, of the fifteenth verse, is not a mere command, but also a promise; as if he had said, that, if they were not ungrateful, there was no fear but that God would continually supply new cause for gladness; 				and these two clauses are to be taken in connection, “God will bless thee, and, therefore, thou shalt only rejoice;” for in this passage I willingly interpret thus   				 <a name="fr_362"></a><a href="#fn_362"><font size="1">363</font></a>
  				 the particle <a name="v.v.iv-p46.2"></a>אך, <i>ak. </i>It is indeed absurd to take it <i>adversatively. </i>It will not, therefore, be improper to explain it <i>exclusively, </i>as if he said, that, there should be no sorrow or 				anxiety, which should hinder them from the performance of their pious duty; those who render it “<i>surely,” </i>approach also to this meaning.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="v.v.iv-p47"></a><a name="v.v.iv-p47.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p48"></a><b>16.</b> <i>Three times in a year.</i> We have previously said that although the other feast-days were not to be neglected, still, because God would make some allowance for the infirmity of His people, the necessity of going up to Jerusalem five times a year was not imposed upon them. Again, 				because only half of the seventh month contained three feast-days, i.e., from the first to the fifteenth, for the same reason it is only required of the males that they should leave their houses and celebrate the sacred convocations; for thus the females are spared, to whom traveling is not so convenient. Besides, through the fecundity promised them by God, they were almost always either pregnant or nursing. It is also certain that the boys and young men were excepted under the age of twenty, 				since God includes under the term males only those who were comprised in the census. If any object that in God’s spiritual worship there is no difference between males and females; the reply is easy, that the fathers of families presented themselves there in the names of their wives and children: so that the profession was extended to the other sex, and to those of tender age. To this David seems to allude, when he says:   				 <a name="fr_363"></a><a href="#fn_363"><font size="1">364</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="v.v.iv-p50"></a>"Thy people shall come with voluntary offerings in the day of thy assembly, in the beauties of holiness,” (<a name="v.v.iv-p50.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#003">Ps 110:3</a><a name="v.v.iv-p50.1"></a>;)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p51"></a>for, speaking of the free-will-offerings of the people, he seeks an example of it, after the manner of the prophets, from the legal worship. Lest the Jews should object that there was danger of hostile invasion, if the land should be stripped of its defenses by the gathering together of all the men into one place, God anticipates this doubt in <a name="v.v.iv-p51.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#000">Exodus 34</a><a name="v.v.iv-p51.1"></a>, promising that He will provide that no one shall desire to assail 				their forsaken homes; for to this the sentence refers: “<i>I will cast out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders, so that no man shall desire thy land</i>,” <a name="v.v.iv-p51.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#024">Ex 34:24</a><a name="v.v.iv-p51.2"></a> Whence also we gather, that God’s worship was not entirely established until all the neighboring 				nations were subdued, and He had placed His sanctuary in Mount Zion. Not that it was allowable for the people to omit the feast-days before that time; but that experience itself might teach them that God was wroth with them, whilst He deprived them of this special blessing; for fear and alarm arose only from their own fault. But let believers collect from hence the useful doctrine that, whenever they are following God, they will be safe under His protection, since it is in His power to repel 				the assaults of enemies, and everything that can harm them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="v.v.iv-p52"></a><i>And they shall not appear before the Lord empty,</i>   				 <a name="fr_364"></a><a href="#fn_364"><font size="1">365</font></a>
  				 I know not how it could have entered the minds of some to suppose that God here promised that all should be rich who should present themselves three times (a year) before His sanctuary: whereas it is plain from the words of Moses that He requires from every one some gift in token of their gratitude. And perhaps   				 <a name="fr_365"></a><a href="#fn_365"><font size="1">366</font></a>
  				 what historians relate respecting the Persians, that none should dare to address the king without a gift, was a more ancient custom, and common to other nations. God would indeed have a gift presented Him by each individual, as a symbol or earnest of their subjection; and, although this legal rite has ceased, yet its substance is to be retained, viz., that those only are true servants of God who do not boastfully make a mere empty profession, but effectually 				testify that they acknowledge Him as their King.</p>
