 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p35"></a><b>4</b>  <i>Ye shall not do so unto the Lord your God.</i> The principal distinction, as far as regards the external exercises of devotion, is here laid down between the legitimate worship of God, and all the fictitious rites which the Gentiles have invented; viz., 				that God would have but one sanctuary and one altar, which might be a symbol of the difference between Himself and all idols; and thus that true religion should have no affinity to superstitions. To this refers the prohibition, that the Israelites should not conduct themselves towards God as the Gentiles did towards their idols; but that a barrier should be raised, which would separate   				 <a name="fr_102"></a><a href="#fn_102"><font size="1">103</font></a>
  				 them from the whole world. The whole external profession of God’s worship is fitly annexed to the Second Commandment, because upon that it depends, and has no other object than its due observation. But when I begin to speak of the tabernacle, the priesthood, and the sacrifices, I am entering on a deep and vast ocean, in which many interpreters, whilst indulging their curiosity, have pursued a wild and wandering course. Admonished, therefore, by their example, I 				will take in my sails, and only touch upon a few points which tend to edification in the faith. But my readers must now be requested, not only to pardon me for abstaining from subtle speculations, but also themselves willingly to keep within the bounds of simplicity. Many have itching ears; and in our natural vanity, most men are more delighted by foolish allegories, than by solid erudition. But let those who shall desire to profit in God’s school, learn to restrain this perverse desire of 				knowing more than is good for them, although it may tickle their minds. Now let us consider the words of Moses.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p37"></a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p37.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p38"></a><b>5</b> <i> But unto the place which the Lord your God shall choose.</i> It is asked why God would have sacrifices offered to Him only on one altar? Besides the reason which I have lately advanced, it is not to be doubted but that He in this way had regard to 				believers, that He might cherish in them an agreement in the unity of the faith. This place, then, was like a standard to gather together the people, lest their religion should be torn by divisions, and lest any diversities should insinuate themselves. Moreover, God, by claiming His right and authority to choose the place, commends obedience, on which also the purity of worship depends. But, again, another question arises; because, before the time of David, the Ark had nowhere a fixed 				resting-place, but traveled about, as it were, to various lodgings, therefore, if the chosen place is understood to be Mount Zion, the people were free in the intermediate time to perform the sacrifices wherever they pleased. I reply, that the place was not, chosen until the Ark was placed in Zion; for not till then was fulfilled what is said in the Psalm,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p39"></a>"I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord; <br> 				our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem,” <br> 				(<a name="iii.iii.vi-p39.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001">Ps 122:1-2</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p39.3"></a>;)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p40"></a>in which words the Prophet intimates that there was before no resting-place, because God had not yet pointed out the place in which He would be worshipped. Therefore it is expressly said, “out of all your tribes,” or “in one of your tribes,” whereby a special privilege is referred to, which was to be conferred on one of their tribes, to the exclusion of the others. And to this relates what is said in another Psalm,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p41"></a>"Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim, but chose the tribe of Judah, the Mount Zion which he loved: and he built his sanctuary like high <i>palaces, </i>like the earth, which he hath established for ever.” <br> 				(<a name="iii.iii.vi-p41.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa078.htm#067">Ps 78:67-69</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p41.2"></a> )</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p42"></a>To the same effect the faithful elsewhere congratulate themselves, after the Ark was deposited with David, “We will go into his tabernacles, we will worship at his footstool;” and, on the other hand, the Spirit declares,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p43"></a>"The Lord hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his habitation. This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have desired it ” (<a name="iii.iii.vi-p43.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa132.htm#013">Ps 132:13-14</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p43.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p44"></a>Similar statements everywhere occur, confirming the opinion that the Ark never rested in its true home until it was deposited on Zion; and God, in my judgment, in order that He might keep the hope of His people in suspense, promised, although the Ark changed its place from time to time, that He had still determined on a perpetual abode in which it should rest. Yet it does not therefore follow that, up to that period, a free permission 				was given to the people to sacrifice wherever they would. For, wherever the sanctuary was, there was also a temporary choice of the place, until the legitimate resting-place was shewn them. Therefore God, chastising by Jeremiah the foolish confidence by which the Jews were puffed up, said,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p45"></a>"Go ye now unto my place, which was in Shiloh, <br> 				and see what I did to it,” etc., (<a name="iii.iii.vi-p45.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#012">Jer 7:12</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p45.2"></a>;)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p46"></a>in which words he implies that Shiloh had been highly honored for a season, but had now been deprived of its honor, because the sacrifices had there been unworthily polluted.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p47"></a>Although, then, there is a special promise here concerning Zion, still there is no doubt but that God in the meantime confines the Jews to His sanctuary, lest any one should erect a private altar for himself, or build for himself other cities and other temples. The phrase is worthy of observation, “to put his name there;” and again, “his habitation.” The gross imaginations of men are thus obviated, lest the people should enclose God 				within walls, as they are wont to circumscribe His infinite essence, or to draw Him down from heaven, and to place Him beneath the elements of the world. But God’s name is said to inhabit a place, not in His own nature, but with reference to man; whilst, in deference to their ignorance, He sets before their eyes a visible symbol of His presence. Thus He is often said to “come down,” not as if He, who fills heaven and earth, actually moved, but because the familiar knowledge of Him brings 				Him near to men. But although He allows Himself to be invoked on earth, yet He would not have the minds of men rest there, but rather lifts them up on high as if by steps. Therefore, by Isaiah, He harshly chides them, because, although enwrapped in their sins, they still thought that He was under obligation to them because His temple was in their sight, (<a name="iii.iii.vi-p47.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001">Isa 66:1</a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p47.1"></a>,) whereas it is our business to approach 				Him by faith and with serious feelings when He extends His hand to us. The Ark of the Covenant indeed is often called “His face;” but, lest men should form any gross or earthly conceptions of Him, the sanctuary is also called “His footstool."</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p48"></a>The various kinds of oblations which are here enumerated will be hereafter more clearly explained. I will only briefly remind you that the burnt-offerings are included in the sacrifices, as a part is taken for the whole. The Hebrew word, which we have translated “the elevating of the hand,” is, <a name="iii.iii.vi-p48.2"></a>תרומה, <i>therumah, </i>  				 <a name="fr_103"></a><a href="#fn_103"><font size="1">104</font></a>
  				 to which another word, <a name="iii.iii.vi-p49.6"></a>תנופה, <i>thenuphah, </i>is often added; but, although both are derived from the act of elevating, still they seem to differ, and those skilled in the language thus distinguish them, viz., that <a name="iii.iii.vi-p49.7"></a>תרומה, <i>therumah, </i>is to be lifted up, and then brought down; and, <a name="iii.iii.vi-p49.8"></a>תנופה, <i>thanuphah, </i>to be turned at the same time to the right and left, although others think it means to be turned round to the four quarters of the globe. There is a 				difference between vows and freewill-offerings; for although a vow is at first freely made, yet we may offer things which we have not vowed. I have already spoken of the firstlings.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p50"></a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p50.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p51"></a><b>7</b>  <i>And there shall ye eat.</i> We see that the sanctuary in which God manifested Himself is called His face;   				 <a name="fr_104"></a><a href="#fn_104"><font size="1">105</font></a>
  				 for, although believers are taught that always, wherever they dwell, they walk before God; yet they placed themselves nearer, and in some special manner in His sight, when they approached His sanctuary. By this mode of speaking God also stimulates the laziness or tardiness of the people, lest it should be irksome to them to come to the Ark of the Covenant for the purpose of sacrificing, inasmuch as this inestimable benefit would compensate for the labor and 				expense of the journey. I have elsewhere shewn that, when men are said to feast before the Lord, sacred feasts are thus distinguished from our daily meals. For this was as it were an accessory to the sacrifices, to eat what remained of the victims; and in this way the guests were made partakers of the offering, which custom even heathen nations imitated, though improperly. Again, God kindly invites them when He says, “ye shall rejoice in all that thou puttest thine hands unto,” for which some 				translate it, “in everything to which you shall have sent your hand;” literally it is, “in the sending forth of the land.” There is no ambiguity in the sense, for it refers to those works which require the motion and application of the hands. A little below, where I have translated it, “which he hath blessed,” (<i>quibus benedixerit,</i>) some insert the proposition <i>in, </i>and supply the pronoun <i>you, </i>(<i>i.e., in </i>which he hath blessed <i>you;</i>) but it is quite appropriate to say, that God blesses their works, although it may be understood of their families 				also. As to the command that the tithes should be eaten in the holy place, I do not extend it to tithes in general,   				 <a name="fr_105"></a><a href="#fn_105"><font size="1">106</font></a>
  				 for it was hardly probable that the food of those who were dispersed through various cities should be transferred to another place, so that they would perish (at home)   				 <a name="fr_106"></a><a href="#fn_106"><font size="1">107</font></a>
  				 from hunger; but I understand it of the second tithes, which the Levites separated to be a special and peculiar oblation; for we shall see elsewhere that what remained over passed into the nature of ordinary produce, as if the Levites ate of the fruits of their own possessions.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p55"></a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p55.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p56"></a><b>8</b>  <i>Ye shall not do after all.</i> Even then they observed the rite of sacrifice handed down to them from the fathers; but since as yet they were wandering in the desert, it was lawful for them to build altars anywhere, until an end should be put to their 				journeyings. And this Moses expressly declares, adding the reason, viz., that they had not yet entered into the rest which the Lord had promised them. He shews them, then, that when they shall have attained the tranquil possession of the land, there would be no further room for excuse if they should sacrifice wheresoever it pleased them. When, therefore, it is said that they then did “ever<i>y </i>man whatsoever was right in his own eyes,” it does not 				extend to any of the inventions which men devise for themselves in the worship of God, but only points out a freer system and form in the exercise of devotion, before the place was shewn them in which they must stay their foot.   				 <a name="fr_107"></a><a href="#fn_107"><font size="1">108</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p58"></a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p58.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p59"></a><b>10.</b> <i>But when ye go over Jordan.</i> This verse confirms what I have before said, that the Jews were constrained to a certain rule as soon as they should have reached the promised land; and yet that the place in which the Ark was perpetually to rest, would not be immediately 				manifested to them; for what is declared at the end of the verse, that God would give them rest round about, so that they should dwell in safety, was not in fact perfectly exhibited before the time of David. Still God would have them, as soon as they were in enjoyment of the land, come together even from their remotest boundaries to the sanctuary. He omits certain kinds of offerings of which he had lately spoken, and puts, instead of “vows<i>,</i>” 				  				 <a name="fr_108"></a><a href="#fn_108"><font size="1">109</font></a>
  				 “the choice vows,” which some translate “very choice vows,” or “the chief things in your vows.” I do not reject this; but the other sense is more simple, that all the vows were comprised which every one had made of his own free judgment and choice. Soon afterwards he more fully expresses his meaning, when he prohibits them from offering sacrifices of their own accord in any places that might please them; for, “to see a place<i>,</i>” here, is equivalent to being carried away by the sight, so as to connect religion and holiness with elegance and beauty.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iii.vi-p61"></a><a name="iii.iii.vi-p61.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iii.iii.vi-p62"></a><b>26</b>  <i>Only thy holy things.</i> This passage more clearly explains what was meant by the foregoing precepts, viz., that but one place was set apart for the performance of their sacred rites, lest, if each should offer wherever it pleased him, religion should 				be corrupted, and by degrees the various altars should beget as many gods. He therefore commands that all the victims should be sacrificed on one altar, with a provision that the blood should be poured out.</p>
