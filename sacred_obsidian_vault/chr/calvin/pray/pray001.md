 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p1"></a>1. A general summary of what is contained in the previous part of the work. A  transition to the doctrine of prayer. Its connection with the subject of faith.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p2"></a>2. Prayer defined. Its necessity and use.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p3"></a>3. Objection, that prayer seems useless, because God already knows our wants.  Answer, from the institution and end of prayer. Confirmation by example. Its  necessity and propriety. Perpetually reminds us of our duty, and leads to  meditation on divine providence. Conclusion. Prayer a most useful exercise. This  proved by three passages of Scripture.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p4"></a>4. Rules to be observed in prayer. First, reverence to God. How the mind ought to be composed.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p5"></a>5. All giddiness of mind must be excluded, and all our feelings seriously engaged.  This confirmed by the form of lifting the hand in prayer. We must ask only in so  far as God permits. To help our weakness, God gives the Spirit to be our guide  in prayer. What the office of the Spirit in this respect. We must still pray  both with the heart and the lips.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p6"></a>6. Second rule of prayer, a sense of our want. This rule violated, 1. By  perfunctory and formal prayer 2. By hypocrites who have no sense of their sins.  3. By giddiness in prayer. Remedies.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p7"></a>7. Objection, that we are not always under the same necessity of praying. Answer,  we must pray always. This answer confirmed by an examination of the dangers by  which both our life and our salvation are every moment threatened. Confirmed  farther by the command and permission of God, by the nature of true repentance,  and a consideration of impenitence. Conclusion.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p8"></a>8. Third rule, the suppression of all pride. Examples. Daniel, David, Isaiah,  Jeremiah, Baruch.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p9"></a>9. Advantage of thus suppressing pride. It leads to earnest entreaty for pardon,  accompanied with humble confession and sure confidence in the Divine mercy. This  may not always be expressed in words. It is peculiar to pious penitents. A  general introduction to procure favour to our prayers never to be omitted.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p10"></a>10. Objection to the third rule of prayer. Of the glorying of the saints. Answer.  Confirmation of the answer.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p11"></a>11. Fourth rule of prayer, — a sure confidence of being heard animating us to  prayer. The kind of confidence required, viz., a serious conviction of our  misery, joined with sure hope. From these true prayer springs. How diffidence  impairs prayer. In general, faith is required.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p12"></a>12. This faith and sure hope regarded by our opponents as most absurd. Their error  described and refuted by various passages of Scripture, which show that  acceptable prayer is accompanied with these qualities. No repugnance between  this certainty and an acknowledgment of our destitution.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p13"></a>13. To our unworthiness we oppose, 1. The command of God. 2. The promise. Rebels and  hypocrites completely condemned. Passages of Scripture confirming the command to  pray.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p14"></a>14. Other passages respecting the promises which belong to the pious when they  invoke God. These realised though we are not possessed of the same holiness as  other distinguished servants of God, provided we indulge no vain confidence, and  sincerely betake ourselves to the mercy of God. Those who do not invoke God  under urgent necessity are no better than idolaters. This concurrence of fear  and confidence reconciles the different passages of Scripture, as to humbling  ourselves in prayer, and causing our prayers to ascend.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p15"></a>15. Objection founded on some examples, viz., that prayers have proved effectual,  though not according to the form prescribed. Answer. Such examples, though not  given for our imitation, are of the greatest use. Objection, the prayers of the  faithful sometimes not effectual. Answer confirmed by a noble passage of  Augustine. Rule for right prayer.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p16"></a>16. The above four rules of prayer not so rigidly exacted, as that every prayer  deficient in them in any respect is rejected by God. This shown by examples.  Conclusion, or summary of this section.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p17"></a>17. Through whom God is to be invoked, viz., Jesus Christ. This founded on a  consideration of the divine majesty, and the precept and promise of God himself.  God therefore to be invoked only in the name of Christ.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p18"></a>18. From the first all believers were heard through him only: yet this specially  restricted to the period subsequent to his ascension. The ground of this  restriction.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p19"></a>19. The wrath of God lies on those who reject Christ as a Mediator. This excludes  not the mutual intercession of saints on the earth.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p20"></a>20. Refutation of errors interfering with the intercession of Christ. 1. Christ the  Mediator of redemption; the saints mediators of intercession. Answer confirmed  by the clear testimony of Scripture, and by a passage from Augustine. The nature  of Christ's intercession.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p21"></a>21. Of the intercession of saints living with Christ in heaven. Fiction of the  Papists in regard to it. Refuted. 1. Its absurdity. 2. It is nowhere mentioned  by Scripture. 3. Appeal to the conscience of the superstitious. 4. Its  blasphemy. Exception. Answers.</p>

 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p23"></a>23. Arguments of the Papists for the intercession of saints. 1. From the duty and  office of angels. Answer. 2. From an expression of Jeremiah respecting Moses and  Samuel. Answer, retorting the argument. 3. The meaning of the prophet confirmed  by a similar passage in Ezekiel, and the testimony of an apostle.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p24"></a>24. 4. Fourth papistical argument from the nature of charity, which is more perfect  in the saints in glory. Answer.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p25"></a>25. Argument founded on a passage in Moses. Answer.</p>

 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p27"></a>27. Conclusion, that the saints cannot be invoked without impiety. 1. It robs God of  his glory. 2. Destroys the intercession of Christ. 3. Is repugnant to the word  of God. 4. Is opposed to the due method of prayer. 5. Is without approved  example. 6. Springs from distrust. Last objection. Answer.</p>

 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p33"></a>33. Public prayers should be in the vulgar, not in a foreign tongue. Reason, 1. The  nature of the Church. 2. Authority of an apostle.

 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p37"></a>37. Objection, that our sins exclude us from the presence of him whom we have made a  Judge, not a Father.

 <p class="noindent"><a name="ii-p45"></a>45. Close connection between this and the subsequent petition. Why our sins are  called debts. This petition violated, 1.
