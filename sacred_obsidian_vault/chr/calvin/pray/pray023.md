 <p><a name="iii.xxi-p1"></a>In regard to the saints who having died in the body live in Christ,  if we attribute prayer to them, let us not imagine that they have any other way  of supplicating God than through Christ who alone is the way, or that their  prayers are accepted by God in any other name. Wherefore, since the Scripture  calls us away from all others to Christ alone, since our heavenly Father is  pleased to gather together all things in him, it were the extreme of stupidity,  not to say madness, to attempt to obtain access by means of others, so as to be  drawn away from him without whom access cannot be obtained. But who can deny  that this was the practice for several ages, and is still the practice, wherever  Popery prevails? To procure the favour of God, human merits are ever and anon  obtruded, and very frequently while Christ is passed by, God is supplicated in  their name. I ask if this is not to transfer to them that office of sole  intercession which we have above claimed for Christ? Then what angel or devil  ever announced one syllable to any human being concerning that fancied  intercession of theirs? There is not a word on the subject in Scripture. What  ground then was there for the fiction? Certainly, while the human mind thus  seeks help for itself in which it is not sanctioned by the word of God, it  plainly manifests its distrust (see s. 27). But if we appeal to the consciences  of all who take pleasure in the intercession of saints, we shall find that their  only reason for it is, that they are filled with anxiety, as if they supposed  that Christ were insufficient or too rigorous. By this anxiety they dishonour  Christ, and rob him of his title of sole Mediator, a title which being given him  by the Father as his special privilege, ought not to be transferred to any  other. By so doing they obscure the glory of his nativity and make void his  cross; in short, divest and defraud of due praise everything which he did or  suffered, since all which he did and suffered goes to show that he is and ought  to be deemed sole Mediator. At the same time, they reject the kindness of God in  manifesting himself to them as a Father, for he is not their Father if they do  not recognize Christ as their brother. This they plainly refuse to do if they  think not that he feels for them a brother's affection; affection than which  none can be more gentle or tender. Wherefore Scripture offers him alone, sends  us to him, and establishes us in him. "He," says Ambrose, "is our mouth by which  we speak to the Father; our eye by which we see the Father; our right hand by  which we offer ourselves to the Father. Save by his intercession neither we nor  any saints have any intercourse with God" (Ambros. Lib. de Isaac et Anima). If  they object that the public prayers which are offered up in churches conclude  with the words, <i>through Jesus Christ our Lord</i>, it is a frivolous evasion;  because no less insult is offered to the intercession of Christ by confounding  it with the prayers and merits of the dead, than by omitting it altogether, and  making mention only of the dead. Then, in all their litanies, hymns, and proses  where every kind of honour is paid to dead saints, there is no mention of  Christ.</p>
