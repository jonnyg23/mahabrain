 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xlii"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xlii-p0.1"></a>42. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xlii-p1"></a>The second petition is, THY KINGDOM COME. This contains nothing  new, and yet there is good reason for distinguishing it from the first. For if  we consider our lethargy in the greatest of all matters, we shall see how  necessary it is that what ought to be in itself perfectly known should be  inculcated at greater length. Therefore, after the injunction to pray that God  would reduce to order, and at length completely efface every stain which is  thrown on his sacred name, another petition, containing almost the same wish, is  added, viz., Thy kingdom come. Although a definition of this kingdom has already  been given, I now briefly repeat that God reigns when men, in denial of  themselves and contempt of the world and this earthly life, devote themselves to  righteousness and aspire to heaven (see Calvin, Harm. <a name="iii.xlii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#000">Matth. 6</a><a name="iii.xlii-p1.1"></a>). Thus this  kingdom consists of two parts; the first is, when God by the agency of his  Spirit corrects all the depraved lusts of the flesh, which in bands war against  Him; and the second, when he brings all our thoughts into obedience to his  authority. This petition, therefore, is duly presented only by those who begin  with themselves; in other words, who pray that they may be purified from all the  corruptions which disturb the tranquillity and impair the purity of God's  kingdom. Then as the word of God is like his royal sceptre, we are here enjoined  to pray that he would subdue all minds and hearts to voluntary obedience. This  is done when by the secret inspiration of his Spirit he displays the efficacy of  his word, and raises it to the place of honour which it deserves. We must next  descend to the wicked, who perversely and with desperate madness resist his  authority. God, therefore, sets up his kingdom, by humbling the whole world,  though in different ways, taming the wantonness of some, and breaking the  ungovernable pride of others. We should desire this to be done every day, in  order that God may gather churches to himself from all quarters of the world,  may extend and increase their numbers, enrich them with his gifts, establish due  order among them; on the other hand, beat down all the enemies of pure doctrine  and religion, dissipate their counsels, defeat their attempts. Hence it appears  that there is good ground for the precept which enjoins daily progress, for  human affairs are never so prosperous as when the impurities of vice are purged  away, and integrity flourishes in full vigour. The completion, however, is  deferred to the final advent of Christ, when, as Paul declares, "God will be all  in all" (<a name="iii.xlii-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#028">1 Corinthians 15:28</a><a name="iii.xlii-p1.2"></a>). This prayer, therefore, ought to withdraw us from the  corruptions of the world which separate us from God, and prevent his kingdom  from flourishing within us; secondly, it ought to inflame us with an ardent  desire for the mortification of the flesh; and, lastly, it ought to train us to  the endurance of the cross; since this is the way in which God would have his  kingdom to be advanced. It ought not to grieve us that the outward man decays  provided the inner man is renewed. For such is the nature of the kingdom of God,  that while we submit to his righteousness he makes us partakers of his glory.  This is the case when continually adding to his light and truth, by which the  lies and the darkness of Satan and his kingdom are dissipated, extinguished, and  destroyed, he protects his people, guides them aright by the agency of his  Spirit, and confirms them in perseverance; while, on the other hand, he  frustrates the impious conspiracies of his enemies, dissipates their wiles and  frauds, prevents their malice and curbs their petulance, until at length he  consume Antichrist "with the spirit of his mouth," and destroy all impiety "with  the brightness of his coming" (<a name="iii.xlii-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2002.htm#008">2 Thessalonians 2:8</a><a name="iii.xlii-p1.3"></a>, Calv. Comm.).</p>
