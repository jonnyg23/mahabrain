 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xxiv"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xxiv-p0.1"></a>24. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xxiv-p1"></a>They again object, Are those, then, to be deprived of every pious  wish, who, during the whole course of their lives, breathed nothing but piety  and mercy? I have no wish curiously to pry into what they do or meditate; but  the probability is, that instead of being subject to the impulse of various and  particular desires, they, with one fixed and immoveable will, long for the  kingdom of God, which consists not less in the destruction of the ungodly than  in the salvation of believers. If this be so, there cannot be a doubt that their  charity is confined to the communion of Christ's body, and extends no farther  than is compatible with the nature of that communion. But though I grant that in  this way they pray for us, they do not, however, lose their quiescence so as to  be distracted with earthly cares: far less are they, therefore, to be invoked by  us. Nor does it follow that such invocation is to be used because, while men are  alive upon the earth, they can mutually commend themselves to each other's  prayers. It serves to keep alive a feeling of charity when they, as it were,  share each other's wants, and bear each other's burdens. This they do by the  command of the Lord, and not without a promise, the two things of primary  importance in prayer. But all such reasons are inapplicable to the dead, with  whom the Lord, in withdrawing them from our society, has left us no means of  intercourse (<a name="iii.xxiv-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#005">Eccl. 9:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc009.htm#006">6</a><a name="iii.xxiv-p1.1"></a>), and to whom, so far as we can conjecture, he has  left no means of intercourse with us. But if any one allege that they certainly  must retain the same charity for us, as they are united with us in one faith,  who has revealed to us that they have ears capable of listening to the sounds of  our voice, or eyes clear enough to discern our necessities? Our opponents,  indeed, talk in the shade of their schools of some kind of light which beams  upon departed saints from the divine countenance, and in which, as in a mirror,  they, from their lofty abode, behold the affairs of men; but to affirm this with  the confidence which these men presume to use, is just to desire, by means of  the extravagant dreams of our own brain, and without any authority, to pry and  penetrate into the hidden judgments of God, and trample upon Scripture, which so  often declares that the wisdom of our flesh is at enmity with the wisdom of God,  utterly condemns the vanity of our mind, and humbling our reason, bids us look  only to the will of God.</p>
