 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Of Prayer</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iii.xv"></a> <h4 align="center"><a name="iii.xv-p0.1"></a>15. </h4> 
 <p><a name="iii.xv-p1"></a>Here, by way of objection, several questions are raised. Scripture  relates that God sometimes complied with certain prayers which had been dictated  by minds not duly calmed or regulated. It is true, that the cause for which  Jotham imprecated on the inhabitants of Shechem the disaster which afterwards  befell them was well founded; but still he was inflamed with anger and revenge  (<a name="iii.xv-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg009.htm#020">Judges 9:20</a><a name="iii.xv-p1.1"></a>); and hence God, by complying with the execration, seems to approve  of passionate impulses. Similar fervour also seized Samson, when he prayed,  " Strengthen me, I pray thee, only this once, O God, that I may be at once  avenged of the Philistines for my two eyes" (<a name="iii.xv-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg016.htm#028">Judges 16:28</a><a name="iii.xv-p1.2"></a>). For although there  was some mixture of good zeal, yet his ruling feeling was a fervid, and  therefore vicious longing for vengeance. God assents, and hence apparently it  might be inferred that prayers are effectual, though not framed in conformity to  the rule of the word. But I answer, <i>first</i>, that a perpetual law is not  abrogated by singular examples; and, <i>secondly</i>, that special suggestions  have sometimes been made to a few individuals, whose case thus becomes different  from that of the generality of men. For we should attend to the answer which our  Saviour gave to his disciples when they inconsiderately wished to imitate the  example of Elias, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye are of" (<a name="iii.xv-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#055">Luke 9:55</a><a name="iii.xv-p1.3"></a>). We  must, however, go farther and say, that the wishes to which God assents are not  always pleasing to him; but he assents, because it is necessary, by way of  example, to give clear evidence of the doctrine of Scripture, viz., that he  assists the miserable, and hears the groans of those who unjustly afflicted  implore his aid: and, accordingly, he executes his judgments when the complaints  of the needy, though in themselves unworthy of attention, ascend to him. For how  often, in inflicting punishment on the ungodly for cruelty, rapine, violence,  lust, and other crimes, in curbing audacity and fury, and also in overthrowing  tyrannical power, has he declared that he gives assistance to those who are  unworthily oppressed though they by addressing an unknown deity only beat the  air? There is one psalm which clearly teaches that prayers are not without  effect, though they do not penetrate to heaven by faith (<a name="iii.xv-p1.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#006">Ps. 107:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#013">13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#019">19</a><a name="iii.xv-p1.4"></a>). For  it enumerates the prayers which, by natural instinct, necessity extorts from  unbelievers not less than from believers, and to which it shows by the event,  that God is, notwithstanding, propitious. Is it to testify by such readiness to  hear that their prayers are agreeable to him? Nay; it is, first, to magnify or  display his mercy by the circumstance, that even the wishes of unbelievers are  not denied; and, secondly, to stimulate his true worshippers to more urgent  prayer, when they see that sometimes even the wailings of the ungodly are not  without avail. This, however, is no reason why believers should deviate from the  law divinely imposed upon them, or envy unbelievers, as if they gained much in  obtaining what they wished. We have observed (chap. iii. sec. 25), that in this  way God yielded to the feigned repentance of Ahab, that he might show how ready  he is to listen to his elect when, with true contrition, they seek his favour.  Accordingly, he upbraids the Jews, that shortly after experiencing his readiness  to listen to their prayers, they returned to their own perverse inclinations. It  is also plain from the Book of Judges that, whenever they wept, though their  tears were deceitful, they were delivered from the hands of their enemies.  Therefore, as God sends his sun indiscriminately on the evil and on the good, so  he despises not the tears of those who have a good cause, and whose sorrows are  deserving of relief. Meanwhile, though he hears them, it has no more to do with  salvation than the supply of food which he gives to other despisers of his  goodness.</p> 
 <p class="noindent"><a name="iii.xv-p2"></a>There seems to be a more difficult question concerning Abraham and Samuel,  the one of whom, without any instruction from the word of God, prayed in behalf  of the people of Sodom, and the other, contrary to an express prohibition,  prayed in behalf of Saul (<a name="iii.xv-p2.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen018.htm#023">Genesis 18:23</a><a name="iii.xv-p2.1"></a>; <a name="iii.xv-p2.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#011">1 Samuel 15:11</a><a name="iii.xv-p2.2"></a>). Similar is the case of  Jeremiah, who prayed that the city might not be destroyed (<a name="iii.xv-p2.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer032.htm#016">Jer. 32:16</a><a name="iii.xv-p2.3"></a>). It is  true their prayers were refused, but it seems harsh to affirm that they prayed  without faith. Modest readers will, I hope, be satisfied with this solution,  viz., that leaning to the general principle on which God enjoins us to be  merciful even to the unworthy, they were not altogether devoid of faith, though  in this particular instance their wish was disappointed. Augustine shrewdly  remarks, "How do the saints pray in faith when they ask from God contrary to  what he has decreed? Namely, because they pray according to his will, not his  hidden and immutable will, but that which he suggests to them, that he may hear  them in another manner; as he wisely distinguishes" (August. de Civit. Dei, Lib.  xxii. c. 2). This is truly said: for, in his incomprehensible counsel, he so  regulates events, that the prayers of the saints, though involving a mixture of  faith and error, are not in vain. And yet this no more sanctions imitation than  it excuses the saints themselves, who I deny not exceeded due bounds. Wherefore,  whenever no certain promise exists, our request to God must have a condition  annexed to it. Here we may refer to the prayer of David, "Awake for me to the  judgment that thou hast commanded" (<a name="iii.xv-p2.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#006">Psalm 7:6</a><a name="iii.xv-p2.4"></a>); for he reminds us that he had  received special instruction to pray for a temporal blessing. <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">6</font></a>
