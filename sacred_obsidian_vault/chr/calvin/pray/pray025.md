 <p><a name="iii.xxiii-p1"></a>In endeavouring to prove that such intercession derives some  support from Scripture they labour in vain. We frequently read (they say) of the  prayers of angels, and not only so, but the prayers of believers are said to be  carried into the presence of God by their hands. But if they would compare  saints who have departed this life with angels, it will be necessary to prove  that saints are ministering spirits, to whom has been delegated the office of  superintending our salvation, to whom has been assigned the province of guiding  us in all our ways, of encompassing, admonishing, and comforting us, of keeping  watch over us. All these are assigned to angels, but none of them to saints. How  preposterously they confound departed saints with angels is sufficiently  apparent from the many different offices by which Scripture distinguishes the  one from the other. No one unless admitted will presume to perform the office of  pleader before an earthly judge; whence then have worms such license as to  obtrude themselves on God as intercessors, while no such office has been  assigned them? God has been pleased to give angels the charge of our safety.  Hence they attend our sacred meetings, and the Church is to them a theatre in  which they behold the manifold wisdom of God (<a name="iii.xxiii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#010">Ephesians 3:10</a><a name="iii.xxiii-p1.1"></a>). Those who transfer to  others this office which is peculiar to them, certainly pervert and confound the  order which has been established by God and ought to be inviolable. With similar  dexterity they proceed to quote other passages. God said to Jeremiah, "Though  Moses and Samuel stood before me, yet my mind could not be toward this people"  (<a name="iii.xxiii-p1.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer015.htm#001">Jeremiah 15:1</a><a name="iii.xxiii-p1.2"></a>). How (they ask) could he have spoken thus of the dead but because he  knew that they interceded for the living? My inference, on the contrary, is  this: since it thus appears that neither Moses nor Samuel interceded for the  people of Israel, there was then no intercession for the dead. For who of the  saints can be supposed to labour for the salvation of the peoples while Moses  who, when in life, far surpassed all others in this matter, does nothing?  Therefore, if they persist in the paltry quibble, that the dead intercede for  the living, because the Lord said, "<i>If they stood before me</i>,"  (<i>intercesserint</i>), I will argue far more speciously in this way: Moses, of  whom it is said, "<i>if he interceded</i>," did not intercede for the people in  their extreme necessity: it is probable, therefore, that no other saint  intercedes, all being far behind Moses in humanity, goodness, and paternal  solicitude. Thus all they gain by their cavilling is to be wounded by the very  arms with which they deem themselves admirably protected. But it is very  ridiculous to wrest this simple sentence in this manner; for the Lord only  declares that he would not spare the iniquities of the people, though some Moses  or Samuel, to whose prayers he had shown himself so indulgent, should intercede  for them. This meaning is most clearly elicited from a similar passage in  Ezekiel: "Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, were in it, they should  deliver but their own souls by their righteousness, saith the Lord God" (<a name="iii.xxiii-p1.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze014.htm#014">Ezekiel 14:14</a><a name="iii.xxiii-p1.3"></a>). Here there can be no doubt that we are to understand the words as if it  had been said, If two of the persons named were again to come alive; for the  third was still living, namely, Daniel, who it is well known had then in the  bloom of youth given an incomparable display of piety. Let us therefore leave  out those whom Scripture declares to have completed their course. Accordingly,  when Paul speaks of David, he says not that by his prayers he assisted  posterity, but only that he "served his own generation" (<a name="iii.xxiii-p1.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#036">Acts 13:36</a><a name="iii.xxiii-p1.4"></a>).</p>
