 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN17"><a name="xxv-p1"></a>PSALM 90</p>  		
 <p><a name="xxv-p2"></a>As Moses is about to treat as well of the brevity and miseries of human life, as of the punishments inflicted upon the people of Israel, in order to minister some consolation for assuaging the grief and fear which the faithful might have entertained upon observing the operation of the common law, to which all mankind are subject, and especially, upon considering their own afflictions, he opens the psalm by speaking of the peculiar grace which God 		  had vouchsafed to his chosen tribes. He next briefly recites, how wretched the condition of men is, if they allow their hearts to rest in this world, especially when God summons them as guilty sinners to his judgment seat. And after he has bewailed, that even the children of Abraham had experienced for a time such severity, that they were almost consumed with sorrow, confiding in God’s free favor, by which He had adopted them to himself, he prays that He would deal towards them in a merciful 		  and gracious manner, as he had done in times past, and that he would continue even to the end the ordinary course of his grace.</p>  		
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent19"><a name="xxv-p3"></a>A Prayer of Moses, the man of God.</p>  		
 <p><a name="xxv-p4"></a>It is uncertain whether this psalm was composed by Moses, or whether some one of the prophets framed it into a song for the use of the people, from a formula of prayer written by Moses, and handed down from age to age. It is, however, highly probable, that it is not without some ground ascribed to Moses in the title; and since psalms were in use even in his time, I have no doubt that he was its author.  		   <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">562</font></a>
  		  Some maintain that the reason why his name appears in the inscription is, that it was sung by his posterity; but I cannot see why they should have recourse to such a groundless conceit. The epithet, <i>The man of God, </i>given to Moses, which is immediately added, clearly confutes them.  		   <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">563</font></a>
  		  This honorable designation is expressly applied to him, that his doctrine may have the greater authority. If conjectures are to be admitted, it is probable, that when the time of his death drew near, he endited this prayer to assuage the prolonged sorrow under which the people had almost pined away, and to comfort their hearts, under the accumulation of adversities with which they were oppressed. Although the wonderful goodness of God shone brightly in their deliverance from Egypt, 		  which, burying the miseries formerly endured by them, might have filled them with joy; yet we know that, soon after, it was extinguished by their ingratitude; so that for the space of not less than forty years, they were consumed with continual languor in the wilderness. It was therefore very seasonable for Moses at that time to beseech God that he would deal mercifully and gently with his people, according to the number of the years in which he had afflicted them.</p>  <a name="xxv.i"></a>

 <p><a name="xxv.i-p6"></a><b>1</b> <i> O Lord! thou hast been our dwelling-place.</i> In separating the seed of Abraham by special privilege from the rest of the human family, the Psalmist magnifies the grace of adoption, by which God had embraced them as his children. The object which he has in view in this exordium is, that God 			 would now renew the grace which he had displayed in old time towards the holy patriarchs, and continue it towards their offspring. Some commentators think that he alludes to the tabernacle, because in it the majesty of God was not less conspicuous than if he had dwelt in the midst of the people; but this seems to me to be altogether out of place. 			 He rather comprehends the whole time in which the Fathers sojourned in the land of Canaan. As the tabernacle had not yet continued for the space of forty years, the long duration here mentioned —<i> our dwelling-place from generation to generation</i> — would<i> 			 </i>not at all be applicable to it. It is not then intended to recount what God showed himself to be towards the Israelites from the time that he delivered them from Egypt; but what their fathers had experienced him to be in all ages, even from the beginning.   			  <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">565</font></a>
  			  Now it is declared that as they had always been pilgrims and wanderers, so God was to them instead of a dwelling-place. No doubt, the condition of all men is unstable upon earth; but we know that Abraham and his posterity were, above all others, sojourners, and as it were exiles. Since, then, they wandered in the land of Canaan till they were brought into Egypt, where they lived only by sufferance from day 			 to day, it was necessary for them to seek for themselves a dwelling-place under the shadow of God, without which they could hardly be accounted inhabitants of the world, since they continued everywhere strangers, and were afterwards led about through many windings and turnings. The grace which the Lord displayed in sustaining them in their wanderings, and shielding them with his hand when they 			 sojourned among savage and cruel nations, and were exposed to injurious treatment at their hands — this grace is extolled by Moses in very striking terms, when he represents God as an abode or dwelling-place to these poor fugitives who were continually wandering from one place to another in quest of lodgings. This grace he magnifies from the 			 length of time during which it had been exercised; for God ceased not to preserve and defend them for the space of more than four hundred years, during which time they dwelt under the wings of his protection.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.i-p9"></a><b>2</b>  <i>Before the mountains were brought forth.</i> Moses designs to set forth some high and hidden mystery, and yet he seems to speak feebly, 			 and, as it were, in a puerile manner. For who does not know that God existed before the world? This we grant is a truth which all men admit; but we will scarcely find one in a hundred who is thoroughly persuaded that God remains unchangeably the same. God is here contrasted with created beings, who, as all know, are subject to continual changes, so that there is nothing stable under heaven. As, in a particular manner, nothing is fuller of 			 vicissitude than human life, that men may not judge of the nature of God by their own fluctuating condition, he is here placed in a state of settled and undisturbed tranquillity. Thus the everlastingness of which Moses speaks is to be referred not only to the essence of God, but also to his providence, by which he governs the world. Although he 			 subjects the world to many alterations, he remains unmoved; and that not only in regard to himself, but also in regard to the faithful, who find from experience, that instead of being wavering, he is steadfast in his power, truth, righteousness, and goodness, even as he has been from the beginning. This eternal and unchangeable steadfastness of 			 God could not be perceived prior to the creation of the world, since there were as yet no eyes to be witnesses of it. But it may be gathered <i>a posteriori; </i>for while all things are subject to revolution and incessant vicissitude, his nature continues always the same. There may be also here a 			 contrast between him and all the false gods of the heathen, who have, by little and little, crept into the world in such vast numbers, through the error and folly of men. But I have already shown the object which Moses has in view, which is, that we mistake if we measure God by our own understanding; and that we must mount above the earth, yea, even above heaven itself, whenever we think upon him.</p>  <a name="xxv.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p2"></a><b>3.</b> Thou shalt turn man to destruction, and shalt say, Return, ye sons of Adam. <b>4.</b> For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday when it is gone, and as a watch in the night. <b>5.</b> Thou carriest them away as with a flood, they will be a sleep: in the morning he shall grow as grass: <b>6.</b> In the morning it shall flourish and grow: at the evening it shall be cut down, and shall wither. <b>7.</b> For we fail by thy anger, 				  and are affrighted by thy indignation. <b>8.</b> Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, and our secret sins in the light of thy countenance.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p5"></a><b>3</b>  <i>Thou shalt turn man to destruction.</i> Moses, in the first place, mentions how frail and transitory is the life of man, and bewails its miseries. This he does, not for the purpose of quarrelling with God, but as an argument to induce him the more readily to exercise his mercy, even as he is elsewhere said to pardon mortal men, when he considers of what they are made, and remembers that they are but dust and grass, (<a name="xxv.ii-p5.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa103.htm#014">Ps 103:14</a><a name="xxv.ii-p5.1"></a>.) he compares the course of our life to a ring or circle, because God, placing us upon the earth, turns us about within a narrow circuit, and when we have reached the last point, draws us back to himself in a moment. Others give a different interpretation, namely, that God leads men forth to death, and afterwards restores them at the resurrection. But this subtilty is far-fetched, and does not 			 harmonise with the context. We have here laid down a simple definition of our life, that it is, as it were, a short revolution in which we quickly complete our circle, the last point of which is the termination of our earthly course. This account of human life sets in a clearer light the gracious manner in which God deals with his servants, in adopting them to be his peculiar people, that he may at length gather them together into his 			 everlasting inheritance. Nor is it in vain that it is added, by way of contrast, (verse 4,) <i>that a thousand years in God’s sight are as yesterday</i> Although we are convinced from experience that men, when they have completed their circle, are forthwith taken out of the world, yet the knowledge of this frailty fails in making a deep impression upon our hearts, because we do not lift 			 our eyes above the world. Whence proceeds the great stupidity of men, who, bound fast to the present state of existence, proceed in the affairs of life as if they were to live two thousand years, but because they do not elevate their conceptions above visible objects? Each man, when he compares himself with others, flatters himself that he will live to a great age. In short, men are so dull as to think that thirty years, or even a smaller number, are, as it were, an eternity; nor are they impressed with the brevity of their life so long as this world keeps possession of their thoughts. This is the reason why Moses awakens us by elevating our minds to the eternity of God, without the consideration of which we perceive not how 			 speedily our life vanishes away. The imagination that we shall have a long life, resembles a profound sleep in which we are all benumbed, until meditation upon the heavenly life swallow up this foolish fancy respecting the length of our continuance upon earth.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p6"></a>As men are thus blinded, Moses sets before their view God as their judge. O Lord! as if he had said, if men would duly reflect upon that eternity from which thou beholdest these inconstant circlings of the world, they would not make so great account of the present life. But as, instead of seriously considering what is true duration, they rather wilfully turn away their eyes from heaven, this explains why they are so stupid, and look upon one 			 day as if it were a hundred years. Moses’ apostrophe to God is emphatic, implying that his patience being exhausted at seeing us so thoughtless, he addresses himself to God; and that it was labor to no purpose for him to speak to the deaf, who would not be taught that they were mortal, no, not even by the proofs of this, which experience was constantly presenting before them. This text is quoted by the Apostle Peter in a sense somewhat different, (<a name="xxv.ii-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#008">2Pe 3:8</a><a name="xxv.ii-p6.1"></a>,) while at the same time he does not pervert it, for he aptly and judiciously applies the testimony of Moses in illustration of the subject of which he is there treating. The design of Moses is to elevate the minds of men to heaven by withdrawing them from their own gross conceptions. And what is the object of Peter? As many, because Christ does not hasten his coming according to their desire, cast off the hope of the 			 resurrection through the weariness of long delay, he corrects this preposterous impatience by a very suitable remedy. He perceives men’s faith in the Divine promises fainting and failing, from their thinking that Christ delays his coming too long. Whence does this proceed, but because they grovel upon the earth? Peter therefore appropriately applies these words of Moses to cure this vice. As the indulgence in pleasures to which unbelievers yield themselves is to be traced to this, that having 			 their hearts too much set upon the world, they do not taste the pleasures of a celestial eternity; so impatience proceeds from the same source. Hence we learn the true use of this doctrine. To what is it owing that we have so great anxiety about our life, that nothing suffices us, and that we are continually molesting ourselves, but because we foolishly imagine that we shall nestle in this world for ever? Again, to what are we to ascribe that extreme fretfulness and impatience, which make our 			 hearts fail in waiting for the coming of Christ, but to their grovelling upon the earth? Let us learn then not to judge according to the understanding of the flesh, but to depend upon the judgment of God; and let us elevate our minds by faith, even to his heavenly throne, from which he declares that this earthly life is nothing. Nor does Moses simply contrast a thousand years with one day, but he contrasts them with <i>yesterday, </i>which is already gone; for whatever is still before our eyes 			 has a hold upon our minds, but we are less affected with the recollection of what is past. In regard to the word <i>watch, </i>the ancients, as is well known, were accustomed to divide the night into four watches, consisting of three hours each.  			  <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">566</font></a>
  			 To express still more forcibly how inconsiderable that which appears to us a long period is in God’s eyes, this similitude is added, That a thousand years in his sight differ nothing from three hours of the night, in which men scarcely know whether they are awake or asleep.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxv.ii-p8"></a><a name="xxv.ii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p9"></a><b>5</b>  <i>Thou carriest them away as with a flood.</i> Moses confirms what he had previously said, That men, so long as they are sojourners in this world, perform, as it were, a revolution which lasts only for a moment. I do not limit the expression to <i>carry away as with a flood</i> <i>to</i> calamities of a more grievous kind, but consider that death is simply compared in general to a flood; for when we have staid a little while in the world, we forthwith fall into the grave and are covered with earth. 			 Thus death, which is common to all, is with propriety called <i>an inundation. </i>While we are breathing the breath of life, the Lord overflows us by death, just as those who perish in a shipwreck are engulfed in the ocean; so that death may be fitly called an invisible deluge. And Moses affirms, that it is then evidently seen that men who flatter themselves that they are possessed of wonderful vigor 			 in their earthly course, are only as a sleep. The comparison of <i>grass </i>which is added, amounts to this, That men come forth in the morning as grass springs up, that they become green, or pass away within a short time, when being cut down, they wither and decay. The verbs in the 6th verse being in the singular number, it is better to connect them 			 with the word <i>grass. </i>But they may also be appropriately referred to each man; and as it makes little difference as to the sense of the text, whether we make <i>grass </i>or <i>each man </i>the nominative to the 			 verbs, I am not disposed to expend much labor upon the matter. This doctrine requires to be continually meditated upon; for although we all confess that nothing is more transitory than our life, yet each of us is soon carried away, as it were, by a frantic impulse to picture to his own imagination 			 an earthly immortality. Whoever bears in mind that he is mortal, restrains himself, that instead of having his attention and affections engrossed beyond measure with earthly objects, he may advance with haste to his mark. When we set no limit to our cares, we require to be urged forward by continual goadings, that we may not dream of a thousand 			 lives instead of one, which is but as a shadow that quickly vanishes away.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxv.ii-p10"></a><a name="xxv.ii-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p11"></a><b>7</b>  <i>For we fail by thy anger.</i> Moses makes mention of the anger of God advisedly; for it is necessary that men be touched with the feeling of this, in order to their considering in good earnest, what experience 			 constrains them to acknowledge, how soon they finish their course and pass away. He had, however, still another reason for joining together the brevity of human life and the anger of God. Whilst men are by nature so transitory, and, as it were, shadowy, the Israelites were afflicted by the hostile hand of God; and his anger is less supportable by our frail natures, which speedily vanish away, than it would be were we furnished with some 			 tolerable degree of strength.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxv.ii-p12"></a><a name="xxv.ii-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.ii-p13"></a><b>8</b>  <i>Thou hast set our iniquities before thee.</i> To show that by this complaint he is far from intending to murmur against God, he asserts that the Divine anger, however terrible it had been, was just, inasmuch as 			 the people had provoked it by their iniquities; for those who, when stricken by the Divine hand, are not brought to genuine humiliation, harden themselves more and more. The true way to profit, and also to subdue our pride, is to feel that He is a righteous judge. Accordingly Moses, after having 			 briefly taught that men by nature vanish away like smoke, gathers from thence that it is not to be wondered at if God exanimates and consumes those whom he pursues with his wrath. The manner of the expression by which God is described as showing the tokens of his anger is to be observed — <i>he sets the iniquities of men before his 			 eyes</i> Hence it follows, that whatever intermission of punishment we experience ought in justice to be ascribed to the forbearance of. God, who buries our sins that he may spare us. The word <a name="xxv.ii-p13.1"></a>עלומים, <i>alumim, 			 </i>which I have rendered <i>our secret sins, </i>is translated by some, <i>our youth;</i>   			  <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">567</font></a>
  			  as if Moses had said that the faults committed in youth are brought to remembrance. But this is too forced, and inconsistent with the scope of the passage; for it would destroy the contrast between <i>secret sins</i> and <i>the light 			 of God’s countenance, </i>by which Moses intimates that men hide themselves in darkness, and wrap themselves in many deceits, so long as God does not shine upon them with the light of his judgment; whereas, when he draws them back from their subterfuges, by which they endeavor to escape from him, and sets before his eyes the sins which they hide by hypocrisy, being subdued by fear and 			 dread, they are brought sincerely to humble themselves before him.</p>  <a name="xxv.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="xxv.iii-p7"></a><b>9.</b> <i>For all our days are passed away in thy indignation.</i> This might be viewed as a general confirmation of the preceding sentence, That the whole course of man’s life is suddenly brought to an end, as soon as God shows himself displeased. 			 But in my opinion Moses rather amplifies what he has said above concerning the rigour of God’s wrath, and his strict examination of every case in which he punishes sin. He asserts that this terror which God brought upon his people was not only for a short time, but that it was extended without intermission even to death. He complains that the Jews had almost wasted away by continual miseries; because God neither remitted nor mitigated his anger. 			 It is therefore not surprising to find him declaring that their years passed away like a <i>tale, </i>when God’s anger rested upon them so unremittingly.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xxv.iii-p8"></a><a name="xxv.iii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.iii-p9"></a><b>10.</b> <i>In the days of our years there are threescore years and ten.</i> He again returns to the general doctrine respecting the precariousness of the condition of men, although God may not openly display his wrath to terrify them. “What,” says he, “is the duration of life? Truly, if we reckon all our years, we will at length come to threescore and ten, or, if there be some who are stronger and more vigorous, they will bring us even to fourscore.” Moses uses the expression,<i> the days of our 			 years,</i> for the sake of emphasis; for when the time is divided into small portions, the very number itself deceives us, so that we flatter ourselves that life is long. With the view of overthrowing these vain delusions, he permits men to sum up the many thousand days   			  <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">570</font></a>
  			  which are in a few years; while he at the same time affirms that this great heap is soon brought to nothing. Let men then extend the space of their life as much as they please, by calculating that each year contains three hundred and sixty-five days; yet assuredly they will find that the term of seventy years is short. When they have made a lengthened calculation of the days, this is the sum in which the process 			 ultimately results. He who has reached the age of fourscore years hastens to the grave. Moses himself lived longer, (<a name="xxv.iii-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#007">De 34:7</a><a name="xxv.iii-p10.2"></a>,)   			  <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">571</font></a>
  			  and so perhaps did others in his time; but he speaks here of the ordinary term. And even then, those were accounted old men, and in a manner decrepit, who attained to the age of fourscore years; so that he justly declares that it is the robust only who arrive at that age. He puts <i>pride </i>for <i>the strength </i>or <i>excellence </i>of which men boast so highly. The sense is, that before men decline and come to old age, even in the very bloom of youth they are involved in many troubles, and that they cannot escape from the cares, weariness, sorrows, fears, griefs, inconveniences, and anxieties, to which this mortal life is subject. Moreover, this is to be referred to the whole course of our existence in the present state. And assuredly, he who considers what is the condition of our life from our infancy until we descend into the grave, will find troubles and turmoil in every part of it. The two Hebrew words <a name="xxv.iii-p11.3"></a>עמל, <i>amal, 			 </i>and <a name="xxv.iii-p11.4"></a>און, <i>aven, </i>which are joined together, are taken passively for <i>inconveniences </i>and <i>afflictions; </i>implying that the life of man is full of labor, and fraught with many torments, and that even at the time when men are 			 in the height of their pride. The reason which is added, <i>for it swiftly passes by, and we fly away, </i>seems hardly to suit the scope of the passage; for felicity may be brief, and yet on that account it does not cease to be felicity. But Moses means that men foolishly glory in their 			 excellence, since, whether they will or no, they are constrained to look to the time to come. And as soon as they open their eyes, they see that they are dragged and carried forward to death with rapid haste, and that their excellence is every moment vanishing away.</p>  <a name="xxv.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p6"></a><b>11.</b> <i>Who knoweth, the power of thy anger?</i> Moses again returns to speak of the peculiar afflictions of the Israelites; for he had also on this occasion complained before of the common frailty and miseries of mankind. He justly exclaims that 			 the power of God’s wrath is immeasurably great. So long as God withholds his hand, men wantonly leap about like runaway slaves, who are no longer afraid at the sight of their master; nor can their rebellious nature be reduced to obedience in any other way than by his striking them with the fear of his judgment. The meaning then is, that whilst God hides himself, and, so to speak, dissembles his 			 displeasure, men are inflated with pride, and rush upon sin with reckless impetuosity; but when they are compelled to feel how dreadful his wrath is, they forget their loftiness, and are reduced to nothing. What follows, <i>According to thy fear, so is thy wrath, </i>is commonly explained as denoting that the more 			 a man is inspired with reverence towards God, the more severely and sternly is he commonly dealt with; for “judgment begins at the house of God,” (<a name="xxv.iv-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1004.htm#017">1Pe 4:17</a><a name="xxv.iv-p6.1"></a>.) Whilst he pampers the reprobate with the good things of this life, he wastes his chosen ones with continual troubles; and in short, “whom he loveth he chasteneth,” (<a name="xxv.iv-p6.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#006">Heb 12:6</a><a name="xxv.iv-p6.2"></a>.) It is then a true and profitable doctrine that he deals more roughly with those who serve him than with the reprobate. But Moses, I think, has here a different meaning, which is, that it is a holy awe of God, and that alone, which makes us truly and deeply feel his anger. We see that the reprobate, although they are severely punished, only chafe upon the bit, or kick against God, or become exasperated, or are stupified, as if they 			 were hardened against all calamities; so far are they from being subdued. And though they are full of trouble, and cry aloud, yet the Divine anger does not so penetrate their hearts as to abate their pride and fierceness. The minds of the godly alone are wounded with the wrath of God; nor do they wait for his thunderbolts, to which the reprobate hold out their hard and iron necks, but they 			 tremble the very moment when God moves only his little finger. This I consider to be the true meaning of the prophet. He had said that the human mind could not sufficiently comprehend the dreadfulness of the Divine wrath. And we see how, although God shakes heaven and earth, many notwithstanding, like the giants of old, treat this with derision, and are actuated by such brutish arrogance, that they despise him when he brandishes his bolts. But 			 as the Psalmist is treating of a doctrine which properly belongs to true believers, he affirms that they have a strongly sensitive feeling of the wrath of God which makes them quietly submit themselves to his authority. Although to the wicked their own conscience is a tormentor which does not suffer them to enjoy repose, yet so far is this secret dread from teaching them to humble themselves, that it excites them to clamor against God with increasing frowardness. In short, the faithful alone are sensible of God’s wrath; and being subdued by it, they acknowledge that they are nothing, and with true humility devote themselves wholly to 			 Him. This is wisdom to which the reprobate cannot attain, because they cannot lay aside the pride with which they are inflated. They are not touched with the feeling of God’s wrath, because they do not stand in awe of him.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p8"></a><b>12.</b> <i>Teach us so to number our days.</i> Some translate to <i>the number of our days, </i>which gives the same sense. As Moses perceived that what he had hitherto taught is not comprehended by the 			 understandings of men until God shine upon them by his Spirit, he now sets himself to prayer. It indeed seems at first sight absurd to pray that we may know the number of our years. What? since even the strongest scarcely reach the age of fourscore years, is there any difficulty in reckoning up so small a sum? Children learn numbers as soon as they begin to prattle; and we do not need a teacher in arithmetic to enable us to count the length of a hundred upon our fingers. So much the fouler and more shameful is our stupidity in never comprehending the short term of our life. Even he who is most skillful in arithmetic, and who can precisely and accurately understand and investigate millions of millions, is nevertheless unable to count fourscore years in his own life. It is surely a monstrous thing that men can measure all distances without themselves, that they know how many feet the moon is distant from the center of the earth, what space there is between the different planets; and, in short, that they can measure all the dimensions both of heaven and earth; while yet they cannot number threescore and ten years in their own case. It is therefore evident that Moses had good 			 reason to beseech God for ability to perform what requires a wisdom which is very rare among mankind. The last clause of the verse is also worthy of special notice. By it he teaches us that we then truly apply our hearts to wisdom when we comprehend the shortness of human life. What can be a greater proof of madness than to ramble about without proposing to one’s self any end? True believers alone, who know the difference between this transitory state and a blessed eternity, for which they were created, know what ought to be the aim of their life. No man then can regulate his life with a settled mind, but he who, knowing the end of it, that is to say death itself, is led to consider the great purpose of man’s existence in this world, that he may aspire after the prize of the heavenly calling.</p>

 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p10"></a><b>13.</b> <i>Return, O Jehovah! how long?</i> After having spoken in the language of complaint, Moses adds a prayer, That God, who had not ceased for a long time severely to punish his people, would at length be inclined to deal gently with them. Although God daily gave them in many ways some taste of his love, yet their banishment from the land of promise was a very grievous affliction; for it admonished them that they were unworthy of that blessed inheritance which he had appointed for his children. They could not fail often to remember that dreadful oath which he had thundered out against them,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xxv.iv-p11"></a>“Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this wilderness,” <br> 			 (<a name="xxv.iv-p11.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#023">Num. 14:23</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#032">32</a><a name="xxv.iv-p11.2"></a>.)   			  <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">573</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.iv-p13"></a>Moses, no doubt, combines that sore bondage which they had suffered in Egypt with their wanderings in the wilderness; and therefore he justly bewails their protracted languishing in the words <i>how long? </i>As God is said to turn his back upon us, or to depart to a distance from us, when he withdraws the tokens of his favor, so by his return we are to understand the manifestation of his grace. The word <a name="xxv.iv-p13.1"></a>נחם, <i>nacham, </i>which we have translated <i>be pacified, </i>signifies 			 to <i>repent, </i>and may therefore not improperly be explained thus: Let it repent thee concerning thy servants. According to the not unfrequent and well known phraseology of Scripture, God is said to repent, when putting away men’s sorrow, and affording new ground of gladness, he appears as it were 			 to be changed. Those, however, seem to come nearer the mind of the Psalmist who translate, <i>Comfort thyself over thy servants; </i>for God, in cherishing us tenderly, takes no less pleasure in us than does a father in his own children. Now that is nothing else than to be pacified or propitious, as we 			 have translated it, to make the meaning the more obvious.</p>  <a name="xxv.v"></a>

 <p><a name="xxv.v-p6"></a><b>16</b>  <i>Let thy work appear towards thy servants.</i> As God, when he forsakes his Church, puts on as it were a character different from his own, Moses, with much propriety, calls the blessing of protection which had been divinely promised to the children of Abraham <i>God’s proper work. </i>Although, therefore, God’s work was manifest in all the instances in which he had punished the perfidiousness, ingratitude, obstinacy, unruly lusts, and unhallowed desires of his people, yet Moses, by way of eminence, prefers before all other proofs of God’s power, that care which he exercised in maintaining the welfare of the people, by which it was his will that 			 he should be principally known. This is the reason why Paul, in <a name="xxv.v-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#023">Ro 9:23</a><a name="xxv.v-p6.1"></a>, especially applies to the Divine goodness the honorable title of “glory.” God indeed maintains his glory by judging the world; but as nothing is more natural to him than to show himself gracious, his glory on that account is said to shine forth chiefly in his benefits. With respect to the present passage, God had then only begun to deliver his people; for they had still to be put in possession of the land of Canaan. Accordingly, had they gone no farther 			 than the wilderness, the lustre of their deliverance would have been obscured. Besides, Moses estimates the work of God according to the Divine promise; and doing this he affirms that it will be imperfect and incomplete, unless he continue his grace even to the end. This is expressed still more plainly in the second clause of the verse, in which he prays not only for the welfare of his own age, 			 but also for the welfare of the generation yet unborn. His exercise thus corresponds with the form of the covenant,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xxv.v-p7"></a>“And I will establish my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting covenants to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee,” <br> 			 (<a name="xxv.v-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#007">Ge 17:7</a><a name="xxv.v-p7.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxv.v-p8"></a>By this example we are taught, that in our prayers we ought to extend our care to those who are to come after us. As God has promised that the Church will be perpetuated even to the end of the world, — a subject which was brought 			 under our notice in the preceding psalm, — this ought, in a special manner, to lead us in all the prayers by which we commend the welfare of the Church to him, to include, at the same time, our posterity who are yet unborn. Farther, the words <i>glory</i> and <i>beauty </i>are to be particularly noticed: from which we learn that the love which God bears towards us is unparalleled. Although, in enriching us with his gifts he gains nothing for himself; yet he would have the splendor and beauty of his character manifested in dealing bountifully with us, as if his beauty were obscured when he ceases to do us good. In the clause immediately succeeding, 			 <i>Direct the work of our hands upon us,</i> Moses intimates that we cannot undertake or attempt anything with the prospect of success, unless God become our guide and counsellor, and govern us by his Spirit. Whence it follows, that the reason why the enterprises and efforts of worldly men have a disastrous issue is, because, in not following God, they pervert all order and throw 			 everything into confusion. Nor is the word <a name="xxv.v-p8.1"></a>עלינו, <i>alenu, upon us, </i>superfluous; for although God converts to good in the end whatever Satan and the reprobate plot and practice against him or his people; yet the Church, in which God rules with undisturbed sway, has in this respect a special 			 privilege. By his providence, which to us is incomprehensible, he directs his work in regard to the reprobate externally; but he governs his believing people internally by his Holy Spirit; and therefore he is properly said to order or direct the work of their hands. The repetition shows that a continual course of perseverance in the grace of God 			 is required. It would not be enough for us to be brought to the midst of our journey. He must enable us to complete the whole course. Some translate, <i>confirm </i>or <i>establish; </i>and this sense may be admitted. I have, however, followed that translation 			 which was more agreeable to the context, conceiving the prayer to be that God would direct to a prosperous issue all the actions and undertakings of his people.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xxv.iv-p3"></a> Moses, as we learn from the passage to which Calvin refers, “was an hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.” He was eighty years old when God made him captain of the chosen people; and Aaron was eighty-three years old before he was made High Priest, <a name="xxv.iv-p3.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo007.htm#007">Ex 7:7</a><a name="xxv.iv-p3.1"></a>. These, and a few other similar cases, have led many 						to conclude that the age of eighty was not considered at that time the age of decrepitude; and consequently that this psalm, which limits the average length of human life to seventy or eighty years, must be of a later date than the time of Moses. But this is no valid argument against his being its penman. According to Calvin, seventy or eighty years was at that time, in general, the utmost limits of human life; and the longevity of Moses and some others who exceeded that limit was an exception 						to the general rule. If this should be called in question, it might be observed that this psalm treats of the afflictions and brevity of life, not in reference to all men absolutely, but with respect to the Israelites in particular, who, on account of their murmuring at the report of the spies who had been sent to spy out the land of Canaan, and other sins, provoked God to swear in his wrath that the carcases of all that were numbered of them according to their whole number, from twenty years 						old and upwards, with the exception of Caleb and Joshua, should fall in the wilderness during the forty years of their wandering in it, (<a name="xxv.iv-p3.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num014.htm#027">Nu 14:27-29</a><a name="xxv.iv-p3.2"></a>.) Few of them, therefore, could have exceeded or even reached the age of fourscore years. It has been thought by some that at that time human life all over the world was reduced to the measure here specified, as its average standard. “The decree which 						abbreviated the life of man as a general rule to seventy or eighty years,” observes Dr J. M. Good, “was given as a chastisement upon the whole race of Israelites in the wilderness. It does not appear that the term of life was lengthened afterwards. Samuel died about seventy years old, David under seventy-one, and Solomon under sixty; and the history of the world shows that the abbreviation of life in other countries was nearly in the same proportion.”</p>
