 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="vi.iv.i-p25"></a><b>2. </b><i>Sanctify unto me all the first-born.</i> This also refers to the First Commandment, because God asserts His right over the first-born, lest the recollection of their redemption should ever be lost. For thus were the Israelites admonished that they must honor 				that God by whose grace they had escaped in safety from the common destruction of Egypt, and, moreover, that they were rescued by His special blessing, in order that they should consecrate themselves to God their Deliverer. For the offering which He here requires, was a mark of separation between them and the heathen nations.   				 <a name="fr_327"></a><a href="#fn_327"><font size="1">328</font></a>
  				 The first-born is called the opening of the womb, because it is the beginning of generation. The expression, “among the children of Israel,” when he is speaking of brutes, as well as of their own offspring and children, is meant to distinguish the wild beasts from the tame and domestic animals. But although He commands only the first-born of the race of Abraham to 				be offered to Him, still this must undoubtedly be extended to the sanctification of the whole people; for whilst He says, that the first-born were His, because they especially owed their preservation to His mercy, yet for the same reason he signifies that all were His own.</p>  			 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="vi.iv.i-p27"></a><a name="vi.iv.i-p27.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="vi.iv.i-p28"></a><b>11.</b> <i>And it shall be when the Lord shall bring thee.</i> He proceeds with what had been glanced at in the beginning of the chapter with respect to the consecration of the first-born, that in this way they should bear witness to the 				special blessing of God which preserved them when He destroyed the first-born of the Egyptians. But He commands the animals to   				 <a name="fr_328"></a><a href="#fn_328"><font size="1">329</font></a>
  				 be brought to Him, in order that they should be slain in the tabernacle. It is a common figure of speech to say, that the faithful and their gifts were placed in God’s sight when they entered the tabernacle. I conceive that they were ordered, in <a name="vi.iv.i-p29.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#030">Ex 22:30</a><a name="vi.iv.i-p29.1"></a>, to keep the first-born seven days, in order to 				prevent deceptions, because if the young had been earlier torn from the teats of their dams, and immediately delivered to the priests, the offering would have been useless. Yet I doubt not that the eighth day was chosen because it was the one prescribed for circumcision. An exception is added, that a price should be paid for an ass, the offering of which would have been unclean. With regard to their children, it was requisite that they should be 				redeemed, because they could not be offered in sacrifice, nor made priests.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.ii"></a>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="vi.iv.ii-p8"></a><b>19.</b> <i>All that openeth the matrix is mine.</i> He here defines what the offering was to be, viz., that they should redeem their children as well as the unclean animals at a price; but that they should bring into the tabernacle whatsoever could be offered in sacrifice. But God would not 				have their own sons consecrated to Him, because He had chosen the tribe of Levi, as we shall see elsewhere; they were therefore to remain free and in their own power after a pecuniary compensation. In the same way, unclean animals might be applied to domestic purposes, viz., after God’s price had been paid, since to Him they belonged, and He claimed them for Himself. But if any should not put so high a value on an ass or other unclean animal, the Law commanded that its neck should be broken; 				for otherwise it would have been sacrilege to reap profit from God’s property, or, what is the same, to transfer to their private use what God had adjudged to Himself.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.iii"></a>

 <p class="PAR-L-Main-Text09"><a name="vi.iv.iii-p6"></a><b>26.</b> <i>Only the firstling of the beasts.</i> Here a caution is interposed, that none should offer what is already the property of God. For since men are so greatly given to ostentation, and therefore in testifying their piety <i>whitewash 				two walls, </i>as the saying is, <i>out of the same pot, </i>God provides against this sin by forbidding the first-born to be offered to Him, since that would be to present stolen goods to Him. The sum is, that they should not, by consecrating to God what is already due to Him, steal from Him in their fictitious liberality what is consecrated and not their own. Nor let us be surprised at this law, because this ambition 				is almost natural to us all, to desire to lay God under obligation by the empty appearance of liberality, and therefore to seek for various grounds of boasting of religious duties, which, after all, are nought. And, undoubtedly, if this restraint had not been put upon the Jews, they would have aimed at the reputation of double zeal by this deceitful oblation, nor would they have scrupled, under the pretext of offering, to deprive God of what was 				His own.</p>  <a name="vi.iv.iv"></a>

God commands, therefore, that what was due to Him should be honestly and absolutely paid. But, if good laws sprang from evil habits, it hence appears with what audacious greediness men have ever been led away to wicked gains, since it was necessary that they should be prohibited by an express edict from seeking to enrich themselves at God’s expense. Wherefore, it is not to be wondered at that men are acute and sagacious in 				cheating each other, since they by no means hesitate to deceive God by wicked artifices.</p>
