 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p3"></a><b>1 </b>How sits solitary the city Which abounded in people I How is she become as a widow, Who was great among the nations! She who ruled among provinces Is become tributary!</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Weeping she has wept in the night And her tears are on her cheeks; She has no comforter All along all her lovers; All her friends have dealt falsely with her, They are become her enemies.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Migrated hath Judah because of oppression, And because of much servitude; She dwelleth among the nations, She finds no rest; All who pursued her have 	taken her between the straits.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>The ways of Sion mourn, For they come not to the festivals; All her gates are desolate, her priests are sighing; her virgins are afflicted, And she is in 	bitterness!</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Her adversaries have become the head, Her enemies have prospered; Because Jehovah hath afflicted her For the greatness of her iniquities: Her little ones have gone into exile<b> 	</b>Before the adversary;</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And departed from the daughter of Sion Has all her glory; her princes have become like harts, Who cannot find pasture; And they have gone without strength Before their pursuer.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Remember did Jerusalem, In the days of her affliction and want, All her desirable things, Which were from ancient days; When fall did her people into the hand of the enemy,<b> 	</b>And she had no helper: Seen her have enemies, They laughed at her Sabbath.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>A sin hath Jerusalem sinned, Therefore she is become a wandered; All who honored her have despised her, Because they have seen her nakedness; She even groaned, And turned backward:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Her shame is in her skirts; She remembered not her end; Therefore she came down wonderfully, She hath no comforter: See, Jehovah, my affliction, For magnified himself hath the enemy.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p12"></a><b>10 </b>His hand did the enemy stretch out To all her desirable things; For she saw the heathens, When they entered her sanctuary, Respecting whom thou hast commanded, They shall not come to thy 	congregation.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>All her people are sighing, They are seeking bread; They have given their desirable things For food, to restore life: See, Jehovah, and look, For I am 	vile.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>is it nothing to all of you Who pass by the way? Look and see, if there be a sorrow Like the sorrow that is come to me; For afflicted me hath Jehovah, In the day of the indignation of his wrath.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>From on high hath he sent fire into my bones And it hath prevailed over them: He hath spread his net for my feet, He hath turned me backward; He hath made me desolate,<b> 	</b>Sorrowing all the day.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Tied is the yoke of mine iniquities by his hand, They are twined together: They have come up on my neck, He hath weakened my strength: Given me up hath the Lord, Into the hand of my enemies, From whom I shall not be able to rise.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Trodden under foot all my valiant men Hath the Lord in the midst of me: He hath brought on me the fixed time To destroy my young men; The winepress hath the Lord trodden,<b> 	</b>As to the virgin, the daughter of Judah.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p18"></a><b>16 </b>For this I weep; mine eye mine eye! Waters flow down; For removed far from me is a comforter Who might revive my soul; My children are become desolate, For prevailed has the enemy.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Expand did Sion her hands, She had no comforter; Given a charge had Jehovah as to Jacob, To his adversaries all around him; Become is Jerusalem An abomination among them.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p20"></a><b>18 </b>Righteous is Jehovah, For his mouth have I provoked, Hear, I pray, all ye people, And behold my sorrow: My virgins and my young men, They are gone into 	captivity.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p21"></a><b>19 </b>I called to my friends, They deceived me; My priests and my elders, In the city they expired, While they were seeking food for themselves, To revive 	their soul.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p22"></a><b>20 </b>See, Jehovah, for I am distressed, My bowels are troubled; Overwhelmed is my heart within me, For rebelling I have rebelled: Without bereaves the sword, Within it is as death,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p23"></a><b>21 </b>They have heard that I mourn, That I have no comforter; All mine enemies have heard of my evil; They rejoice that thou hast done it, And brought the day thou hast announced:<b> 	</b>But they shall be as I am.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p24"></a><b>22 </b>Let all their wickedness Come into thy presence; And do to them as thou hast done To me for all my sins; For my sighings are many, And my heart is 	weak.</p>  <a name="iv.ii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Destroyed hath the Lord, and spared not, All the habitations of Jacob; He hath demolished in his indignation The fortresses of the daughter of Judah; He hath cast them to the ground, he hath 	profaned Her kingdom and her princes.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>He hath broken in the indignation of his wrath Every horn of Israel; He hath withdrawn his right hand From before the enemy; And he burned like fire in Jacob, The flame devoured all around.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Bent hath he his bow as an enemy, Stand did his right hand as an adversary, And he slew all the delights of the eye In the tabernacle of the daughter of Sion He hath poured forth<b> 	</b>As fire, his wrath.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>The Lord hath been like an enemy, He hath destroyed Israel; He hath destroyed all his palaces, He hath demolished his fortresses; He hath increased in the daughter of Judah<b> 	</b>Mourning and lamentation:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And he hath removed as a garden His tabernacle; He hath destroyed his testimony; Forgotten hath Jehovah in Sion The assembly and the Sabbath; He hath rejected, in the indignation of his 	wrath, The king and the priest:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Abhorred hath Jehovah his altar, He hath cast off his sanctuary; Given up hath he into the hand of the enemy The walls of her palaces: A noise they made in the house of Jehovah,<b> 	</b>As on the day of the assembly.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Resolve did Jehovah to destroy the wall Of the daughter of Sion; He extended a line, He drew not back his hand from scattering; Therefore mourned hath the rampart and the wall, They have fallen 	together.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Sunk have her gates in the ground; He hath destroyed and broken her bars; Her king and her princes, They are among the heathens; There is no law, her prophets, They find no vision from Jehovah:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>They sit on the ground, they are silent, The elders of the daughter of Sion; They cast dust on their head, They gird themselves with sackcloth; Bend to the ground their head<b> 	</b>Do the virgins of Jerusalem.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Consume with tears did mine eyes, Troubled were my bowels; Poured forth on the ground was my liver, For the breach of the daughter of my people; When the child and the suckling Vanished away in the 	streets of the city.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Thy prophets have seen for thee Vanity and insipidity. And they disclosed not thine iniquity, That they might reverse thy captivity; And they saw for thee Prophecies of vanity and expulsions.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Opened at thee their mouth Have all thine enemies; They hissed and gnashed the teeth, They said, “We shall devour her, Surely the day which we expected We have found, we have seen.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Jehovah hath done what he had purposed; He hath fulfilled his word, Which he had commanded from days of old; He hath overthrown and not spared; And tie hath made to rejoice over thee the 	enemy, He hath raised up the horn of thine adversaries.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>Cry out did their heart to the Lord: O wall of the daughter of Sion, Make tears to flow down As a river, day and night; Give thyself no rest, Let not 	the pupil of thine eye cease.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p22"></a><b>20 </b>See, Jehovah, and look, To whom thou hast done this: Should women eat their own fruit, Infants while nursed! Should they be slain in the Lord’s sanctuary, The priest and the prophet!</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p23"></a><b>21 </b>Lie on the ground in the streets Did boys and old men; My virgins and my young men, They fell by the sword: Thou hast killed in the day of thy wrath, Thou hast slaughtered and not spared.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p19"></a><b>17 </b>While we were yet standing, our eyes failed, As to our vain help; In our looking out we looked out To a nation that could not save us.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p20"></a><b>18 </b>They hunted our steps, So that we could not walk in our streets; Draw near did our end, fulfilled were our days, Surely come did our end.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Swifter were our pursuers Than the eagles of heaven; On the mountains they followed us, They lay in wait for us in the desert.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p22"></a><b>20 </b>The spirit of our nostrils, the anointer of Jehovah, Was taken in their snares; Of whom we said, “Under his shadow We shall live among the nations.”</p>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Remember, O Jehovah, what has come to us; Look, and see our reproach:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Our heritage is turned over to foreigners, Our houses to aliens.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Orphans are we become, without a father; Our mothers are as widows.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Our own water, for money we drink; Our own wood, for a price it comes to us.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p7"></a><b>5 </b>On our necks have we suffered persecution; We have labored, and had no rest.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p8"></a><b>6 </b>To the Egyptians we extended the hand, To the Assyrians, to be satisfied with bread.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Our fathers sinned, and are not; And we their iniquities have borne.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Servants have ruled over us; None delivered from their hands.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p11"></a><b>9 </b>With our life have we procured our bread, Because of the drought of the desert.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p12"></a><b>10 </b>Our skins are like an oven black, Because of the burnings of famine.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Women in Sion have been ravished, Virgins in the cities of Judah.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Princes by their own hand were hung, The faces of elders were not honored.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Young men they took to grind, And boys under the wood fell.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Eiders ceased from the gate, Young men from their music.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Ceased has the joy of our heart, Turned into mourning has our dance.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Fallen has the crown of our head; Woe now to us, for we have sinned!</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Therefore faint is our heart; For this darkener! are our eyes,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p20"></a><b>18 </b>Even for mount Sion, which is desolate; Foxes pass through it.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Thou Jehovah for ever sittest, Thy throne is through all ages.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Why shouldest thou perpetually forget us, And forsake us for ever.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p23"></a><b>21 </b>Turn us, Jehovah, to thee, and we shall be turned; Renew our days as of old;</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.v-p24"></a><b>22 </b>Except thou hast wholly rejected us, And hast become very angry with us.</p>
