 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Concerning Moab: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, — Woe upon Nebo! for it is laid waste, Ashamed, taken is Kiriathaim; Ashamed is Misgab and dismayed.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>No more shall be the boasting of Moab over Heshbon; They have consulted an evil against her, — “Come and let us cut her off from being a nation.” Also Madmen, thou shalt be cut off, After thee shall go the sword.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>The sound of a cry from Horonaim! A waste and great destruction!</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Distressed is Moab; A cry have her little ones made to be heard.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>For in the ascent to Luhith, With weeping shall ascend weeping; For in the descent to Horonaim, The enemies a cry of distress shall hear:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>Flee ye, save your lives; And ye shall be as the juniper in the desert,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Therefore, because thy confidence Was in thy works and in thy treasures, Even thou shalt be taken: And go forth shall Chemosh into captivity, His priests and his princes together.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>And come shall a waster to every city, Nor shall a city escape; Perish also shall the valley, And destroyed shall be the plain, As Jehovah hath spoken.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Give wings to Moab, For flying she shall fly, And her cities shall be a waste, That there will be none to inhabit them.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p12"></a><b>10 </b>Cursed is he who doeth the work of Jehovah deceitfully, And cursed is he who restrains his sword from blood.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Quiet has been Moab from his childhood, And hath settled on his dregs, And hath not been changed from vessel to vessel, And to captivity he hath not gone: Therefore remained has his flavor in him, And his odor was not changed.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Therefore, behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will send to him drivers, Who will drive him out; And his vessels will they empty, And his bottles will they scatter:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>And ashamed will be Moab of Chemosh, As ashamed was the house of Israel of Bethel, The object of their confidence.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p16"></a><b>14 </b>How say ye, “We are valiant, and men strong for war:”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Wasted is Moab, and from his cities they have vanished, And his young men have descended to the slaughter, Saith the King, Jehovah of hosts is his name.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Nigh is the destruction of Moab to come, And her calamity greatly hastens. Be ye moved for him all who are around him, And all ye who know his name, say, — “How has the strong staff been broken, the beautiful rod!”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Come down from glory, and dwell in thirst, Thou inhabitant, the daughter of Dibon!</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p20"></a><b>18 </b>For the waster of Moab comes up against thee, The destroyer of thy fortresses.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p21"></a><b>19 </b>On the way stand and look, Thou inhabitant of Aroer. Ask the fugitive, and her who has escaped, “Say, what hath happened?”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Ashamed is Moab, for he is broken. Howl ye, and cry out, And proclaim in Arnon that Moab is laid waste.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p23"></a><b>21 </b>Judgment also shall come on the plain country, On Holon, and on Jahazah, and on Mephaath,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p24"></a><b>22 </b>And on Dibon, and on Nebo, and on Beth-diblathaim,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p25"></a><b>23 </b>And on Kiriathaim, and on Beth-gamul, and on Beth-meon,</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p26"></a><b>24 </b>And on Kerioth, and on Bozrah, And on all the cities of the land of Moab, far and near</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p27"></a><b>25 </b>Cut, off is the horn of Moab, And his strength is broken, saith Jehovah.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p28"></a><b>26 </b>Make him drunk, for against Jehovah hath he magnified him- self; And roll himself shall Moab in his own vomit; And he also shall be a derision;</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p29"></a><b>27 </b>For has not Israel been a derision to thee? Has he been found among thieves? For since thou hast spoken of him, thou hast been excited.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p30"></a><b>28 </b>Leave the cities, and dwell in the rock, Ye inhabitants of Moab: And they shall be as a dove, Which makes a nest in the passages, Beyond the mouth of the cleft.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p31"></a><b>29 </b>Heard have we of the pride of Moab; Very proud is his haughtiness, And his pride, and the loftiness of his heart.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p32"></a><b>30 </b>I know, saith Jehovah, his insolence, And his lies are not stable they shall not do so</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p33"></a><b>31 </b>Therefore for Moab will I howl, And to all Moab will I cry aloud; I will mutter to the men of the city of potsherd.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p34"></a><b>32 </b>With the weeping of Jazer Will I weep for thee, vine of Sibmah: Thy shoots have passed over the sea, Even to the sea came Jazer: On thy summer-fruits and on thy vintages Has fallen a waster.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p35"></a><b>33 </b>And taken away shall be joy and exultation, From the fruitful field, from the land of Moab; And the wine from the presses will I make to cease: He will not tread with shouting, shouting, There will not be shouting.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p36"></a><b>34 </b>At the cry of Heshbon, to Elealeh, to Jahaz, Will they send forth their voice, From Zoar to Horonaim; An heifer three years old <i>is Moab; </i>Verily even the waters of Nimrim shall be dried up.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p37"></a><b>35 </b>And I will cause to cease from Moab, saith Jehovah, Him who offers on the high place, And who burns incense to his gods</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p38"></a><b>36 </b>Therefore my heart for Moab Shall make a sound like pipes, And my heart for the men of the city of potsherd Like pipes shall make a sound; For the treasures he had made have perished.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p39"></a><b>37 </b>For on every head <i>shall be </i>baldness, And to every beard, a shaving, And on all hands, incisions, and on loins, sackcloth.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p40"></a><b>38 </b>On all the roofs of Moab, And in all her streets, shall be mourning altogether; For I will break Moab like a vessel In which there is no pleasure, saith Jehovah.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p41"></a><b>39 </b>How Moab is broken! they will howl; How has he turned his back! he is ashamed: Yea, Moab is become a derision, And a terror to all around.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p42"></a><b>40 </b>For thus saith Jehovah, — Behold, as an eagle will he fly, And extend his wings over Moab:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p43"></a><b>41 </b>Taken are the cities, the strongholds are seized, And the heart of the men of Moab shall be in that day As the heart of a woman in distress.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p44"></a><b>42 </b>And broken shall Moab be, so as not to be a people, Because against Jehovah hath he exalted himself.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p45"></a><b>43 </b>Terror, and the pit, and the snare, <i>shall be </i>on thee, Inhabitant of Moab, saith Jehovah:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p46"></a><b>44 </b>He who flies from terror shall fall into the pit, And he who ascends from the pit shall be taken in the snare; For I will bring upon her, upon Moab, The year of their visitation, saith Jehovah.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p47"></a><b>45 </b>Under the shadow of Heshbon shall they stand, Who from violence shall flee: But fire shall go forth from Heshbon, And a flame from the midst of Sihon; And it shall consume the corner of Moab, And the extremities of the sons of tumult.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p48"></a><b>46 </b>Woe to thee, Moab! Perished have the people of Chemosh! For driven have been thy sons into captivity, And thy daughters into exile.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.i-p49"></a><b>47 </b>But I will restore the captivity of Moab In the latter days, saith Jehovah. Thus far the judgment of Moab.</p>  <a name="iv.i.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Concerning the children of Ammon: Thus saith Jehovah, — Hath Israel no children? hath he no heir? Why doth their king inherit Gad, And his people dwell in its cities?</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Therefore, behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will cause to be heard the trumpet of war At Rabbah, of the children of Ammon; And she shall be a heap of desolation, And her daughters shall be burned with fire, And possess his possessors shall Israel, saith Jehovah.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Howl thou, Heshbon, for laid waste is Ai; Cry aloud, ye daughters of Rabbah. Gird on sackcloth, lament, Run here and there by the fences; For their king, into captivity is he gone, And his priests and his princes with him.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Why gloriest thou in thy deep valleys? Flown down has thy valley, rebellious daughter! Who trusted in her hidden places, Saying, Who can come to me?</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Behold, I will bring on thee terror, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, from all around thee; And ye shall be driven out, each one before him, And there will be none to gather the dispersed.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>But I will afterwards restore The captivity of the children of Ammon, saith Jehovah.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Concerning Edom: Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, — Is there not wisdom any more in Teman? Has counsel perished from the intelligent? Overflowing has been their wisdom!</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Flee, ye inhabitants of Dedan, Who have turned <i>and </i>made deep <i>your </i>dwelling; For the ruin of Esau will I bring on him, At the time of his visitation.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>If vintagers had come to thee, Would they not have left some grapes? If thieves in the night, would they not have destroyed What would suffice them?</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>But I will uncover Esau, I will disclose his hidden things, So that he cannot be concealed: Plundered shall be his seed, And his brethren and his neighbors; And he shall be no more.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Leave thy orphans, I will nourish them; And thy widows, let them trust in me.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>For thus saith Jehovah, — Behold, those to whom it was not their judgment To drink the cup, shall surely drink, And shalt thou be exempted? Thou shalt not be exempted, For drinking thou shalt drink it.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>For I have by myself sworn, saith Jehovah, That a waste, a reproach, a desert, And a curse, shall Bozrah become; And all her cities shall be perpetual wastes.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>A hearing have we heard from Jehovah, And a messenger to the nations has been sent, — “Be ye gathered and come against her, And rise ye up to the battle.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>For behold, small made I thee among the nations, Contemptible among men:</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Deceived thee has thy terror, the pride of thine heart; Thou who dwellest in the fissures of rocks, Who occupiest the heights of mountains: Though thou raisest high, as an eagle, thy nest, Thence will I draw thee down, saith Jehovah.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>And Edom shall become a waste; Every one passing by her shall be astonished, And shall hiss on account of all her strokes.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>As in the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah And of their neighboring cities, saith Jehovah, Dwell there shall no man, Nor shall a son of man abide there.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Behold, as a lion from the swelling of Jordan, Will he ascend to the habitation of strength: After having made him to rest, I will make him flee from her; And who is the chosen one whom I shall set over her? For who is as I am? And who will protest against me? And who is the shepherd that before me will stand?</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Therefore, hear ye the counsel of Jehovah, Which he hath counseled against Edom, And his thoughts which he hath thought Against the inhabitants of Teman; Surely draw them forth shall the least of the flock, Surely destroyed over them shall be their dwellings.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p23"></a><b>21 </b>At the sound of their fall, tremble shall the earth, The cry of their voice shall at the Red Sea be heard.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p25"></a><b>23 </b>Concerning Damascus: Ashamed is Hamath and Arpad; Because they heard a bad report, they melt away, Like a turbulent sea which cannot rest.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p26"></a><b>24 </b>Weakened is Damascus, she turns to flight, Terror hath laid hold on her, Anguish and pangs have seized her, As a woman in travail.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p30"></a><b>28 </b>Concerning Kedar, and the kingdoms of Hazor, which Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, had smitten: Thus saith Jehovah, — Arise ye, ascend against Kedar, And destroy the children of the east.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p31"></a><b>29 </b>Their tents and their flocks shall they take away, And their curtains and all their vessels; Their camels also shall they take to themselves, And they shall cry to them, “Terror <i>is </i>on every side.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p32"></a><b>30 </b>Flee ye, depart far away, (Though deep have they made to dwell The inhabitants of Hazor, saith Jehovah;) For consulted against you hath Nebuchadnezzar, The king of Babylon, a counsel, And he hath purposed against you a purpose.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p33"></a><b>31 </b>Arise ye, ascend against a secure nation, That dwelleth in confidence, saith Jehovah; It hath neither gates nor bars, it dwelleth alone.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p34"></a><b>32 </b>And their camels shall became a prey, And the abundance of their cattle a plunder; And I will scatter them to every wind, <i>Even </i>the utmost corners; And from all the sides thereof Will I bring their destruction, saith Jehovah.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p36"></a><b>34 </b>The word which came to Jeremiah, the prophet, against Elam, at the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, the king of Judah, saying:</p>

 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p39"></a><b>37 </b>For I will terrify Elam before their enemies, And before those who seek their life; And I will bring on them the evil Of the indignation of my wrath, saith Jehovah; And I will send after them the sword Until I shall have consumed them;</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iv.i.ii-p40"></a><b>38 </b>And I will erect my throne in Elam, And destroy thence the king and the princes, saith Jehovah.</p>
