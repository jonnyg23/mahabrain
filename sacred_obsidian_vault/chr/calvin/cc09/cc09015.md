 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN13"><a name="xvi-p1"></a>PSALM 50</p>  		
 <p><a name="xvi-p2"></a>There have always been hypocrites in the Church, men who have placed religion in a mere observance of outward ceremonies, and among the Jews there were many who turned their attention entirely to the figures of the Law, without regarding the truth which was represented under them. They conceived that nothing more was demanded of them but their sacrifices and other rites. The following psalm is occupied with the reprehension of this gross error, and 		  the prophet exposes in severe terms the dishonor which is cast upon the name of God by confounding ceremony with religion, showing that the worship of God is spiritual, and consists of two parts, prayer and thanksgiving.</p>

 </p>  		
 <p><a name="xvi-p5"></a>The prophet holds up the ingratitude of such persons to our reprobation, as proving themselves unworthy of the honor which has been placed upon them, and debasing themselves by a degenerate use of this world. From this let us learn, that if we are miserable here, it must be by our own fault; for could we discern and properly improve the many mercies which God has bestowed upon us, we would not want, even on earth, a foretaste of eternal 		  blessedness. Of this, however we fall short through our corruption. The wicked, even while on earth, have a pre-eminency over the beasts of the field in reason and intelligence, which form a part of the image of God; but in reference to the end which awaits them the prophet puts both upon a level, and declares, that being divested of all their vain-glory, they will eventually perish like the beasts. Their souls will indeed survive, but it is not the less true that death will consign them to 		  everlasting disgrace.</p>  <a name="xvi.i"></a>

  			  <i>hath spoken</i> The inscription of this psalm bears the name of Asaph; but whether he was the author of it, or merely received it as chief singer from the hand of David, cannot be known. This, however, is a matter of little consequence. The opinion has been very generally entertained, that the psalm points to the period of the Church’s renovation, and that 			 the design of the prophet is to apprise the Jews of the coming abrogation of their figurative worship under the Law. That the Jews were subjected to the rudiments of the world, which continued till the Church’s majority, and the arrival of what the apostle calls “the fullness of times,” (<a name="xvi.i-p8.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#004">Ga 4:4</a><a name="xvi.i-p8.8"></a>,) admits of no doubt; the only question is, whether the prophet must here be considered 			 as addressing the men of his own age, and simply condemning the abuse and corruption of the legal worship, or as predicting the future kingdom of Christ? From the scope of the psalm, it is sufficiently apparent that the prophet does in fact interpret the Law to his contemporaries, with a view of showing them that the ceremonies, while they existed, were of no importance whatever by themselves, or otherwise than connected with a higher meaning. Is it objected, that God never called the whole 			 world except upon the promulgation of the Gospel, and that the doctrine of the Law was addressed only to one peculiar people? the answer is obvious, that the prophet in this place describes the whole world as convened not for the purpose of receiving one common system of faith, but of hearing God plead his cause with the Jews in its presence. The appeal is of a parallel nature with others which we find in Scripture:</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p9"></a>“Give ear, O ye heavens! and I will speak; and hear, O earth! the words of my mouths” (<a name="xvi.i-p9.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu032.htm#001">De 32:1</a><a name="xvi.i-p9.1"></a>;)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p10"></a>or as in another place,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p11"></a>“I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I have set before you life and death,” (<a name="xvi.i-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu030.htm#019">De 30:19</a><a name="xvi.i-p11.1"></a>;)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p12"></a>and again Isaiah,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.i-p13"></a>“Hear, O heaven! and give ear, O earth! for the Lord hath spoken,” (<a name="xvi.i-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002">Isa 1:2</a><a name="xvi.i-p13.1"></a>.)   			  <a name="fr_241"></a><a href="#fn_241"><font size="1">242</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p15"></a>This vehement mode of address was required in speaking to hypocrites, that they might be roused from their complacent security, and their serious attention engaged to the message of God. The Jews had special need to be awakened upon the point to which reference is here made. Men are naturally disposed to outward show in religion, and, measuring God by themselves, imagine that an attention to ceremonies constitutes the sum of 			 their duty. There was a strong disposition among the Jews to rest in an observance of the figures of the Law, and it is well known with what severity the prophets all along reprehended this superstition, by which the worst and most abandoned characters were led to arrogate a claim to piety, and hide their abominations under the specious garb of godliness. The prophet, therefore, required to do more than simply expose the defective nature of that worship which withdraws the attention of men from 			 faith and holiness of heart to outward ceremonies; it was necessary that, in order to check false confidence and banish insensibility, he should adopt the style of severe reproof. God is here represented as citing all the nations of the earth to his tribunal, not with the view of prescribing the rule of piety to an assembled world, or collecting a church for his service, but with the design of alarming the hypocrite, and terrifying him out of his self-complacency. It would serve as a spur to 			 conviction, thus to be made aware that the whole world was summoned as a witness to their dissimulation, and that they would be stripped of that pretended piety of which they were disposed to boast. It is with a similar object that he addresses Jehovah as <i>the God of gods, </i>to possess their minds with a salutary terror, and dissuade them from their vain attempts to elude his 			 knowledge. That this is his design will be made still more apparent from the remaining context, where we are presented with a formidable description of the majesty of God, intended to convince the hypocrite of the vanity of those childish trifles with which he would evade the scrutiny of so great and so strict a judge.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p16"></a>To obviate an objection which might be raised against his doctrine in this psalm, that it was subversive of the worship prescribed by Moses, the prophet intimates that this judgment which he announced would be in harmony with the Law. When God speaks <i>out of Zion</i> he necessarily sanctions the authority of the Law; 			 and the Prophets, when at any time they make use of this form of speech, declare themselves to be interpreters of the Law. That holy mountain was not chosen of man’s caprice, and therefore stands identified with the Law. The prophet thus cuts off any pretext which the Jews might allege to evade his doctrine, by announcing that such as concealed their wickedness, under the specious covert of ceremonies, would not be condemned of God by any new code of religion, but by that which was ministered 			 originally by Moses. He gives Zion the honorable name of <i>the perfection of beauty, </i>because God had chosen it for his sanctuary, the place where his name should be invoked, and where his glory should be manifested in the doctrine of the Law.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p17"></a><a name="xvi.i-p17.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p18"></a><b>3.</b> <i>Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence</i>    			  <a name="fr_242"></a><a href="#fn_242"><font size="1">243</font></a>
  			  He repeats that God would come, in order to confirm his doctrine, and more effectually arouse them. He would come, and should not always keep silence, lest they should be encouraged to presume upon his forbearance. Two reasons may be assigned why the prophet calls God <i>our God</i> He may be considered as setting himself, and the 			 comparatively small number of the true fearers of the Lord, in opposition to the hypocrites whom he abhors, claiming God to be his God, and not theirs, as they were disposed to boast; or rather, he speaks as one of the people, and declares that the God who was coming to avenge the corruptions of his worship was the same God whom all the children of Abraham professed to serve. He who shall come, as if he had said, is our God, the same in whom we glory, who established his covenant with Abraham, 			 and gave us his Law by the hand of Moses. He adds, that God would come with <i>fire</i> and <i>tempest, </i>in order to awaken a salutary fear in the secure hearts of the Jews, that they might learn to tremble at the judgments of God, which they had hitherto regarded with indifference and despised, and in 			 allusion to the awful manifestation which God made of himself from Sinai, (<a name="xvi.i-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#016">Ex 19:16</a><a name="xvi.i-p19.1"></a>; see also <a name="xvi.i-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#018">Heb 12:18</a><a name="xvi.i-p19.2"></a>.) The air upon that occasion resounded with thunders and the noise of trumpets, the heavens were illuminated with lightnings, and the mountain was in flames, it being 			 the design of God to procure a reverential submission to the Law which he announced. And it is here intimated, that God would make a similarly terrific display of his power, in coming to avenge the gross abuses of his holy religion.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p20"></a><a name="xvi.i-p20.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p21"></a><b>4.</b> <i>He shall call to the heavens from above</i> It is plain from this verse for what purpose God, as he had already announced, would call upon the earth. This was to witness the settlement of his controversy with his own people the Jews, against whom judgment was to be pronounced, not in the 			 ordinary manner as by his prophets, but with great solemnity before the whole world. The prophet warns the hypocritical that they must prepare to be driven from their hiding-place, that their cause would be decided in the presence of men and angels, and that they would he dragged without excuse before that dreadful assembly. It may be asked, why the prophet represents the true fearers of the Lord as cited to his bar, when it is evident that the remonstrance which follows in the psalm is 			 addressed to the hypocritical and degenerate portion of the Jews? To this I answer, that God here speaks of the whole Church, for though a great part of the race of Abraham had declined from the piety of their ancestors, yet he has a respect to the Jewish Church, as being his own institution. He speaks of them as <i>his meek ones, </i>to remind them of what they ought to be in consistency 			 with their calling, and not as if they were all without exception patterns of godliness. The form of the address conveys a rebuke to those amongst them whose real character was far from corresponding with their profession. Others have suggested a more refined interpretation, as if the meaning were, Separate the small number of my sincere worshippers from the promiscuous multitude by whom my name is profaned, lest they too should afterwards be seduced to a vain religion of outward form. I do not 			 deny that this agrees with the scope of the prophet. But I see no reason why a church, however universally corrupted, provided it contain a few godly members, should not be denominated, in honor of this remnant, the holy people of God. Interpreters have differed upon the last clause of the verse: <i>Those who strike a covenant with me over sacrifices, </i>Some think <i>over</i> is put for <i>besides, </i>or <i>beyond, </i>and that God commends his true servants for this, that they acknowledged something more to be required in his covenant than an observance of outward ceremonies, and were not chargeable with resting in the carnal figures of the Law.   			  <a name="fr_243"></a><a href="#fn_243"><font size="1">244</font></a>
  			  Others think that the spiritual and true worship of God is here directly opposed to sacrifices; as if it had been said, Those who, instead of sacrifices, keep my covenant in the right and appointed manner, by yielding to me the sincere homage of their heart. But in my opinion, the prophet is here to be viewed as pointing out with commendation the true and genuine use of the legal worship; for it was of the utmost consequence that it should be known what was the real 			 end for which God appointed sacrifices under the Law. The prophet here declares that sacrifices were of no value whatever except as seals of God’s covenant, an interpretative handwriting of submission to it, or in general as means employed for ratifying it. There is an allusion to the custom then universally prevalent of interposing sacrifices, that covenants might be made more solemn, and be more religiously observed.   			  <a name="fr_244"></a><a href="#fn_244"><font size="1">245</font></a>
  			  In like manner, the design with which sacrifices were instituted by God was to bind his people more closely to himself, and to ratify and confirm his covenant. The passage is well worthy of our particular notice, as defining those who are to be considered the true members of the Church. They are such, on the one hand, as are characterised by the spirit of meekness, practising righteousness in their intercourse with the world; and such, on the other, as close in the 			 exercise of a genuine faith with the covenant of adoption which God has proposed to them. This forms the true worship of God, as he has himself delivered it to us from heaven; and those who decline from it, whatever pretensions they may make to be considered a church of God, are excommunicated from it by the Holy Spirit. As to sacrifices or other ceremonies, they are of no value, except in so far as they seal to us the pure truth of God. All such rites, consequently, as have no foundation in 			 the word of God, are unauthorised, and that worship which has not a distinct reference to the word is but a corruption of things sacred.</p>  <a name="xvi.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p6"></a><b>6.</b> <i>And the heavens shall declare his righteousness.</i> The Jews were vain enough to imagine that their idle and fantastic service was the perfection of righteousness; but they are here warned by the prophet, that God, who had seemed to connive at their folly, was about to reveal his own 			 righteousness from heaven, and expose their miserable devices. “Think you,” as if he had said, “that God can take delight in the mockery of your deluded services? Though you send up the smoke of them to heaven, God will make known his righteousness in due time from above, and vindicate it from the dishonors done to it by your wicked inventions. The heavens themselves will attest your perfidy in despising true holiness, and corrupting the pure worship of God. He will no longer suffer your 			 gratuitous aspersions of his character, as if he took no notice of the enmity which lurks under your pretended friendship.” There is thus a cogency in the prophet’s manner of treating his subject. Men are disposed to admit that God is judge, but, at the same time, to fabricate excuses for evading his judgment, and it was therefore necessary that the sentence which God was about to pronounce should be vindicated from the vain cavils which might be brought against it.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.ii-p7"></a><a name="xvi.ii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p8"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Hear, O my people! and I will speak.</i> Hitherto the prophet has spoken as the herald of God, throwing out several expressions designed to alarm the minds of those whom he addressed. But from this to the end of the psalm God himself is introduced as the speaker; and to show the importance 			 of the subject, he uses additional terms to awaken attention, calling them his own people, that he might challenge the higher authority to his words, and intimating, that the following address is not of a mere ordinary description, but an expostulation with them for the infraction of his covenant. Some read, <i>I will testify against thee. </i>But the reference, as we may gather from the common usage of Scripture, seems rather to be to a discussion of 			 mutual claims. God would remind them of his covenant, and solemnly <i>exact </i>from them, as his chosen people, what was due according to the terms of it. He announces himself to be the God of Israel, that he may recall them to allegiance and subjection, and the repetition of his name is emphatical: as if he had said, When you would have me to submit to your inventions, how far is this audacity from that honor and reverence which belong to me? I am 			 God, and therefore my majesty ought to repress presumption, and make all flesh keep silence when I speak; and among you, to whom I have made myself known as your God, I have still stronger claims to homage.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.ii-p9"></a><a name="xvi.ii-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p10"></a><b>8</b> <i>I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices, etc. </i>God now proceeds to state the charge which he adduced against them. He declares, that he attached no value whatsoever to sacrifices in themselves considered. Not that he asserts this rite of the Jews to have been vain and useless, for 			 in that case it never would have been instituted by God; but there is this difference betwixt religious exercises and others, that they can only meet the approbation of God when performed in their true spirit and meaning. On any other supposition they are deservedly rejected. Similar language we will find employed again and again by the prophets, as I have remarked in other places, and particularly in connection with the fortieth psalm. Mere outward ceremonies being therefore possessed of no 			 value, God repudiates the idea that he had ever insisted upon them as the main thing in religion, or designed that they should be viewed in any other light than as helps to spiritual worship. Thus in <a name="xvi.ii-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#022">Jer 7:22</a><a name="xvi.ii-p10.1"></a>, he denies that he had issued any commandment regarding sacrifices; and the prophet Micah says,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.ii-p11"></a>“Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten thousands of rivers of oil? and what doth the Lord require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy?” — (<a name="xvi.ii-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic006.htm#007">Mic 6:7</a><a name="xvi.ii-p11.1"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p12"></a>“I desire mercy,” he says in another place, (<a name="xvi.ii-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006">Ho 6:6</a><a name="xvi.ii-p12.1"></a>,) “and not sacrifice.” The same doctrine is every where declared by the prophets. I might refer especially to the prophecies of Isaiah, chapter <a name="xvi.ii-p12.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#012">Isa. 1:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa058.htm#001">Isa. 58:1</a>, Isa. 266:3<a name="xvi.ii-p12.2"></a>. The sacrifices of the ungodly are not only represented as worthless and rejected by the Lord, but as peculiarly calculated to provoke his anger. Where a right use has been made of the institution, and they have been observed merely as ceremonies for the confirmation and increase of faith, then they are described as being essentially connected with true religion; but when offered without faith, or, what is still worse, under the 			 impression of their meriting the favor of God for such as continue in their sins, they are reprobated as a mere profanation of divine worship. It is evident, then, what God means when he says, <i>I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices; </i>he looked to something beyond these. The last clause of the verse may be understood as asserting that their burnt-offerings were before the eyes 			 of the Lord to the producing even of satiety and disgust, as we find him saying, (<a name="xvi.ii-p12.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#013">Isa 1:13</a><a name="xvi.ii-p12.3"></a>,) that they were “an abomination unto him.” There are some, however, who consider the negative in the beginning of the verse as applying to both clauses, and that God here declares that he did not design to reckon with them for any want of regularity in the observance of their sacrifices. It has 			 been well suggested by some, that the relative may be understood, <i>Thy burnt-offerings which are continually before me; </i>as if he had said, According to the Law these are imperative; but I will bring no accusation against you at this time for omitting your sacrifices.   			  <a name="fr_246"></a><a href="#fn_246"><font size="1">247</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.ii-p14"></a><a name="xvi.ii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p15"></a><b>9</b>  <i>I will take no calf out thy house</i> Two reasons are given in this and the succeeding verses to prove that he cannot set any value upon sacrifices. The first is, that supposing him to depend upon these, he needs not to be indebted for them to man, having all 			 the fullness of the earth at his command; and the second, that he requires neither food nor drink as we do for the support of our infirm natures. Upon the first of these he insists in the ninth and three following verses, where he adverts to his own boundless possessions, that he may show his absolute independence of human offerings. He then points at the wide distinction betwixt himself and man, the latter being dependent for a frail subsistence upon meat and drink, while he is the 			 self-existent One, and communicates life to all beside. There may be nothing new in the truths here laid down by the Psalmist; but, considering the strong propensity we have by nature to form our estimate of God from ourselves, and to degenerate into a carnal worship, they convey a lesson by no means unnecessary, and which contains profound wisdom, that man can never benefit God by any of his services, as we have seen in <a name="xvi.ii-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#002">Ps 16:2</a><a name="xvi.ii-p15.1"></a>, “My goodness extendeth not unto thee.” In the second place, God says that he does not require any thing for his own us but that, as he is sufficient in his own perfection, he has consulted the good of man in all that he has enjoined. We have a passage in Isaiah to a similar effect,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE23"><a name="xvi.ii-p16"></a>“The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me, and where is the place of my rest? For all these things hath mine hand made.” — (<a name="xvi.ii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001">Isa. 66:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#002">2</a><a name="xvi.ii-p16.1"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p17"></a>In these words</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p18"></a>God asserts his absolute independence; for while the world had a beginning, he himself was from eternity. From this it follows, that as he subsisted when there was nothing without him which could contribute to his fullness, he must have in himself a glorious all-sufficiency.</p>  <a name="xvi.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p7"></a>These verses cast light upon the preceding context. Had it been stated in unqualified terms that sacrifices were of no value, we might have been perplexed to know why in that case they were instituted by God; but the difficulty disappears when we perceive that they are spoken of only in comparison with the true worship of God. From this we infer, that when properly observed, they were far from 			 incurring divine condemnation. There is in all men by nature a strong and ineffaceable conviction that they ought to worship God. Indisposed to worship him in a pure and spiritual manner, it becomes necessary that they should invent some specious appearance as a substitute; and however clearly they may be persuaded of the vanity of such conduct, they persist in it to the last, because they shrink from a total renunciation of the service of God. Men have always, accordingly, been found addicted 			 to ceremonies until they have been brought to the knowledge of that which constitutes true and acceptable religion. <i>Praise</i> and <i>prayer </i>are here to be considered as representing the whole of the worship of God, according to the figure synecdoche. The Psalmist specifies only one part of divine worship, when he enjoins us to 			 acknowledge God as the Author of all our mercies, and to ascribe to him the praise which is justly due unto his name: and adds, that we should betake ourselves to his goodness, cast all our cares into his bosom, and seek by prayer that deliverance which he alone can give, and thanks for which must afterwards be rendered to him. Faith, self-denial, a holy life, and patient endurance of the cross, are all sacrifices which please God. But as <i>prayer </i>is the offspring of faith, and uniformly accompanied with patience and mortification of sin, while <i>praise, </i>where it is genuine, indicates holiness of heart, we need not wonder that these two points of worship should here be employed to represent the whole. Praise and prayer are set in opposition to ceremonies and mere external observances of religion, to teach us, that 			 the worship of God is spiritual. Praise is first mentioned, and this might seem an inversion of natural order. But in reality it may be ranked first without any violation of propriety. An ascription to God of the honor due unto his name lies at the foundation of all prayer, and application to him as the fountain of goodness is the most elementary exercise of faith. Testimonies of his goodness await us ere yet we are born into the world, and we may therefore be said to owe the debt of gratitude 			 before we are called to the necessity of supplication. Could we suppose men to come into the world in the full exercise of reason and judgment, their first act of spiritual sacrifice should be that of thanksgiving. There is no necessity, however, for exercising our ingenuity in defense of the order here adopted by the Psalmist, it being quite sufficient to hold that he here, in a general and popular manner, describes the spiritual worship of God as consisting in praise, prayer, and 			 thanksgiving. In the injunction here given, to <i>pay our vows, </i>there is an allusion to what was in use under the ancient dispensation,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xvi.iii-p8"></a>“What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me? I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord.” <a name="xvi.iii-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#012">Ps. 116:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa116.htm#013">13</a><a name="xvi.iii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p9"></a>What the words inculcate upon the Lord’s people is, in short, gratitude, which they were then in the habit of testifying by solemn sacrifices. But we shall now direct our attention more particularly to the important point of the doctrine which is set before us in this passage. And the first thing deserving our notice is, that the Jews, as well as ourselves, were enjoined to yield a spiritual worship to God. Our 			 Lord, when he taught that this was the only acceptable species of worship, rested his proof upon the one argument, that “God is a spirit,” (<a name="xvi.iii-p9.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#024">Joh 4:24</a><a name="xvi.iii-p9.2"></a>.) He was no less a spirit, however, under the period of the legal ceremonies than after they were abolished; and must, therefore, have demanded then the same mode of worship which he now enjoins. It is true that he subjected the Jews to the ceremonial yoke, but in 			 this he had a respect to the age of the Church; as afterwards, in the abrogation of it, he had an eye to our advantage. In every essential respect the worship was the same. The distinction was one entirely of outward form, God accommodating himself to their weaker and unripe apprehensions by the rudiments of ceremony, while he has extended a simple form of worship to us who have attained a maturer age since the coming of Christ. In himself there is no alteration. The idea entertained by the 			 Manicheans, that the change of dispensation necessarily inferred a change in God himself, was as absurd as it would be to arrive at a similar conclusion from the periodical alterations of the seasons. These outward rites are, therefore, in themselves of no importance, and acquire it only in so far as they are useful in confirming our faith, so that we may call upon the name of the Lord with a pure heart. The Psalmist, therefore, justly denounces the hypocrites who gloried in their ostentatious 			 services, and declares that they observed them in vain. It may occur to some, that as sacrifices sustained a necessary place under the Law, they could not be warrantably neglected by the Jewish worshipper; but by attending to the scope of the Psalmist, we may easily discover that he does not propose to abrogate them so far as they were helps to piety, but to correct that erroneous view of them, which was fraught with the deepest injury to religion.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.iii-p10"></a><a name="xvi.iii-p10.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p11"></a>In the fifteenth verse we have first an injunction to prayer, then a promise of its being answered, and afterwards a call to thanksgiving. We are enjoined to pray <i>in the day of trouble, </i>but not with the understanding that we are to pray only then, for prayer is a duty incumbent upon us every day, and every 			 moment of our lives. Be our situation ever so comfortable and exempt from disquietude, we must never cease to engage in the exercise of supplication, remembering that, if God should withdraw his favor for a moment, we would be undone. In affliction, however our faith is more severely tried, and there is a propriety in specifying it as the season of prayer; the prophet pointing us to God as the only resort and means of safety in the day of our urgent necessity. A promise is subjoined to animate 			 us in the duty, disposed as we are to be overwhelmed by a sense of the majesty of God, or of our own unworthiness. Gratitude is next enjoined, in consideration of God’s answer to our prayers. Invocation of the name of God being represented in this passage as constituting a principal part of divine worship, all who make pretensions to piety will feel how necessary it is to preserve the pure and uncorrupted form of it. We are forcibly taught the detestable nature of the error upon this point 			 entertained by the Papists, who transfer to angels and to men an honor which belongs exclusively to God. They may pretend to view these in no other light than as patrons, who pray for them to God. But it is evident that these patrons are impiously substituted by them in the room of Christ, whose mediation they reject. It is apparent, besides, from the form of their prayers, that they recognize no distinction between God and the very least of their saints. They ask the same things from Saint 			 Claudius which they ask from the Almighty, and offer the prayer of our Lord to the image of Catherine. I am aware that the Papists justify their invocation of the dead, by denying that their prayers to them amount to divine worship. They talk so much about the kind of worship which they call <i>latria, </i>that is, the worship which they give to God alone, as to make it appear, that in the invocation of angels and saints they give none of it to 			 them.   			  <a name="fr_249"></a><a href="#fn_249"><font size="1">250</font></a>
  			  But it is impossible to read the words of the Psalmist, now under our consideration, without perceiving that all true religion is gone unless God alone is called upon. Were the Papists asked whether it were lawful to offer sacrifices to the dead, they would immediately reply in the negative. They grant to this day that sacrifice could not lawfully be offered to Peter or to Paul, for the common sense of mankind would dictate the profanity of such an act. And when we 			 here see God preferring the invocation of his name to all sacrifices, is it not plain to demonstration, that those who call upon the dead are chargeable with the grossest impiety? From this it follows, that the Papists, let them abound as they may in their genuflections before God, rob him of the chief part of his glory when they direct their supplications to the saints.   			  <a name="fr_250"></a><a href="#fn_250"><font size="1">251</font></a>
  			  The express mention which is made in these verses of affliction is fitted to comfort the weak and the fearful believer. When God has withdrawn the outward marks of his favor, a doubt is apt to steal into our minds whether he really cares for our salvation. So far is this from being well founded, that adversity is sent to us by God, just to stir us up to seek him and to call upon his name. Nor should we overlook the fact, that our prayers are only acceptable when we 			 offer them in compliance with the commandment of God, and are animated to them by a consideration of the promise which he has extended. The argument which the Papists have drawn from the passage, in support of their multiplied vows, is idle and unwarrantable. The Psalmist, as we have already hinted, when he enjoins the payment of their vows, refers only to solemn thanksgiving, whereas they trust in their vows as meriting salvation. They contract vows, beside, which have no divine warrant, but, 			 on the contrary, are explicitly condemned by the word of God.</p>  <a name="xvi.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="xvi.iv-p5"></a><b>16</b> <i>But unto the wicked, etc. </i>He now proceeds to direct his censures more openly against those whose whole religion lies in an observance of ceremonies, with which they attempt to blind the eyes of God. An exposure is made of the vanity of seeking to shelter impurity of heart and life 			 under a veil of outward services, a lesson which ought to have been received by all with true consent, but which was peculiarly ungrateful to Jewish ears. It has been universally confessed, that the worship of God is pure and acceptable only when it proceeds from a sincere heart. The acknowledgement has been extorted from the poets of the heathen, and it is known that the profligate were wont to be excluded from their temples and from participation in their sacrifices. And yet such is the 			 influence of hypocrisy in choking and obliterating even a sentiment so universally felt as this, that men of the most abandoned character will obtrude themselves into the presence of God, in the confidence of deceiving him with their vain inventions. This may explain the frequency of the warnings which we find in the prophets upon this subject, declaring to the ungodly again and again, that they only aggravate their guilt by assuming the semblance of piety. Loudly as the Spirit of God has 			 asserted, that a form of godliness, unaccompanied by the grace of faith and repentance, is but a sacrilegious abuse of the name of God; it is yet impossible to drive the Papists out of the devilish delusion, that their idlest services are sanctified by what they call their <i>final intention. </i>They grant that none but such as are in a state of grace can possess the <i>meritum de condigno;</i>   			  <a name="fr_251"></a><a href="#fn_251"><font size="1">252</font></a>
  			  but they maintain that the mere outward acts of devotion, without any accompanying sentiments of the heart, may prepare a person at least for the reception of grace. And thus, if a monk rise from the bed of his adultery to chant a few psalms without one spark of godliness in his breast, or if a whore-monger, a thief, or any foresworn villain, seeks to make reparation for his crimes by mass or pilgrimage, they would be loath to consider this 			 lost labor. By God, on the other hand, such a disjunction of the form from the inward sentiment of devotion is branded as sacrilege. In the passage before us, the Psalmist sets aside and refutes a very common objection which might be urged. Must not, it might be said, those sacrifices be in some respect acceptable to God which are offered up in his honor? He shows that, on the contrary, they entail guilt upon the parties who present them, inasmuch as they lie to God, and profane his holy name. 			 He checks their presumption with the words, <i>What hast thou to do to declare my statutes?</i> that is, to pretend that you are one of my people, and that you have a part in my covenant. Now, if God in this manner rejects the whole of that profession of godliness, which is unaccompanied by purity of heart, how shall we expect him to treat the observance of mere ceremonies, which hold 			 quite an inferior place to the declaration of the statutes of God?</p>

 <p><a name="xvi.iv-p8"></a><b>17. </b><i>Also thou hatest correction</i> Here hypocrites are challenged with treacherous duplicity in denying, by their life and their works, that godliness which they have professed with the lip. Their contempt of God he proves from their want of reverential deference to his Word; subjection to the Word of God, and 			 cordial submission to his precepts and instructions, being the surest test of religious principle. One way in which hypocrisy usually displays itself is, by the ingenious excuses it invents for evading the duty of obedience. The Psalmist points to this as the mainspring of their ungodliness, that they had cast the Word of God behind their back, while he insinuates that the principle from which all true worship flows is the obedience of faith. He adverts also to the cause of their perversity, 			 which lies in the unwillingness of their corrupt heart to suffer the yoke of God. They have no hesitation in granting that whatever proceeds from the mouth of God is both true and right; this honor they are willing to concede to his Word; but in so far as it proposes to regulate their conduct, and restrain their sinful affections, they dislike and detest it. Our corruption, indisposing us to receive correction, exasperates us against the Word of God; nor is it possible that we can ever listen 			 to it with true docility and meekness of mind, till we have been brought to give ourselves up to be ruled and disciplined by its precepts. The Psalmist next proceeds to specify some of those works of ungodliness, informing us that hypocrites, who were addicted to theft and adultery, mixed up and polluted the holy name of God with their wickedness. By adverting only to some species of vices, he would intimate, in general, that those who have despised correction, and hardened themselves against 			 instruction, are prepared to launch into every excess which corrupt desire or evil example may suggests. He makes mention, first, of thefts; then of adulteries; and, thirdly, of calumnies or false reproaches. Most interpreters render <a name="xvi.iv-p8.1"></a>תרף, <i>tirets, to run, </i>although others derive it from <a name="xvi.iv-p8.2"></a>רצה,<i> ratsah, </i>rendering it <i>to consent. </i>Either translation agrees sufficiently with the scope of the Psalmist, and the preference may be left to the reader’s own choice. The charge here brought against hypocrites, that they <i>put forth their mouth to evil, </i>may include not merely slander, but all the different kinds of speaking which injure their neighbors, for it immediately follows, <i>my tongue frameth deceit</i> It is well known in what a variety of ways the lying and deceitful tongue may inflict injury and pain. When it is added, Thou <i>sittest, etc., </i>the allusion may be to one who sits for the passing of a formal judgment; as if it had been said, Thou defamest thy brethren under pretext of issuing a just sentence.   			  <a name="fr_252"></a><a href="#fn_252"><font size="1">253</font></a>

  			  It seems more probable, however, that he refers to the higher crime of accusing the innocent and righteous in open court, and bringing false charges against them. <i>Brethren, </i>and <i>the children of their mother,</i>   			  <a name="fr_254"></a><a href="#fn_254"><font size="1">255</font></a>

 <p><a name="xvi.v-p8"></a><b>21</b> <i>These things hast thou done</i> Hypocrites, until they feel the hand of God against them, are ever ready to surrender themselves to a state of security, and nothing is more difficult than to awaken their apprehensions. By this alarming language the Psalmist aims at convincing them of the 			 certainty of destruction should they longer presume upon the forbearance of God, and thus provoke his anger the more, by imagining that he can favor the practice of sin. The greatest dishonor which any can cast upon his name is that of impeaching his justice. This hypocrites may not venture to do in an open manner, but in their secret and corrupt imagination they figure God to be different from what he is, that they may take occasion from his conceived forbearance to indulge a false peace of 			 mind, and escape the disquietude which they could not fail to feel were they seriously persuaded that God was the avenger of sin. We have a sufficient proof in the supine security which hypocrites display, that they must have formed such false conceptions of God. They not only exclude from their thoughts his judicial character, but think of him as the patron and approver of their sins. The Psalmist reprehends them for abusing the goodness and clemency of God, in the way of cherishing a vain 			 hope that they may transgress with impunity. He warns them, that ere long they will be dragged into the light, and that those sins which they would have hidden from the eyes of God would be set in all their enormity before their view. He will set the whole list of their sins in distinct order, for so I understand the expression, <i>to set in order, </i>before their view, and force them 			 upon their observation.</p>

 <p><a name="xvi.v-p10"></a><b>22</b> <i>Now consider this, ye that forget God</i> Here we have more of that severe expostulation which is absolutely necessary in dealing with hardened hypocrites, who otherwise will only deride all instruction. While, however, the Psalmist threatens and intends to alarm them, he would, at the 			 same time, hold out to them the hope of pardon, upon their hastening to avail themselves of it. But to prevent them from giving way to delay, he warns them of the severity, as well as the suddenness, of the divine judgments. He also charges them with base ingratitude, in having forgotten God. And here what a remarkable proof have we of the grace of God in extending the hope of mercy to those corrupt men, who had so impiously profaned his worship, who had so audaciously and sacrilegiously mocked 			 at his forbearance, and who had abandoned themselves to such scandalous crimes! In calling them to repentance, without all doubt he extends to them the hope of God being reconciled to them, that they may venture to appear in the presence of his majesty. And can we conceive of greater clemency than this, thus to invite to himself, and into the bosom of the Church, such perfidious apostates and violators of his covenant, who had departed from the doctrine of godliness in which they had been 			 brought up? Great as it is, we would do well to reflect that it is no greater than what we have ourselves experienced. We, too, had apostatized from the Lord, and in his singular mercy has he brought us again into his fold. It should not escape our notice, that the Psalmist urges them to hasten their return, as the door of mercy will not always stand open for their admission — a needful lesson to us all! lest we allow the day of our merciful visitation to pass by, and be left, like Esau, to 			 indulge in unavailing lamentations, (<a name="xvi.v-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen027.htm#034">Ge 27:34</a><a name="xvi.v-p10.1"></a>.) So much is implied when it is said, <i>God shall seize upon you, and there shall be none to deliver</i>    			  <a name="fr_256"></a><a href="#fn_256"><font size="1">257</font></a>

 <p><a name="xvi.v-p13"></a><b>23</b> <i>Whoso offereth praise will glorify me</i> This is the third time that the Psalmist has inculcated the truth, that the most acceptable sacrifice in God’s sight is praise, by which we express to him the gratitude of our hearts for his blessings. The repetition is not a needless one, and 			 that on two accounts. In the first place, there is nothing with which we are more frequently chargeable than forgetfulness of the benefits of the Lord. Scarcely one out of a thousand attracts our notice; and if it does, it is only slightly, and, as it were, in passing. And, secondly, we do not assign that importance to the duty of praise which it deserves. We are apt to neglect it as something trivial, and altogether commonplace; whereas it constitutes the chief exercise of godliness, in which 			 God would have us to be engaged during the whole of our life. In the words before us, the sacrifice of praise is asserted to form the true and proper worship of God. The words, <i>will glorify me, </i>imply that God is then truly and properly worshipped, and the glory which he requires yielded to him, when his goodness is celebrated with a sincere and grateful heart; but that all the 			 other sacrifices to which hypocrites attach such importance are worthless in his estimation, and no part whatsoever of his worship. Under the word <i>praise, </i>however, is comprehended, as I have already noticed, both faith and prayer. There must be an experience of the goodness of the Lord before our mouths can be opened to praise him for it, and this goodness can only be experienced 			 by faith. Hence it follows, that the whole of spiritual worship is comprehended under what is either presupposed in the exercise of praise, or flows from it. Accordingly, in the words which immediately follow, the Psalmist calls upon those who desired that their services should be approved of God, <i>to order their way aright</i> By the expression here used of <i>ordering one’s way, </i>some understand repentance or confession of sin to be meant; others, the taking out of the way such things as may prove grounds of offense, or obstacles in the way of others. It seems more probable that the Psalmist enjoins them to walk in the right way as opposed to that in which hypocrites are found, and intimates that God is only to be approached by those who seek him with a sincere heart and in an upright manner. By <i>the salvation of God, </i>I do not, with some, understand a great or signal salvation. God speaks of himself in the third person, the more clearly to satisfy them of the fact, that he would eventually prove to all his genuine worshippers how truly he sustained the character of their Savior.</p>

Dr Adam Clarke explains it in the first of these senses; observing, that “to any minor consideration or fact it seems impossible with any propriety to restrain it.” It appears, however, as Calvin holds, to be rather the aim and intention of the poem to teach 				  the utter uselessness of all outward ceremonies in the absence of inward piety; and it is constructed on the plan of a dramatic performance, the sole actor being Jehovah seated on his throne in Zion, and the audience being the whole world, who are summoned to be witnesses of the judgment which he is to execute upon his people. This is the view taken by Bishop Lowth in his Lectures on Sacred Poetry, volume 2, p. 235. Walford gives the same interpretation. “To interpret this passage,” says he, 				  “of the promulgation of the Gospel, as is done by Bishop Horne and other expositors of this book, is for the sake of a favorite theory to confound things that are distinct, and to throw obscurity over the whole, by which its specific design is darkened, and the poem deprived of its consistency and unity. The great purpose of the psalm is to deliver the judgment of God respecting the Jewish people; and heaven and earth are summoned, as in 				  <a name="xvi.i-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa001.htm#002">Isa 1:2</a><a name="xvi.i-p14.1"></a>, to behold the righteousness of Jehovah, and bear their testimony to it.”</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi.i-p24"></a> The manner in which covenants were anciently ratified by sacrifices was this: The victim was cut into two parts, and each half was placed upon an altar. The contracting parties then passed between the pieces, which was a kind of imprecation upon the party who should violate the covenant, being as much as to say, May he or they be cut asunder like that dissected victim. In this 				  manner, the covenant which God made with Abraham and his family was ratified, <a name="xvi.i-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#009">Gen. 15:9</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#017">17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#018">18</a><a name="xvi.i-p24.2"></a>.

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi.iii-p12"></a> The Papists have different words by which they express different degrees of worship. The term <a name="xvi.iii-p12.2"></a>λατρεια, or <a name="xvi.iii-p12.3"></a><i>latria</i>, they 				  say, denotes the divine worship which exclusively belongs to God, and which they yield to him alone; while <a name="xvi.iii-p12.4"></a>δουλεια, or <a name="xvi.iii-p12.5"></a><i>dulia</i>, signifies that inferior sort of worship which is due to angels and departed saints, and which alone they yield to 				  them. They have also a third degree, which they call <a name="xvi.iii-p12.6"></a>ὑπερδουλεια, or <a name="xvi.iii-p12.7"></a><i>hyperdulia</i>, that superior kind of inferior worship which they yield to the Virgin Mary. These distinctions are had recourse to, merely to evade the charge of idolatry. But if 				  the Papists yield to angels and glorified saints the honor due only to God, it is of little consequence by what name it is called. Besides, the words <a name="xvi.iii-p12.8"></a>λατρεαι and <a name="xvi.iii-p12.9"></a>δουλεαι are used indifferently by classic Greek authors, by the Greek fathers, by the Septuagint, and in the New 				  Testament, to express divine worship.

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xvi.v-p11"></a> The language here is metaphorical. The Almighty, provoked by the wickedness of these hypocrites, compares himself to a lion, who, with irresistible fury, seizes on his prey, and tears it in pieces, none being able to rescue it from his jaws. We meet with a similar form of expression in <a name="xvi.v-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#014">Ho 5:14</a><a name="xvi.v-p11.1"></a>: “For I will be as a lion unto Ephraim, and as a young lion to the house 				  of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will take away, and none shall rescue him.” We must not, however, suppose that the rage and fury of this relentless destroyer can have place in the bosom of the Deity. Such phraseology is adopted in accommodation to the feebleness of our conceptions, and our contracted modes of thinking, to impress the hearts and consciences of sinners with a conviction of the tremendous character of the judgments of God, and the fearful condition of those who fall 				  under his penal wrath.</p>
