 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN13"><a name="viii-p1"></a>PSALM 42</p>  		
 <p><a name="viii-p2"></a>In the first place, David shows that when he was forced to flee by reason of the cruelty of Saul, and was living in a state of exile, what most of all grieved him was, that he was deprived of the opportunity of access to the sanctuary; for he preferred the service of God to every earthly advantage. In the second place, he shows that being tempted with despair, he had in this respect a very difficult contest to sustain. In order to strengthen his 		  hope, he also introduces prayer and meditation on the grace of God. Last of all, he again makes mention of the inward conflict which he had with the sorrow which he experienced.</p>  		
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent15"><a name="viii-p3"></a>To the chief musician. A lesson of instruction to the sons of Korah.</p>  		
 <p><a name="viii-p4"></a>The name of David is not expressly mentioned in the inscription of this psalm. Many conjecture that the sons of Korah were the authors of it. This, I think, is not at all probable. As it is composed in the person of David, who, it is well known, was endued above all others with the spirit of prophecy, who will believe that it was written and composed for him by another person? He was the teacher generally of the whole Church, and 		  a distinguished instrument of the Spirit. He had already delivered to the company of the Levites, of whom the sons of Korah formed a part, other psalms to be sung by them. What need, then, had he to borrow their help, or to have recourse to their assistance in a matter which he was much better able of himself to execute than they were? To me, therefore, it seems more probable, that the sons of Korah are here mentioned because this psalm was committed as a precious treasure to be preserved by 		  them, as we know that out of the number of the singers, some were chosen and appointed to be keepers of the psalms. That there is no mention made of David’s name does not of itself involve any difficulty, since we see the same omission in other psalms, of which there is, notwithstanding, the strongest grounds for concluding that he was the author. As to the word <a name="viii-p4.1"></a>משכיל, <i>maskil, </i>I have already made some remarks upon it in the thirty-second psalm. This word, it is true, is sometimes found in the inscription of other psalms besides those in which David declares that he had been subjected to the chastening rod of God. It is, however, to be observed, that it is properly applied to chastisements, since the design of them is to instruct the children of God, when they do not sufficiently profit from doctrine. As to the particular 		  time of the composition of this psalm, expositors are not altogether agreed. Some suppose that David here complains of his calamity, when he was expelled from the throne by his son Absalom. But I am rather disposed to entertain a different opinion, founded, if I mistake not, upon good reasons. The rebellion of Absalom was very soon suppressed, so that it did not long prevent David from approaching the sanctuary. And yet, the lamentation which he here makes refers expressly to a long state of 		  exile, under which he had languished, and, as it were, pined away with grief. It is not the sorrow merely of a few days which he describes in the third verse; nay, the scope of the entire composition will clearly show that he had languished for a long time in the wretched condition of which he speaks. It has been alleged as an argument against referring this psalm to the reign of Saul, that the ark of the covenant was neglected during his reign, so that it is not very likely that David at that 		  time conducted the stated choral services in the sanctuary; but this argument is not very conclusive: for although Saul only worshipped God as a mere matter of form, yet he was unwilling to be regarded in any other light than as a devout man. And as to David, he has shown in other parts of his writings with what diligence he frequented the holy assemblies, and more especially on festival days. Certainly, these words which we shall meet with in <a name="viii-p4.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa055.htm#014">Ps 55:14</a><a name="viii-p4.2"></a>, “We walked unto the house of God in company,” relate to the time of Saul.</p>  <a name="viii.i"></a>

 <p><a name="viii.i-p6"></a><b>1.</b> <i>As the hart crieth for the fountains of water, etc</i>  The meaning of these two verses simply is, that David preferred to all the enjoyments, riches, pleasures, and honors of this world, the 			 opportunity of access to the sanctuary, that in this way he might cherish and strengthen his faith and piety by the exercises prescribed in the Law. When he says that he <i>cried for the living God, </i>we are not to understand it merely in the sense of a burning love and desire towards God: but we ought to remember in what manner it is that, God allures us to himself, and by what means 			 he raises our minds upwards. He does not enjoin us to ascend forthwith into heaven, but, consulting our weakness, he descends to us. David, then, considering that the way of access was shut against him, cried to God, because he was excluded from the outward service of the sanctuary, which is the sacred bond of intercourse with God. I do not mean to say that the observance of external ceremonies can of itself bring us into favor with God, but they are religious exercises which we cannot bear to 			 want by reason of our infirmity. David, therefore, being excluded from the sanctuary, is no less grieved than if he had been separated from God himself. He did not, it is true, cease in the meantime to direct his prayers towards heaven, and even to the sanctuary itself; but conscious of his own infirmity, he was specially grieved that the way by which the faithful obtained access to God was shut against him. This is an example which may well suffice to put to shame the arrogance of those who 			 without concern can bear to be deprived of those means,   			  <a name="fr_112"></a><a href="#fn_112"><font size="1">113</font></a>
  			  or rather, who proudly despise them, as if it were in their power to ascend to heaven in a moment’s flight; nay, as if they surpassed David in zeal and alacrity of mind. We must not, however, imagine that the prophet suffered himself to rest in earthly elements,   			  <a name="fr_113"></a><a href="#fn_113"><font size="1">114</font></a>
  			  but only that he made use of them as a ladder, by which he might ascend to God, finding that he had not wings with which to fly thither. The similitude which he takes from<i> a hart</i> is designed to express the extreme ardor of his desire. The sense in which some explain this is, that the waters are eagerly sought by the harts, that they may recover from 			 fatigue; but this, perhaps, is too limited. I admit that if the hunter pursue the stag, and the dogs also follow hard after it, when it comes to a river it gathers new strength by plunging into it. But we know also that at certain seasons of the year, harts, with an almost incredible desire, and more intensely than could proceed from mere thirst, seek after water; and although I would not contend for it, yet I think this is referred to by the prophet here.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.i-p9"></a><a name="viii.i-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.i-p10"></a>The second verse illustrates more clearly what I have already said, that David does not simply speak of the presence of God, but of the presence of God in connection with certain symbols; for he sets before himself the tabernacle, the altar, the sacrifices, and other ceremonies by which God had testified that he would be near his people; and that it behoved the faithful, in seeking to approach God, to begin by those things. 			 Not that they should continue attached to them, but that they should, by the help of these signs and outward means, seek to behold the glory of God, which of itself is hidden from the sight. Accordingly, when we see the marks of the divine presence engraven on the word, or on external symbols, we can say with David that there <i>is the face of God, </i>provided we come with pure hearts 			 to seek him in a spiritual manner. But when we imagine God to be present otherwise than he has revealed himself in his word, and the sacred institutions of his worship, or when we form any gross or earthly conception of his heavenly majesty, we are only inventing for ourselves visionary representations, which disfigure the glory of God, and turn his truth into a lie.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.i-p11"></a><a name="viii.i-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.i-p12"></a><b>3.</b> <i>My tears have been my bread</i> Here the Psalmist mentions another sharp piercing shaft with which the wicked and malevolent grievously wounded his heart. There can be no doubt that Satan made use of such means as these to fan the flame that consumed him with grief. “What,” we may 			 suppose that adversary to say, “wouldst thou have? Seest thou not that God hath cast thee off? For certainly he desires to be worshipped in the tabernacle, to which you have now no opportunity of access, and from which you are as it were banished.” These were violent assaults, and enough to have overturned the faith of this holy man, unless, supported by the power of the Spirit in a more than ordinary degree, he had made a strong and vigorous resistance. It is evident that his feelings had been 			 really and strongly affected. We may be often agitated, and yet not to such an extent as to abstain from eating and drinking; but when a man voluntarily abstains from food, and indulges so much in weeping, that he daily neglects his ordinary meals, and is continually overwhelmed in sorrow, it is obvious that he is troubled in no light degree; but that he is wounded severely, and even to the heart.   			  <a name="fr_114"></a><a href="#fn_114"><font size="1">115</font></a>
  			  Now, David says, that he did not experience greater relief in any thing whatever than from weeping; and, therefore, he gave himself up to it, just in the same manner as men take pleasure and enjoyment in eating; and this he says had been the case every day, and not only for a short time. Let us, therefore, whenever the ungodly triumph over us in our miseries, and spitefully taunt us that God is against us, never forget that it is Satan who moves them to speak in 			 this manner, in order to overthrow our faith; and that, therefore, it is not time for us to take our ease, or to yield to indifference, when a war so dangerous is waged against us. There is still another reason which ought to inspire us with such feelings, and it is this, that the name of God is held up to scorn by the ungodly; for they cannot scoff at our faith without greatly reproaching him. If, then, we are not altogether insensible, we must in such circumstances be affected with the 			 deepest sorrow.</p>  <a name="viii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="viii.ii-p7"></a><b>4.</b> <i>When I remember these things</i> This verse is somewhat obscure, on account of the variation of the tenses in the Hebrew. And yet I have no doubt that the true and natural sense is, that David, when he called to remembrance his former condition, experienced so much the greater sadness 			 by comparing it with his present condition. The remembrance, I say, of the past had no small influence in aggravating his misery, from the thought that he, who had formerly acted the part of a leader and standard-bearer in conducting others to the holy assemblies, should now be debarred from access to the temple. We know that those who have been accustomed to suffering from their childhood become insensible to it, and the very continuance of misery produces in us a certain degree of 			 callousness, so that we cease to think of it, or to regard it as anything unusual. It is different with those who have not been so accustomed to it. And, therefore, it is no wonder if David, who had been not one of the common people, but who had lately occupied a chief place among the princes, and had been leader of the foremost ranks among the faithful, should be more grievously disquieted, when he saw himself utterly cast off, and not admitted to a place even among the lowest. Accordingly, I 			 connect the demonstrative pronoun <i>these</i> with the declaration which follows, namely, that he remembered how he had been accustomed to mingle in the company of the godly, and to lead them to the house of God. <i>To pour out</i> <i>the 			 soul</i> is taken metaphorically by some for to give utterance to his grief<i>; </i>others are of opinion, that it signifies to rejoice greatly<i>, </i>or, as we commonly speak, to be melted or dissolved in joy It appears to me that David rather means to say, that his affections were, as it were, melted 			 within him, whether it were from joy or sorrow. As the soul of man sustains him, so long as it keeps its energies collected, so also it sinks within him, and, as it were, vanishes away, when any of the affections, by excessive indulgence, gains the ascendancy.   			  <a name="fr_117"></a><a href="#fn_117"><font size="1">118</font></a>
  			  Accordingly, he is said to pour out his soul, who is so excited, that his affections lose their vigor, and begin to flow out. David’s language implies, that his soul melted and fainted within him by the greatness of his sorrow, when he thought of the condition from which he had fallen. If any would rather understand it of <i>joy, </i>the language will admit 			 of such an illustration as this: Formerly I took such a delight in walking foremost in the ranks of the people, and leading them in procession to the sanctuary, that my heart melted within me for joy, and I was quite transported with it: if, therefore, I should again be restored to the same happy condition, all my feelings would be ravished with the same delight. I have, however, already stated what appeared to me to be the best exposition. We must not suppose that David had been overwhelmed 			 with the sorrow of the world; but, as in his present misery he discerned the wrath of God, he sorrowed after a godly sort, because, by his own fault, he had provoked the displeasure of God against him. And, even without touching this reason of his sorrow, we see the source from which it proceeded. Even when afflicted by so many personal privations, he is nevertheless grieved only for the sanctuary, thereby showing that it would have been less distressing to him to have been deprived of life, 			 than to continue in a state of exile from the presence of God. And, indeed, the way in which we ought to regulate all our affections is this, That, on the one hand, our joy may have respect to the paternal love and favor of God towards us, and that, on the other, the only cause of our grief may arise from feeling that he is angry with us. This is the “godly sorrow” of which Paul speaks, <a name="viii.ii-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010">2Co 7:10</a><a name="viii.ii-p8.2"></a>. By the term <i>number, </i>which in the Hebrew is called <a name="viii.ii-p8.3"></a>סך, <i>sach, </i>David, I have no doubt, intended <i>ranks, </i>or <i>companies in 			 procession; </i>for when they went to the tabernacle on the holy days, they went not in confusion or in crowds, but walked in regular order, (<a name="viii.ii-p8.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#044">Lu 2:44</a><a name="viii.ii-p8.4"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii-p9"></a><a name="viii.ii-p9.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p10"></a><b>5</b> <i>O my soul! why art thou cast down?</i> From this it appears that David contended strongly against his sorrow, lest he should yield to temptation: but what we ought chiefly to observe is, that he had experienced a strong and bitter contest before he obtained the victory over it; or we 			 might rather say, that he was not delivered from it after one alarming assault, but was often called upon to enter into new scenes of conflict. It need not excite our wonder that he was so much disquieted and cast down, since he could not discern any sign of the divine favor towards him. But David here represents himself as if he formed two opposing parties. In so far as in the exercise of faith he relied upon the promises of God, being armed with the Spirit of invincible fortitude, he set 			 himself, in opposition to the affections of his flesh, to restrain and subdue them; and, at the same time, he rebuked his own cowardice and imbecility of heart. Moreover, although he carried on war against the devil and the world, yet he does not enter into open and direct conflict with them, but rather regards himself as the enemy against whom he desires chiefly to contend. And doubtless the best way to overcome Satan is, not to go out of ourselves, but to maintain an internal conflict against 			 he desires of our own hearts. It ought, however, to be observed, that David confesses that his soul was cast down within him: for when our infirmities rise up in vast array, and, like the waves of the sea, are ready to overwhelm us, our faith seems to us to fail, and, in consequence we are so overcome by mere fear, that we lack courage, and are afraid to enter into the conflict. Whenever, therefore, such a state of indifference and faint-heartedness shall seize upon us, let us remember, that to 			 govern and subdue the desires of their hearts, and especially to contend against the feelings of distrust which are natural to all, is a conflict to which the godly are not unfrequently called. But here there are two evils specified, which, however apparently different, yet assail our hearts at the same time; the one is <i>discouragement, </i>and the other <i>disquietude</i> When we are quite downcast, we are not free of a feeling of disquietude, which leads us to murmur and complain. The remedy to both of them is here added, <i>hope in God, </i>which alone inspires our minds, in the first place, with confidence in the midst of the greatest troubles; and, secondly, by the exercise of patience, preserves them in peace. In what follows, David very well expresses the power and nature of 			 hope by these words, <i>I shall yet praise him; </i>for it has the effect of elevating our thoughts to the contemplation of the grace of God, when it is hidden from our view. By the term <i>yet, </i>he confesses that for the present, and in so far as the praises of God are 			 concerned, his mouth is stopped, seeing he is oppressed and shut up on all sides. This, however, does not prevent him from extending his hope to some future distant period; and, in order to escape from his present sorrow, and, as it were, get beyond its reach, he promises himself what as yet there was no appearance of obtaining. Nor is this an imaginary expectation produced by a fanciful mind; but, relying upon the promises of God, he not only encourages himself to cherish good hope, but also 			 promises himself certain deliverance. We can only be competent witnesses to our brethren of the grace of God when, in the first place, we have borne testimony to it to our own hearts. What follows, <i>The helps of his countenance, </i>may be differently expounded. Commentators, for the most art, supply the word <i>for: </i>so that, according to this view, David here expresses the matter or cause of thanksgiving — that <i>yet he would give praise or thanks to God for the help of his countenance</i> This interpretation I readily admit. At the same time, the sense will not be inappropriate if we read the terms separately, thus: 			 <i>helps or salvations are from the countenance of God; </i>for as soon as he is pleased to look upon his people he sets them in safety. <i>The countenance of God </i>is taken for the manifestation of his favor. His countenance then appears serene and gracious to us; as, on the contrary, adversity, like the intervening clouds, darkens or obscures its benign aspect.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="viii.ii-p11"></a><a name="viii.ii-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p12"></a><b>6.</b> <i>O my God! my soul is cast down within me.</i> If we suppose that this verse requires no supplement, then it will consist of two distinct and separate sentences. Literally it may be read thus: <i>O my God! my soul is cast down within 			 me, therefore will I remember thee, etc.</i> But the greater number of expositors render the word <a name="viii.ii-p12.1"></a>על-כן<i>, al-ken, </i>by <i>forasmuch as, </i>or <i>because, </i>so that it is employed to express the reason of what is contained 			 in the preceding clause. And certainly it would be very appropriate in this sense, That as often as David, from the land of Jordan, in which he now lay hid as an exile, set himself to think of the sanctuary, his sorrow was so much the more increased. If, however, any would rather, as I have already observed, distinguish this verse into two parts, it must be understood as meaning that David thought of God in his exile, not to nourish his grief, but to assuage it. He did not act the part of those 			 who find no relief in their afflictions but in forgetting God; for although wounded by his hand, he, nevertheless, failed not to acknowledge him to be his physician. Accordingly, the import of the whole verse will be this, I am now living in a state of exile, banished from the temple, and seem to be an alien from the household of God; but this will not prevent me from regarding him, and having recourse to him. I am now deprived of the accustomed sacrifices, of which I stand much in need, but he 			 has not taken from me his word. As, however, the first interpretation is the one more generally received, and this also seems to be added by way of exposition, it is better not to depart from it. David then complains that his soul was oppressed with sorrow, because he saw himself cast out of the Church of God. At the same time, there is in these words a tacit contrast;   			  <a name="fr_118"></a><a href="#fn_118"><font size="1">119</font></a>
  			  as if he had said, It is not the desire to be restored to my wife, or my house, or any of my possessions, which grieves me so much as the distressing consideration, that I now find myself prevented from taking part in the service of God. We ought to learn from this, that although we are deprived of the helps which God has appointed for the edification of our faith and piety, it is, nevertheless, our duty to be diligent in stirring up our minds, that we may never 			 suffer ourselves to be forgetful of God. But, above all, this is to be observed, that as in the preceding verse we have seen David contending courageously against his own affections, so now we here see by what means he steadfastly maintained his ground. He did this by having recourse to the help of God, and taking refuge in it as in a holy sanctuary. And, assuredly, if meditation upon the promises of God do not lead us to prayer, it will not have sufficient power to sustain and confirm us. 			 Unless God impart strength to us, how shall we be able to subdue the many evil thoughts which constantly arise in our minds? The soul of man serves the purpose, as it were, of a workshop to Satan in which to forge a thousand methods of despair. And, therefore, it is not without reason that David, after a severe conflict with himself, has recourse to prayer, and calls upon God as the witness of his sorrow. <i>By the land of 			 Jordan</i> is to be understood that part of the country which, in respect of Judea, was beyond the river of that name. This appears still more clearly from the word Hermonim or Hermons. Hermon was a mountainous district, which extended to a considerable distance; and because it had several tops, was called in the plural number Hermonim.   			  <a name="fr_119"></a><a href="#fn_119"><font size="1">120</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="viii.ii-p15"></a>Perhaps David also has purposely made use of the plural number on account of the fear by which he was forced frequently to change his place of abode, and wander hither and thither. As to the word <i>Mizar, </i>some suppose that it was not the proper name of a mountain, and therefore translate it <i>little, </i>supposing that there is here an indirect comparison of the Hermons with the mountain of Sion, as if David meant to say that Sion, which was comparatively a small hill, was greater in his estimation than the lofty Hermons; but it appears to me that this would be a constrained interpretation.</p>  <a name="viii.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="viii.iii-p7"></a><b>7.</b> <i>Depth calleth unto depth</i> These words express the grievousness, as well as the number and long continuance, of the miseries which he suffered; as if he had said, I am oppressed not only with one kind of misery, but various kinds of distress return one after another, so that there 			 seems to be neither end nor measure to them. In the first place, by the term <i>depth, </i>he shows that the temptations by which he was assailed were such, that they might well be compared to gulfs in the sea; then he complains of their long continuance, which he describes by the very appropriate figure, that his temptations cry out from a distance, and call to one another. In the 			 second part of the verse, he continues the same metaphor, when he says, that <i>all the waves and floods of God have passed over his head</i> By this he means that he had been overwhelmed, and as it were swallowed up by the accumulation of afflictions. It ought, however, to be observed, that he designates the cruelty of Saul, and his other enemies<i>, 			 floods of God, </i>that in all our adversities we may always remember to humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God which afflicts us. But it is of importance to go beyond this, and to consider, that if it should please God to rain with violence upon us, as soon as he shall have opened his sluices or <i>waterspouts, </i>there will be no termination to our miseries till he is appeased; for he has in his power means marvellous and unknown for executing his vengeance against us. Thus, when once his anger is kindled against us, there will be not only one depth to swallow us up, but depth will call unto depth. And as the insensibility of men is such, that they do not stand in awe of the threatenings of God, to the degree in which 			 they ought, whenever mention is made of his vengeance, let us recall this verse to our recollection.</p>

 <p><a name="viii.iii-p9"></a><b>8.</b> <i>Jehovah will command his loving-kindness by day</i> The verb here used is of the future tense; but I do not deny that, according to the Hebrew idiom, it might be rendered in the past tense, as some do who think that David here enumerates the benefits which he had formerly received 			 from God, in order by contrast to add greater force to the complaint which he makes of his present sad and miserable condition; as if he had said, How comes it to pass that God, who formerly manifested so much kindness towards me, having as it were changed his mind, now deals towards me with great severity? But as there is no sufficient reason for changing the tense of the verb, and as the other interpretation seems more in accordance with the scope of the text, let us adhere to it. I do not, 			 indeed, positively deny, that for the strengthening of his faith, David calls to memory the benefits which he had already experienced from God; but I think that he here promises himself deliverance in future, though it be as yet hidden from him. I have, therefore, no desire to raise any discussion regarding the verb, whether it should be taken in the future or in the past tense, provided only it be fully admitted that the argument of David is to this effect: Why should I not expect that God 			 will be merciful to me, so that in the day-time his loving-kindness may be manifested towards me, and by night upon my bed a song of joy be with me? He, no doubt, places this ground of comfort in opposition to the sorrow which he might well apprehend from the dreadful tokens of the divine displeasure, which he has enumerated in the preceding verse. The <i>prayer</i> of which he speaks 			 in the end of the verse is not to be understood as the prayer of an afflicted or sorrowful man; but it comprehends an expression of the delight which is experienced when God, by manifesting his favor to us, gives us free access into his presence. And, therefore, he also calls him <i>the God of his life,</i> because from the knowledge of this arises cheerfulness of heart.</p>  <a name="viii.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="viii.iv-p6"></a><b>9.</b> <i>I will say to God my rock</i> If we read the preceding verse in the past tense, the meaning of this verse will be, Since God has, in this way, heretofore shown himself so kind towards me, I will pray to him now with so much the greater confidence: for the experience which I have had of 			 his goodness will inspire me with courage. But if the preceding verse is rendered in the future tense, David, in this verse, combines the prayer which it contains with the reflections which faith led him to make. And, surely, whoever, from a persuasion of the paternal love of God, anticipates for himself the same favor which David has just described, will also be induced from his example to pray for it with greater confidence. The meaning, then, will be this: Since I expect that God will be 			 favorable to me, inasmuch as by day he manifests his favor towards me, and continues to do this, so that even by night I have occasion to praise him, I will bewail the more frankly my miseries before him, saying, <i>O</i> <i>Lord! my rock, why hast thou forgotten me? </i>In making such a complaint, the faithful are not to be understood as meaning that God has utterly rejected them: for if they did not believe 			 that they were under his care and protection, it were in vain for them to call upon him. But they speak in this manner according to the sense of the flesh. This forgetfulness, then, relates both to outward appearance, and to the disquietude by which the faithful are troubled according to the flesh, although, in the meantime, they rest assured by faith that God regards them, and will not be deaf to their request.</p>

 <p><a name="viii.iv-p8"></a><b>10</b>  <i>It is as a slaughter in my bones.</i> This verse is somewhat involved in point of expression; but as to the meaning of it there is no obscurity. David here affirms that the grief which he experienced from the reproaches of his enemies, wounded him in no degree 			 less than if they had pierced through his bones. The word <a name="viii.iv-p8.1"></a>ברצה<i>, beretsach, </i>signifies <i>killing; </i>and, therefore, I have retained this idea in the translation of it. And yet I do not condemn the opinion of those who render it <i>a slaughtering sword.</i>   			  <a name="fr_123"></a><a href="#fn_123"><font size="1">124</font></a>
  			  There is here a difference as to the reading, arising from the great similarity which there is between the two letters <a name="viii.iv-p9.5"></a>ב<i>, beth, </i>and <a name="viii.iv-p9.6"></a>כ<i>, caph, </i>the mark of similitude. As the letter 			 <a name="viii.iv-p9.7"></a>ב <i>beth, </i>is often superfluous, I would rather be disposed, in a doubtful matter like this, to omit it altogether. But as I have said, the sense is perfectly plain, except that interpreters do not seem to take this sufficiently into their consideration, that by the terms <i>my 			 bones, </i>the bitterness of grief is referred to; for we feel much more acutely any injury which is done to the bones, than if a sword should pierce the bowels, or the other parts of the body which are soft and yielding. Nor should the children of God regard this similitude as hyperbolical; and if one should wonder why David took so sorely to heart the derision of his enemies, he only manifests in this his own insensibility. For of all 			 the bitter evils which befall us, there is nothing which can inflict upon us a severer wound than to see the wicked tear in pieces the majesty of God, and endeavor to destroy and overturn our faith. The doctrine taught by Paul, (<a name="viii.iv-p9.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#024">Ga 4:24</a><a name="viii.iv-p9.8"></a>,) concerning the persecution of Ishmael, is well known. Many consider his childish jesting as of little moment, but as it tended to this effect, 			 that the covenant of God should be esteemed as a thing of no value, it is on that account, according to the judgment of the Holy Spirit, to be accounted a most cruel persecution. David, therefore, with much propriety, compares to a slaughtering sword, which penetrates even within the bones and marrow, the derision of his enemies, by which he saw his own faith and the word of God trampled under foot. And would to God that all who boast themselves of being his children would learn to bear their 			 private wrongs more patiently, and to manifest the same vehement zeal for which David is here distinguished, when their faith is assailed to the dishonor of God, and when the word also which gives them life is included in the same reproach!</p>

 <p><a name="viii.iv-p11"></a><b>11</b>  <i>O my soul! why art thou cast down?</i> This repetition shows us that David had not so completely overcome his temptations in one encounter, or by one extraordinary effort, as to render it unnecessary for him to enter anew into the same conflict. By this 			 example, therefore, we are admonished, that although Satan, by his assaults, often subjects us to a renewal of the same trouble, we ought not to lose our courage, or allow ourselves to be cast down. The latter part of this verse differs from the fifth verse in one word, while in every other respect they agree. In the fifth verse, it is the <i>helps of</i> His <i>countenance, </i>but here we have the relative pronoun of the first person, thus, <i>The helps of</i> My <i>countenance</i> Perhaps in this place, the letter 			 <i>w</i>, <i>vau, </i>which in the Hebrew language denotes the third person, is wanting. Still, as all the other versions agree in the reading which I have adopted,   			  <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">125</font></a>
  			  David might, without any absurdity, call God by this designation, <i>The helps</i> or <i>salvations of</i> My <i>countenance, 			 </i>inasmuch as he looked with confidence for a deliverance, manifest and certain, as if God should appear in a visible manner as his defender, and the protector of his welfare. There can, however, be no doubt, that in this place the term <i>helps or salvations</i> is to be viewed as an epithet applied to God; for immediately after it follows, <i>and my God</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="viii.i-p3"></a> Horsley also reads, “crieth.” In the Hebrew it is “brayeth.” In Hebrew there are distinct words to mark the peculiar cries of the hart, the bear, the lion, the zebra, the wolf, the horse, the dog, the cow, and the sheep. The distressing cry of the hart seems to be here expressed. Being naturally of a hot and sanguine constitution, it suffers much from thirst in the Oriental regions. When in want of water, and unable to find 						it, it makes a mournful noise, and eagerly seeks the cooling river; and especially when pursued over the dry and parched wilderness by the hunter, it seeks the stream of water with intense desire, and braying plunges into it with eagerness, as soon as it has reached its wished-for banks, at once to quench its thirst and escape its deadly pursuers. It is the female hart which is here meant, as “brayeth” is feminine, and as the reading of the LXX. also shows, which is, <a name="viii.i-p3.1"></a>ἡ ἔλσφος</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="viii.ii-p4"></a> In this verse, there is evidently a reference to the festive religious solemnities of the Jews, in which singing and dancing were used. These also formed an eminent part of the religious rites of the ancient Greeks and other heathen nations. Among the Greeks at the present day, it is the practice for a lady of distinction to lead the dance, and to be followed by a troop of young females, who imitate her steps, and if she sings, make up the 						chorus. This serves to throw light on the description given of Miriam, when she “took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women went out after her with timbrels and dances,” (<a name="viii.ii-p4.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo015.htm#020">Ex 15:20</a><a name="viii.ii-p4.1"></a>.) She led the dance; they followed and imitated her steps. When David “danced before the Lord” at the bringing up of the ark, “with shouting and with the sound of the trumpet,” it is probable that he was accompanied by others 						whom he led in the dance, (<a name="viii.ii-p4.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#015">2 Sam. 6:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2006.htm#016">16</a><a name="viii.ii-p4.2"></a>.) To this practice there is evidently an allusion in this passage; and the allusion greatly enhances its beauty.</p>

So great is the quantity of water, and so sudden and precipitate the fall, that 						if it happen to break on a vessel, it shatters it to pieces, and sinks it in an instant. Those waterspouts which Dr Shaw saw in the Mediterranean, he informs us, “seemed to be so many cylinders of water falling down from the clouds;” and he states, that they “are more frequent near the capes of Latikea, Greego, and Carmel, than in any other part of the Mediterranean.” — (<i>Travels</i>, p. 333.) “These are all places,” as Harmer observes, “on the coast of Syria, and the last of them every body 						knows in Judea, it being a place rendered famous by the prayers of the prophet Elijah. The Jews then could not be ignorant of what happened on their coasts; and David must have known of these dangers of the sea, if he had not actually seen some of them.” — (<i>Observations</i>, volume 3, p. 222.) In the description of a violent and dangerous storm at sea, by which he here portrays his great distress, he would, therefore, naturally draw his imagery from these awful phenomena, which were 						of frequent occurrence on the Jewish coasts.</p>
