 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN13"><a name="xiii-p1"></a>PSALM 47</p>  		
 <p><a name="xiii-p2"></a>Some think that this psalm was composed at the time when the temple was dedicated, and the ark of the covenant placed in the sanctuary. But as this is a conjecture which has little to support it, it is better, if I am not mistaken, instead of detaining ourselves with this, to consider the subject-matter of the psalm, and the use to which it ought especially to be applied. It was no doubt appointed for the stated holy assemblies, as may be easily 		  gathered from the whole tenor of the poem; and perhaps it was composed by David, and delivered by him to the Levites, to be sung by them before the temple was built, and when the ark as yet abode in the tabernacle. But whoever was its author, he exhorts not only the Israelites, but also all nations, to worship the only true God. It chiefly magnifies the favor which, according to the state of things at that time, God had graciously vouchsafed to the offspring of Abraham; and salvation to the 		  whole world was to proceed from this source. It however contains, at the same time, a prophecy of the future kingdom of Christ. It teaches that the glory which then shone under the figure of the material sanctuary will diffuse its splendor far and wide; when God himself will cause the beams of his grace to shine into distant lands, that kings and nations may be united into fellowship with the children of Abraham.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.i-p6"></a><b>1.</b> <i>Clap your hands, all ye peoples</i> As the Psalmist requires the nations, in token of their joy and of their thanksgiving; to God, to clap their hands, or rather exhorts them to a more than ordinary joy, the vehemence of which breaks forth and manifests itself by external expressions, it 			 is certain that he is here speaking of the deliverance which God had wrought for them. Had God erected among the Gentiles some formidable kingdom, this would rather have deprived all of their courage, and overwhelmed them with despair, than given them matter to sing and leap for joy. Besides, the inspired writer does not here treat of some common or ordinary blessings of God; but of such blessings as will fill the whole world with incredible joy, and stir up the minds of all men to celebrate 			 the praises of God. What he adds a little after, that all nations were brought into subjection to Israel, must, therefore, necessarily be understood not of slavish subjection, but of a subjection which is more excellent, and more to be desired, than all the kingdoms of the world. It would be unnatural for those who are subdued and brought to submit by force and fear to leap for joy. Many nations were tributary to David, and to his son Solomon; but while they were so, they ceased not, at the 			 same time, to murmur, and bore impatiently the yoke which was imposed upon them, so far were they from giving thanks to God with joyful and cheerful hearts.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.i-p7"></a><a name="xiii.i-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p8"></a>Since, then, no servitude is happy and desirable but that by which God subdues and brings under the standard and authority of Christ his Son those who before were rebels, it follows that this language is applicable only to the kingdom of Christ, who is called <i>a high and terrible King, </i>(verse 2;) not that he makes 			 the wretched beings over whom he reigns to tremble by the tyranny and violence of his sway, but because his majesty, which before had been held in contempt, will suffice to quell the rebellion of the whole world. It is to be observed, that the design of the Holy Spirit is here to teach, that as the Jews had been long contumeliously treated, oppressed with wrongs, and afflicted from time to time with divers calamities, the goodness and liberality of God towards them was now so much the more 			 illustrious, when the kingdom of David had subdued the neighboring nations on every sidle, and had attained to such a height of glory. We may, however, easily gather from the connection of the words the truth of what I have suggested, that when God is called <i>a terrible and great King over all the earth, </i>this prophecy applies to the kingdom of Christ. There is, therefore, no doubt, 			 that the grace of God was celebrated by these titles, to strengthen the hearts of the godly during the period that intervened till the advent of Christ, in which not only the triumphant state of the people of Israel had fallen into decay, but in which also the people, being oppressed with the bitterest contumely, could have no taste of the favor of God, and no consolation from it, but by relying on the promises of God alone. We know that there was a long interruption of the splendor of the 			 kingdom of God’s ancient people, which continued from the death of Solomon to the coming of Christ. This interval formed, as it were, a gulf or chasm, which would have swallowed up the minds of the godly, had they not been supported and upheld by the Word of God. As, therefore, God exhibited in the person of David a type of the kingdom of Christ, which is here extolled, although there followed shortly after a sad and almost shameful diminution of the glory of David’s kingdom, then the most 			 grievous calamities, and, finally, the captivity and a most miserable dispersion, which differed little from a total destruction, the Holy Spirit has exhorted the faithful to continue clapping their hands for joy, until the advent of the promised Redeemer.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.i-p10"></a><b>3.</b> <i>He hath set in order the people under us</i> Some translate the verb <i>he hath subjected; </i>and this agrees with the translation which I have given. Others translate it <i>he hath led, </i>which is 			 somewhat more remote from the meaning. But to understand the verb <a name="xiii.i-p10.1"></a>ידבר, <i>yadebber, </i>as meaning <i>to destroy, </i>as is done by others, is altogether at variance with the mind of the prophet; for it is doubtless an advantageous, joyful, and desirable subjection which is here meant. In the Hebrew, the 			 verb is in the future tense, <i>he will set in order; </i>and if any are disposed to prefer retaining it in this tense, I have no great objection to it. As, however, it is certain that under the figure of the kingdom of David there is here celebrated the grace of God to come, I have readily adopted that rendering which has been preferred by other interpreters. Besides, although in this verse the prophet especially exhorts his own countrymen to 			 gratitude to God, because, through his favor, they ruled over all people; yet it is certain that he means, that those also who were subdued are associated with the Jews in this joy. The body does not differ more from the shadow than the reigned expressions of joy with which the heathen nations honored David in old time, differ from those with which the faithful through the whole world   			  <a name="fr_183"></a><a href="#fn_183"><font size="1">184</font></a>
  			  receive Christ,; for the latter flow from the willing obedience of the heart. And assuredly, if after the ark was brought to the temple, there had not appeared hidden under this figure something far higher, which formed the substance of it:, it would have been as it were a childish joy to assign to God his dwelling there, and to shut him up within such narrow limits. But when the majesty of God which had dwelt in the tabernacle was manifested to the whole world, and 			 when all nations were brought in subjection to his authority, this prerogative of the offspring of Abraham was then illustriously manifested. The prophet, then, when he declares that the Gentiles Will be subdued, so that they will not refuse to obey the chosen people, is describing that kingdom of which he had previously spoken. We are not to suppose that he here treats of that secret providence by which God governs the whole world, but of the special power which he exercises by means of his 			 word; and, therefore, in order that he may be properly called a King, his own people must necessarily acknowledge him as such. It may, however, be asked, “Since Christ has brought the Church under his own authority and celestial power, in what sense can it be said that the nations are subject to the Jews, seeing we know that the order of the Church cannot be settled aright, and as it ought to be, unless Christ the only head stand forth prominently above all, and all the faithful, from the 			 greatest to the least, keep themselves in the humble rank of members? Nay, more, when Christ erected his dominion through the whole world, the adoption, which had before been the peculiar privilege of one people, began to be the common privilege of all nations; and by this means liberty was granted to all together, that being united to one another by the ties of true brotherhood, they should aspire to the celestial inheritance.” The answer to this is easy: When the yoke of the law,   			  <a name="fr_184"></a><a href="#fn_184"><font size="1">185</font></a>
  			  was imposed upon the Gentiles, the Jews then obtained the sovereignty over them; even as by the word the pastors of the Church exercise the jurisdiction of the Holy Spirit. For this very reason the Church is called a Queen, and the Mother of all the godly, (<a name="xiii.i-p12.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#026">Ga 4:26</a><a name="xiii.i-p12.2"></a>,) because divine truth, which is like a scepter to subdue us all, has been committed 			 to her keeping. Although then the Jews, when the kingdom of Christ emerged into light, were in a state of wretched and ignominious servitude to heathen nations, and had been, as it were, their slaves; yet the sovereignty is truly and justly attributed to them, because God “sent the rod of his strength out of Zion,” (<a name="xiii.i-p12.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002">Ps 110:2</a><a name="xiii.i-p12.3"></a>;) and as 			 they were intrusted with the keeping of the la their office was to restrain and subdue the Gentiles by its authority. The only way by which the rest of the world has been brought into subjection to God is, that men, being renewed by the Spirit of God, have willingly yielded themselves docile and tractable to the Jews, and suffered themselves to be under their dominion; as it is said in another passage,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.i-p13"></a>“In those days it shall come to pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew,saying, We will go with you;for we have heard that God is with you,” (<a name="xiii.i-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac008.htm#023">Zec 8:23</a><a name="xiii.i-p13.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.i-p14"></a><a name="xiii.i-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p15"></a><b>4.</b> <i>He hath chosen our inheritance for us.</i> The inspired poet here celebrates more distinctly the special grace which God, in his goodness, had bestowed upon the chosen and holy seed of Abraham. As he passed by all the rest of the word, and adopted to himself a people who were few in 			 number and contemptible; so it was proper that such a signal pledge of his fatherly love should be distinguished from his common beneficence, which is extended to all mankind without distinction. The word <i>chosen</i> is therefore peculiarly emphatic, implying that God had not dealt with the children of Abraham as he had been accustomed indiscriminately to deal with other nations; but 			 that he had bestowed upon them, as it were by <i>hereditary </i>right, a peculiar dignity by which they excelled all others. The same thing is expressed immediately after by the word <i>glory</i> Thus then the prophet enjoins the duty of thanksgiving to God, for having exalted, in the person of Jacob, his chosen people to the highest degree of 			 honor, so that they might boast that their condition was distinguished from that of all other nations. He shows, at the same time, that this was entirely owing to the free and unmerited favor of God. The relative pronoun <i>whom</i> is put instead of the causal particle <i>for</i> or <i>because, </i>as if the Psalmist had attributed the cause of this prerogative by which they were distinguished to God himself. Whenever the favor of God towards the Jews is commended, in consequence of his having loved their fathers, this principle should always be kept in mind, that hereby all merits in man are annihilated. If all the excellence or glory of the holy patriarch depended purely and simply upon the good pleasure of God, 			 who can dare to arrogate any thing to himself as peculiarly his own? If God then has given us any thing above others, and as it were by special privilege, let us learn to ascribe the whole to the fatherly love which he bears towards seeing he has chosen us to be his flock. We also gather from this passage that the grace which God displays towards his chosen is not extended to all men in common, but is a privilege by which he distinguishes a few from the great mass of mankind.</p>  <a name="xiii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p5"></a><b>5.</b> <i>God is gone up with triumph</i> There is here an allusion to the ancient ceremony which was observed under the Law. As the sound of trumpets was wont to be used in solemnising the holy assemblies, the prophet says that God <i>goes 			 up, </i>when the trumpets encourage and stir up the people to magnify and extol his power. When this ceremony was performed in old time, it was just as if a king, making his entrance among his subjects, presented himself to them in magnificent attire and great splendor, by which he gained their admiration and reverence. At the same time, the sacred writer, under that shadowy ceremony, doubtless intended to lead us to consider another 			 kind of going up more triumphant — that of Christ when he “ascended up far above all heavens,” (<a name="xiii.ii-p5.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#010">Eph 4:10</a><a name="xiii.ii-p5.1"></a>) and obtained the empire of the whole world, and armed with his celestial power, subdued all pride and loftiness. You must remember what I have adverted to before, that the name <i>Jehovah 			 </i>is here applied to the ark; for although the essence or majesty of God was not shut up in it, nor his power and operation fixed to it, yet it was not a vain and idle symbol of his presence. God had promised that he would dwell in the midst of the people so long as the Jews worshipped him according to the rule which he had prescribed in the Law; and he actually showed that he was truly present with them, and that it was not in vain that he was called upon among them. 			 What is here stated, however, applies more properly to the manifestation of the glory which at length shone forth in the person of Christ. In short, the import of the Psalmist’s language is, When the trumpets sounded among the Jews, according to the appointment of the Law, that was not a mere empty sound which vanished away in the air; for God, who intended the ark of the covenant to be a pledge and token of his presence, truly presided in that assembly. From this the prophet draws an argument 			 for enforcing on the faithful the duty of <i>singing praises to God</i> He argues, that by engaging in this exercise they will not be acting blindly or at random, as the superstitious, who, having no certainty in their false systems of religion, lament and howl in vain before their idols. He shows that the faithful have just ground for celebrating with their mouths and with a cheerful 			 heart the praises of God;   			  <a name="fr_185"></a><a href="#fn_185"><font size="1">186</font></a>
  			  since they certainly know that he is as present with them, as if he had visibly established his royal throne among them.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p7"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p7.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p8"></a><b>7.</b> <i>For God is King of all the earth</i> The Psalmist, having called God in the close of the preceding verse <i>King</i> of the chosen people, now calls him <i>King</i> <i>of all the earth; </i>and thus, while he claims to the Jews the right and honor of primogeniture, he at the same time joins to them the Gentiles as associates and partakers with them of the same blessing. By these words he intimates that the kingdom of God would be much more magnificent and glorious at the 			 coming of the Messiah, than it was under the shadowy dispensation of the Law, inasmuch as it would be extended to the utmost boundaries of the earth. To show the greater earnestness in his exhortation, he repeats the words, <i>Sing praises to God, </i>five times. The word <a name="xiii.ii-p8.1"></a>מםכיל, 			 <i>maskil,</i>   			  <a name="fr_186"></a><a href="#fn_186"><font size="1">187</font></a>
  			  is put in the singular number instead of the plural; for he invites to this exercise all who are skillful in singing. He, no doubt, speaks of knowledge in the art of music; but he requires, at the same time, the worshippers of God to sing the praises of God intelligently, that there may not be the mere sound of tongues, as we know to be the case among the Papists. Knowledge of what is sung is required in order to engage in a proper manner in 			 the singing of psalms, that the name of God may not be profaned, as it would certainly be, were there nothing more but the voice which melts away or is dissolved in the air.   			  <a name="fr_187"></a><a href="#fn_187"><font size="1">188</font></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p12"></a><b>8.</b> <i>He hath obtained the kingdom over the heathen</i> Literally it is, <i>He hath reigned; </i>but as the verb <a name="xiii.ii-p12.1"></a>מלך, <i>malach, </i>is in the past tense, which in Hebrew denotes a continued act, we have translated it, <i>He hath obtained the kingdom</i> The prophet repeatedly informs us that God reigns over the Gentiles; and from this it is easy to gather that he here treats of a new and a previously unheard of manner of reigning. There is an implied contrast between the 			 time of the Law, when God confined his empire, or kingdom, within the boundaries of Judea, and the coming of Christ, when he extended it far and wide, so as to occupy the whole world from one end to the other. The majesty of God sent forth some sparks of its brightness among the heathen nations, when David made them tributary; but the prophet could not, on that account, have properly said that God reigned among them, since they both contemned his worship and the true religion, and also wished 			 to see the Church completely extinguished. To find the fulfillment of this prophecy, we must, therefore, necessarily come to Christ. What is added in the second clause of the verse, <i>God sitteth upon the throne of his holiness,</i> may be taken in a twofold sense. By this form of expression is often to be understood <i>the tabernacle, </i>or 			 <i>the temple; </i>but it also sometimes signifies <i>heaven. </i>If any are inclined to explain it of <i>the temple, </i>the meaning will be, That while God reigned over the whole world, and comprehended all nations under his dominion, he had established his chief seat at Jerusalem; and it was from thence that the doctrine of the gospel, by which he has brought under 			 his dominion all people, flowed. We may, however, very properly take this expression as spoken of heaven<i>; </i>and thus the sense will be, That God, in stretching forth his hand to subdue men, and bring them to submit to his authority, evidently shows that, from his heavenly throne, he reigns over men. Unless he show men his power and working by signs manifest and near at hand, he is not acknowledged as Governor of the world.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xiii.ii-p13"></a><a name="xiii.ii-p13.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p14"></a><b>9</b>  <i>The princes of the peoples are gathered together.</i> The Psalmist enriches and amplifies by various expressions the preceding sentence. He again declares that the way in which God obtained dominion over the Gentiles was, that those who before were aliens 			 united in the adoption of the same faith with the Jews; and thus different nations, from a state of miserable dispersion, were gathered together into one body. When the doctrine of the Gospel was manifested and shone forth, it did not remove the Jews from the covenant which God had long before made with them. On the contrary, it has rather joined us to them. As then the calling of the Gentiles was nothing else than the means by which they were grafted and incorporated into the family of 			 Abraham, the prophet justly states, that strangers or aliens from every direction <i>were gathered together</i> to the chosen people, that by such an increase the kingdom of God might be extended through all quarters of the globe. On this account Paul says, (<a name="xiii.ii-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph003.htm#006">Eph 3:6</a><a name="xiii.ii-p14.1"></a>,) 			 that the Gentiles were made one body with the Jews, that they might be partakers of the everlasting inheritance. By the abolition of the ceremonies of the Mosaic economy, “the middle wall of partitions” which made a separation between the Jews and the Gentiles, is now removed, (<a name="xiii.ii-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#014">Eph 2:14</a><a name="xiii.ii-p14.2"></a>;) but it nevertheless remains true, that 			 we are not accounted among the children of God unless we have been grafted into the stock of Abraham. The prophet does not merely speak of the common people: he also tells us that princes themselves will regard it as the height of their felicity to be gathered together with the Jews; as we shall see in another psalm, (<a name="xiii.ii-p14.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#005">Ps 87:5</a><a name="xiii.ii-p14.3"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xiii.ii-p15"></a>“And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in her.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p16"></a>Farther, it is said that this gathering together will be <i>to the people of the God of Abraham, </i>to teach us that it is not here meant to attribute to the Jews any superiority which they naturally possess above others, but that all their excellence depends upon this, that the pure worship of God flourishes among 			 them, and that they hold heavenly doctrine in high estimation. This, therefore, is not spoken of the bastard or cast-off Jews, whom their own unbelief has cut off from the Church. But as, according to the statement of the Apostle Paul, (<a name="xiii.ii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016">Ro 11:16</a><a name="xiii.ii-p16.1"></a>,) the root being holy, the branches are also holy, it follows that the falling away of the greater part does not prevent this honor from 			 continuing to belong to the rest. Accordingly, the “consumption” which, as is stated in the prophecy of Isaiah, overflowed the whole earth, is called the people of the God of Abraham, (chapter 10:22, 23.) This passage contains two very important and instructive truths. In the first place, we learn from it, that all who would be reckoned among the children of God ought to seek to have a place in the Church, and to join themselves to it, that they may maintain fraternal unity with all the godly; 			 and, secondly, that when the unity of the Church is spoken of, it is to be considered as consisting in nothing else but an unfeigned agreement to yield obedience to the word of God, that there may be one sheepfold and one Shepherd. Moreover, those who are exalted in the world in respect of honors and riches, are here admonished to divest themselves of all pride, and willingly and submissively to bear the yoke in common with others, that they may show themselves the obedient children of the 			 Church.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p17"></a>What follows immediately after, <i>The shields of the earth are God’s, </i>is understood by many as spoken of princes.   			  <a name="fr_188"></a><a href="#fn_188"><font size="1">189</font></a>
  			  I admit that this metaphor is of frequent occurrence in Scripture, nor does this sense seem to be unsuitable to the scope of the passage. It is as if the prophet had said, It is in the power of God to ingraft into his Church the great ones of the world whenever he pleases; for he reigns over them also. Yet the sense will be more simple if we explain the words thus: That, as it is God alone who defends and preserves the world, the high and supreme majesty, which is 			 sufficient for so exalted and difficult a work as the preservation of the <i>world, </i>is justly looked upon with admiration. The sacred writer expressly uses the word <i>shields</i> in the plural number, for, considering the various and almost innumerable dangers which 			 unceasingly threaten every part of the world, the providence of God must necessarily interpose in many ways, and make use, as it were, of many bucklers.</p>
