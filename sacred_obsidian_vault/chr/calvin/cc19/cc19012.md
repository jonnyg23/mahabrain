 <p><a name="xiii.i-p3"></a><b>1 </b>And Pashur the son of Immer the priest, (and he was a governor in the Temple of Jehovah,) heard Jeremiah prophesying these words:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p4"></a><b>2</b> And Pashur smote Jeremiah the Prophet, and put him in the prison which was in the higher gate of Benjamin, opposite the house of Jehovah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>And it happened the day after, that Pashur brought out Jeremiah from prison; and Jeremiah said to him, — Not Pashur has Jehovah called thy name, But terror on every side:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>For thus saith Jehovah, — Behold, I will make thee a terror To thyself and to all thy friends; And fall shall they by the sword of thine enemies, While thine eyes are looking on; And all Judah will I deliver Into the hand of the king of Babylon; And he shall carry them into Babylon, And shall smite them with the sword:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And I will give up all the strength of this city, And all its labor and its every precious thing; And all the treasures of the kings of Judah Will I give up into the hands of their enemies; And they shall spoil them and take them away, And they shall lead them into Babylon.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And thou, Pashur, and all the inhabitants of thy house, Go shall ye into captivity; Thou shalt come to Babylon, and there die, And there shalt thou be buried and thy friends, To whom thou hast falsely prophesied.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Thou hast deceived me, Jehovah, and I was deceived; Thou hast constrained me and didst prevail; I am become a scorn all the day, All make a mock of me;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>For from the time I have spoken, I cried aloud against violence, And devastation have I proclaimed: Because the word of Jehovah became to me A reproach and derision all the day,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Therefore I said, I will not mention <i>him, </i>Nor speak any more in his name: But it became in my heart as a burning fire, Closed up in my bones; And I was wearied with forbearing, And I did not prevail.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For I heard the slander of many, Terror on every side, “Report ye, and we will report to him:” All my friends watch for my haltings — “He may go astray, then we shall prevail against him, And take our revenge on him.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>But Jehovah is with me as a terrible giant; Therefore my persecutors shall fall and not prevail; They shall be greatly ashamed, for they shall not succeed; <i>It will be </i>a perpetual reproach Which shall not be forgotten.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>But thou, Jehovah of hosts, <i>Art he </i>who provest the righteous, Who seest the reins and the heart; I shall see thy vengeance on them, For to thee have I opened my cause.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Sing ye to Jehovah, praise ye Jehovah, For he has rescued the soul of the distressed From the hand of the wicked.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Cursed <i>be</i> the day on which I was born; The day on which my mother bare me, Let it not be blessed:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Cursed <i>be </i>the man who told my father, Saying, “Born to thee is a male child,” Who with joy made him joyful;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p18"></a><b>16 </b>And let that man be as the cities, Which Jehovah destroyed and repented not; And let him hear a cry in the morning, And a tumult at noontide.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.i-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Why hast thou not slain me from the womb? That my mother might be my grave, Or her womb a perpetual conception?</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Inquire now for us of Jehovah, for Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon makes war with us, if Jehovah will deal with us according to his wondrous works, that he may ascend from us.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>And Jeremiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, God of Israel, — Behold, I prohibit all the warlike instruments Which are in your hands, with which ye fight Against the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans, Who besiege you without the walls; And I will gather them into the midst of this city:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And fight will I myself against you With an extended hand and with a strong arm, Yea, in wrath and fury and great indignation;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, Both man and beast; By a great pestilence shall they die.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>And afterwards Jehovah said, — I will deliver Zedekiah the king of Judah. His servants also and the people, Even those who shall remain in the city, From the pestilence, and the sword, and the famine, Into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, And into the hand of their enemies, And into the hand of those who seek their life; And he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; And he will not 			 spare them, Nor forgive, nor shew mercy.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>To this people also shalt thou say, — Thus saith Jehovah, — Behold, I set before you The way of life and the way of death:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>He who abides in this city shall die By the sword, or by famine, or by pestilence; But he who goeth out and dwells With the Chaldeans who besiege you, Shall live, and his life shall be for a prey:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For I have set my face against this city, For evil and not for good, saith Jehovah; Into the hand of the king of Babylon shall it be given, And he shall burn it with fire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>And as to the house of the king of Judah, Hear ye the word of Jehovah;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>O house of David, thus saith Jehovah, — In the morning execute ye judgment, And free the spoiled from the hand of the oppressor, Lest go forth as fire my indignation, And burn, and there be none to extinguish it, — Because of the wickedness of their doings.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Behold, I am against thee, inhabitant of the valley — The rock in the plain, saith Jehovah, Who say, “Who shall descend to us? And who shall enter our habitations?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.ii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>I will even visit upon you The fruit of your doings, saith Jehovah; And I will kindle a fire in its forest, And it shall consume all around it.</p>  <a name="xiii.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p4"></a><b>2</b> And say, — Hear the word of Jehovah, king of Judah, Who sittest on the throne of David, Thou, and thy servants, and thy people, Who enter in through these gates:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, Do judgment and justice, And rescue the spoiled from the hand of the oppressor; The stranger, the orphan, and the widow, Defraud not; exercise no violence, Nor shed innocent blood in this place.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>For if obeying ye obey this word, Then shall enter through the gates of this house Kings, sitting for David on his throne, Riding in chariots and on horses, — He himself, and his servants, and his people:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>But if ye will not obey these words, By myself have I sworn, saith Jehovah, That a waste shall this house become.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>For thus saith Jehovah of the house of the king of Judah, Gilead to me art thou, the head of Lebanon; Surely I will make thee a desert, As cities which are not inhabited:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>And I will prepare against thee destroyers, Every man and his instruments, And they shall cut down thy choice cedars, And cast them into the fire.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>And pass shall many nations through this city, And say shall each to his friend, “Why hath Jehovah done thus to this great city?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>And they shall say, “Because they have forsaken The covenant of Jehovah their God, And bowed down before alien gods, and served them.”</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>For in the land where they shall lead him away There shall he die, And this land shall he see no more.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Woe to him who builds not with justice his house, And not with judgment his chambers; Who makes his neighbor to serve him for nothing, And pays him not for his work;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Who says, “I will build for myself A large house and wide chambers;” And he perforates for himself windows, And covered it is with cedar, And painted with vermilion.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Shalt thou reign because thou inclosest thyself in cedar? Thy father, did he not eat and drink? When he did judgment and justice, It was then well with him:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>He judged the cause of the poor and needy, It was then well <i>with him; </i>Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah:</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>With the burial of an ass shall he be buried, Drawn out and cast forth Beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Concerning the pastors who feed my people, — Ye have scattered my flock and driven them away, And ye have not visited them; Behold, I will visit upon you The wickedness of your doings, saith Jehovah:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p5"></a><b>3 </b>But I will gather the remnant of my sheep From all the lands to which I shall drive them, And cause them to return to their own folds, And they shall become fruitful and multiply;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p6"></a><b>4 </b>And I will raise up over them pastors Who shall feed them; And they shall no more fear nor dread, Nor shall they fail, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Behold, the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will raise up to David a righteous branch, And reign shall a king, And prudently shall he act; He will do judgment and justice in the land.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p10"></a><b>8 </b>But rather, “Live does Jehovah,” who has brought up And led the seed of the house of Israel From the land of the north, and all the lands To which I had driven them; And they shall dwell in their own land.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p11"></a><b>9 </b>On account of the prophets, Broken is my heart within me, Disjointed are all my bones; I am become like a drunken man Who has been overcome by wine, On account of Jehovah, And on account of the words of his holiness;</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.iv-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts Concerning these prophets, — I will feed them with a deadly poison, And give them waters of gall to drink; For from the prophets of Jerusalem Has gone forth impiety through all the laud.</p>

 <p><a name="xiii.x-p9"></a><b>7 </b>And seek the peace of the city, To which I have removed you; And pray for it to Jehovah, For in its peace shall be your peace.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p10"></a><b>8 </b>For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, — Let not your prophets who are in the midst of you, Nor your diviners, deceive you; And attend not to your dreams which ye dream:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p11"></a><b>9 </b>For they falsely prophesy to you in my name; I have not sent them, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For thus saith Jehovah, — For when completed in Babylon Shall be seventy years, I will visit you, And will rouse up for you my good word, That I may bring you back to this place:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p13"></a><b>11 </b>For I know my thoughts, Which I think of you, saith Jehovah, — Thoughts of peace and not of evil, To give you the end and the expectation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p14"></a><b>12 </b>And ye shall call on me and go forward; And pray to me, and I will hear you:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p15"></a><b>13 </b>And ye shall seek me, and shall find <i>me; </i>Because ye will seek me with the whole heart.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p16"></a><b>14 </b>And I will be found by your saith Jehovah, And will restore your captivity, And will gather you from all nations, And from all places, where I have driven you, Saith Jehovah, and I will bring you back To the place whence I have expelled you.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p17"></a><b>15 </b>As ye have said, “Raise for us will Jehovah prophets in Babylon;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p18"></a><b>16</b> Therefore thus saith Jehovah to the king who sits on the throne of David, and to the whole people who dwell in this city, to your brethren who have not gone forth with you into exile, — thus saith Jehovah of hosts, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Behold, I will send upon them the sword, The famine, and the pestilence, And will make them like worthless figs, Which, being so bad, cannot be eaten:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p20"></a><b>18 </b>Yea, I will pursue them with the sword, The famine, and the pestilence, And will set them for a commotion To all the kingdoms of the earth, For a curse and for an astonishment, And for a hissing and for a reproach, Among all the nations to whom I shall drive them;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Because they hearkened not to my words, saith Jehovah, Which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, Rising up early and sending; And ye hearkened not, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Hear ye also the word of Jehovah, the whole captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p23"></a><b>21</b> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy to you in my name a lie, — Behold, I will deliver them into the hand Of Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, And he shall kill them before your eyes:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p24"></a><b>22 </b>And taken from them shall be a curse By all the captivity of Judah in Babylon, saying, — “Let Jehovah make thee like Zedekiah and Ahab, Whom the king of Babylon burnt in the fire:”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p25"></a><b>23 </b>Because they have done villainy in Israel, And prostituted the wives of their friends, And spoke a word in my name falsely, Which I had not commanded them; But I know, and am witness, saith Jehovah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p26"></a><b>24 </b>And as to Shemaiah, the Nehelamite, thou shalt thus say, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p27"></a><b>25 </b>Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, — Because thou hast sent in my name letters to the whole people, who are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah, the son of Maaseiah, the priest, and to all the priests, saying, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p28"></a><b>26 </b>Jehovah hath made thee a priest in the room of Jehoiada the priest, that ye might be the rulers of the house of Jehovah over every one that is insane and prophesies, that thou mightest put him in prison and in manacles:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p29"></a><b>27</b> And thou — wherefore hast thou not reproved Jeremiah, the Anathothite, who prophesies to you?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p30"></a><b>28 </b>Even because he hath sent to us in Babylon, saying, — “Long is the time, build ye houses and inhabit them;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p31"></a><b>29 </b>Plant gardens and eat the fruit of them.” (Now Zephaniah had read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet:)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p32"></a><b>30 </b>Therefore the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p33"></a><b>31 </b>Send to the whole captivity, saying, — Thus saith Jehovah of Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, When I had not sent him, And has made you to trust in falsehood;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xiii.x-p34"></a><b>32 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, — Lo I will visit Shemaiah the Nehelamite and his seed; There shall not be to him a man To dwell in the midst of this people; And he shall not see the good, Which I shall do to my people, saith Jehovah; Because he has spoken rebellion against Jehovah.</p>
