 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN08"><a name="xxi-p3"></a>THE EPISTLE TO THE HEBREWS</p>  <a name="xxi.i"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.i-p2"></a>CHAPTER 1</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p3"></a><b>1 </b>God having formerly spoken many times and in many ways to the fathers by the prophets,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Has in these last days spoken to us by the Son, whom he has constituted the heir of all things, by whom also he made the worlds;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Who being the effulgence of his glory, and the impress of his person, and sustaining all things by his powerful word, having by himself effected the purgation of our sins, sat down on the right hand of Majesty on high;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Being so much superior to the angels, as he has inherited a name more excellent than they.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>For to whom of the angels has he ever said, “My Son art thou, I have this day begotten thee?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And again, “I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?” and again, when he introduces the first­begotten into the world, he says, “And adore him let all the angels of God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>And of the angels he saith, “Who makes his angels spirits, and his ministers a flame of fire:”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>But of the Son, “Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever; a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of thy kingdom:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Thou hast loved righteousness and hated iniquity; therefore God hath anointed thee, <i>even </i>thy God, with the oil of joy above thy companions:”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p12"></a><b>10 </b>And, “Thou art from the beginning, O Lord, thou hast founded the earth, and the works of thine hands are the heavens;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>They shall perish, but thou continuest; and all as a garment shall become old,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>And as a vesture shalt thou roll them up, and they shall be changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>But to whom of the angels has he ever said, “Sit at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.i-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Are they not all administrative spirits, who are sent forth to minister for those who are to inherit salvation?</p>  <a name="xxi.ii"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.ii-p2"></a>CHAPTER 2</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Wherefore we ought to attend more to those things which we hear, lest at any time we let <i>them flow </i>away.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>For if the word which had been declared by angels, was sure, and every transgression and disobedience received a just recompense of reward;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>How shall we escape, if we neglect so great a salvation? which, having first been begun to be declared by the Lord, has been confirmed to as by those who had heard him;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>While God was at the same time bearing a testimony by signs and wonders and various miracles, and gift distributed by the Holy Spirit, according to his will.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>For to the angels has he not subjected the future world of which we speak:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>But one has in a certain place testified, saying, “What is man, that thou art mindful of him” or the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Thou hast made him a little inferior to the angels; with glory and honor hast thou crowned him, and hast set him over the works of thine hands:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>All things hast thou made subject under his feet.” Doubtless in making subject all things to him, he left nothing that is not made subject: notwithstanding we do not as yet see all things made subject to him;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>But we behold Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels, (crowned with glory and honor for having suffered death,) that he might by the grace of God taste death for all.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For it became him, for whom <i>are </i>all things, and through whom <i>are </i>all things, in leading many sons to glory, to consecrate the leader of their salvation by sufferings:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>For he who sanctifies and they who are sanctified are all of one; for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Saying, “I will declare thy name to my brethren; in the midst of the Church will I sing to thee:” and again, “I will trust in him;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>And again, “Behold I and the children whom God has given me.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Since then the children partake of flesh and blood, he also in like manner was partaker of the same, that by death he might destroy him who had the power of death, that is, the devil;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>And might deliver them who through fear of death were all their life subject to bondage.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>For he nowhere takes hold on angels; but on the seed of Abraham does he take hold.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>It hence behooved him to become in all things like his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest in things respecting God, in order to atone for the sins of the people:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>For as it happened to him to be tried, he is able to succor them who are tried.</p>  <a name="xxi.iii"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.iii-p2"></a>CHAPTER 3</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Therefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling, consider the Apostle and the High Priest of our profession, Christ Jesus:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Who was faithful to him who had appointed him, as Moses also was in his whole house.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>For of greater glory was he counted worthy than Moses, as the builder has greater honor than the house itself</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Every house is indeed built by some one; but he who has built all things is God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And Moses was indeed faithful in his whole house as a minister, for a testimony to those things which were afterwards to be declared;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>But Christ as a Son over his own house; whose house we are, if we hold firm the confidence and the glorying of our hope to the end.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Therefore (as the Holy Spirit saith, “Today, if ye will hear his voice,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of temptation in the wilderness,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works forty years:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>I was therefore offended with that generation, and said, They always err in heart, and they have not known my ways;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>So I swore in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest”)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>See, brethren, that there be not at any time in any of you the wicked heart of unbelief, by departing from the living God:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>But exhort one another daily, while it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deception of sin.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>For we are become partakers of Christ, if indeed we hold firm the beginning of our confidence to the end,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>since it is said, “Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation:”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>For some, when they had heard, did provoke; but not all who had come out of Egypt by Moses.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>With whom then was he offended for forty years? was it not with them who had sinned, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>And to whom did he swear that they should not enter into his rest, except to the unbelieving?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>We then see that they could not enter in on account of unbelief.</p>  <a name="xxi.iv"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.iv-p2"></a>CHAPTER 4</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Let us then fear, lest, when a promise of entering into his rest remains, any of us should seem to be disappointed of it;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p4"></a><b>2 </b>For to us has the promise been announced as well as to them; but the word heard did not profit them, for it was not connected with faith in those who heard <i>it.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p5"></a><b>3 </b>For we enter into his rest when we believe; as he has said, “As I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest;” though the works were done at the creation of the world;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p6"></a><b>4 </b>For he has said thus in a certain place of the seventh day, “And God rested on the seventh day from all his works:”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And here again, “If they shall enter into my rest.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p8"></a><b>6 </b>Seeing then it remains that some do enter into it, but they to whom it was first preached did not enter in on account of unbelief.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Again he defines a certain day, saying by David, “Today,” after so long a time, (as it is said,) “Today, if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p10"></a><b>8 </b>For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken of another after those days.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Then there remains a Sabbath­rest for the people of God;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For he who is entered into his rest, has also himself rested from his own works, as God from his.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Let us then strive to enter into that rest, lest no one fail according to the same example of unbelief.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p14"></a><b>12 </b>For living is the word of God and efficacious, and more penetrating than any two­edged sword, reaching even to the dividing of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and <i>is </i>a discerner of the thoughts and intentions of the heart:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p15"></a><b>13 </b>For there is no creature which does not appear before him; nay, all things are naked and open to the eyes of him with whom we have to do.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Having then a great high priest, who has entered into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our profession:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p17"></a><b>15 </b>For we have not a high priest who cannot sympathize with our infirmities; but <i>was in </i>all things tempted like as we are, yet without sin.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.iv-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Let us then come with confidence to the throne of grace, that we may obtain mercy, and find grace for a seasonable help.</p>  <a name="xxi.v"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.v-p2"></a>CHAPTER 5</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p3"></a><b>1 </b>For every high priest, taken from men, is appointed for men as to things pertaining to God, that he may offer gifts and sacrifices for sins;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Who can render himself gentle to the ignorant and the erring, since he himself is also surrounded with infirmity:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p5"></a><b>3 </b>And on this account he ought, as for the people, so also for himself, to offer for sins.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p6"></a><b>4 </b>And no one takes to himself this honor, but he, who is called by God, as Aaron also <i>was.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p7"></a><b>5 </b><i>So </i>also Christ glorified not himself that he became a high priest, but he who said to him, “My Son art thou, I have this day begotten thee;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p8"></a><b>6 </b>As also he says in another place, “Thou art a priest for ever according to the order of Melchisedec:”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Who in the days of his flesh, when he offered up prayers and supplications, with strong crying and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and was heard in what he feared;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Though he was a Son, yet learned obedience from those things which he suffered;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p11"></a><b>9 </b>And being sanctified, he became to all who obey him the author of eternal salvation;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p12"></a><b>10 </b>Having been called by God a priest according to the order of Melchisedec:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p13"></a><b>11 </b>If whom we have much to say to you, and difficult to be explained, since ye are dull of hearing.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p14"></a><b>12 </b>For when ye ought for the time to be teachers, ye have again need that one should teach you the elements of the beginning of God’s words, and are become such as have need of milk, And not of strong meat:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p15"></a><b>13 </b>For every one who partakes of milk is inexperienced in the word of righteousness, for he is an infant;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.v-p16"></a><b>14 </b>But strong meat is for the perfect, who through practice have their senses exercised so as to distinguish between good and evil.</p>  <a name="xxi.vi"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.vi-p2"></a>CHAPTER 6</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Therefore, passing by the first doctrine of Christ, let us be born onward to perfection, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p4"></a><b>2 </b>(of the doctrine of baptisms and of the imposition of hands,) and of resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p5"></a><b>3 </b>And this we shall do, if God will permit.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p6"></a><b>4 </b>For it is impossible that those who have been once enlightened, and have tasted the heavenly gift, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the world to come,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And have fallen away, should be renewed again into repentance, they having again crucified to themselves the Son of God, and exposed him to open shame.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p9"></a><b>7 </b>For the earth, which drinketh the rain which often cometh upon it, and bringeth forth a blade meet for them by whom it is cultivated, receiveth a blessing from God:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p10"></a><b>8 </b>But that which beareth thorns and briers is worthless and nigh a curse, the end of which is to be burned.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p11"></a><b>9 </b>But we are persuaded, beloved, of better things respecting you, and those connected with salvation, though we thus speak:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For God is not unjust, that he should forget your work, and the labor of that love which yon have shewed towards his name, since ye have ministered to the saints, and do minister.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p13"></a><b>11 </b>But we desire that every one of you should shew the same diligence to the full assurance of hope unto the end;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p14"></a><b>12 </b>So that ye may not become slothful, but be followers of those who by faith and patience have inherited the promises.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p15"></a><b>13 </b>For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he bad none greater by whom he could swear, he swore by himself,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Saying, “Blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I will multiply thee:”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p17"></a><b>15 </b>And so after having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p18"></a><b>16 </b>For men indeed swear by one who is greater, and an oath for confirmation is to them an end of all dispute:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Therefore God, willing more abundantly to shew to the heirs of salvation the immutability of his counsel, interposed an oath;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p20"></a><b>18 </b>That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible that God should lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled to lay hold on the hope set before us:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Which we have as an anchor of the soul, safe and firm, and entering into what is within the veil;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vi-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Where our forerunner, Jesus, has entered, having been made a high priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.</p>  <a name="xxi.vii"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.vii-p2"></a>CHAPTER 7</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>For this Melchisedec, the king of Salem, <i>was a </i>priest of the most high God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings, and blessed him,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>To whom also Abraham divided the tenth of all; who is first indeed, by interpretation, called the King of righteousness, and then also the King of Salem, that is, the King of peace;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Without father, without mother, without kindred, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but being made like to the Son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Now consider how great is he, to whom the patriarch Abraham gave even the tenth of the spoils.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And they indeed who receive the priesthood, even those who are of the sons of Levi, have a command to take the tenth, according to the law from the people, that is, from their brethren, though they have come forth from the loins of Abraham:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>But he whose kindred is not counted from them, took the tenth from Abraham, and blessed him who had the promises:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>And without all controversy, the less is blessed by the greater.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>And here indeed men who die receive the tenth; but there he, of whom it is testified that he liveth;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>And as I may so say, Levi who is wont to receive the tenth, paid the tenth in Abraham;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For he was as yet in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>If then there was perfection by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what need there was still, that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and should not be called after the order of Aaron?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>For when the priesthood is changed, there is also necessarily <i>a </i>change of the law.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Doubtless he of whom these things are said, was from another tribe, from which no one attended at the altar:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>For it is clear that our Lord descended from the tribe of Judah, of which tribe Moses has said nothing as to the priesthood;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>And it is still more clear, since another priest was to rise according to the order of Melchisedec;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Who was not made according to the law of a carnal command, but according to the power of a permanent life;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>For he thus testifies, “Thou art a priest for ever, after the order of Melchisedec.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>For there is an abrogation of the former command, on account of its weakness and uselessness;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>For the law perfected nothing, but <i>was </i>an introduction to a better hope, by which we draw nigh to God;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p22"></a><b>20 </b>And this <i>is</i> better, because it was not done without an oath:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p23"></a><b>21 </b>For they indeed are made priests without an oath; but he with an oath by him who said to him, “Thou art a priest for ever, according to the order of Melchisedec.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p24"></a><b>22 </b>Of so much a better covenant is Jesus made the surety.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p25"></a><b>23 </b>And they indeed being many were made priests, for they were not suffered by death to continue:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p26"></a><b>24 </b>But he, as he remains perpetually, has an unchangeable priesthood.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p27"></a><b>25 </b>Hence he is able also to save for ever those who through him come to God, always living, that he may intercede for them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p28"></a><b>26 </b>For such a high priest became us, being holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners, and higher than the heavens;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p29"></a><b>27 </b>Who has no need, as the priests, daily to offer sacrifices, first for their own sins, and then for <i>the sins </i>of the people; for this he did once when he offered up himself.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.vii-p30"></a><b>28 </b>The law indeed makes men priests who have infirmity; but the word of the oath, which was after the Law, the Son, made perfect for ever.</p>  <a name="xxi.viii"></a>

 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Now of the things which have been said the sum is, — Such an high priest have we, that hath sat down on the right hand of the throne of majesty in the heavens,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>A minister of the sanctuary, even of the true tabernacle, which the Lord has pitched and not man.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices: it is hence necessary that he also should have that which he might offer.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>If indeed he were on earth, he could not be a priest, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Who minister in [that which <i>is</i>] the exemplar and shadow of heavenly things, as Moses was warned by the oracle, when he was about to make the tabernacle, “See,” he says, “that thou make all things according to the pattern which was shewn to thee in the mount.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>But now he has obtained a more excellent ministry, inasmuch as he is the Mediator of a better covenant, which has been established on better promises.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>For if the first had been faultless, there would have been no place sought for the second.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>For finding fault with them, he says, “Behold, the days are coming, saith the Lord, when I shall make with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah a new covenant;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Not according to the covenant I made with their fathers in the day when I laid hold on their hand to lead them up from the land of Egypt; because they have not continued in my covenant and I disregarded them, saith the Lord:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For this is the covenant which I will make with the house of Israel after those days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws in their mind, and in their hearts will I write them; and I will be to them a God, and they shall be to me a people;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>And they shall not teach every one his neighbor, and every one his brother, saying, Know thou the Lord; for all shall know me, from the least among them to the greatest;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.viii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their sins and iniquities will I no more remember.” By calling it new, he hath made old the first; and that which is old and aged is on the eve of vanishing.</p>  <a name="xxi.ix"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.ix-p2"></a>CHAPTER 9</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p3"></a><b>1 </b>The first then had indeed ordinances of worship and a worldly sanctuary:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p4"></a><b>2 </b>For there was made the first tabernacle in which <i>were </i>the candlestick, and the table, and the shew­bread, which is called the sanctuary;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p5"></a><b>3 </b>And after the second vail, the tabernacle which is called the Holy of holies, which has the golden censer, and the ark</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Of the covenant covered around with gold, in which is the golden pot which has manna, and Aaron’s rod which had budded, and the tables of the covenant;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p7"></a><b>5 </b>And over it the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy­seat: of which it is not for us now to speak particularly.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p8"></a><b>6 </b>Now these things being thus set in order, into the first tabernacle the priests always enter who perform the service;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p9"></a><b>7 </b>But into the second, the high priest alone once a year, not without blood, which he offers for the ignorances of himself and of the people;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p10"></a><b>8 </b>The Holy Spirit intimating this, — That the way to the holiest was not yet made manifest while the first tabernacle was yet standing;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Which was a likeness for the time present, in which gifts and sacrifices are offered, which cannot as to conscience sanctify the worshipper,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p12"></a><b>10 </b>Being imposed only with meats and drinks, and divers washings and sanctifications of the flesh, until the time of emendation.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p13"></a><b>11 </b>But Christ, having afterwards come a high priest of good things to come, by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands, that is, not of this creation,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Nor by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood, entered once into the holy place, having obtained eternal redemption.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p15"></a><b>13 </b>For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an heifer sprinkled on the unclean, sanctifies to the purifying of the flesh;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p16"></a><b>14 </b>How much more shall the blood of Christ, who by the eternal Spirit offered himself, <i>being </i>faultless, to God, cleanse your conscience from dead works to serve the living God?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p17"></a><b>15 </b>And for this reason he is the Mediator of a new testament, that by means of death for the redemption of transgressions under the first testament, they who were called might receive the promise of the eternal inheritance</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p18"></a><b>16 </b>For where a testament is, there must necessarily be the death of the testator:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p19"></a><b>17 </b>For a testament is of force as to the dead, for it is never valid as long as the testator is living.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p20"></a><b>18 </b>Hence the first was not dedicated without blood:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p21"></a><b>19 </b>For when every command according to the law had been spoken by Moses to the whole people, taking the blood of calves and of goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he sprinkled the book and all the people,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Saying, “This is the blood of the testament which God hath commanded you.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p23"></a><b>21 </b>And he sprinkled also in a like manner with blood the tabernacle and all the vessels of the ministry;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p24"></a><b>22 </b>And nearly all things are cleansed by blood according to the law: and without shedding of blood there is no remission.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p25"></a><b>23 </b>It is then necessary that the exemplars of those things which are in heaven should be cleansed with these, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p26"></a><b>24 </b>For Christ has not entered into holy places made with hands, the exemplars of the true, but into heaven itself, that he may now appear before God for us;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p27"></a><b>25 </b>Not indeed that he may often offer himself, as the high priest <i>who </i>enters into the holiest every year with another’s blood,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p28"></a><b>26 </b>(for then he must have often suffered since the creation of the world;) but now at the end of the ages hath he once appeared for the destruction of sin by the sacrifice of himself.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p29"></a><b>27 </b>And as it is appointed to men once to die, and after this the judgment;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.ix-p30"></a><b>28 </b>So Christ, having been once offered, that he might take away the sins of many, will appear the second time without sin unto salvation, to those who wait for him.</p>  <a name="xxi.x"></a>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.x-p2"></a>CHAPTER 10</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p3"></a><b>1 </b>For the law, having the shadow of good things to come, not the very living image of things, can never by the sacrifices which are offered continually every year, sanctify those who come;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Would they not have otherwise ceased to be offered? because the worshippers, once cleansed, would have no more conscience of sins</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p5"></a><b>3 </b>But in these there is a remembrance of sins every year;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p6"></a><b>4 </b>For it is impossible that the blood of bulls and goats should take away sins.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p7"></a><b>5 </b>Therefore when coming into the world, he saith, “Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared for me;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p8"></a><b>6 </b>Burnt­offerings and <i>sacrifices </i>for sin thou hast not approved;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Then said I, Lo, I am coming (in the volume of the book it is written of me) that I may do, O God, thy will.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p10"></a><b>8 </b>After having said above, “Sacrifice and offering, burnt­offering and <i>sacrifices </i>for sin thou wouldest not, nor hast thou approved,” which are offered according to the law;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Then he said, “Lo, I am coming that I may do, O God, thy will,” —he takes away the first, that he may establish the second;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p12"></a><b>10 </b>By which will we are sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once <i>made.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p13"></a><b>11 </b>And every priest stands, indeed, daily to minister and to offer often the same sacrifices which can never take away sins;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p14"></a><b>12 </b>But he, having offered one sacrifice for sins, sits down perpetually at the right hand of God,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Henceforth waiting until his enemies be made his footstool:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p16"></a><b>14 </b>For by one offering he hath consecrated for ever those who are sanctified.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p17"></a><b>15.</b> Now the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after having previously said,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p18"></a><b>16 </b>“This is the covenant which I will make with them after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws in their hearts, and in their minds will I write them,” [he adds,]</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p19"></a><b>17 </b>“And their sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p20"></a><b>18 </b>Now, where there is remission of these, there is no more offering for sin.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Having then, brethren, confidence to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p22"></a><b>20 </b>By a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is, his flesh,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p23"></a><b>21 </b>And having a great priest over the house of God,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p24"></a><b>22 </b>Let us draw near with a sincere heart, in a full assurance of faith, sprinkled in our hearts from an evil conscience, and washed in our body with pure water;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p25"></a><b>23 </b>Let us hold the confession of our hope with out wavering, for faithful is he who has promised;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p26"></a><b>24 </b>And let us consider one another for the purpose of emulation in love and in good works;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p27"></a><b>25 </b>Nor let us neglect the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is; but let us exhort <i>one </i>another, and so much the more as ye see the day approaching.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p28"></a><b>26 </b>For to those who willingly sin, after having received the knowledge of the truth, there is no more left a sacrifice for sins,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p29"></a><b>27 </b>But a dreadful expectation of judgment, and a fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p30"></a><b>28 </b>He who cast aside the law of Moses died without mercy under two or three witnesses: of how much heavier punishment,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p31"></a><b>29 </b>Think ye, shall he be deemed worthy, who has trodden under foot the Son of God, and counted unholy the blood of the testament by which he has been sanctified, and has treated scornfully the Spirit of grace?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p32"></a><b>30 </b>For we know who says, “Mine is vengeance, I will repay,” saith the Lord; and again, “The Lord will judge his people.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p33"></a><b>31 </b>It is a dreadful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p34"></a><b>32 </b>But remember the former days, in which, after being illuminated, ye endured a great conflict of sufferings; partly when ye were exposed to public shame by reproaches and distresses,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p35"></a><b>33 </b>And partly when ye became the companions of those who were thus treated:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p36"></a><b>34 </b>For ye sympathized with me in my bonds, and took the plunder of your goods with joy, knowing that ye have a better and an enduring substance in heaven.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p37"></a><b>35 </b>Cast not then away your confidence which has a great recompense of reward.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p38"></a><b>36 </b>Ye have truly need of patience, so that having done the will of God, ye may obtain the promise:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p39"></a><b>37 </b>For it will yet be a little while, when he who is coming will come, and will not delay.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p40"></a><b>38 </b>But the just, by faith shall he live; and if he draws back, my soul shall have no delight in him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.x-p41"></a><b>39 </b>But we are not of those who draw back to perdition, but of those who believe to the salvation of the soul.</p>  <a name="xxi.xi"></a>

 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the demonstration of things not seen:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p4"></a><b>2 </b>For by it the elders obtained a testimony.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p5"></a><b>3 </b>By faith we understand that the worlds were set in order by the Word of God, so that of things not visible they became visible.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p6"></a><b>4 </b>By faith Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, by which he obtained a testimony that he was righteous, God bearing a testimony to his gifts; and by it, he being dead, yet speaketh.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p7"></a><b>5 </b>By faith Enoch was translated, so as not to see death; nor was he found, because God had translated him; for before his translation he had received a testimony that he pleased God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p8"></a><b>6 </b>But without faith it is impossible to please him; for he who comes to God must believe that he is, and that he is the rewarder of those who seek him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p9"></a><b>7 </b>By faith Noah, having been warned by God of things which did not as yet appear, being moved with fear, prepared an ark for the preservation of his house; by which he condemned the world, and became heir of the righteousness which is by faith.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p10"></a><b>8 </b>By faith Abraham, when he was called, obeyed, so that he went out into the place which he was to receive for an inheritance; and he went out, not knowing where he was going.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p11"></a><b>9 </b>By faith he sojourned in the promised land, as though it was a foreign country, dwelling in tents together with Isaac and Jacob, co­heirs to the same promise;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p12"></a><b>10 </b>For he expected a city having foundations, whose master­builder and maker is God.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p13"></a><b>11 </b>By faith also Sarah herself received power to conceive seed; and beyond the time of age she brought forth, because she counted him faithful who had promised.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Therefore there have been begotten even of one, and him indeed dead, <i>those </i>in multitude as the stars of heaven, and as the numberless sand which is on the sea­shore.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p15"></a><b>13 </b>All these died in faith, not having received the promises, but having afar off seen, and believed, and embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth:</p>

 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p18"></a><b>16 </b>But they now desire a better, even that which is heavenly: hence God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p19"></a><b>17 </b>By faith Abraham offered up Isaac, when he was tried; and he offered up the only­begotten after having received the promises,</p>

 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p24"></a><b>22 </b>By faith Joseph, when dying, made mention of the departure of the children of Israel, and gave an order respecting his bones.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xi-p25"></a><b>23 </b>By faith Moses, when born, was hid three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a beautiful child, and feared not the decree of the king.</p>

 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Raise ye up, therefore, the remiss hands, and the relaxed knees,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>And make straight paths for your feet, that halting may not lead you astray, but rather that it may be healed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Follow peace with all, and holiness, without which no one shall see the Lord;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Taking heed, lest any one should come short of the grace of God; lest any root of bitterness, growing up, should disturb you, and many be through it defiled;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>Lest there should be any fornicator or a profane person, like Esau, who for one meal sold his birthright:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>For ye know that when afterwards he wished to inherit the blessing, he was rejected; for he found no place for repentance, though he sought it with tears.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>For we have not come to the mount that might be touched, and to the burning fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>And to the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words, which they having heard entreated that the word should not be proclaimed to them;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p22"></a><b>20 </b>For they could not bear what was enjoined, “If a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned or pierced through with a dart;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p23"></a><b>21 </b>And so terrible was the sight, <i>that </i>Moses said, “I fear and tremble.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p24"></a><b>22 </b>But ye have come to Mount Sion, the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to the company of innumerable angels,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p25"></a><b>23 </b>And to the Church of the first­born, who are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirits of just men made perfect,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p26"></a><b>24 </b>And to Jesus the Mediator of the New Testament, and the blood of sprinkling, which speaks better things than that of Abel.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p27"></a><b>25 </b>See that ye despise not him that speaketh; for if they escaped not who despised him who spoke on earth, how much less we, if we turn away from him <i>who speaks </i>from heaven?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p28"></a><b>26 </b>Whose voice then shook the earth; but now he has promised, saying, “Yet once I shake, not only the earth, but also heaven:”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p29"></a><b>27 </b>And this, “Set once,” signifies the removal of the things shaken, that the things unshaken might remain.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p30"></a><b>28 </b>Hence we, who receive a kingdom which is not shaken, have grace, by which we serve God acceptably with reverence and fear:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xii-p31"></a><b>29 </b>“For our God is a consuming fire.”</p>  <a name="xxi.xiii"></a>

 </p><p class="HDG-C-Gr-16-Pref18"><a name="xxi.xiii-p2"></a>CHAPTER 13</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Let brotherly love continue.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Be not unmindful of hospitality; for by this some have unawares received angels.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Remember those in bonds, as bound with them, <i>and </i>the afflicted, as ye yourselves are in the body.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p6"></a><b>4 </b>Honorable is marriage in all, and the unpolluted bed; but fornicators and adulterers God will condemn.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p7"></a><b>5 </b><i>Let your </i>conduct <i>be </i>without avarice; be content with what ye have; for he has said, “I will not leave thee, nor forsake thee;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>So that we may confidently say, “The Lord is to me a helper, nor will I fear what man may do to me.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Remember those who are set over you, who have spoken to you the Word of God; whose faith follow, considering the end of their conduct.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Jesus Christ, yesterday and today, is even the same for ever;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Be not carried about by various and foreign doctrines; for it is good that the heart should be strengthened by grace, not by meats, which have not profited those who have been conversant in them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>We have an altar, from which they have no right to eat who serve the tabernacle.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>For the beasts, whose blood for sin is brought by the high priest into the holiest, their bodies are burnt without the camp.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>Hence Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people by his own blood, suffered without the camp.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>Let us then go forth to him without the gate, bearing his reproach.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>For we have not here an abiding city, but we seek one to come.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>By him, then, let us continually offer the sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of our lips, giving thanks to his name:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>But to do good, and to communicate, forget not; for with such sacrifices God is well pleased.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Obey those who are set over you, and be submissive; for they watch for your souls, as those who are to render an account; so that they may do this with joy, and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable to you.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>Pray for us; for we trust that we have a good conscience, desiring in all things to live honestly:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>But I beseech you the more to do this, that I may the sooner be restored to you.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Now may the God of peace, who brought up from the dead the great pastor of the sheep in the blood of the eternal covenant,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p23"></a><b>21 </b>Even our Lord Jesus, confirm you in every good work, that ye may do his will, doing in you what is acceptable before him through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p24"></a><b>22 </b>But I beseech you, brethren, bear the word of exhortation; for a few words have I written to you.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p25"></a><b>23 </b>Know ye that brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom, if he comes shortly, I shall see you.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p26"></a><b>24 </b>Salute all those who are set over you, and all the saints; they from Italy salute you.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xxi.xiii-p27"></a><b>25 </b>Grace be with you all. Amen.</p>
