 <p><a name="xvi.i-p2"></a><b>1. </b>Verily, verily, I say to you, He who entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth by another way, is a thief and a robber. <b>2.</b> But he who entereth by the door is the shepherd of the sheep. <b>3. </b>To him the porter openeth, and the sheep hear his voice, and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out. <b>4.</b> And having put out his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him; for they know 				  his voice. <b>5.</b> But they will not follow a stranger, but will flee from him; for they know not the voice of strangers. <b>6.</b> Jesus spoke this parable to them; but they did not understand what those things were which he spoke to them.</p>

 <p><a name="xvi.i-p5"></a><b>1.</b> <i>Verily, verily, I say to you.</i> As Christ had to do with scribes and priests, who were reckoned pastors of the Church, it was necessary that they should be divested of the honor of this title, if he wished his doctrine to be received. The small number of believers 			 might also diminish greatly the authority of his doctrine. He therefore contends that we ought not to reckon, in the number of <i>shepherds </i>or of <i>sheep</i>, all who outwardly claim a place in the Church. But we shall never be able, by means of this mark, to distinguish the lawful <i>shepherds</i> from the reprobate, and the true <i>sheep </i>from the counterfeit, if all have the same object, and beginning, and end.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p6"></a>This warning has been highly useful in all ages, and in the present day it is especially necessary. No plague is more destructive to the Church, than when wolves ravage under the garb of <i>shepherds</i>  We know also how grievous an offense it is, when bastard or degenerate Israelites pretend to 			 be the sons of the Church, and, on this pretense, insult believers. But in the present day, there is nothing by which weak and ignorant persons are more alarmed, than when they see the sanctuary of God occupied by the greatest enemies of the Church; for it is not easy to make them understand, that it is the doctrine of Christ which the <i>shepherds</i> of the Church so fiercely resist. 			 Besides, as the greater part of men are led into various errors by false doctrines, while the views and expectations of each person are directed to others, scarcely any person permits himself to be conducted into the right path.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p7"></a>We must therefore, above all things, guard against being deceived by pretended <i>shepherds</i> or counterfeit <i>sheep</i>, if we do not choose, of our own accord, to expose ourselves to 			 <i>wolves </i>and <i>thieves</i>  The name of “The Church” is highly honorable, and justly so; but the greater the reverence which it deserves, so much the more careful and attentive ought we to be in marking the distinction between true and false doctrine. Christ here declares openly, that we ought not to reckon as <i>shepherds</i> all who boast of being such, and that we ought not to reckon as sheep all who boast of outward marks. He speaks of the Jewish Church, but what he says applies equally well to our own. We ought also to consider his purpose and design, that weak consciences may not be alarmed or discouraged, when they perceive that they who rule in the Church, instead of<i> pastors 			 </i>or <i>shepherds</i>, are hostile or opposed to the Gospel; and that they may not turn aside from the faith, because they have few fellow-disciples, in listening to Christ, among those who are called Christians.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p8"></a><i>He who entereth not by the door.</i> It is useless, I think, to scrutinize too closely every part of this parable. Let us rest satisfied with this general view, that, as Christ states a resemblance between the Church and a <i>sheepfold</i>, in which God assembles all his people, so he compares himself to a <i>door</i>, because there is no other entrance into the Church but by himself. Hence it follows that they alone are good <i>shepherds</i> who lead men 			 straight to Christ; and that they are truly gathered into the <i>fold </i>of Christ, so as to belong to his flock, who devote themselves to Christ alone.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p9"></a>But all this relates to doctrine; for, since</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xvi.i-p10"></a>all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Christ, <br> 			 (<a name="xvi.i-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#003">Col 2:3</a><a name="xvi.i-p10.2"></a>,)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p11"></a>he who turns aside from him to go elsewhere neither keeps the road nor <i>enters by the door.</i> Now, whoever shall not despise Christ or his instructor will easily rid himself of that hesitation which keeps so many in a state of perplexity, what is the Church, and who are they to whom we ought to listen as 			 <i>shepherds</i>  For if they who are called shepherds attempt to lead us away from Christ, we ought to flee from them, at the command of Christ, as we would flee from <i>wolves </i>or <i>thieves</i>; and we ought not to form or 			 maintain intercourse with any society but that which is agreed in the pure faith of the Gospel. For this reason Christ exhorts his disciples to separate themselves from the unbelieving multitude of the whole nation, not to suffer themselves to be governed by wicked priests, and not to allow themselves to be imposed upon by proud and empty names.</p>

  			  any one choose to understand God, I do not object; and Christ even appears expressly to contrast the judgment of God with the false opinion of men in approving of pastors, as if he had said, “There are others, indeed, whom the world generally applauds, and on whom it willingly confers honor; but God, who holds the reins of government, does not acknowledge or approve of any but those who lead <i>the sheep </i>by this road.”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p15"></a><i>He calleth his own sheep by name.</i> I consider this as referring to the mutual consent of faith; because the disciple and the teacher are united together by the one Spirit of God, so that the teacher goes before, and the disciple follows. Some think that it denotes the intimate knowledge which every <i>shepherd </i>ought to have of each of his flock, but I do not know if this rests on solid grounds.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.i-p16"></a><a name="xvi.i-p16.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p17"></a><b>4.</b><i> Because they know his voice.</i> Though he speaks here of ministers, yet, instead of wishing that they should be <i>heard</i>, he wishes that God should be <i>heard </i>speaking 			 by them; for we must attend to the distinction which he has laid down, that he alone is a faithful <i>pastor </i>or <i>shepherd</i>   			  <a name="fr_282"></a><a href="#fn_282"><font size="1">283</font></a>
  			  of the Church, who conducts and governs his sheep by the direction of Christ. We must attend to the reason why it is said that <i>the sheep follow</i>; it is, because <i>they know</i> how to distinguish 			 <i>shepherds</i> from wolves by <i>the voice</i>  This is the spirit of discernment, by which the elect discriminate between the truth of God and the false inventions of men. So then, in <i>the 			 sheep</i> of Christ a knowledge of the truth goes before, and next follows an earnest desire to obey, so that they not only understand what is true, but receive it with warm affection. And not only does he commend the obedience of the faith, because the sheep assemble submissively at <i>the voice</i> of the shepherd, but also 			 because they do not listen to the voice of <i>strangers,</i> and do not disperse when any one cries to them.</p>

 <p><a name="xvi.i-p20"></a><b>6.</b> <i>This parable.</i> This is the reason why, proudly vaunting of their wisdom, they rejected the light of Christ; for in a matter not very obscure they are exceedingly dull of apprehension.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.i-p21"></a><i>But they did not understand what things they were which he spoke to them.</i> In this clause the Greek manuscripts differ. Some copies might be literally rendered, <i>they did not understand what he said</i>  Another reading, which I have followed, is more full, though it amounts to the same meaning. The third reading is, that <i>they did not know that he who spoke of himself was the Son of God</i>; but this is not much approved.</p>  <a name="xvi.ii"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption20"><a name="xvi.ii-p1"></a><a name="xvi.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#007">John 10:7-10</a><a name="xvi.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p2"></a><b>7. </b>And Jesus again said to them, Verily, verily, I say to you, that I am the door of the sheep. <b>8.</b> All who have entered before me are thieves and robbers; but the sheep did not hear them. <b>9.</b> I am the door. If any man enter by me, he shall be saved, and shall go in and out, and find pasture. <b>10.</b> The thief cometh not but to steal, and to kill, and to destroy; I am come, that they may have life, and that they may have it 				  more abundantly.</p>

 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p5"></a><b>7.</b> <i>I am the door.</i> If this explanation had not been added, the whole discourse would have been allegorical. He now explains more clearly what was the chief part of the parable when he declares that <i>he is the door</i>  The amount of what is stated is, that the principal point of all spiritual doctrine, on which souls are fed, consists in Christ. Hence also Paul, one of the shepherds, says:</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xvi.ii-p6"></a>I reckon nothing to be worth knowing but Jesus Christ,<br> 			 (<a name="xvi.ii-p6.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#002">1Co 2:2</a><a name="xvi.ii-p6.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p7"></a>And this mode of expression conveys the same meaning as if Christ had testified that to him alone we must all be gathered together. Therefore, he invokes and exhorts all who desire salvation to come to him. By these words, he means that in vain do they wander about who leave him to go to God, because there is but one open <i>door</i>, and all approach in any other way is prohibited.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.ii-p8"></a><a name="xvi.ii-p8.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p9"></a><b>8.</b> <i>All who came before me.</i> The words <a name="xvi.ii-p9.1"></a>πάντες ὅσοι may be literally rendered, all as many as <i>came before me</i>  They who restrict this expression to Judas the Galilean, and such persons, depart widely, in my opinion, from Christ’s meaning; for he contrasts all false doctrine, in general, with the Gospel, and all false prophets with faithful teachers. Nor would it even be unreasonable to extend this statement to 			 the Gentiles, that all who, from the beginning of the world, have professed to be teachers, and have not labored to gather <i>sheep</i> to Christ, have abused this title for destroying souls. But this does not at all apply to Moses and the Prophets, who had no other object in view than to establish the kingdom of Christ. For it ought to be observed, that a contrast is here made between 			 the words of Christ and those things which are opposed to them. But so far are we from discovering any contradiction between the Law and the doctrine of the Gospel, that the Law is nothing else than a preparation for the Gospel. In short, Christ testifies that all the doctrines, by which the world has been led away from him, are so many deadly plagues; because, apart from him, there is nothing but destruction and horrible confusion. Meanwhile, we see of what importance antiquity is with God, 			 and in what estimation it ought to be held by us, when it enters, as it were, into a contest with Christ. That no man may be moved by the consideration, that there have been teachers, in all ages, who gave themselves no concern whatever about directing men to Christ, Christ expressly states that it is of no consequence how many there have been of this description, or how early they began to appear; for it ought to be considered that there is but <i>one door</i>, and that they who leave it, and make openings or breaches in the walls, are <i>thieves</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p10"></a><i>But the sheep did not hear them.</i> He now confirms more clearly what he had already spoken more obscurely and in the figure of an allegory, that they who were led out of the way by impostors did not belong to the Church of God. This is said, first, that when we see a great multitude of persons going astray, we may not resolve to perish 			 through their example; and, next, that we may not waver, when God permits impostors to deceive many. For it is no light consolation, and no small ground of confidence, when we know that Christ, by his faithful protection, has always guarded his <i>sheep,</i> amidst the various attacks and crafty devices of wolves and robbers, so that there never was one of them that deserted 			 him.   			  <a name="fr_283"></a><a href="#fn_283"><font size="1">284</font></a>
 </p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p12"></a>But here a question arises, When does a person begin to belong to the flock of the Son of God?   			  <a name="fr_284"></a><a href="#fn_284"><font size="1">285</font></a>
  			  For we see many who stray and wander through deserts during the greater part of their life, and are at length brought into the fold of Christ. I reply, the word <i>sheep </i>is here used in two ways. When Christ says afterwards, that he has <i>other sheep </i>besides, he includes all the elect of God, who had at that time no resemblance to 			 <i>sheep</i>  At present, he means <i>sheep</i> which bore the shepherd’s mark. By nature, we are at the greatest possible distance from being <i>sheep</i>; but, 			 on the contrary, are born lions, tigers, wolves, and bears,   			  <a name="fr_285"></a><a href="#fn_285"><font size="1">286</font></a>
  			  until the Spirit of Christ tames us, and from wild and savage beasts forms us to be mild <i>sheep</i>  Thus, according to the secret election of God, we are already <i>sheep</i> in his heart, before we are born; but we begin to 			 be <i>sheep</i> in ourselves by the calling, by which he gathers us into his fold. Christ declares that they who are called into the order of believers are so firmly bound together, that they cannot stray or wander, or be carried about by any wind of new doctrine.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p15"></a>It will perhaps be objected, that even those who had been devoted to Christ frequently go astray, and that this is proved by frequent experience, and that it is not without good reason that Ezekiel ascribes it to the good Shepherd, that he gathers <i>the scattered sheep</i>, (<a name="xvi.ii-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze034.htm#012">Eze 34:12</a><a name="xvi.ii-p15.1"></a>.) I readily acknowledge that it frequently happens, that they who had belonged to the household of faith are, for a time, estranged; but this is not at variance with Christ’s statement, for, so far as they go astray, they cease, in some respects, to be <i>sheep</i>  What 			 Christ means is simply this, that all the elect of God, though they were tempted to go astray in innumerable ways, were kept in obedience to the pure faith, so that they were not exposed as a prey to Satan, or to his ministers. But this work of God is not less astonishing, when he again gathers<i> the sheep</i> which had wandered for a little, than if they had all along continued to be 			 shut up in the fold. It is always true, and without a single exception, that</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xvi.ii-p16"></a>they who go out from us were not of us, <br> 			 but that they who were of us remain with us to the end, <br> 			 (<a name="xvi.ii-p16.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019">1Jo 2:19</a><a name="xvi.ii-p16.3"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p17"></a>This passage ought to strike us with the deepest shame; first, because we are so ill accustomed to <i>the voice </i>of our <i>Shepherd</i>, that there are hardly any who do not listen to it with indifference; and, next, because we are so slow and indolent to follow him. I speak of the good, 			 or of those who are at least passable; for the greater part of those who boast that they are Christ’s disciples kick fiercely against him. Lastly, as soon as the voice of any <i>stranger </i>has sounded in our ears, we are hurried to and fro; and this lightness and unsteadiness sufficiently shows how little progress we have hitherto made in the faith. But if the number of believers is smaller than might be desired, and if out of this small number a 			 large proportion be continually dropping off, faithful teachers have this consolation to support them, that the elect of God, who are Christ’s <i>sheep,</i> listen to them. It is our duty, indeed, to labor diligently, and to strive by every possible method, that the whole world may be brought, if possible, into the unity of the faith; but let us, in the meantime, be well satisfied with 			 belonging to the number.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.ii-p18"></a><a name="xvi.ii-p18.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p19"></a><b>9.</b> <i>If any man enter by me.</i> The highest consolation of believers is, that when they have once embraced Christ, they learn that they are out of danger; for Christ promises to them salvation and happiness. He afterwards divides it into two parts.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p20"></a><i>He shall go in and out, and find pasture.</i> First, they shall go safely wherever they find necessary; and, next, they shall be fed to the full. By <i>going in and out</i>, Scripture often denotes all the actions of the life, as we say in French, 			 <i>aller et venir</i>, (<i>to go and come</i>,)   			  <a name="fr_286"></a><a href="#fn_286"><font size="1">287</font></a>
  			  which means, <i>to dwell</i>  These words, therefore, present to us a twofold advantage of the Gospel, that our souls shall find pasture in it, which otherwise become faint and famished, and are fed with nothing but wind; and, next, because he will faithfully protect and guard us against the attacks of wolves and robbers.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.ii-p22"></a><a name="xvi.ii-p22.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p23"></a><b>10.</b> <i>The thief cometh not.</i> By this saying, Christ — if we may use the expression — pulls our ear, that the ministers of Satan may not come upon us by surprise, when we are in a drowsy and careless state; for our excessive indifference exposes us, on every side, to false doctrines. For 			 whence arises credulity so great, that they who ought to have remained fixed in Christ, fly about in a multitude of errors, but because they do not sufficiently dread or guard against so many false teachers? And not only so, but our insatiable curiosity is so delighted with the new and strange inventions of men, that, of our own accord, we rush with mad career to meet thieves and wolves. Not without reason, therefore, does Christ testify that false teachers, whatever may be the mildness and 			 plausibility of their demeanour, always carry about a deadly poison, that we may be more careful to drive them away from us. A similar warning is given by Paul,</p>  		  
 <p class="Center"><a name="xvi.ii-p24"></a>See that no man rob you through vain philosophy, <br> 			 (<a name="xvi.ii-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#008">Col 2:8</a><a name="xvi.ii-p24.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p25"></a><i>I am come.</i> This is a different comparison; for Christ, having hitherto called himself <i>the door,</i> and declared that they who bring sheep to this <i>door </i>are true <i>shepherds</i>, now assumes the character of a shepherd, and indeed affirms that he is the only <i>shepherd</i>  Indeed, there is no other to whom this honor and title strictly belongs; for, as to all the faithful <i>shepherds </i>of the Church, it is he who raises them up, endows 			 them with the necessary qualifications, governs them by his Spirit, and works by them; and therefore they do not prevent him from being the only Governor of his Church, or from holding the distinction of being the only <i>Shepherd</i>  For, though he employs their ministry, still he does not cease to fulfill and discharge the office of a <i>shepherd </i>by his 			 own power; and they are masters and teachers in such a manner as not to interfere with his authority as a Master. In short, when the term <i>shepherd </i>is applied to men, it is used, as we say, in a subordinate sense; and Christ shares the honor with his ministers in such a manner, that he still continues to be the only <i>shepherd </i>both of themselves and of the whole flock.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.ii-p26"></a><i>That they may have life.</i> When he says that <i>he is come</i>,<i> that the sheep may have life</i>, he means that they only who do not submit to his <i>staff and crook </i>(<a name="xvi.ii-p26.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004">Ps 23:4</a><a name="xvi.ii-p26.1"></a>) are exposed to the ravages of wolves and thieves; and — to give them greater confidence — he declares that <i>life </i>is continually increased and strengthened in 			 those who do not revolt from him. And, indeed, the greater progress that any man makes in faith, the more nearly does he approach to fullness of<i> life,</i> because the Spirit, who is life, grows in him.</p>  <a name="xvi.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p5"></a><b>11.</b> <i>The good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</i> From the extraordinary affection which he bears towards the <i>sheep,</i> he shows how truly he acts towards them as a 			 <i>shepherd;</i> for he is so anxious about their salvation, that he does not even spare his own life. Hence it follows, that they who reject the guardianship of so kind and amiable a <i>shepherd </i>are exceedingly ungrateful, and deserve a hundred deaths, and are exposed to every kind of harm. The remark of Augustine is exceedingly just, that 			 this passage informs us what we ought to desire, what we ought to avoid, and what we ought to endure, in the government of the Church. Nothing is more desirable than that the Church should be governed by good and diligent <i>shepherds</i>  Christ declares that <i>he is the good shepherd</i>,<i> 			 </i>who keeps his Church safe and sound, first, by himself, and, next, by his agents. Whenever there is good order, and fit men hold the government, then Christ shows that he is actually <i>the shepherd</i>  But there are many wolves and thieves who, wearing the garb of <i>shepherds</i>, wickedly scatter the Church. Whatever name such persons may assume, Christ threatens that we must avoid them.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xvi.iii-p6"></a><a name="xvi.iii-p6.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p7"></a><b>12.</b> <i>But the hireling.</i> By <i>hirelings </i>we are to understand those who retain the pure doctrine, and who proclaim the truth, as Paul says, to serve a purpose rather than from pure zeal. Though such persons do not serve Christ faithfully, yet 			 we ought to hear them; for Christ wished that <i>the Pharisees </i>should be heard, <i>because they sat in Moses</i>’<i> seat</i>, (<a name="xvi.iii-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#002">Mt 23:2</a><a name="xvi.iii-p7.1"></a>;) and, in like manner, we ought to give such honor to the Gospel, 			 as not to shrink from its ministers, though they be not good men. And as even the slightest offenses render the Gospel distasteful to us, that we may not be hindered by such false delicacy, let us always remember what I have formerly suggested, that if the Spirit of Christ does not operate so powerfully in ministers, as to make it plainly evident that he is their <i>shepherd</i>, we suffer the 			 punishment of our sins, and yet our obedience is proved.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p8"></a><i>And he who is not the shepherd.</i> Though Christ claims for himself alone the name of a <i>shepherd, </i>yet he indirectly states that, in some respects, he holds it in common with the agents by whom he acts. For we know that there have been many, since the time of Christ, who did not hesitate to 			 shed their blood for the salvation of the Church; and even the prophets, before his coming, did not spare their own life. But in his own person he holds out a perfect example, so as to lay down a rule for his ministers. For how base and shameful is our indolence, if our life is more dear to us than the salvation of the Church, which Christ preferred to his own life!</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p9"></a>What is here said about <i>laying down life for the sheep</i>, may be viewed as an undoubted and principal mark of paternal affection. Christ intended, first, to demonstrate what a remarkable proof he gave of his love toward us, and, next, to excite all his ministers to imitate his example. 			 Yet we must attend to the difference between them and him. He <i>laid down his life</i> as the price of satisfaction, shed his blood to cleanse our souls, offered his body as a propitiatory sacrifice, to reconcile the Father to us. Nothing of all this can exist in the ministers of the Gospel, all of whom need to be cleansed, and receive atonement and reconciliation to God by that single 			 sacrifice. But Christ does not argue here about the efficacy or benefit of his death, so as to compare himself to others, but to prove with what zeal and affection   			  <a name="fr_287"></a><a href="#fn_287"><font size="1">288</font></a>
  			  he is moved towards us, and, next, to invite others to follow his example. In short, as it belongs exclusively to Christ to procure life for us by his death, and to fulfill all that is contained in the Gospel, so it is the universal duty of all <i>pastors </i>or <i>shepherds</i>, to defend the doctrine which they proclaim, even at 			 the expense of their life, and to seal the doctrine of the Gospel with their blood, and to show that it is not in vain that they teach that Christ has procured salvation for themselves and for others.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p11"></a>But here a question may be put. Ought we to reckon that man <i>a hireling,</i> who, for any reason whatever, shrinks from encountering the wolves? This was anciently debated as a practical question, when tyrants raged cruelly against the Church. Tertullian, and others of the same class, were, in my opinion, too 			 rigid on this point. I prefer greatly the moderation of Augustine, who allows pastors to flee on the condition that, by their flight, they contribute more to the public safety than they would do by betraying the flock committed to their charge. And he shows that this is done, when the Church is not deprived of well-qualified ministers, and when the life of the pastor in particular is so eagerly sought, that his absence mitigates the rage of enemies. But it the flock — as well as the pastor — be 			 in danger,   			  <a name="fr_288"></a><a href="#fn_288"><font size="1">289</font></a>
  			  and if there be reason to believe that the pastor flees, not so much from a desire to promote the public advantage as from a dread of dying, Augustine contends that this is not at all lawful, because the example of his flight will do more injury than his life can do good in future. The reader may consult the Epistle to Bishop Honoratus, (<a name="xvi.iii-p12.2"></a>Ep. 108<a name="xvi.iii-p12.2"></a>) On this ground it was lawful for Cyprian to flee, who was so far from shuddering at death, that he nobly refused to 			 accept the offer of saving his life by a treacherous denial of his Master. Only it must be held that a pastor ought to prefer his flock, or even a single sheep, to his own life.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iii-p13"></a><i>Whose own the sheep are not.</i> Christ appears here to make all <i>shepherds </i>besides himself to be, without exception,<i> hirelings</i>; for, since he alone is <i>shepherd</i>, none of us have a right to say that the sheep which he feeds are <i>his own</i>  But let us remember that they who are guided by the Spirit of God reckon that to be <i>their own </i>which belongs to their Head; and that not in order to claim power for themselves, 			 but to keep faithfully what has been committed to their charge. For he who is truly united to Christ will never cease to take an interest in that which He valued so highly. This is what he afterwards says:</p>

At the same time, he demands the duty which we mutually owe to him, because, as he employs all the power which he has received from the Father for our protection, so he wishes that we should be obedient and devoted to him, as he is wholly devoted to his Father, and refers everything to him.</p>  <a name="xvi.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="xvi.iv-p5"></a><b>16.</b><i> And I have other sheep.</i> Though some refer this indiscriminately to all, both Jews and Gentiles, who were not yet disciples of Christ, yet I have no doubt that he had in his eye the calling of the Gentiles. For he gives the appellation <i>fold</i> to the assemblage of the ancient people, by which they were separated from the other nations of the world, and united into one body as the heritage of God. The Jews had been adopted by God in such a manner, that he surrounded them with certain enclosures, which consisted of rites and ceremonies, that they might not be confounded with unbelievers, though the door of the<i> fold </i>was the gracious covenant of eternal life confirmed in Christ. For this reason he calls those <i>sheep </i>which had not the same mark, but belonged to a different class, <i>other sheep</i>  In short, the meaning is, that the pastoral office of Christ is not confined within the 			 limits of Judea, but is far more extensive.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iv-p6"></a>Augustine’s observation on this passage is undoubtedly true, that, as there are many wolves <i>within </i>the Church, so there are many sheep <i>without</i>  But this is not applicable, in every respect, to the present passage, which relates to the outward aspect of the Church, because the 			 Gentiles, who had been strangers for a time, were afterwards invited into the kingdom of God, along with the Jews. Yet I acknowledge that Augustine’s statement applies in this respect, that Christ gives the name of <i>sheep</i> to unbelievers, who in themselves were the farthest possible from being entitled to be called <i>sheep</i>  And not only does he point out, by this term, what they will be, but rather refers this to the secret election of God, because we are already God’s <i>sheep</i>, before we are aware that He is our shepherd. In like manner, it is elsewhere said that <i>we were 			 enemies</i>,<i> when he loved us</i>, (<a name="xvi.iv-p6.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Ro 5:10</a><a name="xvi.iv-p6.1"></a>;) and for this reason Paul also says that <i>we were known by God</i>,<i> before we knew him</i>, (<a name="xvi.iv-p6.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009">Ga 4:9</a><a name="xvi.iv-p6.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iv-p7"></a><i>Them also I must bring.</i> He means that the election of God will be secure, so that nothing of all that he wishes to be saved shall perish.   			  <a name="fr_289"></a><a href="#fn_289"><font size="1">290</font></a>
  			  For the secret purpose of God, by which men were ordained to life, is at length manifested in his own time by the calling, — the effectual calling, when he regenerates by his Spirit, to be his sons, those who formerly were begotten of flesh and blood.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.iv-p9"></a>But it may be asked, How were the Gentiles brought to be associated with the Jews? For the Jews were not under the necessity of rejecting the covenant which God made with their fathers, in order to become Christ’s disciples; and the Gentiles, on the other hand, were not under the necessity of submitting to the yoke of the Law, that, being ingrafted in Christ, they might be associated with the Jews. Here we must attend to the distinction 			 between the substance of the covenant and the outward appendages. For the Gentiles could not assent to the faith of Christ in any other way than by embracing that everlasting covenant on which the salvation of the world was founded. In this manner were fulfilled the predictions,</p>

  			  then only is it in a state of good order. If Papists can show us that there is any thing of this sort among them, let them enjoy the title of The Church, of which they vaunt so much. But if Christ is silent there, if his majesty is trodden under foot, if his sacred ordinances are held up to scorn, what else is their unity but a diabolical conspiracy, which is worse and far more to be abhorred than any dispersion? Let us therefore remember that we ought always to 			 begin with the Head. Hence also the Prophets, when they describe the restoration of the Church, always join David the king with God; as if they said, that there is no Church where Christ does not reign, and that there is no kingdom of God, but where the honor of <i>shepherd </i>is granted to Christ.</p>

And even at the present day, we ought to contemplate the death of Christ, so as to remember, at the same time, the glory of his resurrection.

It is otherwise with us, for we are laid under a necessity of dying on account of our sins. True, Christ himself was born a mortal man; but this was a voluntary submission, and not a bondage laid upon him by another. Christ intended, therefore, to fortify his disciples, that, when they saw him shortly afterwards dragged to death, they might not be dismayed, as if he had been oppressed by enemies, but might 			 acknowledge that it was done by the wonderful Providence of God, that he should die for the redemption of his flock.

If that profession had been sincere, Christ, who is the strongest bond of charity, and whose office it is to gather those things which are scattered, would not 			 break up their agreement.

Yet the truth is, that, if they would yield submissively to Christ, and give their support to the truth, all the commotions would immediately be allayed. But when they utter murmurs and complaints against Christ, and will not allow us to be at rest on any other condition than that the truth of God shall be extinguished, and that Christ shall be banished from his kingdom, they have no right to accuse us of the crime of schism; for it is on themselves, as 			 every person sees, that this crime ought to be charged. We ought to be deeply grieved that the Church is torn by <i>divisions </i>arising among those who profess the same religion; but it is better that there are some who separate themselves from the wicked, to be united to Christ their Head, than that all should be of one mind in despising God.

 <p class="Center"><a name="xvi.v-p20"></a>Come to me, all you who labor and are heavy laden, and I will refresh you, and your souls shall find rest,<br> 			 (<a name="xvi.v-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Matt. 11:28</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029">29</a><a name="xvi.v-p20.2"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.v-p21"></a>Therefore, those who come to Christ ought to be prepared in the same manner as those men pretend to be. But they are wrong in accusing Christ, as if he had not hitherto confirmed their faith; for it was entirely their own fault that they had not a full and perfect knowledge of him. But this is always the case with unbelievers, that they choose rather to remain in doubt than to be founded on the certainty of the word of God. Thus, in our own 			 day, we see many who voluntarily shut their eyes, and spread the clouds of their doubt, in order to darken the clear light of the Gospel. We see also many light spirits, who fly about in idle speculations, and never find, throughout their whole life, a permanent abode.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.v-p22"></a><i>Tell us plainly.</i> When they demand that Christ shall declare himself<i> freely</i>, or openly and boldly, their meaning is, that he may no longer convey his meaning indirectly, and in a circuitous manner. Thus they charge his doctrine with 			 obscurity, which, on the contrary, was abundantly plain and distinct, if the men who heard it had not been deaf. Now this history warns us, that we cannot avoid the artifices and slanders of wicked men, if we are called to preach the Gospel. Wherefore, we ought to be on the watch, and not to be surprised at it as a new thing, when the same thing happens to us as to our Master.</p>

He twice 			 repeats the words, <i>You do not believe</i>, in order to prove that, of their own accord, they were deaf to doctrine, and blind to works; which is a proof of extreme and desperate malice.

 <p><a name="xvi.v-p28"></a><b>26. </b><i>Because you are not of my sheep.</i> He assigns a higher reason why they do not believe either in his miracles or in his doctrine. It is, because they are reprobate. We must observe Christ’s design; for, since they boasted of being the Church of God, that their unbelief may detract nothing from the authority of 			 the Gospel, he affirms that the gift of <i>believing</i> is a special gift. And, indeed, <i>before that men know God</i>,<i> they must first be known by him</i>, as Paul says, (<a name="xvi.v-p28.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal004.htm#009">Ga 4:9</a><a name="xvi.v-p28.1"></a>.) On the other hand, 			 those to whom God does not look must always continue to look away from him. If any one murmur at this, arguing that the cause of unbelief dwells in God, because he alone has power to make <i>sheep</i>; I reply, He is free from all blame, for it is only by their voluntary malice that men reject his grace. God does all that is necessary to induce them to believe, but who shall tame wild 			 beasts?   			  <a name="fr_299"></a><a href="#fn_299"><font size="1">300</font></a>
  			  This will never be done, till the Spirit of God change them into <i>sheep</i>  They who are wild will in vain attempt to throw on God the blame of their wildness, for it belongs to their own nature. In short, Christ means that it is not wonderful, if there are few who obey his Gospel, because all whom the Spirit of God does not subdue to the obedience of faith are wild and 			 fierce beasts. So much the more unreasonable and absurd is it, that the authority of the Gospel should depend on the belief of men; but believers ought rather to consider, that they are the more strongly bound to God, because, while others remain in a state of blindness, they are drawn to Christ by the illumination of the Spirit. Here, too, the ministers of the Gospel have ground of consolation, if their labor be not profitable to 			 all.</p>

For God effectually calls all whom he has elected, so that the <i>sheep </i>of Christ are proved by their faith. And, indeed, the reason why the name of <i>sheep </i>is applied to believers is, that they surrender themselves to God, to be governed by the hand of the Chief Shepherd, and, laying aside the fierceness of their nature, become mild and teachable. It is no small consolation to faithful teachers, that, though the greater part of the world do not listen to Christ, yet he has 			 his <i>sheep whom he knows</i>,<i> and by whom he is also known</i>  Let them do their utmost to bring the whole world into the fold of Christ; but when they do not succeed according to their wish, let them be satisfied with this single consideration, that they who are <i>sheep </i>will be gathered by their agency.

 <p><a name="xvi.v-p33"></a><b>28. </b><i>And they shall never perish.</i> It is an inestimable fruit of faith, that Christ bids us be convinced of our security when we are brought by faith into his fold. But we must also observe on what foundation this certainty rests. It is because he will be a faithful guardian of our salvation, for he testifies that 			 our salvation is in <i>his hand</i>  And if this were not enough, he says that they will be safely guarded by the power of <i>his Father</i>  This is a remarkable passage, by which we are taught that the salvation of all the elect is not less certain than the power of God 			 is invincible. Besides, Christ did not intend to throw this word foolishly into the air, but to give a promise which should remain deeply axed in their minds; and, therefore, we infer that the statement of Christ is intended to show that the elect are absolutely certain of their salvation. We are surrounded, indeed, by powerful adversaries, and so great is our weakness, that we are every moment in imminent danger of death; but as He who <i>keeps what we have committed to 			 him </i>(<a name="xvi.v-p33.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#012">2Ti 1:12</a><a name="xvi.v-p33.1"></a>) is <i>greater </i>or more powerful <i>than all</i>, we have no reason to tremble as if our life were in danger.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.v-p34"></a>Hence, too, we infer how mad is the confidence of the Papists, which relies on free-will, on their own virtue, and on the merits of their works. Widely different is the manner in which Christ instructs his followers, to remember that, in this world, they may be said to be in the midst of a forest, surrounded by innumerable robbers, and are not only unarmed and exposed as a prey, but are aware that the cause of death is contained in themselves, 			 so that, relying on the guardianship of God alone, they may walk without alarm. In short, our salvation is certain, because it is <i>in the hand </i>of God; for our faith is weak, and we are too prone to waver. But God, who has taken us under his protection, is sufficiently powerful to scatter, with his breath alone, all the forces of our adversaries. It is of great importance for us to turn our eye to this, that the fear of temptations may not dismay us; for Christ even intended to point out 			 the way in which <i>sheep </i>are made to live at ease in the midst of wolves.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.v-p35"></a><i>And none can wrest them out of my Father’s hand.</i> The word <i>and, </i>in this passage, means <i>therefore</i>  For, since the power of God is invincible, Christ infers that the salvation of believers is 			 not exposed to the ungovernable passions of their enemies, because, ere they perish, God must be overcome, who has taken them under the protection of <i>his hand.</i></p>

This result 			 shows with what intention they put the question to Christ; for the open confession, of which they pretended to be desirous, instantly drives them to madness. And yet, though they are hurried along, with such violence, to oppress Christ, there can be no doubt that they assigned some plausible reason for their judgment, as if they were acting according to the injunction of the Law, by which God commands that false prophets shall be stoned, (<a name="xvi.vi-p5.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu013.htm#005">Deuteronomy 13:5</a><a name="xvi.vi-p5.1"></a>.)</p>

Nor does he only state that he has done them a service by one or two works, but that in many ways he has been kind to them. 			 Next, he upbraids them with being ungrateful, not only to himself, but rather to God, when he says that he is the minister of the Father, who openly manifested his power, that it might be known and attested to them. For when he says that <i>the good works</i> were<i> from the Father</i>, he means that God was the Author of them. The meaning may be thus summed up, “God intended to make known to you, by me, distinguished benefits; he has conferred them upon you by my hand. Banish me as much as you please, I have done nothing that does not deserve praise and good-will. In persecuting me, therefore, you must show your rage against the gifts of God.” But the question has greater force to pierce their consciences than if he had made a direct 			 assertion.</p>

 <p><a name="xvi.vi-p9"></a><b>33.</b> <i>We stone thee not for a good work.</i> Though wicked men carry on open war with God, yet they never wish to sin without some plausible pretense. The consequence is, that when they rage against the Son of God, they are not content with this cruelty, but bring an unprovoked accusation 			 against him, and constitute themselves advocates and defenders of the glory of God. A good conscience must therefore be to us a wall of brass, by which we boldly repel the reproaches and calumnies with which we are assailed. For whatever plausibility may adorn their malice, and whatever reproach they may bring on us for a time, if we fight for the cause of God, he will not refuse to uphold his truth. But as the wicked never want pretences for oppressing the servants of God, and as they have 			 also hardened impudence, so that, even when vanquished, they do not cease to slander, we have need of patience and meekness, to support us to the end.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.vi-p10"></a><i>But for blasphemy.</i> The word <i>blasphemy,</i> which among profane authors denotes generally every kind of reproach, Scripture refers to God, when his majesty is offended and insulted.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.vi-p11"></a><i>Because thou, being a man, makest thyself God.</i> There are two kinds of <i>blasphemy,</i> either when God is deprived of the honor which belongs to him, or when anything unsuitable to his nature, or contrary to his nature, is 			 ascribed to him. They argue therefore that Christ is a <i>blasphemer </i>and a sacrilegious person, because, <i>being a mortal man</i>, he lays claim to Divine honor. And this would be a just definition of <i>blasphemy,</i> if Christ were nothing more 			 than a man. They only err in this, that they do not design to contemplate his Divinity, which was conspicuous in his miracles.</p>

 <p><a name="xvi.vi-p13"></a><b>34.</b> <i>Is it not written in your Law?</i> He clears himself of the crime charged against him, not by denying that he is the Son of God, but by maintaining that he had justly said so. Yet he adapts his reply to the persons, instead of giving a 			 full explanation of the fact; for he reckoned it enough for the present to expose their malice. In what sense he called himself the Son of God he does not explain fully, but states indirectly. The argument which he employs is not drawn from equals, but from the less to the greater.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.vi-p14"></a><i>I said, You are gods.</i> Scripture gives the name of<i> gods </i>to those on whom God has conferred an honorable office. He whom God has separated, to be distinguished above all others, is far more worthy of this honorable title. Hence it follows, that they are malicious 			 and false expounders of Scripture, who admit the first, but take offense at the second. The passage which Christ quotes is in <a name="xvi.vi-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa082.htm#006">Ps 82:6</a><a name="xvi.vi-p14.2"></a>,</p>

He reproaches them that, unmindful of Him from whom they received so great dignity, they profane the name of God. Christ applies this to the case in hand, that they receive the name of <i>gods</i>, because they are God’s ministers for governing the world. For the same reason Scripture calls the angels <i>gods</i>, because by them the glory of God beams forth on the world. We must attend to the mode of expression:</p>

Hence we infer that empires did not spring up at random, nor by the mistakes of men, but that they were appointed by the will of God, because he wishes that political 			 order should exist among men, and that we should be governed by usages and laws. For this reason Paul says, that all who</p>

In short, let us know that magistrates are called <i>gods</i>, because God has given them authority. Under the term <i>Law,</i> Christ includes the whole doctrine by which God governed his ancient Church; for since the prophets were only expounders of the Law, the Psalms are justly regarded as an appendage to the Law. That <i>the Scripture cannot be broken</i> means, that the doctrine of Scripture is inviolable.</p>

 <p><a name="xvi.vi-p22"></a><b>36.</b> <i>Whom the Father hath sanctified.</i> There is a <i>sanctification </i>that is common to all believers. But here Christ claims for himself something far more excellent, namely, that he alone was separated from all others, that the power of the 			 Spirit and the majesty of God might be displayed in him; as he formerly said, that <i>him hath God the Father sealed</i>, (<a name="xvi.vi-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#027">Joh 6:27</a><a name="xvi.vi-p22.1"></a>.)

Accordingly, these two things are joined, that he has been 			 <i>sanctified and sent into the world.</i> But we must also understand for what reason and on what condition <i>he was sent</i>  It was to bring salvation from God, and to prove and exhibit himself, in every possible way, to be <i>the Son of 			 God.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.vi-p23"></a><i>Do you say that I blaspheme?</i> The Arians anciently tortured this passage to prove that Christ is not God by nature, but that he possesses a kind of borrowed Divinity.

For we 			 can never comprehend his eternal Divinity, unless we embrace him as a Redeemer, so far as the Father hath exhibited him to us. Besides, we ought to remember what I have formerly suggested, that Christ does not, in this passage, explain fully and distinctly what he is, as he would have done among his disciples; but that he rather dwells on refuting the slander of his enemies.</p>  <a name="xvi.vii"></a>

 <p><a name="xvi.vii-p24"></a><i>John indeed did no miracle.</i> They infer that Christ is more excellent than <i>John</i>, because he has distinguished himself by so many miracles, while <i>John did not perform a single miracle</i>  Not that we ought always to judge from <i>miracles,</i> but that <i>miracles</i>, when united with doctrine, have no small weight, as has already been repeatedly mentioned. Their argument is 			 defective; for they compare Christ with John, but they express only one part of the comparison. Besides, they take for granted, that John was an eminent prophet of God, and that he was endued with extraordinary grace of the Holy Spirit. They justly argue, therefore, that Christ ought to be preferred to John, because it was only by the fixed Providence of God that it was brought about that <i>John, 			 </i>though in other respects a very great prophet, yet was not honored by performing any miracle. Hence they conclude, that this was done on Christ’s account, that he might be more highly esteemed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xvi.vii-p25"></a><i>But all that John said.</i> It appears that this was not spoken by themselves, but was added by the Evangelist, in order to show that there were two reasons which induced them to believe in Christ. On the one hand,   			  <a name="fr_306"></a><a href="#fn_306"><font size="1">307</font></a>
  			  they saw that the testimony which John had given to him was true; and, on the other hand,   			  <a name="fr_307"></a><a href="#fn_307"><font size="1">308</font></a>
  			  the miracles of Christ procured for him greater authority.</p>
