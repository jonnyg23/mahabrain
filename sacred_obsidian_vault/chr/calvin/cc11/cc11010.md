 <p class="BOOK-CHAP-BLU-24-CEN18"><a name="xi-p1"></a>PSALM 102</p>  		
 <p><a name="xi-p2"></a>This prayer seems to have been dictated to the faithful when they were languishing in captivity in Babylon. Sorrowful and humbled, they first bewail their afflictions. In the next place, they plead with God for the restoration of the holy city and temple. To encourage themselves to come before him in prayer with the greater confidence, they call to remembrance the Divine promises in reference to the happy renovation both of the kingdom and of the 		  priesthood; and they not only assure themselves of deliverance from captivity, but also beseech God to bring kings and nations in subjection to himself. In the close of the psalm, after having interposed a brief complaint concerning their distressing and afflicted condition, they draw consolation from the eternity of God; for, in adopting his servants to a better hope, he has separated them from the common lot of men.</p>  		
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent28"><a name="xi-p3"></a>A prayer for the afflicted, when he shall be shut up, and shall pour out his meditation before Jehovah.</p>  		
 <p><a name="xi-p4"></a>Whoever of the prophets composed this psalm, it is certain that he dictated it to the faithful as a form of prayer for the re-establishment of the temple and the city. Some limit it to the time when, after the return of the Jews from Babylon, the building of the temple was hindered by the neighboring nations; but with this I cannot agree. I am rather of opinion that the poem was written before the return of the people, when the 		  time of their promised deliverance was just at hand; for then the prophets began to be more earnest in lifting up the hearts of the godly according to these words of Isaiah, (<a name="xi-p4.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa040.htm#001">Isa 40:1</a><a name="xi-p4.1"></a>) “Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.”   		   <a name="fr_132"></a><a href="#fn_132"><font size="1">133</font></a>
  		   The design of the sacred poet was, not only to inspire the people with courage, but also to excite in them greater care about the welfare of the Church. The title of the psalm indicates the end and purpose which it was intended to serve. Those who translate the verbs in the past tense, <i>A prayer for the afflicted, when he was in distress, and poured out his meditation,</i>   		   <a name="fr_133"></a><a href="#fn_133"><font size="1">134</font></a>
  		   seem to give an incorrect view of the mind of the prophet. He rather intended to relieve the sorrow of those whose hearts he saw depressed; as if he had said, Although you may be afflicted with anguish and despair, you must not on that account desist from prayer. Some translate the verb <a name="xi-p6.2"></a>עטף, <i>ataph, when he shall hide 		  himself, </i>and conceive that this is a metaphorical expression of the gesture of a man engaged in prayer, when, on account of his grief, unable to lift up his face, he, as it were, hides himself, and keeps his head wrapped up in his bosom. But there appears to me to be an elegant play upon the words, when the distresses of the mind, and its being <i>shut up, </i>are spoken of, on the one hand, and <i>the 		  pouring out </i>of prayers on the other; teaching us that, when we are so shut up by grief as to shun the light and presence of men, the gate is so far from being shut against our prayers, that then in truth is the most proper season for engaging in prayer, for it is a singular alleviation of our sorrows when we have opportunity freely to pour out our hearts before God. The verb <a name="xi-p6.3"></a>שוח, <i>suach, </i>often denotes <i>to pray; </i>but, as it also signifies <i>to meditate, </i>the noun derived from it properly means, in this place, <i>meditation. </i>It is, moreover, to be observed that, by these words, the Psalmist admonishes the Israelites as to the frame of mind with which it became them to 		  use this form of prayer at the throne of grace; as if he had said, that he prescribed it to those only who were distressed on account of the desolate condition of the Church.</p>  <a name="xi.i"></a>  		   			  				   				
 <p class="TableCaption20"><a name="xi.i-p1"></a><a name="xi.i-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa102.htm#001">Psalm 102:1-2</a><a name="xi.i-p1.1"></a></p> 				  			  				   				
 <p><a name="xi.i-p2"></a><b>1.</b> O Jehovah! hear my prayer, and let my cry come to thee. <b>2.</b> Hide not thy face from me in the day of my affliction; incline thy ear to me: in the day when I cry make haste, answer me.</p>

 <p><a name="xi.i-p5"></a><b>1</b> <i> O Jehovah! hear my prayer</i> This earnestness shows, again, that these words were not dictated to be pronounced by the careless and light-hearted, which could not have been done without grossly insulting God. In speaking thus, the captive Jews bear testimony to the severe and excruciating 			 distress which they endured, and to the ardent desire to obtain some alleviation with which they were inflamed. No person could utter these words with the mouth without profaning the name of God, unless he were, at the same time, actuated by a sincere and earnest affection of heart. We ought particularly to attend to the circumstance already adverted to, that we are thus stirred up by the Holy Spirit to the duty of prayer in behalf of the common welfare of the Church. Whilst each man takes 			 sufficient care of his own individual interests, there is scarcely one in a hundred affected as he ought to be with the calamities of the Church. We have, therefore, the more need of incitements, even as we see the prophet here endeavoring, by an accumulation of words, to correct our coldness and sloth. I admit that the heart ought to move and direct the tongue to prayer; but, as it often flags or performs its duty in a slow and sluggish manner, it requires to be aided by the tongue. There is 			 here a reciprocal influence. As the heart, on the one hand, ought to go before the words, and frame them, so the tongue, on the other, aids and remedies the coldness and torpor of the heart. True believers may indeed often pray not only earnestly but also fervently, while yet not a single word proceeds from the mouth. There is, however, no doubt that by <i>crying</i> the prophet means the 			 vehemence into which grief constrains us to break forth.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.i-p6"></a><a name="xi.i-p6.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.i-p7"></a><b>2</b>  <i>Hide not thy face from me in the day of my affliction</i> The prayer, that God would not hide his face, is far from being superfluous. As the people had been languishing in captivity for the space of nearly seventy years, it might seem that God had for ever turned 			 away his favor from them. But they are, notwithstanding, commanded, in their extreme affliction, to have recourse to prayer as their only remedy. They affirm that they cry <i>in the day of their affliction, </i>not as hypocrites are accustomed to do, who utter their complaints in a tumultuous manner, but because they feel that they are then called upon by God to cry to him.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.i-p8"></a><i>Make haste, answer me</i> Having elsewhere spoken more fully of these forms of expression, it may suffice, at present, briefly to observe, that when God permits us to lay open before him our infirmities without reserve, and patiently bears with our foolishness, he deals in a way of great tenderness towards us. To pour out our complaints before 			 him after the manner of little children would certainly be to treat his Majesty with very little reverence, were it not that he has been pleased to allow us such freedom. I purposely make use of this illustration, that the weak, who are afraid to draw near to God, may understand that they are invited to him with such gentleness as that nothing may hinder them from familiarly and confidently approaching him.</p>  <a name="xi.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xi.ii-p13"></a><b>3</b>  <i>For my days are consumed like smoke</i> These expressions are hyperbolical, but still they show how deeply the desolation of the Church ought to wound the hearts of the people of God. Let every man, therefore, carefully examine himself on this head. If we do not 			 prefer the Church to all the other objects of our solicitude, we are unworthy of being accounted among her members. Whenever we meet with such forms of expression as these, let us remember that they reproach our slothfulness in not being affected with the afflictions of the Church as we ought. The Psalmist compares his days <i>to smoke, </i>and <i>his bones to the stones of the hearth, </i>which, in the course of time, are consumed by the fire. By <i>bones</i> he means the strength of man. And, were not men devoid of feeling, such a melancholy spectacle of the wrath of God would assuredly have the effect of drying up their bones, and wasting away their whole 			 rigor.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.ii-p14"></a><a name="xi.ii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.ii-p15"></a><b>4</b>  <i>My heart is smitten, and dried up like grass</i> Here he employs a third similitude, declaring that his heart is withered, and wholly dried up like mown grass. But he intends to express something more than that his heart was withered, and his bones reduced to a 			 state of dryness. His language implies, that as the grass, when it is cut down, can no longer receive juice from the earth, nor retain the life and rigor which it derived from the root, so his heart being, as it were, torn and cut off from its root, was deprived of its natural nourishment. The meaning of the last clause, <i>I have forgotten to eat my bread, </i>is, My sorrow has been so 			 great, that I have neglected my ordinary food. The Jews, it is true, during their captivity in Babylon, did eat their food; and it would have been an evidence of their having fallen into sinful despair, had they starved themselves to death. But what he means to say is, that he was so afflicted with sorrow as to refuse all delights, and to deprive himself even of food and drink. True believers may cease for a time to partake of their ordinary food, when, by voluntary fasting, they humbly beseech 			 God to turn away his wrath, but the prophet does not here speak of that kind of abstinence from bodily sustenance. He speaks of such as is the effect of extreme mental distress, which is accompanied with a loathing of food, and a weariness of all things. In the close of the verse, he adds, that his body was, as it were, consuming or wasting away, so that his bones clave to his skin.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.ii-p16"></a><a name="xi.ii-p16.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.ii-p17"></a><b>6</b>  <i>I have become like a pelican of the wilderness</i> Instead of rendering the original word by <i>pelican, </i>some translate it <i>bittern, </i>and others the <i>cuckoo. </i>The Hebrew word here used for <i>owl</i> is rendered by the Septuagint <a name="xi.ii-p17.1"></a>νυκτικοραξ, which signifies <i>a bat.</i>   			  <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">141</font></a>
  			  But as even the Jews are doubtful as to the kind of birds here intended, let it suffice us simply to know, that in this verse there are pointed out certain melancholy birds, whose place of abode is in the holes of mountains and in deserts, and whose note, instead of being delightful and sweet to the ear, inspires those who hear it with terror. I am removed, as if he had said, from the society of men, and am become almost like a wild beast of 			 the forest. Although the people of God dwelt in a well cultivated and fertile region, yet the whole country of Chaldea and Assyria was to them like a wilderness, since their hearts were bound by the strongest ties of affection to the temple, and to their native country from which they had been expelled. The third similitude, which is taken from <i>the sparrow, </i>denotes such grief as produces the greatest uneasiness. The word <a name="xi.ii-p18.2"></a>צפור, <i>tsippor, </i>signifies in general any kind of bird; but I have no doubt that it is here to be understood of the sparrow. It is described as <i>solitary </i>or <i>alone, </i>because it has been bereaved of its mate; and so deeply affected are these little birds when 			 separated from their mates, that their distress exceeds almost all sorrow.   			  <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">142</font></a>

 <p><a name="xi.iii-p8"></a><b>8.</b> <i>My enemies have reviled me daily</i> The faithful, to excite the compassion of God towards them, tell him that they are not only objects of mockery to their enemies, but also that they swore by them. The indignity complained of is, that the ungodly so shamefully triumphed over God’s 			 chosen people, as even to borrow from their calamities a form of swearing and imprecation. This was to regard the fate of the Jews as a signal pattern in uttering the language of imprecation. When, therefore, at the present day the ungodly, in like manner, give themselves loose reins in pouring forth against us contumelious language, let us learn to fortify ourselves with this armor, by which such kind of temptation, however sharp, may be overcome. The Holy Spirit, in dictating to the faithful 			 this form of prayer, meant to testify that God is moved by such revilings to succor his people; even as we find it stated in <a name="xi.iii-p8.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa037.htm#023">Isa 37:23</a><a name="xi.iii-p8.1"></a>,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xi.iii-p9"></a>“Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed, and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice? even against the Holy One of Israel;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iii-p10"></a>and in the verse immediately preceding the prophet had said, “He hath despised thee, O daughter of Zion! against thee hath he shaken the head, O daughter of Jerusalem!” It is surely an inestimable comfort that the more insolent our enemies are against us, the more is God incited to gird himself to aid us. In the second clause the inspired writer expresses more strongly the cruelty of his enemies, when he speaks of their 			 being <i>mad against him</i> As the verb <a name="xi.iii-p10.1"></a>הלל, <i>halal, </i>which we have rendered <i>mad, </i>generally signifies <i>to praise, </i>it might here be understood as having, by the figure antiphrasis, a sense the very opposite — <i>those who dispraised </i>or <i>reproached me. </i>But it is better to follow the commonly received interpretation. Some maintain that they are called <i>mad, </i>because they manifested their own folly, making it evident from the manner in which they acted, that they were worthless persons; but this opinion does too much violence to the text. The more satisfactory sense is, that the people of God charge revilers with cruelty or furious hatred.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.iii-p11"></a><a name="xi.iii-p11.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iii-p12"></a><b>9</b>  <i>For I have eaten ashes like bread</i> Some think that the order is here inverted, and that the letter <a name="xi.iii-p12.1"></a>כ, <i>caph, </i>the sign of similitude, which is put before <a name="xi.iii-p12.2"></a>לחם, <i>lechem, </i>the word for <i>bread, </i>ought to be placed before <a name="xi.iii-p12.3"></a>אפר, 			 <i>epher, </i>the word for<i> ashes; </i>as if it had been said, I find no more relish for my bread than I do for ashes; and the reason is, because sorrow of heart produces loathing of food. But the simpler meaning is, that lying prostrate on the ground, they licked, as it were, the earth, <i>and so did eat ashes instead of 			 bread. </i>It was customary for those who mourned to stretch themselves at full length with their faces on the ground. The prophet, however, intended to express a different idea — to intimate, that when he partook of his meals, there was no table set before him, but his bread was thrown upon the ground to him in a foul and disgusting manner. Speaking, therefore, in the person of the faithful, he asserts that he was so fixed to the ground that he did not even rise from it to 			 take his food. The same sentiment is expressed in the last part of the verse<i>, I have mingled my drink with weeping; </i>for while mourners usually restrain their sorrow during the short time in which they refresh themselves with food, he declares that his mourning was without intermission. Some, instead of reading in the first clause, <i>as bread, </i>read, <i>in bread; </i>  			  <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">144</font></a>
  			  and as the two letters, <a name="xi.iii-p13.5"></a>כ, <i>caph, </i>and <a name="xi.iii-p13.6"></a>ב, <i>beth, </i>nearly resemble each other, I prefer reading <i>in bread, 			 </i>which agrees better with the second clause.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.iii-p14"></a><a name="xi.iii-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iii-p15"></a><b>10.</b> <i>On account of thy anger and thy wrath</i> He now declares that the greatness of his grief proceeded not only from outward troubles and calamities, but from a sense that these were a punishment inflicted upon him by God. And surely there is nothing which ought to wound our hearts more 			 deeply, than when we feel that God is angry with us. The meaning then amounts to this — O Lord! I do not confine my attention to those things which would engage the mind of worldly men; but I rather turn my thoughts to thy wrath; for were it not that thou art angry with us, we would have been still enjoying the inheritance given us by thee, from which we have justly been expelled by thy displeasure. When God then strikes us with his hand, we should not merely groan under the strokes inflicted 			 upon us, as foolish men usually do, but should chiefly look to the cause that we may be truly humbled. This is a lesson which it would be of great advantage to us to learn.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iii-p16"></a>The last clause of the verse, <i>Thou hast lifted me up, and cast me down, </i>may be understood in two ways. As we lift up what we intend to throw down with greater violence against the ground, the sentence may denote a violent method of casting down, as if it had been said, Thou hast crushed me more severely by 			 throwing me down headlong from on high, than if I had merely fallen from the station which I occupied.   			  <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">145</font></a>
  			  But this seems to be another amplification of his grief, nothing being more bitter to an individual than to be reduced from a happy condition to extreme misery, the prophet mournfully complains that the chosen people were deprived of the distinguished advantages which God had conferred upon them in time past, so that the very remembrance of his former goodness, which should have afforded consolation to them, embittered their sorrow. Nor was it the effect of 			 ingratitude to turn the consideration of the divine benefits, which they had formerly received, into matter of sadness; since they acknowledged that their being reduced to such a state of wretchedness and degradation was through their own sins. God has no delight in changing, as if, after having given us some taste of his goodness, he intended forthwith to deprive us of it. As his goodness is inexhaustible, so his blessing would flow upon us 			 without intermission, were it not for our sins which break off the course of it. Although, then, the remembrance of God’s benefits ought to assuage our sorrows, yet still it is a great aggravation of our calamity to have fallen from an elevated position, and to find that we have so provoked his anger, as to make him withdraw from us his benignant and bountiful hand. Thus when we consider that the image of God, which distinguished Adam, was the brightness of the celestial glory; and when, on the 			 contrary, we now see the ignominy and degradation to which God has subjected us in token of his wrath, this contrast cannot surely fail of making us feel more deeply the wretchedness of our condition. Whenever, therefore, God, after having stripped us of the blessings which he had conferred upon us, gives us up to reproach, let us learn that we have so much the greater cause to lament, because, through our own fault, we have turned light into darkness.</p>

  			  When the sun is directly over our heads, that is to say, at mid-day, we do not observe such sudden changes of the shadows which his light produces; but when he begins to decline towards the west the shadows vary almost every moment, This is the reason why the sacred writer expressly makes mention of <i>the shadow which declineth</i> What he attributes to the afflicted Church seems indeed to be equally applicable to all men; but he had a special reason for employing this comparison to illustrate the condition of the Church when subjected to the calamity of exile. It is true, that as soon as we advance towards old age, we speedily fall into decay. But the complaint here is, that this befell the people of God in the very flower of their age. By the term <i>days</i> is to be understood the whole course of their life; and the meaning is, that the captivity was to the godly as the setting of the sun, because they quickly failed. In the end of the verse the similitude of <i>withered grass, </i>used a little before, is repeated, to intimate that their life during the 			 captivity was involved in many sorrows which dried up in them the very sap of life. Nor is this wonderful, since to live in that condition would have been worse than a hundred deaths had they not been sustained by the hope of future deliverance. But although they were not altogether overwhelmed by temptation, they must have been in great distress, because they saw themselves abandoned by God.</p>  <a name="xi.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="xi.iv-p5"></a><b>12.</b> <i>And thou, O Jehovah! shalt dwell for ever</i> When the prophet, for his own encouragement, sets before himself the eternity of God, it seems, at first sight, to be a far-fetched consolation; for what benefit will accrue to us from the fact that God sits immutable on his heavenly throne, 			 when, at the same time, our frail and perishing condition does not permit us to continue unmoved for a single moment? And, what is more, this knowledge of the blessed repose enjoyed by God enables us the better to perceive that our life is a mere illusion. But the inspired writer, calling to remembrance the promises by which God had declared that he would make the Church the object of his special care, and particularly that remarkable article of the covenant, “I will dwell in the midst of you,” 			 (<a name="xi.iv-p5.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo025.htm#008">Ex 25:8</a><a name="xi.iv-p5.1"></a>) and, trusting to that sacred and indissoluble bond, has no hesitation in representing all the godly languishing, though they were in a state of suffering and wretchedness, as partakers of this celestial glory in which God dwells. The word <i>memorial</i> is also to be 			 viewed in the same light. What advantage would we derive from this eternity and immutability of God’s being, unless we had in our hearts the knowledge of him, which, produced by his gracious covenant, begets in us the confidence arising from a mutual relationship between him and us? The meaning then is, “We are like withered grass, we are decaying every moment, we are not far from death, yea rather, we are, as it were, already dwelling in the grave; but since thou, O God! hast made a covenant 			 with us, by which thou hast promised to protect and defend thine own people, and hast brought thyself into a gracious relation to us, giving us the fullest assurance that thou wilt always dwell in the midst of us, instead of desponding, we must be of good courage; and although we may see only ground for despair if we depend upon ourselves, we ought nevertheless to lift up our minds to the heavenly throne, from which thou wilt at length stretch forth thy hand to help us.” Whoever is in a 			 moderate degree acquainted with the sacred writings, will readily acknowledge that whenever we are besieged with death, in a variety of forms, we should reason thus: As God continues unchangeably the same — “without variableness or shadow of turning” — nothing can hinder him from aiding us; and this he will do, because we have his word, by which he has laid himself under obligation to us, and because he has deposited with us his own memorial, which contains in it a sacred and indissoluble bond 			 of fellowship.</p>

 <p><a name="xi.iv-p7"></a><b>13.</b> <i>Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion</i>. We have here the conclusion drawn from the truth stated in the preceding verse — God is eternal, and therefore he will have compassion upon Zion. God’s eternity is to be considered as impressed upon the memorial, or word, by which he has brought himself under 			 obligation to maintain our welfare. Besides, as he is not destitute of the power, and as it is impossible for him to deny himself, we ought not to entertain any apprehension of his failing to accomplish, in his own time, what he has promised. We have observed, in another place, that, the verb <i>to arise </i>refers to what is made apparent to the eye of sense; for although he continues always immutable, yet, in 			 putting forth his power, he manifests his majesty by the external act, as it is termed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p8"></a>When the prophet treats of the restoration of the Church, he sets forth the divine mercy as its cause. He represents this mercy under a twofold aspect, and therefore employs different words. In the first place, as in the matter under consideration, the good deserts of men are entirely out of the question, and as God cannot be led from any cause external to himself to build up his Church, the prophet traces the cause of it 			 solely to the free goodness of God. In the second place, he contemplates this mercy as connected with the Divine promises. <i>Thou shalt have mercy upon Zion, for the time appointed, according to thy good pleasure, is come</i> Meanwhile, it is to be observed that, in magnifying the Divine mercy, his design was to teach true believers that their safety depended on it alone. But we must now 			 attend to what time is alluded to. The word <a name="xi.iv-p8.1"></a>מועד, <i>moed, </i>signifies all kind of fixed or appointed days. There is, then, beyond all doubt, a reference to the prophecy of Jeremiah, recorded in <a name="xi.iv-p8.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010">Jer 29:10</a><a name="xi.iv-p8.2"></a>, and repeated in the last 			 chapter of the Second Book of Chronicles, at the 21st verse. That the faithful might not sink into despondency, through the long continuance of their calamities, they needed to be supported by the hope that an end to their captivity had been appointed by God, and that it would not extend beyond seventy years. Daniel was employed in meditating on this very topic, when “he set his face unto the Lord God, to seek, by prayer and supplications,” the re-establishment of the Church, (<a name="xi.iv-p8.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#002">Da 9:2</a><a name="xi.iv-p8.3"></a>) In like manner, the object now aimed at by the prophet was to encourage both himself and others to confidence in prayer, putting God in mind of this remarkable prophecy, as an argument to induce him to bring to a termination their melancholy captivity. And surely if, in our prayers, we do not continually remember the Divine promises, we only cast forth our desires into the air like smoke. It is, 			 however, to be observed, that although the time of the promised deliverance was approaching, or had already arrived, yet the prophet does not cease from the exercise of prayer, to which God stirs us up by means of his word. And although the time was fixed, yet he calls upon God, for the performance of his covenant, in such a manner, as that he is still betaking himself to his free goodness alone; for the promises by which God brings himself under obligation to us do not, in any degree, obscure 			 his grace.</p>

 <p><a name="xi.iv-p10"></a><b>14.</b> <i>For thy servants take pleasure in her stones</i> To restrict this to Cyrus and Darius is altogether unsuitable. It is not at all wonderful to find the Jewish doctors hunting, with excessive eagerness, after foolish subtilties; but I am surprised that some of our modern commentators 			 subscribe to such a poor and cold interpretation. I am aware that, in some places, the unbelieving and the wicked are called the servants of God, as in <a name="xi.iv-p10.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#009">Jer 25:9</a><a name="xi.iv-p10.1"></a>, because God makes use of them as instruments for executing his judgments. Nay, I admit that Cyrus is called by name God’s chosen servant, (<a name="xi.iv-p10.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa044.htm#028">Isa 44:28</a><a name="xi.iv-p10.2"></a>) but the Holy Spirit would not have bestowed so honorable a title, either on him or Darius, without some qualification. Besides, it is probable that this psalm was composed before the edict was published, which granted the people liberty to return to their native country. It therefore follows, that God’s people alone are included in the catalogue of his servants, because it is their purpose, during the whole of their life, to obey his 			 will in all things. The prophet, I have no doubt, speaks in general of the whole Church, intimating that this was not the wish entertained merely by one man, but was shared by the whole body of the Church. The more effectually to induce God to listen to his prayer, he calls upon all the godly, who were then in the world, to join with him in the same request. It, unquestionably, very much contributes to increase the confidence of success, when supplications are made by all the people of God 			 together, as if in the person of one man, according to what the Apostle Paul declares,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xi.iv-p11"></a>“Ye also, helping together by prayer for us, that, for the gift bestowed upon us, by the means of many persons, thanks may be given by many on our behalf.” (<a name="xi.iv-p11.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#011">2Co 1:11</a><a name="xi.iv-p11.1"></a>)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.iv-p12"></a>Farther, when the deformed materials which remained of the ruins of the temple and city are emphatically termed <i>the stones of Zion, </i>this is designed to intimate, not only that the faithful in time past were affected with the outward splendor of the temple, when, besides attracting the eyes of men, it had power to ravish with admiration all their senses, but also, that although the temple was destroyed, and nothing was to be seen where 			 it stood but hideous desolation, yet their attachment to it continued unalterable, and they acknowledged the glory of God, in its crumbling stones and decayed rubbish. As the temple was built by the appointment of God, and as he had promised its restoration, it was, doubtless, proper and becoming that the godly should not withdraw their affections from its ruins. Meanwhile, as an antidote against the discouraging influence of the taunting mockery of the heathen, they required to look into the 			 Divine word for something else than what presented itself to their bodily eyes. Knowing that the very site of the temple was consecrated to God, and that that sacred edifice was to be rebuilt on the same spot, they did not cease to regard it with reverence, although its stones lay in disorder, mutilated and broken, and heaps of useless rubbish were to be seen scattered here and there. The sadder the desolation is to which the Church has been brought, the less ought our affections to be 			 alienated from her. Yea, rather, this compassion which the faithful then exercised,  			  <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">147</font></a>
  			 ought to draw from us sighs and groans; and would to God that the melancholy description in this passage were not so applicable to our own time as it is! He, no doubt, has his churches erected in some places, where he is purely worshipped; but, if we cast our eyes upon the whole world, we behold his word every where trampled under foot, and his worship defiled by countless abominations. Such being the case, his holy temple is assuredly every where demolished, and in a state of 			 wretched desolation; yea, even those small churches in which he dwells are torn and scattered. What are these humble erections, when compared with that splendid edifice described by Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah? But no desolation ought to prevent us from loving the very stones and dust of the Church. Let us leave the Papists to be proud of their altars, their huge buildings, and their other exhibitions of pomp and splendor; for all that heathenish magnificence is nothing else but an 			 abomination in the sight of God and his angels, whereas the ruins of the true temple are sacred.</p>  <a name="xi.v"></a>

 <p><a name="xi.v-p11"></a><b>15.</b> <i>And the nations shall fear the name of Jehovah</i> The prophet here describes the fruit which would result from the deliverance of the ancient tribes; which is, that thereby God’s glory would be rendered illustrious among nations and kings. He tacitly intimates, that when the Church is 			 oppressed, the Divine glory is at the same time debased; even as the God of Israel was, no doubt, at the period referred to, derided by the ungodly, as if he had been destitute of the power to succor his people. It is therefore declared, that if he redeem them, it will afford such a remarkable proof of his power as to constrain the Gentiles to reverence him whom they contemned.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.v-p12"></a><a name="xi.v-p12.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.v-p13"></a>The concluding part of the 16th verse, <i>He hath appeared in his glory, </i>refers to the manifestation which God made of himself when he brought forth his Church from the darkness of death; even as it is said in another place concerning her first deliverance, “Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominions” 			 (<a name="xi.v-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa114.htm#002">Ps 114:2</a><a name="xi.v-p13.1"></a>) In like manner in the present passage, by again gathering to himself his people who were dispersed, and by raising his Church, as it were, from death to life, he appeared in his glory. It is surely no ordinary consolation to know that the love of God towards us is so great, that he will have his glory to shine forth in our salvation. It is true, that when the pious Jews were 			 in the midst of their afflictions, the working of divine power was hidden from them; but they nevertheless always beheld it by the eye of faith, and in the mirror of the divine promises.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.v-p14"></a><a name="xi.v-p14.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.v-p15"></a><b>17</b>  <i>He hath regarded the prayer of the solitary</i> It is worthy of notice, that the deliverance of the chosen tribes is ascribed to the prayers of the faithful. God’s mercy was indeed the sole cause which led him to deliver his Church, according as he had graciously 			 promised this blessing to her; but to stir up true believers to greater earnestness in prayer, he promises that what he has purposed to do of his own good pleasure, he will grant in answer to their requests. Nor is there any inconsistency between these two truths, that God preserves the Church in the exercise of his free mercy, and that he preserves her in answer to the prayers of his people; for as their prayers are connected with the free promises, the effect of the former depends entirely 			 upon the latter. When it is said, that <i>the prayers of the solitary</i> were heard, it is not to be understood of one man only, (for in the clause immediately following, the plural number is used;) but all the Jews, so long as they remained ejected from their own country, and lived as exiles in a strange land, are called <i>solitary, </i>because, although the countries of Assyria and Chaldea were remarkably fertile and delightful, yet these wretched captives, as I have previously observed, wandered there as in a wilderness. And as at that time this solitary people obtained favor by sighing, so now when the faithful are scattered, and are without their regular assemblies, the Lord will hear their groanings in this desolate dispersion, provided 			 they all with one consent, and with unfeigned faith, earnestly breathe after the restoration of the Church.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.v-p16"></a><a name="xi.v-p16.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.v-p17"></a><b>18.</b> <i>This shall be registered for the generation that is to come</i> The Psalmist magnifies still more the fruit of the deliverance of his people, for the purpose of encouraging himself and others in the hope of obtaining the object of their prayers. He intimates, that this will be a memorable 			 work of God, the praise of which shall be handed down to succeeding ages. Many things are worthy of praise, which are soon forgotten; but the prophet distinguishes between the salvation of the Church, for which he makes supplication, and common benefits. By the word <i>register, </i>he means that the history of this would be worthy of having a place in the public records, that the 			 remembrance of it might be transmitted to future generations. There is in the words a beautiful contrast between the new creation of the people and the present destruction; of which interpreters improperly omit to take any notice. When the people were expelled from their country, the Church was in a manner extinguished. Her very name might seem to be dead, when the Jews were mingled among the heathen nations, and no longer constituted a distinct and united body. Their return was accordingly as 			 it were a second birth. Accordingly, the prophet with propriety expects a new creation. Although the Church had perished, he was persuaded that God, by his wonderful power, would make her rise again from death to renovated life. This is a remarkable passage, showing that the Church is not always so preserved, as to continue to outward appearance to survive, but that when she seems to be dead, she is suddenly created anew, whenever it so pleases God. Let no desolation, therefore, which befalls 			 the Church, deprive us of the hope, that as God once created the world out of nothing, so it is his proper work to bring forth the Church from the darkness of death.</p>  <a name="xi.vi"></a>

 <p><a name="xi.vi-p7"></a><b>19.</b> <i>For he hath looked down from the high place of his holiness</i> Now the prophet contemplates the deliverance after which he breathes with anxious desire, as if it had been already accomplished. That the malignity of men might not attempt to obscure such a signal blessing of Heaven, he 			 openly and in express terms claims for God his rightful praise; and the people were constrained in many ways to acknowledge therein the divine hand. Long before they were dragged into captivity, this calamity had been foretold, that when it took place the judgment of God might be clearly manifested; and at the same time deliverance had been promised them, and the time specified to be after the lapse of seventy years. The ingratitude of men therefore could not devise or invent any other cause to 			 which to ascribe their return but the mere goodness of God. Accordingly, it is said, that <i>God looked down from heaven, </i>that the Jews might not attribute to the grace and favor of Cyrus the deliverance which evidently proceeded from Heaven. <i>The high place of his holiness</i> or <i>sanctuary </i>is here equivalent to heaven. As the temple, in some parts of Scripture, (<a name="xi.vi-p7.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#008">Ps 26:8</a><a name="xi.vi-p7.1"></a> and <a name="xi.vi-p7.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa076.htm#002">Ps 76:2</a><a name="xi.vi-p7.2"></a>) is called “the habitation of God,” in respect of men, so, that we may not imagine that there is any thing earthly in God, he assigns to himself a dwelling-place in heaven, 			 not because he is shut up there, but that we may seek him above the world.</p>

 <p><a name="xi.vi-p9"></a><b>20.</b> <i>To hear the groaning of the prisoner</i> Here the prophet repeats once more what he had previously touched upon concerning prayer, in order again to stir up the hearts of the godly to engage in that exercise, and that after their deliverance they might know it to have been granted to their 			 faith, because, depending on the divine promises, they had sent up their groanings to heaven. He calls them <i>prisoners; </i>for although they were not bound in fetters, their captivity resembled a most rigorous imprisonment. Yea, he affirms a little after <i>that they were devoted to death, </i>to give them to understand that their life and safety would have been altogether hopeless, had they not been 			 delivered from death by the extraordinary power of God.</p>

 <p><a name="xi.vi-p11"></a><b>21</b>  <i>That the name of Jehovah may be declared in Zion</i> Here is celebrated a still more ample and richer fruit of this deliverance than has been previously mentioned, which is, that the Jews would not only be united into one body to give thanks to God, but that, 			 when brought back to their own country, they would also gather kings and nations into the same unity of faith, and into the same divine worship with themselves. At that time it was a thing altogether incredible, not only that the praises of God should within a short period resound, as in the days of old, in that temple which was burnt and completely overthrown,   			  <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">154</font></a>
  			  but also that the nations should resort thither from all quarters, and be associated together in the service of God with the Jews, who were then like a putrefied carcase. The prophet, to inspire the people with the hope of returning to their own land, argues that it was impossible that the place which God had chosen for himself should be left in perpetual desolation; and declares, that so far from this being the case there would be new matter for praising God, 			 inasmuch as His name would be worshipped by all nations, and the Church would consist not of one nation only, but of the whole world. This we know has been fulfilled under the administration of Christ, as was announced in prophecy by the holy patriarch,</p>  		  
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="xi.vi-p13"></a>“The scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet, until Shiloh come; and <i>unto him shall the gathering of the Gentiles be,</i>” (<a name="xi.vi-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#010">Ge 49:10</a><a name="xi.vi-p13.1"></a>.)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vi-p14"></a>But as the prophets are wont, in celebrating the deliverance from the Babylonish captivity, to extend it to the coming of Christ, the inspired bard in this place does not lay hold on merely a part of the subject, but carries forward the grace of God, even to its consummation. And although it was not necessary that all who were converted to Christ should go up to Jerusalem, yet following the manner of expression usual with the prophets, he has 			 laid down the observance of the divine worship which was appointed under the law, as a mark of true godliness. Farther, we may learn from this passage, that the name of God is never better celebrated than when true religion is extensively propagated, and when the Church increases, which on that account is called,</p>

 <p><a name="xi.vii-p8"></a><b>23.</b> <i>He hath afflicted my strength in the way</i> Some improperly restrict this complaint to the time when the Jews were subjected to much annoyance after the liberty granted them to return to their own land. We are rather to understand the word <i>journey </i>or <i>way</i> in a metaphorical sense. As the manifestation of Christ was the goal of the race which God’s ancient people were running, they justly complain that they are afflicted and weakened in the midst of their course.   			  <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">158</font></a>
  			  Thus they set before God his promise, telling him, that although they had not run at random, but had confided in his protection, they were nevertheless broken and crushed by his hand in the midst of their journey. They do not indeed find fault with him, as if he had disappointed their hope; but fully persuaded, that he does not deal deceitfully with those who serve him, by this complaint they strengthen themselves in the hope of a favorable issue. In the same sense 			 they add, that <i>their days were shortened, </i>because they directed their view to the fullness of time, which did not arrive till Christ was revealed.   			  <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">159</font></a>
  			  It accordingly follows, — (verse 24,) <i>Cut me not off in the midst of my days.</i> They compare the intervening period until Christ should appear to the middle of life; for, as has been already observed, the Church only attained to her perfect age at his coming. This calamity, no doubt, had been foretold, but the nature of the 			 covenant which God had entered into with his ancient people required that he should take them under his protection, and defend them. The captivity, therefore, was as it were a violent rupture, on which account the godly prayed with the greater confidence, that they might not be prematurely taken away in the midst of their journey. By speaking in this manner, they did not fix for themselves a certain term of life; but as God, in freely adopting them, had given them the commencement of life, with 			 the assurance that he would maintain them even to the advent of Christ, they might warrantably bring forward and plead this promise. Lord, as if they had said, thou hast promised us life, not for a few days, or for a month or for a few years, but until thou shouldst renew the whole world, and gather together all nations under the dominion of thine Anointed One.</p>

  			  The reason stated in the clause immediately following, <i>Thy years are from generation to generation, </i>seems to be quite inapplicable in the present case. Because God is everlasting, does it therefore follow that men will be everlasting too? But on <a name="xi.vii-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#002">Psalm 90:2</a><a name="xi.vii-p13.2"></a>, we have shown how we may with propriety bring forward his eternity, as a ground of confidence in reference to our salvation; for he desires to be known as eternal, not only in his mysterious and incomprehensible essence, but also in his word, according to the declaration of the Prophet Isaiah,</p>

 <p><a name="xi.vii-p15"></a>Now since God links us to himself by means of his word, however great the distance of our frail condition from his heavenly glory, our faith should nevertheless penetrate to that blessed state from which he looks down upon our miseries. Although the comparison between his eternal existence and the brief duration of human life is introduced also for another purpose, yet when he sees that men pass away as it were in a moment, and speedily 			 evanish, it moves him to compassion, as shall presently be declared at greater length.</p>

 <p><a name="xi.vii-p17"></a><b>25</b>  <i>Thou hast aforetime founded the earth</i> Here the sacred writer amplifies what he had previously stated, declaring, that compared with God the whole world is a form which quickly vanishes away; and yet a little after he represents the Church as exempted from 			 this the common lot of all sublunary things, because she has for her foundation the word of God, while her safety is secured by the same word. Two subjects are therefore here brought under our consideration. The first is, that since the heavens themselves are in the sight of God almost as evanescent as smoke, the frailty of the whole human race is such as may well excite his compassion; and the second is, that although there is no stability in the heavens and the earth, yet the Church shall 			 continue steadfast for ever, because she is upheld by the eternal truth of God. By the first of these positions, true believers are taught to consider with all humility, when they come into the divine presence, how frail and transitory their condition is, that they may bring nothing with them but their own emptiness. Such self-abasement is the first step to our obtaining favor in the sight of God, even as He also affirms that he is moved by the sight of our miseries to be merciful to us. The 			 comparison taken from the heavens is a very happy illustration; for how long have they continued to exist, when contrasted with the brief span of human life, which passes or rather flies away so swiftly? How many generations of men have passed away since the creation, while the heavens still continue as they were amidst this continual fluctuation? Again, so beautiful is their arrangement, and so excellent their frame-work, that the whole fabric proclaims itself to be the product of 			 <i>God’s hands</i>   			  <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">161</font></a>
  			  And yet neither the long period during which the heavens have existed, nor their fair embellishment, will exempt them from perishing. What then shall become of us poor mortals, who die when we are as yet scarcely born? for there is no part of our life which does not rapidly hasten to death.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p19"></a>Interpreters, however, do not all explain these words, <i>The heavens shall perish, </i>in the same way. Some understand them as expressing simply the change they shall undergo, which will be a species of destruction; for although they are not to be reduced to nothing, yet this change of their nature, as it may be termed, will destroy what is mortal and corruptible in them, so that 			 they shall become, in a manner, different and new heavens. Others explain the words conditionally, and make the supplement, “If it so please God,” regarding it as a thing absurd to say that the heavens are subject to corruption. But first, there is no necessity for introducing these supplementary words, which obscure the sense instead of making it plainer. In the next place, these expositors improperly attribute an immortal state to the heavens, of which Paul declares that they “groan and 			 travail in pain,” like the earth and the other creatures, until the day of redemption, (<a name="xi.vii-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#022">Ro 8:22</a><a name="xi.vii-p19.1"></a>) because they are subject to corruption; not indeed willingly, or in their own nature, but because man, by precipitating himself headlong into destruction, has drawn the whole world into a participation of the same ruin. Two things are to be here attended to; first, that the heavens are 			 actually subject to corruption in consequence of the fall of man; and, secondly, that they shall be so renewed as to warrant the prophet to say that <i>they shall perish; </i>for this renovation will be so complete that they shall not be the same but other heavens. The amount is, that to whatever quarter we turn our eyes, we will see everywhere nothing but ground for despair till we come 			 to God. What is there in us but rottenness and corruption? and what else are we but a mirror of death? Again, what are the changes which the whole world undergoes but a kind of presage, yea a prelude of destruction? If the whole frame-work of the world is hastening to its end, what will become of the human race? If all nations are doomed to perish, what stability will there be in men individually considered? We ought therefore to seek stability no where else but in God.</p>  		  
 <p class="Normal"><a name="xi.vii-p20"></a><a name="xi.vii-p20.1"></a></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p21"></a><b>28.</b> <i>The children of thy servants shall dwell</i>. By these words the prophet intimates that he does not ask the preservation of the Church, because it is a part of the human race, but because God has raised it above the revolutions of the world. And undoubtedly, when He adopted us as his children, his design was to 			 cherish us as it were in his own bosom. The inference of the inspired bard is not, therefore, far-fetched, when, amidst innumerable storms, each of which might carry us away, he hopes that the Church will have a permanent existence. It is true, that when through our own fault we become estranged from God, we are also as it were cut off from the fountain of life; but no sooner are we reconciled to Him than he begins again to pour down his blessings upon us. Whence it follows that true believers, 			 as they are regenerated by the incorruptible seed, shall continue to live after death, because God continues unchangeably the same. By the word <i>dwell, </i>is to be understood an abiding and everlasting inheritance.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xi.vii-p22"></a>When it is said that the seed of God’s servants shall be established <i>before his face, </i>the meaning is, that it is not after the manner of the world, or according to the way in which the heavens and the earth are established, that the salvation of true believers is made steadfast, but because of the holy union which exists between them and God. By <i>the seed</i> and<i> children</i> of the godly, is to be understood not all their descendants without exception — for many who spring from them according to the flesh become degenerate — but those who do not turn aside from the faith of their parents. Successive generations are expressly pointed 			 out, because the covenant extends even to future ages, as we shall again find in the subsequent psalm. If we firmly keep the treasure of life intrusted to us, let us not hesitate, although we may be environed with innumerable deaths, to cast the anchor of our faith in heaven, that the stability of our welfare may rest in God.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.ii-p6"></a> The pelican is a bird of the desert, to which frequent allusion is made by the sacred writers. Its Hebrew name <a name="xi.ii-p6.1"></a>קאת,<i> kaath</i>, literally means, <i>the vomiter</i>, being derived from the verb <a name="xi.ii-p6.2"></a>קוא, <i>ko</i>,<i> to vomit</i>  It has a large pouch, or bag, suspended from its bill and throat, which serves both as a repository for its food, and as a net for catching it. In feeding its 						young ones, whether this bag is loaded with water, or more solid food, it squeezes the contents of it into their mouths, by strongly compressing it upon its breast with its bill, an action which might well explain the origin of the name given to it by the Hebrews. It is a bird of solitary habits, and is said by Isidore to live “in the solitude of the river Nile:” indeed, it generally builds its nest in mossy, turfy places, in the islands of rivers or lakes, far from the abode of man. It is here 						described as living in the wilderness, a circumstance not inconsistent with its natural fondness for water; for lakes, as well as fountains, are to be found in the most desert parts. And although a water-fowl, it sometimes retires to a great distance from the water, where, in some remote and concealed situation, it may hatch its young with greater security. Its huge pouch, which is said to be capable of containing near the size of a man’s head, seems to be given to it for the purpose of its 						being provided with a supply of food for itself and its young ones when at a distance from the water. Bochart thinks that <a name="xi.ii-p6.3"></a>קאת, <i>kaath</i>, here means <i>the bittern</i>  His chief reason for this opinion 						is, that the Psalmist compares himself to the two birds specified, on account of his groaning, and that, therefore, both of them should have a mournful cry. But he finds that natural historians make no mention of this as a property of the pelican, whereas they all agree that the bittern, by inserting its bill in the mud of the marsh, or plunging it under water, utters a most disagreeable cry, like the roaring of a bull, or the sound of distant thunder. But the Psalmist may not so much compare 						his groaning to the plaintive cry of these birds, as compare his situation to their solitary condition. Sorrow, when pungent, drives the sufferer to solitude, and, on this occasion, the inspired bard, under the overwhelming pressure of grief, seems to have become weary of society, and, like the pelican, or the owl, to have contracted a relish for deep retirement. <i>Shaw</i>’<i>s Travels</i>, volume 2, page 302; <i>Paxton</i>’<i>s Illustrations of Scripture</i>, volume 2, pages 247-250.</p>

The proper translation, then, should be, not <i>the owl of the desert</i>, but <i>the owl of the desolate </i>or <i>ruined buildings</i>, which exactly corresponds with the habits of this bird; for such ruinous places, as is well known, are its ordinary haunt, where, in undisturbed solitude, it may utter its melancholy howlings. The allusion in Gray’s celebrated Elegy may illustrate the language of the text, —</p>  					 
 <p class="PoetryLast-DkBlu-11-Cent01"><a name="xi.ii-p8"></a>“Save that from yonder ivy mantled tower,<br> 						The moping owl does to the night complain,” etc.</p>  					 
 <p><a name="xi.ii-p9"></a>The habit of the owl in shunning the light of day, and delighting in solitude, well describes the sensitiveness with which the Psalmist, through the greatness of his grief, shrunk from society, and courted seclusion. Bochart contends that <a name="xi.ii-p9.1"></a>כוס here signifies, not <i>the owl</i>, but <i>the ostrich</i>, and, if the Psalmist is comparing himself to the two birds specified, on account of his groaning, this seems to favor that translation; for the female ostrich has a most dismal and mournful voice, very much resembling the lamentation of a human being in deep distress. But, as has been before observed, the Psalmist 						seems to refer, not so much to the mournful voice of these birds, as to their solitary condition.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.ii-p19"></a> Although Calvin expresses himself as having no doubt that the sparrow is here intended, the most eminent expositors are of a different opinion, contending that it is difficult to reconcile with the nature of the sparrow the ideas of <i>wakefulness </i>and <i>solitude </i>which the Psalmist represents as characteristic of the bird to which he compares himself. The sparrow is not a solitary moping bird which sits mournfully on the housetop, nor so 				  timid as to betake itself to the darkest corners for concealment, and to spend the live long night in sleepless anxiety. It is gregarious, is commonly found chirping and fluttering about in the crowd, a pert, loquacious, and bustling creature, and builds its nest in the habitations of men. Every part of the description leads to the supposition that some nocturnal bird is to be understood, which from instinct hates the light, and comes forth from its hiding-place only when the shadows of the 				  evening fall to hunt its prey, and from amidst the fragments, of some mouldering ruin to attract the attention of mankind by its mournful voice. Accordingly, it has been thought that the Psalmist refers to some species of the owl, distinguished for its plaintive cry and solitary disposition. — <i>Paxton</i>’<i>s Illustrations of Scripture</i>, volume 2, pages 355-357. “But,” says Merrick, “as <i>chos</i>, mentioned in the preceding verse, seems also to signify an<i> owl</i>,<i> 				  </i>we are perhaps to suppose two sorts of <i>owls</i> intended, one of which confines itself to deserts or ruinous places, and the other sometimes approaches cities or villages, and according to Virgil’s description, (which Bochart quotes as conformable to that of the Psalmist,) <i>sits</i> <i>alone on the house-top</i>.</p>  				
 <p class="Center"><a name="xi.ii-p20"></a><i>‘</i><a name="xi.ii-p20.1"></a>Solaque culminibus ferali carmine bubo Visa queri, et longas in fletum ducere voces.’<br> 				  <i>Æneid, </i>lib. 4. 50. 462.</p>  				
 <p><a name="xi.ii-p21"></a>I doubt whether the Psalmist would in two verses together compare his situation to that of the very same bird, with no other difference than that of its sitting in the desert in one verse, and on the house-top in the other.” Bochart thinks that the <i>screech-owl </i>is intended. The reason which Calvin assigns for the sparrow being called solitary, namely, because of the extreme sorrow which she feels when deprived of her mate, does not agree 				  with the natural history of that bird; for, unlike the turtle, who, on losing her spouse, remains in a state of inconsolable widowhood, she accepts without reluctance the first companion that solicits her affections.</p>

 <p><a name="xi.iii-p5"></a>“Houbigant,” says he, “rightly observes, that the verb <a name="xi.iii-p5.1"></a>נשבע, governing its objects by the prefix <a name="xi.iii-p5.2"></a>ב, signifies <i>to swear by</i>, not <i>to swear against</i>. For <a name="xi.iii-p5.3"></a>נשבעו, therefore, he would substitute another word; which, however, bears not the sense he would impose upon it. Archbishop Secker attempts to explain the text as it stands, but, in my judgment, unsuccessfully, unless <a name="xi.iii-p5.4"></a>נשבע may signify <i>to execrate </i>one’s self or another. I find no example of this use of the verb. But the [use] of the noun in <a name="xi.iii-p5.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#021">Nu 5:21</a><a name="xi.iii-p5.5"></a>, and <a name="xi.iii-p5.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015">Isa 65:15</a><a name="xi.iii-p5.6"></a>, may 						seem, in some degree, to countenance the Archbishop’s interpretation. The other passages to which he refers are little to the purpose.” Rosenmüller gives a similar interpretation. “<i>They</i> <i>swear by me</i>; they derive their arguments and examples from my calamities; when they mean to imprecate evil on 						themselves as the persons swearing, or on another as the object of their malediction, they use my name as a form of execration, as if they said, ‘Let our fate be that of these miserable Jews, if we speak what is false.’ — See <a name="xi.iii-p5.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#015">Isa 65:15</a><a name="xi.iii-p5.7"></a>; <a name="xi.iii-p5.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#022">Jer 29:22</a><a name="xi.iii-p5.8"></a>.”</p>

Accordingly, in the Chaldee, it is “the prayer of the desolate,” and in the Septuagint, “the prayer of the humble.” Houbigant derives the word from <a name="xi.v-p4.3"></a>רעע, <i>frangere</i>,<i> to break</i>, and renders it, “the afflicted.” Others read, “the destitute,” supposing the word to come from <a name="xi.v-p4.4"></a>ערה, <i>was naked</i>, as Fry: “‘When he hath turned himself to the prayer of the destitute’ — the people emptied, and poured forth — made bare or stripped naked.” Others prefer the version, “He regarded him when exciting his prayer,” as if the root of the Hebrew term were <a name="xi.v-p4.5"></a>עור, <i>to 						excite</i></p>

 <p><a name="xi.v-p7"></a>He regards the Psalm as a “prayer and lamentation of a believer, in the time of the last Antichristian persecution;” and after observing that the 16th and 17th verses are rendered by our English Bible in the future, he says, “These futures, in the original, are all present; ‘buildeth — appeareth — regardeth — and despiseth not.’ The Psalmist in his confidence of the event speaks of it as doing.”</p>

In this passage then, Christ, it would appear, is the person addressed; for if the apostle’s inspiration is admitted, the correctness of his interpretation of the Old Testament 						Scriptures cannot be doubted. Inappropriate applications of them, it is evident, would be inconsistent with his having spoken under the infallible guidance of the Spirit of God. And if these verses are applicable to the Savior of men, they contain an irrefragable proof of his essential divinity. He is called <i>Jehovah </i>throughout the psalm, a name peculiar to God only; the creation of all things is said to be performed by him, a work peculiar to God only; eternity and immutability are 						ascribed to him, attributes which in the strict and absolute sense belong exclusively to God.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="xi.vii-p9"></a><i> Way </i>or <i>journey </i>is a term often used in Scripture to denote the course of a man’s life; and here the Psalmist speaks, as other sacred writers not unfrequently do, of the whole Jewish nation as if it were one man, and of its continuance, which was to be until the coming of Christ, as if the life of one man. It was now, so to speak, only in its meridian. An attention to this remark will assist the reader in understanding Calvin’s 				  exposition of the passage.</p>
