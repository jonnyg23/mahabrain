 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p12"></a> </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.i-p13"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p13.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p14"></a><b>1.</b> <i>Fourteen years after.</i> This cannot with certainty be affirmed to be the same journey mentioned by Luke. (<a name="iii.iv.i-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002">Ac 15:2</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p14.1"></a>.) The connection of the history leads us rather to an opposite conclusion. We find that Paul performed four journeys to 		Jerusalem. Of the first we have already spoken. The second took place when, in company with Barnabas, he brought the charitable contributions of the Greek and Asiatic Churches. (<a name="iii.iv.i-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#025">Ac 15:25</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p14.2"></a>.) My belief that this second journey is referred to in the present passage rests on various grounds. On any other supposition, the statements of Paul and Luke cannot be reconciled. Besides, there is 		ground for conjecturing that the rebuke was administered to Peter at Antioch while Paul was residing there. Now, this happened before he was sent to Jerusalem by the Churches to settle the dispute which had arisen about ceremonial observances. (<a name="iii.iv.i-p14.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#002">Ac 15:2</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p14.3"></a>.) It is not reasonable to suppose that Peter would have used such dissimulation, if that controversy had been settled and the decree of 		the Apostles published. But Paul writes that he came to Jerusalem, and afterwards adds that he had rebuked Peter for an act of dissimulation, an act which Peter certainly would not have committed except in matters that were doubtful.   		 <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">38</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p16"></a>Besides, he would scarcely have alluded, at any time, to that journey  		 <a name="fr_38"></a><a href="#fn_38"><font size="1">39</font></a>
  		undertaken with the consent of all the believers, without mentioning the occasion of it, and the memorable decision which was passed. It is not even certain at what time the Epistle was written, only that the Greeks conjecture that it was sent from Rome, and the Latins from Ephesus. For my own part, I think that it was written, not only before Paul had seen Rome, but before that consultation had been held, and the decision of the Apostles given about ceremonial observances. While 		his opponents were falsely pleading the name of the apostles, and earnestly striving to ruin the reputation of Paul, what carelessness would it have angered in him to pass by the decree universally circulated among them, which struck at those very persons!  		 <a name="fr_39"></a><a href="#fn_39"><font size="1">40</font></a>
  		Undoubtedly, this one word would have shut their mouth: “You bring against me the authority of the apostles, but who does not know their decision? and therefore I hold you convicted of unblushing falsehood. In their name, you oblige the Gentiles to keep the law, but I appeal to their own writing, which sets the consciences of men at liberty.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p19"></a>We may likewise observe, that, in the commencement of the Epistle, he reproved the Galatians for having so soon revolted from the gospel which had been delivered to them. But we may readily conclude, that, after they had been brought to believe the gospel, some time must have elapsed before that dispute about the ceremonial law arose. I consider, therefore, that the fourteen years are to be reckoned, not from one journey to another, but 		from Paul’s conversion. The space of time between the two journeys was eleven years.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.i-p20"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p20.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p21"></a><b>2.</b> <i>And I went up according to revelation.</i>   		 <a name="fr_40"></a><a href="#fn_40"><font size="1">41</font></a>
  		 He now proceeds to prove his apostleship and his doctrine, not only by works, but also by a Divine revelation. Since God directed that journey, which had for its object the confirmation of his doctrine, the doctrine was confirmed, not by the concurrence of men only, but likewise by the authority of God. This ought to have been more than enough to overcome the obstinacy of those who blamed Paul by holding up the names of the apostles. For although, up to this time, 		there had been some room for debate, the communication of the mind of God put an end to all discussion.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p23"></a><i>I communicated to them.</i> The word <i>communicated</i> claims our first attention; for the apostles do not describe to him what he ought to teach, but, after listening to his own account of his doctrine, express their concurrence and approbation. But, as his opponents might allege that, by cunning dissimulation on many points, he 		had gained the favor of the apostles, he expressly states that he “communicated to them that doctrine which he preacheth among the Gentiles;” which removes all suspicion of hypocrisy or imposture. We shall see what followed; for the apostles did not take it amiss that he had not waited to obtain their sanction. On the contrary, without dispute or expostulation, they approved of his labors; and did so by the direction of the same Spirit, under whose guidance Paul had performed his journey to 		Jerusalem. Thus, he was not made an apostle by them, but acknowledged to be an apostle. But this point will be treated more fully afterwards.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p24"></a><i>Lest by any means.</i> What then? Shall the word of God fall, when it is unsupported by the testimony of men? Though the whole world were unbelieving, yet the word of God remains firm and unshaken: and they who preach the gospel by the command of God are not uselessly employed, even when no fruit is produced by their labors. This is not Paul’s meaning; but, as the consciences of men, so long as they 		doubt and hesitate, derive no benefit from the ministry of the word, so a preacher is said, so far as men is concerned, to <i>run in vain</i>, when his labors are ineffectual, and unaccompanied by proper edification.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p25"></a>It was, therefore, a formidable weapon for shaking weak consciences, when the doctrine which Paul preached was falsely declared by impostors to be at variance with the doctrine of the apostles. Multitudes in this manner fell away. The certainty of faith, indeed, does not depend on the agreement of human opinions; but, on the contrary, it is our duty to rest in the naked truth of God, so that neither men nor all the angels together, could 		shake our faith. Yet ignorant persons, who have imperfectly understood, and never have cordially embraced, sound doctrine, feel the temptation to be almost irresistible, while teachers of acknowledged eminence are found to entertain opposite views. Nay, strong believers are sometimes powerfully affected by this stratagem of Satan, when he holds out to their view the “strife and divisions” (<a name="iii.iv.i-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#003">1Co 3:3</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p25.1"></a>) of those who ought to have been</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.i-p26"></a>“perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment.” (<a name="iii.iv.i-p26.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#010">1Co 1:10</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p26.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p27"></a>It is hard to tell how many were driven from the gospel, how many had their faith shaken, by the mournful controversy about the bodily presence of Christ in the Lord’s Supper, because, on a question of the highest moment, very distinguished men were observed to take opposite sides.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p28"></a>On the other hand, the agreement of all who teach in the Church is a powerful aid for the confirmation of faith. Since, therefore, Satan was laboring so insidiously to hinder the progress of the gospel, Paul resolved to meet him. When he had succeeded in demonstrating that he held the same views with all the apostles, every hinderance was removed. Weak disciples were no longer perplexed by the inquiry, whom they ought to follow. His 		meaning may be thus summed up: “That my former labors might not be thrown away and rendered useless, I have set at rest the question which disturbed many minds, whether I or Peter deserved your confidence; for in all that I had ever taught we were perfectly at one.” If many teachers in our own day were as heartily desirous as Paul was to edify the Church, they would take more pains to be agreed among themselves.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.i-p29"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p29.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p30"></a><b>3.</b> <i>But neither Titus</i>. This is an additional argument to prove that the Apostles held the same views with himself; for he had brought to them an uncircumcised man, whom they did not hesitate to acknowledge as a brother. The reason is assigned why he was not circumcised; for circumcision, being a matter of indifference, might be neglected or 		practiced as edification required. Our invariable rule of action is, that, if “all things are lawful for us,” (<a name="iii.iv.i-p30.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#023">1Co 10:23</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p30.1"></a>) we ought to inquire what is expedient. He circumcises Timothy, (<a name="iii.iv.i-p30.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#003">Ac 16:3</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p30.2"></a>,) in order to take away a ground of offense from weak minds; for 		he was at that time dealing with weak minds, which it was his duty to treat with tenderness. And he would gladly have done the same thing with Titus, for he was unwearied in his endeavors to “support (<a name="iii.iv.i-p30.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act020.htm#035">Ac 20:35</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p30.3"></a>) the weak;” but the case was different. For some false brethren were watching for an opportunity of slandering his doctrine, and would immediately have spread the report: “See 		how the valiant champion of liberty, when he comes into the presence of the apostles, lays aside the bold and fierce aspect which he is wont to assume among the ignorant!” Now, as it is our duty to “bear the infirmities of the weak,” (<a name="iii.iv.i-p30.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#001">Ro 15:1</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p30.4"></a>,) so concealed foes, who purposely watch for our liberty, must, be vigorously resisted. The duties of love to our neighbor ought never to be 		injurious to faith; and therefore, in matters of indifference, the love of our neighbour will be our best guide, provided that faith shall always receive our first regard.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.i-p31"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p31.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p32"></a><b>4.</b> <i>And that because of false brethren</i>. This may mean either that false brethren made it the subject of wicked accusation, and endeavored to compel him; or that Paul purposely did not circumcise him, because he saw that they would immediately make it an occasion of slander. They had insinuated themselves into Paul’s company with the hope of gaining 		one of two objects. Either he would treat with open scorn the ceremonial law, and then they would rouse the indignation of the Jews against him; or he would refrain entirely from the exercise of his liberty, and in that case they would exult over him among the Gentiles as one who, overwhelmed with shame, had retracted his doctrine.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p33"></a>I prefer the second interpretation, that Paul, having discovered the snares laid for him, determined not to circumcise Titus. When he says that he was not “compelled,” the reader is led to understand that circumcision is not condemned as a bad thing in itself, but that the obligation to observe it was the subject of dispute. As if he had said, “I would have been prepared to circumcise Titus if higher matters had not been involved.” Their 		intention was to lay down a law; and to such compulsion he would not yield.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.i-p34"></a><a name="iii.iv.i-p34.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p35"></a><b>5</b><i>. To whom we gave place by subjection, no, not for an hour</i>. This steadiness was the seal of Paul’s doctrine. For when false brethren, who wished nothing more than a ground of accusation against him, exerted themselves to the utmost, and he stood firm, there could no longer be any room for doubt. It cannot now be insinuated that he deceived the apostles. He asserts that 		he did not for a moment <i>give place</i> to them <i>by subjection</i>, that is, by such a mode of yielding as would have implied that his liberty had been crushed. In every other respect, he was prepared, to the very close of his life, to exercise mildness and forbearance toward all men.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p36"></a><i>That the truth of the gospel</i>. There was no danger that Paul would be deprived of his liberty even by yielding to them; but the example would have done harm to others, and therefore he prudently inquired what was expedient. This shows us how far offenses must be avoided, and points us to edification as the object which ought to be kept in view in all matters of indifference. The amount, is this: 		“We are the servants of the brethren, but still keeping in view that we all serve the Lord, and that the liberty of our conscience shall remain unimpaired.” When false brethren wished to bring the saints in to bondage, it was their duty not to yield to them.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p37"></a><i>The truth of the gospel</i> denotes its genuine purity, or, which means the same thing, its pure and entire doctrine. For the false apostles did not altogether set aside the gospel, but mixed up with it their own notions, so as to give it a false and disguised aspect, which it always has when we make the smallest departure “from the simplicity that is in Christ.” (<a name="iii.iv.i-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2011.htm#003">2Co 11:3</a><a name="iii.iv.i-p37.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.i-p38"></a>With what effrontery then will the Papists boast that they possess the gospel, which is not only corrupted by many inventions, but more than adulterated by many wicked doctrines? Let us remember that it is not enough to retain the name of the gospel, and some kind of summary of its doctrines, if its solid purity do not remain untouched. Where are the men who, by pretended moderation, endeavor to bring about a reconciliation between us and 		the Papists? as if the doctrine of religion, like a matter affecting money or property, could be compromised. With what abhorrence would such a transaction have been regarded by Paul, who affirms that it is not the true gospel, if it is not pure!</p>  <a name="iii.iv.ii"></a>

  		 Paul is not yet satisfied, without making the Galatians understand that he had learned nothing from Peter and the apostles. Hence Porphyry and Julian   		 <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">43</font></a>
  		 accuse the holy man of pride, because he claims so much for himself that he cannot endure to learn anything from others; because he boasts of having become a teacher without any instruction or assistance; and because he labors so hard not to appear in an inferior character. But any one who will consider how necessary that boasting was, will acknowledge that it was holy boasting, and worthy of the highest praise; for, if he had yielded this point to his opponents, 		that he had profited under the apostles, he would have furnished them with two charges against him. They would immediately have said, “And so you made some progress; you corrected your past errors, and did not repeat your former rashness.” Thus, in the first place, the whole doctrine which he had hitherto taught would have fallen under suspicion; and, secondly, he would ever afterwards have possessed less authority, because he would have been reckoned but an ordinary disciple. We find, 		therefore, that it was not on his own account, but by the necessity under which he lay to establish the doctrine, that he was led to this holy boasting. The controversy has no reference to individuals, and therefore cannot be a struggle of ambition; but Paul’s determination was that no man, however eminent, should throw into the shade his apostleship, on which the authority of his doctrine depended. If this be not enough to silence those dogs, their barking is sufficiently answered.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p17"></a><i>Whatsoever they were</i>. These words must be read as a separate clause; for the parenthesis was intended to assure his opponents that he did not concern himself with the opinions of men. This passage has been variously interpreted. Ambrose thinks that it is a passing reference to the folly of attempting to lower Paul by holding up the apostles; and represents him as saying; “As if I were not 		equally at liberty to object that they were poor, illiterate men, while I, from my early years, enjoyed a liberal education under the care of Gamaliel. But I pass over all this, because I know that there is no respect of persons with God.” Chrysostom and Jerome take a harsher view of the words, as an indirect threatening of the most distinguished apostles. “Whatsoever they may be, if they swerve from duty, they shall not escape the judgment of God; neither the dignity of their office, nor the 		estimation of men, shall protect them.” But another interpretation appears to me more simple, and more agreeable to Paul’s design. He admits that they were first in the order of time, but contends that this did not prevent him from being their equal in rank. He does not say that it is of no consequence to him what they are at present; but he is speaking of a period now past, when they were already apostles, and when he was opposed to the faith of Christ. In short, he does not choose that what 		is past shall decide the matter; and refuses to admit the proverb, that he who comes first has the best right.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p18"></a><i>No man’s person</i>. Besides the interpretations which I have mentioned, a third is not unworthy of notice, — that in the government of the world distinctions of rank are admitted, but in the spiritual kingdom of Christ they can have no place. There is plausibility in the statement, but it is in reference to worldly government, that it is said,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p19"></a>“Ye shall not respect persons in judgment,.”<br> 		(<a name="iii.iv.ii-p19.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#017">De 1:17</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p19.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p20"></a>But I do not enter into that argument, for it does not affect this passage. Paul simply means, that the honorable rank which the apostles had attained did not prevent him from being called by God, and raised, all at once, from the lowest condition to be their equal. The difference between them, though great, is of no value in the sight of God, who does not accept persons, and whose calling is not influenced by any prejudices. But this 		view may likewise appear liable to objection; for, granting it to be true, and a truth which must be carefully maintained, that in our intercourse with God there is no respect of persons, how does this apply to Peter and his fellow-apostles, who were venerable, not merely for their rank, but for true holiness and spiritual gifts?</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p21"></a>The word <i>person</i> is contrasted with the fear of God and a good conscience; and this is its ordinary acceptation in Scripture. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#034">Acts 10:34</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#035">35</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p21.1"></a> <a name="iii.iv.ii-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#017">1Pe 1:17</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p21.2"></a>.) But piety, zeal, holiness, and other similar graces, were the principal grounds of the esteem and respect in which the apostles were held; while Paul speaks contemptuously of them, as if they had possessed nothing but the outward forms.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p22"></a>I reply: Paul is not discussing the real worth of the apostles, but the idle boasting of his adversaries. In order to support their own unfounded pretensions, they talked in lofty terms of Peter, and James, and John, and took advantage of the veneration with which they were regarded by the Church, for accomplishing their earnest desire of degrading Paul. His object is not to inquire what the apostles are, or what opinion must be formed 		respecting them when controversy is laid aside, but to tear off the disguises which the false apostles wore. As in a subsequent part of the Epistle he treats of circumcision, not in its real character, but in the false and impious notion attached to it by those impostors, so he now declares that the apostles were in the sight of God disguises, by which those persons attempted to shine in the world; and this is evident from the words. Why did they prefer them to Paul? because they were his 		predecessors in office. This was a mere disguise. In any other point of view, they would have been highly esteemed, and the gifts of God manifested in them would have been warmly admired by one so singularly modest as the apostle Paul, who elsewhere acknowledges that he was “the least of the apostles,” and unworthy to occupy so exalted a station.</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p23"></a>“I am the least of the apostles, and not worthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the Church of God.”<br> 		(<a name="iii.iv.ii-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009">1Co 15:9</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p23.2"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p24"></a><i>They communicated nothing to me.</i> It might also be rendered, “they communicated nothing with me;” for it is the same word which he formerly used twice.   		 <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">44</font></a>
  		 But the meaning is the same. When the apostles had heard Paul’s gospel, they did not on the other side bring forward their own, (as is commonly done when something better and more perfect is desired,) but were satisfied with his explanation, and simply and unhesitatingly embraced his doctrine, so that not even on the most doubtful point did a single word of debate pass between them. Nor are we to suppose that Paul, presuming on his superiority, took the lead in 		the discussion, and dictated to his brethren. On the contrary, his faith, about which unfavourable rumors had been spread, was fully explained by him, and sanctioned by their appropation.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p26"></a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p26.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p27"></a><b>7.</b> <i>But, on the contrary.</i> They immediately <i>gave him the right hand of fellowship</i>. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#009">Ga 2:9</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p27.1"></a>.) Consequently they gave their testimony to his doctrine, and without any exception; for 		they produced nothing on the other side, as is commonly done on debated points, but acknowledged that he held the same gospel in common with them, and was therefore entitled to the honors and rank of an associate. Now, one condition of this <i>fellowship</i> was, that they distributed the provinces among themselves. They were therefore equal, and there was no subjection on the part of Paul. To “give the right hands of fellowship” means here, to have a 		partnership settled by mutual agreement.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p28"></a><i>When they saw that the gospel of the uncircumcision was committed to me.</i> He asserts that he was not indebted to the apostles for the favor of being made an apostle by their consent and approbation, but that, in conceding to him the apostleship, they only refused to take away what God had given. He constantly urges that he was made an apostle by the gift and appointment of God, but adds here that 		he was acknowledged as such by the apostles themselves. Hence it followed, that those unprincipled men were attempting, what the apostles durst not have attempted, to oppose the election of God.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p29"></a>And here he begins to claim what belonged to himself in preference to others, the apostleship of the uncircumcision. For Paul and Barnabas differed from the rest in this respect, that they had been appointed to be apostles of the Gentiles. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#002">Ac 13:2</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p29.1"></a>.) That had been done by a Divine revelation, which the apostles not only did not oppose, but determined to 		ratify, because not to obey it, would have been impious. This shows us in what manner they arranged their respective duties, in compliance with a Divine revelation, namely, that Paul and Barnabas should be the apostles of the Gentiles, and that the others should be the apostles of the Jews.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p30"></a>But this appears to be at variance with the command of Christ, which enjoins that the twelve shall</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.ii-p31"></a>“go unto all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature.” (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#015">Mr 16:15</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p31.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p32"></a>I reply, that command was not intended to apply specifically to each individual, but describes in general terms the design of the apostolic office, which was, that salvation must be proclaimed to all nations by the doctrine of the gospel. For the apostles evidently did not travel over the whole world; nay, it is probable that not one of the twelve ever passed into Europe. What they allege about Peter may, for aught I know, be fabulous, 		and is, at all events, quite uncertain.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p33"></a>All of them, it will be objected, had still a commission both to Gentiles and to Jews. I own they had, as occasion offered. Each apostle, I grant, was entrusted with the publication of the gospel both among Gentiles and Jews; for the distribution was not of such a nature as to assign them fixed boundaries, like those of kingdoms, principalities, and provinces, which could not lawfully be passed. We see that Paul, wherever he went, 		uniformly offered his labors and services, in the first instance, to the Jews. As he had a right, while living among the Gentiles, to offer himself as an apostle and teacher to the Jews; so the others were at liberty, wherever they had it in their power, to bring Gentiles to Christ; and we find Peter exercising this privilege with regard to Cornelius and others. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p33.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act010.htm#001">Ac 10:1</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p33.1"></a>.) But as there were other apostles in 		that district, which was almost wholly inhabited by Jews, Paul traveled through Asia, Greece, and other distant parts, and on this occasion was specially ordained to be an apostle to the Gentiles. Nay, when the Lord first commanded him to be set apart, he directed him to leave Antioch and Syria, and perform voyages to distant countries for the sake of the Gentiles. On ordinary occasions, therefore, he was the apostle of the Gentiles, and on extraordinary occasions, he was the apostle of the 		Jews. The other apostles, again, took the Jews for their own department, but with the understanding that, when an opportunity occurred, they would be at liberty to direct their ministrations to the Gentiles; this last, however, being in their case an extraordinary service.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p34"></a>But if Peter’s apostleship had a peculiar reference to the Jews, let the Romanists see on what ground they derive from him their succession to the primacy. If the Pope of Rome claims the primacy because he is Peter’s successor, he ought to exercise it over the Jews. Paul is here declared to be the chief apostle of the Gentiles, yet they affirm that he was not bishop of Rome; and, therefore, if the Pope would establish 		any claim to his primacy, let him gather churches from among the Jews. He who by a decree of the Holy Spirit, and by the consent of the whole apostolic college, has been solemnly declared to be one of the apostles, cannot but be acknowledged by us in that character. Those who would transfer that right to Peter set aside all ordination, both human and divine. It is unnecessary to explain here the well-known metaphor in the words <i>circumcision</i> and 		<i>uncircumcision</i>, as applied to Jews and Gentiles.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p36"></a><b>8.</b><i> He that wrought effectually</i>. That the province which had been assigned to him was truly his own, is proved by the exertion of divine power during his ministry. Now, this manifestation of divine energy, as we have frequently seen, is the seal by which his doctrine was attested, and his office as a teacher sanctioned. Whether Paul refers God’s <i>effectual working</i> to the success of his preaching, or to the graces of the Holy Spirit which were then bestowed on believers, is doubtful. I do not understand it as denoting the mere success, but the spiritual power and efficacy,   		 <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">45</font></a>
  		 which he has elsewhere mentioned. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p37.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1002.htm#004">1Co 2:4</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p37.2"></a>.) The amount of the whole is, that it was no idle bargain which the apostles had made among themselves, but a decision which God had sealed.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p39"></a><b>9.</b> <i>And when they perceived the grace. </i>They who treated with contempt the grace of God, by which the most eminent apostles had been led to admire and reverence Paul, are charged with hateful and proud disdain. If they should allege that they were ignorant of that which the apostles knew from the beginning, the hypocritical pretense was not to be 		endured. This admonishes us to yield to the grace of God, wherever it is perceived, unless we choose to contend with the Holy Spirit, whose will it is that his gifts shall not remain unemployed. The grace which the apostles perceived to have been given to Paul and Barnabas, induced them to sanction their ministry by receiving them as their associates.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.ii-p40"></a><i>James and Cephas</i>. I have already stated, that James was the son of Alpheus. He could not be “the brother of John” who had been lately put to death by Herod, (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p40.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act012.htm#002">Ac 12:2</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p40.1"></a>,) and to suppose that one of the disciples had been placed above the apostles would be absurd. That he held the highest 		rank among the apostles, is made evident by Luke, who ascribes to him the summing up and decision of the cause in the council, (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p40.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#013">Ac 15:13</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p40.2"></a>,) and afterwards mentions his having assembled “all the elders” of the church of Jerusalem. (<a name="iii.iv.ii-p40.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act021.htm#018">Ac 21:18</a><a name="iii.iv.ii-p40.3"></a>.) When he says, that they 		<i>seemed to be pillars</i>, he does not speak contemptuously, but quotes the general opinion, arguing from it, that what was done by such men ought not to be lightly set aside. In a question relating to diversity of rank, it is surprising that James should be mentioned before Peter; but the reason perhaps is, that he presided over the church at Jerusalem. As to the word <i>pillar</i>, we know that, from the 		nature of things, those who excel in ability, prudence, or other gifts, possess greater authority. And even in the Church of God, he who enjoys a larger measure of grace ought, on that account, to receive the higher honor. It argues ingratitude, nay impiety, not to worship the Spirit of God wherever he appears in his gifts; and as a people cannot want a pastor, so the assemblies of pastors require a moderator.

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p16"></a><b>11.</b> <i>When Peter was come</i>. Whoever will carefully examine all the circumstances, will, I trust, agree with me in thinking, that this happened before the apostles had decided that the Gentiles should receive no annoyance about ceremonial observances. (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act015.htm#028">Ac 15:28</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p16.1"></a>.) For Peter would have entertained no dread of offending James, or those sent by him, after that decision had been passed: but such was the dissimulation of Peter, that, in opposing it, Paul was driven to assert “the truth of the gospel.” At first he said, that the certainty of his gospel does not in any degree depend on Peter and the apostles, so as to stand or fall by their judgment. Secondly, he said, that it had been approved by all without any exception 		or contradiction, and particularly by those who were universally admitted to hold the highest place. Now, as I have said, he goes further, and asserts that he had blamed Peter for leaning to the other side; and he proceeds to explain the cause of the dispute. It was no ordinary proof of the strength of his doctrine, that he not only obtained their cordial approbation, but firmly maintained it in a debate with Peter, and came off victorious. What reason could there now be for hesitating to 		receive it as certain and undoubted truth?</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p17"></a>At the same time, this is a reply to another calumny, that Paul was but an ordinary disciple, far below the rank of an apostle: for the reproof which he administered was an evidence that the parties were on an equal footing. The highest, I acknowledge, are sometimes properly reproved by the lowest, for this liberty on the part of inferiors towards their superiors is permitted by God; and so it does not follow, that he who reproves 		another must be his equal. But the nature of the reproof deserves notice. Paul did not simply reprove Peter, as a Christian might reprove a Christian, but he did it officially, as the phrase is; that is, in the exercise of the apostolic character which he sustained.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p18"></a>This is another thunderbolt which strikes the Papacy of Rome. It exposes the impudent pretensions of the Roman Antichrist, who boasts that he is not bound to assign a reason, and sets at defiance the judgment of the whole Church. Without rashness, without undue boldness, but in the exercise of the power granted him by God, this single individual chastises Peter, in the presence of the whole Church; and Peter submissively bows to the 		chastisement. Nay, the whole debate on those two points was nothing less than a manifest overthrow of that tyrannical primacy, which the Romanists foolishly enough allege to be founded on divine right. If they wish to have God appearing on their side, a new Bible must be manufactured; if they do not wish to have him for an open enemy, those two chapters of the Holy Scriptures must be expunged.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p19"></a><i>Because he was worthy of blame.</i> The Greek participle, κατεγνωσμένος, signifies Blamed, so that the words run, “because he was blamed;” but I have no doubt whatever, that the word was intended to express, “one who deserves just blame.” Chrysostom makes the meaning to be, that others had previously indulged in complaint and accusation; but this is 		really trifling. It was customary with the Greeks to give to their participles the signification of nouns, which, every person must see, is applicable to this passage. This will enable us to perceive the absurdity of the interpretation given by Jerome and Chrysostom, who represent the whole transaction as a feigned debate, which the apostles had previously arranged to take place in presence of the people. They are not even supported by the phrase, “I withstood him<i> to 		the face</i>, κατὰ πρόσωπον, which means that “to the face,” or “being present,” Peter was chastised and struck dumb. The observation of Chrysostom, that, for the sake of avoiding scandal, they would have talked in private if they had any difference, is frivolous. The less important must be disregarded in comparison of the most dangerous of all scandals, that the Church would be rent, that Christian liberty was in danger, 		that the doctrine of the grace of Christ was overthrown; and therefore this public offense must be publicly corrected.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p20"></a>The chief argument on which Jerome rests is excessively trifling. “Why should Paul,” says he, “condemn in another what he takes praise for in himself? for he boasts that ‘to the Jews he became as a Jew.’” (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#020">1Co 9:20</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p20.1"></a>.) I reply, that what Peter did is totally different. Paul accommodated himself to the Jews no farther than was 		consistent with the doctrine of liberty; and therefore he refused to circumcise Titus, that the truth of the gospel might remain unimpaired. But Peter Judaized in such a manner as to “compel the Gentiles” to suffer bondage, and at the same time to create a prejudice against Paul’s doctrine. He did not, therefore, observe the proper limit; for he was more desirous to please than to edify, and more solicitous to inquire what would gratify the Jews than what would be expedient for the whole body. 		Augustine is therefore right in asserting, that this was no previously arranged plan, but that Paul, out of Christian zeal, opposed the sinful and unseasonable dissimulation of Peter, because he saw that it would be injurious to the Church.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p22"></a><b>12.</b> <i>For before that certain persons came.</i> The state of the case is here laid down. For the sake of the Jews, Peter had withdrawn himself from the Gentiles, in order to drive them from the communion of the Church, unless they would relinquish the liberty of the Gospel, and submit to the yoke of the Law. If Paul had been silent here, his whole 		doctrine fell; all the edification obtained by his ministry was ruined. It was therefore necessary that he should rise manfully, and fight with courage. This shews us how cautiously we ought to guard against giving way to the opinions of men, lest an immoderate desire to please, or an undue dread of giving offense, should turn us aside from the right path. If this might happen to Peter, how much more easily may it happen to us, if we are not duly careful!</p>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p24"></a><b>14.</b> <i>But when I saw that they walked not uprightly</i>. Some apply these words to the Gentiles, who, perplexed by Peter’s example, were beginning to give way; but it is more natural to understand them as referring to Peter and Barnabas, and their followers. The proper road to the truth of the gospel was, to unite the Gentiles with the Jews in such a 		manner that the true doctrine should not be injured. But to bind the consciences of godly men by an obligation to keep the law, and to bury in silence the doctrine of liberty, was to purchase unity at an exorbitant price.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p25"></a><i>The truth of the gospel</i> is here used, by Paul, in the same sense as before, and is contrasted with those disguises by which Peter and others concealed its beauty. In such a case, the struggle which Paul had to maintain must unquestionably have been serious. They were perfectly agreed about doctrine;   		 <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">46</font></a>
  		 but since, laying doctrine out of view, Peter yielded too submissively to the Jews, he is accused of halting. There are some who apologize for Peter on another ground, because, being the apostle of the circumcision, he was bound to take a particular concern in the salvation of the Jews; while they at the same time admit that Paul did right in pleading the cause of the Gentiles. But it is foolish to defend what the Holy Spirit by the mouth of Paul has condemned. 		This was no affair of men, but involved the purity of the gospel, which was in danger of being contaminated by Jewish leaven.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p27"></a><i>Before them all</i>. This example instructs us, that those who have sinned publicly must be publicly chastised, so far as concerns the Church. The intention is, that their sin may not, by remaining unpunished, form a dangerous example; and Paul elsewhere (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#020">1Ti 5:20</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p27.1"></a>) lays down 		this rule expressly, to be observed in the case of elders,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.iii-p28"></a>“Them that sin rebuke before all, that others also may fear;”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p29"></a>because the station which they hold renders their example more pernicious. It was particularly advantageous, that the good cause, in which all had an interest, should be openly defended in presence of the people, that Paul might have a better opportunity of shewing that he did not shrink from the broad light of day.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p30"></a><i>If thou, being a Jew</i>. Paul’s address to Peter consists of two parts. In the first, he expostulates with him for his injustice toward the Gentiles, in compelling them to keep the law, from the obligations of which he wished himself to be exempted. For, not to mention that every man is bound to keep the law which he lays down for others, his conduct was greatly aggravated by compelling the 		Gentiles to observe Jewish ceremonies, while he, being a Jew, left himself at liberty. The law was given to Jews, not to Gentiles; so that he argues from the less to the greater.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p31"></a>Next, it is argued, that, in a harsh and violent manner, he <i>compelled the Gentiles</i>, by withdrawing from their communion, unless they chose to submit to the yoke of the law; and thus imposed on them an unjust condition. And, indeed, the whole force of the reproof lies in this word, which neither Chrysostom nor Jerome has remarked. The use of ceremonies was free for the 		purposes of edification, provided that believers were not deprived of their liberty, or laid under any restraint from which the gospel sets them free.</p>

Some, I am aware, think that this is stated in the form of an objection, (ἀνθυποφορὰ,) anticipating what might be urged on the other side, that the Jews possessed higher privileges; not that they would boast of exemption from the law, (for it would have been highly 		absurd, that they to whom the Law was given should make this their boast,) but that there was a propriety in retaining some points of distinction between them and the Gentiles. I do not entirely reject, and yet, as will afterwards appear, I do not altogether adopt this view. Some, again, consider that it is Paul himself who uses this argument, “If you were to lay upon the Jews the burden of the law, it would be more reasonable, because it is theirs by inheritance.” But neither do I approve of 		this view.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p34"></a>He is now proceeding to the second part of his speech, which commences with an anticipation. The Gentiles differed from them in this respect, that they were “unholy and profane,” (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p34.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1001.htm#009">1Ti 1:9</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p34.1"></a>;) while the Jews, being holy, so far as God had chosen them for his people, might contend for this superiority. Skilfully anticipating the objection, Paul 		turns it to the opposite conclusion. Since the Jews themselves, with all their advantages, were forced to betake themselves to the faith of Christ, how much more necessary was it that the Gentiles should look for salvation through faith? Paul’s meaning therefore is: “We, who appear to excel others, — we, who, by means of the covenant, have always enjoyed the privilege of being nigh to God, (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p34.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#007">De 4:7</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p34.2"></a>,) have found no method of obtaining salvation, but by believing in Christ: why, then, should we prescribe another method to the Gentiles? For, if the law were necessary or advantageous for salvation to those who observed its enactments, it must have been most of all advantageous to us to whom it was given; but if we relinquished it, and betook ourselves to Christ, much less ought compliance with it to be urged upon the Gentiles.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p35"></a>The word <i>sinner</i>, signifies here, as in many other places, a “profane person,” (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p35.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#016">Heb 12:16</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p35.1"></a>,) or one who is lost and alienated from God. Such were the Gentiles, who had no intercourse with God; while the Jews were, by adoption, the children of God, and 		therefore set apart to holiness. <i>By nature</i>, does not mean that they were naturally free from the corruption of the human race; for David, who was a descendant of Abraham, acknowledges,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.iii-p36"></a>“Behold, I was shapen in iniquity,<br> 		and in sin did my mother conceive me,” (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p36.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa051.htm#005">Ps 51:5</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p36.2"></a>,)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p37"></a>but the corruption of nature, to which they were liable, had been met by the remedy of sanctifying grace. Now, as the promise made the blessing hereditary, so this benefit is called natural; just as, in the Epistle to the Romans, he says, that they were sprung from a “holy root.” (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom011.htm#016">Ro 11:16</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p37.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p38"></a>When he says, <i>we are Jews by nature,</i> his meaning is, “We are born holy: not certainly by our own merit, but because God hath chosen us to be his people.” Well, then, we who were by nature Jews, what have we done? “We have believed in Jesus Christ.” What was the design of our believing? “That we might be justified by the faith of Christ.” For what reason? Because we 		“know that a man is not justified by the works of the law.” From the nature and effect of faith, he reasons that the Jews are in no degree justified by the law. For, as they who</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.iii-p39"></a>“go about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God,” (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p39.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom010.htm#003">Ro 10:3</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p39.1"></a>,)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p40"></a>so, on the contrary, they who believe in Christ, confess that they are sinners, and renounce justification by works. This involves the main question, or rather, in this single proposition nearly the whole controversy is embodied. It is the more necessary to bestow some care on the examination of this passage.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p41"></a>The first thing to be noticed is, that we must seek justification by the faith of Christ, because we cannot be justified by works. Now, the question is, what is meant by <i>the works of the law</i>? The Papists, misled by Origen and Jerome, are of opinion, and lay it down as certain, that the dispute relates to shadows; and accordingly assert, that by “the works of the law” 		are meant ceremonies. As if Paul were not reasoning about the free justification which is bestowed on us by Christ. For they see no absurdity in maintaining that “no man is justified by the works of the law,” and yet that, by the merit of works, we are accounted righteous in the sight of God. In short, they hold that no mention is here made of the works of the moral law. But the context clearly proves that the moral law is also comprehended in these words; for almost everything which Paul 		afterwards advances belongs more properly to the moral than to the ceremonial law; and he is continually employed in contrasting the righteousness of the law with the free acceptance which God is pleased to bestow.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p42"></a>It is objected by our opponents, that the term “works” must have been employed without any addition, if Paul had not intended to limit it to a particular class. But I reply, there is the best of all reasons for this mode of expression; for, though a man were to excel all the angels in holiness, no reward is due to works, but on the footing of a Divine promise. Perfect obedience to the law is righteousness, and has a promise of eternal 		life annexed to it; but it derives this character from God, who declares that “they who have fulfilled them shall live.” (<a name="iii.iv.iii-p42.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev018.htm#005">Le 18:5</a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p42.1"></a>.) On this point we shall afterwards treat more fully in its own place.  		 <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">47</font></a>
  		Besides, the controversy with the Jews was about the law. Paul, therefore, chose rather to bring the matter to an issue, by meeting them at once on their own ground, than to adopt a more circuitous route, which might wear the aspect of evading the subject, or distrusting his cause. Accordingly he resolves to have a close debate about the law.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p44"></a>Their second objection is, that the whole question raised was about ceremonies, which we readily allow. Why then, say they, would the apostle pass suddenly from a particular department to the whole subject? This was the sole cause of the mistake into which Origen and Jerome were betrayed; for they did not think it natural that, while the false apostles were contending about ceremonies alone, Paul should take in a larger field. But they 		did not consider that the very reason for disputing so keenly was, that the doctrine led to more serious consequences than at first view appeared. It would not have given so much uneasiness to Paul that ceremonies should be observed, as that the confident hope and the glory of salvation should be made to rest on works; just as, in the dispute about forbidding flesh on certain days, we do not look so much to the importance of the prohibition itself, as to the snare which is laid for the 		consciences of men. Paul, therefore, does not wander from the subject, when he enters into a controversy about the whole law, although the arguments of the false apostles were confined wholly to ceremonies. Their object in pressing ceremonies was, that men might seek salvation by obedience to the law, which, they falsely maintained, was meritorious; and accordingly, Paul meets them, not with the moral law, but with the grace of Christ alone. And yet this extended discussion does not occupy the 		whole of the Epistle; he comes at length to the specific question of ceremonies: but as the most serious difficulty was, whether justification is to be obtained by works or by faith, it was proper that this should be first settled. As the Papists of the present day are uneasy when we extort from them the acknowledgment that men are justified by faith alone, they reluctantly admit that “the works of the law” include those of a moral nature. Many of them, however, by quoting Jerome’s gloss, 		imagine that they have made a good defense; but the context will show that the words relate also to the moral law.  		 <a name="fr_47"></a><a href="#fn_47"><font size="1">48</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.iii-p46"></a><a name="iii.iv.iii-p46.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p47"></a><b>16.</b> <i>But by the faith of Jesus Christ</i>. He does not merely state that ceremonies, or works of any kind, are insufficient without the assistance of faith, but meets their denial by a statement admitting of no exception, as if he had said, “Not by works, but by the Gift of Christ alone.” In any other point of view, the sentiment would have been 		trivial and foreign to the purpose; for the false apostles did not reject Christ nor faith, but demanded that ceremonies should be joined with them. If Paul had admitted this claim, they would have been perfectly at one, and he would have been under no necessity to agitate the church by this unpleasant debate. Let it therefore remain settled, that the proposition is so framed as to admit of no exception, “that we are justified in no other way than by faith,” or, “that we are not justified but 		by faith,” or, which amounts to the same thing, “that we are justified by faith alone.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p48"></a>Hence it appears with what silly trifling the Papists of our day dispute with us about the word, as if it had been a word of our contrivance. But Paul was unacquainted with the theology of the Papists, who declare that a man is justified by faith, and yet make a part of justification to consist in works. Of such half-justification Paul knew nothing. For, when he instructs us that we are justified by faith, because we cannot be justified 		by works, he takes for granted what is true, that we cannot be justified through the righteousness of Christ, unless we are poor and destitute of a righteousness of our own.  		 <a name="fr_48"></a><a href="#fn_48"><font size="1">49</font></a>
  		Consequently, either nothing or all must be ascribed to faith or to works. As to the word justification, and the manner in which faith is the cause of it, we shall afterwards see.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iii-p50"></a><i>By the works of the law shall no flesh be justified</i>. He had already appealed to the consciences of Peter and others, and now confirms it more fully by affirming that such is the actual truth, that by the works of the law no mortal will obtain justification. This is the foundation of a freely bestowed righteousness, when we are stripped of a righteousness of our own. Besides, when he asserts 		that no mortal is justified by the righteousness of the law, the assertion amounts to this, that from such a mode of justification all mortals are excluded, and that none can possibly reach it.</p>  <a name="iii.iv.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p14"></a><b>17.</b><i> If, while we seek to be justified</i>. He now returns to the Galatians. We must take care not to connect this verse with the preceding one, as if it were a part of the speech addressed to Peter: for what had Peter to do with this argument? It certainly has very little, if anything, to do with the speech; but let every one form his own opinion.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p15"></a>Chrysostom, and some other commentators, make the whole passage to be an affirmation, and interpret it thus: “If, while we seek to be justified by Christ, we are not yet perfectly righteous, but still unholy, and if, consequently, Christ is not sufficient for our righteousness, it follows that Christ is the minister of the doctrine which leaves men in sin:” supposing that, by this absurd proposition, Paul insinuates a charge of blasphemy 		against those who attribute a part of justification to the law. But as the expression of indignant abhorrence immediately follows, which Paul is never accustomed to employ but in answer to questions, I am rather inclined to think that the statement is made for the purpose of setting aside an absurd conclusion which his doctrine appeared to warrant. He puts a question, in his usual manner, into the mouth of his antagonists. “If, in consequence of the righteousness of faith, we, who are Jews and 		were ‘sanctified from the womb,’ (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#005">Jer 1:5</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p15.1"></a> <a name="iii.iv.iv-p15.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#015">Ga 1:15</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p15.2"></a>,) are reckoned guilty and polluted, shall we say that Christ makes sin to be powerful in his own people, and that he is therefore the author of sin?”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p16"></a>This suspicion arose from his having said that Jews, by believing in Christ, renounce the righteousness of the law; for, while they are still at a distance from Christ, Jews, separated from the ordinary pollution of the Gentiles, appear to be in some respects exempted from the appellation of sinners. The grace of Christ places them on a level with the Gentiles; and the remedy, which is common to both, shews that both 		had labored under the same disease. This is the force of the particle also, — <i>we ourselves also</i>, — meaning not any description of men, but the Jews, who stood highest.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p17"></a><i>Far from it.</i> He properly rejects that inference. Christ, who discovers the sin which lay concealed, is not therefore the minister of sin; as if, by depriving us of righteousness, he opened the gate to sin, or strengthened its dominion.   		 <a name="fr_49"></a><a href="#fn_49"><font size="1">50</font></a>
  		 The Jews were mistaken in claiming any holiness for themselves apart from Christ, while they had none. Hence arose the complaint: “Did Christ come to take from us the righteousness of the law, to change saints into polluted men, to subject us to sin and guilt?” Paul denies it, and repels the blasphemy with abhorrence. Christ did not bring sin, but unveiled it; he did not take away righteousness, but stripped the Jews of a false disguise.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p19"></a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p19.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p20"></a><b>18.</b><i> For if I build again</i>. The reply consists of two parts. This is the first part, and informs us that the supposition now made is at variance with his whole doctrine, since he had preached the faith of Christ in such a manner as to connect with it the ruin and destruction of sin. For, as we are taught by John, that Christ came not to build up the kingdom of sin, but 		“that he might destroy the works of the devil,” (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#008">1Jo 3:8</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p20.1"></a>,) so Paul declares, that, in preaching the gospel, he had restoreth true righteousness, in order that sin might be destroyed. It was, therefore, in the highest degree improbable, that the same person who destroyed sin should renew its power; and, by stating the absurdity, he repels the calumny.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p21"></a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p21.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p22"></a><b>19.</b> <i>For I through the law</i>. Now follows the direct reply, that we must not ascribe to Christ that work which properly belongs to the law. It was not necessary that Christ should destroy the righteousness of the law, for the law itself slays its disciples. As if he had said, “You deceive wretched men by the false notion, that they must live by the 		law; and, under that pretext, you keep them in the law. And yet you bring it as a charge against the Gospel, that it annihilates the righteousness which we have by the law. But it is the law which forces us to die to itself; for it threatens our destruction, leaves us nothing but despair, and thus drives us away from trusting to the law.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p23"></a>This passage will be better understood by comparing it with <a name="iii.iv.iv-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#000">Ro 7</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p23.1"></a>. There Paul describes beautifully, that no man lives to the law, but he to whom the law is dead, that is, has lost all power and efficacy; for, as soon as the law begins to live in us, it inflicts a fatal wound by which we die, and at the same time 		breathes life into the man who is already dead to sin. Those who live to the law, therefore, have never felt the power of the law, or properly understood what the law means; for the law, when truly perceived, makes us die to itself, and it is from this source, and not from Christ, that sin proceeds.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p24"></a><i>To die to the law,</i> may either mean that we renounce it, and are delivered from its dominion, so that we have no confidence in it, and, on the other hand, that it does not hold us captives under the yoke of slavery; or it may mean, that, as it allures us all to destruction, we find in it no life. The latter view appears to be preferable. It is not to Christ, he tells us, that it is owing that the 		law is more hurtful than beneficial; but the law carries within itself the curse which slays us. Hence it follows, that the death which is brought on by the law is truly deadly. With this is contrasted another kind of death, in the life-giving fellowship of the cross of Christ. He says, that he is crucified together with Christ, that he might live unto God. The ordinary punctuation of this passage obscures the true meaning. It is this: “I through the law am dead to the law, that I might live to 		God.” But the context will read more smoothly thus: “I through the law am dead to the law;” then, in a separate sentence, “That I might live to God, I am crucified with Christ.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p25"></a><i>That I might live to God</i>. He shews that the kind of death, on which the false apostles seized as a ground of quarrel, is a proper object of desire; for he declares that we are dead to the law, not by any means that we may live to sin, but that we may live to God. <i>To live to God,</i> sometimes means to regulate our life according to his will, so as to 		study nothing else in our whole life but to gain his approbation; but here it means to live, if we may be allowed the expression, the life of God. In this way the various points of the contrast are preserved; for in whatever sense we are said to die to sin, in the same sense do we live to God. In short, Paul informs us that this death is not mortal, but is the cause of a better life; because God snatches us from the shipwreck of the law, and by his grace raises us up to another life. I say 		nothing of other interpretations; but this appears to be the apostle’s real meaning.</p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p26"></a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p26.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p27"></a><b>20. </b><i>I am crucified with Christ</i>. This explains the manner in which we, who are dead to the law, live to God. Ingrafted into the death of Christ, we derive from it a secret energy, as the twig does from the root. Again, the handwriting of the law,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p28"></a>“which was contrary to us, Christ has nailed to his cross.” (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p28.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col002.htm#014">Col 2:14</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p28.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p29"></a>Being then crucified with him, we are freed from all the curse and guilt of the law. He who endeavors to set aside that deliverance makes void the cross of Christ. But let us remember, that we are delivered from the yoke of the law, only by becoming one with Christ, as the twig draws its sap from the root, only by growing into one nature.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p30"></a><i>Nevertheless I live</i>. To the feelings of man, the word Death is always unpleasant. Having said that we are “crucified with Christ,” he therefore adds, “that this makes us alive.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p31"></a><i>Yet not I, but Christ liveth in me</i>. This explains what he meant by “living to God.” He does not live by his own life, but is animated by the secret power of Christ; so that Christ may be said to live and grow in him; for, as the soul enlivens the body, so Christ imparts life to his members. It is a remarkable sentiment, that believers live out of themselves, that is, they live in Christ; which 		can only be accomplished by holding real and actual communication with him. Christ lives in us in two ways. The one life consists in governing us by his Spirit, and directing all our actions; the other, in making us partakers of his righteousness; so that, while we can do nothing of ourselves, we are accepted in the sight of God. The first relates to regeneration, the second to justification by free grace. This passage may be understood in the latter sense; but if it is thought better to apply 		it to both, I will cheerfully adopt that view.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p32"></a><i>And the life which I now live in the flesh</i>. There is hardly a sentence here which has not been torn by a variety of interpretations. Some understand by the word <i>flesh</i>, the depravity of sinful nature; but Paul means by it simply the bodily life, and it is to this that the objection applies. “You live a bodily life; but while this corruptible body 		performs its functions, — while it is supported by eating and drinking, this is not the heavenly life of Christ. It is therefore an unreasonable paradox to assert, that, while you are openly living after the ordinary manner of men, your life is not your own.”</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p33"></a>Paul replies, that it consists in faith; which intimates that it is a secret hidden from the senses of man. The life, therefore, which we attain by faith is not visible to the bodily eye, but is inwardly perceived in the conscience by the power of the Spirit; so that the bodily life does not prevent us from enjoying, by faith, a heavenly life.</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p34"></a>“He hath made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus.” (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p34.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#006">Eph 2:6</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p34.1"></a>.)</p>

 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p39"></a>Paul’s writings are full of similar assertions, that, while we live in the world, we at the same time live in heaven; not only because our Head is there, but because, in virtue of union, we enjoy a life in common with him. (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p39.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#023">Joh 14:23</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p39.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p40"></a><i>Who loved me</i>. This is added to express the power of faith; for it would immediately occur to any one, — whence does faith derive such power as to convey into our souls the life of Christ? He accordingly informs us, that the love of Christ, and his death, are the objects on which faith rests; for it is in this manner that the effect of faith must be judged. How comes it that we live by the faith 		of Christ? Because “he loved us, and gave himself for us.” The love of Christ led him to unite himself to us, and he completed the union by his death. By giving himself for us, he suffered in our own person; as, on the other hand, faith makes us partakers of every thing which it finds in Christ. The mention of love is in accordance with the saying of the apostle John,</p>  	 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p41"></a>“Not that we loved God, but he anticipated us by his love.”<br> 		(<a name="iii.iv.iv-p41.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1004.htm#010">1Jo 4:10</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p41.2"></a>)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p42"></a>For if any merit of ours had moved him to redeem us, this reason would have been stated; but now Paul ascribes the whole to love: it is therefore of free grace. Let us observe the order: “He loved us, and gave himself for us.” As if he had said, “He had no other reason for dying, but because he loved us,” and that “when we were enemies,” (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p42.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Ro 5:10</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p42.1"></a>,) 		as he argues in another Epistle.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p43"></a><i>He gave himself.</i> No words can properly express what this means; for who can find language to declare the excellency of the Son of God? Yet he it is who gave himself as a price for our redemption. Atonement, cleansing, satisfaction, and all the benefits which we derive from the death of Christ, are here represented.   		 <a name="fr_50"></a><a href="#fn_50"><font size="1">51</font></a>
  		 The words <i>for me</i>, are very emphatic. It will not be enough for any man to contemplate Christ as having died for the salvation of the world, unless he has experienced the consequences of this death, and is enabled to claim it as his own.   		 <a name="fr_51"></a><a href="#fn_51"><font size="1">52</font></a>
 </p>  	 
 <p class="Normal"><a name="iii.iv.iv-p46"></a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p46.1"></a></p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p47"></a><b>21.</b> <i>I do not reject.</i> There is great emphasis in this expression; for how dreadful is the ingratitude manifested in despising the grace of God, so invaluable in itself, and obtained at such a price! Yet this heinous offense is charged against the false apostles, who were not satisfied with having Christ alone, but introduced some other aids 		towards obtaining salvation. For, if we do not renounce all other hopes, and embrace Christ alone, we reject the grace of God. And what resource is left to the man, who “puts from him” the grace of God, “and judges himself unworthy of everlasting life?” (<a name="iii.iv.iv-p47.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#046">Ac 13:46</a><a name="iii.iv.iv-p47.1"></a>.)</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p48"></a><i>Christ is dead in vain</i>   		 <a name="fr_52"></a><a href="#fn_52"><font size="1">53</font></a>
  		 There would then have been no value in the death of Christ; or, Christ would have died without any reward; for the reward of his death is, that he has reconciled us to the Father by making an atonement for our sins. Hence it follows, that we are justified by his grace, and, therefore, not by works. The Papists explain this in reference to the ceremonial law; but who does not see that it applies to the whole law? If we could produce a righteousness of our own, then 		Christ has suffered in vain; for the intention of his sufferings was to procure it for us, and what need was there that a work which we could accomplish for ourselves should be obtained from another? If the death of Christ be our redemption, then we were captives; if it be satisfaction, we were debtors; if it be atonement, we were guilty; if it be cleansing, we were unclean. On the contrary, he who ascribes to works his sanctification, pardon, atonement, righteousness, or deliverance, makes 		void the death of Christ.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p51"></a>This argument, we shall perhaps be told, is of no weight against those who propose to unite the grace of Christ with works; which, it is universally admitted, was done by the false apostles. The two doctrines, it is alleged, stand together, that righteousness is by the law, and that we are redeemed by the death of Christ. True; supposing it were granted that a part of our righteousness is obtained by works, and a part comes from grace. 		But such theology, it may easily be proved, was unknown to Paul. His argument with his opponents is either conclusive or inconclusive. If any blasphemer shall dare to accuse him of bad reasoning, a powerful defense is at hand; for that justification in the sight of God of which he treats, is not what men may imagine to be sufficient, but what is absolutely perfect.</p>  	 
 <p><a name="iii.iv.iv-p52"></a>But we are not now called to plead in behalf of Paul against blasphemers, who venture to speak in reproachful language of the Holy Spirit himself. Our present business is with the Papists. They ridicule us, when we argue with Paul that, if righteousness come by works, Christ is dead in vain. They imagine it to be a beautiful reply, with which their sophists furnish them, that Christ merited for us the first grace, that is, the 		opportunity of meriting; and that the merit of his death concurs with the satisfactions of works for the daily pardon of sins. Let them ridicule Paul, whose language we quote. They must refute him before they can refute us. We know that he had to deal with men, who did not entirely reject the grace of Christ, but ascribed the half of salvation to works. In opposition to them he argues, that “if righteousness is by the law, then Christ is dead in vain;” and by so doing, he certainly does not 		allow to works one drop of righteousness. Between those men and the Papists there is no difference; and therefore, in refuting them, we are at liberty to employ Paul’s argument.</p>
