 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p4"></a><b>2</b>. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p7"></a><b>3</b>. Tu igitur feras afflictions, ut bonus miles Iesu Christi.</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p8"></a><b>4</b>. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of <i>this</i> life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p9"></a><b>4</b>. Nemo, qui militat, implicator vitae negotiis, ut imperatori placeat.</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p10"></a><b>5</b>. And if a man also strive for masteries, <i>yet</i> is he not crowned, except he strive lawfully.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p14"></a><b>7</b>. Consider what I say; and the Lord give thee understanding in all things.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p15"></a><b>7</b>. Intellege quae dico; det enim tibi Dominus intellectum in omnibus.</p> 				    				  			   			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p16"></a><a name="iv.iii.i-p16.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p17"></a><b>1</b> <i>Be strong in the grace</i>  As he had formerly commanded him to keep, by the Spirit, that which was committed to him, so now he likewise enjoins him “to be strengthened in grace.” By this expression he intends to shake off sloth and indifference; for the flesh is so sluggish, that even those who are endued with eminent 				gifts are found to slacken in the midst of their course, if they be not frequently aroused.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p18"></a>Some will say: “Of what use is it to exhort a man to ‘be strong in grace,’ unless free-will have something to do in cooperation?” I reply, what God demands from us by his word he likewise bestows by his Spirit, so that we are strengthened in the grace which he has given to us. And yet the exhortations are not superfluous, because the Spirit of God, teaching us inwardly, causes that they shall not sound in our ears fruitlessly and to no 				purpose. Whoever, therefore, shall acknowledge that the present exhortation could not have been fruitful without the secret power of the Spirit, will never support free-will by means of it.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p19"></a><i>Which is in Christ Jesus</i>. This is added for two reasons; to shew that the grace comes from Christ alone, and from no other, and that no Christian will be destitute of it; for, since there is one Christ common to all, it follows that all are partakers of his grace, which is said to be in Christ, because all who belong to Christ must have it.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p20"></a><i>My son</i>. This kind appellation, which he employs, tends much to gain the affections, that the doctrine may more effectually obtain admission into the heart.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p21"></a><a name="iv.iii.i-p21.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p22"></a><b>2</b> <i> And which thou hast heard from me</i>. He again shews how earnestly desirous he is to transmit sound doctrine to posterity; and he exhorts Timothy, not only to preserve its shape and features, (as he formerly did,) but likewise to hand it down to godly teachers, that, being widely spread, it may take root in the hearts of many; for he saw that it 				would quickly perish if it were not soon scattered by the ministry of many persons. And, indeed, we see what Satan did, not long after the death of the Apostles; for, just as if preaching had been buried for some centuries, he brought in innumerable reveries, which, by their monstrous absurdity, surpassed the superstitions of all the heathens. We need not wonder, therefore, if Paul, in order to guard against an evil of such a nature and of such magnitude, earnestly desires that his doctrines 				shall be committed to all godly ministers, who shall be qualified to teach it. As if he had said, — “See that after my death there may remain a sure attestation of my doctrine; and this will be, if thou not only teach faithfully what thou hast learned from me, but take care that it be more widely published by others; therefore, whomsoever thou shalt see fitted for that work, commit to their trust this treasure.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p23"></a><i>Commit to believing men</i> He calls them <i>believing men, </i>not on account of their faith, which is common to all Christians, but on account of their pre-eminence, as possessing a large measure of faith. We might even translate it “<i>faithful</i> men;”   				 <a name="fr_155"></a><a href="#fn_155"><font size="1">156</font></a>
  				 for there are few who sincerely labor to preserve and perpetuate the remembrance of the doctrine intrusted to them. Some are impelled by ambition, and that of various kinds, some by covetousness, some by malice, and others are kept back by the fear of dangers; and therefore extraordinary faithfulness is here demanded.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p25"></a><i>By many witnesses</i>    				 <a name="fr_156"></a><a href="#fn_156"><font size="1">157</font></a>
  				 He does not mean that he produced witnesses in a formal and direct manner   				 <a name="fr_157"></a><a href="#fn_157"><font size="1">158</font></a>
  				 in the case of Timothy; but, because some might raise a controversy whether that which Timothy taught had proceeded from Paul, or had been forged by himself, he removes all doubt by this argument, that he did not speak secretly in a corner, but that there were many alive who could testify that Timothy spoke nothing which they had not formerly heard from the mouth of Paul. The doctrine of Timothy would therefore be beyond suspicion, seeing that they had many 				fellow-disciples, who could bear testimony to it. Hence we learn how greatly a servant of Christ should labor to maintain and defend the purity of doctrine, and not only while he lives, but as long as his care and labor can extend it.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p28"></a><a name="iv.iii.i-p28.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p29"></a><b>3</b> <i> Do thou therefore endure afflictions</i> Not without strong necessity has he added this second exhortation; for they who offer their obedience to Christ must be prepared for “enduring afflictions;” and thus, without patient endurance of evils, there will never be perseverance. And accordingly he adds, “as becomes a 				<i>good soldier of Jesus Christ.” </i>By this term he means that all who serve Christ are warriors, and that their condition as warriors consists, not in inflicting evils, but rather in patience.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p30"></a>These are matters on which it is highly necessary for us to meditate. We see how many there are every day, that throw away their spears, who formerly made a great show of valor. Whence does this arise? Because they cannot become inured to the cross. First, they are so effeminate that they shrink from warfare. Next, they do not know any other way of fighting than to contend haughtily and fiercely with their adversaries; and they cannot 				bear to learn what it is to</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iii.i-p31"></a>“possess their souls in patience.” (<a name="iv.iii.i-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk021.htm#019">Lu 21:19</a><a name="iv.iii.i-p31.1"></a>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p32"></a><a name="iv.iii.i-p32.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p33"></a><b>4</b> <i> No man who warreth</i> He continues to make use of the metaphor which he had borrowed from warfare. Yet, strictly speaking, he formerly called Timothy “a soldier of Christ” metaphorically; but now he compares profane warfare with spiritual and Christian warfare in this sense. “The condition of military discipline is such, 				that as soon as a soldier has enrolled himself under a general, he leaves his house and all his affairs, and thinks of nothing but war; and in like manner, in order that we may be wholly devoted to Christ, we must be free from all the entanglements of this world.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p34"></a><i>With the affairs of life</i> By “the affairs of life”,   				 <a name="fr_158"></a><a href="#fn_158"><font size="1">159</font></a>
  				 he means the care of governing his family, and ordinary occupations; as farmers leave their agriculture, and merchants their ships and merchandise, till they have completed the time that they agreed to serve in war. We must now apply the comparison to the present subject, that every one who wishes to fight under Christ must relinquish all the hindrances and employments of the world, and devote himself unreservedly to the warfare. In short, let us remember the old 				proverb, <a name="iv.iii.i-p35.2"></a><i>Hoc age</i>,   				 <a name="fr_159"></a><a href="#fn_159"><font size="1">160</font></a>
  				 which means, that in the worship of God, we ought to give such earnestness of attention that nothing else should occupy our thoughts and feelings. The old translation has, “No man that fights for God,” etc. But this utterly destroys Paul’s meaning.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p37"></a>Here Paul speaks to the pastors of the Church in the person of Timothy. The statement is general, but is specially adapted to the ministers of the word. First, let them see what things are inconsistent within their office, that, freed from those things, they may follow Christ. Next, let them see, each for himself, what it is that draws them away from Christ; that this heavenly General may not have less authority over us than that which a 				mortal man claims for himself over heathen soldiers who have enrolled under him.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p38"></a><a name="iv.iii.i-p38.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p39"></a><b>5</b> <i>And if any one strive</i> He now speaks of perseverance, that no man may think that he has done enough when he has been engaged in one or two conflicts. He borrows a comparison from wrestlers, not one of whom obtains the prize till he has been victorious in the end. Thus he says:</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iii.i-p40"></a>“In a race all run, but one obtaineth the prize;<br> 				run so that ye may obtain.” (<a name="iv.iii.i-p40.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#024">1Co 9:24</a><a name="iv.iii.i-p40.2"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p41"></a>If any man, therefore, wearied with the conflict, immediately withdraw from the arena to enjoy repose, he will be condemned for indolence instead of being crowned. Thus, because Christ wishes us to strive during our whole life, he who gives way in the middle of the course deprives himself of honor, even though he may have begun valiantly. To <i>strive lawfully</i> is to pursue the contest in such a manner and to such an extent as the law requires, that none may leave off before the time appointed.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p42"></a><a name="iv.iii.i-p42.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p43"></a><b>6</b> <i>The husbandman must labor before he receive the fruits</i> I am well aware that others render this passage differently; and I acknowledge that they translate, word for word, what Paul has written in Greek; but he who shall carefully examine the context will assent to my view.   				 <a name="fr_160"></a><a href="#fn_160"><font size="1">161</font></a>
  				 Besides, the use of (κοπιῶντα) <i>to labor </i>instead of (κοπιᾷν)<i> to labor, </i>is a well-known Greek idiom; for Greek writers often make use of the participle in place of the infinitive.   				 <a name="fr_161"></a><a href="#fn_161"><font size="1">162</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p46"></a>The meaning therefore, is, that husbandmen do not gather the fruit, till they have first toiled hard in the cultivation of the soil, by sowing and by other labors. And if husbandmen do not spare their toils, that one day they may obtain fruit, and if they patiently wait for the season of harvest; how much more unreasonable will it be for us to refuse the labors which Christ enjoins upon us, while he holds out so great a reward?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p47"></a><a name="iv.iii.i-p47.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p48"></a><b>7</b> <i> Understand what I say</i>    				 <a name="fr_162"></a><a href="#fn_162"><font size="1">163</font></a>
  				 He added this, not on account of the obscurity of the comparisons which he has set forth, but that Timothy himself might ponder, how much more excellent is the warfare under the direction of Christ, and how much more abundant the reward; for, when we have studied it incessantly, we scarcely arrive at a full knowledge of it.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.i-p50"></a><i>The Lord give thee understanding in all things</i> The prayer, which now follows, is added by way of correction. Because our minds do not easily rise to that “incorruptible crown” (<a name="iv.iii.i-p50.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1009.htm#025">1Co 9:25</a><a name="iv.iii.i-p50.1"></a>) of the life to come,   				 <a name="fr_163"></a><a href="#fn_163"><font size="1">164</font></a>
  				 Paul betakes himself to God, to “give understanding” to Timothy. And hence we infer, that not less are we taught in vain, if the Lord do not open our understandings, than the commandments would be given in vain, if he did not impart strength to perform them. For who could have taught better than Paul? And yet, in order that he may teach with any advantage, he prays that God may train his disciple.</p>  <a name="iv.iii.ii"></a>  			  				 				     				  
 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p1"></a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#008">2 Timothy 2:8-13</a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p2"></a><b>8</b>. Remember that Jesus Christ the seed of David was raised from the dead according to my gospel:</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p3"></a><b>8</b>. Memonto Iesum Christum excitatum a mortuis, ex semine David, secundum evangelium meum,</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p4"></a><b>9</b>. Wherein I suffer trouble, as an evil doer, <i>even</i> unto bonds; but the word of God is not bound.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p5"></a><b>9</b>. In quo laboro usque ad vincula, tanquam maleficus; sed sermo Dei non est vinctus.</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p6"></a><b>10</b>. Therefore I endure all things for the elect’s sakes, that they may also obtain the salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p7"></a><b>10</b>. Quamobrem omnia tolero propter electos, ut ipsi quoque salutem consequantur, quae est in Christo Iesu, cum gloria aeterna.</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p8"></a><b>11</b> <i>It is </i>a faithful saying: For if we be dead with <i>him</i>, we shall also live with <i>him</i>:</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p10"></a><b>12</b>. If we suffer, we shall also reign with <i>him</i>: if we deny <i>him</i>, he also will deny us:</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p11"></a><b>12</b>. Si sufferimus, etiam simul regnabimus; si negamus, ille quoque negabit nos:</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p12"></a><b>13 </b>If we believe not, <i>yet</i> he abideth faithful: he cannot deny himself.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p13"></a><b>13</b>. Si increduli sumus, ille fidelis manet; negare se ipsum non potest.</p> 				    				  			   			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p14"></a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p14.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p15"></a><b>8</b> <i>Remember that Jesus Christ, being raised from the dead.</i> He expressly mentions some part of his doctrine, which he wished to go down to posterity, entire and uncorrupted. It is probable that he glances chiefly at that part about which he was most afraid; as will also appear clearly from what follows, when he comes to speak about the error of 				“Hymenaeus and Philetus,” (<a name="iv.iii.ii-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#017">2Ti 2:17</a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p15.1"></a>;) for they denied the resurrection, of which we have a sure pledge in this confession, when they falsely said that it was already past.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p16"></a>How necessary this admonition of Paul was, the ancient histories shew; for Satan put forth all his strength, in order to destroy this article of our faith. There being two parts of it, that Christ was born “of the seed of David,” and that he rose from the dead; immediately after the time of the Apostles, arose Marcion, who labored to destroy the truth of the human nature in Christ; and afterwards he was followed by the Manichaeans; and 				even, in the present day, this plague is still spreading.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p17"></a>So far as relates to the resurrection, how many have been employed, and with what diversified schemes, in laboring to overthrow the hope of it! This attestation, therefore, means as much as if Paul had said, “Let no one corrupt or falsify my gospel by slanders; I have thus taught, I have thus preached, that Christ, who was born a man of the seed of David, rose from the dead.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p18"></a><i>According to my gospel</i> He calls it “his gospel,” not that he professes to be the author but the minister of it. Now, in the resurrection of Christ we all have a sure pledge of our own resurrection. Accordingly, he who acknowledges that Christ has risen affirms that the same thing will take place with us also; for Christ did not rise for himself, but for us. The head 				must not be separated from his members. Besides, in the resurrection of Christ is contained the fulfillment of our redemption and salvation; for it is added, <i>from the dead</i>. Thus Christ, who was dead, arose. Why? and for what purpose? Here we must come to ourselves, and here too is manifested the power and fruit of both, namely, of his resurrection and of his death; for we must always hold by this principle, that Scripture is not wont to speak of 				these things coldly, and as matters of history, but makes indirect reference to the fruit.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p19"></a><i>Of the seed of David</i> This clause not only asserts the reality of human nature in Christ, but also claims for him the honor and name of the Messiah. Heretics deny that Christ was a real man, others imagine that his human nature descended from heaven, and others think that there was in him nothing more than the appearance of a man.   				 <a name="fr_164"></a><a href="#fn_164"><font size="1">165</font></a>
  				 Paul exclaims, on the contrary, that he was “of the seed of David;” by which he undoubtedly declares that he was a real man, the son of a human being, that is, of Mary. This testimony is so express, that the more heretics labor to get rid of it, the more do they discover their own impudence. The Jews and other enemies of Christ deny that he is the person who was formerly promised; but Paul affirms that he is the son of David, and that he is descended from that 				family from which the Messiah ought to descend.   				 <a name="fr_165"></a><a href="#fn_165"><font size="1">166</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p22"></a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p22.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p23"></a><b>9</b> <i>In which I am a sufferer</i> This is an anticipation, for his imprisonment lessened the credit due to his gospel in the eyes of ignorant people. He, therefore, acknowledges that, as to outward appearance, he was imprisoned like a criminal; but adds, that his imprisonment did not hinder the gospel from having free course; 				and not only so, but that what he suffers is advantageous to the elect, because it tends to confirm them. Such is the unshaken courage of the martyrs of Christ, when the consciousness of being engaged in a good cause lifts them up above the world; so that, from a lofty position, they look down with contempt, not only on bodily pains and agonies, but on every kind of disgrace.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p24"></a>Moreover, all godly persons ought to strengthen themselves with this consideration, when they see the ministers of the gospel attacked and outraged by adversaries, that they may not, on that account, cherish less reverence for doctrine, but may give glory to God, by whose power they see it burst through all the hindrances of the world. And, indeed, if we were not excessively devoted to the flesh, this consolation alone must have been 				sufficient for us in the midst of persecutions, that, if we are oppressed by the cruelty of the wicked, the gospel is nevertheless extended and more widely diffused; for, whatever they may attempt, so far are they from obscuring or extinguishing the light of the gospel, that it burns the more brightly. Let us therefore bear cheerfully, or at least patiently, to have both our body and our reputation shut up in prison, provided that the truth of God breaks through those fetters, and is spread far 				and wide.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p25"></a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p25.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p26"></a><b>10</b> <i> Wherefore I endure all things for the sake of the elect</i> From the elect he shews, that his imprisonment is so far from being a ground of reproach, that it is highly profitable to the elect. When he says that he endures <i>for the sake of the elect,</i>   				 <a name="fr_166"></a><a href="#fn_166"><font size="1">167</font></a>
  				 this demonstrates how much more he cares for the edification of the Church than for himself; for he is prepared, not only to die, but even to be reckoned in the number of wicked men, that he may promote the salvation of the Church.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p28"></a>In this passage Paul teaches the same doctrine as in <a name="iv.iii.ii-p28.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#024">Col 1:24</a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p28.1"></a>, where he says, that he</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p29"></a>“fills up what is wanting in the sufferings of Christ, for his body, which is the Church.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p30"></a>Hence the impudence of the Papists is abundantly refuted, who infer from these words that the death of Paul was a satisfaction for our sins; as if he claimed anything else for his death, than that it would confirm the faith of the godly, for he immediately adds an exposition, by affirming that the salvation of believers is found in Christ alone. But if any of my readers wishes to see a more extended illustration of this subject, let him 				consult my Commentary on the chapter which I have just now quoted — the first of the Epistle to the Colossians.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p31"></a><i>With eternal glory</i> This is the end of the salvation which we obtain in Christ; for our salvation is to live to God, which salvation begins with our regeneration, and is completed by our perfect deliverance, when God takes us away from the miseries of this mortal life, and gathers us into his kingdom. To this salvation is added the participation of heavenly, that is, 				divine glory; and, therefore, in order to magnify the grace of Christ, he gave to salvation the name of “eternal glory.”</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p33"></a><b>11</b> <i>A faithful saying</i> He makes a preface to the sentiment which he is about to utter; because nothing is more opposite to the feeling of the flesh, than that we must die in order to live, and that death is the entrance into life; for we may gather from other passages, that Paul was wont to make use of a preface of this 				sort, in matters of great importance, or hard to be believed.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p34"></a><i>If we die with him, we shall also live with him</i> The general meaning is, that we shall not be partakers of the life and glory of Christ, unless we have previously died and been humbled with him; as he says, that all the elect were</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p35"></a>“predestinated that they might be conformed to his image.” (<a name="iv.iii.ii-p35.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#029">Ro 8:29</a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p35.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p36"></a>This is said both for exhorting and comforting believers. Who is not excited by this exhortation, that we ought not to be distressed on account of our afflictions, which shall have so happy a result? The same consideration abates and sweetens all that is bitter in the cross; because neither pains, nor tortures, nor reproaches, nor death ought to be received by us with horror, since in these we share with Christ; more especially seeing 				that all these things are the forerunners of a triumph.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p37"></a>By his example, therefore, Paul encourages all believers to receive joyfully, for the name of Christ, those afflictions in which they already have a taste of future glory. If this shocks our belief, and if the cross itself so overpowers and dazzles our eyes, that we do not perceive Christ in them, let us remember to present this shield, “It is a faithful saying.” And, indeed, where Christ is present, we must acknowledge that life and 				happiness are there. We ought, therefore, to believe firmly, and to impress deeply on our hearts, this fellowship, that we do not die apart, but along with Christ, in order that we may afterwards have life in common with him; that we suffer with him, in order that we may be partakers of his glory. By <i>death </i>he means all that outward mortification of which he speaks in <a name="iv.iii.ii-p37.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2004.htm#010">2Co 4:10</a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p37.1"></a>.  				 <a name="fr_167"></a><a href="#fn_167"><font size="1">168</font></a>

How unreasonable is it, that we should esteem more highly the transitory 				life of this world than the holy and sacred name of the Son of God! And why should he reckon among his people those who treacherously reject him? Here the excuse of weakness is of no value;   				 <a name="fr_168"></a><a href="#fn_168"><font size="1">169</font></a>
  				 for, if men did not willingly deceive themselves with vain flatteries, they would constantly resist, being endued with the spirit of strength and courage. Their base denial of Christ proceeds not only from weakness, but from unbelief; because it is in consequence of being blinded by the allurement of the world, that they do not at all perceive the life which is in the kingdom of God. But this doctrine has more need of being meditated on than of being explained; 				for the words of Christ are perfectly clear,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p42"></a>“Whoever shall deny me, him will I also deny” (<a name="iv.iii.ii-p42.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#033">Mt 10:33</a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p42.1"></a>.)</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.ii-p46"></a><i>He cannot deny himself</i> This is a still stronger expression. “Christ is not like us, to swerve from his truth.” Hence it is evident, that all who deny Christ are disowned by him. And thus he drives away from wicked apostates the flatteries with which they soothe themselves; because, being in the habit of changing their hue, according to circumstances, they would 				willingly imagine that Christ, in like manner, assumes various forms, and is liable to change; which Paul affirms to be impossible. Yet, at the same time, we must firmly believe what I stated briefly on a former passage, that our faith is founded on the eternal and unchangeable truth of Christ, in order that it may not waver through the unsteadfastness or apostasy of men.</p>  <a name="iv.iii.iii"></a>

It means that the summary of the gospel which he gave, and the exhortations which he added to it, are of so great importance, that a 				good minister ought never to be weary of exhibiting them; for they are things that deserve to be continually handled, and that cannot be too frequently repeated. “They are things” (he says) “which I wish you not only to teach once, but to take great pains to impress on the hearts of men by frequent repetition.” A good teacher ought to look at nothing else than edification, and to give his whole attention to that alone.   				 <a name="fr_169"></a><a href="#fn_169"><font size="1">170</font></a>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p16"></a><i>Solemnly charging them before the Lord, not to dispute about words. </i>Λογομαχεῖν means to engage earnestly in contentious disputes, which are commonly produced by a foolish desire of being ingenious. <i>Solemn charging</i> <i>before the Lord</i> is intended to strike terror;   				 <a name="fr_171"></a><a href="#fn_171"><font size="1">172</font></a>
  				 and from this severity we learn how dangerous to the Church is that knowledge which leads to debates, that is, which disregards piety, and tends to ostentation; of this nature is the whole of that speculative theology, as it is called, that is found among the Papists.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p18"></a><i>For no use, </i>On two grounds, λογομαχία, or “disputing about words,” is condemned by him. It is of no advantage, and it is exceedingly hurtful, by disturbing weak minds. Although in the version I have followed Erasmus, because it did not disagree with Paul’s meaning, yet I wish to inform my readers that Paul’s words may be 				explained in this manner, “That which is useful for nothing.” The Greek words are, εἰς οὐδὲν χρήσιμον, and I read <i>χρήσιμον</i> in the accusative case, and not in the nominative. The style will thus flow more agreeably; as if he had said, “Of what use is it, when no good comes from it, but much evil? for the faith of many is subverted.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p19"></a>Let us remark, first, that, when a manner of teaching does no good, for that single reason it is justly disapproved; for God does not wish to indulge our curiosity, but to instruct us in a useful manner. Away with all speculations, therefore, which produce no edification!</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p20"></a>But the second is much worse, when questions are raised, which are not only unprofitable, but tend <i>to the subversion of the hearers</i>  I wish that this were attended to by those who are always armed for fighting with the tongue, and who, in every question are looking for grounds of quarreling, and who go so far as to lay snares around every word 				or syllable. But they are carried in a wrong direction by ambition, and sometimes by an almost fatal disease; which I have experienced in some. What the Apostle says about <i>subverting</i> is shown, every day, by actual observation, to be perfectly true; for it is natural, amidst disputes, to lose sight of the truth; and Satan avails himself of quarrels as a presence for disturbing weak persons, and overthrowing their 				faith.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p22"></a><b>15</b> <i>Study to shew thyself to be approved by God</i> Since all disputes about doctrine arise from this source, that men are desirous to make a boast of ingenuity before the world, Paul here applies the best and most excellent remedy, when he commands Timothy to keep his eyes fixed on God; as if he had said; “Some aim at the 				applause of a crowded assembly, but do thou study to approve thyself and thy ministry to God.” And indeed there is nothing that tends more to check a foolish eagerness for display, than to reflect that we have to deal with God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p23"></a><i>A workman that doth not blush</i> Erasmus translates ἀνεπαίσχυντον <i>“</i>that ought not to blush.” I do not find fault with that rendering, but prefer to explain it actively, “that doth not blush;”, both because that is the more ordinary meaning of the word as used by Greek 				writers, and because I consider it to agree better with the present passage. There is an implied contrast. Those who disturb the Church by contentions break out into that fierceness, because they are ashamed of being overcome, and because they reckon it disgraceful that there should be anything that they do not know. Paul, on the contrary, bids them appeal to the judgment of God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p24"></a>And first, he bids them be not lazy disputants, but <i>workmen.</i> By this term he indirectly reproves the foolishness of those who so greatly torment themselves by doing nothing. Let us therefore be “workmen” in building the Church, and let us be employed in the work of God in such a manner that some fruit shall be seen then we shall have no cause to “blush;” for, although in debating we be not equal to talkative boasters, yet it will 				be enough that we excel them in the desire of edification, in industry, in courage, and in the efficacy of doctrine. In short, he bids Timothy labor diligently, that he may not be ashamed before God; whereas ambitious men dread only this kind of shame, to lose nothing of their reputation for acuteness or profound knowledge.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p25"></a><i>Dividing aright the word of truth</i>. This is a beautiful metaphor, and one that skillfully expresses the chief design of teaching. “Since we ought to be satisfied with the word of God alone, what purpose is served by having sermons every day, or even the office of pastors? Has not every person an opportunity of reading the Bible?”   				 <a name="fr_172"></a><a href="#fn_172"><font size="1">173</font></a>
  				 But Paul assigns to teachers the duty of dividing or cutting,   				 <a name="fr_173"></a><a href="#fn_173"><font size="1">174</font></a>
  				 as if a father, in giving food to his children, were dividing the bread, by cutting it into small pieces.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p28"></a>He advises Timothy to “cut aright,” lest, when he is employed in cutting the surface, as unskillful people are wont to do, he leave the pith and marrow untouched. Yet by this term I understand, generally, an allotment of the word which is judicious, and which is well suited to the profit of the hearers. Some mutilate it, others tear it, others torture it, others break it in pieces, others, keeping by the outside, (as we have said,) 				never come to the soul of doctrine.  				 <a name="fr_174"></a><a href="#fn_174"><font size="1">175</font></a>
  				To all these faults he contrasts time “dividing aright,” that is, the manner of explaining which is adapted to edification; for that is the rule by which we must try all interpretation of Scripture.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p35"></a><b>17</b> <i>And their word will eat as a gangrene</i> I have been told by Benedict Textor, a physician, that this passage is badly translated by Erasmus, who, out of two diseases quite different from each other, has made but one disease; for, instead of “gangrene,” he has used the word “cancer.” Now Galen, in many passages 				throughout his writings, and especially where he lays down definitions in his small work “On unnatural swellings,” distinguishes the one from the other. Paul Aegineta, too, on the authority of Galen, thus in his sixth book defines a “cancer;” that it is “an unequal swelling, with inflated extremities, loathsome to the sight, of a leaden color, and unaccompanied by pain.” Next, he enumerates two kinds, as other physicians do; for he says that some “cancers” are concealed and have no ulcer; while 				others, in which there is a preponderance of the black bile from which they originate, are ulcerous.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p36"></a>Of the “gangrene,” on the other hand, Galen, both in the small work already quoted, and in his second book to Glauco, Aetius in his fourteenth book, and the same Ægineta in his fourth book, speak to the following effect; that it proceeds from great phlegmons or inflammations, if they fall violently on any member, so that the part which is destitute of heat and vital energy tends to destruction. If that part be quite 				dead, the Greek writers call the disease σφάκελος the Latins <a name="iv.iii.iii-p36.1"></a><i>sideratio</i><i>, </i>and the common people call it St. Anthony’s fire.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p37"></a>I find, indeed, that Cornelius Celsius draws the distinction in this manner, that “cancer “is the genus, and “gangrene” the species; but his mistake is plainly refuted from numerous passages in the works of physicians of high authority. It is possible, also, that he was led astray by the similarity between the Latin words “<a name="iv.iii.iii-p37.1"></a>cancer“ and “<a name="iv.iii.iii-p37.2"></a>gangræna.” But in the Greek words there can be no mistake of that kind; for κάρκινος is the name which corresponds to the Latin word “<a name="iv.iii.iii-p37.3"></a>cancer,” and denotes both the 				animal which we call a crab, and the disease; while grammarians think that γάγγραινα is derived ἀπο τοῦ γραίνειν which means “to eat.” We must therefore abide by the word “gangrene,” which Paul uses, and which best agrees with what he says as to “eating” or “consuming.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p38"></a>We have now explained the etymology; but all physicians pronounce the nature of the disease to be such, that, if it be not very speedily counteracted, it spreads to the adjoining parts, and penetrates even to the bones, and does not cease to consume, till it has killed the man. Since, therefore, “gangrene” is immediately followed by (νέκρωσις) mortification, which 				rapidly infects the rest of the members till it end in the universal destruction of the body; to this mortal contagion Paul elegantly compares false doctrines; for, if you once give entrance to them, they spread till they have completed the destruction of the Church. The contagion being so destructive, we must meet it early, and not wait till it has gathered strength by progress; for there will then be no time for rendering assistance. The dreadful extinction of the gospel among the Papists 				arose from this cause, that, through the ignorance or slothfulness of the pastors, corruptions prevailed long and without control, in consequence of which the purity of doctrine was gradually destroyed.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iii-p39"></a><i>Of the number of whom are Hymenaeus and Philetus</i> He points out with the finger the plagues themselves, that all may be on their guard against them; for, if those persons who aim at the ruin of the whole Church are permitted by us to remain concealed, then to some extent we give them power to do injury. It is true that we ought to conceal the faults of brethren, but 				only those faults the contagion of which is not widely spread. But where there is danger to many, our dissimulation is cruel, if we do not expose in proper time the hidden evil. And why? Is it proper, for the sake of sparing one individual, that a hundred or a thousand persons shall perish through my silence? Besides, Paul did not intend to convey this information to Timothy alone, but he intended to proclaim to all ages and to all nations the wickedness of the two men, in order to shut the 				door against their base and ruinous doctrine.</p>

By this trick Satan overthrows that fundamental article of our faith concerning the resurrection of the flesh. Being an old and worthless dream, and being so severely condemned by Paul, it ought to give us the less uneasiness. But when we learn that, from the very beginning of the gospel, <i>the faith of some was subverted, </i>such an example ought to 				excite us to diligence, that we may seize an early opportunity of driving away from ourselves and others so dangerous a plague; for, in consequence of the strong inclination of men to vanity, there is no absurdity so monstrous that there shall not be some men who shall lend their ear to it.</p>  <a name="iv.iii.iv"></a>

But they who in the ordinary opinion of men held a distinguished rank, having been formerly regarded as pillars, cannot fall in this manner, without involving others in the same ruin with themselves; at least, if their faith has no other support.

 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p10"></a>He makes use of this consolation, that the levity or treachery of men cannot hinder God from preserving his Church to the last. And first he reminds us of the election of God, which he metaphorically calls <i>a foundation,</i> expressing by this word the firm and enduring constancy of it. Yet all this tends to prove the certainty of our salvation, if we are of the elect of God.

 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p13"></a>First of all, therefore, let us hold this principle, that, amidst so great weakness of our flesh, the elect are nevertheless beyond the reach of danger, because they do not stand by their own strength, but are founded on God. And if foundations laid by the hand of men have so much firmness, how much more solid will be that which has been laid by God himself? I am aware that some refer this to doctrine, “Let no man judge of the truth of 				it from the unsteadfastness of men;” but it may easily be inferred from the context, that Paul speaks of the Church of God, or of the elect.</p>

 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p18"></a>“they who went out from us were not of us.” (<a name="iv.iii.iv-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#019">1Jo 2:19</a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p18.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p19"></a>Hence arises a twofold advantage. First, our faith will not be shaken, as if it depended on men; nor shall we be even dismayed, as often happens, when unexpected events take place. Secondly, being convinced that the Church shall nevertheless be safe, we shall more patiently endure that the reprobate go away into their own lot, to which they were appointed; because there will remain the full number, with which God is satisfied. Therefore, 				whenever any sudden change happens among men, contrary to our opinion and expectation, let us immediately call to remembrance, “The Lord knoweth who are his.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p20"></a><i>Let every one that calleth on the name of Christ depart from iniquity</i>  As he formerly met the scandal by saying, “Let not the revolt of any man produce excessive alarm in believers;” so now, by holding out this example of hypocrites, he shews that we must not sport with God by a feigned profession of Christianity. As if he had said, “Since God thus punishes hypocrites by 				exposing their wickedness, let us learn to fear him with a sincere conscience, lest anything of that kind should happen to us. Whoever, therefore, calleth upon God, that is, professeth to be, and wisheth to be reckoned, one of the people of God, let him keep at a distance from all iniquity.”   				 <a name="fr_176"></a><a href="#fn_176"><font size="1">177</font></a>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p25"></a><b>20</b> <i> In a great house</i> He now goes farther, and demonstrates by a comparison, that when we see some who, for a time, made a show of distinguished piety and zeal, fall back shamefully, so far from being troubled on account of it, we ought rather to acknowledge that this arrangement is seemly and adapted to the providence of 				God. Who will find fault with a large house, in which there is abundance of every kind of furniture, and which accordingly contains not only those articles which are fitted for purposes of display, but likewise those which are of a meaner sort? This diversity is even ornamental, if, while the sideboard and the table glitter with gold and silver, the kitchen is furnished with vessels of wood and of earthenware. Why then should we wonder if God, the head of the family, so rich and so abundantly 				supplied with everything, has in this world, as in a large house, various kinds of men, as so many parts of furniture?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p26"></a>Commentators are not agreed, however, whether the “great house” means the Church alone, or the whole world. And, indeed, the context rather leads us to understand it as denoting the Church; for Paul is not now reasoning about strangers, but about God’s own family. Yet what he says is true generally, and in another passage the same Apostle extends it to the whole world; that is, at 				<a name="iv.iii.iv-p26.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#021">Ro 9:21</a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p26.1"></a>, where he includes all the reprobate under the same word that is here used. We need not greatly dispute, therefore, if any person shall apply it simply to the world. Yet there can be no doubt that Paul’s object is to shew that we ought not to think it strange, that bad men are mixed with the good, which happens chiefly in the Church.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p27"></a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p27.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p28"></a><b>21</b> <i> If any man shall cleanse himself from these</i> If the reprobate are “vessels for dishonor,” they have that dishonor confined to themselves, but they do not disfigure the house, or bring any disgrace on the head of the family, who, while he has a variety of articles of furniture, appropriates each vessel to its proper 				use. But let us learn, by their example, to apply them to better and worthier uses; for in the reprobate, as in mirrors, we perceive how detestable is the condition of man, if he do not sincerely promote the glory of God. Such examples, therefore, afford to us good ground for exhortation to devote ourselves to a holy and blameless life.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p29"></a>There are many who misapply this passage, for the sake of proving that what Paul elsewhere (<a name="iv.iii.iv-p29.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#016">Ro 9:16</a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p29.1"></a>) declares to belong “to God that sheweth mercy,” is actually within the power of “him that willeth and him that runneth.” This is exceedingly frivolous; for Paul does not here argue about the election of men, in order to shew what is the cause of it, 				as he does in the ninth chapter of the Epistle to the Romans (<a name="iv.iii.iv-p29.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#000">Ro 9</a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p29.2"></a>); but only means that we are unlike wicked men, whom we perceive to have been born to their perdition. It is consequently foolish to draw an inference from these words, about the question whether it is in a man’s power to place himself in the number of the children of God, and to be the author of his own adoption. That is not the present 				question. Let this short warning suffice against those who bid a man cause himself to be predestinated; as if Paul enjoined men to do what they must have done before they were born, and even before the foundations of the world were laid.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p30"></a>Others, who infer from these words that free-will is sufficient for preparing a man, that he may be fit and qualified for obeying God, do not at first sight appear to be so absurd as the former, yet there is no solidity in what they advance. The Apostle enjoins that men who desire to consecrate themselves to the Lord cleanse themselves from the pollution of wicked men; and throughout the Scriptures God gives the same injunction; for we 				find nothing here but what we have seen in many passages of Paul’s writings, and especially in the Second Epistle to the Corinthians,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p31"></a>“Be ye clean, that bear the vessels of the Lord.”   				 <a name="fr_177"></a><a href="#fn_177"><font size="1">178</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p33"></a>Beyond all controversy, we are called to holiness. But the question about the calling and duty of Christians is totally different from the question about their power or ability. We do not deny that it is demanded from believers that they purify themselves; but elsewhere the Lord declares that this is their duty, while he promises by Ezekiel that he will send</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p34"></a>“clean waters, that we may be cleansed.” (<a name="iv.iii.iv-p34.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze036.htm#025">Eze 36:25</a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p34.1"></a>.)</p>

In like manner, what is <i>useful </i>to the head of the family is put for that which is applied to agreeable purposes. He afterwards explains the metaphor, when he adds, that we must <i>be prepared for every good work. 				</i>Away with the wild language of fanatics, “I will contribute to the glory of God, as Pharaoh did; for is it not all one, provided that God be glorified?” For here God explicitly states in what manner he wishes us to serve him, that is, by a religious and holy life.</p>  <a name="iv.iii.v"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p13"></a><b>22</b> <i>Flee youthful desires.</i> This is an inference from what goes before; for, after mentioning useless questions, and having been led by this circumstance to censure Hymenaeus and Philetus, whose ambition and vain curiosity had led them away from the right faith, he again exhorts Timothy to keep at a distance from so 				dangerous a plague, and for this purpose he advises him to avoid “youthful desires.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p14"></a>By this term he does not mean either a propensity to uncleanness, or any of those licentious courses or sinful lusts in which young men frequently indulge, but any impetuous passions to which the excessive warmth of that age is prone. If some debate has arisen, young men more quickly grow warm, are more easily irritated, more frequently blunder through want of experience, and rush forward with greater confidence and rashness, than men of 				riper age. With good reason, therefore, does Paul advise Timothy, being a young man, to be strictly on his guard against the vices of youth, which otherwise might easily drive him to useless disputes.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p15"></a><i>But follow righteousness</i> He recommends the opposite feelings, that they may restrain his mind from breaking out into any youthful excesses; as if he had said, “These are the things to which thou oughtest to give thy whole attention, and thy whole exertions.” And first he mentions <i>righteousness,</i> that is, the right way of 				living; and afterwards he adds <i>faith</i> and <i>love, </i>in which it principally consists. <i>Peace </i>is closely connected with the present subject; for they who delight in the questions which he forbids must be contentious and fond of debating.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p16"></a><i>With all that call on the Lord</i> Here, by a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the whole, “calling on God” is taken generally for worship, if it be not thought preferable to refer it to profession. But this is the chief part of the worship of God, and for that reason “calling on God” often signifies the whole of religion or the worship of God. But when he bids 				him seek “peace with all that call upon the Lord,” it is doubtful whether, on the one hand, he holds out all believers as an example, as if he had said, that he ought to pursue this in common with all the true worshippers of God, or, on the other hand, he enjoins Timothy to cultivate peace with them. The latter meaning appears to be more suitable.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p18"></a><b>23</b> <i> But avoid foolish and uninstructive questions</i> He calls them <i>foolish, </i>because they are <i>uninstructive; </i>that is, they contribute nothing to godliness, whatever show of 				acuteness they may hold out. When we are wise in a useful manner, then alone are we truly wise. This ought to be carefully observed; for we see what foolish admiration the world entertains for silly trifles, and how eagerly it runs after them. That an ambition to please may not urge us to seek the favor of men by such display, let us always remember this remarkable testimony of Paul, that questions, which are held in high estimation, are nevertheless foolish, because they are 				unprofitable.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p19"></a><i>Knowing that they beget quarrels</i> Next, he expresses the evil which they commonly produce. And here he says nothing else than what we experience every day, that they give occasion for jangling and debates. And yet the greater part of men, after having received so many instructions, do not at all profit by them.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p21"></a><b>24</b> <i> But the servant of the Lord must not fight</i> Paul’s argument is to this effect: “The servant of God must stand aloof from contentions; but foolish questions are contentions; therefore whoever desires to be a ‘servant of God,’ and to be accounted such, ought to shun them.” And if superfluous questions ought to be avoided 				on this single ground, that it is unseemly for a servant of God to fight, how impudently do they act, who have the open effrontery of claiming applause for raising incessant controversies? Let the theology of the Papists now come forth; what else will be found in it than the art of disputing and fighting?

  				<i> qualified for teaching</i> When he bids the servant of Christ be “gentle,” he demands a virtue which is opposite to the disease of contentions. <i>To </i>the same purpose is what immediately follows, that he be διδακτικός, “qualified for teaching.” There will be no room for instruction, if he have not moderation and some 				equability of temper. What limit will be observed by a teacher, when he is warmed for fighting? The better a man is qualified for teaching, the more earnestly does he keep aloof from quarrels and disputes.</p>

  				 The importunity of some men may sometimes produce either irritation or weariness; and for that reason he adds, “bearing with them,” at the same time pointing out the reason why it is necessary; namely, because a godly teacher ought even to try whether it be possible for him to bring back to the right path obstinate and rebellious persons, which cannot be done without the exercise of gentleness.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p27"></a><b>25</b> <i> If sometime God grant to them repentance</i> This expression, “If sometime,” or “If perhaps,” points out the difficulty of the case, as being nearly desperate or beyond hope. Paul therefore means that even towards the most unworthy we must exercise <i>meekness; </i>and although 				at first there be no appearance of having gained advantage, still we must make the attempt. For the same reason he mentions that “God will grant it.” Since the conversion of a man is in the hand of God, who knows whether they who today appear to be unteachable shall be suddenly changed by the power of God, into other men? Thus, whoever shall consider that repentance is the gift and work of God, will cherish more earnest hope, and, encouraged by this confidence, will bestow more toil and 				exertion for the instruction of rebels. We should view it thus, that our duty is, to be employed in sowing and watering, and, while we do this, we must look for the increase from God.

 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p28"></a><i>To the knowledge of the truth</i> We may learn from this what is the actual repentance of those who for a time were disobedient to God; for Paul declares that it begins with “the knowledge of the truth.” By this he means that the understanding of man is blinded, so long as it stands out fiercely against God and his doctrine.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p30"></a><b>26</b> <i>And deliverance from the snare of the devil</i> Illumination is followed by deliverance from the bondage of the devil; for unbelievers are so intoxicated by Satan, that, being asleep, they do not perceive their distresses. On the other hand, when the Lord shines upon us by the light of his truth, he wakens us out of that 				deadly sleep, breaks asunder the snares by which we were bound, and, having removed all obstacles, trains us to obedience to him.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p31"></a><i>By whom they are held captive</i> A truly shocking condition, when the devil has so great power over us, that he drags us, as captive slaves, here and there at his pleasure. Yet such is the condition of all those whom the pride of their heart draws away from subjection to God. And this tyrannical dominion of Satan we see plainly, every day, in the reprobate; for they would 				not rush with such fury and with brutal violence into every kind of base and disgraceful crimes, if they were not drawn by the unseen power of Satan. That is what we saw at <a name="iv.iii.v-p31.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</a><a name="iv.iii.v-p31.1"></a>,   				 <a name="fr_180"></a><a href="#fn_180"><font size="1">181</font></a>

 <p><a name="iv.iii.v-p33"></a>Such examples admonish us to keep ourselves carefully under the yoke of Christ, and to yield ourselves to be governed by his Holy Spirit. And yet a captivity of this nature does not excuse wicked men, so that they do not sin, because it is by the instigation of Satan that they sin; for, although their being carried along so resistlessly to that which is evil proceeds from the dominion of Satan, yet they do nothing by constraint, but are 				inclined with their whole heart to that to which Satan drives them. The result is, that their captivity is voluntary.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p21"></a> “If we wish to be victorious over all the temptations of Satan, we must have great steadfastness, and must know that it is not at random that we believe in Jesus Christ, that this is not a doubtful matter, but that he came to us from God to be our Redeemer. And for this reason Paul here points out that he is of the lineage of David, and of his seed, for we know the promises that are contained in the Holy Scriptures, namely, that the whole 					 world should be blessed in the seed of Abraham. Now, God confirmed this to David, by shewing that from him the Redeemer should proceed, that is, from the tribe of Judah, and from the house of David. Thus, the reason why Paul claims for him this title is, that, having the promises which God had formerly made to the fathers, concerning that Redeemer who hath been given to us, we may not doubt that we ought to receive him with full conviction, and have no reason to doubt whether he is, or is not, 					 the Messiah. Why? He is descended from the house of David; and, although at that time, it had no royal dignity, yet that defect could not lessen the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ, but, on the contrary, was fitted to confirm more fully our belief that it was he who should be sent. And why? The Prophet Isaiah did not say that he would be born in a palace, or that he would be brought up in great splendor; but he said, that he would grow as a small twig (<a name="iv.iii.ii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa011.htm#001">Isa 11:1</a><a name="iv.iii.ii-p21.1"></a>) from the root of Jesse; as if he had said, that, although Jesus Christ was of royal lineage, nevertheless his parents were poor, and were held of no account in worldly matters, having no rank or grandeur.” — <i>Fr. Ser.</i></p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.iii.ii-p27"></a> “It might be replied, that it is superfluous that Paul should ‘endure for the elect.’ ‘Cannot God save those whom he elected and adopted before the creation of the world, without the assistance of men? Has the immutable decree of God any need of human help, or of creatures? Why then does Paul say that he endures on account of the elect?’ Now, it us true that God will conduct his people to the inheritance which is prepared for them but yet he 					 is pleased to make use of the labor of men. Not that he is under a necessity of borrowing anything from us, but he confers on us this honor by his undeserved goodness, and wishes that we should be instruments of his power. Thus Paul does not boast that the salvation of the children of God depends on his steadfastness or on the afflictions which he had to endure; but he only means that God wishes to conduct his people by means of the word, and that he employs men whom he has chosen for that 					 purpose, as for his own work, and makes them instruments of the power of his Holy Spirit.” — <i>Fr.

If, therefore, God refreshes our memory with it, he has conferred on us a great favor. That is what we have to remark on this passage, when Paul says, ‘Remind them of these things.’ For undoubtedly he intended to prevent what we frequently meet with, when it is said, ‘We have heard this before. Is not that a very common remark? Where is the little child that does not know 					 it?” Such things are said by those who would wish to be fed with useless questions.

There are but two points in Scripture, that we ought to love God and to love our neighbor. 					 We have not heard these things merely from those who come to relate them; but the most distinguished scholars of those who vomited out these blasphemies have themselves declared them to us. I could name the day when it was said, and the houses, and the hour, and the people who were present, and how wicked men poured out their venom and their passion against God, to overthrow and destroy all religion, if it were possible; that is but too well known. On the contrary, Paul shews us here, that if 					 we have only the Holy Scripture, it is not enough that each of us read it in private, but the doctrine drawn from it must be preached to us in order that we may be well informed” — <i>Fr.

Let us therefore pray to God that he may sign and seal in our hearts his gracious election, by his holy Spirit, and, at the same time, that he may keep us sealed and as shut up under the shadow of his wings; and if poor reprobates go astray and are lost, and if the devil drives them along, and if they do not rise again when they fall, but are cast down and ruined, let us, on our part, pray to God to 					 keep us under his protection, that we may know what it is to obey his will, and to be supported by him.

We must, therefore, have that mildness and humanity dwelling in us, so as to be ready to receive all who wish to be instructed. And therefore, he 					 adds, that we must be `qualified for teaching,’ as if he had said, that those things are connected with each other, gentleness and skill in teaching. The reason is, if a man be fierce and inaccessible, it will never be possible for us to receive instruction from him. He who wishes to be a good teacher must conduct himself with civility, and must have some way of drawing those who come to him, so as to gain their affections; and that cannot be, unless he have that ‘gentleness’ of which Paul 					 speaks. Thus we see how he intended to confirm what he had briefly stated, that a man who is quarrelsome, and addicted to disputes and contentions, is in no degree a servant of God. And why? As servants of God, must we not labor to gain poor ignorant persons? And that cannot be, unless we are mild, unless we hear patiently what they say, unless we bear with their weakness, until by little and little they are edified. If we have not that, it is like casting them off.” — <i>Fr. Ser.</i></p>
