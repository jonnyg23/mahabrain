 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p6"></a><a name="iv.ii.i-p6.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p7"></a><b>1</b> <i>Paul an Apostle</i> From the very preface we already perceive that Paul had not in view Timothy alone; other wise he would not have employed such lofty titles in asserting his apostleship; for what purpose would it have served to employ these ornaments of language in writing to one who was fully convinced of the fact? He, 				therefore, lays claim to that authority over all which belonged to his public character and he does this the more diligently, because, being near death, he wishes to secure the approbation of the whole course of his ministry,   				 <a name="fr_134"></a><a href="#fn_134"><font size="1">135</font></a>
  				 and to seal his doctrine which he had labored so hard to teach, that it may be held sacred by posterity, and to leave a true portrait of it in Timothy.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p9"></a><i>Of Jesus Christ by the will of God</i> First, according to his custom, he calls himself an “Apostle of Christ.” Hence it follows, that he does not speak as a private person, and must not be heard slightly, and for form’s sake,   				 <a name="fr_135"></a><a href="#fn_135"><font size="1">136</font></a>
  				 like a man, but as one who is a representative of Christ. But because the dignity of the office is too great to belong to any man, except by the special gift and election of God, he at the same time pronounces a eulogy on his calling, by adding that he was ordained by <i>the will of God</i> His apostleship, therefore, having God for its author and defender, is beyond all dispute.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p11"></a><i>According to the promise of life</i> That his calling may be the more certain, he connects it with the promises of eternal life; as if he had said, “As from the beginning God promised eternal life in Christ, so now he has appointed me to be the minister for proclaiming that promise.” Thus also he points out the design of his apostleship, namely, to bring men to Christ, that 				in him they may find life.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p12"></a><i>Which is in Christ Jesus</i> He speaks with great accuracy, when he mentions that “the promise of life” was indeed given, in ancient times, to the fathers. (<a name="iv.ii.i-p12.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006">Ac 26:6</a><a name="iv.ii.i-p12.1"></a>.) But yet he declares that this life is in Christ, in order to inform us that the faith of those who 				lived under the Law must nevertheless have looked towards Christ; and that <i>life, </i>which was contained in promises, was, in some respects, suspended, till it was exhibited in Christ.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p13"></a><a name="iv.ii.i-p13.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p14"></a><b>2</b> <i>My beloved son</i> By this designation he not only testifies his love of Timothy, but procures respect and submission to him; because he wishes to be acknowledged in him, as one who may justly be called his son,   				 <a name="fr_136"></a><a href="#fn_136"><font size="1">137</font></a>
  				 The reason of the appellation is, that he had begotten him in Christ; for, although this honor belongs to God alone, yet it is also transferred to ministers, whose agency he employs for regenerating us.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.i-p16"></a><i>Grace, mercy</i>  The word <i>mercy</i>, which he employs here, is commonly left out by him in his ordinary salutations. I think that he introduced it, when he poured out his feelings with more than ordinary vehemence. Moreover, he appears to have inverted the order; for, since “mercy” is the cause of “grace,” it ought to have come 				before it in this passage. But still it is not unsuitable that it should be put after “grace”, in order to express more clearly what is the nature of that grace, and whence it proceeds; as if he had added, in the form of a declaration, that the reason why we are loved by God is, that he is merciful. Yet this may also be explained as relating to God’s daily benefits, which are so many testimonies of his “mercy”; for, whenever he assists us, whenever he delivers us from evils, pardons our sins, 				and bears with our weakness, he does so, because he has compassion on us.</p>  <a name="iv.ii.ii"></a>  			  				 				     				  
 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p1"></a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#003">2 Timothy 1:3-5</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p1.1"></a></p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p2"></a><b>3</b>. I thank God, whom I serve from <i>my</i> forefathers with pure conscience, that without ceasing I have remembrance of thee in my prayers night and day;</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p3"></a><b>3</b>. Gratias ago Deo, quem colo a progenitoribus in conscientia, ut assiduam tui mentionem facio in pecibus meis die et noctu,</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p4"></a><b>4</b>. Greatly desiring to see thee, being mindful of thy tears, that I may be filled with joy;</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p5"></a><b>4</b>. Desiderans to videre, memor tuarum lacrymarum, ut gaudio implear,</p> 				    				 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p6"></a><b>5</b>. When I call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee, which dwelt first in thy grandmother Lois, and thy mother Eunice; and I am persuaded that in thee also.</p> 				     				  
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p7"></a><b>5</b>. Memoria repetens eam, quae in to est, sinceram fidem, quae et habitavit primum in avia tua Loide, et in matre tua Eunice; persuasum habeo quòd etiam in to.</p> 				    				  			   			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p8"></a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p8.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p9"></a><b>3</b> <i> I give thanks</i> The meaning usually assigned to these words is, that Paul “gives thanks to God,” and next assigns the cause or ground of thanksgiving; namely, that he is unceasingly mindful of Timothy. But let my readers consider whether the following sense do not suit equally well and even better: “Whenever I remember 				thee in my prayers, (and I do so continually,) I also give thanks concerning thee;” for the particle ὡς most frequently has that meaning;   				 <a name="fr_137"></a><a href="#fn_137"><font size="1">138</font></a>
  				 and, indeed, any meaning that can be drawn from a different translation is exceedingly meager. According to this exposition, prayer will be a sign of carefulness, and thanksgiving a sign of joy; that is, he never thought of Timothy without calling to remembrance the eminent virtues with which he was adorned. Hence arises ground of thanksgiving; for the recollection of the gifts of God is always pleasant and delightful to believers. Both are proofs of real 				friendship. He calls the <i>mention </i>of him (ἀδιάλειπτον) <i>unceasing, </i>because he never forgets him when he prays.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p11"></a><i>Whom I worship from my ancestors</i> This declaration he made in opposition to those well-known calumnies with which the Jews everywhere loaded him, as if he had forsaken the religion of his country, and apostatized from the law of Moses. On the contrary, he declares that he worships God, concerning whom he had been taught by his ancestors, that is, the God of Abraham, who 				revealed himself to the Jews, who delivered his law by the hand of Moses; and not some pretended God, whom he had lately made for himself.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p12"></a>But here it may be asked, “Since Paul glories in following the religion handed down from his ancestors, is this a sufficiently solid foundation? For hence it follows, that this will be a plausible presence for excusing all superstitions, and that it will be a crime, if any one depart, in the smallest degree, from the institutions of his ancestors, whatever these are.” The answer is easy. He does not here lay down a fixed rule, that every 				person who follows the religion that he received from his fathers is believed to worship God aright, and, on the other hand, that he who departs from the custom of his ancestors is at all to blame for it. For this circumstance must always be taken into account, that Paul was not descended from idolaters, but from the children of Abraham, who worshipped the true God. We know what Christ says, in disapproving of all the false worship of the Gentiles, that the Jews alone maintained the true method 				of worship. Paul, therefore, does not rest solely on the authority of the fathers, nor does he speak indiscriminately of all his ancestors; but he removes that false opinion, with which he knew that he was unjustly loaded, that he had forsaken the God of Israel, and framed for himself a strange god.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p13"></a><i>In a pure conscience</i> It is certain that Paul’s conscience was not always pure; for he acknowledges that he was deceived by hypocrisy, while he gave loose reins to sinful desire.   				 <a name="fr_138"></a><a href="#fn_138"><font size="1">139</font></a>
  				 (<a name="iv.ii.ii-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#008">Ro 7:8</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p14.2"></a>.) The excuse which Chrysostom offers for what Paul did while he was a Pharisee, on the ground that he opposed the gospel, not through malice, but through ignorance, is not a satisfactory reply to the objection; for “a pure conscience” is no ordinary commendation, and cannot be separated from the sincere and hearty fear of God. I, therefore, limit 				it to the present time, in this manner, that he worships the same God as was worshipped by his ancestors, but that now he worships him with pure affection of the heart, since the time when he was enlightened by the gospel.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p15"></a>This statement has the same object with the numerous protestations of the apostles, as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles:</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p16"></a>“I serve the God of my fathers, believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets.” (<a name="iv.ii.ii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act024.htm#014">Ac 24:14</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p16.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p17"></a>Again,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p18"></a>“And now I stand to be judged concerning the hope of the promise which was made to our fathers, to which hope our twelve tribes hope to come.” (<a name="iv.ii.ii-p18.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#006">Ac 26:6</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p18.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p19"></a>Again,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.ii-p20"></a>“On account of the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.” (<a name="iv.ii.ii-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act028.htm#020">Ac 28:20</a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p20.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p21"></a><i>In my prayers night and day</i> Hence we see how great was his constancy in prayer; and yet he affirms nothing about himself but what Christ recommends to all his followers. We ought, therefore, to be moved and inflamed by such examples to imitate them, so far, at least, that an exercise so necessary may be more frequent among us. If any one understand this to mean the daily 				and nightly prayers which Paul was wont to offer at stated hours, there will be no impropriety in that view; though I give a more simple interpretation, that there was no time when he was not employed in prayer.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p22"></a><a name="iv.ii.ii-p22.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p23"></a><b>5</b> <i>Calling to remembrance that unfeigned faith</i> Not so much for the purpose of applauding as of exhorting Timothy, the Apostle commends both his own faith and that of his grandmother and mother; for, when one has begun well and valiantly, the progress he has made should encourage him to advance, and domestic examples are 				powerful excitements to urge him forward. Accordingly, he sets before him <i>his grandmother Lois and his mother Eunice, </i>by whom he had been educated from his infancy in such a manner that he might have sucked godliness along with his milk. By this godly education, therefore, Timothy is admonished not to degenerate from himself and from his ancestors.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p24"></a>It is uncertain whether, on the one hand, these women were converted to Christ, and what Paul here applauds was the commencement of faith, or whether, on the other hand, faith is attributed to them apart from Christianity. The latter appears to me more probable; for, although at that time everything abounded with many superstitions and corruptions, yet God had always his own people, whom he did not suffer to be corrupted with the 				multitude, but whom he sanctified and separated to himself, that there might always exist among the Jews a pledge of this grace, which he had promised to the seed of Abraham. There is, therefore, no absurdity in saying that they lived and died in the faith of the Mediator, although Christ had not yet been revealed to them. But I do not assert anything, and could not assert without rashness.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ii-p25"></a><i>And I am persuaded that in thee also</i> This clause confirms me in the conjecture which I have just now stated; for, in my opinion, he does not here speak of the present faith of Timothy. It would lessen that sure confidence of the former eulogium, if he only said that he reckoned the faith of Timothy to resemble the faith of his grandmother and mother. But I understand the 				meaning to be, that Timothy, from his childhood, while he had not yet obtained a knowledge of the gospel, was imbued with the fear of God, and with such faith as proved to be a living seed, which afterwards manifested itself.</p>  <a name="iv.ii.iii"></a>  			  				 				     				  
 <p class="TableCaption15"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p1"></a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2001.htm#006">2 Timothy 1:6-12</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p1.1"></a></p>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p16"></a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p16.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p17"></a><b>6</b> <i>For which cause I advise thee</i> The more abundantly that Timothy had received the grace of God, the more attentive (the Apostle intimates) he ought to be in making progress from day to day. It deserves notice that the words “for which cause” introduce this advice as a conclusion from what has been already 				said.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p18"></a><i>To stir up the gift of God</i>. This exhortation is highly necessary; for it usually happens, and may be said to be natural, that the excellence of gifts produces carelessness, which is also accompanied by sloth; and Satan continually labors to extinguish all that is of God in us. We ought, therefore, on the other hand, to strive to bring to perfection everything that is good in us, and to kindle 				what is languid; for the metaphor, which Paul employs, is taken from a fire which was feeble, or that was in course of being gradually extinguished, if strength and flame were not added, by blowing upon it and by supplying new fuel. Let us therefore remember that we ought to apply to use the gifts of God, lest, being unemployed and concealed, they gather rust. Let us also remember that we should diligently profit by them, lest they be extinguished by our slothfulness.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p19"></a><i>Which is in thee by the laying on of my hands</i> There can be no doubt that Timothy was invited by the general voice of the Church, and was not elected by the private wish of Paul alone; but there is no absurdity in saying, that Paul ascribes the election to himself personally, because he was the chief actor in it. Yet here he speaks of ordination, that is, of the solemn 				act of conferring the office of the ministry, and not of election. Besides, it is not perfectly clear whether it was the custom, when any minister was to be set apart, that all laid their hands on his head, or that one only did so, in the room and name of all. I am more inclined to the conjecture, that it was only one person who laid on his hands.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p20"></a>So far as relates to the ceremony, the apostles borrowed it from an ancient custom of their nation; or rather, in consequence of its being in use, they retained it; for this is a part of that decent and orderly procedure which Paul elsewhere recommends. (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p20.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#040">1Co 14:40</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p20.1"></a>.) Yet it may be doubted if that “laying on of hands” which is now 				mentioned refers to ordination; because, at that time, the graces of the Spirit, of which he speaks in the 12th chapter of the Epistle to the Romans (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p20.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#000">Ro 12</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p20.2"></a>), and in the 13th of the First Epistle to the Corinthians (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p20.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1013.htm#000">1Co 13</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p20.3"></a>), were bestowed on many others who were not appointed to be pastors. But, for my own 				part, I think that it may be easily inferred from the former Epistle, that Paul here speaks of the office of a pastor, for this passage agrees with that,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p21"></a>“Do not neglect the grace which was given to thee with the laying on of the hands of the eldership.” (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#014">1Ti 4:14</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p21.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p22"></a>That point being settled, it is asked, “Was grace given by the outward sign?” To this question I answer, whenever ministers were ordained, they were recommended to God by the prayers of the whole Church, and in this manner grace from God was obtained for them by prayer, and was not given to them by virtue of the sign, although the sign was not uselessly or unprofitably employed, but was a sure pledge of that grace which they received 				from God’s own hand. That ceremony was not a profane act, invented for the sole purpose of procuring credit in the eyes of men, but a lawful consecration before God, which is not performed but by the power of the Holy Spirit. Besides, Paul takes the sign for the whole matter or the whole transaction; for he declares that Timothy was endued with grace, when he was offered to God as a minister. Thus in this mode of expression there is a figure of speech, in which a part is taken for the 				whole.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p23"></a>But we are again met by another question; for if it was only at his ordination that Timothy obtained the grace necessary for discharging his office, of what nature was the election of a man not yet fit or qualified, but hitherto void and destitute of the gift of God? I answer, it was not then so given to him that he had it not before; for it is certain that he excelled both in doctrine and in other gifts before Paul ordained him to the 				ministry. But there is no inconsistency in saying, that, when God wished to make use of his services, and accordingly called him, he then fitted and enriched him still more with new gifts, or doubled those which he had previously bestowed. It does not therefore follow that Timothy had not formerly any gift, but it shone forth the more when the duty of teaching was laid upon him.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p24"></a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p24.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p25"></a><b>7</b> <i>For God hath not given to us a spirit of cowardice</i> It is a confirmation of what he had said immediately before; and thus he continues to urge Timothy to display the power of the gifts which he had received. He makes use of this argument, that God governs his ministers by <i>the Spirit of 				power, </i>which is the opposite of <i>cowardice. </i>Hence it follows, that they ought not to lie down through slothfulness, but, sustained by great confidence and cheerfulness, should exhibit and display, by visible effects, that power of the Spirit.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p26"></a>The following passage occurs in the Epistle to the Romans:</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p27"></a>“For we have not received a spirit of bondage, to be again in terror; but we have received the spirit of adoption, by which we cry, Abba, Father.” (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#015">Ro 8:15</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p27.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p28"></a>That passage is, at first sight, nearly similar to this; but yet the context shews that the meaning is different. There he treats of the confidence of adoption which all believers have; but here he speaks particularly about ministers, and exhorts them, in the person of Timothy, to arouse themselves actively to deeds of valor; because God does not wish them to perform their office in a cold and lifeless manner, but to press forward 				powerfully, relying on the efficacy of the Spirit.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p29"></a><i>But of power, and of love, and of soberness</i> Hence we are taught, first, that not one of us possesses that firmness and unshaken constancy of the Spirit, which is requisite for fulfilling our ministry, until we are endued from heaven with a new power. And indeed the obstructions are so many and so great, that no courage of man will be able to overcome them. It is God, 				therefore, who endues us with “the spirit of power;” for they who, in other respects, give tokens of much strength, fall down in a moment, when they are not upheld by the power of the Divine Spirit.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p30"></a>Secondly, we gather from it, that they who have slavish meanness and cowardice, so that they do not venture to do anything in defense of the truth, when it is necessary, are not governed by that Spirit by whom the servants of Christ are guided. Hence it follows, that there are very few of those who bear the title of ministers, in the present day, who have the mark of sincerity impressed upon them; for, amongst a vast number, where do we 				find one who, relying on the power of the Spirit, boldly despises all the loftiness which exalts itself against Christ? Do not almost all seek their own interest and their leisure? Do they not sink down dumb as soon as any noise breaks out? The consequence is, that no majesty of God is seen in their ministry. The word <i>Spirit </i>is here employed figuratively, as in many other passages.  				 <a name="fr_139"></a><a href="#fn_139"><font size="1">140</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p32"></a>But why did he afterwards add <i>love </i>and <i>soberness? </i>In my opinion, it was for the purpose of distinguishing that power of the Spirit from the fury and rage of fanatics, who while they rush forward with reckless impulse, fiercely boast of having the Spirit of God. For that reason he expressly states that this powerful energy is moderated by “soberness and love,” that is, by a calm desire of edifying. Yet Paul does not 				deny that prophets and teachers were endued with the same Spirit before the publication of the gospel; but he declares that this grace ought now to be especially powerful and conspicuous under the reign of Christ.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p33"></a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p33.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p34"></a><b>8</b> <i>Be not ashamed, therefore</i> He said this, because the confession of the gospel was accounted infamous; and therefore he forbids that either ambition or the fear of disgrace shall prevent or retard him from the liberty of preaching the gospel. And he infers this from what has been already said; for he who is armed with 				the power of God will not tremble at the noise raised by the world, but will reckon it honorable that wicked men mark them with disgrace.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p35"></a>And justly does he call the gospel <i>the testimony of our Lord;</i> because, although he has no need of our assistance, yet he lays upon us this duty, that we shall give “testimony” to him for maintaining his glory. It is a great and distinguished honor which he confers upon us, and, indeed, upon all, (for there is no Christian that ought not to reckon 				himself a witness of Christ,) but chiefly pastors and teachers, as Christ said to the apostles, —</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p36"></a>“Ye shall be witnesses to me,” (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p36.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#008">Ac 1:8</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p36.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p37"></a>Accordingly, the more hateful the doctrine of the gospel is in the world, the more earnestly should they labor to confess it openly.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p38"></a>When he adds, <i>nor of me</i>; by this word he reminds Timothy not to refuse to be his companion, as in a cause common to both of them; for, when we begin to withdraw from the society of those who, for the name of Christ, suffer persecution, what else do we seek than that the gospel shall be free from all persecution? Now, though there were not wanting many wicked men who thus 				ridiculed Timothy, — “Do you not see what has befallen your master? Do you not know that the same reward awaits you also? Why do you press upon us a doctrine which you see is hissed at by the whole world?” — still he must have been cheered by this exhortation, — “You have no reason to be ashamed of me, in that which is not shameful, for I am <i>Christ’s prisoner;” </i>that is, “Not for any crime or evil deed, but for his name I am kept in 				prison.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p39"></a><i>But be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel</i> He lays down a method by which that which he enjoins may be done; that is, if Timothy shall prepare himself for enduring the afflictions which are connected with the gospel. Whosoever shall revolt at and shrink from the cross will always be ashamed of the gospel. Not without good reason, therefore, does Paul, while 				he exhorts to boldness of confession, in order that he may not exhort in vain, speak to him also about bearing the cross.   				 <a name="fr_140"></a><a href="#fn_140"><font size="1">141</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p41"></a>He adds, <i>according to the power of God; </i>because, but for this, and if he did not support us, we should immediately sink under the load. And this clause contains both admonition and consolation. The admonition is, to turn away his eyes from his present weakness, and, relying on the assistance of God, to venture and undertake what is beyond his 				strength. The consolation is, that, if we endure anything on account of the gospel, God will come forth as our deliverer, that by his power, we may obtain the victory.</p>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p43"></a><b>9</b> <i>Who hath saved us</i> From the greatness of the benefit he shews how much we owe to God; for the salvation which he has bestowed on us easily swallows up all the evils that must be endured in this world. The word <i>saved,</i> though it admit of a general 				signification, is here limited, by the context, to denote eternal salvation. So then he means that they who, having obtained through Christ not a fading or transitory, but an eternal salvation, shall spare their fleeting life or honor rather than acknowledge their Redeemer; are excessively ungrateful.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p44"></a><i>And hath called us with a holy calling</i> He places the sealing of salvation   				 <a name="fr_141"></a><a href="#fn_141"><font size="1">142</font></a>
  				 in the <i>calling; </i>for, as the salvation of men was completed in the death of Christ, so God, by the gospel, makes us partakers of it. In order to place in a stronger light the value of this “calling,” he pronounces it to be <i>holy. </i>This ought to be carefully observed, because, as salvation must not be sought anywhere but in Christ; so, on the 				other hand, he would have died and risen again without any practical advantage, unless so far as he calls us to a participation of this grace. Thus, after having procured salvation for us, this second blessing remains to be bestowed, that, ingrafting us into his body, he may communicate his benefits to be enjoyed by us.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p46"></a><i>Not according to our works, but according to his purpose and grace</i>  He describes the source both of our calling and of the whole of our salvation. We had not works by which we could anticipate God; but the whole depends on his gracious purpose and election; for in the two words <i>purpose </i>and <i>grace 				</i>there is the figure of speech called Hypallage,   				 <a name="fr_142"></a><a href="#fn_142"><font size="1">143</font></a>
  				 and the latter must have the force of an objection, as if he had said, — “according to his gracious purpose.” Although Paul commonly employs the word “purpose” to denote the secret decree of God, the cause of which is in his own power, yet, for the sake of fuller explanation, he chose to add “grace,” that he might more clearly exclude all reference to works. And the very contrast proclaims loudly enough that there is no room for works where the grace of God 				reigns, especially when we are reminded of the election of God, by which he was beforehand with us, when we had not yet been born. On this subject I have spoken more fully in my exposition of the first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians; and at present I do nothing more than glance briefly at that which I have there treated more at large.   				 <a name="fr_143"></a><a href="#fn_143"><font size="1">144</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p49"></a><i>Which was given to us</i> From the order of time he argues, that, by free grace, salvation was given to us which we did not at all deserve; for, if God chose us before the creation of the world, he could not have regard to works, of which we had none, seeing that we did not then exist. As to the cavil of the sophists, that God was moved by the works which he foresaw, it 				does not need a long refutation. What kind of works would those have been if God had passed us by, seeing that the election itself is the source and beginning of all good works?</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p50"></a>This <i>giving</i> of grace, which he mentions, is nothing else than predestination, by which we were adopted to be the sons of God. On this subject I wished to remind my readers, because God is frequently said actually to “give” his grace to us when we receive the effect of it. But here Paul sets before us what God purposed with himself from the beginning. He, therefore, gave that which, not induced by any merit, he appointed to those 				who were not yet born, and kept laid up in his treasures, until he made known by the fact itself that he purposeth nothing in vain.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p51"></a><i>Before eternal ages</i> He employs this phrase in the same sense in which he elsewhere speaks of the uninterrupted succession of years from the foundation of the world. (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p51.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002">Titus 1:2</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p51.1"></a>.) For that ingenious reasoning which Augustine conducts in many passages is totally 				different from Paul’s design. The meaning therefore is, — “Before times began to take their course from all past ages.” Besides, it is worthy of notice, that he places the foundation of salvation in Christ; for, apart from him, there is neither adoption nor salvation; as was indeed said in expounding the first chapter of the Epistle to the Ephesians.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p52"></a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p52.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p53"></a><b>10</b> <i>But hath now been revealed by the appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ</i> Observe how appropriately he connects the faith which we have from the gospel within God’s secret election, and assigns to each of them its own place. God has now called us by the gospel, not because he has suddenly taken counsel about our 				salvation, but because he had so determined from all eternity. Christ hath now “appeared”   				 <a name="fr_144"></a><a href="#fn_144"><font size="1">145</font></a>
  				 for our salvation, not because the power of saving has been recently bestowed on him, but because this grace was laid up in him for us before the creation of the world. The knowledge of those things is revealed to us by faith; and so the Apostle judiciously connects the gospel with the most ancient promises of God, that novelty may not render it contemptible.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p55"></a>But it is asked; “Were the fathers under the Law ignorant of this grace?” for if it was not revealed but by the coming of Christ, it follows that, before that time, it was concealed. I reply, Paul speaks of the full exhibition of the thing itself on which depended also the faith of the fathers, so that this takes nothing from them. The reason why Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, David, and all believers, obtained the same faith with us, was, 				that they placed their confidence in this “appearance.” Thus, when he says that “grace hath been revealed to us by the appearing of Christ,” he does not exclude from communion with that grace the fathers who are made partakers with us of this appearing by the same faith. Christ (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p55.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#008">Heb 13:8</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p55.1"></a>) was yesterday as he is today; but he did not manifest himself to us, by his death and resurrection, before the time 				appointed by the Father. To this, as the only pledge and accomplishment of our salvation, both our faith and that of the fathers look with one accord.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p56"></a><i>Who hath indeed destroyed death</i> When he ascribes to the gospel the manifestation of life, he does not mean that we must begin with the word, leaving out of view the death and resurrection of Christ, (for the word, on the contrary, rests on the subject-matter,) but he only means that the fruit of this grace comes to men in no other way than by the gospel, in accordance 				with what is said,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p57"></a>“God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, and hath committed to us the ministry of reconciliation.”<br> 				(<a name="iv.ii.iii-p57.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#019">2Co 5:19</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p57.2"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p58"></a><i>And hath brought to light life and immortality by the gospel</i> It is a high and remarkable commendation of the gospel, that it “bringeth life to light.” To <i>life </i>he adds <i>immortality; </i>as if he had said, “a true and immortal life.” But, perhaps, it may 				be thought better, that by <i>life </i>we understand regeneration, that is followed by a blessed <i>immortality </i>which is also the object of hope. And, indeed, this is our “life,” not that which we have in common with brute beasts, but that which consists in partaking of the image of God. But because in this world</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p59"></a>“it doth not appear” (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p59.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#002">1Jo 3:2</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p59.1"></a>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p60"></a>what is the nature, or what is the value of that “life,” for the sake of more full expression he has most properly added, “immortality,” which is the revelation of that life which is now concealed.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p61"></a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p61.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p62"></a><b>11</b> <i>To which I have been appointed</i> Not without good reason does he so highly commend the gospel along with his apostleship. Satan labors, beyond all things else, to banish from our hearts, by every possible method, the faith of sound doctrine; and as it is not always easy for him to do this if he attack us in open war, 				he steals upon us by secret and indirect methods; for, in order to destroy the credibility of doctrine, he holds up to suspicion the calling of godly teachers.   				 <a name="fr_145"></a><a href="#fn_145"><font size="1">146</font></a>
  				 Paul, therefore, having death before his eyes, and knowing well the ancient and ordinary snares of Satan, determined to assert not only the doctrine of the gospel in general, but his own calling. Both were necessary; for, although there be uttered long discourses concerning the dignity of the gospel, they will not be of much avail to us, unless we understand what is the gospel. Many will agree as to the general 				principle of the undoubted authority of the gospel, who afterwards will have nothing certain that they can follow. This is the reason why Paul expressly wishes to be acknowledged to be a faithful and lawful minister of that life-giving doctrine which he had mentioned.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p64"></a><i>A herald, and an apostle, and a teacher of the Gentiles</i> For the reasons now stated, he adorns himself with various titles for expressing one and the same thing. He calls himself a <i>herald, </i>whose duty it is, to publish the commands of princes and magistrates. The word <i>apostle </i>is here used in its ordinary and restricted meaning. Moreover, because there is a natural relation between a <i>teacher </i>and his disciples, he takes to himself also this third name, that they who learn from him may know that they have a master who has been appointed to them by God. And to whom does he declare that he was appointed? To the <i>Gentiles; 				</i>for the main hinge of the controversy was about them, because the Jews denied that the promises of life belonged to any others than to the fleshly children of Abraham. In order, therefore, that the salvation of the Gentiles may not be called in question, he affirms that to them he has been especially sent by God.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p65"></a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p65.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p66"></a><b>12</b> <i> For which cause also I suffer these things</i> It is well known that the rage of the Jews was kindled against Paul, for this reason more than any other, that he made the gospel common to the Gentiles. Yet the phrase <i>for which cause </i>relates to the whole verse, and 				therefore must not be limited to the last clause about “the Gentiles.”</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p67"></a><i>But I am not ashamed</i> That the prison in which he was bound might not in any degree lessen his authority, he contends, on the contrary, by two arguments. First, he shows that the cause, far from being disgraceful, was even honorable to him; for he was a prisoner, not on account of any evil deed, but because he obeyed God who called him. It is an inconceivable 				consolation, when we are able to bring a good conscience in opposition to the unjust judgments of men. Secondly, from the hope of a prosperous issue he argues that there is nothing disgraceful in his imprisonment. He who shall avail himself of this defense will be able to overcome any temptations, however great they may be. And when he says, that he “is not ashamed,” he stimulates others, by his example, to have the same courage.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p68"></a><i>For I know whom I have believed</i> This is the only place of refuge, to which all believers ought to resort, whenever the world reckons them to be condemned and ruined men; namely, to reckon it enough that God approves of them; for what would be the result, if they depended on men? And hence we ought to infer how widely faith differs from opinion; because, when Paul says, 				“I know whom I have believed,” he means that it is not enough if you believe, unless you have the testimony of God, and unless you have full certainty of it. Faith, therefore, neither leans on the authority of men, nor rests on God, in such a manner as to hesitate, but must be joined with knowledge; otherwise it would not be sufficiently strong against the innumerable assaults of Satan. He who with Paul enjoys this knowledge, will know, by experience, that, on good grounds, our faith is 				called</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p69"></a>“the victory that overcometh the world,” (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p69.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1005.htm#004">1Jo 5:4</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p69.1"></a>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p70"></a>and that on good grounds, it was said by Christ,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p71"></a>“The gates of hell shall not prevail against it.”<br> 				(<a name="iv.ii.iii-p71.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018">Mt 16:18</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p71.2"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p72"></a>Amidst every storm and tempest, that man will enjoy undisturbed repose, who has a settled conviction that God,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p73"></a>“who cannot lie,” (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p73.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#002">Titus 1:2</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p73.1"></a>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p74"></a>or deceive, hath spoken, and will undoubtedly perform what he hath promised. On the other hand, he who has not this truth sealed on his heart, will be continually shaken hither and thither like a reed.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p75"></a>This passage is highly worthy of attention; because it expresses admirably the power of faith, when it shows that, even in desperate affairs, we ought to give to God such glory as not to doubt that he will be true and faithful; and when it likewise shows that we ought to rely on the word as fully as if God had manifested himself to us from heaven; for he who has not this conviction understands nothing. Let us always remember that Paul 				does not pursue philosophical speculations in the shade, but, having the reality before his eyes, solemnly declares, how highly valuable is a confident hope of eternal life.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p76"></a><i>And am persuaded that he is able</i> Because the power and greatness of dangers often fill us with dismay, or at least tempt our hearts to distrust, for this reason we must defend ourselves with this shield, that there is sufficient protection in the power of God. In like manner Christ, when he bids us cherish confident hope, employs this argument,</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p77"></a>“The Father, who gave you to me, is greater than all,”<br> 				(<a name="iv.ii.iii-p77.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#029">Joh 10:29</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p77.2"></a>)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p78"></a>by which he means, that we are out of danger, seeing that the Lord, who hath taken us under his protection, is abundantly powerful to put down all opposition. True, Satan does not venture to suggest this thought in a direct form, that God cannot fulfill, or is prevented from fulfilling, what he has promised, (for our senses are shocked by so gross a blasphemy against God,) but, by preoccupying our eyes and understandings, he takes away 				from us all sense of the power of God. The heart must therefore be well purified, in order that it may not only taste that power, but may retain the taste of it amidst temptations of every kind.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p79"></a>Now, whenever Paul speaks of the power of God, understand by it what may be called his actual or (ἐνεργουμένμν) “effectual” power, as he calls it elsewhere. (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p79.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#029">Col 1:29</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p79.1"></a>) Faith always connects the power of God with the word, which it does not imagine to 				be at a distance, but, having inwardly conceived it, possesses and retains it. Thus it is said of Abraham:</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iii-p80"></a>“He did not hesitate or dispute, but gave glory to God, being fully convinced that what he had promised he was able also to perform,” (<a name="iv.ii.iii-p80.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#020">Rom. 4:20</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#021">21</a><a name="iv.ii.iii-p80.1"></a>.)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iii-p81"></a><i>What I have intrusted to him</i> Observe that he employs this phrase to denote eternal life; for hence we conclude, that our salvation is in the hand of God, in the same manner as there are in the hand of a depository those things which we deliver to him to keep, relying on his fidelity. If our salvation depended on ourselves,   				 <a name="fr_146"></a><a href="#fn_146"><font size="1">147</font></a>
  				 to how many dangers would it be continually exposed? But now it is well that, having been committed to such a guardian, it is out of all danger.</p>  <a name="iv.ii.iv"></a>

 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p15"></a><b>13</b> <i>Hold the form of sound words</i> Some explain it thus: “Let thy doctrine be, as it were, a pattern which others may imitate.” I do not approve of that view. Equally removed from Paul’s meaning is Chrysostom’s exposition, that Timothy should have at hand the image of virtues engraven on his heart by Paul’s doctrine. I 				rather think that Paul commands Timothy to hold fast the doctrine which he had learned, not only as to substance, but as to the very form of expression; for ὑποτύπωσις — the word which Paul employs on this occasion — denotes a lively picture of objects, as if they were actually placed before the eyes. Paul knew how ready men are to depart or fall off from pure doctrine. For this reason he earnestly cautions Timothy not to turn aside from that 				form of teaching which he had received, and to regulate his manner of teaching by the rule which had been laid down; not that we ought to be very scrupulous about words, but because to misrepresent doctrine, even in the smallest degree, is exceedingly injurious.   				 <a name="fr_147"></a><a href="#fn_147"><font size="1">148</font></a>
 </p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p17"></a>Hence we see what kind of theology there is in Popery, which has degenerated so far from the pattern which Paul recommends, that it resembles the riddles of diviners or soothsayers rather than a doctrine taken from the word of God. What taste of Paul’s writings, I ask, is there in all the books of the schoolmen? This licentiousness in corrupting doctrine shews that there are great reasons why Paul invites Timothy to hold fast the original 				and natural form. And he contrasts <i>sound words </i>not only with doctrines manifestly wicked, but within useless questions, which, instead of health, bring nothing but disease.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p18"></a><i>In faith and love, which is in Christ Jesus</i> I am aware that the preposition ἐν, agreeably to the idiom of the Hebrew language, <a name="iv.ii.iv-p18.1"></a>ב is often taken for <i>with; </i>but here, 				I think, the meaning is different Paul has added this as a mark of sound doctrine, in order that we may know what it contains, and what is the summary of it, the whole of which, according to his custom, he includes under “faith and love.” He places both of them <i>in Christ; </i>as, indeed, the knowledge of Christ consists chiefly of these two parts; for, although the words, <i>which is, </i>are in the 				singular number, agreeing with the word <i>love, </i>yet it must also be understood as applying <i>to faith.</i></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p19"></a>Those who translate it, “<i>with </i>faith and love,” make the meaning to be, that Timothy should add to sound doctrine the affections of piety and love. I do acknowledge that no man can persevere faithfully in sound doctrine unless he is endued with true faith and unfeigned love. But the former exposition, in my opinion, is more appropriate, namely, that Paul employs these terms for describing more fully what is the nature of “sound 				words” and what is the subject of them. Now he says that the summary consists in “faith and love” of which the knowledge of Christ is the source and beginning.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p20"></a><a name="iv.ii.iv-p20.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p21"></a><b>14</b> <i>Keep the excellent thing committed to thee</i> This exhortation is more extensive than the preceding. He exhorts Timothy to consider what God has given to him, and to bestow care and application in proportion to the high value of that which has been committed; for, when the thing is of little value, we are not wont to 				call any one to so strict an account.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p22"></a>By “that which hath been committed,” I understand him to mean both the honor of the ministry and all the gifts with which Timothy was endued. Some limit it to the ministry alone; but I think that it denotes chiefly the qualifications for the ministry, that is, all the gifts of the Spirit, in which he excelled. The word “committed” is employed also for another reason, to remind Timothy that he must, one day, render an account; for we ought 				to administer faithfully what God has committed to us.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p23"></a>Τὸ Καλόν   				 <a name="fr_148"></a><a href="#fn_148"><font size="1">149</font></a>
  				 denotes that which is of high or singular value; and, therefore, Erasmus has happily translated it (<a name="iv.ii.iv-p24.2"></a><i>egregium</i>) “excellent,” for the sake of denoting its rare worth. I have followed that version. But what is the method of keeping it? It is this. We must beware lest we lose by our indolence what God has bestowed upon us, or lest it be taken away, because we 				have been ungrateful or have abused it; for there are many who reject the grace of God, and many who, after having received it, deprive themselves of it altogether. Yet because the difficulty of keeping it is beyond our strength, he therefore adds, —</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p25"></a><i>By the Holy Spirit</i> As if he had said, “I do ask from thee more than thou canst, for what thou hast not from thyself the Spirit of God will supply to thee.” Hence it follows, that we must not judge of the strength of men from the commandments of God; because, as he commands by words, so he likewise engraves his words on our hearts, and, by communicating strength, causes 				that his command shall not be in vain.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p26"></a><i>Who dwelleth in us</i>    				 <a name="fr_149"></a><a href="#fn_149"><font size="1">150</font></a>
  				 By this he means, that the assistance of the Holy Spirit is present to believers, provided that they do not reject it when it is offered to them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p28"></a><a name="iv.ii.iv-p28.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p29"></a><b>15</b> <i> Thou knowest that all that are in Asia have forsaken me</i> Those apostasies which he mentions might have shaken the hearts of many, and given rise, at the same time, to many suspicions; as we commonly look at everything in the worst light. Paul meets scandals of this kind with courage and heroism, that all good men may 				learn to abhor the treachery of those who had thus deserted the servant of Christ, when he alone, at the peril of his life, was upholding the common cause; and that they may not on that account give way, when they learn that Paul is not left destitute of divine assistance.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p30"></a><i>Of whom are Phygellus and Hermogenes</i> He names two of them, who were probably more celebrated than the rest, that he may shut the door against their slanders; for it is customary with revolters and deserters from the Christian warfare,   				 <a name="fr_150"></a><a href="#fn_150"><font size="1">151</font></a>
  				 in order to excuse their own baseness, to forge as many accusations as they can against the good and faithful ministers of the gospel. “Phygellus and Hermogenes,” knowing that their cowardice was justly reckoned infamous by believers, and that they were even condemned as guilty of base treachery, would not have hesitated to load Paul with false accusations, and impudently to attack his innocence. Paul, therefore, in order to take away all credit from their lies, 				brands them with the mark which they deserve.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p32"></a>Thus also, in the present day, there are many who, because they are not here admitted into the ministry, or are stripped of the honor on account of their wickedness,  				 <a name="fr_151"></a><a href="#fn_151"><font size="1">152</font></a>
  				or because we do not choose to support them while they do nothing, or because they have committed theft or fornication, are compelled to fly, and forthwith wander through France and other countries, and, by throwing upon us all the accusations  				 <a name="fr_152"></a><a href="#fn_152"><font size="1">153</font></a>
  				that they can, borrow from them an attestation of their innocence. And some brethren are so silly as to accuse us of cruelty, if any of us paints such persons in their true colors. But it were to be wished that all of them had their forehead marked with a hot iron, that they might be recognized at first sight.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p35"></a><a name="iv.ii.iv-p35.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p36"></a><b>16</b> <i>May the Lord grant mercy</i> From this prayer we infer, that the good offices done to the saints are not thrown away, even though they cannot recompense them; for, when he prays to God to reward them, this carries in it the force of a promise. At the same time, Paul testifies his gratitude, by desiring that God will grant 				the remuneration, because he is unable to pay. What if he had possessed abundant means of remuneration? Undoubtedly he would have manifested that he was not ungrateful.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p37"></a><i>To the family of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me</i> It is worthy of attention, that although he praises the kindness of <i>Onesiphorus </i>alone, yet, on his account, he prays for mercy to the whole <i>family</i> Hence we infer, that “the blessing of God 				rests, not only on the head of the righteous man,” but on all his house. So great is the love of God toward his people, that it diffuses itself over all who are connected with them.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p38"></a><i>And was not ashamed of my chain</i>  This is a proof, not only of his liberality, but likewise of his zeal; seeing that he cheerfully exposed himself to danger and to the reproach of men, in order to assist Paul.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p39"></a><a name="iv.ii.iv-p39.1"></a></p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p40"></a><b>18</b> <i> May the Lord grant to him</i> Some explain it thus: — “May God grant to him that he may find mercy with Christ the Judge.” And, indeed, this is somewhat more tolerable than to interpret that passage in the writings of Moses:</p>  			 
 <p class="SCRIPTURE"><a name="iv.ii.iv-p41"></a>“The Lord rained fire from the Lord,” (<a name="iv.ii.iv-p41.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen019.htm#024">Ge 19:24</a><a name="iv.ii.iv-p41.1"></a>,)</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p42"></a>as meaning, — “The Father rained from the Son.”  				 <a name="fr_153"></a><a href="#fn_153"><font size="1">154</font></a>
  				Yet it is possible that strong feeling may have prompted Paul, as often happens, to make a superfluous repetition.</p>  			 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.iv-p44"></a><i>That he may find mercy with the Lord on that day</i>    				 <a name="fr_154"></a><a href="#fn_154"><font size="1">155</font></a>
  				 This prayer shews us how much richer a recompense awaits those who, without the expectation of an earthly reward, perform kind offices to the saints, than if they received it immediately from the hand of men. And what does he pray for? “That he may find mercy;” for he who hath been merciful to his neighbors will receive such mercy from God to himself. And if this promise does not powerfully animate and encourage us to the exercise of kindness, we are worse than 				stupid. Hence it follows, also, that when God rewards us, it is not on account of our merits or of any excellence that is in us; but that the best and most valuable reward which he bestows upon us is, when he pardons us, and shews himself to be, not a stern judge, but a kind and indulgent Father.</p>

 </p><p class="Footnote"><a name="iv.ii.i-p8"></a> “Although, in all that Paul has left us in writing, we must consider that it is God who speaks to us by the mouth of a mortal man, and that all his doctrine ought to be received with such authority and reverence as if God visibly appeared from heaven, yet still there is in this epistle a special object to be kept in view, that Paul, being in prison and perceiving his death to be at hand, wished to ratify his faith, as if he had sealed it with 					 his blood. So then, as often as we read this epistle, let the condition in which Paul was at that time come before our eyes, namely, that he was looking for nothing but to die for the testimony of the gospel (which he actually did) as its standard-bearer, in order to give us stronger assurance of his doctrine, and that will affect us in a more lively manner. Indeed, if we read this epistle carefully, we shall find that the Spirit of God has expressed himself in it in such a manner, with such 					 majesty and power, that we are constrained to be captivated and overwhelmed. For my own part, I know that this epistle has been more profitable to me than any other book of Scripture, and still is profitable to me every day; and if any person shall examine it carefully, there can be no doubt that he will experience the same effect. And if we desire to have a testimony of the truth of God, which pierces our heart, we may well fix on this epistle; for a man must be in a profound sleep, and 					 remarkably stupid, if God do not work in his soul, when he hears the doctrine that shall be drawn from it.”-<i>Fr.

And now, if the gospel brings afflictions, and if our Lord Jesus Christ wishes that what he endured in his person shall be fulfilled in his members, and that every day he shall be, as it were, crucified, is it lawful for us to withdraw from that condition? Since, therefore, all our hope lies in the gospel, and since we ought to lean upon it, let us ponder what Paul says, that we must lend support to our brethren, when we see that 					 they are assailed, that men trample them under their feet, spit in their face, and insult them, let us choose to be their companions for enduring the reproaches and base conduct of the world, rather than to be honored, to be in good reputation and credit, and yet to be estranged from those who suffer for the cause which we have in common with them.” — <i>Fr.

He does not say, “May the Lord grant that he may find favor at his coming, on the day of our redemption, when he shall appear again to judge the world!” But he says, “On that day;” as if he presented the Lord Jesus visibly, with his 					 angels. Paul did not speak those things coldly, or like a man, but he rose above all men, that he might be able to exclaim, “That day, that day!” And where is it? True, none of those who wish to be wise in themselves will take any pains to find it; for that saying must be fulfilled, — “Eye hath not seen, ears have not heard, neither hath entered into the heart of man, what God hath prepared for them that love him.” (<a name="iv.ii.iv-p45.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa064.htm#004">Isa 64:4</a><a name="iv.ii.iv-p45.1"></a>.) Let men task their powers to the utmost to know it, it will be to them a dark and mysterious thing, and they will not be able to approach to it. But when we shall embrace the promise which he hath given to us, and after having known that Christ, being risen from the dead, displayed his power, not for his own sake, but to gather together all his members, and to unite them to himself, then shall we be able truly to say, <i>That day.”-Fr.
