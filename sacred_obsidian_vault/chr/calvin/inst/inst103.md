 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Institutes of the Christian Religion</i>, by John Calvin, tr. Henry  Beveridge [1845], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="v.ii"></a> 		  <h2 align="center"><a name="v.ii-p0.1"></a>BOOK 2 </h2>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p1"></a>14. The knowledge of God the Redeemer is obtained from the fall of man, and from the material cause of redemption.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p2"></a>15. In the fall of man, we must consider what he ought to be, and what he may be.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p3"></a>16. For he was created after the image of God; that is, he was made a partaker of the divine Wisdom, Righteousness, and Holiness, and, being thus perfect in soul and in body, was bound to render to God a perfect obedience to his commandments.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p4"></a>17. The immediate causes of the fall were—Satan, the Serpent, Eve, the forbidden fruit; the remote causes were—unbelief, ambition, ingratitude, obstinacy. Hence followed the obliteration of the image of God in man, who became unbelieving, unrighteous, liable to death.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p5"></a>18. We must now see what he may be, in respect both of soul and of body. The understanding of the soul in divine things, that is, in the knowledge and true worship of God, is blinder than a mole; good works it can neither contrive nor perform. In human affairs, as in the liberal and mechanical arts, it is exceedingly blind and variable. Now the will, so far as regards divine things, chooses only what is evil. So far as regards lower and human affairs, it is uncertain, 			 wandering, and not wholly at its own disposal.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p6"></a>19. The body follows the depraved appetites of the soul, is liable to many infirmities, and at length to death.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p7"></a>20. Hence it follows that redemption for ruined man must be sought through Christ the Mediator; because the first adoption of a chosen people, the preservation of the Church, her deliverance from dangers, her recovery after dispersions, and the hope of the godly, always depended on the grace of the Mediator. Accordingly, the law was given, that it might keep their minds in suspense till the coming of Christ; which is evident from the history of a gracious covenant 			 frequently repeated, from ceremonies, sacrifices, and washings, from the end of adoption, and from the law of the priesthood.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p8"></a>21. The material cause of redemption is Christ, in whom we must consider three things; 1. How he is exhibited to men; 2. How he is received; 3. How men are retained in his fellowship.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p9"></a>22. Christ is exhibited to men by the Law and by the Gospel.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p10"></a>23. The Law is threefold: Ceremonial, Judicial, Moral. The use of the Ceremonial Law is repealed, its effect is perpetual. The Judicial or Political Law was peculiar to the Jews, and has been set aside, while that universal justice which is described in the Moral Law remains. The latter, or Moral Law, the object of which is to cherish and maintain godliness and righteousness, is perpetual, and is incumbent on all.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p11"></a>24. The use of the Moral Law is threefold. The first use shows our weakness, unrighteousness, and condemnation; not that we may despair, but that we may flee to Christ. The second is, that those who are not moved by promises, may be urged by the terror of threatenings. The third is, that we may know what is the will of God; that we may consider it in order to obedience; that our minds may be strengthened for that purpose; and that we may be kept from falling.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p12"></a>25. The sum of the Law is contained in the Preface, and in the two Tables. In the Preface we observe, 1. The power of God, to constrain the people by the necessity of obedience; 2. A promise of grace, by which he declares himself to be the God of the Church; 3. A kind act, on the ground of which he charges the Jews with ingratitude, if they do not requite his goodness.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p13"></a>26. The first Table, which relates to the worship of God, consists of four commandments.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p14"></a>27. The design of the First Commandment is, that God alone may be exalted in his people. To God alone, therefore, we owe adoration, trust, invocation, thanksgiving.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p15"></a>28. The design of the Second Commandment is, that God will not have his worship profaned by superstitious rites. It consists of two parts. The former restrains our licentious daring, that we may not subject God to our senses, or represent him under any visible shape. The latter forbids us to worship any images on religious grounds, and, therefore, proclaims his power, which he cannot suffer to be despised,—his jealousy, for he cannot bear a partner,—his vengeance on 			 children’s children,—his mercy to those who adore his majesty.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p16"></a>29. The Third Commandment enjoins three things: 1. That whatever our mind conceives, or our tongue utters, may have a regard to the majesty of God; 2. That we may not rashly abuse his holy word and adorable mysteries for the purposes of ambition or avarice; 3. That we may not throw obloquy on his works, but may speak of them with commendatians of his Wisdom, Long-suffering, Power, Goodness, Justice. With these is contrasted a threefold profanation of the name of God, by 			 perjury, unnecessary oaths, and idolatrous rites; that is, when we substitute in the place of God saints, or creatures animate or inanimate.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p17"></a>30. The design of the Fourth Commandment is, that, being dead to our own affections and works, we may meditate on the kingdom of God. Now there are three things here to be considered: 1. A spiritual rest, when believers abstain from their own works, that God may work in them; 2. That there may be a stated day for calling on the name of God, for hearing his word, and for performing religious rites; 3. That servants may have some remission from labour.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p18"></a>31. The Second Table, which relates to the duties of charity towards our neighbour, contains the last Six Commandments. The design of the Fifth Commandment is, that, since God takes pleasure in the observance of his own ordinance, the degrees of dignity appointed by him must be held inviolable. We are therefore forbidden to take anything from the dignity of those who are above us, by contempt, obstinacy, or ingratitude; and we are commanded to pay them reverence, 			 obedience, and gratitude.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p19"></a>32. The design of the Sixth Commandment is, that, since God has bound mankind by a kind of unity, the safety of all ought to be considered by each person; whence it follows that we are forbidden to do violence to private individuals, and are commanded to exercise benevolence.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p20"></a>33. The design of the Seventh Commandment is, that, because God loves purity, we ought to put away from us all uncleanness. He therefore forbids adultery in mind, word, and deed.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p21"></a>34. The design of the Eighth Commandment is, that, since injustice is an abomination to God, he requires us to render to every man what is his own. Now men steal, either by violence, or by malicious imposture, or by craft, or by sycophancy, &amp;c.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p22"></a>35. The design of the Ninth Commandment is, that, since God, who is truth, abhors falsehood, he forbids calumnies and false accusations, by which the name of our neighbour is injured,—and lies, by which any one suffers loss in his fortunes. On the other hand, he requires every one of us to defend the name and property of our neighbour by asserting the truth.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p23"></a>36. The design of the Tenth Commandment is, that, since God would have the whole soul pervaded by love, every desire averse to charity must be banished from our minds; and therefore every feeling which tends to the injury of another is forbidden.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p24"></a>37. We have said that Christ is revealed to us by the Gospel. And, first, the agreement between the Gospel, or the New Testament, and the Old Testament is demonstrated: 1. Because the godly, under both dispensations, have had the same hope of immortality; 2. They have had the same covenant, founded not on the works of men, but on the mercy of God; 3. They have had the same Mediator between God and men—Christ.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p25"></a>38. Next, five points of difference between the two dispensations are pointed out. 1. Under the Law the heavenly inheritance was held out to them under earthly blessings; but under the Gospel our minds are led directly to meditate upon it. 2. The Old Testament, by means of figures, presented the image only, while the reality was absent; but the New Testament exhibits the present truth. 3. The former, in respect of the Law, was the ministry of condemnation and death; the 			 latter, of righteousness and life. 4. The former is connected with bondage, which begets fear in the mind; the latter is connected with freedom, which produces confidence. 5. The word had been confined to the single nation of the Jews; but now it is preached to all nations.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p26"></a>39. The sum of evangelical doctrine is, to teach, 1. What Christ is; 2. Why he was sent; 3. In what manner he accomplished the work of redemption.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p27"></a>40. Christ is God and man: <i>God</i>, that he may bestow on his people righteousness, sanctification, and redemption; <i>Man</i>, because he had to pay the debt of man.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p28"></a>41. He was sent to perform the office, 1. Of a Prophet, by preaching the truth, by fulfilling the prophecies, by teaching and doing the will of his Father; 2. Of a King, by governing the whole Church and every member of it, and by defending his people from every kind of adversaries; 3. Of a Priest, by offering his body as a sacrifice for sins, by reconciling God to us though his obedience, and by perpetual intercession for his people to the Father.</p>  		  
 <p class="Body"><a name="v.ii-p29"></a>42. He performed the office of a Redeemer by dying for our sins, by rising again for our justification, by opening heaven to us through his ascension, by sitting at the right hand of the Father whence he will come to judge the quick and the dead; and, therefore, he procured for us the grace of God and salvation.</p>
