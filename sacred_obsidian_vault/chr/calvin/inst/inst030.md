 <p class="introHead"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p1"></a>THE WORLD, CREATED BY GOD, STILL CHERISHED AND PROTECTED BY HIM. EACH AND ALL OF ITS PARTS GOVERNED BY HIS PROVIDENCE.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p2"></a>The divisions of this chapter are, I. The doctrine of the special providence of God over all the creatures, singly and collectively, as opposed to the dreams of the Epicureans about fortune and fortuitous causes. II. The fiction of the Sophists concerning the omnipotence of God, and the error of philosophers, as to a confused and equivocal government of the world, sec. 1-5. All animals, but especially mankind, from the peculiar superintendence exercised over them, are 				proofs, evidences, and examples of the providence of God, sec. 6, 7. III. A consideration of fate, fortune, chance, contingence, and uncertain events (on which the matter here under discussion turns).</p>  			 
 <p class="introHead"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p3"></a><i>Sections.</i></p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p4"></a>1. Even the wicked, under the guidance of carnal sense, acknowledge that God is the Creator. The godly acknowledge not this only, but that he is a most wise and powerful governor and preserver of all created objects. In so doing, they lean on the Word of God, some passages from which are produced.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p5"></a>2. Refutation of the Epicureans, who oppose fortune and fortuitous causes to Divine Providence, as taught in Scripture. The sun, a bright manifestation of Divine Providence.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p6"></a>3. Figment of the Sophists as to an indolent Providence refuted. Consideration of the Omnipotence as combined with the Providence of God. Double benefit resulting from a proper acknowledgement of the Divine Omnipotence. Cavils of Infidelity.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p7"></a>4. A definition of Providence refuting the erroneous dogmas of Philosophers. Dreams of the Epicureans and Peripatetics.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p8"></a>5. Special Providence of God asserted and proved by arguments founded on a consideration of the Divine Justice and Mercy. Proved also by passages of Scripture, relating to the sky, the earth, and animals.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p9"></a>6. Special Providence proved by passages relating to the human race, and the more especially that for its sake the world was created.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p10"></a>7. Special Providence proved, lastly, from examples taken from the history of the Israelites, of Jonah, Jacob, and from daily experience.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p11"></a>8. Erroneous views as to Providence refuted:—I. The sect of the Stoics. II. The fortune and chance of the Heathen.</p>  			 
 <p class="intro"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p12"></a>9. How things are said to be fortuitous to us, though done by the determinate counsel of God. Example. Error of separating contingency and event from the secret, but just, and most wise counsel of God. Two examples.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p13"></a>1. It were cold and lifeless to represent God as a momentary Creator, who completed his work once for all, and then left it. Here, especially, we must dissent from the profane, and maintain that the presence of the divine power is conspicuous, not less in the perpetual condition of the world then in its first creation. For, although even wicked men are forced, by the mere view of the earth and sky, to rise to the Creator, yet faith has a method of its own in assigning 				the whole praise of creation to God. To this effect is the passage of the Apostle already quoted that by faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the Word of God (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p13.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#003">Heb. 11:3</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p13.1"></a>); because, without proceeding to his Providence, we cannot understand the full force of what is meant by God being the Creator, how much soever we may seem to comprehend it with our mind, and confess it with our tongue. The carnal mind, when once it has perceived the power of God in the creation, stops there, and, 				at the farthest, thinks and ponders on nothing else than the wisdom, power, and goodness displayed by the Author of such a work (matters which rise spontaneously, and force themselves on the notice even of the unwilling), or on some general agency on which the power of motion depends, exercised in preserving and governing it. In short, it imagines that all things are sufficiently sustained by the energy divinely infused into them at first. But faith must penetrate deeper. After learning that 				there is a Creator, it must forthwith infer that he is also a Governor and Preserver, and that, not by producing a kind of general motion in the machine of the globe as well as in each of its parts, but by a special providence sustaining, cherishing, superintending, all the things which he has made, to the very minutest, even to a sparrow. Thus David, after briefly premising that the world was created by God, immediately descends to the continual course of Providence, “By the word of the Lord 				were the heavens framed, and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth;” immediately adding, “The Lord looketh from heaven, he beholdeth the children of men,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p13.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#006">Ps. 33:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa033.htm#013">13</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p13.2"></a>, &amp;c). He subjoins other things to the same effect. For although all do not reason so accurately, yet because it would not be credible that human affairs were superintended by God, unless he were the maker of the world, and no one could seriously believe that he is its Creator without feeling convinced that he takes 				care of his works; David with good reason, and in admirable order, leads us from the one to the other. In general, indeed, philosophers teach, and the human mind conceives, that all the parts of the world are invigorated by the secret inspiration of God. They do not, however reach the height to which David rises taking all the pious along with him, when he says, “These wait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season. That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine 				hand, they are filled with good. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth thy Spirit, they are created, and thou renewest the face of the earth,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p13.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#027">Ps. 104:27-30</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p13.3"></a>). Nay, though they subscribe to the sentiment of Paul, that in God “we live, and move, and have our being,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p13.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028">Acts 17:28</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p13.4"></a>), yet they are far from having a serious apprehension of the grace which he commends, because they have not the least relish for 				that special care in which alone the paternal favour of God is discerned.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p14"></a>2. That this distinction may be the more manifest, we must consider that the Providence of God, as taught in Scripture, is opposed to fortune and fortuitous causes. By an erroneous opinion prevailing in all ages, an opinion almost universally prevailing in our own day—viz. that all things happen fortuitously, the true doctrine of Providence has not only been obscured, but almost buried. If one falls among robbers, or ravenous beasts; if a sudden gust of wind at sea 				causes shipwreck; if one is struck down by the fall of a house or a tree; if another, when wandering through desert paths, meets with deliverance; or, after being tossed by the waves, arrives in port, and makes some wondrous hair-breadth escape from death—all these occurrences, prosperous as well as adverse, carnal sense will attribute to fortune. But whose has learned from the mouth of Christ that all the hairs of his head are numbered (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p14.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#030">Mt. 10:30</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p14.1"></a>), will look farther for the cause, and hold 				that all events whatsoever are governed by the secret counsel of God. With regard to inanimate objects again we must hold that though each is possessed of its peculiar properties, yet all of them exert their force only in so far as directed by the immediate hand of God. Hence they are merely instruments, into which God constantly infuses what energy he sees meet, and turns and converts to any purpose at his pleasure. No created object makes a more wonderful or glorious display than the sun. 				For, besides illuminating the whole world with its brightness, how admirably does it foster and invigorate all animals by its heat, and fertilise the earth by its rays, warming the seeds of grain in its lap, and thereby calling forth the verdant blade! This it supports, increases, and strengthens with additional nurture, till it rises into the stalk; and still feeds it with perpetual moisture, till it comes into flower; and from flower to fruit, which it continues to ripen till it attains 				maturity. In like manner, by its warmth trees and vines bud, and put forth first their leaves, then their blossom, then their fruit. And the Lord, that he might claim the entire glory of these things as his own, was pleased that light should exist, and that the earth should be replenished with all kinds of herbs and fruits before he made the sun. No pious man, therefore, will make the sun either the necessary or principal cause of those things which existed before the creation of the sun, but 				only the instrument which God employs, because he so pleases; though he can lay it aside, and act equally well by himself: Again, when we read, that at the prayer of Joshua the sun was stayed in its course (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p14.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos010.htm#013">Josh. 10:13</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p14.2"></a>); that as a favour to Hezekiah, its shadow receded ten degrees (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p14.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#011">2 Kings 20:11</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p14.3"></a>); by these miracles God declared that the sun does not daily rise and set by a blind instinct of nature, but is governed by Him in its course, that he may renew the remembrance of his paternal favour 				toward us. Nothing is more natural than for spring, in its turns to succeed winter, summer spring, and autumn summer; but in this series the variations are so great and so unequal as to make it very apparent that every single year, month, and day, is regulated by a new and special providence of God.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p15"></a>3. And truly God claims omnipotence to himself, and would have us to acknowledge it,—not the vain, indolent, slumbering omnipotence which sophists feign, but vigilant, efficacious, energetic, and ever active,—not an omnipotence which may only act as a general principle of confused motion, as in ordering a stream to keep within the channel once prescribed to it, but one which is intent on individual and special movements. God is deemed omnipotent, not because he can act 				though he may cease or be idle, or because by a general instinct he continues the order of nature previously appointed; but because, governing heaven and earth by his providence, he so overrules all things that nothing happens without his counsel. For when it is said in the Psalms, “He has done whatsoever he has pleased,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p15.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#003">Ps. 115:3</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p15.1"></a>), the thing meant is his sure and deliberate purpose. It were insipid to interpret the Psalmist’s words in philosophic fashion, to mean that God is the primary 				agent, because the beginning and cause of all motion. This rather is the solace of the faithful, in their adversity, that every thing which they endure is by the ordination and command of God, that they are under his hand. But if the government of God thus extends to all his works, it is a childish cavil to confine it to natural influx.13 				 <a name="fr_124"></a><a href="#fn_124"><font size="1">125</font></a>
  				Those moreover who confine the providence of God within narrow limits, as if he allowed all things to be borne along freely according to a perpetual law of nature, do not more defraud God of his glory than themselves of a most useful doctrine; for nothing were more wretched than man if he were exposed to all possible movements of the sky, the air, the earth, and the water. We may add, that by this view the singular goodness of God towards each individual is unbecomingly impaired. 				David exclaims (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p16.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#003">Ps. 8:3</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p16.1"></a>), that infants hanging at their mothers breasts are eloquent enough to celebrate the glory of God, because, from the very moment of their births they find an aliment prepared for them by heavenly care. Indeed, if we do not shut our eyes and senses to the fact, we must see that some mothers have full provision for their infants, and others almost none, according as it is the pleasure of God to nourish one child more liberally, and another more sparingly. Those who 				attribute due praise to the omnipotence of God thereby derive a double benefit. He to whom heaven and earth belong, and whose nod all creatures must obey, is fully able to reward the homage which they pay to him, and they can rest secure in the protection of Him to whose control everything that could do them harm is subject, by whose authority, Satan, with all his furies and engines, is curbed as with a bridle, and on whose will everything adverse to our safety depends. In this way, and in no 				other, can the immoderate and superstitious fears, excited by the dangers to which we are exposed, be calmed or subdued. I say superstitious fears. For such they are, as often as the dangers threatened by any created objects inspire us with such terror, that we tremble as if they had in themselves a power to hurt us, or could hurt at random or by chance; or as if we had not in God a sufficient protection against them. For example, Jeremiah forbids the children of God “ to be dismayed at the 				signs of heaven, as the heathen are dismayed at them,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p16.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#002">Jer. 10:2</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p16.2"></a>). He does not, indeed, condemn every kind of fear. But as unbelievers transfer the government of the world from God to the stars, imagining that happiness or misery depends on their decrees or presages, and not on the Divine will, the consequence is, that their fear, which ought to have reference to him only, is diverted to stars and comets. Let him, therefore, who would beware of such unbelief, always bear in mind, that there is 				no random power, or agency, or motion in the creatures, who are so governed by the secret counsel of God, that nothing happens but what he has knowingly and willingly decreed.13 				 <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">126</font></a>
  			</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p18"></a>4. First, then, let the reader remember that the providence we mean is not one by which the Deity, sitting idly in heaven, looks on at what is taking place in the world, but one by which he, as it were, holds the helms and overrules all events. Hence his providence extends not less to the hand than to the eye.13 				 <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">127</font></a>
  				When Abraham said to his son, <i>God will provide</i> (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p19.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#008">Gen. 22:8</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p19.1"></a>), he meant not merely to assert that the future event was foreknown to Gods but to resign the management of an unknown business to the will of Him whose province it is to bring perplexed and dubious matters to a happy result. Hence it appears that providence consists in action. What many talk of bare prescience is the merest trifling. Those do not err quite so grossly who attribute government to God, but still, as I 				have observed, a confused and promiscuous government which consists in giving an impulse and general movement to the machine of the globe and each of its parts, but does not specially direct the action of every creature. It is impossible, however, to tolerate this error. For, according to its abettors, there is nothing in this providence, which they call universal, to prevent all the creatures from being moved contingently, or to prevent man from turning himself in this direction or in that, 				according to the mere freedom of his own will. In this ways they make man a partner with God,—God, by his energy, impressing man with the movement by which he can act, agreeably to the nature conferred upon him while man voluntarily regulates his own actions. In short, their doctrine is, that the world, the affairs of men, and men themselves, are governed by the power, but not by the decree of God. I say nothing of the Epicureans (a pest with which the world has always been plagued), who dream 				of an inert and idle God,13 				 <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">128</font></a>
  				and others, not a whit sounder, who of old feigned that God rules the upper regions of the air, but leaves the inferior to Fortune. Against such evident madness even dumb creatures lift their voice.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p21"></a>My intention now is, to refute an opinion which has very generally obtained—an opinion which, while it concedes to God some blind and equivocal movement, withholds what is of principal moment—viz. the disposing and directing of every thing to its proper end by incomprehensible wisdom. By withholding government, it makes God the ruler of the world in name only, not in reality. For what, I ask, is meant by government, if it be not to preside so as to regulate the destiny 				of that over which you preside? I do not, however, totally repudiate what is said of an universal providence, provided, on the other hand, it is conceded to me that the world is governed by God, not only because he maintains the order of nature appointed by him, but because he takes a special charge of every one of his works. It is true, indeed, that each species of created objects is moved by a secret instinct of nature, as if they obeyed the eternal command of God, and spontaneously followed 				the course which God at first appointed. And to this we may refer our Saviour’s words, that he and his Father have always been at work from the beginning (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p21.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh005.htm#017">John 5:17</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p21.1"></a>); also the words of Paul, that “in him we live, and move, and have our being,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p21.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#028">Acts 17:28</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p21.2"></a>); also the words of the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, who, when wishing to prove the divinity of Christ, says, that he upholdeth “all things by the word of his power,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p21.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb. 1:3</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p21.3"></a>). But some, under pretext of the general, hide and 				obscure the special providence, which is so surely and clearly taught in Scripture, that it is strange how any one can bring himself to doubt of it. And, indeed, those who interpose that disguise are themselves forced to modify their doctrine, by adding that many things are done by the special care of God. This, however, they erroneously confine to particular acts. The thing to be proved, therefore, is, that single events are so regulated by God, and all events so proceed from his determinate 				counsel, that nothing happens fortuitously.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p22"></a>5. Assuming that the beginning of motion belongs to God, but that all things move spontaneously or casually, according to the impulse which nature gives, the vicissitudes of day and nights summer and winter, will be the work of God; inasmuch as he, in assigning the office of each, appointed a certain law, namely, that they should always with uniform tenor observe the same course, day succeeding night, month succeeding month, and year succeeding year. But, as at one 				time, excessive heat, combined with drought, burns up the fields; at another time excessive rains rot the crops, while sudden devastation is produced by tempests and storms of hail, these will not be the works of God, unless in so far as rainy or fair weather, heat or cold, are produced by the concourse of the stars, and other natural causes. According to this view, there is no place left either for the paternal favour, or the Judgments of God. If it is said that God fully manifests his 				beneficence to the human race, by furnishing heaven and earth with the ordinary power of producing food, the explanation is meagre and heathenish: as if the fertility of one year were not a special blessing, the penury and dearth of another a special punishment and curse from God. But as it would occupy too much time to enumerate all the arguments, let the authority of God himself suffice. In the Law and the Prophets he repeatedly declares, that as often as he waters the earth with dew and 				rain, he manifests his favour, that by his command the heaven becomes hard as iron, the crops are destroyed by mildew and other evils, that storms and hail, in devastating the fields, are signs of sure and special vengeance. This being admitted, it is certain that not a drop of rain falls without the express command of God. David, indeed (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p22.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa146.htm#009">Ps. 146:9</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p22.1"></a>), extols the general providence of God in supplying food to the young ravens that cry to him but when God himself threatens living creatures with 				famine, does he not plainly declare that they are all nourished by him, at one time with scanty, at another with more ample measure? It is childish, as I have already said, to confine this to particular acts, when Christ says, without reservation, that not a sparrow falls to the ground without the will of his Father (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p22.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#029">Mt. 10:29</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p22.2"></a>). Surely, if the flight of birds is regulated by the counsel of God, we must acknowledge with the prophet, that while he “dwelleth on high,” he “humbleth himself to 				behold the things that are in heaven and in the earth,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p22.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#005">Ps. 113:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa113.htm#006">6</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p22.3"></a>).</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p23"></a>6. But as we know that it was chiefly for the sake of mankind that the world was made, we must look to this as the end which God has in view in the government of it. The prophet Jeremiah exclaims, “O Lord, I know that the way of man is not in himself: it is not in man that walketh to direct his steps,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer010.htm#023">Jer. 10:23</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.1"></a>). Solomon again says, “Man’s goings are of the Lord: how can a man then understand his own way?” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro020.htm#024">Prov. 20:24</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.2"></a>). Will it now be said that man is moved by God 				according to the bent of his nature, but that man himself gives the movement any direction he pleases? Were it truly so, man would have the full disposal of his own ways. To this it will perhaps be answered, that man can do nothing without the power of God. But the answer will not avail, since both Jeremiah and Solomon attribute to God not power only, but also election and decree. And Solomon, in another place, elegantly rebukes the rashness of men in fixing their plans without reference to 				God, as if they were not led by his hand. “The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the tongue, is from the Lord,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#001">Prov. 16:1</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.3"></a>). It is a strange infatuation, surely for miserable men, who cannot even give utterance except in so far as God pleases, to begin to act without him! Scriptures moreover, the better to show that every thing done in the world is according to his decree, declares that the things which seem most fortuitous are subject to him. For what seems more attributable 				to chance than the branch which falls from a tree, and kills the passing traveller? But the Lord sees very differently, and declares that He delivered him into the hand of the slayer (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#013">Exod. 21:13</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.4"></a>). In like manners who does not attribute the lot to the blindness of Fortune? Not so the Lord, who claims the decision for himself (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro016.htm#033">Prov. 16:33</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.5"></a>). He says not, that by his power the lot is thrown into the lap, and taken out, but declares that the only thing which could be attributed to chance is from 				him. To the same effect are the words of Solomon, “The poor and the deceitful man meet together; the Lord lighteneth both their eyes,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro029.htm#013">Prov. 29:13</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.6"></a>). For although rich and poor are mingled together in the world, in saying that the condition of each is divinely appointed, he reminds us that God, Who enlightens all, has his own eye always open, and thus exhorts the poor to patient endurance, seeing that those who are discontented with their lot endeavour to shake off a burden which God has 				imposed upon them. Thus, too, another prophet upbraids the profane, who ascribe it to human industry, or to fortune, that some grovel in the mire while others rise to honour. “Promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south. But God is the judge: he putteth down ones and setteth up another,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#006">Ps. 75:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa075.htm#007">7</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p23.7"></a>). Because God cannot divest himself of the office of judge, he infers that to his secret counsel it is owing that some are elevated, while others remain without 				honour.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24"></a>7. Nay, I affirm in general, that particular events are evidences of the special providence of God. In the wilderness God caused a south wind to blow, and brought the people a plentiful supply of birds (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo019.htm#013">Exod. 19:13</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.1"></a>). When he desired that Jonah should be thrown into the sea, he sent forth a whirlwind. Those who deny that God holds the reins of government will say that this was contrary to ordinary practice, whereas I infer from it that no wind ever rises or rages 				without his special command. In no way could it be true that “he maketh the winds his messengers, and the flames of fire his ministers;” that “he maketh the clouds his chariot, and walketh upon the wings of the wind,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#003">Ps. 104:3</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa104.htm#004">4</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.2"></a>), did he not at pleasure drive the clouds and winds and therein manifest the special presence of his power. In like manner, we are elsewhere taught, that whenever the sea is raised into a storm, its billows attest the special presence of God. “He commandeth and 				raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth up the waves.” “He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are still,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#025">Ps. 107:25</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa107.htm#029">29</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.3"></a> ) He also elsewhere declares, that he had smitten the people with blasting and mildew (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#009">Amos 4:9</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.4"></a>). Again while man naturally possesses the power of continuing his species, God describes it as a mark of his special favour, that while some continue childless, others are blessed with offspring: for the fruit of the womb is his gift. Hence the words of Jacob to 				Rachel, “Am I in God’s stead, who has withheld from thee the fruit of the womb?” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.5"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#002">Gen. 30:2</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.5"></a>). To conclude in one word. Nothing in nature is more ordinary than that we should be nourished with bread. But the Spirit declares not only that the produce of the earth is God’s special gift, but “that man does not live by bread only,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.6"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003">Deut. 8:3</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.6"></a>), because it is not mere fulness that nourishes him but the secret blessing of God. And hence, on the other hand, he threatens to take away “the stay and the 				staff, the whole stay of bread, and the whole stay of water,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.7"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa003.htm#001">Is. 3:1</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.7"></a>). Indeed, there could be no serious meaning in our prayer for daily bread, if God did not with paternal hand supply us with food. Accordingly, to convince the faithful that God, in feeding them, fulfils the office of the best of parents, the prophet reminds them that he “giveth food to all flesh,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.8"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa136.htm#025">Ps. 136:25</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.8"></a>). In fine, when we hear on the one hand, that “the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous, and his ears are open 				unto their cry,” and, on the other hand, that “the face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth,” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.9"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#015">Ps. 34:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa034.htm#016">16</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p24.9"></a>), let us be assured that all creatures above and below are ready at his service, that he may employ them in whatever way he pleases. Hence we infer, not only that the general providence of God, continuing the order of nature, extends over the creatures, but that by his wonderful counsel they are adapted to a certain and special 				purpose.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p25"></a>8. Those who would cast obloquy on this doctrine, calumniate it as the dogma of the Stoics concerning fate. The same charge was formerly brought against Augustine (lib. ad Bonifac. 2, c. 6 et alibi). We are unwilling to dispute about words; but we do not admit the term Fate, both because it is of the class which Paul teaches us to shun, as profane novelties (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p25.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#020">1 Tim. 6:20</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p25.1"></a>), and also because it is attempted, by means of an odious term, to fix a stigma on the truth of God. 				But the dogma itself is falsely and maliciously imputed to us. For we do not with the Stoics imagine a necessity consisting of a perpetual chain of causes, and a kind of involved series contained in nature, but we hold that God is the disposer and ruler of all things,—that from the remotest eternity, according to his own wisdom, he decreed what he was to do, and now by his power executes what he decreed. Hence we maintain, that by his providence, not heaven and earth and inanimate creatures 				only, but also the counsels and wills of men are so governed as to move exactly in the course which he has destined. What, then, you will say, does nothing happen fortuitously, nothing contingently? I answer, it was a true saying of Basil the Great, that Fortune and Chance are heathen terms; the meaning of which ought not to occupy pious minds. For if all success is blessing from God, and calamity and adversity are his curse, there is no place left in human affairs for fortune and chance. We 				ought also to be moved by the words of Augustine (Retract. lib. 1 cap. 1), “In my writings against the Academics,” says he, “I regret having so often used the term Fortune; although I intended to denote by it not some goddess, but the fortuitous issue of events in external matters, whether good or evil. Hence, too, those words, Perhaps, Perchance, Fortuitously,13 				 <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_128"><font size="1">129</font></a>
  				which no religion forbids us to use, though everything must be referred to Divine Providence. Nor did I omit to observe this when I said, Although, perhaps, that which is vulgarly called Fortune, is also regulated by a hidden order, and what we call Chance is nothing else than that the reason and cause of which is secret. It is true, I so spoke, but I repent of having mentioned Fortune there as I did, when I see the very bad custom which men have of saying, not as they ought to do, 				‘So God pleased,’ but, ‘So Fortune pleased.’ ” In short, Augustine everywhere teaches, that if anything is left to fortune, the world moves at random. And although he elsewhere declares (Quæstionum, lib. 83). that all things are carried on, partly by the free will of man, and partly by the Providence of God, he shortly after shows clearly enough that his meaning was, that men also are ruled by Providence, when he assumes it as a principle, that there cannot be a greater absurdity than to hold 				that anything is done without the ordination of God; because it would happen at random. For which reason, he also excludes the contingency which depends on human will, maintaining a little further on, in clearer terms, that no cause must be sought for but the will of God. When he uses the term permission, the meaning which he attaches to it will best appear from a single passage (De Trinity. lib. 3 cap. 4), where he proves that the will of God is the supreme and primary cause of all things, 				because nothing happens without his order or permission. He certainly does not figure God sitting idly in a watch-tower, when he chooses to permit anything. The will which he represents as interposing is, if I may so express it, active (<i>actualis</i>), and but for this could not be regarded as a cause.</p>  			 
 <p class="Body"><a name="iv.i.xvii-p27"></a>9. But since our sluggish minds rest far beneath the height of Divine Providence, we must have recourse to a distinction which may assist them in rising. I say then, that though all things are ordered by the counsel and certain arrangement of God, to us, however, they are fortuitous,—not because we imagine that Fortune rules the world and mankind, and turns all things upside down at random (far be such a heartless thought from every Christian breast); but as the order, 				method, end, and necessity of events, are, for the most part, hidden in the counsel of God, though it is certain that they are produced by the will of God, they have the appearance of being fortuitous, such being the form under which they present themselves to us, whether considered in their own nature, or estimated according to our knowledge and Judgment. Let us suppose, for example, that a merchant, after entering a forest in company with trust-worthy individuals, imprudently strays from his 				companions and wanders bewildered till he falls into a den of robbers and is murdered. His death was not only foreseen by the eye of God, but had been fixed by his decree. For it is said, not that he foresaw how far the life of each individual should extend, but that he determined and fixed the bounds which could not be passed (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p27.1"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job014.htm#005">Job 14:5</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p27.1"></a>). Still, in relation to our capacity of discernment, all these things appear fortuitous. How will the Christian feel? Though he will consider that every 				circumstance which occurred in that person’s death was indeed in its nature fortuitous, he will have no doubt that the Providence of God overruled it and guided fortune to his own end. The same thing holds in the case of future contingencies. All future events being uncertain to us, seem in suspense as if ready to take either direction. Still, however, the impression remains seated in our hearts, that nothing will happen which the Lord has not provided. In this sense the term event is 				repeatedly used in Ecclesiastes, because, at the first glance, men do not penetrate to the primary cause which lies concealed. And yet, what is taught in Scripture of the secret providence of God was never so completely effaced from the human heart, as that some sparks did not always shine in the darkness. Thus the soothsayers of the Philistine, though they waver in uncertainty, attribute the adverse event partly to God and partly to chance. If the ark, say they, “Goes up by the way of his own 				coast to Bethshemish, then he has done us this great evil; but if not, then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us, it was a chance that happened to us.” (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p27.2"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1006.htm#009">1 Sam. 6:9</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p27.2"></a>). Foolishly, indeed, when divination fails them they flee to fortune. Still we see them constrained, so as not to venture to regard their disaster as fortuitous. But the mode in which God, by the curb of his Providence, turns events in whatever direction he pleases, will appear from a remarkable example. At the very 				same moment when David was discovered in the wilderness of Maon, the Philistines make an inroad into the country, and Saul is forced to depart (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p27.3"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#026">1 Sam. 23:26</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1023.htm#027">27</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p27.3"></a>). If God, in order to provide for the safety of his servant, threw this obstacle in the way of Saul, we surely cannot say, that though the Philistine took up arms contrary to human expectation, they did it by chance. What seems to us contingence, faith will recognise as the secret impulse of God. The reason is not always equally 				apparent, but we ought undoubtedly to hold that all the changes which take place in the world are produced by the secret agency of the hand of God. At the same time, that which God has determined, though it must come to pass, is not, however, precisely, or in its own nature, necessary. We have a familiar example in the case of our Saviour’s bones. As he assumed a body similar to ours, no sane man will deny that his bones were capable of being broken and yet it was impossible that they should be 				broken (<a name="iv.i.xvii-p27.4"></a><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#033">John 19:33</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh019.htm#036">36</a><a name="iv.i.xvii-p27.4"></a>). Hence, again, we see that there was good ground for the distinction which the Schoolmen made between necessity, <i>secundum quid</i>, and necessity absolute, also between the necessity of <i>consequent</i> and of <i>consequence</i>. God made the bones of his Son frangible, though he exempted them from actual fracture; and thus, in reference to the necessity of his counsel, made that impossible which might have naturally taken place.</p>
