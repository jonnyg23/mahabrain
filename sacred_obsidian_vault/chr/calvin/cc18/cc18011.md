 <p><a name="xii.i-p3"></a><b>1 </b>Hear ye the word which Jehovah speaks to you, O house of Israel:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, — The way of the Gentiles learn not, And of the signs of heaven be not afraid, For fear them do the Gentiles:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p5"></a><b>3 </b>Because the rites of the heathens are vanity, For a tree from the forest does <i>one </i>cut — The work of the craftsman’s hands by the ax;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p6"></a><b>4 </b>With silver and gold they beautify it, With nails and hammer they make it fast, That it should not move;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p7"></a><b>5 </b>As a palm, erect, but they speak not; And being raised, they are raised, for they cannot walk: Fear them not, for they cannot do evil, And to do good is not in their power. (2:14)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p8"></a><b>6 </b>From no time has been found <i>any </i>Like thee, Jehovah; great <i>art </i>thou, And great is thy name in power.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p9"></a><b>7 </b>Who should not fear thee, king of nations? For to thee this belongs; For among all the wise of the nations, And in all their kingdoms, From no time has there been <i>one</i> like thee. (2:28)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p10"></a><b>8 </b>Even in this one thing they are foolish and fatuitous — The teaching of vanities the wood is:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Silver, extended, is from Tarshish brought, And gold from Ophas, — The work of the artificer and of the melter’s hands; Hyacinth and purple <i>are </i>their garments, The work of the wise, all of them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p12"></a><b>10 </b>But Jehovah is God, the truth, God, the life and the king of ages: Through his fury tremble will the earth, And the nations will not bear his wrath.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Thus shall ye say to them, — The gods who made not the heaven and the earth, Let them perish from the earth and from under heaven:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p14"></a><b>12 </b>He who made the earth by his power, Who set in order the world by his wisdom, And by his understanding extended the heavens, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p15"></a><b>13 </b>At his voice <i>there is </i>abundance of waters in the heavens, And he makes vapors to ascend from the extremity of the earth; Lightnings he makes for rain, And brings the wind from his treasures. (2:31)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p16"></a><b>14 </b>Foolish is every man through <i>his </i>knowledge, Ashamed is every maker of the graven image, For a falsehood is the molten image, And there is no breath in them.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p17"></a><b>15 </b>Vanity they are, the work of illusions; At the time of their visitation they shall perish.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p18"></a><b>16 </b>But not like them <i>is </i>the portion of Jacob, For the Creator of all things is he, And Israel <i>is</i> the rod of his inheritance; Jehovah of hosts is his name.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p19"></a><b>17 </b>Gather from the land thy treasures Thou who dwellest in a fortress:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p20"></a><b>18 </b>For thus saith Jehovah, — Behold! will cast out <i>as </i>with a sling The inhabitants of the land at this time, And I will straiten them, That they may find <i>what they deserve.</i></p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p21"></a><b>19 </b>Woe is me on account of my bruising! Full of pain is the smiting given to me! and I said, — Surely it is my stroke, and I will bear it:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p22"></a><b>20 </b>My tent is pulled down, And all my cords are broken; My sons are gone from me, and there are none — No one to extend any more my tent, And to set up my curtains!</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p23"></a><b>21 </b>For infatuated are the pastors, And Jehovah have they not sought; Therefore have they not prospered, And all that was in their pastures has been destroyed.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p24"></a><b>22 </b>A sound of rumor! lo, it comes, And a great tumult, from the land of the north, To make the cities of Judah a waste, The habitation of dragons!</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p25"></a><b>23 </b>I know Jehovah, That his way is not in the power of man, <i>That </i>it is not in man who walketh to guide his steps.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p26"></a><b>24 </b>Chastise me, Jehovah, but only in moderation; Not in thy wrath, lest thou shouldest consume me:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.i-p27"></a><b>25 </b>Pour thy wrath on the nations, who know thee not, And on the families who have not called on thy name; For they have devoured Jacob, Yea, they have devoured and consumed him, And his tents have they laid waste.</p>  <a name="xii.ii"></a>

 <p><a name="xii.ii-p5"></a><b>3 </b>of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and thou shalt say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, — Cursed</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p6"></a><b>4</b> Is the man who hears not the words of this covenant, which I commanded your fathers in the day in which I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, — Hear ye my voice, and do according to all those things which I have commanded you; and ye shall be to me a people and I will</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p7"></a><b>5</b> Be to you a God; that I may confirm the oath which I swear to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, according to what it is at this day. And I answered and said, Amen, Jehovah.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p8"></a><b>6 </b>And Jehovah said to me, Proclaim these words in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, — Hear the words of this covenant and do them;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>For protesting I protested to your fathers, In the day in which I brought them Out of the land of Egypt, to this day, Rising up early and protesting, and saying, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p10"></a><b>8 </b>“Hear ye my voice:” Yet they heard not, nor inclined their ear, But walked, every one of them, After the wickedness of his own evil heart: I have therefore brought on them All the words of this covenant, Which I commanded them to do, But they did them not. (2:84)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p11"></a><b>9 </b>And Jehovah said to me, — Found out is a conspiracy, Among the men of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>Returned are they to the iniquities of their forefathers, Who refused to hear my words, But walked after foreign gods to serve them: Broken have the house of Israel and the house of Judah My covenant, which I made with their fathers.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah, — Behold, I will bring upon you an evil, From which ye shall not be able to escape; And they shall cry to me, but I will not hear them:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>And go shall the cities of Judah and the citizens of Jerusalem, And cry to the gods to whom they have offered incense; But by saving they will not save them In the time of <i>their </i>affliction:</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p15"></a><b>13 </b>For according to the number of thy cities Have been thy gods, O Judah; And according to the number of streets of Jerusalem, Have ye set up altars for reproach — Altars to offer incense to Baal. (2:94)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p16"></a><b>14 </b>And thou, pray not for this people, And raise not for them a cry and a prayer; For I will not hear them at the time When they shall cry to me for their distress.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p17"></a><b>15 </b>What has my beloved to do in mine house, While she commits abomination with many? And the flesh of the sanctuary is taken from thee; For when thou didst evil, thou didst then glory. (2:102)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p18"></a><b>16 </b>A green olive, fair in fruit <i>and </i>form, Hath Jehovah called thy name; At the noise of great tumult hath he kindled a <i>fire </i>on it, And broken down are its branches: (2:105)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p19"></a><b>17 </b>For Jehovah of hosts who planted thee Hath spoken against thee an evil, For the wickedness of the house of Israel And of the house of Judah, Which they have done for themselves, To provoke me by offering incense to Baal.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p20"></a><b>18 </b>Jehovah hath made me to know, and I knew it; Thou didst then discover to me their works.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p21"></a><b>19 </b>But I was like a lamb <i>or </i>an ox Led to be slain; and I knew not That they meditated thoughts against me: “Let us spoil with wood his bread, And cut him off from the land of the living; And let his name be remembered no more.” (2:113)</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p22"></a><b>20 </b>Now, Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, Who searchest the reins and the heart, Let me see thy vengeance on them, For to thee have I revealed my cause.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p23"></a><b>21 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah To the men of Anathoth, who seek thy life and say, “Prophesy thou not in the name of Jehovah, That thou mayest not die by our hand;”</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p24"></a><b>22 </b>Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, — Behold, I will visit them; Their young men shall die by the sword, Their sons and their daughters shall die by famine,</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.ii-p25"></a><b>23 </b>And there shall be no remnant of them; For I will bring evil on the men of Anathoth, In the year of their visitation.</p>  <a name="xii.iii"></a>

 <p><a name="xii.iii-p4"></a><b>2 </b>Thou hast planted them, they have even taken root; They have grown, they have even produced fruit: Nigh art thou in their mouth, But far from their reins.</p>

 <p><a name="xii.iii-p7"></a><b>5 </b>If with footmen thou hast run, And they have wearied thee, How canst thou contend with horsemen? In the land of peace thou hast trusted, How then canst thou do in the rising of Jordan?</p>

 <p><a name="xii.iii-p9"></a><b>7 </b>I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given up the darling of my soul Into the hand of her enemies!</p>

 <p><a name="xii.iii-p12"></a><b>10 </b>Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, They have trodden under foot my portion, They have made nay choice portion a desolate wilderness;</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.iii-p13"></a><b>11 </b>They have made it a desolation, It mourns to me, being desolate; Desolate is become the whole land; Though no one hath laid it to heart.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.iii-p14"></a><b>12 </b>On all high places in the wilderness have come destroyers; For the sword of Jehovah hath devoured, From one end to the other end of the land; There is no peace to any flesh.</p>

 <p><a name="xii.iv-p10"></a><b>8</b> Was marred, <i>and </i>it was good for nothing. Then came the word of Jehovah to me, saying, —</p>  		  
 <p><a name="xii.iv-p11"></a><b>9 </b>Thus saith Jehovah, — In this way will I mar the excellency of Judah And the great excellency of Jerusalem:</p>

 <p><a name="xii.iv-p16"></a><b>14 </b>And I will dash them, every one against his brother, The fathers also and the sons together, saith Jehovah: I will not spare, nor will I be propitious, Nor shew pity until I destroy them.</p>
