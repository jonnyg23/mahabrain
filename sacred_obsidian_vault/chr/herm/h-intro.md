 <h2>An Introduction to the Corpus Hermeticum</h2>
 
 <h3>by John Michael Greer</h3>
 
 
 
 The fifteen tractates of the <i>Corpus</i> <i>Hermeticum</i>,
 
 along with the <i>Perfect</i> <i>Sermon</i> or <i>Asclepius</i>,
 
 are the foundation documents of the Hermetic tradition.  Written
 
 by unknown authors in Egypt sometime before the end of the third
 
 century C.E., they were part of a once substantial literature
 
 attributed to the mythic figure of Hermes Trismegistus, a Hellenistic
 
 fusion of the Greek god Hermes and the Egyptian god Thoth.
 
 <p>
 
 This literature came out of the same religious and philosophical
 
 ferment that produced Neoplatonism, Christianity, and the diverse
 
 collection of teachings usually lumped together under the label
 
 "Gnosticism":  a ferment which had its roots in the
 
 impact of Platonic thought on the older traditions of the Hellenized
 
 East.  There are obvious connections and common themes linking
 
 each of these traditions, although each had its own answer to
 
 the major questions of the time.
 
 </p><p>
 
 The treatises we now call the <i>Corpus</i> <i>Hermeticum</i>
 
 were collected into a single volume in Byzantine times, and a
 
 copy of this volume survived to come into the hands of Lorenzo
 
 de Medici's agents in the fifteenth century.  Marsilio Ficino,
 
 the head of the Florentine Academy, was pulled off the task of
 
 translating the dialogues of Plato in order to put the <i>Corpus</i>
 
 <i>Hermeticum</i> into Latin first.  His translation saw print
 
 in 1463, and was reprinted at least twenty-two times over the
 
 next century and a half.
 
 </p><p>
 
 The treatises divide up into several groups.  The first (CH I),
 
 the "Poemandres", is the account of a revelation given
 
 to Hermes Trismegistus by the being Poemandres or "Man-Shepherd",
 
 an expression of the universal Mind.  The next eight (CH II-IX),
 
 the "General Sermons", are short dialogues or lectures
 
 discussing various basic points of Hermetic philosophy.  There
 
 follows the "Key" (CH X), a summary of the General Sermons,
 
 and after this a set of four tractates - "Mind unto Hermes",
 
 "About the Common Mind", "The Secret Sermon on
 
 the Mountain", and the "Letter of Hermes to Asclepius"
 
 (CH XI-XIV) - touching on the more mystical aspects of Hermeticism.
 
  The collection is rounded off by the "Definitions of Asclepius
 
 unto King Ammon" (CH XV), which may be composed of three
 
 fragments of longer works.

 <i>The Perfect Sermon</i>
 
 </p><p>
 
 The <i>Perfect Sermon</i> or <i>Asclepius</i>, which is
 
 also included here, reached the Renaissance by a different route.
 
  It was translated into Latin in ancient times, reputedly by the
 
 same Lucius Apuleius of Madaura whose comic-serious masterpiece
 
 <i>The Golden Ass</i> provides some of the best
 
 surviving evidence on the worship of Isis in the Roman world.
 
  Augustine of Hippo quotes from the old Latin translation at length
 
 in his City of God, and copies remained in circulation in medieval
 
 Europe all the way up to the Renaissance.  The original Greek
 
 version was lost, although quotations survive in several ancient
 
 sources.
 
 </p><p>
 
 The Perfect Sermon is substantially longer than any other surviving
 
 work of ancient Hermetic philosophy.  It covers topics which also
 
 occur in the Corpus Hermeticum, but touches on several other issues
 
 as well - among them magical processes for the manufacture of
 
 gods and a long and gloomy prophecy of the decline of Hermetic
 
 wisdom and the end of the world. 
 
 </p><p>
 
 <i>The Significance of the Hermetic Writings</i>
 
 </p><p>
 
 The <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i> landed like a well-aimed bomb
 
 amid the philosophical systems of late medieval Europe.  Quotations
 
 from the Hermetic literature in the Church Fathers (who were never
 
 shy of leaning on pagan sources to prove a point) accepted a traditional
 
 chronology which dated "Hermes Trismegistus," as a historical
 
 figure, to the time of Moses.  As a result, the Hermetic tractates'
 
 borrowings from Jewish scripture and Platonic philosophy were
 
 seen, in the Renaissance, as evidence that the <i>Corpus Hermeticum</i>
 
 had anticipated and influenced both.  The Hermetic philosophy
 
 was seen as a primordial wisdom tradition, identified with the
 
 "Wisdom of the Egyptians" mentioned in <i>Exodus</i>
 
 and lauded in Platonic dialogues such as the <i>Timaeus</i>. 
 
 It thus served as a useful club in the hands of intellectual rebels
 
 who sought to break the stranglehold of Aristotelian scholasticism
 
 on the universities at this time.
 
 </p><p>
 
 It also provided one of the most important weapons to another
 
 major rebellion of the age - the attempt to reestablish magic
 
 as a socially acceptable spiritual path in the Christian West.
 
  Another body of literature attributed to Hermes Trismegistus
 
 was made up of astrological, alchemical and magical texts.  If,
 
 as the scholars of the Renaissance believed, Hermes was a historical
 
 person who had written all these things, and if Church Fathers
 
 had quoted his philosophical works with approval, and if those
 
 same works could be shown to be wholly in keeping with some definitions
 
 of Christianity, then the whole structure of magical Hermeticism
 
 could be given a second-hand legitimacy in a Christian context.
 
 </p><p>
 
 This didn't work, of course; the radical redefinition of Western
 
 Christianity that took place in the Reformation and Counter-Reformation
 
 hardened doctrinal barriers to the point that people were being
 
 burned in the sixteenth century for practices that were considered
 
 evidences of devoutness in the fourteenth.  The attempt, though,
 
 made the language and concepts of the Hermetic tractates central
 
 to much of post-medieval magic in the West.

 <i>The Translation</i>
 
 </p><p>
 
 The translation of the <i>Corpus</i> <i>Hermeticum</i> and <i>Perfect 
 
 Sermon</i> given here is that of G.R.S. Mead (1863-1933), originally
 
 published as Vol. 2 of his <i>Thrice Greatest Hermes</i>
 
 (London, 1906).  Mead was a close associate of Helena Petrovna
 
 Blavatsky, the founder and moving spirit of the Theosophical Society,
 
 and most of his considerable scholarly output was brought out
 
 under Theosophical auspices.  The result, predictably, was that
 
 most of that output has effectively been blacklisted in academic
 
 circles ever since.
 
 </p><p>
 
 This is unfortunate, for Mead's translations of the Hermetic literature
 
 were until quite recently the best available in English.  (They
 
 are still the best in the public domain; thus their use here.)
 
  The Everard translation of 1650, which is still in print, reflects
 
 the state of scholarship at the time it was made - which is only
 
 a criticism because a few things have been learned since then!
 
  The Walter Scott translation - despite the cover blurb on the
 
 recent Shambhala reprint, this is not the Sir Walter Scott of
 
 <i>Ivanhoe</i> fame - while more recent than Mead's, is a product
 
 of the "New Criticism" of the first half of this century,
 
 and garbles the text severely; scholars of Hermeticism of the
 
 caliber of Dame Frances Yates have labeled the Scott translation
 
 worthless.  By contrast, a comparison of Mead's version to the
 
 excellent modern translation by Brian Copenhaver, or to the translations
 
 of CH I (Poemandres) and VII (The Greatest Ill Among Men is Ignorance
 
 of God) given in Bentley Layton's <i>The</i> <i>Gnostic</i> <i>Scriptures</i>,
 
 shows Mead as a capable translator, with a usually solid grasp
 
 of the meaning of these sometimes obscure texts.
 
 </p><p>
 
 There is admittedly one problem with Mead's translation:  the
 
 aesthetics of the English text.  Mead hoped, as he mentioned at
 
 the beginning of <i>Thrice</i> <i>Greatest</i> <i>Hermes</i>,
 
 to "render...these beautiful theosophic treatises into an
 
 English that might, perhaps, be thought in some small way worthy
 
 of the Greek originals."  Unfortunately for this ambition,
 
 he was writing at a time when the last remnants of the florid
 
 and pompous Victorian style were fighting it out with the more
 
 straightforward colloquial prose that became the style of the
 
 new century.  Caught in this tangle like so many writers of the
 
 time, Mead wanted to write in the grand style but apparently didn't
 
 know how.  The result is a sometimes bizarre mishmash in which
 
 turn-of-the-century slang stands cheek by jowl with overblown
 
 phrases in King James Bible diction, and in which mishandled archaicisms,
 
 inverted word order, and poetic contractions render the text less
 
 than graceful - and occasionally less than readable.  Seen from
 
 a late twentieth century sensibility, the result verges on unintentional
 
 self-parody in places:  for example, where Mead uses the Scots
 
 contraction "ta'en" (for "taken"), apparently
 
 for sheer poetic color, calling up an image of Hermes Trismegistus
 
 in kilt and sporran.
 
 </p><p>
 
 The "poetic" word order is probably the most serious
 
 barrier to readability; it's a good rule, whenever the translation
 
 seems to descend into gibberish, to try shuffling the words of
 
 the sentence in question.  It may also be worth noting that Mead
 
 consistently uses "for that" in place of "because"
 
 and "aught" in place of "any", and leaves
 
 out the word "the" more or less at random.
 
 </p><p>
 
 Finally, comments in (parentheses) and in [square brackets] are
 
 in Mead's original; those in &lt;angle brackets&gt; are my own
 
 additions.
