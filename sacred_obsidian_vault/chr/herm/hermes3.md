 <h3>translated by G.R.S. Mead</h3>
 
 
 
 <h2>III.  The Sacred Sermon</h2>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;This brief and apparently somewhat garbled text recounts the
 
 
 
 creation and nature of the world in terms much like those of the
 
 
 
 <i>Poemandres</i>.  The major theme is the renewal of all things
 
 
 
 in a cyclic universe, with the seven planetary rulers again playing
 
 
 
 a major role.  - JMG&gt;
 
 
 
 <p>
 
 
 
 1.  The Glory of all things is God, Godhead and Godly Nature.
 
 
 
  Source of the things that are is God, who is both Mind and Nature
 
 
 
 - yea Matter, the Wisdom that reveals all things.  Source [too]
 
 
 
 is Godhead - yea Nature, Energy, Necessity, and End, and Making-new-again.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Darkness that knew no bounds was in Abyss, and Water [too] and
 
 
 
 subtle Breath intelligent; these were by Power of God in Chaos.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Then Holy Light arose; and there collected 'neath Dry Space &lt;literally:
 
 
 
  "sand"&gt; from out Moist Essence Elements; and all
 
 
 
 the Gods do separate things out from fecund Nature.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 2.  All things being undefined and yet unwrought, the light things
 
 
 
 were assigned unto the height, the heavy ones had their foundations
 
 
 
 laid down underneath the moist part of Dry Space, the universal
 
 
 
 things being bounded off by Fire and hanged in Breath to keep
 
 
 
 them up.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And Heaven was seen in seven circles; its Gods were visible in
 
 
 
 forms of stars with all their signs; while Nature had her members
 
 
 
 made articulate together with the Gods in her.  And [Heaven's]
 
 
 
 periphery revolved in cyclic course, borne on by Breath of God.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 3.  And every God by his own proper power brought forth what was
 
 
 
 appointed him.  Thus there arose four-footed beasts, and creeping
 
 
 
 things, and those that in the water dwell, and things with wings,
 
 
 
 and everything that beareth seed, and grass, and shoot of every
 
 
 
 flower, all having in themselves seed of again-becoming.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And they selected out the births of men for gnosis of the works
 
 
 
 of God and attestation of the energy of Nature; the multitude
 
 
 
 of men for lordship over all beneath the heaven and gnosis of
 
 
 
 its blessings, that they might increase in increasing and multiply
 
 
 
 in multitude, and every soul infleshed by revolution of the Cyclic
 
 
 
 Gods, for observation of the marvels of Heaven and Heaven's Gods'
 
 
 
 revolution, and of the works of God and energy of Nature, for
 
 
 
 tokens of its blessings, for gnosis of the power of God, that
 
 
 
 they might know the fates that follow good and evil [deeds] and
 
 
 
 learn the cunning work of all good arts.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 4.  [Thus] there begins their living and their growing wise, according
 
 
 
 to the fate appointed by the revolution of the Cyclic Gods, and
 
 
 
 their deceasing for this end.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And there shall be memorials mighty of their handiworks upon the
 
 
 
 earth, leaving dim trace behind when cycles are renewed.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For every birth of flesh ensouled, and of the fruit of seed, and
 
 
 
 every handiwork, though it decay, shall of necessity renew itself,
 
 
 
 both by the renovation of the Gods and by the turning-round of
 
 
 
 Nature's rhythmic wheel.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For that whereas the Godhead is Nature's ever-making-new-again
 
 
 
 the cosmic mixture, Nature herself is also co-established in that
 
 
 
 Godhead.
