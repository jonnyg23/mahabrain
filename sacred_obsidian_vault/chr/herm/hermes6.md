 <h2>The Corpus Hermeticum</h2>
 
 
 
 <h3>translated by G.R.S. Mead</h3>
 
 
 
 <h2>VI.  In God Alone Is Good And Elsewhere Nowhere</h2>
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 &lt;This sermon on the nature of the Good, like <i>To</i> <i>Asclepius</i>
 
 
 
 (CH II), relies heavily on the technical language of classical
 
 
 
 Greek philosophy - a point which some of Mead's translations tend
 
 
 
 to obscure.  "The Good," in Greek thought, is also the
 
 
 
 self-caused and self-sufficient, and thus has little in common
 
 
 
 with later conceptions of "goodness," just as the Latin
 
 
 
 word <i>virtus</i> and the modern Christian concept of "virtue"
 
 
 
 are very nearly opposites despite their etymological connection.
 
 
 
  The word "passion" here also needs to be understood
 
 
 
 in its older sense, as the opposite of "action" (cf.
 
 
 
 "active" and "passive").
 
 
 
 <p>
 
 
 
 &lt;The negative attitude toward humanity and the cosmos which
 
 
 
 appears in this text contrasts sharply with the more positive
 
 
 
 assessment found, for example, in the <i>Poemandres</i> (CH I)
 
 
 
 or in the <i>Asclepius</i> - a reminder that these documents are
 
 
 
 relics of a diverse and not necessarily consistent school of thought.

 1.  Good, O Asclepius, is in none else save in God alone; nay,
 
 
 
 rather, Good is God Himself eternally.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 If it be so, [Good] must be essence, from every kind of motion
 
 
 
 and becoming free (though naught is free from It), possessed of
 
 
 
 stable energy around Itself, never too little, nor too much, an
 
 
 
 ever-full supply.  [Though] one, yet [is It] source of all; for
 
 
 
 what supplieth all is Good.  When I, moreover, say [supplieth]
 
 
 
 altogether [all], it is for ever Good.  But this belongs to no
 
 
 
 one else save God alone.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For He stands not in need of any thing, so that desiring it He
 
 
 
 should be bad; nor can a single thing of things that are be lost
 
 
 
 to him, on losing which He should be pained; for pain is part
 
 
 
 of bad.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Nor is there aught superior to Him, that He should be subdued
 
 
 
 by it; nor any peer to Him to do Him wrong, or [so that] He should
 
 
 
 fall in love on its account; nor aught that gives no ear to Him,
 
 
 
 whereat He should grow angry; nor wiser aught, for Him to envy.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 2.  Now as all these are non-existent in His being, what is there
 
 
 
 left but Good alone?
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For just as naught of bad is to be found in such transcendent
 
 
 
 Being, so too in no one of the rest will Good be found.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For in them are all of the other things &lt;i.e., those things
 
 
 
 which are not Good&gt; - both in the little and the great, both
 
 
 
 in each severally and in this living one that's greater than them
 
 
 
 all and the mightiest [of them] &lt;i.e., the cosmos&gt;.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For things subject to birth abound in passions, birth in itself
 
 
 
 being passible.  But where there's passion, nowhere is there Good;
 
 
 
 and where is Good, nowhere a single passion.  For where is day,
 
 
 
 nowhere is night; and where is night, day is nowhere.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Wherefore in genesis the Good can never be, but only be in the
 
 
 
 ingenerate.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 But seeing that the sharing in all things hath been bestowed on
 
 
 
 matter, so doth it share in Good.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 In this way is the Cosmos Good; that, in so far as it doth make
 
 
 
 all things, as far as making goes it's Good, but in all other
 
 
 
 things it is not Good.  For it's both passible and subject unto
 
 
 
 motion, and maker of things passible.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 3.  Whereas in man by greater or less of bad is good determined.
 
 
 
  For what is not too bad down here, is good, and good down here
 
 
 
 is the least part of bad.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 It cannot, therefore, be that good down here should be quite clean
 
 
 
 of bad, for down here good is fouled with bad; and being fouled,
 
 
 
 it stays no longer good, and staying not it changes into bad.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 In God alone, is, therefore, Good, or rather Good is God Himself.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 So then, Asclepius, the name alone of Good is found in men, the
 
 
 
 thing itself nowhere [in them], for this can never be.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For no material body doth contain It - a thing bound on all sides
 
 
 
 by bad, by labors, pains, desires and passions, by error and by
 
 
 
 foolish thoughts.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And greatest ill of all, Asclepius, is that each of these things
 
 
 
 that have been said above, is thought down here to be the greatest
 
 
 
 good.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 And what is still an even greater ill, is belly-lust, the error
 
 
 
 that doth lead the band of all the other ills - the thing that
 
 
 
 makes us turn down here from Good.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 4.  And I, for my part, give thanks to God, that He hath cast
 
 
 
 it in my mind about the Gnosis of the Good, that it can never
 
 
 
 be It should be in the world.  For that the world is "fullness"
 
 
 
 of the bad, but God of Good, and Good of God.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 The excellencies of the Beautiful are round the very essence [of
 
 
 
 the Good]; nay, they do seem too pure, too unalloyed; perchance
 
 
 
 'tis they that are themselves Its essences.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 For one may dare to say, Asclepius - if essence, sooth, He have
 
 
 
 - God's essence is the Beautiful; the Beautiful is further also
 
 
 
 Good.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 There is no Good that can be got from objects in the world.  For
 
 
 
 all the things that fall beneath the eye are image-things and
 
 
 
 pictures as it were; while those that do not meet [the eye are
 
 
 
 the realities], especially the [essence] of the Beautiful and
 
 
 
 Good.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Just as the eye cannot see God, so can it not behold the Beautiful
 
 
 
 and Good.  For that they are integral parts of God, wedded to
 
 
 
 Him alone, inseparate familiars, most beloved, with whom God is
 
 
 
 Himself in love, or they with God.
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 5.  If thou canst God conceive, thou shalt conceive the Beautiful
 
 
 
 and Good, transcending Light, made lighter than the Light by God.
 
 
 
  That Beauty is beyond compare, inimitate that Good, e'en as God
 
 
 
 is Himself.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 As, then, thou dost conceive of God, conceive the Beautiful and
 
 
 
 Good.  For they cannot be joined with aught of other things that
 
 
 
 live, since they can never be divorced from God.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Seek'st thou for God, thou seekest for the Beautiful.  One is
 
 
 
 the Path that leadeth unto It - Devotion joined with Gnosis.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 6.  And thus it is that they who do not know and do not tread
 
 
 
 Devotion's Path, do dare to call man beautiful and good, though
 
 
 
 he have ne'er e'en in his visions seen a whit that's Good, but
 
 
 
 is enveloped with every kind of bad, and thinks the bad is good,
 
 
 
 and thus doth make unceasing use of it, and even feareth that
 
 
 
 it should be ta'en from him, so straining every nerve not only
 
 
 
 to preserve but even to increase it.
 
 
 
 </p><p>
 
 
 
 Such are the things that men call good and beautiful, Asclepius
 
 
 
 - things which we cannot flee or hate; for hardest thing of all
 
 
 
 is that we've need of them and cannot live without them.
