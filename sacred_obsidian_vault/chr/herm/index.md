 <center><h1>The Corpus Hermeticum</h1></center>
 
 The Corpus Hermeticum are the core documents of the Hermetic tradition. 
 
 Dating from early in the Christian era, they were mistakenly dated to a 
 
 much earlier period by Church officials (and everyone else) up until the 
 
 15th century. Because of this, they were allowed to survive and we seen 
 
 as an early precursor to what was to be Christianity. We know today that 
 
 they were, in fact, from the early Christian era, and came out of the 
 
 turbulent religious seas of Hellenic Egypt.<p>
 
 These are all taken  from Mead's translations, which are in the public
 
 domain at this point.</p><p>
