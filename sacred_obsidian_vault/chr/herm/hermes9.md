 <h2>The Corpus Hermeticum</h2>
 
 <h3>translated by G.R.S. Mead</h3>
 
 <h2>IX.  On Thought and Sense</h2>
 
 <p>
 
 &lt;This somewhat diffuse essay covers a series of topics, starting
 
 with (and to some extent from) the concept that the set of perceptions
 
 we call "thoughts" and the set we call "sensory
 
 perceptions" are not significantly different from each other.
 
  The implications of this idea play a significant role in later
 
 Hermetic thought, particularly in the areas of magic and the Art
 
 of Memory; in this tractate, though, the issues involved are barely
 
 touched, and the argument wanders into moral dualisms and the
 
 equally important, but distinct, idea that the Cosmos is itself
 
 a divine creative power.
 
 </p><p>
 
 &lt;Section 10, in which understanding is held up as the source
 
 and precondition of belief, should probably be seen as part of
 
 the same ancient debate on the roles of faith and reason that
 
 gave rise to Tertullian's famous <i>credo</i> <i>quia</i> <i>absurdum</i>
 
 ("I believe because it is absurd"). - JMG&gt;
 
 </p><p>
 
 1.  I gave the Perfect Sermon (Logos) yesterday, Asclepius; today
 
 I think it right, as sequel thereunto, to go through point by
 
 point the Sermon about Sense.
 
 </p><p>
 
 Now sense and thought do seem to differ, in that the former has
 
 to do with matter, the latter has to do with substance.  But unto
 
 me both seem to be at-one and not to differ - in men I mean. 
 
 In other lives &lt;or living creatures&gt; sense is at-oned with
 
 Nature, but in men thought.
 
 </p><p>
 
 Now mind doth differ just as much from thought as God doth from
 
 divinity.  For that divinity by God doth come to be, and by mind
 
 thought, the sister of the word (logos) and instruments of one
 
 another.  For neither doth the word (logos) find utterance without
 
 thought, nor is thought manifested without word.
 
 </p><p>
 
 2.  So sense and thought both flow together into man, as though
 
 they were entwined with one another.  For neither without sensing
 
 can one think, nor without thinking sense.
 
 </p><p>
 
 But it is possible [they say] to think a thing apart from sense,
 
 as those who fancy sights in dreams.  But unto me it seems that
 
 both of these activities occur in dream-sight, and sense doth
 
 pass out of the sleeping to the waking state.
 
 </p><p>
 
 For man is separated into soul and body, and only when the two
 
 sides of his sense agree together, does utterance of its thought
 
 conceived by mind take place.
 
 </p><p>
 
 3.  For it is mind that doth conceive all thoughts - good thoughts
 
 when it receives the seeds from God, their contraries when [it
 
 receiveth them] from the daimonials; no part of Cosmos being free
 
 of daimon, who stealthily doth creep into the daimon who's illumined
 
 by God's light &lt;i.e., the human soul&gt;, and sow in him the
 
 seed of its own energy.  
 
 </p><p>
 
 And mind conceives the seed thus sown, adultery, murder, parricide,
 
 [and] sacrilege, impiety, [and] strangling, casting down precipices,
 
 and all such other deeds as are the work of evil daimons.
 
 </p><p>
 
 4.  The seeds of God, 'tis true, are few, but vast and fair, and
 
 good - virtue and self-control, devotion.  Devotion is God-gnosis;
 
 and he who knoweth God, being filled with all good things, thinks
 
 godly thoughts and not thoughts like the many [think].
 
 </p><p>
 
 For this cause they who Gnostic are, please not the many, nor
 
 the many them.  They are thought mad and laughted at; they're
 
 hated and despised, and sometimes even put to death.
 
 </p><p>
 
 For we did say that bad must needs dwell on earth, where 'tis
 
 in its own place.  Its place is earth, and not Cosmos, as some
 
 will sometimes say with impious tongue.
 
 </p><p>
 
 But he who is a devotee of God, will bear with all - once he has
 
 sensed the Gnosis.  For such an one all things, e'en though they
 
 be for others bad, are for him good; deliberately he doth refer
 
 them all unto the Gnosis.  And, thing most marvelous, 'tis he
 
 alone who maketh bad things good.
 
 </p><p>
 
 5.  But I return once more to the Discourse (Logos) on Sense.
 
  That sense doth share with thought in man, doth constitute him
 
 man.  But 'tis not [every] man, as I have said, who benefits by
 
 thought; for this man is material, that other one substantial.
 
 </p><p>
 
 For the material man, as I have said, [consorting] with the bad,
 
 doth have his seed of thought from daimons; while the substantial
 
 men [consorting] with the Good, are saved by God.
 
 </p><p>
 
 Now God is Maker of all things, and in His making, He maketh all
 
 [at last] like to Himself; but they, while they're becoming good
 
 by exercise of their activity, are unproductive things.
 
 </p><p>
 
 It is the working of the Cosmic Course that maketh their becomings
 
 what they are, befouling some of them with bad and others of them
 
 making clean with good.
 
 </p><p>
 
 For Cosmos, too, Asclepius, possesseth sense-and-thought peculiar
 
 to itself, not like that of man; 'tis not so manifold, but as
 
 it were a better and a simpler one.
 
 </p><p>
 
 6.  The single sense-and-thought of Cosmos is to make all things,
 
 and make them back into itself again, as Organ of the Will of
 
 God, so organized that it, receiving all the seeds into itself
 
 from God, and keeping them within itself, may make all manifest,
 
 and [then] dissolving them, make them all new again; and thus,
 
 like a Good Gardener of Life, things that have been dissolved,
 
 it taketh to itself, and giveth them renewal once again.
 
 </p><p>
 
 There is no thing to which it gives not life; but taking all unto
 
 itself it makes them live, and is at the same time the Place of
 
 Life and its Creator.
 
 </p><p>
 
 7.  Now bodies matter [-made] are in diversity.  Some are of earth,
 
 of water some, some are of air, and some of fire.
 
 </p><p>
 
 But they are all composed; some are more [composite], and some
 
 are simpler.  The heavier ones are more [composed], the lighter
 
 less so.
 
 </p><p>
 
 It is the speed of Cosmos' Course that works the manifoldness
 
 of the kinds of births.  For being a most swift Breath, it doth
 
 bestow their qualities on bodies together with the One Pleroma
 
 - that of Life.
 
 </p><p>
 
 8.  God, then, is Sire of Cosmos; Cosmos, of all in Cosmos.  And
 
 Cosmos is God's Son; but things in Cosmos are by Cosmos.
 
 </p><p>
 
 And properly hath it been called Cosmos [Order]; for that it orders
 
 all with their diversity of birth, with its not leaving aught
 
 without its life, with the unweariedness of its activity, the
 
 speed of its necessity, the composition of its elements, and order
 
 of its creatures.
 
 </p><p>
 
 The same, then, of necessity and propriety should have the name
 
 of Order.  
 
 </p><p>
 
 The sense-and-thought, then, of all lives doth come into them
 
 from without, inbreathed by what contains [them all]; whereas
 
 Cosmos receives them once for all together with its coming into
 
 being, and keeps them as a gift from God.
 
 </p><p>
 
 9.  But God is not, as some suppose, beyond the reach of sense-and-thought.
 
  It is through superstition men thus impiously speak.
 
 </p><p>
 
 For all the things that are, Asclepius, all are in God, are brought
 
 by God to be, and do depend on Him - both things that act through
 
 bodies, and things that through soul-substance make [other things]
 
 to move, and things that make things live by means of spirit,
 
 and things that take unto themselves the things that are worn
 
 out.
 
 </p><p>
 
 And rightly so; nay, I would rather say, He doth not have these
 
 things; but I speak forth the truth, He is them all Himself. 
 
 He doth not get them from without, but gives them out [from Him].
 
 </p><p>
 
 This is God's sense-and-thought, ever to move all things.  And
 
 never time shall be when e'en a whit of things that are shall
 
 cease; and when I say "a whit of things that are", I
 
 mean a whit of God.  For thigs that are, God hath; nor aught [is
 
 there] without Him, nor [is] He without aught.
 
 </p><p>
 
 10.  These things should seem to thee, Asclepius, if thou dost
 
 understand them, true; but if thou dost not understand, things
 
 not to be believed.
 
 </p><p>
 
 To understand is to believe, to not believe is not to understand.
 
 </p><p>
 
 My word (logos) doth go before [thee] to the truth.  But mighty
 
 is the mind, and when it hath been led by word up to a certain
 
 point, it hath the power to come before [thee] to the truth.
 
 </p><p>
 
 And having thought o'er all these things, and found them consonant
 
 with those which have already been translated by the reason, it
 
 hath [e'en now] believed, and found its rest in that Fair Faith.
 
 </p><p>
 
 To those, then, who by God['s good aid] do understand the things
 
 that have been said [by us] above, they're credible; but unto
 
 those who understand them not, incredible.
 
 </p><p>
 
 Let so much, then, suffice on thought-and-sense.
