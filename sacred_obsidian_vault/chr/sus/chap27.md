   <h2 align="center">THE TEST OF PRESENT TRENDS OF THOUGHT—PSYCHOLOGICAL</h2>
 
   <p>It may be worth while to pause a little longer upon the psychological test of the Christian religion. For in this
   psychological test are involved, in a kind of concrete way, all the other tests. And it can hardly fail to be
   suggestive to try to apply to the Christian view and life the test of the four great inferences of modern psychology,
   once before used to suggest the great common conditions of all the activities of our life: the complexity of life,
   the unity of the mind, the central importance of will and action, and the concreteness of the real.</p>
 
   <p>Does Christianity, conceived as life, meet these tests? The recognition of the complexity of life on the part of
   Christianity seems to me to be clearly shown in the fact that Christianity is, in the first place, not ascetic. My
   own clear judgment is in entire agreement with that of Professor James Seth that Christ's conception cannot be
   regarded as truly ascetic, in the ordinary acceptance of that term.[<a href="#foot1" name="text1">1</a>] Christ
   certainly neither lives nor thinks as an ascetic. His whole point of view is rather that of recognizing all life as
   coming from the Father, and all its goods to be rejoiced in as goods; though with distinct recognition that some are
   inferior to others, and that, if need be, the lower must be unhesitatingly sacrificed to the higher.</p>
 
   <p>The similar refusal of the whole New Testament to draw any line of separation between the sacred and the secular,
   is another proof of Christianity's recognition of the complexity of life. Christianity's knitting up of the
   human and the divine, too, is itself an assertion of the same fact. The Christian view is no gnosticism. God is for
   it the source of all. And it is the same God, that made the world and man, who reveals himself in Christ. The very
   assertion of the incarnation, and the conception of duty as the will of God, of love as the first and great
   commandment, and of God himself as love and personal, are all so many separate assertions of the complexity and
   interrelatedness of all life. And in this growing psychological conviction of the complexity of life, of the
   interrelatedness of all, we are, thus, only returning to the standpoint of Christ and of the New Testament.</p>
 
   <p>And so harmonious is the teaching of Jesus with the present psychological emphasis upon the unity of mind, that
   this may even be called one of the four fundamental principles and motives chiefly used by Christ in the Sermon on
   the Mount. He appeals repeatedly to the principle of the unity of the spiritual life, insisting that it is impossible
   to fall below one's best at one point and be all that one ought to be at other points. And it is hardly too much
   to say that, in its recognition of the unity of the mind, the Christian conception fulfils most completely both the
   intellectual and the emotional conditions of rational living.</p>
 
   <p>On the intellectual side, it gives the most needed helps, and is able to face the most dangerous hindrances.</p>
 
   <p>While it makes no attempt to answer all curious intellectual inquiries, it does give, in the great revelation in
   Christ, sufficient ground for faith. The history of the Christian world is itself the best proof that beyond any
   other influence, it has also brought men to full self-consciousness.</p>
 
   <p>At the same time, as Romanes so suggestively says, it has left men free for all scientific inquiry. "One of
   the strongest pieces of objective evidence," he says, "in favor of Christianity . . . . is the absence from
   the biography of Christ of any doctrine which the subsequent growth of human knowledge—whether in natural science,
   ethics, political economy, or elsewhere—has had to discount. This negative argument is really almost as strong as is
   the positive one from what Christ did teach. For, when we consider what a large number of sayings are recorded of—or
   at least attributed to—him, it becomes most remarkable that in literal truth there is no reason why any of his words
   should ever pass away in the sense of becoming obsolete. 'Not even now could it be easy,' says John Stuart
   Mill, 'even for an unbeliever, to find a better translation of the rule of virtue from the abstract into the
   concrete, than to endeavor so to live that Christ would approve our life.' Contrast Jesus Christ in this respect
   with other thinkers of like antiquity. Even Plato, who though some four hundred years before Christ in point of time,
   was greatly in advance of him in respect of philosophic thought—not only because Athens then presented the
   extraordinary phenomenon which it did of genius in all directions never since equalled, but also because he,
   following Socrates, was, so to speak, the greatest representative of human reason in the direction of
   spirituality—even Plato, I say, is nowhere in this respect as compared with Christ. Read the dialogues, and see how
   enormous is the contrast with the Gospels in respect of errors of all kinds—reaching even to absurdity in respect to
   reason and to sayings shocking to the moral sense. Yet this is confessedly the highest level of human reason on the
   lines of spirituality, when unaided by alleged revelation."</p>
 
   <p>And the contribution which Christianity makes even on the intellectual side, in that it gives a clear, definite,
   ethical ideal in Christ, is quite inestimable. The intellectual stimulus of such an ideal, to say nothing of its
   moral value, is beyond computation.</p>
 
   <p>And when one thinks of the chief intellectual hindrances in true living—over-sophistication, making insights take
   the place of doing, and intellectual vagueness—it can hardly be doubted that Christianity is peculiarly adapted to
   meet them. In its firm hold, through Christ, on great convictions and ideals, it has no room for sophistication; and
   its predominant moral interest and insistent ethical demand definitely shut out those who hear and do not. At the
   same time, both the definiteness of Christ's ethical ideals and his conception of all moral demands as the will
   of a loving Father, stand opposed to the greatest dangers of intellectual vagueness.</p>
 
   <p>In the same way, too, the example and the teaching of Christ point to the best and most normal emotional
   conditions. If we really believe the teaching of Jesus, there is already open to us the most ideal emotional
   conditions for the highest living. It cannot fail to give what psychology recognizes as the stimulating effect of
   joyful emotions. It is truly a religion of good tidings. With its trust in a loving Father and its conception of all
   duty as his will, its view of life as training, and its assurance of the immortal hope, it brings to men all of good
   that a religion can well be conceived to bring.</p>
 
   <p>Putting men, as it does, face to face with an incomparable literary and personal expression of the greatest truths
   and motives, it calls out in men, too, in the profoundest way, the needed sober and strenuous moods for the highest
   willing. Christianity is equally decisive in setting aside all strained and sham and passive emotions. Neither in
   Christ's example nor in his teaching is stress anywhere laid on feeling. It is rather taken as an incidental
   result of true living. And in its powerful and combined appeal to reason and conscience and will, it gives power to
   suspend action in the face of strong emotion. Christianity never allows the right of simple feeling to rule.</p>
 
   <p>Just because it is profoundly ethical, Christianity cannot fail to recognize, with modern psychology, the enormous
   place of will in life.</p>
 
   <p>It is only in that ethical living that takes place in personal relations, that the whole will is called out. And
   in this stimulating and strengthening of the will, Christianity has at the same time, in accordance with this
   psychological emphasis, strengthened and deepened all the life of men. It has made men capable of being more, of
   counting more, of enjoying more. So, too, psychology's recognition of the fundamental nature of self-control may
   be regarded as distinctively Christian. Indeed, Christ's great, fundamental, all-inclusive law of losing the life
   to save the life is only the highest expression of self-control. And Christianity's ethical demand, once more,
   calls for self-control so constantly that its attitude has even been mistaken for that of asceticism. Moreover, the
   self-control which Christianity enjoins and makes possible is not merely negative, but thoroughly positive, as
   psychology demands that it should be.</p>
 
   <p>And Christianity meets in an even deeper way the insistence of psychology on the central importance of will and
   action, by the thoroughgoing fashion in which it makes the objective mood—the mood of activity and of work—the normal
   mood of man. In a degree true of no other influence, it has proved able to take men out of themselves, in its
   absorption of them in the great work of a great cause, and in the great love of a great Saviour. In this very way it
   not only fulfils for men a chief condition of character and happiness and influence, but it brings to them a chief
   means of all three, in work which can be the fullest expression of man's best self; work that men can think of as
   God-given, and, because service both to God and to men, as of abiding worth. Christianity calls men even to the
   sharing of Christ's own vicarious and redemptive work.</p>
 
   <p>And finally, Christianity exemplifies not less fully psychology's fourth fundamental insistence on the
   concreteness of the real, in its preeminent respect for the person—the greatest condition of character and happiness
   and influence, and in its preeminent use of personal association—the greatest means to character and happiness and
   influence. For the assertion of the concreteness of the real is finally the insistence upon the personal in the whole
   of its range. Now, on the one hand, respect for the person lies so deeply imbedded in the very spirit of
   Christianity, that one cannot fail to see it in the entire conduct and teaching of Jesus. One cannot fail to regard
   it, according to the Christian conception, as even the fundamental principle of God in his treatment of men; and he
   cannot doubt, as Lotze and Wundt have both borne testimony, that to Christianity it is due that this respect for man
   as man has come into the world. On the other hand, the very fact that Christianity points not to a redeeming
   doctrine, but to a redeeming person, . and professes to open to men a constant, intimate, and unobtrusive relation of
   the personal Spirit of God with their spirits, shows how firmly imbedded in the Christian teaching is the thought of
   the supreme importance of personal association.</p>
 
   <p>With even so rapid and imperfect an attempt to apply to Christianity the tests of modern psychology, one can
   hardly fail to see that here at least the Christian view is indubitably connected with one of the realest trends of
   our own time, and meets with convincing satisfaction all the tests involved in the dominant elements of this
   trend.</p>
