   <h2 align="center">THE WITNESS OF OUR CONSCIOUSLY BEST HOURS</h2>
 
   <p>This close connection of the religious and the ethical leads us to emphasize the important principle that, when we
   find fluctuations in our convictions concerning the reality of anything, we must ask for the witness of our
   consciously best hours, physically, intellectually, and morally. If religious conviction does tend to go up and down
   with our moral attitude, and the ethical has any real justification, then our religious convictions are just so far
   confirmed. And, with reference to the entire man, it behooves us to ask, When does the spiritual world seem most real
   to us? in our best or our worst moments? when we are consciously most in possession of ourselves in every way, or
   when we are consciously below our best? So Tyndall, for example, tested the doctrine of material atheism: "I
   have noticed," he said, "during years of self-observation, that it is not in hours of clearness and vigor
   that this doctrine commends itself to my mind."[<a name="text1" href="#foot1">1</a>]</p>
 
   <p>So far, now, as we can control the conditions—bodily, intellectual, and moral—of our best hours, the ideal world
   may be truly said to exist for us in the proportion in which we make it to exist. And to just that extent, the
   fluctuation in our sense of the reality of the spiritual life may be ascribed to removable causes, already
   considered. But so far as our sense of the reality of the spiritual life is affected by limitations inevitably
   involved in our finiteness, or by fluctuations in our mental states due to constitutional conditions and connections
   but very partially subject to our control, the causes are not removable, but they are recognizable. And to see that
   the wavering sense of spiritual reality is due, not to any lack of realness in the spiritual world, but only to
   changing conditions in ourselves, is to be delivered from many doubts and fears, and to take a long step toward a
   confident religious faith. When Kant found that a constant feeling of depression which attended him had its cause in
   the abnormal narrowness of his chest, he could not throw off the physical feeling, but he could keep it from
   shadowing his life. So, we need constantly to take account of our necessary finite limitations and the inevitable
   fluctuations of our life, if we are to keep our religious faith clear and strong.</p>
 
   <p>The very fact, that these unremovable causes of the sense of the unreality of the spiritual life are to be found
   in our natural constitution, suggests that it may not be intended that the spiritual life should always seem to us
   equally real and commanding. And if we press the inquiry, Why should this be intended? it seems possible to suggest
   but one answer consonant with a genuine religious faith: it must be needed as a part of our moral and spiritual
   training. We are brought, thus, to consider the last of the causes of the seeming unreality of the spiritual
   life.</p>
