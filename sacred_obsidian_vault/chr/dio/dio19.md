 <p align="center"><a name="ii.iii.ii.i-p1"></a>What is the Divine Gloom?</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.iii.ii.i-p2"></a>SECTION I.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.iii.ii.i-p3"></a>TRIAD supernal, both super-God and super-good, Guardian of the Theosophy of Christian  men, direct us aright to the super-unknown and super-brilliant and highest summit  of the mystic Oracles, where the simple and absolute and changeless mysteries of  theology lie hidden within the super-luminous gloom of the silence, revealing hidden  things, which in its deepest darkness shines above the most super-brilliant, and  in the altogether impalpable and invisible, fills to overflowing the eyeless minds  with glories of surpassing beauty. This then be my prayer; but thou, O dear Timothy,  by thy persistent commerce with the mystic visions, leave behind both sensible perceptions  and intellectual efforts, and all objects of sense and intelligence, and all things  not being and being, and be raised aloft unknowingly to the union, as far as attainable,  with Him Who is above every essence and knowledge. For by the resistless and absolute  ecstasy in all purity, from thyself and all, thou wilt be carried on high, to the  superessential ray of the Divine darkness, when thou hast cast away all, and become  free from all.  <a name="page_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a> <a name="ii.iii.ii.i-Page_131"></a></p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.iii.ii.i-p4"></a>SECTION II.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.iii.ii.i-p5"></a>But see that none of the uninitiated listen to these things--those I mean who  are entangled in things being, and fancy there is nothing superessentially above  things being, but imagine that they know, by their own knowledge, Him, Who has placed  darkness as His hiding-place. But, if the Divine initiations are above such, what  would any one say respecting those still more uninitiated, such as both portray  the Cause exalted above all, from the lowest of things created, and say that It  in no wise excels the no-gods fashioned by themselves and of manifold shapes, it  being our duty both to attribute and affirm all the attributes of things existing  to It, as Cause of all, and more properly to deny them all to It, as being above  all, and not to consider the negations to be in opposition to the affirmations,  but far rather that It, which is above every abstraction and definition, is above  the privations.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.iii.ii.i-p6"></a>SECTION III.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.iii.ii.i-p7"></a>Thus, then, the divine Bartholomew says that Theology is much and least, and  the Gospel broad and great, and on the other hand concise. He seems to me to have  comprehended this supernaturally, that the good Cause of all is both of much utterance,  and at the same time of briefest utterance and without utterance; as having neither  utterance nor conception, because It is superessentially exalted above all, and  manifested without veil and in truth, to those alone who pass through both all things  consecrated<a name="page_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a> <a name="ii.iii.ii.i-Page_132"></a> and pure, and ascend above every ascent of all holy summits,  and leave behind all divine lights and sounds, and heavenly words, and enter into  the gloom, where really is, as the Oracles say, He Who is beyond all. For even the  divine Moses is himself strictly bidden to be first purified, and then to be separated  from those who are not so, and after entire cleansing hears the many-voiced trumpets,  and sees many lights, shedding pure and streaming rays; then he is separated from  the multitude, and with the chosen priests goes first to the summit of the divine  ascents, although even then he does not meet with Almighty God Himself, but views  not Him (for He is viewless) but the place where He is. Now this I think signifies  that the most Divine and Highest of the things seen and contemplated are a sort  of suggestive expression, of the things subject to Him Who is above all, through  which His wholly inconceivable Presence is shown, reaching to the highest spiritual  summits of His most holy places; and then he (Moses) is freed from them who are  both seen and seeing, and enters into the gloom of the <i>Agnosia; </i>a gloom veritably  mystic, within which he closes all perceptions of knowledge and enters into the  altogether impalpable and unseen, being wholly of Him Who is beyond all, and of  none, neither himself nor other; and by inactivity of all knowledge, united in his  better part to. the altogether Unknown, and by knowing nothing, knowing above mind.</p>   <a name="page_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a> <a name="ii.iii.ii.i-Page_133"></a>
