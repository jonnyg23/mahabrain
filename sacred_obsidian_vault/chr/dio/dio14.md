 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p1"></a>Concerning Peace, and what is meant by the self-existent Being;  what is the self-existent Life, and what the self-existent Power, and such like  expressions.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p2"></a>SECTION I.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p3"></a>COME, then, let us extol the <i>Peace </i>Divine, and Source of conciliation,  by hymns of peace! For this it is which unifies all, and engenders, and effects  the agreement and fellowship of all. Wherefore, even all things aspire to it, which  turns their divided multiplicity into the thorough Oneness, and unifies the tribal  war of the whole into a homogeneous dwelling together, by the participation of the  divine Peace. With regard, then, to the more reverend of the conciliating powers,  these indeed are united to themselves and to each other, and to the one Source of  Peace of the whole; and the things (that are) under them, these they unite also  to themselves and  <a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-Page_113"></a> to each other, and to the One and all-perfect Source and Cause of  the Peace of all, which, passing in-divisibly to the whole, limits and terminates  and secures everything, as if by a kind of bolts, which bind together things that  are separated; and do not permit them, when separated, to rush to infinity and the  boundless, and to become without order, and without stability, and destitute of  God, and to depart from the union amongst themselves, and to become intermingled  m each other, in every sort of confusion. Concerning then, this, the Divine Peace  and Repose, which the holy Justus calls unutterableness, and, as compared with every  known progression, immobility, how it rests and is at ease, and how it is in itself,  and within itself, and entire, and to itself entire is super-united, and when entering  into itself, and multiplying itself, neither loses its own Union, but even proceeds  to all, whilst remaining entire within, by reason of excess of its Union surpassing  all, it is neither permitted, nor attainable to any existing being, either to express  or to understand. But, having premised this, as unutterable and unknowable, as being  beyond all, let us examine its conceived and uttered participations, and this, as  possible to men, and to us, as inferior to many good men.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p4"></a>SECTION II.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p5"></a>First then, this must be said, that It is mainstay of the self-existent Peace,  both the general and the particular; and that It mingles all things with each other  within their unconfused union, as beseems  <a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-Page_114"></a> which, united indivisibly, and at the same time they severally continuously  unmingled stand, as regards their own proper kind, not muddled through their mingling  with the opposite, nor blunting any of their unifying distinctness and purity. Let  us then contemplate a certain One and simple nature of the peaceful Union, unifying  all things to Itself, and to themselves, and to each other; and preserving all things  in an unconfused grasp of all, both unmingled and mingled together; by reason of  which the divine Minds, being united,, are united to their own conceptions, and  to the things conceived; and again they ascend to the unknowable contact of things  fixed above mind; by reason of which, souls, by uniting their manifold reasonings,  and collecting them together to an One intellectual Purity, advance in a manner  proper to themselves, by method and order, through the immaterial and indivisible  conception, to the union above conception; by reason of which, the one and indissoluble  connection of all is established, within its Divine Harmony, and is harmonized by  complete concord and agreement and fellowship, being united without confusion, and  held together without division. For the fulness of the perfect Peace passes through  to all existing things, as beseems the most simple, and unmingled presence of Its  unifying power, making all One. and binding the extremes through the intermediate  to the extremes, which are yoked together in an one connatural friendship; and bestowing  the enjoyment of Itself, even to the furthest extremities of the whole,  <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-Page_115"></a> and making all things of one family, by the unities, the identities,  the unions, the conjunctions of the Divine Peace, standing of course indivisibly,  and showing all in one, and passing through all, and not stepping out of Its own  identity. For It advances to all, and imparts Itself to all, in a manner appropriate  to them, and there overflows an abundance of peaceful fertility; and It remains,  through excess of union, super-united, entire, to and throughout Its whole self.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p6"></a>SECTION III.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p7"></a>But how, some one may say, do all things aspire to peace, for many things rejoice  in diversity and division, and would not, at any time, of their own accord, be willingly  in repose. Now, if in saying this, he affirms, that the identity of each existing  thing is diversity and division, and that there is no existent thing whatever, which  at any time is willing to destroy this (identity), neither would we in any way contradict  this, but would declare even this an aspiration after peace. For all things love  to dwell at peace, and to be united amongst themselves, and to be unmoved and unfallen  from themselves, and the things of themselves. And the perfect Peace seeks to guard  the idiosyncrasy of each unmoved and unconfused, by its peace-giving forethought,  preserving everything unmoved and unconfused, both as regards themselves and each  other, and establishes all things by a stable and  <a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-Page_116"></a> unswerving power, towards their own peace and immobility.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p8"></a>SECTION IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p9"></a>And if all things in motion desire, not repose, but ever to make known their  own proper movement, even this is an aspiration after the Divine Peace of the whole,  which preserves all things from falling away of their own accord, and guards the  idiosyncrasy and moving life of all moving things unmoved and free from falling,  so that the things moved, being at peace amongst themselves, and always in the same  condition, perform their own proper functions.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p10"></a>SECTION V.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p11"></a>But if, in affirming the diversity as a falling from peace, he insists that peace  is not beloved by all, verily there is no existing being which has entirely fallen  from every kind of union; for, the altogether unstable and infinite, and unestablished,  and without limit, is neither an actual thing, nor in things actual. But if he says,  that those are inimical to peace, and good things of peace, who rejoice in strife  and anger and changes and disturbances, even these are controlled by obscure images  of a peaceful aspiration; being vexed by tumultuous passions, and ignorantly aspiring  to calm them, they imagine that they will pacify themselves by the gratification  of things which ever elude them, and they are disturbed by the non-attainment of  the pleasures which overpowered them. What would any one say of the peaceful stream  of  <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-Page_117"></a> love towards man in Christ, according to which we have learned no  longer to wage war, either with ourselves, or each other, or with angels, but that  with them, according to our power, we should also be fellow-workers in Divine things,  after the purpose of Jesus, Who worketh all in all, and forms a peace unutterable  and pre-determined from Eternity, and reconciles us to Himself, in Spirit, and through  Himself and in Himself to the Father; concerning which supernatural gifts it is  sufficiently spoken in the <i>Theological Outlines, </i>whilst the Oracles of the  sacred inspiration furnish us with additional testimony.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p12"></a>SECTION VI.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-p13"></a>But, since you once asked me by letter, what in the world I consider the self-existent  Being, the self-existent Life, the self-existent Wisdom, and said that you debated  with yourself how, at one time, I call Almighty God, self-existent Life, and at  another, Mainstay of the self-existent Life, I thought it necessary, O holy man  of God, to also free you from this difficulty, so far as lay in my power. And first  then, in order that we may now resume that which I have said a thousand times already,  there is no contradiction in saying that Almighty God is self-existent Power, or  self-existent Life, and that He is Mainstay of the self-existent Life or Peace or  Power. For the latter, He is named from things existing, and specially from the  first existing, as Cause of all existing things; and the former, as being above  all, even the first existing of beings, being  <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-Page_118"></a> above superessentially. But you say, what in the world do we call  the self-existent Being, or the self-existent Life, or whatever we lay down to be  absolutely and originally and to have stood forth primarily from God? And we reply,  this is not crooked but straight, and has a simple explanation. For we do not say  that the self-existent Being, as Cause of the being of all things, is a sort of  Divine or angelic essence (for the Superessential alone is Source and Essence and  Cause of the existence of all things, and of the self-existent Being), nor that  another Deity, besides the Super-divine, produces Life for all that live, and is  a Life Causative of the self-existent Life; nor to speak summarily, that essences  and personalities originate and make existing things, so that superficial people  have named them both gods, and creators of existing things,--whom, to speak truly  and properly, neither they themselves knew (for they are non-existent), nor their  fathers,--but we call self-existent Being, and self-existent Life, and self-existent  Deity, as regards at least Source, and Deity, and Cause, the One Superior and  Superessential  Source and Cause; but as regards Impartation, the providential Powers, that issue  forth from God the unparticipating, (these we call) the self-existent essentiation,  self-existent living, self-existent deification, by participating in which according  to their own capacity, things existing, both are, and are said to be, existing,  and living, and full of God--and the rest in the same way. Wherefore also, He is  called the good Mainstay of the first of these, then  <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 119</font></a> <a name="ii.ii.ii.xi-Page_119"></a> of the whole of them, then of the portions of them, then of those  who participate in them entirely, then of those who participate in them in part.  And why must we speak of these things, since some of our divine instructors in holy  things, affirm that the Super-good and Super-divine self-existent Goodness and Deity,  is Mainstay even of the self-existent Goodness and Deity; affirming that the good-making  and deifying gift issued forth from God; and that the self-existent beautifying  stream, is self-existent beauty, and whole beauty, and partial beauty, and things  absolutely beautiful, and things partially beautiful, and whatever other things  are said and shall be said after the same fashion, which declare that providences  and goodnesses issuing forth from God the unparticipating, in an ungrudging stream,  are participated by existing things, and bubble over in order that distinctly the  Cause of all may be beyond all, and the Superessential and Supernatural may, in  every respect, be above things of any sort of essence and nature whatever.</p>
