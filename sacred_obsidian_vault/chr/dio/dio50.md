 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iv.ii.vii"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p0.1"></a>CAPUT VII.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p1"></a>Concerning the Seraphim and Cherubim and Thrones, and concerning  their first Hierarchy.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.vii-p3"></a>We, whilst admitting this as the arrangement of the holy Hierarchies,  affirm, that every appellation of the celestial Minds denotes the Godlike characteristic  of each; and those who know Hebrew affirm, that the holy designation of the Seraphim  denotes either that they are kindling or burning; and that of Cherubim, a fulness  of knowledge or stream of wisdom. Naturally, then, the first (order) of the Heavenly  Hierarchies is ministered by the most exalted Beings, holding, as it does, a rank  which is higher than all, from the fact, that it is established immediately around  God, and that the first-wrought Divine manifestations and perfections pass earlier  to  <a name="page_25"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 25</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.vii-Page_25"></a> it, as being nearest. They are called, then, "Burning," and Thrones, and  Stream of Wisdom--by a name which sets forth their Godlike conditions. The appellation  of Seraphim plainly teaches their ever moving around things Divine, and constancy,  and warmth, and keenness, and the seething of that persistent, indomitable, and  inflexible perpetual motion, and the vigorous assimilation and elevation of the  subordinate, as giving new life and rekindling them to the same heat; and purifying  through fire and burnt-offering, and the light-like and light-shedding characteristic  which can never be concealed or consumed, and remains always the same, which destroys  and dispels every kind of obscure darkness. But the appellation of the Cherubim  denotes their knowledge and their vision of God, and their readiness to receive  the highest gift of light, and their power of contemplating the super-Divine comeliness  in its first revealed power, and their being filled anew with the impartation which  maketh wise, and their ungrudging communication to those next to them, by the stream  of the given wisdom. The appellation of the most exalted and pre-eminent Thrones  denotes their manifest exaltation above every grovelling inferiority, and their  supermundane tendency towards higher things; and their unswerving separation from  all remoteness; and their invariable and firmly-fixed settlement around the veritable  Highest, with the whole force of their powers; and their receptivity of the supremely  Divine approach, in the absence of all passion and earthly  <a name="page_26"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 26</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.vii-Page_26"></a> tendency, and their bearing God; and the ardent expansion of themselves for  the Divine receptions.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p4"></a>Section II.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.vii-p5"></a>This, then, is the revelation of their names, so far as we can  give it; and we ought to say what we think their Hierarchy is. For I suppose we  have sufficiently shewn above, that the purpose of every Hierarchy is an unswerving  devotion to the divine imitation of the Divine Likeness, and that every Hierarchical  function is set apart for the sacred reception and distribution of an undefiled  purification, and Divine Light, and perfecting science.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.vii-p6"></a>And now I pray that I may speak worthily of the most exalted Minds--how  the Hierarchy amongst them is exhibited through the Oracles.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.vii-p7"></a>One must consider, then, that the Hierarchy is akin, and in every  respect like, to the first Beings, who are established after the Godhead, who gave  them Being, and who are marshalled, as it were, in Its very vestibule, who surpass  every unseen and seen created power. We must then regard them as pure, not as though  they had been freed from unholy stains and blemishes, nor yet as though they were  unreceptive of earthly fancies, but as far exalted above every stain of remissness  and every inferior holiness, as befits the highest degree of purity--established  above the most Godlike powers, and clinging unflinchingly to their own self-moved  and same-moved rank in their invariable love of God, conscious in no respect whatever  of any declivity to a worse  <a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 27</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.vii-Page_27"></a> condition, but having the unsullied fixity of their own Godlike identity--never  liable to fall, and always unmoved; and again, as "contemplative," not contemplators  of intellectual symbols as sensible, nor as being led to the Divine Being by the  varied texture of holy representations written for meditation, but as being filled  with all kinds of immaterial knowledge of higher light, and satiated, as permissible,  with the beautifying and original beauty of super-essential and thrice manifested  contemplation, and thus, being deemed worthy of the Communion with Jesus, they do  not stamp pictorially the deifying similitude in divinely-formed images, but, as  being really near to Him, in first participation of the knowledge of His deifying  illuminations; nay more, that the imitation of God is given to them in the highest  possible degree, and they participate, so far as is allowable to them, in His deifying  and philanthropic virtues, in the power of a first manifestation; and, likewise  as "perfected," not as being illuminated with an analytic science of sacred variety,  but as being filled with a first and pre-eminent deification, as beseems the most  exalted science of the works of God, possible in Angels. For, not through other  holy Beings, but being ministered from the very Godhead, by the immediate elevation  to It, by their power, and rank, surpassing all, they are both established near  the All-Holy without any shadow of turning, and are conducted for contemplation  to the immaterial and intelligible comeliness, as far as permissible, and are initiated  into the scientific  <a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.vii-Page_28"></a> methods of the works of God, as being first and around God, being ministered,  in the highest degree, from the very source of consecration.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p8"></a>Section III.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.vii-p9"></a>This, then, the theologians distinctly shew (viz.) that the subordinate  Orders of the Heavenly Beings are taught by the superior, in due order, the deifying  sciences; and that those who are higher than all are illuminated from Godhead itself,  as far as permissible, in revelations of the Divine mysteries. For they introduce  some of them as being religiously instructed, by those of a higher rank, that He,  Who was raised to Heaven as Man, is Lord of the Heavenly Powers and King of Glory;  and others, as questioning Jesus Himself, as desiring to be instructed in the science  of His Divine work on our behalf, and Jesus Himself teaching them immediately, and  shewing to them, at first hand, His beneficent work out of love to man. For "I,"  He says, "am speaking of righteousness and judgment of Salvation." Now I am astonished  that even the first of the Beings in Heaven, and so far above all, should reverently  strive after the supremely Divine illuminations, as intermediate Beings. For they  do not ask directly, "Wherefore are Thy garments red? " but they first raise  the question among themselves, shewing that they desire to learn, and crave the  deifying knowledge, and not anticipating the illumination given after a Divine procedure.  <a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.vii-Page_29"></a></p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.vii-p10"></a>The first Hierarchy, then, of the Heavenly Minds is purified,  and enlightened, and perfected, by being ministered from the very Author of initiation,  through its elevation to It immediately, being filled, according to its degree,  with the altogether most holy purification of the unproachable Light of the pre-perfect  source of initiation, unstained indeed by any remissness, and full of primal Light,  and perfected by its participation in first-given knowledge and science. But to  sum up, I may say this, not inappropriately, that the reception of the supremely  Divine Science is, both purification, and enlightenment, and perfecting,--purifying,  as it were, from ignorance, by the knowledge of the more perfect revelations imparted  to it according to fitness, and enlightening by the self-same Divine knowledge,  through which it also purifies, that which did not before contemplate the things  which are now made manifest through the higher illumination; and perfecting further,  by the self-same Light, through the abiding science of the mysteries made clearly  manifest.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.vii-p11"></a>Section IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.vii-p12"></a>This, then, according to my science, is the first rank of the  Heavenly Beings which encircle and stand immediately around God; and without symbol,  and without interruption, dances round His eternal knowledge in the most exalted  ever-moving stability as in Angels; viewing purely many and blessed contemplations,  and illuminated with simple  <a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.vii-Page_30"></a> and immediate splendours, and filled with Divine nourishment,--many indeed  by the first-given profusion, but one by the unvariegated and unifying oneness of  the supremely Divine banquet, deemed worthy indeed of much participation and co-operation  with God, by their assimilation to Him, as far as attainable, of their excellent  habits and energies, and knowing many Divine things pre-eminently, and participating  in supremely Divine science and knowledge, as is lawful. Wherefore the Word of God  has transmitted its hymns to those on earth, in which are Divinely shewn the excellency  of its most exalted illumination. For some of its members, to speak after sensible  perception, proclaim as a "voice of many waters," "Blessed is the glory of the Lord  from His place" and others cry aloud that frequent and most august hymn of God,  "Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord of Sabaoth, the whole earth is full of His glory." These  most excellent hymnologies of the supercelestial Minds we have already unfolded  to the best of our ability in the "Treatise concerning the Divine Hymns," and have  spoken sufficiently concerning them in that Treatise, from which, by way of remembrance,  it is enough to produce so much as is necessary to the present occasion, namely,  "That the first Order, having been illuminated, from this the supremely Divine goodness,  as permissible, in theological science, as a Hierarchy reflecting that Goodness  transmitted to those next after it," teaching briefly this, "That it is just and  right that the  <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.vii-Page_31"></a> august Godhead -- Itself both above praise, and all-praiseworthy--should  be known and extolled by the God-receptive minds, as is attainable; for they as  images of God are, as the Oracles say, the Divine places of the supremely Divine  repose; and further, that It is Monad and Unit tri-subsistent, sending forth His  most kindly forethought to all things being, from the super-heavenly Minds to the  lowest of the earth; as super-original Origin and Cause of every essence, and grasping  all things super-essentially in a resistless embrace.</p>
