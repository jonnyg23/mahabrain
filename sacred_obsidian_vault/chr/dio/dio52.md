 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The Works of Dionysius the Areopagite, tr. by John Parker, [1897], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="iv.ii.ix"></a> <h3 align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ix-p0.1"></a>CAPUT IX.</h3> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ix-p1"></a>Concerning the Principalities, Archangels, and Angels, and concerning  their last Hierarchy.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ix-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ix-p3"></a>There remains for our reverent contemplation a Division which  completes the Angelic Hierarchies,  <a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ix-Page_36"></a> that divided into the Godlike Principalities, Archangels, and Angels. And  I think it necessary, to declare first the meaning of their sacred appellations  to the best of my ability. For that of the Heavenly Principalities manifests their  princely and leading function, after the Divine example, with order religious and  most befitting the Princely, and their being wholly turned to the super-princely  Prince, and leading others in princely fashion, and being moulded, as far as possible,  to that prince-making Princedom Itself, and to manifest its superessential princely  order, by the regularity of the princely powers.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ix-p4"></a>Section II.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ix-p5"></a>The (Order) of the Holy Archangels is of the same rank with the  heavenly Principalities. For there is one Hierarchy and Division, as I said, of  them and the Angels. But since there is not a Hierarchy which does not possess first  and middle and last powers, the holy order of Archangels occupies the middle position  in the Hierarchy between the extremes, for it belongs alike to the most holy Principalities  and to the holy Angels; to the Principalities because it is turned in a princely  fashion to the superessential Princedom, and is moulded to It as far as attainable,  and unites the Angels after the fashion of its own well-regulated and marshalled  and invisible leadings; and it belongs to the Angels, because it is of the messenger  Order, receiving hierarchically the Divine illuminations from  <a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ix-Page_37"></a> the first powers, and announcing the same to the Angels in a godly manner,  and, through Angels, manifesting to us, in proportion to the religious aptitude  of each of the godly persons illuminated. For the Angels, as we have already said,  complete the whole series of Heavenly Minds, as being the last Order of the Heavenly  Beings who possess the Angelic characteristic; yea, rather, they are more properly  named Angels by us than those of higher degree, because their Hierarchy is occupied  with the more manifest, and is more particularly concerned with the things of the  world. For the very highest Order, as being placed in the first rank near the Hidden  One, we must consider as directing in spiritual things the second, hiddenly; and  that the second, which is composed of the holy Lordships and Powers and Authorities,  leads the Hierarchy of the Principalities and Archangels and Angels, more clearly  indeed than the first Hierarchy, but more hiddenly than the Order after it, and  the revealing order of the Principalities, Archangels, and Angels, presides, through  each other, over the Hierarchies amongst men, in order that the elevation, and conversion,  and communion, and union with God may be in due order; and, further, also that the  procession from God vouchsafed benignly to all the Hierarchies, and passing to all  in common, may be also with most sacred regularity. Hence, the Word of God has assigned  our Hierarchy to Angels, by naming Michael as Ruler of the Jewish people, and others  over other nations. For the  <a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ix-Page_38"></a> Most High established borders of nations according to number of Angels of  God.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ix-p6"></a>Section III.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ix-p7"></a>But if any one should say, "How then were the people of the Hebrews  alone conducted to the supremely Divine illuminations?" we must answer, that we  ought not to throw the blame of the other nations wandering after those which are  no gods upon the direct guidance of the Angels, but that they themselves, by their  own declension, fell away from the direct leading towards the Divine Being, through  self-conceit and self-will, and through their irrational veneration for things which  appeared to them worthy of God. Even the Hebrew people are said to have suffered  the same thing; for He says, "Thou I hast cast away knowledge of God, and hast gone  after thine own heart." For neither have we a life governed by necessity, nor on  account of the free will of those who are objects of providential care, are the  Divine rays of the providential illumination blunted; but the inaptitude of the  mental visions makes the overflowing light-gift of the paternal goodness, either  altogether unparticipated or inpenetrable to their resistance, or makes the participations  of the one fontal ray, diverse, small, or great, obscure, or brilliant, although  that ray is one and simple, and always the same and ever overflowing; for even if,  over the other nations (from  <a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ix-Page_39"></a> whom we also have emerged to that boundless and bounteous sea of Divine Light,  which is readily-expanded for the ready reception of all), certain not alien gods  were wont to preside; yet there is one Head of all, and to this, the Angels, who  religiously direct each nation, conduct those who follow them. Let us consider Melchizedek  as being a Hierarch, most dear to God; (not of gods which are not, but of the truly  most high God); for the godly-wise did not call Melchizedek simply dear to God,  but also Priest, in order that they may clearly shew to the wise, that not only  was he himself turned to the true God, but further that he was guide to others,  as Hierarch of the elevation to the true and only Godhead.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.ix-p8"></a>Section IV.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.ix-p9"></a>Let me also recall this to your Hierarchical judgment--that  both to Pharaoh, from the Angel who presided over the Egyptians, and to the  Babylonian Prince, from his own Angel, the watchful and ruling care of  the Providence and Lordship over all, was interpreted in visions; and for those  nations, the worshippers of the true God were appointed leaders, for the interpretation  of things shaped by Angelic visions revealed from God through Angels to holy men  akin to the Angels, Daniel and Joseph. For there is one Prince and Providence over  all. And never must we think that the Godhead is leader of Jews by lot, and that  Angels,  <a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ix-Page_40"></a> independently, or as of equal rank, or in opposition, or that certain other  gods, preside over the other nations. But that particular phrase of the Divine Word  must be accepted according to the following sacred intention; not as though God  had divided government amongst men, with other gods, or Angels, and had been elected  by lot to the government and leadership of Israel, but in this sense--whilst the  one Providence of Highest over all, assigned all mankind, savingly, to the directing  conduct of their own Angels, yet Israel, almost alone in comparison with all, turned  himself to the Light-gift, and recognition of the true Lord-Hence the Word of God,  as shewing that Israel elected himself for the worship of the true God, says this,  "He became Lord’s portion;" and as indicating that he was assigned equally with  the other nations, to one of the holy Angels, for the recognition, through him,  of the Head of all, said "That Michael became leader of the (Jewish) people," demonstrating  distinctly that there is one Providence of the whole, superessentially established  above all the powers, unseen and seen, and that all the Angels who preside over  each nation, elevate, as far as possible, those who follow them with a willing mind,  to It as their proper Head.  <a name="page_41"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 41</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.ix-Page_41"></a></p>
