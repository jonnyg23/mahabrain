 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.viii-p1"></a>Concerning Lordships and Powers and Authorities, and concerning  their middle Hierarchy.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.viii-p2"></a>Section I.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.viii-p3"></a>Let us now pass to the middle Order of the Heavenly Minds, gazing,  as far as we may, with supermundane eyes upon those Lordships, and the truly terrible  visions of the Divine Authorities and Powers. For each appellation of the Beings  above us manifests their God-imitating characteristics of the Divine Likeness. I  think, then, that the explanatory name of the Holy Lordships denotes a certain unslavish  elevation, free from all grovelling subserviency, as becomes the free, not submitting  itself in any way whatever to one of the tyrannical dissimilarities, as a cruel  Lordship; superior to every kind of cringing slavery, indomitable to every subserviency,  and elevated above every dissimilarity, ever aspiring to  <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.viii-Page_32"></a> the true Lordship, and source of Lordship; and moulding, as an image of goodness,  itself, and those after it, to its Lordly bearing, as attainable, turning itself  wholly to none of the things that vainly seem, but to the Lordly Being, and ever  sharing in the Lordly Likeness of God, to its utmost ability; and the appellation  of the Holy Powers denotes a certain courageous and unflinching virility, for all  those Godlike energies within them--not feebly weak for the reception of any of  the Divine illuminations vouchsafed to it--vigorously conducted to the Divine  imitation, not forsaking the Godlike movement through its own unmanliness, but unflinchingly  looking to the superessential and powerful-making power, and becoming a powerlike  image of this, as far as is attainable, and powerfully turned to this, as Source  of Power, and issuing forth to those next in degree, in gift of Power, and in likeness  to God; and that the appellation of the Holy Authorities, of the same rank as the  Divine Lordships and Powers, (denotes) the beautiful and unconfused good order,  with regard to the Divine receptions, and the discipline of the supermundane and  intellectual authority, not using the authoritative powers imperiously for base  purposes, but conducted indomitably, with good order, towards Divine things, and  conducting those after it benignly, and assimilated, as far as permissible, to the  Authoritative Source of authority, and making this visible, as is possible to Angels,  in the well-ordered ranks of the authoritative power within it. The middle Order  of the Heavenly Minds having these Godlike characteristics, is purified and illuminated  <a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.viii-Page_33"></a> and perfected in the manner described, by the Divine illuminations vouchsafed  to it at second hand, through the first Hierarchical Order, and passing through  this middle as a secondary manifestation.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.ii.viii-p4"></a>Section II.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.viii-p5"></a>No doubt, as regards that message, which is said to pass through  one angel to another, we may take it as a symbol of a perfecting completed from  afar, and obscured by reason of its passage to the second rank. For, as men skilled  in our sacred initiations say, the fulness of Divine things manifested directly  to ourselves is more perfecting than the Divine contemplations imparted through  others. Thus, I think, the immediate participation of the Angelic ranks elevated  in first degree to God, is more clear than those perfected through the instrumentality  of others. Wherefore by our sacerdotal tradition, the first Minds are named perfecting,  and illuminating, and purifying Powers of the subordinate, who are conducted, through  them, to the superessential Origin of all things, and participate, as far as is  permissible to them, in the consecrating purifications, and illuminations, and perfections.  For, this is divinely fixed absolutely by the Divine source of order that, through  the first, the second partake of the supremely Divine illuminations. This you will  find declared by the theologians in many ways. For, when the Divine and Paternal  Love towards man whilst chastening, in a startling manner, His people Israel, for  their religious preservation, after delivering them  <a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.viii-Page_34"></a> to terrible and savage nations for correction, by various leadings of His  guided people to better things, both liberated them from their misery, and mildly  led them back, through His compassion, to their former state of comfort; one of  the theologians, Zechariah, sees one of the first Angels, as I think, and near God,  (for the Angelic appellation is common, as I said, to them all), learning from God  Himself the comforting words, as they are called, concerning this matter; and another  Angel, of inferior rank, advancing to meet the first, as for reception and participation  of enlightenment: then, by him instructed in the Divine purpose as from a Hierarch,  and charged to reveal to the theologian that Jerusalem should be abundantly occupied  by a multitude of people. And another theologian, Ezekiel, says that this was righteously  ordained by the glorious Deity Itself, seated above the Cherubim. For Paternal Love  towards man, conducting Israel as we have said through chastisement to better things,  by a righteousness worthy of God, deemed right to separate the guilty from the guiltless.  This is first revealed to one after the Cherubim; him who was bound about the loins  with a sapphire, and wore displayed the robe coming down to the feet, as  a Hierarchical symbol. But the Divine Government enjoins the other Angels, who bore  the battle-axes, to be instructed from the former, as to the Divine judgment in  this matter. For, to one, He said that he should  <a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a> <a name="iv.ii.viii-Page_35"></a> go through the midst of Jerusalem, and place the sign upon the forehead of  the innocent men, but to the others; "Go into the city after him and strike, and  draw not back your eyes, but to every one upon whom is the sign draw not near."</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.ii.viii-p6"></a>What would any one say concerning the Angel, who said to Daniel,  "The word has gone forth?" or concerning him the first, who took the fire from the  midst of the Cherubim, or what is more remarkable than this for shewing the good  order amongst the Angels, that the Cherubim casts the fire into the hands of him  who wears the sacred vestment; or concerning Him Who called the most divine Gabriel,  and said to him, "Make this man understand the vision," or whatever else is recorded  by the holy theologians concerning the Godlike order of the Heavenly Hierarchies;  by being assimilated to which, as far as possible, the discipline of our Hierarchy  will have the Angelic comeliness, as it were, in reflection, moulded through it,  and conducted to the superessential Source of order in every Hierarchy.</p>
