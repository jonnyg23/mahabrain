 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p1"></a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p1.1"></a>I. Concerning things performed in the Muron, and concerning things  perfected in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p2"></a>So great and so beautiful are the intelligible visions of the most holy Synaxis,  which minister hierarchically, as we have often said, our participation in, and  collection towards, the One. But there is another perfecting Service of the same  rank, which our Leaders name "Initiation of Muron," by contemplating whose parts  in due order, in accordance with the sacred images, we shall thus be borne, by hierarchical  contemplations, to its Oneness through its parts.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p3"></a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p3.1"></a>II. Mysterion of Initiation of Muron <a name="fr_258"></a><a href="#fn_258"><font size="1">259</font></a>
 .</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p4"></a>In the same way as in the Synaxis, the orders of the imperfect are dismissed,  that is, after the hierarchical procession has made the whole circuit of the temple,  attended with fragrant incense; and the chanting of the Psalms, and.the reading  of the most Divine Oracles. Then the Hierarch takes the Muron and places it, veiled  under twelve sacred wings, upon the Divine Altar, whilst all cry aloud, with most  devout voice, the sacred melody of the inspiration of the God-rapt Prophets, and  when he has finished the prayer offered over it, he uses it,  <a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_111"></a>in the most holy mystic Rites of things  being hallowed, for almost every Hierarchical consecration.</p> 
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p5"></a><a name="iv.iii.iv-p5.1"></a>III. Contemplation.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p6"></a>Section I.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p7"></a>The elementary teaching, then, of this the perfecting service, through the things  done over the Divine Muron, shews this, in my judgment, that, that which is holy  and of sweet savour in the minds of devout men is covered, as with a veil, since  it Divinely enjoins upon holy men to have their beautiful and well-savoured assimilations  in virtue to the hidden God not seen for vain glory. For the hidden comeliness of  God is unsullied, and is sweet beyond conception, and manifested for spiritual contemplation  to the intellectual alone, through a desire to have the unsullied images of virtue  in souls of the same pattern. For by looking away from the undistorted and well  imitated image of the Godlike virtue to that contemplated and fragrant beauty, he  thus moulds and fashions it to the most beautiful imitation. And, as in the case  of sensible images, if the artist look without distraction upon the archetypal form,  not distracted by sight of anything else, or in any way divided in attention, he  will duplicate, if I may so speak, the very person that is being sketched, whoever  he may be, and will shew the reality in the likeness, and the archetype in the image,  and each in each, save the difference of substance; thus, to copyists who love the  beautiful  <a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_112"></a>in mind, the persistent and unflinching  contemplation of the sweet-savoured and hidden beauty will confer the unerring and  most Godlike appearance <a name="fr_259"></a><a href="#fn_259"><font size="1">260</font></a>
 . Naturally, then, the divine  copyists, who unflinchingly mould their own intellectual contemplation to the superessentially  sweet and contemplated comeliness, do. none of their divinely imitated virtues "to  be seen of men <a name="fr_260"></a><a href="#fn_260"><font size="1">261</font></a>
 , as the Divine text expresses it;  but reverently gaze upon the most holy things of the Church, veiled in the Divine  Muron as in a figure. Wherefore, these also, by religiously concealing that which  is holy and most Divine in virtue within their Godlike and God-engraved mind, look  away to the archetypal conception alone; for not only are they blind to things dissimilar,  but neither are they drawn down to gaze upon them. Wherefore, as becomes their character,  they do neither love things, merely seeming good and just, but those really being  such; nor do they look to opinion, upon which the multitude irrationally congratulate  themselves, but, after the Divine example, by distinguishing the good or evil as  it is in itself, they are Divine images of the most supremely Divine sweetness,  which, having the truly sweet within itself, is not turned to the anomalously seeming  of the multitude, moulding Its genuineness to the true images of Itself.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p8"></a>Section II.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p9"></a>Come, then, since we have viewed the exterior comeliness of the entirely beautiful  ministration, let  <a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_113"></a>us now look away to its more godly  beauty (whilst itself, by itself, has uncovered the veils), gazing upon its blessed  radiance, shedding its bright beams openly around, and filling us with the fragrance  unveiled to the contemplators. For the visible consecration of the Muron is neither  uncommunicated in, or unseen by those who surround the Hierarch, but, on the contrary,  by passing through to them, and fixing the contemplation above the many, is reverently  covered by them, and by Hierarchical direction kept from the multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p10"></a>For the splendour of things all holy, by shedding its light clearly and without  symbol to men inspired, as being congenial to the thing contemplated, and perfuming  their contemplating perceptions without; concealment, advances not yet in the same  way to the inferior, but by them as deep contemplators of the thing contemplated  is concealed under the enigmas of the wings, without ostentation, so that it may  not be defiled by the dissimilar; through which sacred enigmas the well-ordered  Ranks of the subordinate are conducted to the degree of holiness compatible with  their powers.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p11"></a>Section III.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p12"></a>The holy consecration, then, which we are now extolling, is, as I said, of the  perfecting rank and capacity of the Hierarchical functions. Wherefore our Divine  Leaders arranged the same, as being of the same rank and effect as the holy perfecting  of the Synaxis, with the same figures, for the most  <a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_114"></a> part, and with mystical regulations  and lections. And you may see in like manner the Hierarch bearing forward the sweet  perfume from the more holy place into the sacred precincts beyond, and teaching,  by the return to the same, that the participation in things Divine comes to all  holy persons, according to fitness, and is undiminished and altogether unmoved and  stands unchangeably in its identity, as beseems Divine fixity. In the same way the  Psalms and readings of the Oracles nurse the imperfect to a life-bringing adoption  of sons, and form a religious inclination in those who are possessed with accursed  spirits, and dispel the opposing fear and effeminacy from those possessed by a spirit  of unmanliness; shewing to them, according to their capacity, the highest pinnacle  of the Godlike habit and power, by aid of which they will, the rather, scare away  the opposing forces, and will take the lead in healing others; and, following the  example of God, they will, whilst unmoved from their own proper gifts, not only  be active against those opposing fears, but will themselves give activity to others;  and they also impart a religious habit to those who have changed from the worse  to a religious mind, so that they should not be again enslaved by evil, and purify  completely those who need to become altogether pure; and they lead the holy to the  Divine likenesses, and contemplations and communions belonging to themselves, and  so establish those who are entirely holy, in blessed and intelligible visions,  <a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_115"></a> fulfilling their uniform likeness of  the One, and making them one.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p13"></a>Section IV.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p14"></a>What, then, shall I say further? Is it not those Ranks already mentioned, which  are not entirely pure, that the present consecrating service excludes without distinction,  in the same way as the Synaxis, so that it is viewed by the holy alone, in figures,  and is contemplated and ministered, by the perfectly holy alone, immediately, through  hierarchical directions? Now it is superfluous, as I think, to run over, by the  same statements, these things already so often mentioned, and not to pass to the  next, viewing the Hierarch, devoutly holding the Divine Muron veiled under twelve  wings, and ministering the altogether holy consecration upon it. Let us then affirm  that the composition of the Muron is a composition of sweet-smelling materials,  which has in itself abundantly fragrant qualities, of which (composition) those  who partake become perfumed in proportion to the degree to which they partake of  its sweet savour. Now we are persuaded that the most supremely Divine Jesus is superessentially  of good savour, filling the contemplative part of ourselves by bequests of Divine  sweetness for contemplation. For if the reception of the sensible odours make to  feel joyous, and nourishes, with much sweetness, the sensitive organs of our nostrils,  --if at least they be sound and well apportioned to the sweet savour--in the  same way any one might  <a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_116"></a> say that our contemplative faculties,  being soundly disposed as regards the subjection to the worse, in the strength of  the distinguishing faculty implanted in us by nature, receive the supremely Divine  fragrance, and are filled with a holy comfort and most Divine nourishment, in accordance  with Divinely fixed proportions, and the correlative turning of the mind towards  the Divine Being. Wherefore, the symbolical composition of the Muron, as expressing  in form things that are formless, depicts to us Jesus Himself, as a well-spring  of the wealth of the Divine sweet receptions, distributing, in degrees supremely  Divine, for the most Godlike of the contemplators, the most Divine perfumes; upon  which the Minds, joyfully refreshed, and filled with the holy receptions, indulge  in a feast of spiritual contemplation, by the entrance of the sweet bequests into  their contemplative part, as beseems a Divine participation.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p15"></a>Section V.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p16"></a>Now it is evident, as I think, that the distribution of the fontal perfume to  the Beings above ourselves, who are more Divine, is, as it were, nearer, and manifests  and distributes itself more to the transparent and wholesome mental condition of  their receptive faculty, overflowing ungrudgingly and entering in many fashions;  but as regards the subordinate contemplators, which are not so receptive, piously  concealing the highest vision and  <a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_117"></a>participation, it is distributed in  a supremely Divine proportion, in fragrance corresponding to the recipients. Amongst  the holy Beings, then, who are above us, the superior order of the Seraphim is represented  under the figure of the twelve wings, established and fixed around Jesus, casting  itself upon the most blessed contemplations of Him, as far as permissible, and filled  reverently with the contemplated truth distributed in most pure receptions, and,  to speak after the manner of men, crying aloud, with never silent lips, the frequent  Hymn of Praise; for the sacred knowledge of the supermundane minds is both untiring,  and possesses the Divine love without intermission, and is at the same time superior  to all baseness and forgetfulness. Hence, as I think, that phrase, "unceasing cry,"  suggests their perpetual and persistent science and conception of things Divine,  with full concord and thanksgiving.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p17"></a>Section VI.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p18"></a>Now we have, as I think, sufficiently contemplated, in the description of the  super-heavenly Hierarchy, the incorporeal properties of the Seraphim, Divinely described  in the Scriptures under sensible figures explanatory of the contemplated Beings,  and we have made them evident to thy contemplating eyes. Nevertheless, since now  also they who stand reverently around the Hierarch,  <a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_118"></a>reflect the highest Order, on a small  scale, we will now view with most immaterial visions their most Godlike splendour.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p19"></a>Section VII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p20"></a>Their numberless faces then, and many feet, manifest, as I think, their property  of viewing the most Divine illuminations from many sides, and their conception of  the good things of God as ever active and abundantly receptive; and the sixfold  arrangement of the wings, of which the Scripture speaks, does not, I think, denote,  as seems to some, a sacred number, but that of the highest Essence and Order around  God; the first and middle and last of its contemplative and Godlike powers are altogether  elevating, free, and supermundane. Hence the most holy wisdom of the Oracles, when  reverently describing the formation of the wings, places the wings around their  heads <a name="fr_261"></a><a href="#fn_261"><font size="1">262</font></a>
 , and middle, and feet; suggesting their complete  covering with wings, and their manifold faculty of leading to the Really Being.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p21"></a>Section VIII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p22"></a>Now if they cover their faces and their feet, and fly by their middle wings only,  bear this reverently in mind, that the Order, so far exalted above the highest beings,  is circumspect respecting the more lofty and deep of its conceptions, and raises  itself,  <a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 119</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_119"></a>in due proportion, by its middle wings,  to the vision of God, by placing its own proper life under the Divine yokes, and  by these is reverently directed to the judgment of itself.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p23"></a>Section IX.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p24"></a>And, as regards the statement of Holy Scripture, that "one cried out to the other,"  that shews, I think, that they impart to each other ungrudgingly their own visions  of God. And this we should deem worthy of religious recollection, that the Hebrew  word in the Holy Scriptures names the most holy Beings of the Seraphim by an explanatory  epithet, from their glowing and seething in a Divine and ever-moving life.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p25"></a>Section X.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p26"></a>Since, then, as those who understand Hebrew say, the most Divine Seraphim were  named by the Word of God, "Kindling" and "Heating," by a name expressive of their  essential condition, they possess, according to the symbolical imagery of the Divine  Muron, most elevating powers, which call it to manifestation and distribution of  most exhilarating perfumes. For the Being, sweet beyond conception, loves to be  moved by the glowing and most pure minds into manifestation, and imparts Its most  Divine inspirations, in cheerful distributions, to those who thus supermundanely  call It forth. Thus the most Divine Order of supercelestial Beings did  <a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_120"></a>not fail to recognize the most supremely Divine  Jesus, when He descended for the purpose of being sanctified; but recognizes, reverently,  Him lowering Himself in our belongings, through Divine and inexpressible goodness;  and when viewing Him sanctified, in a manner befitting man, by the Father and Himself  and the Holy Spirit, recognized its own supreme Head as being essentially unchanged,  in whatever He may do as supreme God. Hence the tradition of the sacred symbols  places the Seraphim near the Divine Muron, when it is being consecrated, recognizing  and describing the Christ as unchanged, in our complete manhood in very truth. And  what is still more divine is, that it uses the Divine Muron for the consecration  of every thing sacred, distinctly shewing, according to the Logion, the Sanctified  Sanctifying, as always being the same with Himself throughout the whole supremely  Divine sanctification. Wherefore also the consecrating gift and grace of the Divine  Birth in God is completed in the most Divine perfectings of the Muron. Whence, as  I think, the Hierarch pouring the Muron upon the purifying font in cruciform injections,  brings to view, for contemplative eyes, the Lord Jesus descending even to death  itself through the cross, for our Birth in God, benevolently drawing up, from the  old gulping of the destructive death, by the same Divine and resistless descent,  those, who, according to the  <a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_121"></a> mysterious saying, "are baptized into  His death," and renewing them to a godly and eternal existence.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p27"></a>Section XI.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p28"></a>But further, the perfecting unction of the Muron gives to him who has been initiated  in the most sacred initiation of the Birth in God, the abiding of the supremely  Divine Spirit; the sacred imagery of the symbols, portraying, as I think, the most  Divine Spirit abundantly supplied by Him, Who, for our sakes, has been sanctified  as man by the supremely Divine Spirit, in an unaltered condition of His essential  Godhead.</p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="iv.iii.iv-p29"></a>Section XII.</p>  
 <p><a name="iv.iii.iv-p30"></a>And bear this also hierarchically in mind, that the Law of the most pure initiation  completes the sacred consecration of the Divine Altar, by the all pure effusions  of the most holy Muron. And the supercelestial and superessential contemplation  is source and essence, and perfecting power, of all our deifying holiness. For if  our most Divine Altar is Jesus--the supremely Divine sanctifying of the Godly  Minds --in Whom, according to the Logion, "being sanctified and mystically offered  as a whole burnt-offering, we have the access," let us gaze with supermundane eyes  upon the most Divine Altar itself (in which things being perfected, are perfected  and sanctified), being perfected from the most Divine Muron itself; for  <a name="page_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_122"></a> the altogether most holy Jesus sanctifies  Himself on our behalf, and fills us full of every sanctification, since the things  consecrated upon them pass fraternally afterwards in their beneficent effects to  us, as children of God. Hence, as I think, the Divine Leaders of our Hierarchy,  in conformity with a Hierarchical conception divinely transmitted, name this altogether  august ministration "consecration of Muron," from "being consecrated thoroughly,"  as one might say, "consecration of God," extolling its divine consecrating work  in each sense. For both the being sanctified for our sakes, as becomes Man, and  the consecrating all things as supreme God, and the sanctifying things being consecrated,  is "consecration of Him." As for the sacred song of the inspiration of the God-rapt  Prophets, it is called by those who know Hebrew, the "Praise of God," or "Praise  ye the Lord," for since every divine manifestation and work of God is reverently  portrayed in the varied composition of the Hierarchical symbols, it is not unfitting  to mention the Divinely moved song of the Prophets; for it teaches at once, distinctly  and reverently, that the beneficent works of the Divine Goodness are worthy of devout  praise.  <a name="page_123"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 123</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.iv-Page_123"></a></p>
