 </i><p>Salome's lessons. Prayer. Elihu's concluding lessons. Sums up the three years' course of study. The pupils return to their homes.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Now, when the morning sun arose the masters and their pupils all were in the sacred grove.<br> <b>2. </b>Salome was the first to speak; she said, Behold the sun! It manifests the power of God who speaks to us through sun and moon and stars;<br> <b>3. </b>Through mountain, hill and vale; through flower, and plant and tree.<br> <b>4. </b>God sings for us through bird, and harpsichord, and human voice; he speaks to us through wind and rain and thunder roll; why should we not bow down and worship at his feet?<br> <b>5. </b>God speaks to hearts apart; and hearts apart must speak to him; and this is prayer.<br> <b>6. </b>It is not prayer to shout at God, to stand, or sit, or kneel and tell him all about the sins of men.<br> <b>7. </b>It is not prayer to tell the Holy One how great he is, how good he is, how strong and how compassionate.<br> <b>8. </b>God is not man to be bought up by praise of man.<br> <b>9. </b>Prayer is the ardent wish that every way of life be light; that every act be crowned with good; that every living thing be prospered by our ministry.<br> <b>10. </b>A noble deed, a helpful word is prayer; a fervent, an effectual prayer.<br> <b>11. </b>The fount of prayer is in the heart; by thought, not words, the heart is carried up to God, where it is blest, Then let us pray.<br> <b>12. </b>They prayed, but not a word was said; but in that holy Silence every heart was blest.<br> <b>13. </b>And then Elihu spoke. He said to Mary and Elizabeth, Our words are said; you need not tarry longer here; the call has come; the way is clear, you may return unto your native land.<br> <b>14. </b>A mighty work is given you to do; you shall direct the minds that will direct the world.<br> <b>15. </b>Your sons are set apart to lead men up to righteous thoughts, and words, and deeds;<br> <b>16. </b>To make men know the sinfulness of sin; to lead them from the adoration of the lower self, and all illusive things, and make them conscious of the self that lives with Christ in God.<br> <b>17. </b>In preparation for their work your sons must walk in many thorny paths.<br> <b>18. </b>Fierce trials and temptations they will meet, like other men; their loads will not be light, and they will weary be, and faint.<br> <b>19. </b>And they will know the pangs of hunger and of thirst; and without cause they will be mocked, imprisoned, scourged.<br> <b>20. </b>To many countries they will go, and at the feet of many masters they will sit, for they must learn like other men.<br> <b>21. </b>But we have said enough. The blessings of the Three and of the Seven, who stand before the throne, will surely rest upon you evermore.<br> <b>22. </b>Thus closed the lessons of Elihu and Salome. Three years they taught their pupils in the sacred grove, and if their lessons all were written in a book, lo, it would be a mighty book; of what they said we have the sum.<br> <b>23. </b>Now, Mary, Joseph and Elizabeth with Jesus and his harbinger, set forth upon their homeward way. They went not by Jerusalem, for Archelaus reigned.<br> <b>24. </b>They journeyed by the Bitter Sea, and when they reached Engedi hills they rested in the home of Joshua, a near of kin; and here Elizabeth and John abode.<br> <b>25. </b>But Joseph, Mary and their son went by the Jordan way, and after certain days they reached their home in Nazareth.</p>
