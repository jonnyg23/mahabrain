 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 50</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus passes the third brotherhood test, and receives the third degree, FAITH.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The Logos waited seven days, and then was taken to the Hall of Fame, a chamber rich in furnishings, and lighted up with gold and silver lamps.<br> <b>2. </b>The colours of its ceilings, decorations, furnishings and walls were blue and gold.<br> <b>3. </b>Its shelves were filled with books of master minds; the paintings and the statues were the works of highest art.<br> <b>4. </b>And Jesus was entranced with all this elegance and these manifests of thought. He read the sacred books, and sought the meanings of the symbols and the hieroglyphs.<br> <b>5. </b>And when he was absorbed in deepest thought, a priest approached and said,<br> <b>6. </b>Behold the glory of this place: my brother, you are highly blest. Few men of earth, so young, have reached such heights of fame.<br> <b>7. </b>Now, if you do not waste your life in search for hidden things that men can never comprehend, you may be founder of a school of thought that will insure you endless fame;<br> <b>8. </b>For your philosophy is deeper far than that of Plato, and your teachings please the common people more than those of Socrates.<br> <b>9. </b>Why seek for mystic light within these antiquated dens? Go forth and walk with men, and think with men, and they will honour you.<br> <b>10. </b>And, after all, these weird initiations may be myths, and your Messiah hopes but base illusions of the hour.<br> <b>11. </b>I would advise you to renounce uncertain things and choose the course that leads to certain fame.<br> <b>12. </b>And thus the priest, a demon in disguise, sung syren songs of unbelief; and Jesus meditated long and well on what he said.<br> <b>13. </b>The conflict was a bitter one, for king Ambition is a sturdy foe to fight.<br> <b>14. </b>For forty days the higher wrestled with the lower self, and then the fight was won.<br> <b>15. </b>Faith rose triumphant; unbelief was not. Ambition covered up his face and fled away, and Jesus said,<br> <b>16. </b>The wealth, the honour, and the fame of earth are but the baubles of an hour.<br> <b>17. </b>When this short span of earthly life has all been measured out, man's bursting baubles will be buried with his bones,<br> <b>18. </b>Yea, what a man does for his selfish self will make no markings on the credit side of life.<br> <b>19. </b>The good that men for other men shall do becomes a ladder strong on which the soul may climb to wealth, and power and fame of God's own kind, that cannot pass away.<br> <b>20. </b>Give me the poverty of men, the consciousness of duty done in love, the approbation of my God, and I will be content.<br> <b>21. </b>And then he lifted up his eyes to heaven and said,<br> <b>22. </b>My Father-God, I thank thee for this hour. I ask not for the glory of thyself; I fain would be a keeper of thy temple gates, and serve my brother man.<br> <b>23. </b>Again was Jesus called to stand before the hierophant; again no word was said, but in his hands the master placed a scroll on which was written, FAITH.<br> <b>24. </b>And Jesus bowed his head in humble thanks; then went his way.</p>
