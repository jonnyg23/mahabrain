 <p></p> <h4>SECTION XII<br> <br> LAMED<br> <br> The Council of the Seven Sages of the World</h4> <h4>Chapter 56</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The seven sages of the world meet in Alexandria. The purposes of the meeting. The opening addresses.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>In every age since time began have seven sages lived.<br> <b>2. </b>At first of every age these sages meet to note the course of nations, peoples, tribes and tongues;<br> <b>3. </b>To note how far toward justice, love and righteousness the race has gone;<br> <b>4. </b>To formulate the code of laws, religious postulates and plans of rule best suited to the coming age.<br> <b>5. </b>An age had passed, and lo, another age had come; the sages must convene.<br> <b>6. </b>Now, Alexandria was the centre of the world's best thought, and here in Philo's home the sages met.<br> <b>7. </b>From China came Meng-ste; from India Viyapati came; from Persia Kaspar came; and from Assyria Ashbina came; from Greece Apollo; Matheno was the Egyptian sage, and Philo was the chief of Hebrew thought.<br> <b>8. </b>The time was due; the council met and sat in silence seven days.<br> <b>9. </b>And then Meng-ste arose and said, The wheel of time has turned once more; the race is on a higher plane of thought.<br> <b>10. </b>The garments that or fathers wove have given out; the cherubim have woven a celestial cloth; have placed it in our hands and we must make for men new garbs.<br> <b>11. </b>The sons of men are looking up for greater light. No longer do they care for gods hewn out of wood, or made of clay. They seek a Gob not made with hands.<br> <b>12. </b>They see the beams of coming day, and yet they comprehend them not.<br> <b>13. </b>The time is ripe, and we must fashion well these garments for the race.<br> <b>14. </b>And let us make for men new garbs of justice, mercy, righteousness and love, that they may hide their nakedness when shines the light of coming day.<br> <b>15. </b>And Vidyapati said, Our priests have all gone mad; they saw a demon in the wilds and at him cast their lamps and they are broken up, and not a gleam of light has any priest for men.<br> <b>16. </b>The night is dark; the heart of India calls for light.<br> <b>17. </b>The priesthood cannot be reformed; it is already dead; its greatest needs are graves and funeral chants.<br> <b>18. </b>The new age calls for liberty; the kind that makes each man a priest, enables him to go alone, and lay his offerings on the shrine of God.<br> <b>19. </b>And Kaspar said, In Persia people walk in fear; they do the good for fear to do the wrong.<br> <b>20. </b>The devil is the greatest power in our land, and though a myth, he dandles on his knee both youth and age.<br> <b>21. </b>Our land is dark, and evil prospers in the dark.<br> <b>22. </b>Fear rides on every passing breeze, and lurks in every form of life.<br> <b>23. </b>The fear of evil is a myth, is an illusion and a snare; but it will live until some mighty power shall come to raise the ethers to the plane of light.<br> <b>24. </b>When this shall come to pass the magian land will glory in the light. The soul of Persia calls for light.</p>
