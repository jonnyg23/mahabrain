 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 104</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus teaches the multitudes. Attends a feast in Simon's house. A wealthy courtesan anoints him with precious balm. Simon rebukes him and he preaches a sermon on false respectability.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>And Jesus looked upon the multitudes who pressed about for selfish gain.<br> <b>2. </b>The men of learning and of wealth, of reputation and of power, were there; but they knew not the Christ.<br> <b>3. </b>Their eyes were blinded by the tinselled glitter of their selfish selves; they could not see the king.<br> <b>4. </b>And though they walked within the light, they groped about in dark--a darkness like the night of death.<br> <b>5. </b>And Jesus cast his eyes to heaven and said,<br> <b>6. </b>I thank thee, Holy One of heaven and earth, that while the light is hidden from the wise and great, it is revealed to babes.<br> <b>7. </b>Then turning to the multitudes he said, I come to you not in the name of man, nor in a strength my own;<br> <b>8. </b>The wisdom and the virtue that I bring to you are from above; they are the wisdom and the virtue of the God whom we adore.<br> <b>9. </b>The words I speak are not my words; I give to you what I receive.<br> <b>10. </b>Come unto me all you who labour and pull heavy loads and I will give you aid.<br> <b>11. </b>Put on the yoke of Christ with me; it does not chafe; it is an easy yoke.<br> <b>12. </b>Together we will pull the load of life with ease; and so rejoice.<br> <b>13. </b>A Pharisee, whose name was Simon, made a feast, and Jesus was the honoured guest.<br> <b>14. </b>And as they sat about the board, a courtesan who had been cured of her desire to sin by what she had received and seen in Jesus' ministry, came uninvited to the feast.<br> <b>15. </b>She brought an alabaster box of costly balm and as the guests reclined she came to Jesus in her joy, because she been freed from sin.<br> <b>16. </b>Her tears fell fast, she kissed his feet, and dried them with her hair, and she anointed them with balm.<br> <b>17. </b>And Simon thought, he did not speak aloud, This man is not a prophet or he would know the kind of woman that approaches him, and would drive her away.<br> <b>18. </b>But Jesus knew his thoughts, and said to him, My host, I have a word to say to you.<br> <b>19. </b>And Simon said, Say on.<br> <b>20. </b>And Jesus said, Sin is a monster of iniquity; it may be small; it may be large; it may be something left undone.<br> <b>21. </b>Behold, one person leads a life of sin and is at last redeemed; another, in a careless mood, forgets to do the things he ought to do but he reforms and is forgiven. Now, which of these has merited the higher praise?<br> <b>22.</b> And Simon said, The one who overcame the error of a life.<br> <b>23. </b>And Jesus said, You speak the truth.<br> <b>24. </b>Behold this woman who has bathed my feet with tears and dried them with her hair and covered them with balm!<br> <b>25. </b>For years she led a life of sin, but when she heard the words of life she sought forgiveness and she found.<br> <b>26. </b>But when I came into your house as guest you gave me not a bowl of water that I might wash my hands and feet, which every loyal Jew must do before he feasts.<br> <b>27. </b>Now, tell me, Simon, which of these, this woman or yourself, is worthy of most praise?<br> <b>28. </b>But Simon answered not.<br> <b>29. </b>Then to the woman Jesus said, Your sins are all forgiven; your faith has saved you; go in peace.<br> <b>30. </b>And then the guests who sat around the board, began to say within themselves, What manner of a man is this who says, Thy sins are all forgiven?</p>
