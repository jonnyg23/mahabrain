 <p></p> <h4>SECTION XVII<br> <br> PE<br> <br> The Third Annual Epoch of the Christine Ministry of Jesus</h4> <h4>Chapter 124</h4> <i>
 </i><p>The Christines cross the sea. Jesus gives to his disciples lessons on secret doctrines. Teaches the people. Feeds five thousand. The disciples start to recross the sea. A storm arises. Jesus, walking on the waters, comes to them. Trial of Peter's faith. They land in Gennesaret.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The twelve apostles now had reached the stage of spirit consciousness, and Jesus could reveal to them the deeper meanings of his mission to the world.<br> <b>2. </b>Next week the great feast of the Jews would be observed, and Matthew said, Shall we not gird ourselves and go unto Jerusalem?<br> <b>3. </b>But Jesus said, We will not go up to the feast; the time is short and I have many things to say to you; come you apart into a desert place and rest a while.<br> <b>4. </b>And then they took their boats and crossed the sea, and came into a desert place near Julius Bethsaida.<br> <b>5. </b>The people saw them go, and in vast multitudes they followed them.<br> <b>6. </b>And Jesus had compassion on the anxious throng, and he stood forth and taught them all the day, because they sought a light and were like sheep without a fold.<br> <b>7. </b>And as the night came on the twelve were doubting what the multitudes would do, and Thomas said,<br> <b>8. </b>Lord, we are in a desert place; the multitudes have naught to eat and they are faint from lack of food; what shall we do?<br> <b>9. </b>And Jesus said, Go to and feed the multitudes.<br> <b>10. </b>And Judas said, Shall we go down and buy two hundred pennies' worth of bread for them to eat?<br> <b>11. </b>And Jesus, Go look into our larder and see how many loaves we have.<br> <b>12. </b>And Andrew said, We have no bread, but we have found a lad who has five barley loaves and two small fish; but this would not be food enough for one in ten.<br> <b>13. </b>But Jesus said, Command these people all to sit upon the grass in companies of twelve; and they all sat down in companies of twelve.<br> <b>14. </b>Then Jesus took the loaves and fish, and looking up to heaven he spoke the sacred Word.<br> <b>15. </b>And then he broke the bread and gave it to the twelve; he also gave the fish unto the twelve, and said, Go to and feed the multitudes.<br> <b>16. </b>And all the people ate and were refreshed.<br> <b>17. </b>There were about five thousand men, a company of little ones, and women not a few.<br> <b>18. </b>And when the people all were filled the master said,<br> <b>19. </b>Let not a crumb be lost; Go to and gather up the pieces of the bread and fish for others that may want.<br> <b>20. </b>They gathered up the fragments and they filled twelve baskets full.<br> <b>21. </b>The people were bewildered by this wondrous act of power; they said, And now we know that Jesus is the prophet that our prophets said would come; and then they said, All hail the king!<br> <b>22. </b>Whne Jesus heard them say, All hail the king! he called the twelve and bade them take their boats and go before him to the other side;<br> <b>23. </b>And he went all alone into a mountain pass to pray.<br> <b>24. </b>The twelve were on the sea and hoped to reach Capernaum in just a little time, when all at once a fearful storm arose, and they were at the mercy of the waves.<br> <b>25. </b>And in the fourth watch of the night the wind became a whirling wind, and they were filled with fear.<br> <b>26. </b>And in the blinding storm they saw a form move on the waves; it seemed to be a man, one spoke out and said, It is a ghost, a sign of evil things.<br> <b>27. </b>But John discerned the form and said, It is the Lord.<br> <b>28. </b>And then the wind blew not so hard, and Peter, standing in the midst, exclaimed:<br> <b>29. </b>My Lord! my Lord! If this be truly you, bid me to come to you upon the waves.<br> <b>30. </b>The form reached forth his hand and said, Come on.<br> <b>31. </b>And Peter stepped upon the waves and they were solid as a rock; he walked upon the waves.<br> <b>32. </b>He walked until he thought within himself, What if the waves should break beneath my feet?<br> <b>33. </b>And then the waves did break beneath his feet, and he began to sink, and in the fearfulness of soul he cried, O save me, Lord, or I am lost!<br> <b>34. </b>And Jesus took him by the hand and said, O you of little faith! why did you doubt? And Jesus led the way unto the boat.<br> <b>35. </b>The storm had spent its force; the winds were still, and they were near the shore, and when they landed they were in the valley of Gennesaret.</p>
