 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 73</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus again visits the temple, and is favourably received by the people. Tells the parable of a king and his sons. Defines messiahship.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Next day the multitudes were surging through the temple courts, intent on hearing Jesus speak.<br> <b>2. </b>And when he came the people said, All hail! behold the king!<br> <b>3. </b>And Jesus spoke a parable; he said, A king had vast domains; his people all were kin, and lived in peace.<br> <b>4. </b>Now, after many years the king said to his people, Take these lands and all I have; enhance their values; rule yourselves, and live in peace.<br> <b>5. </b>And then the people formed their states; selected governors and petty kings.<br> <b>6. </b>But pride, ambition, selfish greed, and base ingratitude grew fast, and kings began to war.<br> <b>7. </b>They wrote in all their statute books that might is right; and then the strong destroyed the weak, and chaos reigned through all the vast domain.<br> <b>8. </b>A long time passed, and then the king looked out on his domain. He saw his people in their cruel wars; he saw them sick and sore distressed; he saw the strong enslave the weak,<br> <b>9. </b>And then he said, What shall I do? Shall I send forth a scourge? shall I destroy my people all?<br> <b>10. </b>And then his heart was stirred with pity and he said, I will not send a scourge; I will send forth my only son, heir to the throne, to teach the people love, and peace, and righteousness.<br> <b>11. </b>He sent his son; the people scorned him and maltreated him, and nailed him to a cross.<br> <b>12. </b>He was entombed; but death was far too weak to hold the prince, and he arose.<br> <b>13. </b>He took a form man could not kill; and then he went again to teach the people love, and peace and righteousness.<br> <b>14. </b>And thus God deals with men.<br> <b>15. </b>A lawyer came and asked, What does messiah mean? and who has right to make messiah of a man?<br> <b>16. </b>And Jesus said, Messiah is one sent from God to seek and save the lost. Messiahs are not made by men.<br> <b>17. </b>In first of every age Messiah comes to light the way; to heal up broken hearts; to set the prisoners free. Messiah and the Christ are one.<br> <b>18. </b>Because a man claims to be Christ is not a sign that he is Christ.<br> <b>19. </b>A man may cause the streams to flow from flinty rocks; may bring storms at will; may stay tempestuous winds; may heal the sick and raise the dead, and not be sent from God.<br> <b>20. </b>All nature is subservient to the will of man, and evil man, as well as good, have all the powers of mind, and may control the elements.<br> <b>21. </b>The head gives not the proof of true messiahship, for man by means of intellect, can never know of God, nor bring himself to walk in light.<br> <b>22. </b>Messiah lives not in the head, but in the heart, the seat of mercy and of love.<br> <b>23. </b>Messiah never works for selfish gains; he stands above the carnal self; his words and deeds are for the universal good.<br> <b>24. </b>Messiah never tries to be a king, to wear a crown and sit upon an earthly throne.<br> <b>25. </b>The king is earthy, of the earth; Messiah is the man from heaven.<br> <b>26. </b>And then the lawyer asked, Why do you pose as king?<br> <b>27. </b>And Jesus said, No man has ever heard me say that I am king. I could not sit in Cæsar's place and be the Christ.<br> <b>28. </b>Give unto Cæsar what belongs to him; give unto God the treasures of your heart.</p>
