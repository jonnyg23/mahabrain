 <p></p> <h4>SECTION X<br> <br> JOD<br> <br> Life and Works of Jesus in Greece</h4> <h4>Chapter 44</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus visits Greece and is welcomed by the Athenians. Meets Apollo. Addresses the Grecian masters in the Amphitheatre. The address.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The Greek philosophy was full of pungent truth, and Jesus longed to study with the masters in the schools of Greece.<br> <b>2. </b>And so he left his home in Nazareth and crossed the Carmel hills, and at the port took ship, and soon was in the Grecian capital.<br> <b>3. </b>Now, the Athenians had heard of him as teacher and philosopher, and they were glad to have him come to them that they might hear his words of truth.<br> <b>4. </b>Among the masters of the Greeks was one, Apollo, who was called, Defender of the Oracle, and recognised in many lands as Grecian sage.<br> <b>5. </b>Apollo opened up for Jesus all the doors of Grecian lore, and in the Areopagus he heard the wisest masters speak.<br> <b>6. </b>But Jesus brought to them a wisdom greater far than theirs; and so he taught.<br> <b>7. </b>Once in the Amphitheatre he stood, and when Apollo bade him speak he said,<br> <b>8. </b>Athenian masters, hear! In ages long ago, men, wise in nature's laws, sought out and found the place on which your city stands.<br> <b>9. </b>Full well you know that there are parts of earth where its great beating heart throws heavenward etheric waves that meet the ethers from above:<br> <b>10. </b>Where spirit-light and understanding, like the stars of night, shine forth.<br> <b>11. </b>Of all the parts of earth there is no place more sensitised, more truly spirit-blest, than that where Athens stands.<br> <b>12. </b>Yea, all of Greece is blest. No other land has been the homeland of such mighty men of thought as grace your scrolls of fame.<br> <b>13. </b>A host of sturdy giants of philosophy, of poetry, of science, and of art, were born upon the soil of Greece, and rocked to manhood in your cradle of pure thought.<br> <b>14. </b>I come not here to speak of science, of philosophy, or art; of these you are the world's best masters now.<br> <b>15. </b>But all your high accomplishments are but stepping stones to worlds beyond the realm of sense; are but illusive shadows flitting on the walls of time.<br> <b>16. </b>But I would tell you of a life beyond, within; a real life that cannot pass away.<br> <b>17. </b>In science and philosophy there is no power strong enough to fit a soul to recognise itself, or to commune with God.<br> <b>18. </b>I would not stay the flow of your great streams of thought; but I would turn them to the channels of the soul.<br> <b>19. </b>Unaided by the Spirit-breath, the work of intellection tends to solve the problems of the things we see, and nothing more.<br> <b>20. </b>The senses were ordained to bring into the mind mere pictures of the things that pass away; they do not deal with real things; they do not comprehend eternal law.<br> <b>21. </b>But man has something in his soul, a something that will tear the veil apart that he may see the world of real things.<br> <b>22. </b>We call this something, spirit consciousness; it sleeps in every soul, and cannot be awakened till the Holy Breath becomes a welcome guest.<br> <b>23. </b>This Holy Breath knocks at the door of every soul, but cannot enter in until the will of man throws wide the door.<br> <b>24. </b>There is no power in intellect to turn the key; philosophy and science both have toiled to get a glimpse behind the veil; but they have failed.<br> <b>25. </b>The secret spring that throws ajar the door of soul is touched by nothing else than purity in life, by prayer and holy thought.<br> <b>26. </b>Return, O mystic stream of Grecian thought, and mingle your clear waters with the flood of Spirit-life; and then the spirit consciousness will sleep no more, and man will know, and God will bless.<br> <b>27. </b>When Jesus had thus said he stepped aside. The Grecian masters were astonished at the wisdom of his words; they answered not.</p>
