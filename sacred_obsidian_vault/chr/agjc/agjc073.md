 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 70</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus and his disciples at a marriage feast in Cana. Jesus speaks on marriage. He turns water into wine. The people are amazed.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>In Cana, Galilee, there was a marriage feast, and Mary and her sister Miriam, and Jesus and his six disciples were among the guests.<br> <b>2. </b>The ruler of the feast had heard that Jesus was a master sent from God, and he requested him to speak.<br> <b>3. </b>And Jesus said, There is no tie more sacred than the marriage tie.<br> <b>4. </b>The chain that binds two souls in love is made in heaven, and man can never sever it in twain.<br> <b>5. </b>The lower passions of the twain may cause a union of the twain, a union as when oil and water meet.<br> <b>6. </b>And then a priest may forge a chain, and bind the twain. This is not marriage genuine; it is a counterfeit.<br> <b>7. </b>The twain are guilty of adultery; the priest is party to the crime. And that was all that Jesus said.<br> <b>8. </b>As Jesus stood apart in silent thought his mother came and said to him, The wine has failed; what shall we do?<br> <b>9. </b>And Jesus said, Pray what is wine? It is but water with the flavouring of grapes.<br> <b>10. </b>And what are grapes? They are but certain kinds of thought made manifest, and I can manifest that thought, and water will be wine.<br> <b>11. </b>He called the servants, and he said to them, Bring in six water pots of stone, a pot for each of these, my followers, and fill them up with water to the brims.<br> <b>12. </b>The servants brought the water pots, and filled them to their brims.<br> <b>13. </b>And Jesus with a mighty thought stirred up the ethers till they reached the manifest, and, lo, the water blushed, and turned to wine.<br> <b>14. </b>The servants took the wine and gave it to the ruler of the feast who called the bridegroom in and said to him,<br> <b>15. </b>This wine is best of all; most people when they give a feast bring in the best wine at first; but, lo, you have reserved the best until last.<br> <b>16. </b>And when the ruler and the guests were told that Jesus, by the power of thought, had turned the water into wine, they were amazed;<br> <b>17. </b>They said, This man is more than man; he surely is the christed one who prophets of the olden times declared would come.<br> <b>18. </b>And many of the guests believed on him, and gladly would have followed him.</p>
