 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 77</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus in Hebron. Goes to Bethany. Advises Ruth regarding certain family troubles.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>With three disciples Jesus went to Hebron where he tarried seven days and taught.<br> <b>2. </b>And then he went to Bethany and in the home of Lazarus he taught.<br> <b>3. </b>The evening came; the multitudes were gone, and Jesus, Lazarus, and his sisters, Martha, Ruth and Mary, were alone.<br> <b>4. </b>And Ruth was sore distressed. Her home was down in Jericho; her husband was the keeper of an inn; his name was Asher-ben.<br> <b>5. </b>Now, Asher was a Pharisee of strictest mien and thought, and he regarded Jesus with disdain.<br> <b>6. </b>And when his wife confessed her faith in Christ, he drove her from his home.<br> <b>7. </b>But Ruth resisted not; she said, If Jesus is the Christ he knows the way, and I am sure He is the Christ.<br> <b>8. </b>My husband may become enraged and slay my human form; he cannot kill the soul, and in the many mansions of my Fatherland I have a dwelling-place.<br> <b>9. </b>And Ruth told Jesus all; and then she said, What shall I do?<br> <b>10. </b>And Jesus said, Your husband is not willingly at fault; he is devout; he prays to God, our Father-God.<br> <b>11. </b>His zeal for his religion is intense; in this he is sincere; but it has driven him insane, and he believes it right to keep his home unsullied by the heresy of Christ.<br> <b>12. </b>He feels assured that he has done the will of God in driving you away.<br> <b>13. </b>Intolerance is ignorance matured.<br> <b>14. </b>The light will come to him some day, and then he will repay for all your heartaches, griefs and tears.<br> <b>15. </b>And Ruth, you must not think that you are free from blame.<br> <b>16. </b>If you had walked in wisdom's ways, and been content to hold your peace, this grief would not have come to you.<br> <b>17. </b>It takes a long, long time for light to break into the shell of prejudice, and patience is the lesson you have need to learn.<br> <b>18. </b>The constant dropping of the water wears away the hardest stone.<br> <b>19. </b>The sweet and holy incense of a godly life will melt intolerance much quicker than the hottest flame, or hardest blow.<br> <b>20. </b>Just wait a little time, and then go home with sympathy and love. Talk not of Christ, nor of the kingdom of the Holy One.<br> <b>21. </b>Just life a godly life; refrain from harshness in your speech, and you will lead your husband to the light.<br> <b>22. </b>And it was so.</p>
