 </i><p>Salome's lessons. The man and the woman. Philosophy of human moods. The triune God. The Septonate. The God Tao.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>Salome taught the lesson of the day. She said, All times are not alike. Today the words of man may have the greatest power; to-morrow women teaches best.<br> <b>2. </b>In all the ways of life the man and woman should walk hand in hand; the one without the other is but half; each has a work to do.<br> <b>3. </b>But all things teach; each has a time and a season for its own. The sun, the moon have lessons of their own for men; but each one teaches at the appointed time.<br> <b>4. </b>The lessons of the sun fall down on human hearts like withered leaves upon a stream, if given in the season of the moon and all the stars.<br> <b>5. </b>To-day one walks in gloom, downhearted and oppressed; tomorrow that same one is filled with joy.<br> <b>6. </b>To-day the heavens seem full of blessedness and hope; tomorrow hope has fled, and every plan and purpose comes to naught.<br> <b>7. </b>To-day one wants to curse the very ground on which he treads; tomorrow he is full of love and praise.<br> <b>8. </b>To-day one hates and scorns and envies and is jealous of the child he loves; tomorrow he has risen above his carnal self, and breathes forth gladness and good-will.<br> <b>9. </b>A thousand times men wonder why these heights and depths, these light hearts and these sad, are found in every life.<br> <b>10. </b>They do not know that there are teachers everywhere, each busy with a God- appointed task, and driving home to human hearts the truth.<br> <b>11. </b>But this is true, and every one receives the lessons that he needs.<br> <b>12. </b>And Mary said, To-day I am in exultation great; my thoughts and all my life seem lifted up; why am I thus inspired?<br> <b>13. </b>Salome replied, This is a day of exultation; day of worship and of praise; a day when, in a measure, we may comprehend our Father-God.<br> <b>14. </b>Then let us study God, the One, the Three, the Seven.<br> <b>15. </b>Before the worlds were formed all things were One; just Spirit, Universal Breath.<br> <b>16. </b>And Spirit breathed, and that which was not manifest became the Fire and Thought of Heaven, the Father-God, the Mother-God.<br> <b>17. </b>And when the Fire and Thought of heaven in union breathed, their son, their only son, was born. This son is Love whom men have called the Christ.<br> <b>18. </b>Men call the Thought of heaven the Holy Breath.<br> <b>19. </b>And when the Triune God breathed forth, lo, seven Spirits stood before the throne. These are Elohim, creative spirits of the universe.<br> <b>20. </b>And these are they who said, Let us make man; and in their image man was made.<br> <b>21. </b>In early ages of the world the dwellers in the farther East said, Tao is the name of Universal Breath; and in the ancient books we read,<br> <b>22. </b>No manifesting form has Tao Great, and yet he made and keeps the heavens and earth.<br> <b>23. </b>No passion has our Tao Great, and yet he causes sun and moon and all the stars to rise and set.<br> <b>24. </b>No name has Tao Great, and yet he makes all things to grow; he brings in season both the seed time and the harvest time.<br> <b>25. </b>And Tao Great was One; the One became the Two; the Two became the Three, the Three evolved the Seven, which filled the universe with manifests.<br> <b>26. </b>And Tao Great gives unto all, the evil and the good, the rain, the dew, the sunshine and the flowers; from his rich stores he feeds them all.<br> <b>27. </b>And in the same old book we read of man: He has a spirit knit to Tao Great; a soul which lives within the seven Breaths of Tao Great; a body of desires that springs up from the soil of flesh.<br> <b>28. </b>Now spirit loves the pure, the good, the true; the body of desires extols the selfish self; the soul becomes the battle ground between the two.<br> <b>29. </b>And blessed is the man whose spirit is triumphant and whose lower self is purified; whose soul is cleansed, becoming fit to be the council chamber of the manifests of Tao Great.<br> <b>30. </b>Thus closed the lesson of Salome.</p>
