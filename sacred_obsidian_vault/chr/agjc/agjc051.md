 <p></p> <h4>Chapter 48</h4> <i>
 </i><p>Jesus receives from the hierophant his mystic name and number. Passes the first brotherhood test, and receives his first degree, SINCERITY.<br> <br> <b>1. </b>The master took down from the wall a scroll on which was written down the number and the name of every attribute and character. He said,<br> <b>2. </b>The circle is the symbol of the perfect man, and seven is the number of the perfect man;<br> <b>3. </b>The Logos is the perfect word; that which creates; that which destroys, and that which saves.<br> <b>4. </b>This Hebrew master is the Logos of the Holy One, the Circle of the human race, the Seven of time.<br> <b>5. </b>And in the record book the scribe wrote down, The Logos-Circle-Seven; and thus was Jesus known.<br> <b>6. </b>The master said, The Logos will give heed to what I say: No man can enter into light till he has found himself. Go forth and search till you have found your soul and then return.<br> <b>7. </b>The guide led Jesus to a room in which the light was faint and mellow, like the light of early dawn.<br> <b>8. </b>The chamber walls were marked with mystic signs, with hieroglyphs and sacred texts; and in this chamber Jesus found himself alone where he remained for many days.<br> <b>9. </b>He read the sacred texts; thought out the meaning of the hieroglyphs and sought the import of the master's charge to find himself.<br> <b>10. </b>A revelation came; he got acquainted with his soul; he found himself; then he was not alone.<br> <b>11. </b>One night he slept and at the midnight hour, a door that he had not observed, was opened, and a priest in sombre garb came in and said,<br> <b>12. </b>My brother, pardon me for coming in at this unseemly hour; but I have come to save your life.<br> <b>13. </b>You are the victim of a cruel plot. The priests of Heliopolis are jealous of your fame, and they have said that you shall never leave these gloomy crypts alive.<br> <b>14. </b>The higher priests do not go forth to teach the world, and you are doomed to temple servitude.<br> <b>15. </b>Now, if you would be free, you must deceive these priests; must tell them you are here to stay for life;<br> <b>16. </b>And then, when you have gained all that you wish to gain, I will return, and by a secret way will lead you forth that you may go in peace.<br> <b>17. </b>And Jesus said, My brother man, would you come here to teach deceit? Am I within these holy walls to learn the wiles of vile hypocrisy?<br> <b>18. </b>Nay, man, my Father scorns deceit, and I am here to do his will.<br> <b>19. </b>Deceive these priests! Not while the sun shall shine. What I have said, that I have said; I will be true to them, to God, and to myself.<br> <b>20. </b>And then the tempter left, and Jesus was again alone; but in a little time a white- robed priest appeared and said,<br> <b>21. </b>Well done! The Logos has prevailed. This is the trial chamber of hypocrisy. And then he led the way, and Jesus stood before the judgement seat.<br> <b>22. </b>And all the brothers stood; the hierophant came forth and laid his hand on Jesus' head, and placed within his hands a scroll, on which was written just one word, SINCERITY; and not a word was said.<br> <b>23.</b> The guide again appeared, and led the way, and in a spacious room replete with everything a student craves was Jesus bade to rest and wait.</p>
