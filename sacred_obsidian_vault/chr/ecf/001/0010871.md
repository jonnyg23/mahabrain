 <p> <a name="ix.vii.xxxiv"></a>  </p><h3 align="center"><a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-p0.1"></a>Chapter XXXIII.—Further proofs of the same proposition, drawn from the promises made by Christ, when He declared that He would drink of the fruit of the vine with His disciples in His Fathers kingdom, while at the same time He promised to reward them an hundred-fold, and to make them partake of banquets. The blessing pronounced by Jacob had pointed out this already, as Papias and the elders have interpreted it.</h3>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-p1"></a>1. For this reason, when about to undergo His sufferings, that He might declare to Abraham and those with him the glad tidings of the inheritance being thrown open, [Christ], after He had given thanks while holding the cup, and had drunk of it, and given it to the disciples, said to them: “Drink ye all of it: this is My blood of the new covenant, which shall be shed for many for the remission of sins. But I say unto you, I will not drink henceforth of the fruit of this vine, until that day when I will drink it new with you in my Fathers kingdom.” <a name="fr_4731"></a><a href="#fn_4731"><font size="1">4732</font></a>
  Thus, then, He will Himself renew the inheritance of the earth, and will re-organize the mystery of the glory of [His] sons; as David says, “He who hath renewed the face of the earth.” <a name="fr_4732"></a><a href="#fn_4732"><font size="1">4733</font></a>
  He promised to drink of the fruit of the vine with His disciples, thus indicating both these points: the inheritance of the earth in which the new fruit of the vine is drunk, and the resurrection of His disciples in the flesh. For the new flesh which rises again is the same which also received the new cup. And He cannot by any means be understood as drinking of the fruit of the vine when settled down with his [disciples] above in a super-celestial place; nor, again, are they who drink it devoid of flesh, for to drink of that which flows from the vine pertains to flesh, and not spirit.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-p4"></a>2. And for this reason the Lord declared, “When thou makest a dinner or a supper, do not call thy friends, nor thy neighbours, nor thy kinsfolk, lest they ask thee in return, and so repay thee. But call the lame, the blind, and the poor, and thou shall be blessed, since they cannot recompense thee, but a recompense shall be made thee at the resurrection of the just.” <a name="fr_4733"></a><a href="#fn_4733"><font size="1">4734</font></a>
  And again He says, “Whosoever shall have left lands, or houses, or parents, or brethren, or children because of Me, he shall receive in this world an hundred-fold, and in that to come he shall inherit eternal life.” <a name="fr_4734"></a><a href="#fn_4734"><font size="1">4735</font></a>
  For what are the hundred-fold [rewards] in this word, the entertainments given to the poor, and the suppers for which a return is made? These are [to take place] in the times of the kingdom, that is, upon the seventh day, which has been sanctified, in which God rested from all the works which He created, which is the true Sabbath of the righteous, which they shall not be engaged in any earthly occupation; but shall have a table at hand prepared for them by God, supplying them with all sorts of dishes.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-p7"></a>3. <a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-p7.1"></a>The blessing of Isaac with which he blessed his younger son Jacob has the same meaning, when he says, “Behold, the smell of my son is as the smell of a full field which the Lord has blessed.” <a name="fr_4735"></a><a href="#fn_4735"><font size="1">4736</font></a>
  But “the field is the world.” <a name="fr_4736"></a><a href="#fn_4736"><font size="1">4737</font></a>
  And therefore he added, “God give to thee of the dew of heaven, and of the fatness of the earth, plenty of corn and wine. And let the nations serve thee, and kings bow down to thee; and be thou lord over thy brother, and thy fathers sons shall bow down to thee: cursed shall be he who shall curse thee, and blessed shall be he who shall bless thee.” <a name="fr_4737"></a><a href="#fn_4737"><font size="1">4738</font></a>
  If any one, then, does not accept these things as referring to the appointed kingdom, he must fall into much contradiction and contrariety, as is the case with the Jews, who are involved in absolute perplexity. For not only did not the nations in this life serve this Jacob; but even after he had received the blessing, he himself going forth [from his home], served his uncle Laban the Syrian for twenty years; <a name="fr_4738"></a><a href="#fn_4738"><font size="1">4739</font></a>
  and not only was he not made lord of his brother, but he did himself bow down before his brother Esau, upon his return from Mesopotamia to his father, and offered many gifts to him. <a name="fr_4739"></a><a href="#fn_4739"><font size="1">4740</font></a>
  Moreover, in what way did he inherit much corn and wine here, he who emigrated to Egypt because of the famine which possessed the land in which he was dwelling, and became subject to Pharaoh, who was then ruling over Egypt? The predicted blessing, therefore, belongs unquestionably to the times of the kingdom, when the righteous shall bear rule upon their rising from the dead; <a name="fr_4740"></a><a href="#fn_4740"><font size="1">4741</font></a>
  when also the creation, having been renovated and set free, shall fructify with an abundance of all kinds of food, from the dew of heaven, and from the fertility of the earth: as the elders who saw John, the disciple of the Lord, related that they had heard  <a name="page_563"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 563</font></a> <a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-Page_563"></a>  from him how the Lord used to teach in regard to these times, and say: The days will come, in which vines shall grow, each having ten thousand branches, and in each branch ten thousand twigs, and in each true <a name="fr_4741"></a><a href="#fn_4741"><font size="1">4742</font></a>
  twig ten thousand shoots, and in each one of the shoots ten thousand clusters, and on every one of the clusters ten thousand grapes, and every grape when pressed will give five and twenty metretes of wine. And when any one of the saints shall lay hold of a cluster, <a name="fr_4742"></a><a href="#fn_4742"><font size="1">4743</font></a>
  another shall cry out, “I am a better cluster, take me; bless the Lord through me.” In like manner [the Lord declared] that a grain of wheat would produce ten thousand ears, and that every ear should have ten thousand grains, and every grain would yield ten pounds (<i>quinque bilibres</i>) of clear, pure, fine flour; and that all other fruit-bearing trees, <a name="fr_4743"></a><a href="#fn_4743"><font size="1">4744</font></a>
  and seeds and grass, would produce in similar proportions (<i>secundum congruentiam iis consequentem</i>); and that all animals feeding [only] on the productions of the earth, should [in those days] become peaceful and harmonious among each other, and be in perfect subjection to man.</p>  
 <p><a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-p17"></a>4. <a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-p17.1"></a>And these things are borne witness to in writing by Papias, the hearer of John, and a companion of Polycarp, in his fourth book; for there were five books compiled (<span class="Greek"><a name="ix.vii.xxxiv-p17.2"></a>συντεταγμένα</span>) by him. <a name="fr_4744"></a><a href="#fn_4744"><font size="1">4745</font></a>
  And he says in addition, “Now these things are credible to believers.” And he says that, “when the traitor Judas did not give credit to them, and put the question, How then can things about to bring forth so abundantly be wrought by the Lord? the Lord declared, They who shall come to these [times] shall see. ” When prophesying of these times, therefore, Esaias says: “The wolf also shall feed with the lamb, and the leopard shall take his rest with the kid; the calf also, and the bull, and the lion shall eat together; and a little boy shall lead them. The ox and the bear shall feed together, and their young ones shall agree together; and the lion shall eat straw as well as the ox. And the infant boy shall thrust his hand into the asps den, into the nest also of the adders brood; and they shall do no harm, nor have power to hurt anything in my holy mountain.” And again he says, in recapitulation, “Wolves and lambs shall then browse together, and the lion shall eat straw like the ox, and the serpent earth as if it were bread; and they shall neither hurt nor annoy anything in my holy mountain, saith the Lord.” <a name="fr_4745"></a><a href="#fn_4745"><font size="1">4746</font></a>
  I am quite aware that some persons endeavour to refer these words to the case of savage men, both of different nations and various habits, who come to believe, and when they have believed, act in harmony with the righteous. But although this is [true] now with regard to some men coming from various nations to the harmony of the faith, nevertheless in the resurrection of the just [the words shall also apply] to those animals mentioned. For God is rich in all things. And it is right that when the creation is restored, all the animals should obey and be in subjection to man, and revert to the food originally given by God (for they had been originally subjected in obedience to Adam), that is, the productions of the earth. But some other occasion, and not the present, is [to be sought] for showing that the lion shall [then] feed on straw. And this indicates the large size and rich quality of the fruits. For if that animal, the lion, feeds upon straw [at that period], of what a quality must the wheat itself be whose straw shall serve as suitable food for lions?</p>
