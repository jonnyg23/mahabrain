 <p> <a name="iii.ii.i.xix"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p0.1"></a>Chap. xviii.—on the consecration of gods, on account of the benefits which they conferred upon men.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p1"></a>In this place also they are to be refuted, who not only admit that gods have been made from men, but even boast of it as a subject of praise, either on account of their valour, as <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p1.1"></a>Hercules, or of their gifts, as <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p1.2"></a>Ceres and <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p1.3"></a>Liber, or of the arts which they discovered, as <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p1.4"></a>Æsculapius or <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p1.5"></a>Minerva. But how foolish these things are, and how unworthy of being the causes why men should contaminate themselves with inexpiable guilt, and become enemies to God, in contempt of whom they undertake offerings to the dead, I will show from particular instances. They say that it is virtue <a name="fr_80"></a><a href="#fn_80"><font size="1">81</font></a>
  which exalts man to heaven,—not, however, that concerning which philosophers discuss, which consists in goods of the soul, but this connected with the body, which is called fortitude; and since this was pre-eminent in <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p2.2"></a>Hercules, it is believed to have deserved immortality. Who is so foolishly senseless as to judge strength of body to be a divine or even a human good, when it has been assigned in greater measure to cattle, and it is often impaired by one disease, or is lessened by old age <a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-Page_31"></a>itself, and altogether fails? And so <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p2.3"></a>Hercules, when he perceived that his muscles were disfigured by ulcers, neither wished to be healed nor to grow old, that he might not at any time appear to have less strength or comeliness than he once had. <a name="fr_81"></a><a href="#fn_81"><font size="1">82</font></a>
  They supposed that he ascended into heaven from the funeral pile on which he had burnt himself alive; and those very qualities which they most foolishly admired, they expressed by statues and images, and consecrated, so that they might for ever remain as memorials of the folly of those who had believed that gods owed their origin to the slaughter of beasts. But this, perchance, may be the fault of the Greeks, who always esteemed most trifling things as of the greatest consequence. What is the case of our own countrymen? Are they more wise? For they despise valour in an athlete, because it produces no injury; but in the case of a king, because it occasions widely-spread disasters, they so admire it as to imagine that brave and warlike generals are admitted to the assembly of the gods, and that there is no other way to immortality than to lead armies, to lay waste the territory of others, to destroy cities, to overthrow towns, to put to death or enslave free peoples. Truly the greater number of men they have cast down, plundered, and slain, so much the more noble and distinguished do they think themselves; and ensnared by the show of empty glory, they give to their crimes the name of virtue. I would rather that they should make to themselves gods from the slaughter of wild beasts, than approve of an immortality so stained with blood. If any one has slain a single man, he is regarded as contaminated and wicked, nor do they think it lawful for him to be admitted to this earthly abode of the gods. But he who has slaughtered countless thousands of men, has inundated plains with blood, and infected rivers, is not only admitted into the temple, but even into heaven. In Ennius <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p3.1"></a>Africanus thus speaks: “If it is permitted any one to ascend to the regions of the gods above, the greatest gate of heaven is open to me alone.” Because, in truth, he extinguished and destroyed a great part of the human race. Oh how great the darkness in which you were involved, O Africanus, or rather O poet, in that you imagined the ascent to heaven to be open to men through slaughters and bloodshed! And <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p3.2"></a>Cicero also assented to this delusion. It is so in truth, he said, O Africanus, for the same gate was open to <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p3.3"></a>Hercules; as though he himself had been doorkeeper in heaven at the time when this took place. I indeed cannot determine whether I should think it a subject of grief or of ridicule, when I see grave and learned, and, as they appear to themselves, wise men, involved in such miserable waves of errors. If this is the virtue which renders us immortal, I for my part should prefer to die, rather than to be the cause of destruction to as many as possible. If immortality can be obtained in no other way than by bloodshed, what will be the result if all shall agree to <span><a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p3.4"></a>live in</span> harmony? And this may undoubtedly be realized, if men would cast aside their pernicious and impious madness, and live in innocence and justice. Shall no one, then, be worthy of heaven? Shall virtue perish, because it will not be permitted men to rage against their fellow-men? But they who reckon the overthrow of cities and people as the greatest glory will not endure public tranquillity: they will plunder and rage; and by the infliction of outrageous injuries will disturb the compact of human society, that they may have an enemy whom they may destroy with greater wickedness than that with which they attacked.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p4"></a>Now let us proceed to the remaining subjects. The conferring of benefits gave the name of gods to <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p4.1"></a>Ceres and <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p4.2"></a>Liber. I am able to prove from the sacred writings that wine and corn were used by men before the offspring of <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p4.3"></a>Cœlus and <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p4.4"></a>Saturnus. But let us suppose that they were introduced by these. Can it appear to be a greater thing to have collected corn, and having bruised it, to have taught men to make bread; or to have pressed grapes gathered from the vine, and to have made wine, than to have produced and brought forth from the earth corn itself, or the vine? God, indeed, may have left these things to be drawn out by the ingenuity of man; yet all things must belong to Him, who gave to man both wisdom to discover, and those very things which might be discovered. The arts also are said to have gained immortality for their inventors, as medicine for <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p4.5"></a>Æsculapius, the craft of the smith for <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p4.6"></a>Vulcan. Therefore let us worship those also who taught the art of the fuller and of the shoemaker. But why is not honour paid to the discoverer of the potters art? Is it that those rich men despise Samian vessels? There are also other arts, the inventors of which greatly profited the life of man. Why have not temples been assigned to them also? But doubtless it is <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p4.7"></a>Minerva who discovered all, and therefore workmen offer prayers to her. Such, then, was the low condition <a name="fr_82"></a><a href="#fn_82"><font size="1">83</font></a>
  from which <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-p5.1"></a>Minerva ascended to heaven. Is there truly any reason why any one should leave the worship of Him who created <a name="fr_83"></a><a href="#fn_83"><font size="1">84</font></a>
  the earth with its living creatures, and the heaven with its stars, for the adoration of her who taught men to set up the woof? What place does he hold who taught the healing of wounds in the <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.i.xix-Page_32"></a>body? Can he be more excellent than Him who formed the body itself, and the power of sensibility and of life? Finally, did he contrive and bring to light the herbs themselves, and the other things in which the healing art consists?  </p>
