 <p> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p0.1"></a>Chap. XV.—The Error of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p0.2"></a>Seneca in Philosophy, and How the Speech of Philosophers is at Variance with Their Life.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p1"></a>Under the influence of the same error (for who could keep the right course when <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p1.1"></a>Cicero is in error?), <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p1.2"></a>Seneca said: “Philosophy is nothing else than the right method of living, or the science of living honourably, or the art of passing a good life. We shall not err in saying that philosophy is the law of living well and honourably. And he who spoke of it as a rule of life, gave to it that which was its due.” He evidently did not refer to the common name of philosophy; for, since this is diffused into many sects and systems, and has nothing certain—nothing, in short, respecting which all agree with one mind and one voice,—what can be so false as that philosophy should be called the rule of life, since the diversity of its precepts hinders the right way and causes confusion? or the law of living well, when its subjects are widely discordant? or the science of passing life, in which nothing else is effected by its repeated contradictions than general <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">421</font></a>
  uncertainty? For I ask whether he thinks that the Academy is philosophy or not? I do not think that he will deny it. And if this is so, none of these things, therefore, is in agreement with philosophy; which renders all things uncertain, abrogates law, esteems art as nothing, subverts method, distorts rule, entirely takes away knowledge. Therefore all those things are false, because they are inconsistent with a system which is always uncertain, and up to this time explaining nothing. Therefore no system, or science, or law of living well, has been established, except in this the only true and heavenly wisdom, which had been unknown to philosophers. For that earthly wisdom, since it is false, becomes varied and manifold, and altogether opposed to itself. And as there is but one founder and ruler of the world, God, and as truth is one; so wisdom must be one and simple, because, if anything is true and good, it cannot be perfect unless it is the only one of its kind. But if philosophy were able to form the life, no others but philosophers would be good, and all those who had not learned it would be always bad. But since there are, and always have been, innumerable persons who are or have been good without any learning, but of philosophers there has seldom been one who has done anything praiseworthy in his life; who is there, I pray, who does not see that those men are not teachers <a name="page_84"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-Page_84"></a>of virtue, of which they themselves are destitute? For if any one should diligently inquire into their character, he will find that they are passionate, covetous, lustful, arrogant, wanton, and, concealing their vices under a show of wisdom, doing those things at home which they had censured in the schools. <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">422</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p4"></a>Perhaps I speak falsely for the sake of bringing an accusation. Does not <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p4.1"></a>Tullius both acknowledge and complain of the same thing? “How few,” he says, “of philosophers are found of such a character, so constituted in soul and life, as reason demands! how few who think true instruction not a display of knowledge, but a law of life! how few who are obedient to themselves, and submit to their own decrees! We may see some of such levity and ostentation, that it would be better for them not to have learned at all; others eagerly desirous of money, others of glory; many the slaves of lusts, so that their speech wonderfully disagrees with their life.” <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p4.2"></a>Cornelius Nepos also writes to the same <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p4.3"></a>Cicero: “So far am I from thinking that philosophy is the teacher of life and the completer of happiness, that I consider that none have greater need of teachers of living than many who are engaged in the discussion of this subject. For I see that a great part of those who give most elaborate precepts in their school respect-modesty and self-restraint, live at the same time in the unrestrained desires of all lusts.” <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p4.4"></a>Seneca also, in his <span><a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p4.5"></a>Exhortations</span>, says: “Many of the philosophers are of this description, eloquent to their own condemnation: for if you should hear them arguing against avarice, against lust and ambition, you would think that they were making a public disclosure <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">423</font></a>
  of their own character, so entirely do the censures which they utter in public flow back upon themselves; so that it is right to regard them in no other light than as physicians, whose advertisements <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_423"><font size="1">424</font></a>
  contain medicines, but their medicine chests poison. Some are not ashamed of their vices; but they invent defences for their baseness, so that they may appear even to sin with honour.” <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p6.2"></a>Seneca also says: “The wise man will even do things which he will not approve of, that he may find means of passing to the accomplishment of greater things; nor will he abandon good morals, but will adapt them to the occasion; and those things which others employ for glory or pleasure, he will employ for the sake of action.” Then he says shortly afterwards: “All things which the luxurious and the ignorant do, the wise man also will do, but not in the same manner, and with the same purpose. But it makes no difference with what intention you act, when the action itself is vicious; because acts are seen, the intention is not seen.”  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p7"></a><a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p7.1"></a>Aristippus, the master of the Cyrenaics, had a criminal intimacy with <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p7.2"></a>Lais, the celebrated courtesan; and that grave teacher of philosophy defended this fault by saying, that there was a great difference between him and the other lovers of <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p7.3"></a>Lais, because he himself possessed <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p7.4"></a>Lais, whereas others were possessed by <a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p7.5"></a>Lais. O illustrious wisdom, to be imitated by good men! Would you, in truth, entrust your children to this man for education, that they might learn to possess a harlot? He said that there was some difference between himself and the dissolute, that they wasted their property, whereas he lived in indulgence without any cost. And in this the harlot was plainly the wiser, who had the philosopher as her creature, that all the youth, corrupted by the example and authority of the teacher, might flock together to her without any shame. What difference therefore did it make, with what intention the philosopher betook himself to that most notorious harlot, when the people and his rivals saw him more depraved than all the abandoned? Nor was it enough to live in this manner, but he began also to teach lusts; and he transferred his habits from the brothel to the school, contending that bodily pleasure was the chief good. Which pernicious and shameful doctrine has its origin not in the heart of the philosopher, but in the bosom of the harlot.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.iii.xv-p8"></a>For why should I speak of the Cynics, who practised licentiousness in public? What wonder if they derived their name and title from dogs, <a name="fr_424"></a><a href="#fn_424"><font size="1">425</font></a>
  since they also imitated their life? Therefore there is no instruction of virtue in this sect, since even those who enjoin more honourable things either themselves do not practice what they advise; or if they do (which rarely happens), it is not the system which leads them to that which is right, but nature which often impels even the unlearned to praise.  </p>
