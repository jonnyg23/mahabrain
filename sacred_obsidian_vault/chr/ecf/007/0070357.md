 <p> <a name="iii.v.xlviii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.v.xlviii-p0.1"></a>Chap. XLVIII.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xlviii-p1"></a>Not many days after the victory, <a name="iii.v.xlviii-p1.1"></a>Licinius, having received part of the soldiers of <a name="iii.v.xlviii-p1.2"></a>Daia into his service, and properly distributed them, transported his army into Bithynia, and having made his entry into Nicomedia, he returned thanks to God, through whose aid he had overcome; and on the ides of June, <a name="fr_1995"></a><a href="#fn_1995"><font size="1">1996</font></a>
  while he and <a name="iii.v.xlviii-p2.2"></a>Constantine were consuls for the third time, he commanded the following edict for the restoration of the Church, directed to the president of the province, to be promulgated:—  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xlviii-p3"></a>“When we, <a name="iii.v.xlviii-p3.1"></a>Constantine and <a name="iii.v.xlviii-p3.2"></a>Licinius, emperors, had an interview at Milan, and conferred together with respect to the good and security of the commonweal, it seemed to us that, amongst those things that are profitable to mankind in general, the reverence paid to the Divinity merited our first and chief attention, and that it was proper that the Christians and all others should have liberty to follow that mode of religion which to each of them appeared best; so that that God, who is seated in heaven, might be benign and propitious to us, and to every one under our government. And therefore we judged it a salutary measure, and one highly consonant to right reason, that no man should be denied leave of attaching himself to the rites of the Christians, or to whatever other religion his mind directed him, that thus the supreme Divinity, to whose worship we freely devote ourselves, might continue to vouchsafe His favour and beneficence to us. And accordingly we give you to know that, without regard to any provisos in our former orders to you concerning the Christians, all who choose that religion are to be permitted, freely and absolutely, to remain in it, and not to be disturbed any ways, or molested. And we thought fit to be thus special in the things committed to your charge, that you might understand that the indulgence which we have granted in matters of religion to the Christians is ample and unconditional; and perceive at the same time that the open and free exercise of their respective religions is granted to all others, as well as to the Christians. For it befits the well-ordered state and the tranquillity of our times that each individual be allowed, according to his own choice, to worship the Divinity; and we mean not to derogate aught from the honour due to any religion or its votaries. Moreover, with respect to the Christians, we formerly gave certain orders concerning the places appropriated for their religious assemblies; but now we will that all persons who have purchased such places, either from our exchequer or from any one else, do restore them to the Christians, without money demanded or price claimed, and that this be performed peremptorily and unambiguously; and we will also, that they who have obtained any right to such places by form of gift do forthwith restore them to the Christians: reserving always to such persons, who have either purchased for a price, or gratuitously acquired them, to make application to the judge of the district, if they look on themselves as entitled to any equivalent from our beneficence.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xlviii-p4"></a>“All those places are, by your intervention, to be immediately restored to the Christians. And because it appears that, besides the places appropriated to religious worship, the Christians did possess other places, which belonged not to individuals, but to their society in general, that is, to their churches, we comprehend all such within the regulation aforesaid, and we will that you cause them all to be restored to the society or churches, and <span><a name="iii.v.xlviii-p4.1"></a>that</span> without hesitation or controversy: Provided always, that the persons making restitution without a price paid shall be at liberty to seek indemnification from our bounty. In furthering all which things for the behoof of the Christians, you are to use your utmost diligence, to the end that our orders be speedily obeyed, and our gracious purpose in securing the public tranquillity promoted. So shall that divine favour which, in affairs of the mightiest importance, we have already experienced, continue to give success to us, and in our successes make the commonweal happy. And that the tenor of this our gracious ordinance may be made known unto all, we will that you cause it by your authority to be published everywhere.”  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xlviii-p5"></a><a name="iii.v.xlviii-p5.1"></a>Licinius having issued this ordinance, made an harangue, in which he exhorted the Christians to rebuild their religious edifices.   </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.v.xlviii-p6"></a>And thus, from the overthrow of the Church <a name="page_321"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 321</font></a> <a name="iii.v.xlviii-Page_321"></a>until its restoration, there was a space of ten years and about four months.  </p>
