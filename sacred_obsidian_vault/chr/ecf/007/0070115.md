 <p> <a name="iii.ii.v.ii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p0.1"></a>Chap. II.—To What an Extent the Christian Truth Has Been Assailed by Rash Men.</h4>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p1"></a>Therefore, because there have been wanting among us suitable and skilful teachers, who might vigorously and sharply refute public errors, and who might defend the whole cause of truth with elegance and copiousness, this very want incited some to venture to write against the truth, which was unknown to them. I pass by those who in former times in vain assailed it. When I was teaching rhetorical learning in Bithynia, having been called thither, and it had happened that at the same time the temple of God was overthrown, there were living at the same place two men who insulted the truth as it lay prostrate and overthrown, I know not whether with greater arrogance or harshness: the one of whom professed himself the high priest of philosophy; <a name="fr_926"></a><a href="#fn_926"><font size="1">927</font></a>
  but he was so addicted to vice, that, though a teacher of abstinence, he was not less inflamed with avarice than with lusts; so extravagant in his manner of living, that though in his school he was the maintainer of virtue, the praiser of parsimony and poverty, he dined less sumptuously in a palace than at his own house. Nevertheless he sheltered <a name="fr_927"></a><a href="#fn_927"><font size="1">928</font></a>
  his vices by his hair <a name="fr_928"></a><a href="#fn_928"><font size="1">929</font></a>
  and his cloak, and (that which is the greatest screen <a name="fr_929"></a><a href="#fn_929"><font size="1">930</font></a>
 ) by his riches; and that he might increase these, he used to penetrate with wonderful effort <a name="fr_930"></a><a href="#fn_930"><font size="1">931</font></a>
  to the friendships of the judges; and he suddenly attached them to himself by the authority of a fictitious name, not only that he might make a traffic of their decisions, but also that he might by this influence hinder his neighbours, whom he was driving from their homes and lands, from the recovery of their property. This man, in truth, who overthrew his own arguments by his character, or censured his own character by his arguments, a weighty censor and most keen accuser against himself, at the very same time in which a righteous people were impiously assailed, vomited forth three books against the Christian religion and name; professing, above all things, that it was the office of a philosopher to remedy the errors of men, and to recall them to the true way, that is, to the worship of the gods, by whose power and majesty, as he said, the world is governed; and not to permit that inexperienced men should be enticed by the frauds of any, lest their simplicity should be a prey and sustenance to crafty men.  </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p7"></a>Therefore he said that he had undertaken this office, worthy of philosophy, that he might hold out to those who do not see the light of wisdom, not only that they may return to a healthy state of mind, having undertaken the worship of the gods, but also that, having laid aside their pertinacious obstinacy, they may avoid tortures of the body, nor wish in vain to endure cruel lacerations of their limbs. But that it might be evident on what account he had laboriously worked out that task, he broke out profusely into praises of the princes, whose piety and foresight, as he himself indeed said, had been distinguished both in other matters, and especially in defending the religious rites of the gods; that he had, in short, consulted the interests of men, in order that, impious and foolish superstition having been restrained, all men might have leisure for lawful sacred rites, and might experience the gods propitious to them. But when he wished to weaken the grounds of that religion against which he was pleading, he appeared senseless, vain, and ridiculous; because that weighty adviser of the advantage of others was ignorant not only what to oppose, but even what to speak. For if any of our religion were present, although they were silent on account of the time, nevertheless in their mind they derided him; since they saw a man professing that he would enlighten others, when he himself was blind; that he would recall others from error, when he himself was ignorant where to plant his feet; that he would instruct others to the truth, of which he himself had never seen even a spark at any time; inasmuch as he who was a professor of wisdom, endeavoured to overthrow wisdom. All, however, censured this, that he undertook this work at that time in particular, in which odious cruelty raged. O philosopher, a flatterer, and a time-server! But this man was despised, as his vanity deserved; for he did not gain the popularity which he hoped for, and the glory which he eagerly sought for was changed into censure and blame. <a name="fr_931"></a><a href="#fn_931"><font size="1">932</font></a>
    </p>  
 <p class="BodyText"><a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p9"></a>Another <a name="fr_932"></a><a href="#fn_932"><font size="1">933</font></a>
  wrote the same subject with more bitterness, who was then of the number of the judges, and who was especially the adviser of enacting persecution; and not contented with this crime, he also pursued with writings those whom he had persecuted. For he composed <a name="page_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a> <a name="iii.ii.v.ii-Page_138"></a>two books, not <span><a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p10.5"></a>against</span> the Christians, lest he might appear to assail them in a hostile manner but <span><a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p10.6"></a>to</span> the Christians, that he might be thought to consult for them with humanity and kindness. And in these writings he endeavoured so to prove the falsehood of sacred Scripture, as though it were altogether contradictory to itself; for he expounded some chapters which seemed to be at variance with themselves, enumerating so many and such secret <a name="fr_933"></a><a href="#fn_933"><font size="1">934</font></a>
  things, that he sometimes appears to have been one of the same sect. But if this was so, what <a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p11.2"></a>Demosthenes will be able to defend from the charge of impiety him who became the betrayer of the religion to which he had given his assent, <a name="fr_934"></a><a href="#fn_934"><font size="1">935</font></a>
  and of the faith the name of which he had assumed, <a name="fr_935"></a><a href="#fn_935"><font size="1">936</font></a>
  and of the mystery <a name="fr_936"></a><a href="#fn_936"><font size="1">937</font></a>
  which he had received, unless it happened by chance that the sacred writings fell into his hands? What rashness was it, therefore, to dare to destroy that which no one explained to him! It was well that he either learned nothing or understood nothing. For contradiction is as far removed from the sacred writings as he was removed from faith and truth. He chiefly, however, assailed <a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p14.2"></a>Paul and <a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p14.3"></a>Peter, and the other disciples, as disseminators of deceit, whom at the same time he testified to have been unskilled and unlearned. For he says that some of them made gain by the craft of fishermen, as though he took it ill that some <a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p14.4"></a>Aristophanes or <a name="iii.ii.v.ii-p14.5"></a>Aristarchus did not devise that subject.  </p>
