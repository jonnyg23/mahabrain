 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.viii.x-p2"></a>“But when you have been regenerated by water, show by good works the likeness in you of that Father who hath begotten you.  Now you know God, honour Him as a father; and His honour is, that you live according to His will.  And His will is, that you so live as to know nothing of murder or adultery, to flee from hatred and covetousness, to put away anger, pride, and boasting, to abhor envy, and to count all such things entirely unsuitable to you.  There is truly a certain peculiar observance of our religion, which is not so much imposed upon men, as it is sought out by every worshipper of God by reason of its purity.  By reason of chastity, I say, of which there are many kinds, but first, that every one be careful that he come not near a menstruous woman; for this the law of God regards as detestable.  But though the law had given no admonition concerning these things, should we willingly, like beetles, roll ourselves in filth?  For we ought to have something more than the animals, as reasonable men, and capable of heavenly senses, whose chief study it ought to be to guard the conscience from every defilement of the heart.</p>
