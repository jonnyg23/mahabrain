 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.xii.vi-p2"></a>“But I should like that one of you, and not Peter, should answer what I have said; for it is not fitting to take words and instruction at his hand, with questions; but when he gives a deliverance on any subject, that should be held without answering again.  And therefore let us keep him as an umpire; so that if at any time our discussion does not come to an issue, he may declare what seems good to him, and so give an undoubted end to doubtful matters.  And now therefore I could believe, content with his sole opinion, if he expressed any opinion; and this is what I shall do at last.  Yet I wish first to see if it is possible by discussion to find what is sought.  My wish therefore is, that Clement should begin first, and should show if there is any good or evil in substance or in actions.”</p>
