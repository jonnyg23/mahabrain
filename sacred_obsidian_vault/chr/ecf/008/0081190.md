 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.v.xiii-p2"></a>After these things there arose a great report that Mary was with child.  And Joseph was seized by the officers of the temple, and brought along with Mary to the high priest.  And he with the priests began to reproach him, and to say:  Why hast thou beguiled so great and so glorious a virgin, who was fed like a dove in the temple by the angels of God, who never wished either to see or to have a man, who had the most excellent knowledge of the law of God?  If thou hadst not done violence to her, she would still have remained in her virginity.  And Joseph vowed, and swore that he had never touched her at all.  And Abiathar the high priest answered him:  As the Lord liveth, I will give thee to drink of the water of drinking of the Lord, and immediately thy sin will appear.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xiii-p3"></a>Then was assembled a multitude of people which could not be numbered, and Mary was brought to the temple.  And the priests, and her relatives, and her parents wept, and said to Mary:  Confess to the priests thy sin, thou that wast like a dove in the temple of God, and didst receive food from the hands of an angel.  And again Joseph was summoned to the altar, and the water of drinking of the Lord was given him to drink.  And when any one that had lied drank this water, and walked seven times round the altar, God used to show some sign in his face.  When, therefore, Joseph had drunk in safety, and had walked round the altar seven times, no sign of sin appeared in him.  Then all the priests, and the officers, and the people justified him, saying:  Blessed art thou, seeing that no charge has been found good against thee.  And they summoned Mary, and said:  And what excuse canst thou have? or what greater sign can appear in thee than the conception of thy womb, which betrays thee?  This only we require of thee, that since Joseph is pure <a name="page_374"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 374</font></a> <a name="vii.v.xiii-Page_374"></a>regarding thee, thou confess who it is that has beguiled thee.  For it is better that thy confession should betray thee, than that the wrath of God should set a mark on thy face, and expose thee in the midst of the people.  Then Mary said, stedfastly and without trembling:  O Lord God, King over all, who knowest all secrets, if there be any pollution in me, or any sin, or any evil desires, or unchastity, expose me in the sight of all the people, and make me an example of punishment to all.  Thus saying, she went up to the altar of the Lord boldly, and drank the water of drinking, and walked round the altar seven times, and no spot was found in her.</p> 
 <p class="c22"><a name="vii.v.xiii-p4"></a>And when all the people were in the utmost astonishment, seeing that she was with child, and that no sign had appeared in her face, they began to be disturbed among themselves by conflicting statements:  some said that she was holy and unspotted, others that she was wicked and defiled.  Then Mary, seeing that she was still suspected by the people, and that on that account she did not seem to them to be wholly cleared, said in the hearing of all, with a loud voice, As the Lord Adonai liveth, the Lord of Hosts before whom I stand, I have not known man; but I am known by Him to whom from my earliest years I have devoted myself.  And this vow I made to my God from my infancy, that I should remain unspotted in Him who created me, and I trust that I shall so live to Him alone, and serve Him alone; and in Him, as long as I shall live, will I remain unpolluted.  Then they all began to kiss her feet and to embrace her knees, asking her to pardon them for their wicked suspicions.  And she was led down to her house with exultation and joy by the people, and the priests, and all the virgins.  And they cried out, and said:  Blessed be the name of the Lord for ever, because He hath manifested thy holiness to all His people Israel.</p>
