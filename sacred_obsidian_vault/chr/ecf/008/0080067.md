 <p class="c21"><a name="vi.iii.iii.v-p2"></a>What, then, shall I do?  This shall I do.  I shall proceed to Egypt, and there I shall cultivate the friendship of the hierophants or prophets, who preside at the shrines.  Then I shall win over a magician by money, and entreat him, by what they call the necromantic art, to bring me a soul from the infernal regions, as if I were desirous of consulting it about some business.  But this shall be my consultation, whether the soul be immortal.  Now, the proof that the soul is immortal will be put past doubt, not from what it says, or from what I hear, but from what I see:  for seeing it with my eyes, I shall ever after hold the surest conviction of its immortality; and no fallacy of words or uncertainty of hearing shall ever be able to disturb the persuasion produced by sight.  However, I related this project to a certain philosopher with whom I was intimate, who counselled me not to venture upon it; “for,” said he, “if the soul should not obey the call of the magician, you henceforth will live more hopelessly, as thinking that there is nothing after death, and also as having tried things unlawful.  If, however, you seem to see anything, what religion or what piety can arise to you from things unlawful and impious?  For they say that transactions of this sort are hateful to the Divinity, and that God sets Himself in opposition to those who trouble souls after their release from the body.”  When I heard this, I was indeed staggered in my purpose; yet I could not in any way either lay aside my longing, or cast off the distressing thought.</p>
