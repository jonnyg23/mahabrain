 <p class="c21"><a name="vii.xvi.x-p2"></a>And while the saints Enoch and Elias were thus speaking, behold, there came up another man, most wretched, carrying on his shoulders the sign of the cross.  And seeing him, all the saints said to him:  Who art thou? because thy appearance is that of a robber.  And what is the sign which thou carriest on thy shoulders?  In answer to them, he said:  Truly have you said that I was a robber, doing all sorts of evil upon the earth.  And the Jews crucified me along with Jesus; and I saw the miracles in created things which were done through the cross of Jesus crucified, and I believed Him to be the Creator of all created things, and the King omnipotent; and I entreated Him, saying, Be mindful of me, Lord, when Thou shalt have come into Thy kingdom.  Immediately He accepted my entreaty, and said to me, Amen; I say to thee, To-day shalt thou be with me in paradise. <a name="fr_1995"></a><a href="#fn_1995"><font size="1">1996</font></a>
   And He gave me this sign of the cross, saying, Walk into paradise carrying this; and if the guardian angel of paradise will not let thee go in, show him the sign of the cross, and thou shalt say to him, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who has now been crucified, has sent me.  Having done so, I said all this to the guardian angel of paradise.  And when he heard this, he immediately opened, and led me in, and placed me at the right of paradise, saying, Lo, hold a little, and there will come in the father of the whole human race, Adam, with all his children, holy and just, after the triumph and glory of the ascension of Christ the crucified Lord.  Hearing all these words of the robber, all the holy patriarchs and prophets with one voice said:  Blessed art Thou, O Lord Almighty, Father of everlasting benefits, and Father of mercies, who hast given such grace to Thy sinners, and hast brought them back into the grace of paradise, and into Thy rich pastures; for this is spiritual life most sure.  Amen, amen.</p>
