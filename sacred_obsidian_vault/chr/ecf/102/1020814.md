 </p><p class="c34"><a name="v.vi.xxxiv-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="v.vi.xxxiv-p1.1"></a>Chapter 34.—The Fourth Rule of Tichonius.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="v.vi.xxxiv-p2"></a>47.  The fourth rule of Tichonius is about <i>species and genus</i>.  For so he calls it, intending that by species should be understood a part, by genus the whole of which that which he calls species is a part:  as, for example, every single city is a part of the great society of nations:  the city he calls a species, all  <a name="page_570"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 570</font></a> <a name="v.vi.xxxiv-Page_570"></a>  nations constitute the genus.  There is no necessity for here applying that subtilty of distinction which is in use among logicians, who discuss with great acuteness the difference between a part and a species.  The rule is of course the same, if anything of the kind referred to is found in Scripture, not in regard to a single city, but in regard to a single province, or tribe, or kingdom.  Not only, for example, about Jerusalem, or some of the cities of the Gentiles, such as Tyre or Babylon, are things said in Scripture whose significance oversteps the limits of the city, and which are more suitable when applied to all nations; but in regard to Judea also, and Egypt, and Assyria, or any other nation you choose to take which contains numerous cities, but still is not the whole world, but only a part of it, things are said which pass over the limits of that particular country, and apply more fitly to the whole of which this is a part; or, as our author terms it, to the genus of which this is a species.  And hence these words have come to be commonly known, so that even uneducated people understand what is laid down specially, and what generally, in any given Imperial command.  The same thing occurs in the case of men:  things are said of Solomon, for example, the scope of which reaches far beyond him, and which are only properly understood when applied to Christ and His Church, of which Solomon is a part. <a name="fr_1908"></a><a href="#fn_1908"><font size="1">1909</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="v.vi.xxxiv-p4"></a>48.  Now the species is not always overstepped, for things are often said of such a kind as evidently apply to it also, or perhaps even to it exclusively.  But when Scripture, having up to a certain point been speaking about the species, makes a transition at that point from the species to the genus, the reader must then be carefully on his guard against seeking in the species what he can find much better and more surely in the genus.  Take, for example, what the prophet Ezekiel says:  “When the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it by their own way, and by their doings:  their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.  Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had polluted it:  and I scattered them among the heathen, and they were dispersed through the countries:  according to their way, and according to their doings, I judged them.” <a name="fr_1909"></a><a href="#fn_1909"><font size="1">1910</font></a>
   Now it is easy to understand that this applies to that house of Israel of which the apostle says, “Behold Israel after the flesh;” <a name="fr_1910"></a><a href="#fn_1910"><font size="1">1911</font></a>
  because the people of Israel after the flesh did both perform and endure all that is here referred to.  What immediately follows, too, may be understood as applying to the same people.  But when the prophet begins to say, “And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord,” <a name="fr_1911"></a><a href="#fn_1911"><font size="1">1912</font></a>
  the reader ought now carefully to observe the way in which the species is overstepped and the genus taken in.  For he goes on to say:  “And I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.  For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.  Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be clean:  from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will I cleanse you.  A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh.  And I will put my Spirit within you, and cause you to walk in my statutes, and ye shall keep my commandments, and do them.  And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers; and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.  I will also save you from all your uncleannesses.” <a name="fr_1912"></a><a href="#fn_1912"><font size="1">1913</font></a>
   Now that this is a prophecy of the New Testament, to which pertain not only the remnant of that one nation of which it is elsewhere said, “For though the number of the children of Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a remnant of them shall be saved,” <a name="fr_1913"></a><a href="#fn_1913"><font size="1">1914</font></a>
  but also the other nations which were promised to their fathers and our fathers; and that there is here a promise of that washing of regeneration which, as we see, is now imparted to all nations, no one who looks into the matter can doubt.  And that saying of the apostle, when he is commending the grace of the New Testament and its excellence in comparison with the Old, “Ye are our epistle . . . written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart,” <a name="fr_1914"></a><a href="#fn_1914"><font size="1">1915</font></a>
  has an evident reference to this place where the prophet says, “A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you; and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.” <a name="fr_1915"></a><a href="#fn_1915"><font size="1">1916</font></a>
   Now the heart of flesh from which the apostles expression, “the fleshy tables of the heart,” is drawn, the prophet intended to point out as distinguished from the stony heart by the possession of sentient life; and by sentient  <a name="page_571"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 571</font></a> <a name="v.vi.xxxiv-Page_571"></a>  he understood intelligent life.  And thus the spiritual Israel is made up, not of one nation, but of all the nations which were promised to the fathers in their seed, that is, in Christ.</p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="v.vi.xxxiv-p12"></a>49.  This spiritual Israel, therefore, is distinguished from the carnal Israel which is of one nation, by newness of grace, not by nobility of descent, in feeling, not in race; but the prophet, in his depth of meaning, while speaking of the carnal Israel, passes on, without indicating the transition, to speak of the spiritual, and although now speaking of the latter, seems to be still speaking of the former; not that he grudges us the clear apprehension of Scripture, as if we were enemies, but that he deals with us as a physician, giving us a wholesome exercise for our spirit.  And therefore we ought to take this saying, “And I will bring you into your own land,” and what he says shortly afterwards, as if repeating himself, “And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers,” not literally, as if they referred to Israel after the flesh, but spiritually, as referring to the spiritual Israel.  For the Church, without spot or wrinkle, gathered out of all nations, and destined to reign for ever with Christ, is itself the land of the blessed, the land of the living; and we are to understand that this was given to the fathers when it was promised to them for what the fathers believed would be given in its own time was to them, on account of the unchangeableness of the promise and purpose, the same as if it were already given; just as the apostle, writing to Timothy, speaks of the grace which is given to the saints:  “Not according to our works, but according to His own purpose and grace, which was given us in Christ Jesus before the world began; but is now made manifest by the appearing of our Saviour.” <a name="fr_1916"></a><a href="#fn_1916"><font size="1">1917</font></a>
   He speaks of the grace as given at a time when those to whom it was to be given were not yet in existence; because he looks upon that as having been already done in the arrangement and purpose of God, which was to take place in its own time, and he himself speaks of it as now made manifest.  It is possible, however, that these words may refer to the land of the age to come, when there will be a new heaven and a new earth, wherein the unrighteous shall be unable to dwell.  And so it is truly said to the righteous, that the land itself is theirs, no part of which will belong to the unrighteous; because it is the same as if it were itself given, when it is firmly settled that it shall be given.</p>
