 </p><p class="c34"><a name="iv.XI.13-p1"></a><span class="c2"><a name="iv.XI.13-p1.1"></a>Chapter 13.—Whether All the Angels Were So Created in One Common State of Felicity, that Those Who Fell Were Not Aware that They Would Fall, and that Those Who Stood Received Assurance of Their Own Perseverance After the Ruin of the Fallen.</span></p>  
 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.XI.13-p2"></a>From all this, it will readily occur to any one that the blessedness which an intelligent being desires as its legitimate object results from a combination of these two things, namely, that it uninterruptedly enjoy the unchangeable good, which is God; and that it be delivered from all dubiety, and know certainly that it shall eternally abide in the same enjoyment.  That it is so with the angels of light we piously believe; but that the fallen angels, who by their own default lost that light, did not enjoy this blessedness even before they sinned, reason bids us conclude.  Yet if their life was of any duration before they fell, we must allow them a blessedness of some kind, though not that which is accompanied with foresight.  Or, if it seems hard to believe that, when the angels were created, some were created in ignorance either of their perseverance or their fall, while others were most certainly assured of the eternity of their felicity,—if it is hard to believe that they were not all from the beginning on an equal footing, until these who are now evil did of their own will fall away from the light of goodness, certainly it is much harder to believe that the holy angels are now uncertain of their eternal blessedness, and do not know regarding themselves as much as we have been able to gather regarding them from the Holy Scriptures.  For what catholic Christian does not know that no new devil will ever arise among the good angels, as he knows that this present devil will never again return  <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 213</font></a> <a name="iv.XI.13-Page_213"></a>  into the fellowship of the good?  For the truth in the gospel promises to the saints and the faithful that they will be equal to the angels of God; and it is also promised them that they will “go away into life eternal.” <a name="fr_473"></a><a href="#fn_473"><font size="1">474</font></a>
   But if we are certain that we shall never lapse from eternal felicity, while they are not certain, then we shall not be their equals, but their superiors.  But as the truth never deceives, and as we shall be their equals, they must be certain of their blessedness.  And because the evil angels could not be certain of that, since their blessedness was destined to come to an end, it follows either that the angels were unequal, or that, if equal, the good angels were assured of the eternity of their blessedness after the perdition of the others; unless, possibly, some one may say that the words of the Lord about the devil “He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth,” <a name="fr_474"></a><a href="#fn_474"><font size="1">475</font></a>
  are to be understood as if he was not only a murderer from the beginning of the human race, when man, whom he could kill by his deceit, was made, but also that he did not abide in the truth from the time of his own creation, and was accordingly never blessed with the holy angels, but refused to submit to his Creator, and proudly exulted as if in a private lordship of his own, and was thus deceived and deceiving.  For the dominion of the Almighty cannot be eluded; and he who will not piously submit himself to things as they are, proudly feigns, and mocks himself with a state of things that does not exist; so that what the blessed Apostle John says thus becomes intelligible:  “The devil sinneth from the beginning,” <a name="fr_475"></a><a href="#fn_475"><font size="1">476</font></a>
 —that is, from the time he was created he refused righteousness, which none but a will piously subject to God can enjoy.  Whoever adopts this opinion at least disagrees with those heretics the Manichees, and with any other pestilential sect that may suppose that the devil has derived from some adverse evil principle a nature proper to himself.  These persons are so befooled by error, that, although they acknowledge with ourselves the authority of the gospels, they do not notice that the Lord did not say, “The devil was naturally a stranger to the truth,” but “The devil abode not in the truth,” by which He meant us to understand that he had fallen from the truth, in which, if he had abode, he would have become a partaker of it, and have remained in blessedness along with the holy angels. <a name="fr_476"></a><a href="#fn_476"><font size="1">477</font></a>
