 <p class="c21"><a name="iv.III.28-p2"></a>Then followed the victory of Sylla, the so-called avenger of the cruelties of Marius.  But not only was his victory purchased with great bloodshed; but when hostilities were finished, hostility survived, and the subsequent peace was bloody as the war.  To the former and still recent massacres of the elder Marius, the younger Marius and Carbo, who belonged to the same party, added greater atrocities.  For when Sylla approached, and they despaired not only of victory, but of life itself, they made a promiscuous massacre of friends and foes.  And, not satisfied with staining every corner of Rome with blood, they besieged the senate, and led forth the senators to death from the curia as from a prison.  Mucius Scævola the pontiff was slain at the altar of Vesta, which he had clung to because  <a name="page_61"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 61</font></a> <a name="iv.III.28-Page_61"></a>  no spot in Rome was more sacred than her temple; and his blood well-nigh extinguished the fire which was kept alive by the constant care of the virgins.  Then Sylla entered the city victorious, after having slaughtered in the Villa Publica, not by combat, but by an order, 7000 men who had surrendered, and were therefore unarmed; so fierce was the rage of peace itself, even after the rage of war was extinct.  Moreover, throughout the whole city every partisan of Sylla slew whom he pleased, so that the number of deaths went beyond computation, till it was suggested to Sylla that he should allow some to survive, that the victors might not be destitute of subjects.  Then this furious and promiscuous licence to murder was checked, and much relief was expressed at the publication of the proscription list, containing though it did the death-warrant of two thousand men of the highest ranks, the senatorial and equestrian.  The large number was indeed saddening, but it was consolatory that a limit was fixed; nor was the grief at the numbers slain so great as the joy that the rest were secure.  But this very security, hard-hearted as it was, could not but bemoan the exquisite torture applied to some of those who had been doomed to die.  For one was torn to pieces by the unarmed hands of the executioners; men treating a living man more savagely than wild beasts are used to tear an abandoned corpse.  Another had his eyes dug out, and his limbs cut away bit by bit, and was forced to live a long while, or rather to die a long while, in such torture.  Some celebrated cities were put up to auction, like farms; and one was collectively condemned to slaughter, just as an individual criminal would be condemned to death.  These things were done in peace when the war was over, not that victory might be more speedily obtained, but that, after being obtained, it might not be thought lightly of.  Peace vied with war in cruelty, and surpassed it:  for while war overthrew armed hosts, peace slew the defenceless.  War gave liberty to him who was attacked, to strike if he could; peace granted to the survivors not life, but an unresisting death.</p>
