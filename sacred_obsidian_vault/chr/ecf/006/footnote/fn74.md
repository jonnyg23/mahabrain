 <sup>139 </sup><i>Consentes</i> (those who are together, or agree together, i. e, councillors) and <i>Complices</i> (confederate, or agreeing) are said by some to be the twelve gods who composed the great council of heaven; and, in accordance with this, the words <i>una oriantur et occidant una</i> might be translated "rise and sit down together," i.e., at the council table. But then, the names and number of these are known; while Arnobius says, immediately after, that the names of the dii Consentes are not known and has already quoted Varro, to the effect that neither names nor number are known. Schelling (über die Gotth. v. Samothr., quoted by Orelli) adopts the reading (see following note), "of whom very little mention is made," i.e., in prayers or rites, because they are merely Jove's councillors, and exercise no power over men, and identifies them with the Samothracian Cabiri-<font face="SPIonic">Ka/beiroi</font> and Consentes being merely Greek and Latin renderings of the name. </p>
