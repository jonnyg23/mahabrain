 <p class="c22"><a name="ii.v.li-p2"></a>To Virgilius and Syagrius, Bishops.</p> 
 <p class="c23"><a name="ii.v.li-p3"></a>Gregory to Virgilius, Bishop of Arelate (<i>Arles</i>), and Syagrius, Bishop of Augustodunum (<i>Autun</i>).</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.li-p4"></a>The nature of the office committed to me, dearest brethren, drives me to break out into a cry of grief, and to sharpen your love with the anxiety of charity, for that it is said that you in your parts have been too negligent and remiss, where the rectitude of justice and zeal for chastity ought to have inflamed your earnestness.  Now it has come to our ears that a certain Syagria had entered on a religious life, having even changed her dress, and was afterwards united by force to a husband (a thing iniquitous to be told), and that you have been moved by no sorrow to interfere in her defence.  If this is so, I groan for it the more heavily for fear lest with the Almighty Lord (which God forbid) you should have the office of hirelings, and not the merit of shepherds, as having left without a struggle a sheep in the mouth of the wolf to be torn.  For what will ye say, or what account will ye give of yourselves to the future judge; you whom the lewdness of ravishment has not moved, whom regard to the religious habit has in no wise excited to stand up in defence, whom priestly consideration has not roused to protect the purity of virgin modesty?  Even now, then, let your neglect return to your memory; let remembrance of this fault stir you, and consideration of your office impel you to exhortation of the aforesaid woman.  And, lest haply in course of time constraint should have passed into willing consent, let your tongue be her cure, and through your exhortations let her give herself diligently to prayer; let not the lamentations of penitence depart from her memory; let her exhibit a penitent heart to our Redeemer; and let her make amends with weeping for the loss of chastity, which in her body it was not allowed her to preserve.</p> 
 <p><a name="ii.v.li-p5"></a>Wherefore, inasmuch as the aforesaid woman desires, as it is said, even now to devote her property to pious uses, we exhort you that she experience the favour and enjoy the support of your Fraternity in this thing, and that it be lawful for her, a competent portion being reserved for her children, to decide as she will about her substance.  For without doubt you do good yourselves, if you render aid to those who wish to do good.  Consider, therefore, most beloved brethren, from how great love these things which we speak proceed, and take them all in the same spirit of charity that inspires them.  For, we being one body in Christ, I burn with you in <a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a> <a name="ii.v.li-Page_32"></a>this which I feel to be to your hurt.  And with what earnestness, and what affection I send you this epistle, may the Author of truth disclose to your hearts.  And so let not this brotherly admonition distress you, since even a bitter cup is taken gladly, when offered with a view to health.  Finally, dearest brethren, let us with united prayers implore the mercy of our God, that He would favourably order our life in His fear, to the end that we may both serve Him here as priests should do, and be able to stand in His sight hereafter secure and without fear.</p>
