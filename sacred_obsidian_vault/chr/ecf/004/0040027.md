 <p>  </p><h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> 2. A Strain of Sodom.</h2>  
 <p>(Author Uncertain.)</p>      <ul><ul>
 <p>Already had Almighty God wiped off</p>      
 <p>By vengeful flood (with waters all conjoined</p>      
 <p>Which heaven discharged on earth and the sea's plain<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm">1</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Outspued) the times of the primeval age:</p>      
 <p>5 Had pledged Himself, while nether air should bring</p>      
 <p>The winters in their course, ne'er to decree,</p>      
 <p>By <i>liquid</i> ruin, retribution's due;</p>      
 <p>And had assigned, to curb the rains, the bow</p>      
 <p>Of many hues, sealing the clouds with band</p>      
 <p>10 Of purple and of green, Iris its name,</p>      
 <p>The rain-clouds' proper baldric.<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2259_629247">2</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>But alike</p>      
 <p>With mankind's second race impiety</p>      
 <p>Revives, and a new age of ill once more</p>      
 <p>Shoots forth; allotted now no more to <i>showers</i></p>      
 <p>15 For ruin, but to <i>fires</i>: thus did the land</p>      
 <p>Of Sodom earn to be by glowing dews</p>      
 <p>Upburnt, and typically thus portend</p>      
 <p>The future end.<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2268_629537">3</a></sup> There wild voluptuousness</p>      
 <p> (Modesty's foe) stood in the room of law;</p>      
 <p>20 Which prescient guest would shun, and sooner choose</p>      
 <p>At Scythian or Busirian altar's foot</p>      
 <p>'Mid sacred rites to die, and, slaughtered, pour</p>      
 <p>His blood to Bebryx, or to satiate</p>      
 <p>Libyan palaestras, or assume new forms;</p>      
 <p>25 By virtue of Circaean cups, than lose</p>      
 <p>His outraged sex in Sodom. At heaven's gate</p>      
 <p>There knocked for vengeance marriages commit</p>      
 <p>With equal incest common 'mong a race</p>      
 <p>By nature rebels 'gainst themselves;<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2280_630043">4</a></sup> and hurts</p>      
 <p>30 Done to man's name and person equally.</p>      
 <p>But God, forewatching all things, at fix'd time</p>      
 <p>Doth judge the unjust; with patience tarrying</p>      
 <p>The hour when crime's ripe age-not any force</p>      
 <p>Of wrath impetuous-shall have circumscribed</p>      
 <p>35 The space for waiting.<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2287_630482">5</a></sup> Now at length the day</p>      
 <p>Of vengeance was at hand. Sent from the host</p>      
 <p>Angelical, two, youths in form, who both</p>      
 <p>Were ministering spirits,<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2291_631065">6</a></sup> carrying</p>      
 <p>The Lord's divine commissions, come beneath</p>      
 <p>40 The walls of Sodom. There was dwelling Lot</p>      
 <p>A transplantation from a pious stock; </p>      
 <p>Wise, and a practicer of righteousness,</p>      
 <p>He was the only one to think on God:</p>      
 <p>As oft a fruitful tree is wont to lurk,</p>      
 <p>45 Guest-like, in forests wild. He, sitting then</p>      
 <p>Before the gate (for the celestials scarce</p>      
 <p>Had reached the ramparts), though he knew not them</p>      
 <p>Divine,<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm">7</a></sup> accosts them unsolicited,</p>      
 <p>Invites, and with ancestral honour greets;</p>      
 <p>50 And offers them, preparing to abide</p>      
 <p>Abroad, a hospice. By repeated prayers</p>      
 <p>He wins them; and then ranges studiously</p>      
 <p>The sacred pledges<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2308_631981">8</a></sup> on his board,<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2309_632036">9</a></sup> and quits<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2310_632134">10</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>His friends with courteous offices. The night</p>      
 <p>55 Had brought repose: alternate<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2313_632910">11</a></sup> dawn had chased</p>      
 <p>The night, and Sodom with her shameful law</p>      
 <p>Makes uproar at the doors. Lot, suppliant wise,</p>      
 <p>Withstands: "Young men, let not your new fed lust</p>      
 <p>Enkindle you to violate this youth!<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2318_633166">12</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>60 Whither is passion's seed inviting you?</p>      
 <p>To what vain end your lust? For such an end</p>      
 <p>No creatures wed: not such as haunt the fens;</p>      
 <p>Not stall-fed cattle; not the gaping brood</p>      
 <p>Subaqueous; nor they which, modulant</p>      
 <p>65 On pinions, hang suspended near the clouds;</p>      
 <p>Nor they which with forth-stretched body creep</p>      
 <p>Over earth's face. To conjugal delight</p>      
 <p>Each kind its kind doth owe: but female still</p>      
 <p>To all is wife; nor is there one that has</p>      
 <p>70 A mother save a female one. Yet now,</p>      
 <p>If youthful vigour holds it right<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2331_633728">13</a></sup> to waste</p>      
 <p>The flower of modesty, I have within</p>      
 <p>Two daughters of a nuptial age, in whom</p>      
 <p>Virginity is swelling in its bloom,</p>      
 <p>75 Already ripe for harvest-a desire</p>      
 <p>Worthy of men-which let your pleasure reap!</p>      
 <p>Myself their sire, I yield them; and will pay</p>      
 <p>For my guests' sake, the forfeit of my grief!"</p>      
 <p>Answered the mob insane: "And who art thou7</p>      
 <p>80 And what? and whence? to lord it over us,</p>      
 <p>And to expound us laws? Shall foreigner</p>      
 <p>Rule Sodom, and hurl threats? Now, then, thyself</p>      
 <p>For daughters and for guests shalt sate our greed!</p>      
 <p>One shall suffice for all!" So said, so done:</p>      
 <p>85 The frantic mob delays not. As, whene'er</p>      
 <p>A turbid torrent rolls with wintry tide,</p>      
 <p>And rushes at one speed through countless streams</p>      
 <p>Of rivers, if, just where it forks, some tree</p>      
 <p>Meets the swift waves (not long to stand, save while</p>      
 <p>90 By her root's force she shall avail to oppose</p>      
 <p>Her tufty obstacles), when gradually</p>      
 <p>Her hold upon the undermined soil</p>      
 <p>Is failing, with her bared stem she hangs,</p>      
 <p>And, with uncertain heavings to and fro,</p>      
 <p>95 Defers her certain fall; not otherwise</p>      
 <p>Lot in the mid-whirl of the dizzy mob</p>      
 <p>Kept nodding, now almost o'ercome. But power</p>      
 <p>Divine brings succour: the angelic youths,</p>      
 <p>Snatching him from the threshold, to his roof</p>      
 <p>100 Restore him; but upon the spot they mulct</p>      
 <p>Of sight the mob insane in open day,-</p>      
 <p>Fit augury of coming penalties!</p>      
 <p>Then they unlock the just decrees of God:</p>      
 <p>That penalty condign from heaven will fall</p>      
 <p>105 On Sodom; that himself had merited</p>      
 <p>Safety upon the count of righteousness.</p>      
 <p>"Gird thee, then, up to hasten hence thy flight,</p>      
 <p>And with thee to lead oat what family</p>      
 <p>Thou hast: already we are bringing on</p>      
 <p>110 Destruction o'er the city." Lot with speed</p>      
 <p>Speaks to his sons-in-law; but their hard heart</p>      
 <p>Scorned to believe the warning, and at fear</p>      
 <p>Laughed. At what time the light attempts to climb</p>      
 <p>The darkness, and heaven's face wears double hue</p>      
 <p>115 From night and day, the youthful visitants</p>      
 <p>Were instant to outlead from Sodoma</p>      
 <p>The race Chaldaean,<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2378_635720">14</a></sup> and the righteous house</p>      
 <p>Consign to safety: "Ho! come, Lot! arise,</p>      
 <p>And take thy yokefellow and daughters twain,</p>      
 <p>120 And hence, beyond the boundaries be gone,</p>      
 <p>Preventing<sup><a href="footnote/fn23.htm#P2383_635984">15</a></sup> Sodom's penalties!" And eke</p>      
 <p>With friendly hands they lead them trembling forth,</p>      
 <p>And then their final mandates give: "Save, Lot,</p>      
 <p>Thy life, lest thou perchance should will to turn</p>      
 <p>125 Thy retroverted gaze behind, or stay</p>      
 <p>The step once taken: to the mountain speed!" </p>      
 <p>Lot feared to creep the heights with tardy step,</p>      
 <p>Lest the celestial wrath-fires should o'ertake</p>      
 <p>And whelm him: therefore he essays to crave</p>      
 <p>130 Some other ports; a city small, to wit,</p>      
 <p>Which opposite he had espied."Hereto,"</p>      
 <p>He said, "I speed my flight: scarce with its walls</p>      
 <p>'Tis visible; nor is it far, nor great."</p>      
 <p>They, favouring his prayer, safety assured</p>      
 <p>135 To him and to the city; whence the spot</p>      
 <p>Is known in speech barbaric by the name</p>      
 <p>Segor.<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm">16</a></sup> Lot enters Segor while the sun</p>      
 <p>Is rising,<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2402_636851">17</a></sup> the last sun, which glowing bears</p>      
 <p>To Sodom conflagration; for his rays</p>      
 <p>140 He had armed all with fire: beneath him spreads</p>      
 <p>An emulous gloom, which seeks to intercep</p>      
 <p>The light; and clouds combine to interweave</p>      
 <p>Their smoky globes with the confused sky:</p>      
 <p>Down pours a novel shower: the ether seethe</p>      
 <p>145 With sulphur mixt with blazing flames:<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2410_637294">18</a></sup>   the air</p>      
 <p>Crackles with liquid heats exust. From hence</p>      
 <p>The fable has an echo of the truth</p>      
 <p>Amid its false, that the sun's progeny</p>      
 <p>Would drive his father's team; but nought availed</p>      
 <p>150 The giddy boy to curb the haughty steeds</p>      
 <p>Of fire: so blazed our orb: then lightning reft</p>      
 <p>The lawless charioteer, and bitter plaint</p>      
 <p>Transformed his sisters. Let Eridanus</p>      
 <p>See to it, if one poplar on his banks</p>      
 <p>155 Whitens, or any bird dons plumage there</p>      
 <p>Whose note old age makes mellow!<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2422_637949">19</a></sup> </p>      
 <p><i>Here</i> they mourn</p>      
 <p>O'er miracles of metamorphosis</p>      
 <p>Of other sort. For, partner of Lot's flight,</p>      
 <p>His wife (ah me, for woman! even then<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2427_638656">20</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>160 Intolerant of law!) alone turned back</p>      
 <p>At the unearthly murmurs of the sky)</p>      
 <p>Her daring eyes, but bootlessly: not doomed</p>      
 <p>To utter what she saw! and then and there</p>      
 <p>Changed into brittle salt, herself her tomb</p>      
 <p>165 She stood, herself an image of herself,</p>      
 <p>Keeping an incorporeal form: and still</p>      
 <p>In her unsheltered station 'neath the heaven</p>      
 <p>Dures she, by rains unmelted, by decay</p>      
 <p>And winds unwasted; nay, if some strange hand</p>      
 <p>170 Deface her form, forthwith from her own store</p>      
 <p>Her wounds she doth repair. Still is she said</p>      
 <p>To live, and, 'mid her corporal change, discharge</p>      
 <p>With wonted blood her sex's monthly dues.</p>      
 <p>Gone are the men of Sodom; gone the glare</p>      
 <p>175 Of their unhallowed ramparts; all the house</p>      
 <p>Inhospitable, with its lords, is gone:</p>      
 <p>The champaign is one pyre; here embers rough</p>      
 <p>And black, here ash-heaps with hoar mould, mark out</p>      
 <p>The conflagration's course: evanished</p>      
 <p>180 Is all that old fertility<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2449_639615">21</a></sup>   which Lot,</p>      
 <p>Seeing outspread before him, ...</p>      
 <p>No ploughman spends his fruitless toil on glebes</p>      
 <p>Pitchy with soot: or if some acres there,</p>      
 <p>But half consumed, still strive to emulate</p>      
 <p>185 Autumn's glad wealth, pears, peaches, and all fruits</p>      
 <p>Promise themselves full easely<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2456_641065">22</a></sup> to the eye</p>      
 <p>In fairest bloom, until the plucker's hand</p>      
 <p>Is on them: then forthwith the seeming fruit</p>      
 <p>Crumbles to dust 'neath the bewraying touch,</p>      
 <p>190 And turns to embers vain.</p>      
 <p>Thus, therefore (sky</p>      
 <p>And earth entombed alike), not e'en the sea</p>      
 <p>Lives there: the quiet of that quiet sea</p>      
 <p>Is death!<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2465_641419">23</a></sup> -a sea which no wave animates</p>      
 <p>Through its anhealant volumes; which beneath </p>      
 <p>195 Its native Auster sighs not anywhere;</p>      
 <p>Which cannot from its depths one scaly race,</p>      
 <p>Or with smooth skin or cork-like fence encased,</p>      
 <p>Produce, or curled shell in single valve</p>      
 <p>Or double fold enclosed. Bitumen there</p>      
 <p>200 (The sooty reek of sea exust) alone,</p>      
 <p>With its own crop, a spurious harvest yields;</p>      
 <p>Which 'neath the stagnant surface vivid heat</p>      
 <p>From seething mass of sulphur and of brine</p>      
 <p>Maturing tempers, making earth cohere</p>      
 <p>205 Into a pitch marine.<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2478_642167">24</a></sup> At season due</p>      
 <p>The heated water's fatty ooze is borne</p>      
 <p>Up to the surface; and with foamy flakes</p>      
 <p>Over the level top a tawny skin</p>      
 <p>Is woven. They whose function is to catch</p>      
 <p>210 That ware put to, tilting their smooth skin. down</p>      
 <p>With balance of their sides, to teach the film,</p>      
 <p>Once o'er the gunnel, to float in: for, lo!</p>      
 <p>Raising itself spontaneous, it will swim</p>      
 <p>Up to the edge of the unmoving craft;</p>      
 <p>215 And will, when pressed,<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2489_642623">25</a></sup> for guerdon large, ensure</p>      
 <p>Immunity from the defiling touch</p>      
 <p>Of weft which female monthly efflux clothes.</p>      
 <p>Behold another portent notable,</p>      
 <p>Fruit of that sea's disaster: all things cast</p>      
 <p>220 Therein do swim: gone is its native power</p>      
 <p>For sinking bodies: if, in fine, you launch</p>      
 <p>A torch's lightsome<sup><a href="footnote/fn24.htm#P2497_642996">26</a></sup> hull (where spirit serves</p>

 <p>Will act as sail; put out the flame, and 'neath</p>      
 <p>225 The waters will the light's wrecks ruin go!</p>      
 <p>Such Sodom's and Gomorrah's penalties,</p>      
 <p>For ages sealed as signs before the eyes</p>      
 <p>Of unjust nations, whose obdurate hearts</p>      
 <p>God's fear have quite forsaken,<sup><a href="footnote/fn25.htm#P2505_643321">27</a></sup> will them teach</p>      
 <p>230 To reverence heaven-sanctioned rights,<sup><a href="footnote/fn25.htm#P2507_643418">28</a></sup> and lift</p>      </ul></ul>
