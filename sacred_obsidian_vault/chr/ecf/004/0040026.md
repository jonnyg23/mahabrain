 <p>  </p><h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> 1. A Strain of Jonah the Prophet.</h2>      <ul><ul>
 <p>After the living, aye-enduring death</p>      
 <p>Of Sodom and Gomorrah; after fires</p>      
 <p>Penal, attested by time-frosted plains</p>      
 <p>Of ashes; after fruitless apple-growths,</p>      
 <p>5 Born but to feed the eye; after the death</p>      
 <p>Of sea and brine, both in like fate involved;</p>      
 <p>While whatsoe'er is human still retains</p>      
 <p>In change corporeal its penal badge:<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm">1</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>A city-Nineveh-by stepping o'er</p>      
 <p>10 The path of justice and of equity,</p>      
 <p>On her own head had well-nigh shaken down</p>      
 <p>More fires of rain supernal. For what dread<sup><a href="footnote/fn20.htm#P2088_620288">2</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Dwells in a mind subverted? Commonly</p>      
 <p>Tokens of penal visitations prove</p>      
 <p>15 All vain where error holds possession. Still,</p>      
 <p>Kindly and patient of our waywardness,</p>      
 <p>And slow to punish, the Almighty Lord</p>      
 <p>Will launch no shaft of wrath, unless He first</p>      
 <p>Admonish and knock oft at hardened hearts,</p>      
 <p>20 Rousing with mind august presaging seers.</p>      
 <p>For to the merits of the Ninevites</p>      
 <p>The Lord had bidden Jonah to foretell</p>      
 <p>Destruction; but he, conscious that He spare;</p>      
 <p>The subject, and remits to suppliants</p>      
 <p>25 The dues of penalty, and is to good</p>      
 <p>Ever inclinable, was loth to face</p>      
 <p>That errand; lest he sing his seerly strain</p>      
 <p>In vain, and peaceful issue of his threats</p>      
 <p>Ensue. His counsel presently is flight:</p>      
 <p>30 (If, howsoe'er, there is at all the power</p>      
 <p>God to avoid, and shun the Lord's right hand</p>      
 <p>'Neath whom the whole orb trembles and is held</p>      
 <p>In check: but is there reason in the act</p>      
 <p>Which in<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm">3</a></sup> his saintly heart the prophet dares?)</p>      
 <p>35 On the beach-lip, over against the shores</p>      
 <p>Of the Cilicians, is a city poised,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2114_621439">4</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Far-famed for trusty port-Joppa her name.</p>      
 <p>Thence therefore Jonah speeding in a barque</p>      
 <p>Seeks Tarsus,<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2118_621550">5</a></sup> through the signal providence</p>      
 <p>40 Of the same God;<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2120_621749">6</a></sup> nor marvel is's, I ween,</p>      
 <p>If, fleeing from the Lord upon the lands,</p>      
 <p>He found Him in the waves. For suddenly</p>      
 <p>A little cloud had stained the lower air</p>      
 <p>With fleecy wrack sulphureous, itself<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2125_621957">7</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>45 By the wind's seed excited: by degrees,</p>      
 <p>Bearing a brood globose, it with the sun</p>      
 <p>Cohered, and with a train caliginous</p>      
 <p>Shut in the cheated day. The main becomes</p>      
 <p>The mirror of the sky; the waves are dyed so</p>      
 <p>50 With black encirclement; the upper air</p>      
 <p>Down rushes into darkness, and the sea</p>      
 <p>Uprises; nought of middle space is left;</p>      
 <p>While the clouds touch the waves, and the waves all</p>      
 <p>Are mingled by the bluster of the winds</p>      
 <p>55 In whirling eddy.'Gainst the renegade,</p>      
 <p>'Gainst Jonah, diverse frenzy joined to rave,</p>      
 <p>While one sole barque did all the struggle breed</p>      
 <p>'Twixt sky and surge. From this side and from that</p>      
 <p>Pounded she reels; 'neath each wave-breaking blow</p>      
 <p>60 The forest of her tackling trembles all; </p>      
 <p>As, underneath, her spinal length of keel,</p>      
 <p>Staggered by shock on shock, all palpitates;</p>      
 <p>And, from on high, her labouring mass of yard</p>      
 <p>Creaks shuddering; and the tree-like mast itself</p>      
 <p>65 Bends to the gale, misdoubting to be riven.</p>      
 <p>Meantime the rising<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2148_622907">8</a></sup> clamour of the crew</p>      
 <p>Tries every chance for barque's and dear life's sake:</p>      
 <p>To pass from hand to hand<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2151_623080">9</a></sup> the tardy coils</p>      
 <p>To tighten the girth's noose: straitly to bind</p>      
 <p>70 The tiller's struggles; or, with breast opposed,</p>      
 <p>T' impel reluctant curves. Part, turn by turn,</p>      
 <p>With foremost haste outbale the reeking well</p>      
 <p>Of inward sea. The wares and cargo all</p>      
 <p>They then cast headlong, and with losses seek</p>      
 <p>75 Their perils to subdue. At every crash</p>      
 <p>Of the wild deep rise piteous cries; and out</p>      
 <p>They stretch their hands to majesties of gods,</p>      
 <p>Which gods are none; whom might of sea and sky</p>      
 <p>Fears not, nor yet the less from off their poops</p>      
 <p>80 With angry eddy sweeping sinks them down.</p>      
 <p>Unconscious of all this, the guilty one</p>      
 <p>'Neath the poop's hollow arch was making sleep</p>      
 <p>Re-echo stertorous with nostril wide</p>      
 <p>Inflated: whom, so soon as he who guides</p>      
 <p>85 The functions of the wave-dividing prow</p>      
 <p>Saw him sleep-bound in placid peace, and proud</p>      
 <p>In his repose, he, standing o'er him, shook,</p>      
 <p>And said, "Why sing's", with vocal nostril, dreams,</p>      
 <p>In such a crisis? In so wild a whirl,</p>      
 <p>90 Why keep'st thou only harbour? Lo! the wave</p>      
 <p>Whelms us, and our one hope is in the gods.</p>      
 <p>Thou also, whosoever is thy god,</p>      
 <p>Make vows, and, pouring prayers on bended knee,</p>      
 <p>Win o'er thy country's Sovran!" Then they vote</p>      
 <p>95 To learn by lot who is the culprit, who</p>      
 <p>The cause of storm; nor does the lot belie</p>      
 <p>Jonah: whom then they ask, and ask again,</p>      
 <p>"Who? whence? who in the world? from what abode,</p>      
 <p>What people, hail'st thou?" He avows himself</p>      
 <p>100 A servant, and an over-timid one,</p>      
 <p>Of God, who raised aloft the sky, who based</p>      
 <p>The earth, who corporally fused the whole:</p>      
 <p>A renegade from Him he owns himself,</p>      
 <p>And tells the reason. Rigid turned they all</p>      
 <p>105 With dread."What grudge, then, ow'st thou <i>us</i>? What now</p>      
 <p>Will follow? By what deed shall we appease</p>      
 <p>The main?" For more and far more swelling grew</p>      
 <p>The savage surges. Then the seer begins</p>      
 <p>Words prompted by the Spirit of the Lord:<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2193_625295">10</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>110"Lo! I your tempest am; I am the sum</p>      
 <p>Of the world's<sup><a href="footnote/fn21.htm#P2196_626030">11</a></sup> madness: 'tis in me," he says,</p>      
 <p>"That the sea rises, and the upper air</p>      
 <p>Down rushes; land in me is far, death near,</p>      
 <p>And hope in God is none! Come, headlong hurl</p>      
 <p>115 Your cause of bane: lighten your ship, and cast</p>      
 <p>This single mighty burden to the main,</p>      
 <p>A willing prey!" But they-all vainly!-strive</p>      
 <p>Homeward to turn their course; for helm refused</p>      
 <p>To suffer turning, and the yard's stiff poise</p>      
 <p>120 Willed not to change. At last unto the Lord</p>      
 <p>They cry: "For one soul's sake give us not o'er</p>      
 <p>Unto death's maw, nor let us be besprent</p>      
 <p>With righteous blood, if thus Thine own right hand</p>      
 <p>Leadeth." And from the eddy's depth a whale</p>      
 <p>125 Outrising on the spot, scaly with shells,<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2211_626692">12</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Unravelling his body's train, 'gan urge</p>      
 <p>More near the waves, shocking the gleaming brine,</p>      
 <p>Seizing-at God's command-the prey; which, rolled</p>      
 <p>From the poop's summit prone, with slimy jaws</p>      
 <p>130 He sucked; and into his long belly sped</p>      
 <p>The living feast; and swallowed, with the man,</p>      
 <p>The rage of sky and main. The billowy waste</p>      
 <p>Grows level, and the ether's gloom dissolves;</p>      
 <p>The waves on this side, and the blasts on that, </p>      
 <p>135 Are to their friendly mood restored; and, where</p>      
 <p>The placid keel marks out a path secure,</p>      
 <p>White traces in the emerald furrow bloom.</p>      
 <p>The sailor then does to the reverend Lord</p>      
 <p>Of death make grateful offering of his fear;<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2226_627401">13</a></sup>   </p>      
 <p>140 Then enters friendly ports. Jonah the seer</p>      
 <p>The while is voyaging, in other craft</p>      
 <p>Embarked, and cleaving 'neath the lowest waves</p>      
 <p>A wave: his sails the intestines of the fish,</p>      
 <p>Inspired with breath ferine; himself, shut in;</p>      
 <p>145 By waters, yet untouched; in the sea's heart</p>      
 <p>And yet beyond its reach; 'mid wrecks of fleets</p>      
 <p>Half-eaten, and men's carcasses dissolved</p>      
 <p>In putrid disintegrity: in life</p>      
 <p>Learning the process of his death; but still-</p>      
 <p>150 To be a sign hereafter of the Lord<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2238_628243">14</a></sup> -</p>      
 <p>A witness was he (in his very self),<sup><a href="footnote/fn22.htm#P2240_628326">15</a></sup> </p>      </ul></ul>
 <p>Not of destruction, but of death's repulse.</p>
