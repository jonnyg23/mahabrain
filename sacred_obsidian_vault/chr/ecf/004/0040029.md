 <p>  </p><h2 align="CENTER"><a></a> 4. A Strain of the Judgment of the Lord.</h2>  
 <p>(Author Uncertain.)<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm">1</a></sup> </p>      <ul><ul>
 <p>Who will for me in fitting strain adapt</p>      
 <p>Field-haunting muses? and with flowers will grace</p>      
 <p>The spring-tide's rosy gales? And who will give</p>      
 <p>The summer harvest's heavy stalks mature?</p>      
 <p>5 And to the autumn's vines their swollen grapes?</p>      
 <p>Or who in winter's honour will commend</p>      
 <p>The olives, ever-peaceful? and will ope</p>      
 <p>Waters renewed, even at their fountainheads?</p>      
 <p>And cut from waving grass the leafy flowers?</p>      
 <p>10 Forthwith the breezes of celestial light</p>      
 <p>I will attune. Now be it granted me</p>      
 <p>To meet the lightsome<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2781_656415">2</a></sup> muses! to disclose</p>      
 <p>The secret rivers on the fluvial top</p>      
 <p>Of Helicon,<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2784_656495">3</a></sup> and gladsome woods that grow</p>      
 <p>15'Neath other star.<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2786_656611">4</a></sup> And simultaneously</p>      
 <p>I will attune in song the eternal flames;</p>      
 <p>Whence the sea fluctuates with wave immense:</p>      
 <p>What power<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2790_656843">5</a></sup> moves the solid lands to quake;</p>      
 <p>And whence the golden light first shot its rays</p>      
 <p>20 On the new world; or who from gladsome clay</p>      
 <p>Could man have moulded; whence in empty world<sup><a href="footnote/fn27.htm#P2794_657024">6</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Our race could have upgrown; and what the greed</p>      
 <p>Of living which each people so inspires;</p>      
 <p>What things for ill created are; or what</p>      
 <p>25 Death's propagation; whence have rosy wreaths</p>      
 <p>Sweet smell and ruddy hue; what makes the vine</p>      
 <p>Ferment in gladsome grapes away; and makes</p>      
 <p>Full granaries by fruit of slender stalks distended be; or makes the tree grow ripe </p>      
 <p>30 'Mid ice, with olives black; who gives to seeds</p>      
 <p>Their increments of vigour various;</p>      
 <p>And with her young's soft shadowings protects</p>      
 <p>The mother. Good it is all things to know</p>      
 <p>Which wondrous are in nature, that it may</p>      
 <p>35 Be granted us to recognise through all</p>      
 <p>The true Lord, who light, seas, sky, earth prepared,</p>      
 <p>And decked with varied star the new-made world;<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm">7</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>And first bade beasts and birds to issue forth;</p>      
 <p>And gave the ocean's waters to be stocked</p>      
 <p>40 With fish; and gathered in a mass the sands,</p>      
 <p>With living creatures fertilized. Such strains</p>      
 <p>With stately<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2816_657943">8</a></sup> muses will I spin, and waves</p>      
 <p>Healthful will from their fountainheads disclose:</p>      
 <p>And may this strain of mine the gladsome shower</p>      
 <p>45 Catch, which from placid clouds doth come, and flows</p>      
 <p>Deeply and all unsought into men's souls,</p>      
 <p>And guide it into our new-fumed lands</p>      
 <p>In copious rills.<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2823_658233">9</a></sup> Now come: if any one</p>      
 <p>Still ignorant of God, and knowing naught</p>      
 <p>50 Of life to come,<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2826_658506">10</a></sup> would fain attain to touch</p>      
 <p>The care-effacing living nymph, and through</p>      
 <p>The swift waves' virtue his lost life repair,</p>      
 <p>And'scape the penalties of flame eterne,<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2830_658680">11</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>And rather win the guerdons of the life</p>      
 <p>55 To come, let such remember God is One,</p>      
 <p>Alone the object of our prayers; who 'neath</p>      
 <p>His threshold hath the whole world poised; Himself</p>      
 <p>Eternally abiding, and to be</p>      
 <p>Alway for aye; holding the ages<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2837_659002">12</a></sup> all;</p>      
 <p>60 Alone, before all ages;<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2839_659047">13</a></sup> unbegotten,</p>      
 <p>Limitless God; who holds alone His seat</p>      
 <p>Supernal; supereminent alone</p>      
 <p>Above high heavens; omnipotent alone;</p>      
 <p>Whom all things do obey; who for Himself</p>      
 <p>65 Formed, when it pleased Him, man for aye; and gave</p>      
 <p>Him to be pastor of beasts tame, and lord</p>      
 <p>Of wild; who by a word<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2847_659333">14</a></sup> could stretch forth heaven;</p>      
 <p>And with a word could solid earth suspend;</p>      
 <p>And quicklier than word<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2850_659697">15</a></sup> had the seas wave</p>      
 <p>70 Disjoined;<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2852_659740">16</a></sup> and man's dear form with His own hands</p>      
 <p>Did love to mould; and furthermore did will</p>      
 <p>His own fair likeness<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2855_659903">17</a></sup> to exist in him;</p>      
 <p>And by His Spirit on his countenance</p>      
 <p>The breath<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2858_659979">18</a></sup> of life did breathe. Unmindful he</p>      
 <p>75 Of God, such guilt rashly t' incur I Beyond</p>      
 <p>The warning's range he was not ought to touch.<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2861_660132">19</a></sup>   </p>      
 <p>One fruit illicit, whence he was to know</p>      
 <p>Forthwith how to discriminate alike</p>      
 <p>Evil and equity, God him forbade</p>      
 <p>80 To touch. What functions of the world<sup><a href="footnote/fn28.htm#P2866_660472">20</a></sup> did God</p>      
 <p>Permit to man, and sealed the sweet sweet pledge</p>      
 <p>Of His own love! and jurisdiction gave</p>      
 <p>O'er birds, and granted him both deep and soil</p>      
 <p>To tame, and mandates useful did impart</p>      
 <p>85 Of dear salvation!'Neath his sway He gave</p>      
 <p>The lands, the souls of flying things, the race</p>      
 <p>Feathered, and every race, or tame or wild,</p>      
 <p>Of beasts, and the sea's race, and monsterforms</p>      
 <p>Shapeless of swimming things. But since so soon</p>      
 <p>90 The primal man by primal crime transgressed</p>      
 <p>The law, and left the mandates of the Lord</p>      
 <p> (Led by a wife who counselled all the ills),</p>      
 <p>By death he 'gan to perish. Woman 'twas</p>      
 <p>Who sin's first ill committed, and (the law</p>      
 <p>95 Transgressed) deceived her husband. Eve, induced</p>      
 <p>By guile, the thresholds oped to death, and proved</p>      
 <p>To her own self, with her whole race as well,</p>      
 <p>A procreatrix of funereal woes.</p>      
 <p>Hence unanticipated wickedness,</p>      
 <p>100 Hence death, like seed, for aye, is scattered. Then</p>      
 <p>More frequent grew atrocious deed; and toil</p>      
 <p>More savage set the corrupt orb astir:</p>      
 <p> (This lure the crafty serpent spread, inspired</p>      
 <p>By envy's self:) then peoples more invent</p>      
 <p>105 Practices of ill deeds; and by ill deeds</p>      
 <p>Gave birth to seeds of wickedness.</p>      
 <p>And so</p>      
 <p>The only Lord. whose is the power supreme. </p>      
 <p>Who o'er the heights the summits holds of heaven</p>      
 <p>Supreme, and in exalted regions dwells</p>      
 <p>110 In lofty light for ages, mindful too</p>      
 <p>Of present time, and of futurity</p>      
 <p>Prescient beforehand, keeps the progeny</p>      
 <p>Of ill-desert, and all the souls which move</p>      
 <p>By reason's force much-erring manf-nor less</p>      
 <p>115 Their tardy bodies governs He-against</p>      
 <p>The age decreed, so soon as, stretched in death,</p>      
 <p>Men lay aside their ponderous limbs, and light</p>      
 <p>As air, shall go, their earthly bonds undone,</p>      
 <p>And take in diverse parts their proper spheres</p>      
 <p>120 (But some He bids be forthwith by glad gales</p>      
 <p>Recalled to life, and be in secret kept</p>      
 <p>To wait the decreed law's awards, until</p>      
 <p>Their bodies with resuscitated limbs</p>      
 <p>Revive.<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm">21</a></sup> ) Then shall men 'gin to weigh the awards</p>      
 <p>125 Of their first life, and on their crime and faults</p>      
 <p>To think, and keep them for their penalties</p>      
 <p>Which will be far from death; and mindful grow</p>      
 <p>Of pious duties, by God's judgments taught;</p>      
 <p>To wait expectant for their penalty</p>      
 <p>130 And their descendants', fruit of their own crime;</p>      
 <p>Or else to live wholly the life of sheep,<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2920_663320">22</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Without a name; and in God's ear, now deaf,</p>      
 <p>Pour unavailing weeping. Shall not God</p>      
 <p>Almighty, 'neath whose law are all things ruled,</p>      
 <p>135 Be able after death life to restore?</p>      
 <p>Or is there ought which the creation's Lord</p>      
 <p>Unable seems to do? If, darkness chased,</p>      
 <p>He could outstretch the light, and could compound</p>      
 <p>All the world's mass by a word suddenly,</p>      
 <p>140 And raise by potent voice all things from <i>nought</i>,</p>      
 <p>Why out of <i>somewhat</i><sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2931_663778">23</a></sup> could He not compound</p>      
 <p>The well-known shape which erst had been, which He</p>      
 <p>Had moulded formerly; and bid the form</p>      
 <p>Arise assimilated to Himself</p>      
 <p>145 Again? Since God's are all things, earth the more</p>      
 <p>Gives Him all back; for she will, when He bids,</p>      
 <p>Unweave whate'er she woven had before.</p>      
 <p>If one, perhaps, laid on sepulchral pyre,</p>      
 <p>The flame consumed; or one in its blind waves</p>      
 <p>150 The ocean have dismembered; if of one</p>      
 <p>The entrails have, in hunger, satisfied</p>      
 <p>The fishes; or on any's limbs wild beasts</p>      
 <p>Have fastened cruel death; or any's blood,</p>      
 <p>His body reft by birds, unhid have lain:</p>      
 <p>155 Yet shall they not wrest from the mighty Lord</p>      
 <p>His latest dues. Need is that men appear</p>      
 <p>Quickened from death 'fore God, and at His bar</p>      
 <p>Stand in their shapes resumed. Thus arid seeds</p>      
 <p>Are drops into the vacant lands, and deep</p>      
 <p>160 In the fixt furrows die and rot: and hence</p>      
 <p>Is not their surface<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2952_664679">24</a></sup> animated soon</p>      
 <p>With stalks repaired? and do they<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2954_664774">25</a></sup> not grow strong</p>      
 <p>And yellow with the living grains? and, rich</p>      
 <p>With various usury,<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2957_664877">26</a></sup> new harvests rise</p>      
 <p>165 In mass? The stars all set, and, born again,</p>      
 <p>Renew their sheen; and day dies with its light</p>      
 <p>Lost in dense night; and now night wanes herself</p>      
 <p>As light unveils creation presently;</p>      
 <p>And now another and another day</p>      
 <p>170 Rises from its own stars; and the sun sets,</p>      
 <p>Bright as it is with splendour-bearing light;</p>      
 <p>Light perishes when by the coming eve</p>      
 <p>The world<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2967_665336">27</a></sup> is shaded; and the phoenix lives</p>      
 <p>By her own soot<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2969_665396">28</a></sup> renewed, and presently</p>      
 <p>175 Rises, again a bird, O wondrous sight!</p>      
 <p>After her burnings! The bare tree in time</p>      
 <p>Shoots with her leaves; and once more are her boughs</p>      
 <p>Curved by the germen of the fruits. While then</p>      
 <p>The world<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2975_665624">29</a></sup> throughout is trembling at God's voice,</p>      
 <p>180 And deeply moved are the high air's powers,<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2977_665724">30</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Then comes a crash unwonted, then ensue</p>      
 <p>Heaven's mightiest murmurs, on the approach of God,</p>      
 <p>The whole world's<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2981_665919">31</a></sup> Judge! His countless ministers</p>      
 <p>Forthwith conjoin their rushing march, and God </p>      
 <p>185 With majesty supernal fence around.</p>      
 <p>Angelic bands will from the heaven descend</p>      
 <p>To earth; all, God's host, whose is faculty</p>      
 <p>Divine; in form and visage spirits all</p>      
 <p>Of virtue: in them fiery vigour is;</p>      
 <p>190 Rutilant are their bodies; heaven's might</p>      
 <p>Divine about them flashes; the whole orb</p>      
 <p>Hence murmurs; and earth, trembling to her depths</p>      
 <p> (Or whatsoe'er her bulk is<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2992_666368">32</a></sup> ), echoes back</p>      
 <p>The roar, parturient of men, whom she,</p>      
 <p>195 Being bidden, will with grief upyield.<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2995_666790">33</a></sup> All stand</p>      
 <p>In wonderment. At last disturbed are</p>      
 <p>The clouds, and the stars move and quake from height</p>      
 <p>Of sudden power.<sup><a href="footnote/fn29.htm#P2999_667590">34</a></sup> When thus God comes, with voice</p>      
 <p>Of potent sound, at once throughout all realms</p>      
 <p>200 The sepulchres are burst, and every ground</p>      
 <p>Outpours bones from wide chasms, and opening sand</p>      
 <p>Outbelches living peoples; to the hair<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm">35</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>The members cleave; the bones inwoven are</p>      
 <p>With marrow; the entwined sinews rule</p>      
 <p>205 The breathing bodies; and the veins 'gin throb</p>      
 <p>With simultaneously infused blood:</p>      
 <p>And, from their caves dismissed, to open day</p>      
 <p>Souls are restored, and seek to find again</p>      
 <p>Each its own organs, as at their own place</p>      
 <p>210 They rise. O wondrous faith! Hence every age</p>      
 <p>Shoots forth; forth shoots from ancient dust the host</p>      
 <p>Of dead. Regaining light, there rise again</p>      
 <p>Mothers, and sires, and high-soured youths, and boys,</p>      
 <p>And maids unwedded; and deceased old men</p>      
 <p>215 Stand by with living souls; and with the cries</p>      
 <p>Of babes the groaning orb resounds.<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3019_668474">36</a></sup> Then tribes</p>      
 <p>Various from their lowest seats will come:</p>      
 <p>Bands of the Easterns; those which earth's extreme</p>      
 <p>Sees; those which dwell in the downsloping clime</p>      
 <p>220 Of the mid-world, and hold the frosty star's</p>      
 <p>Riphaean citadels. Every colonist</p>      
 <p>Of every land stands frighted here: the boor;</p>      
 <p>The son of Atreus<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3027_668853">37</a></sup> with his diadem</p>      
 <p>Of royalty put off; the rich man mixt</p>      
 <p>225 Coequally in line with pauper peers.</p>      
 <p>Deep tremor everywhere: then groans the orb</p>      
 <p>With prayers; and peoples stretching forth their hands</p>      
 <p>Grow stupid with the din! The Lord Himself</p>      
 <p>Seated, is bright with light sublime; and fire</p>      
 <p>230 Potent in all the Virtues<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3035_669264">38</a></sup> flashing shines.</p>      
 <p>And on His high-raised throne the Heavenly One</p>      
 <p>Coruscates from His seat; with martyrs hemmed</p>      
 <p> (A dazzling troop of men), and by His seers</p>      
 <p>Elect accompanied (whose bodies bright</p>      
 <p>235 Effulgent are with snowy stoles), He towers</p>      
 <p>Above them. And now priests in lustrous robes</p>      
 <p>Attend, who wear upon their marked<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3043_669599">39</a></sup> front</p>      
 <p>Wreaths golden-red; and all submissive kneel</p>      
 <p>And reverently adore. The cry of all</p>      
 <p>240 Is one: "O Holy, Holy Holy, God!"</p>      
 <p>To these<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3048_669903">40</a></sup> the Lord will mandate give, to range</p>      
 <p>The people in twin lines; and orders them</p>      
 <p>To set apart by number the depraved;</p>      
 <p>While such as have His biddings followed</p>      
 <p>245 With placid words He calls, and bids them, clad</p>      
 <p>With vigour-death quite conquered-ever dwell</p>      
 <p>Amid light's inextinguishable airs,</p>      
 <p>Stroll through the ancients' ever blooming realm,</p>      
 <p>Through promised wealth, through ever sunny swards,</p>      
 <p>250 And in bright body spend perpetual life.</p>      
 <p>A place there is, beloved of the Lord,</p>      
 <p>In Eastern coasts, where light is bright and clear,</p>      
 <p>And healthier blows the breeze; day is eterne,</p>      
 <p>Time changeless: 'tis a region set apart</p>      
 <p>255 By God, most rich in plains, and passing blest, </p>      
 <p>In the meridian<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3064_670672">41</a></sup> of His cloudless seat.</p>      
 <p>There gladsome the air, and is in light</p>      
 <p>Ever to be; soft is the wind, and breathes</p>      
 <p>Life-giving blasts; earth, fruitful with a soil</p>      
 <p>260 Luxuriant, bears all things; in the meads</p>      
 <p>Flowers shed their fragrance; and upon the plains</p>      
 <p>The purple-not in envy-mingles all</p>      
 <p>With golden-ruddy light. One gladsome flower,</p>      
 <p>With its own lustre clad, another clothes;</p>      
 <p>265 And here with many a seed the dewy fields</p>      
 <p>Are dappled, and the snowy tilths are crisped</p>      
 <p>With rosy flowers. No region happier</p>      
 <p>Is known in other spots; none which in look</p>      
 <p>Is fairer, or in honour more excels.</p>      
 <p>270 Never in flowery gardens are there born</p>      
 <p>Such lilies, nor do such upon our plains</p>      
 <p>Outbloom; nor does the rose so blush, what time,</p>      
 <p>New-born, 'tis opened by the breeze; nor is</p>      
 <p>The purple with such hue by Tyrian dye</p>      
 <p>275 Imbued. With coloured pebbles beauteous gleams</p>      
 <p>The gem: here shines the prasinus;<sup><a href="footnote/fn30.htm#P3085_671620">42</a></sup> there glows</p>      
 <p>The carbuncle; and giant-emerald</p>      
 <p>Is green with grassy light. Here too are born</p>      
 <p>The cinnamons, with odoriferous twigs;</p>      
 <p>280 And with dense leaf gladsome amomum Joins</p>      
 <p>Its fragrance. Here, a native, lies the gold</p>      
 <p>Of radiant sheen; and lofty groves reach heaven</p>      
 <p>In blooming time, and germens fruitfullest</p>      
 <p>Burden the living boughs. No glades like these</p>      
 <p>285 Hath Ind herself forth-stretcht; no tops so dense</p>      
 <p>Rears on her mount the pine; nor with a shade</p>      
 <p>So lofty-leaved is her cypress crisped;</p>      
 <p>Nor better in its season blooms her bough</p>      
 <p>In spring-tide. Here black firs on lofty peak</p>      
 <p>290 Bloom; and the only woods that know no hail</p>      
 <p>Are green eternally: no foliage falls;</p>      
 <p>At no time fails the flower. There, too, there blooms</p>      
 <p>A flower as red as Tarsine purple is:</p>      
 <p>A rose, I ween, it is (red hue it has,</p>      
 <p>295 An odour keen); such aspect on its leaves</p>      
 <p>It wears, such odour breathes. A tree it<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm">43</a></sup> stands,</p>      
 <p>With a new flower, fairest in fruits; a crop</p>      
 <p>Life-giving, dense, its happy strength does yield.</p>      
 <p>Rich honies with green cane their fragrance Join,</p>      
 <p>300 And milk flows potable in runners full;</p>      
 <p>And with whate'er that sacred earth is green,</p>      
 <p>It all breathes life; and there Crete's healing gift<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3113_672909">44</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Is sweetly redolent. tide,</p>      
 <p>Flows in the placid plains a fount: four floods</p>      
 <p>305 Thence water parted lands.<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3117_673049">45</a></sup> The garden robed</p>      
 <p>With flowers, I wot, keeps ever spring; no cold</p>      
 <p>Of wintry star varies the breeze; and earth,</p>      
 <p>After her birth-throes, with a kindlier blast</p>      
 <p>Repairs. Night there is none; the stars maintain</p>      
 <p>310 Their darkness; angers, envies, and dire greed</p>      
 <p>Are absent; and out-shut is fear, and cares</p>      
 <p>Driven from the threshold. Here the Evil One</p>      
 <p>Is homeless; he is into worthy courts</p>      
 <p>Out-gone, nor is't e'er granted him to touch</p>      
 <p>315 The glades forbidden. But here ancient faith</p>      
 <p>Rests in elect abode; and life here treads,</p>      
 <p>Joying in an eternal covenant;</p>      
 <p>And health<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3131_673711">46</a></sup> without a care is gladsome here</p>      
 <p>In placid tilths, ever to live and be</p>      
 <p>320 Ever in light.</p>      
 <p>Here whosoe'er hath lived</p>      
 <p>Pious, and cultivant of equity</p>      
 <p>And goodness; who hath feared the thundering God</p>      
 <p>With mind sincere; with sacred duteousness</p>      
 <p>Tended his parents; and his other life<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3139_674092">47</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>325 Spent ever crimeless; or who hath consoled</p>      
 <p>With faithful help a friend in indigence;</p>      
 <p>Succoured the over-toiling needy one,</p>      
 <p>As orphans' patron, and the poor man's aid;</p>      
 <p>Rescued the innocent, and succoured them</p>      
 <p>330 When press with accusation; hath to guests</p>      
 <p>His ample table's pledges given; hath done</p>      
 <p>All things divinely; pious offices</p>      
 <p>Enjoined; done hurt to none; ne'er coveted</p>      
 <p>Another's: such as these, exulting all</p>      
 <p>335 In divine praises, and themselves at once</p>      
 <p>Exhorting, raise their voices to the stars;</p>      
 <p>Thanksgivings to the Lord in joyous wise</p>      
 <p>They psalming celebrate; and they shall go </p>      
 <p>Their harmless way with comrade messengers.</p>      
 <p>340 When ended hath the Lord these happy gifts,</p>      
 <p>And likewise sent away to realms eterne</p>      
 <p>The just, then comes a pitiable crowd</p>      
 <p>Wailing its crimes; with parching tears it pours</p>      
 <p>All groans effusely, and attests<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3160_675066">48</a></sup> in acts</p>      
 <p>345 With frequent ululations. At the sight</p>      
 <p>Of flames, their merit's due, and stagnant pools</p>      
 <p>Of fire, wrath's weapons, they 'gin tremble all.<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3164_675416">49</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Them an angelic host, upsnatching them,</p>      
 <p>Forbids to pray, forbids to pour their cries</p>      
 <p>350 (Too late!) with clamour loud: pardon withheld,</p>      
 <p>Into the lowest bottom they are hurled!</p>      
 <p>O miserable men! how oft to you</p>      
 <p>Hath Majesty divine made itself known!</p>      
 <p>The sounds of heaven ye have heard; have seen</p>      
 <p>355 Its lightnings; have experienced its rains</p>      
 <p>Assiduous; its ires of winds and hail!</p>      
 <p>How often nights and days serene do make</p>      
 <p>Your seasons-God's gifts-fruitful with fair yields!</p>      
 <p>Roses were vernal; the grain's summer-tide</p>      
 <p>360 Failed not; the autumn variously poured</p>      
 <p>Its mellow fruits; the rugged winter brake</p>      
 <p>The olives, icy though they were: 'twas God</p>      
 <p>Who granted all, nor did His goodness fail.</p>      
 <p>At God earth trembled; on His voice the deep</p>      
 <p>365 Hung, and the rivers trembling fled and left</p>      
 <p>Sands dry; and every creature everywhere</p>      
 <p>Confesses God! Ye (miserable men!)</p>      
 <p>Have heaven's Lord and earth's denied; and oft</p>      
 <p> (Horrible!) have God's heralds put to flight;<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3187_676457">50</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>370 And rather slain the just with slaughter fell;</p>      
 <p>And, after crime, fraud ever hath in you</p>      
 <p>Inhered. Ye then shall reap the natural fruit</p>      
 <p>Of your iniquitous sowing. That God is</p>      
 <p>Ye know; yet are ye wont to laugh at Him.</p>      
 <p>375 Into deep darkness ye shall go of fire</p>      
 <p>And brimstone; doomed to suffer glowing ires</p>      
 <p>In torments just.<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3196_676796">51</a></sup> God bids your bones descend</p>      
 <p>To<sup><a href="footnote/fn31.htm#P3198_676898">52</a></sup> penalty eternal; go beneath</p>      
 <p>The ardour of an endless raging hell;<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm">53</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>380 Be urged, a seething mass, through rotant pools</p>      
 <p>Of flame; and into threatening flame He bids</p>      
 <p>The elements convert; and all heaven's fire</p>      
 <p>Descend in clouds. 3 Then greedy Tartarus</p>      
 <p>With rapid fire enclosed is; and flame</p>      
 <p>385 Is fluctuant within with tempest waves;</p>      
 <p>And the whole earth her whirling embers blends!</p>      
 <p>There is a flamy furrow; teeth acute</p>      
 <p>Are turned to plough it, and for all the years<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3210_677516">54</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>The fiery torrent will be armed: with force</p>      
 <p>390 Tartarean will the conflagrations gnash</p>      
 <p>Their teeth upon the world.<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3214_677688">55</a></sup> There are they scorched</p>      
 <p>In seething tide with course precipitate;</p>      
 <p>Hence flee; thence back are borne in sharp career;</p>      
 <p>The savage flame's ire meets them fugitive!</p>      
 <p>395 And now at length they own the penalty</p>      
 <p>Their own, the natural issue of their crime.</p>      
 <p>And now the reeling earth, by not a swain</p>      
 <p>Possest, is by the sea's profundity</p>      
 <p>Prest, at her farthest limit, where the sun</p>      
 <p>400 (His ray out-measured) divides the orb,</p>      
 <p>And where, when traversed is the world,<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3225_678145">56</a></sup> the stars</p>      
 <p>Are hidden. Ether thickens. O'er the light</p>      
 <p>Spreads sable darkness; and the latest flames</p>      
 <p>Stagnate in secret rills. A place there is</p>      
 <p>405 Whose nature is with sealed penalties</p>      
 <p>Fiery, and a dreadful marsh white-hot</p>      
 <p>With heats infernal, where, in furnaces</p>      
 <p>Horrific, penal deed roars loud, and seethes,</p>      
 <p>And, rushing into torments, is up-caught</p>      
 <p>410 By the flame's vortex wide; by savage wave</p>      
 <p>And surge the turbid sand all mingled is</p>      
 <p>With miry bottom. Hither will be sent,</p>      
 <p>Groaning, the captive crowd of evil ones,</p>      
 <p>And wickedness (the sinful body's train)</p>      
 <p>415 To burn! Great is the beating there of breasts,</p>      
 <p>By bellowing of grief accompanied;</p>      
 <p>Wild is the hissing of the flames, and thence</p>      
 <p>The ululation of the sufferers!</p>      
 <p>And flames, and limbs sonorous,<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3244_678895">57</a></sup> will outrise</p>      
 <p>420 Afar: more fierce will the fire burn; and up</p>      
 <p>To th' upper air the groaning will be borne.</p>      
 <p>Then human progeny its bygone deeds</p>      
 <p>Of ill will weigh; and will begin to stretch</p>      
 <p>Heavenward its palms; and then will wish to know </p>      
 <p>425 The Lord, whom erst it would not know, what time</p>      
 <p>To know Him had proved useful to them There,</p>      
 <p>His life's excesses, handiworks unjust,</p>      
 <p>And crimes of savage mind, each will confess,</p>      
 <p>And at the knowledge of the impious deeds</p>      
 <p>430 of his own life will shudder. And now first,</p>      
 <p>Whoe'er erewhile cherished ill thoughts of God;</p>      
 <p>Had worshipped stones unsteady, lyingly</p>      
 <p>Pretending to divinity; hath e'er</p>      
 <p>Made sacred to gore-stained images</p>      
 <p>435 Altars; hath voiceless pictured figures feared;</p>      
 <p>Hath slender shades of false divinity</p>      
 <p>Revered; whome'er ill error onward hath</p>      
 <p>Seduced; whoe'er was an adulterer,</p>      
 <p>Or with the sword had slain his sons; whoe'er</p>      
 <p>440 Had stalked in robbery; whoe'er by fraud</p>      
 <p>His clients had deferred; whoe'er with mind</p>      
 <p>Unfriendly had behaved himself, or stained</p>      
 <p>His palms with blood of men, or poison mixt</p>      
 <p>Wherein death lurked, or robed with wicked guise</p>      
 <p>445 His breast, or at his neighbour's ill, or gain</p>      
 <p>Iniquitous, was wont to joy; whoe'er</p>      
 <p>Committed whatsoever wickedness</p>      
 <p>Of evil deeds: him mighty heat shall rack,</p>      
 <p>And bitter fire; and these all shall endure,</p>      
 <p>450 In passing painful death, their punishment.</p>      
 <p>Thus shall the vast crowd lie of mourning men!</p>      
 <p>This oft as holy prophets sang of old,</p>      
 <p>And (by God's inspiration warned) oft told</p>      
 <p>The future, none ('tis pity!) none (alas!)</p>      
 <p>455 Did lend his ears. But God Almighty willed</p>      
 <p>His guerdons to be known, and His law's threats</p>      
 <p>'Mid multitudes of such like signs promulged.</p>      
 <p>He 'stablished them<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3284_680699">58</a></sup> by sending prophets more,</p>      
 <p>These likewise uttering words divine; and some,</p>      
 <p>460 Roused from their sleep, He bids go from their tombs</p>      
 <p>Forth with Himself, when He, His own tomb burst,</p>      
 <p>Had risen. Many 'wildered were, indeed,</p>      
 <p>To see the tombs agape, and in clear light</p>      
 <p>Corpses long dead appear; and, wondering</p>      
 <p>465 At their discourses pious, dulcet words!</p>      
 <p>Starward they stretch their palms at the mere sound,<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3293_681138">59</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>And offer God and so-victorious Christ</p>      
 <p>Their gratulating homage. Certain 'tis</p>      
 <p>That <i>these</i> no more re-sought their silent graves,</p>      
 <p>470 Nor were retained within earth's bowels shut;<sup><a href="footnote/fn32.htm#P3298_681409">60</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>But the remaining host reposes now</p>      
 <p>In lowliest beds, until-time's circuit run-</p>      
 <p>That great day do arrive. Now all of you</p>      
 <p>Own the true Lord, who alone makes this soul</p>      
 <p>475 Of ours to see His light,<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm#P3304_681625">61</a></sup> and can the same</p>      
 <p> (To Tartarus sent) subject to penalties;</p>      
 <p>And to whom all the power of life and death</p>      
 <p>Is open. Learn that God <i>can</i> do whate'er</p>      
 <p>He list; for 'tis enough for Him to <i>will</i>,</p>      
 <p>480 And by mere speaking He achieves the deed;</p>      
 <p>And Him nought plainly, by withstanding, checks.</p>      
 <p>He is my God alone, to whom I trust</p>      
 <p>With deepest senses. But, since death con</p>      
 <p>Every career, let whoe'er <i>is</i> to-day</p>      
 <p>485 Bethink him over all things in his mind.</p>      
 <p>And thus, while life remains, while 'tis allowed</p>      
 <p>To see the light and change your life, before</p>      
 <p>The limit of allotted age o'ertake</p>      
 <p>You unawares, and that last day, which<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm#P3319_682319">62</a></sup> is</p>      
 <p>490 By death's law fixt, your senseless eyes do glaze,</p>      
 <p>Seek what remains worth seeking: watchful be</p>      
 <p>For dear salvation; and run down with ease</p>      
 <p>And certainty the good course. Wipe away</p>      
 <p>By pious sacred rites your past misdeeds</p>      
 <p>495 Which expiation need; and shun the storms,</p>      
 <p>The too uncertain tempests, of the world.<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm#P3327_682749">63</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>Then turn to right paths, and keep sanctities.</p>      
 <p>Hence from your gladsome minds depraved crime</p>      
 <p>Quite banish; and let long-inveterate fault</p>      
 <p>500 Be washed forth from your breast; and do away</p>      
 <p>Wicked ill-stains contracted; and appease</p>      
 <p>Dread God by prayers eternal; and let all</p>      
 <p>Most evil mortal things to living good</p>      
 <p>Give way: and now at once a new life keep</p>      
 <p>505 Without a crime; and let your minds begin</p>      
 <p>To use themselves to good things and to true:</p>      
 <p>And render ready voices to God's praise.</p>      
 <p>Thus shall your piety find better things</p>      
 <p>All growing to a flame; thus shall ye, too,</p>      
 <p>510 Receive the gifts of the celestial life;<sup><a href="footnote/fn33.htm#P3342_683363">64</a></sup> </p>      
 <p>And, to long age, shall ever live with God,</p>      </ul></ul>
 <p>Seeing the starry kingdom's golden joys. </p>
