 <p class="c19"><a name="vi.vii.xvi-p2"></a>This is the rule, this the discipline, these the works of patience <i>which is</i> heavenly and true; that is, of Christian <i>patience</i>, not false and disgraceful, like as is that patience of the nations of the earth. For in order that in this also the devil might rival the Lord, he has as it were quite on a par (except that the very diversity of evil and good is exactly on a par with their magnitude <a name="fr_9180"></a><a href="#fn_9180"><font size="1">9181</font></a>
 ) taught <i>his disciples</i> also a patience of his own; that, I mean, which, making husbands venal for dowry, and teaching them to trade in panderings, makes them subject to the power of their wives; which, with feigned affection, undergoes every toil of forced complaisance, <a name="fr_9181"></a><a href="#fn_9181"><font size="1">9182</font></a>
  with a view to ensnaring the childless; <a name="fr_9182"></a><a href="#fn_9182"><font size="1">9183</font></a>
  which makes the slaves of the belly <a name="fr_9183"></a><a href="#fn_9183"><font size="1">9184</font></a>
  submit to contumelious patronage, in the subjection of their liberty to their gullet. Such pursuits of patience the Gentiles are acquainted with; and they eagerly seize a name of so great goodness to apply it to foul practises:  patient they live of rivals, and of the rich, and of such as give them invitations; impatient of God alone. But let their own and their leaders patience look to itself—<i>a patience</i> which the subterraneous fire awaits! Let us, on the other hand, love the patience of God, the patience of Christ; let us repay to Him the <i>patience</i> which He has paid down for us! Let us offer <i>to Him</i> the patience of the spirit, the patience of the flesh, believing as we do in the resurrection of flesh and spirit.</p>
