 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p1.1"></a>Chapter XVI</span>.—<i>How Licinius counseled his Soldiers not to attack the Standard of the Cross.</i></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p2"></a><span class="c11"><a name="iv.vi.ii.xvi-p2.1"></a>Having</span> now learned by experience the Divine and mysterious power which resided in the salutary trophy, by means of which Constantines army had become habituated to victory, he admonished his soldiers never to direct their attack against this standard, nor even incautiously to allow their eyes to rest upon it; assuring them that it possessed a terrible power, and was especially hostile to him; so that they would do well carefully to avoid any collision with it. And now, having given these directions, he prepared for a decisive conflict with him whose humanity prompted him still to hesitate, and to postpone the fate which he foresaw awaited his adversary. The enemy, however, confident in the aid of a multitude of gods, advanced to the attack with a powerful array of military force, preceded by certain images of the dead, and lifeless statues, as their defense. On the other side, the emperor, secure in the armor of godliness, opposed to the numbers of the enemy the salutary and life-giving sign, as at once a terror to the foe, and a protection from every harm. And for a while he paused, and preserved at first the attitude of forbearance, from respect to the treaty of peace to which he had given his sanction, that he might not be the first to commence the contest.</p>
