 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p2.1"></a>One</span> epistle of Peter, that called the first, is acknowledged as genuine. <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">578</font></a>
  And this the ancient elders <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">579</font></a>
  used freely in their own writings as an undisputed work. <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">580</font></a>
  But we have learned that his extant second Epistle does not belong to the canon; <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">581</font></a>
  yet, as it has appeared profitable to many, it has been used with the other Scriptures. <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">582</font></a>

 <p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p8"></a>2. The so-called Acts of Peter, <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">583</font></a>
  however, and the Gospel <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">584</font></a>
  which bears his name, and the Preaching <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">585</font></a>
  and the <a name="page_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a> <a name="iii.viii.iii-Page_134"></a>Apocalypse, <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">586</font></a>
  as they are called, we know have not been universally accepted, <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">587</font></a>
  because no ecclesiastical writer, ancient or modern, has made use of testimonies drawn from them. <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">588</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p15"></a>3. But in the course of my history I shall be careful to show, in addition to the official succession, what ecclesiastical writers have from time to time made use of any of the disputed works, <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">589</font></a>
  and what they have said in regard to the canonical and accepted writings, <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">590</font></a>
  as well as in regard to those which are not of this class.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p18"></a>4. Such are the writings that bear the name of Peter, only one of which I know to be genuine <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">591</font></a>
  and acknowledged by the ancient elders. <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">592</font></a>

 <p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p21"></a>5. Pauls fourteen epistles are well known and undisputed. <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">593</font></a>
  It is not indeed right to overlook the fact that some have rejected the Epistle to the Hebrews, <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">594</font></a>
  saying that it is dis<a name="page_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a> <a name="iii.viii.iii-Page_135"></a>puted <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">595</font></a>
  by the church of Rome, on the ground that it was not written by Paul. But what has been said concerning this epistle by those who lived before our time I shall quote in the proper place. <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">596</font></a>
  In regard to the so-called Acts of Paul, <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">597</font></a>
  I have not found them among the undisputed writings. <a name="fr_597"></a><a href="#fn_597"><font size="1">598</font></a>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p28"></a>6. But as the same apostle, in the salutations at the end of the Epistle to the Romans, <a name="fr_598"></a><a href="#fn_598"><font size="1">599</font></a>
  has made mention among others of Hermas, to whom the book called The Shepherd <a name="fr_599"></a><a href="#fn_599"><font size="1">600</font></a>
  is ascribed, it should be observed that this too has been disputed by some, and on their account cannot be placed among the acknowledged books; while by others it is considered quite indispensable, especially to those who need instruction in the elements of the faith. Hence, as we know, it has been publicly read in churches, and I have found that some of the most ancient writers used it.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p32"></a>7. This will serve to show the divine writings that are undisputed as well as those that are not universally acknowledged.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p3"></a> The testimony of tradition is unanimous for the authenticity of the first Epistle of Peter. It was known to Clement of Rome, Polycarp, Papias, Hermas, &amp;c. (the Muratorian Fragment, however, omits it), and was cited under the name of Peter by Irenæus, Tertullian, and Clement of Alexandria, from whose time its canonicity and Petrine authorship were established, so that Eusebius rightly puts it among the <i>homologoumena.</i> Semler, in 1784, was the first to deny its direct Petrine authorship, and Cludius, in 1808, pronounced it absolutely ungenuine. The Tübingen School followed, and at the present time the genuineness is denied by all the negative critics, chiefly on account of the strong Pauline character of the epistle (cf. Holtzmann, <i>Einleitung,</i> p. 487 sqq., also Weiss, <i>Einleitung,</i> p. 428 sqq., who confines the resemblances to the Epistles to the Romans and to the Ephesians, and denies the general Pauline character of the epistle). The great majority of scholars, however, maintain the Petrine authorship. A new opinion, expressed by Harnack, upon the assumption of the distinctively Pauline character of the epistle, is that it was written during the apostolic age by some follower of Paul, and that the name of Peter was afterward attached to it, so that it represents no fraud on the part of the writer, but an effort of a later age to find an author for the anonymous epistle. In support of this is urged the fact that though the epistle is so frequently quoted in the second century, it is never connected with Peters name until the time of Irenæus. (Cf. Harnacks <i>Lehre der Zwölf Apostel,</i> p. 106, note, and his <i>Dogmengeschichte</i>, I. p. 278, note 2.) This theory has found few supporters.</p>

The authorship of the second Epistle of Peter has always been widely disputed. The external testimony for it is very weak, as no knowledge of it can be proved to have existed before the third century. Numerous explanations have been offered by apologists to account for this curious fact; but it still remains almost inexplicable, if the epistle be accepted as the work of the apostle. The first clear references to it are made by Firmilian, Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia (third century), in his Epistle to Cyprian, §6 (<i>Ep.</i> 74, in the collection of Cyprians Epistles, <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers,</i> Am. ed., V. p. 391), and by Origen (quoted by Eusebius, VI. 25, below), who mentions the second Epistle as disputed. Clement of Alexandria, however, seems at least to have known and used it (according to Euseb. VI. 14). The epistle was not admitted into the Canon until the Council of Hippo, in 393, when all doubts and discussion ceased until the Reformation. It is at present disputed by all negative critics, and even by many otherwise conservative scholars. Those who defend its genuineness date it shortly before the death of Peter, while the majority of those who reject it throw it into the second century,—some as late as the time of Clement of Alexandria (e.g. Harnack, in his <i>Lehre der Zwölf Apostel,</i> p. 15 and 159, who assigns its composition to Egypt). Cf. Holtzmann, <i>Einleitung,</i> p. 495 sqq., and Weiss (who leaves its genuineness an open question), <i>Einleitung,</i> p. 436 sqq. For a defense of the genuineness, see especially Warfield, in the <i>Southern Pres. Rev.,</i> 1883, p. 390 sqq., and Salmons <i>Introduction to the N. T.,</i> p. 512 sqq.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p7"></a> Although disputed by many, as already remarked, and consequently not looked upon as certainly canonical until the end of the fourth century, the epistle was yet used, as Eusebius says, quite widely from the time of Origen on, e.g. by Origen, Firmilian, Cyprian, Hippolytus, Methodius, etc. The same is true, however, of other writings, which the Church afterward placed among the Apocrypha.</p>
 <a name="fn_582"></a><a href="2010072.htm#fr_582">133:583</a> <a name="iii.viii.iii-p8.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p9"></a> These <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p9.1"></a>πρ€ξεις</span> (or <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p9.2"></a>περίοδοι</span>, as they are often called) <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p9.3"></a>Πέτρου</span> were of heretical origin, according to Lipsius, and belonged, like the heretical <i>Acta Pauli</i> (referred to in note 20, below), to the collection of <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p9.4"></a>περίοδοι τῶν ἀποστόλων</span>, which were ascribed to Lucius Charinus, and, like them, formed also, from the end of the fourth century, a part of the Manichean Canon of the New Testament. The work, as a whole, is no longer extant, but a part of it is preserved, according to Lipsius, in a late Catholic redaction, under the title <i>Passio Petri.</i> Upon these <i>Acts of Peter,</i> their original form, and their relation to other works of the same class, see Lipsius, <i>Apocryphen Apostelgeschichten,</i> II. I, p. 78 sq. Like the heretical <i>Acta Pauli</i> already referred to, this work, too, was used in the composition of the Catholic <i>Acts of Paul and Peter,</i> which are still extant, and which assumed their present form in the fifth century, according to Lipsius. These Catholic <i>Acts of Peter and Paul</i> have been published by Thilo (<i>Acta Petri et Pauli,</i> Halle, 1837), and by Tischendorf, in his <i>Acta Apost. Apocr.,</i> p. 1–39. English translation in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers</i> (Am. ed.), VIII. p. 477.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p10"></a> This Gospel is mentioned by Serapion as in use in the church of Rhossus (quoted by Eusebius, Bk. VI. chap. 12, below), but was rejected by him because of the heretical doctrines which it contained. It is mentioned again by Eusebius, III. 25, only to be rejected as heretical; also by Origen (<i>in Matt.</i> Vol. X. 17) and by Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 1), who follows Eusebius in pronouncing it an heretical work employed by no early teachers of the Christian Church. Lipsius regards it as probably a Gnostic recast of one of the Canonical Gospels. From Serapions account of this Gospel (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 12), we see that it differs from the Canonical Gospels, not in denying their truth, or in giving a contradictory account of Christs life, but rather in adding to the account given by them. This, of course, favors Lipsius hypothesis; and in any case he is certainly quite right in denying that the Gospel was an original work made use of by Justin Martyr, and that it in any way lay at the base of our present Gospel of Mark. The Gospel (as we learn from the same chapter) was used by the <i>Docetæ,</i> but that does not imply that it contained what we call Docetic ideas of Christs body (cf. note 8 on that chapter). The Gospel is no longer extant. See Lipsius, in Smith and Waces <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> II. p. 712.</p>
 <a name="fn_584"></a><a href="2010072.htm#fr_584">133:585</a> <a name="iii.viii.iii-p10.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p11"></a> This <i>Preaching of Peter</i> (<span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p11.1"></a>Κήρυγμα Πέτρου</span>, <i>Prædicatio Petri</i>), which is no longer extant, probably formed a part of a lost <i>Preaching of Peter and Paul</i> (cf. Clement of Alexandria, <i>Strom.</i> VI. 5, and Lactantius, <i>Inst.</i> IV. 21). It was mentioned frequently by the early Fathers, and a number of fragments of it have been preserved by Clement of Alexandria, who quotes it frequently as a genuine record of Peters teaching. (The fragments are collected by Grabe in his <i>Spic. Patr.</i> I. 55–71, and by Hilgenfeld in his <i>N. T. extra Can. rec.,</i> 2d ed., IV. p. 51 sqq.). It is mentioned twice by Origen (<i>in Johan.</i> XIII. 17, and <i>De Princ.</i> Præf. 8), and in the latter place is expressly classed among spurious works. It was probably, according to Lipsius, closely connected with the <i>Acts of Peter and Paul</i> mentioned in note 6, above. Lipsius, however, regards those <i>Acts</i> as a Catholic adaptation of a work originally Ebionitic, though he says expressly that the <i>Preaching</i> is not at all of that character, but is a Petro-Pauline production, and is to be distinguished from the Ebionitic <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p11.2"></a>κηρύγματα</span>. It would seem therefore that he must put the <i>Preaching</i> later than the original of the <i>Acts,</i> into a time when the Ebionitic character of the latter had been done away with. Salmon meanwhile holds that the <i>Preaching</i> is as old as the middle of the second century and the most ancient of the works recording Peters preaching, and hence (if this view be accepted) the Ebionitic character which Lipsius ascribes to the <i>Acts</i> did not (if it existed at all) belong to the original form of the record of Peters preaching embodied in the <i>Acts</i> and in the <i>Preaching.</i> The latter (if it included also the <i>Preaching of Paul,</i> as seems almost certain) appears to have contained an account of some of the events of the life of Christ, and it may have been used by Justin. Compare the remarks of Lipsius in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> I. p. 28 (<i>Cath. Adaptations of Ebionitic Acts</i>), and Salmons article on the <i>Preaching of Peter, ibid.</i> IV. 329.</p>
 <a name="fn_585"></a><a href="2010072.htm#fr_585">134:586</a> <a name="iii.viii.iii-p11.3"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p12"></a> The <i>Apocalypse of Peter</i> enjoyed considerable favor in the early Church and was accepted by some Fathers as a genuine work of the apostle. It is mentioned in the Muratorian Fragment in connection with the Apocalypse of John, as a part of the Roman Canon, and is accepted by the author of the fragment himself; although he says that some at that time rejected it. Clement of Alexandria, in his <i>Hypotyposes</i> (according to Eusebius, IV. 14, below), commented upon it, thus showing that it belonged at that time to the Alexandrian Canon. In the third century it was still received in the North African Church (so Harnack, who refers to the stichometry of the Codex Claramontanus). The <i>Eclogæ or Prophetical Selections</i> of Clement of Alexandria give it as a genuine work of Peter (§§41, 48, 49, p. 1000 sq., Potters ed.), and so Methodius of Tyre (<i>Sympos.</i> XI. 6, p. 16, ed. Jahn, according to Lipsius). After Eusebius time the work seems to have been universally regarded as spurious, and thus, as its canonicity depended upon its apostolic origin (see chap. 24, note 19), it gradually fell out of the Canon. It nevertheless held its place for centuries among the semi-scriptural books, and was read in many churches. According to Sozomen, <i>H. E.</i> VII. 19, it was read at Easter, which shows that it was treated with especial respect. Nicephorus in his <i>Stichometry</i> puts it among the Antilegomena, in immediate connection with the Apocalypse of John. As Lipsius remarks, its “lay-recognition in orthodox circles proves that it could not have had a Gnostic origin, nor otherwise have contained what was offensive to Catholic Christians” (see Lipsius, <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> I. p. 130 sqq.). Only a few fragments of the work are extant, and these are given by Hilgenfeld, in his <i>Nov. Test. extra Can. receptum,</i> IV. 74 sq., and by Grabe, <i>Spic. Patr.</i> I. 71 sqq.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p22"></a> The thirteen Pauline Epistles of our present Canon, and the Epistle to the Hebrews. These formed for Eusebius an absolutely undisputed part of the Canon (cf. chap. 25, below, where he speaks of them with the same complete assurance), and were universally accepted until the present century. The external testimony for all of them is ample, going back (the Pastoral Epistles excepted) to the early part of the second century. The Epistles to the Romans, Corinthians, and Galatians have never been disputed (except by an individual here and there, especially during the last few years in Holland), even the Tübingen School accepting them as genuine works of Paul. The other epistles have not fared so well. The genuineness of Ephesians was first questioned by Usteri in 1824 and De Wette in 1826, and the Tübingen School rejected it. Scholars are at present greatly divided; the majority of negative critics reject it, while many liberal and all conservative scholars defend it. Colossians was first attacked by Mayerhoff in 1838, followed by the whole Tübingen School. It fares to-day somewhat better than Ephesians. It is still, however, rejected by many extreme critics, while others leave the matter in suspense (e.g. Weizsäcker in his <i>Apostolisches Zeitalter</i>). Since 1872, when the theory was proposed by Holtzmann, some scholars have held that our present Epistle contains a genuine Epistle of Paul to the Colossians, of which it is a later revision and expansion. Baur and the Tübingen School were the first to attack Philippians as a whole, and it too is still rejected by many critics, but at the same time it is more widely accepted than either Ephesians or Colossians (e.g. Weizsäcker and even Hilgenfeld defend its genuineness). Second Thessalonians was first attacked by Schmidt in 1801, followed by a number of scholars, until Baur extended the attack to the first Epistle also. Second Thessalonians is still almost unanimously rejected by negative critics, and even by some moderates, while First Thessalonians has regained the support of many of the former (e.g. Hilgenfeld, Weizsäcker, and even Holtzmann), and is entirely rejected by comparatively few critics. Philemon—which was first attacked by Baur—is quite generally accepted, but the Pastoral Epistles are almost as generally rejected, except by the regular conservative school (upon the Pastorals, see Bk. II. chap. 22, note 8, above). For a concise account of the state of criticism upon each epistle, see Holtzmanns <i>Einleitung.</i> For a defense of them all, see the <i>Einleitung</i> of Weiss.</p>
 <a name="fn_593"></a><a href="2010072.htm#fr_593">134:594</a> <a name="iii.viii.iii-p22.1"></a>
 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p23"></a> <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p23.1"></a>τινες ἠθετήκασι</span>. That the Epistle to the Hebrews was not written by Paul is now commonly acknowledged, and may be regarded as absolutely certain. It does not itself lay any claim to Pauline authorship; its theology and style are both non-Pauline; and finally, external testimony is strongly against its direct connection with Paul. The first persons to assign the epistle to Paul are Pantænus and Clement of Alexandria (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 14), and they evidently find it necessary to defend its Pauline authorship in the face of the objections of others. Clement, indeed, assumes a Hebrew original, which was translated into Greek by Luke. Origen (see below, Bk. VI. chap. 25) leaves its authorship undecided, but thinks it probable that the thoughts are Pauls, but the diction that of some one else, who has recorded what he heard from the apostle. He then remarks that one tradition assigned it to Clement of Rome, another to Luke. Eusebius himself, in agreement with the Alexandrians (who, with the exception of Origen, unanimously accept the Pauline authorship), looks upon it as a work of Paul, but accepts Clement of Alexandrias theory that it was written in Hebrew, and thinks it probable that Clement of Rome was its translator (see chap. 38, below). In the Western Church, where the epistle was known very early (e.g. Clement of Rome uses it freely), it is not connected with Paul until the fourth century. Indeed, Tertullian (<i>de pudicit.</i> 20) states that it bore the name of Barnabas, and evidently had never heard that it had been ascribed to any one else. The influence of the Alexandrians, however, finally prevailed, and from the fifth century on we find it universally accepted, both East and West, as an epistle of Paul, and not until the Reformation was its origin again questioned. Since that time its authorship has been commonly regarded as an insoluble mystery. Numerous guesses have been made (e.g. Luther guessed Apollos, and he has been followed by many), but it is impossible to prove that any of them are correct. For Barnabas, however, more can be said than for any of the others. Tertullian expressly connects the epistle with him; and its contents are just what we should expect from the pen of a Levite who had been for a time under Pauls influence, and yet had not received his Christianity from him; its standpoint, in fact, is Levitic, and decidedly non-Pauline, and yet reveals in many places the influence of Pauline ideas. Still further, it is noticeable that in the place where the Epistle to the Hebrews is first ascribed to Paul, there first appears an epistle which is ascribed (quite wrongly; see below, chap. 25, note 20) to Barnabas. May it not be (as has been suggested by Weiss and others) that the anonymous Epistle to the Hebrews was originally accepted in Alexandria as the work of Barnabas, but that later it was ascribed to Paul; and that the tradition that Barnabas had written an epistle, which must still have remained in the Church, led to the ascription of another anonymous epistle to him? We seem thus most easily to explain the false ascription of the one epistle to Paul, and the false ascription of the other to Barnabas. It may be said that the claims of both Barnabas and Apollos have many supporters, while still more attempt no decision. In regard to the canonicity of the epistle there seems never to have been any serious dispute, and it is this fact doubtless which did most to foster the belief in its Pauline authorship from the third century on. For the criterion of canonicity more and more came to be looked upon as apostolicity, direct or indirect. The early Church had cared little for such a criterion. In only one place does Eusebius seem to imply that doubts existed as to its canonicity,—in Bk. VI. chap. 13, where he classes it with the Book of Wisdom, and the Epistles of Barnabas, Clement, and Jude, among the <i>antilegomena.</i> But in view of his treatment of it elsewhere it must be concluded that he is thinking in that passage not at all of its canonicity, but of its Pauline authorship, which he knows is disputed by some, and in reference to which he uses the same word, <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p23.2"></a>ἀ</span><span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p23.3"></a>ντιλέγεσθαι</span>, in the present sentence. Upon the canonicity of the epistle, see still further chap. 25, note 1. For a discussion of the epistle, see especially the N. T. Introductions of Weiss and Holtzmann.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p26"></a> These <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p26.1"></a>πρ€ξεις</span> are mentioned also in chap. 25, below, where they are classed among the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p26.2"></a>νόθοι</span>, implying that they had been originally accepted as canonical, but were not at the time Eusebius wrote widely accepted as such. This implies that they were not, like the works which he mentions later in the chapter, of an heretical character. They were already known to Origen, who (<i>De Prin.</i> I. 2, 3) refers to them in such a way as to show that they were in good repute in the Catholic Church. They are to be distinguished from the Gnostic <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p26.3"></a>περίοδοι</span> or <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p26.4"></a>πρ€ξεις Παύλου</span>, which from the end of the fourth century formed a part of the Manichean canon of the New Testament, and of which some fragments are still extant under various forms. The failure to keep these Catholic and heretical <i>Acta Pauli</i> always distinct has caused considerable confusion. Both of these Acts, the Catholic and the heretical, formed, according to Lipsius (<i>Apokr. Apostelgeschichten,</i> II. 1, p. 305 sq.) one of the sources of the Catholic <i>Acts of Peter and Paul,</i> which in their extant form belong to the fifth century. For a discussion of these Catholic <i>Acts of Paul</i> referred to by Eusebius, see Lipsius, <i>ibid.,</i> p. 70 sq.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p29"></a> See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#014">Rom. xvi. 14</a><a name="iii.viii.iii-p29.1"></a>. The greater part of this last chapter of Romans is considered by many a separate epistle addressed to Ephesus. This has been quite a common opinion since 1829, when it was first broached by David Schulz (<i>Studien und Kritiken,</i> p. 629 sq.), and is accepted even by many conservative scholars (e.g. Weiss), while on the other hand it is opposed by many of the opposite school. While Aquila and Priscilla, of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#003">Rom. 16.3</a><a name="iii.viii.iii-p29.2"></a>, and Epænetus, of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#005">Rom. 16.5</a><a name="iii.viii.iii-p29.3"></a>, seem to point to Ephesus, and the fact that so many personal friends are greeted, leads us to look naturally to the East as Pauls field of labor, where he had formed so many acquaintances, rather than to Rome, where he had not been; yet on the other hand such names as Junias, Narcissus, Rufus, Hermas, Nereus, Aristobulus, and Herodion point strongly to Rome. We must, however, be content to leave the matter undecided, but may be confident that the evidence for the Ephesian hypothesis is certainly, in the face of the Roman names mentioned, and of universal tradition (for which as for Eusebius the epistle is a unit), not strong enough to establish it.</p>

 <p><a name="iii.viii.iii-p30"></a> The <i>Shepherd</i> of Hermas was in circulation in the latter half of the second century, and is quoted by Irenæus (<i>Adv. Hær.</i> IV. 20. 2) as Scripture, although he omits it in his discussion of Scripture testimonies in Bk. III. chap. 9 sqq., which shows that he considered it not quite on a level with regular Scripture. Clement of Alexandria and Origen often quote it as an inspired book, though the latter expressly distinguishes it from the canonical books, admitting that it is disputed by many (cf. <i>De Prin.</i> IV. 11). Eusebius in chap. 25 places it among the <span class="Greek"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p30.1"></a>νόθοι</span> or spurious writings in connection with the <i>Acts of Paul</i> and the <i>Apocalypse of Peter.</i> According to the Muratorian Fragment it was “written very recently in our times in the city of Rome by Hermas, while his brother, Bishop Pius, sat in the chair of the Church of Rome. And therefore it also ought to be read; but it cannot be made public in the Church to the people, nor placed among the prophets, as their number is complete, nor among the apostles to the end of time.” This shows the very high esteem in which the work was held in that age. It was very widely employed in private and in public, both in the East and the West, until about the fourth century, when it gradually passed out of use. Jerome (<i>de vir. ill.</i> 10) says that it was almost unknown among the Latins of his time. As to the date and authorship of the <i>Shepherd</i> opinions vary widely. The only direct testimony of antiquity is that of the Muratorian Fragment, which says that it was written by Hermas, the brother of Pius, during the episcopacy of the latter (139–154 <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p30.2"></a>a.d.</span>). This testimony is accepted by the majority of scholars, most of whom date the book near the middle of the second century, or at least as late as the reign of Hadrian. This opinion received not long ago what was supposed to be a strong confirmation from the discovery of the fact that Hermas in all probability quoted from Theodotions version of Daniel (see Horts article in the <i>Johns Hopkins University Circular,</i> December, 1884), which has been commonly ascribed to the second century. But it must now be admitted that no one knows the <i>terminus a quo</i> for the composition of Theodotians version, and therefore the discovery leaves the date of Hermas entirely undetermined (see Schürer, <i>Gesch. des jüdischen Volkes,</i> II. p. 709). Meanwhile Eusebius in this connection records the tradition, which he had read, that the book was written by the Hermas mentioned in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#000">Romans xvi</a><a name="iii.viii.iii-p30.3"></a>. This tradition, however, appears to be no older than Origen, with whom it is no more than a mere guess. While in our absence of any knowledge as to this Hermas we cannot absolutely disprove his claim (unless we prove decisively the late date of the book), there is yet no ground for accepting it other than a mere coincidence in a very common name. In <i>Vis.</i> II. 4. 3 Hermas is told to give one copy of his book to Clement. From this it is concluded by many that the author must have been contemporary with the well-known Roman Clement, the author of the Epistle to the Corinthians. While this appears very likely, it cannot be called certain in the face of evidence for a considerably later date. Internal testimony helps us little, as there is nothing in the book which may not have been written at the very beginning of the second century, or, on the other hand, as late as the middle of it. Zahn dates it between 97 and 100, and assigns it to an unknown Hermas, a contemporary of the Roman Clement, in which he is followed by Salmon in a very clear and keen article in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> Critics are unanimously agreed that the book was written in Rome. It consists of three parts, Visions, Mandates, and Similitudes, and is of the nature of an apocalypse, written for the purpose of reforming the life of the Church, which seemed to the author to have become very corrupt. The work (especially the last part) is in the form of an allegory, and has been compared to the <i>Pilgrims Progress.</i> Opinions are divided as to whether it is actually founded upon visions and dreams of the author, or is wholly a fiction. The former opinion seems to be the more probable.</p>  
 <p class="MsoEndnoteText"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p31"></a>Until recent years only a Latin translation of Hermas was known. In 1856 the first Greek edition was issued by Anger and Dindorf, being based upon a Mt. Athos <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p31.1"></a>ms.</span> discovered shortly before by Simonides. Of the ten leaves of the <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p31.2"></a>ms.</span> the last was lost; three were sold by Simonides to the University of Leipsic, and the other six were transcribed by him in a very faulty manner. The Sinaitic Codex has enabled us to control the text of Simonides in part, but unfortunately it contains only the <i>Visions</i> and a small part of the <i>Mandates.</i> All recent editions have been obliged to take the faulty transcription of Simonides as their foundation. In 1880 the six leaves of the Athos Codex, which had been supposed to be lost, and which were known only through Simonides transcription, were discovered by Lambros at Mt. Athos, and in 1888 <i>A Collation of the Athos Codex of the Shepherd of Hermas by Dr. Spyr Lambros</i> was issued in English translation by J. A. Robinson, at Cambridge, England. We thus have now a reliable Greek text of nine-tenths of the <i>Shepherd</i> of Hermas. Hilgenfeld, in his last edition (1887) of his <i>Novum Test. Extra Can. Rec.,</i> published also a Greek text of the lost part of the work, basing it upon a pretended transcription by Simonides from the lost Athos <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p31.3"></a>ms.</span> But this has been conclusively shown to be a mere fraud on the part of Simonides, and we are therefore still without any <span class="c13"><a name="iii.viii.iii-p31.4"></a>ms.</span> authority for the Greek text of the close of the work. Cf. Robinsons introduction to the <i>Collation of Lambros</i> mentioned above, and Harnacks articles in the <i>Theol. Literaturzeitung</i> (1887). The most useful edition of the original is that of Gebhardt and Harnack, <i>Patrum Apost. Opera,</i> Fasc. III. (Lips. 1877). The work is translated in the <i>Ante-Nicene Fathers,</i> Vol. II. The literature upon the subject is very extensive, but the reader should examine especially the Prolegomena of Harnack in his edition. Cf. Zahns <i>Hirt des Hermas</i> (1868), and the article by Salmon in the <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> II. p. 912 sqq. Cf. also chap. 24, note 20, in regard to the reasons for the non-canonicity of the <i>Shepherd.</i></p>
