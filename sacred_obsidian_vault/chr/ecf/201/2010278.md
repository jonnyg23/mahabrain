 </p><p class="c47"><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p1"></a>  <span class="c11"><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p1.1"></a>Chapter VII.</span></p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p2"></a>1. <span class="c13"><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p2.1"></a>Again</span>, in Cæsarea, when the persecution had continued to the fifth year, on the second day of the month Xanthicus, <a name="fr_2655"></a><a href="#fn_2655"><font size="1">2656</font></a>
  which is the fourth before the Nones of April, on the very Lords day of our Saviours resurrection, <a name="fr_2656"></a><a href="#fn_2656"><font size="1">2657</font></a>
  Theodosia, a virgin from Tyre, a faithful and sedate maiden, not yet eighteen years of age, went up to certain prisoners who were confessing the kingdom of Christ and sitting before the judgment seat, and saluted them, and, as is probable, besought them to remember her when they came before the Lord.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p5"></a>2. Thereupon, as if she had committed a profane and impious act, the soldiers seized her and led her to the governor. And he immediately, like a madman and a wild beast in his anger, tortured her with dreadful and most terrible torments in her sides and breasts, even to the very bones. And as she still breathed, and withal stood with a joyful and beaming countenance, he ordered her thrown into the waves of the sea. Then passing from her to the other confessors, he condemned all of them to the copper mines in Phæno in Palestine.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p6"></a>3. Afterwards on the fifth of the month Dius, <a name="fr_2657"></a><a href="#fn_2657"><font size="1">2658</font></a>
  on the Nones of November according to the Romans, in the same city, Silvanus <a name="fr_2658"></a><a href="#fn_2658"><font size="1">2659</font></a>
  (who at that time was a presbyter and confessor, but who shortly after was honored with the episcopate and died a martyr), and those with him, men who had shown the noblest firmness in behalf of religion, were condemned by him to labor in the same copper mines, command being first given that their ankles be disabled with hot irons.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p9"></a>4. At the same time he delivered to the flames a man who was illustrious through numerous other confessions. This was Domninus, who was well known to all in Palestine for his exceeding fearlessness. <a name="fr_2659"></a><a href="#fn_2659"><font size="1">2660</font></a>
  After this the same judge, who was a cruel contriver of suffering, and an inventor of devices against the doctrine of Christ, planned against the pious punishments that had never been heard of. He condemned three to single pugilistic combat. He delivered to be devoured by wild beasts Auxentius, a grave and holy old man. Others who were in mature life he made eunuchs, and condemned them to the same mines. Yet others, after severe tortures, he cast into prison.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p11"></a>Among these was my dearest friend Pamphilus, <a name="fr_2660"></a><a href="#fn_2660"><font size="1">2661</font></a>
  who was by reason of every virtue the most illustrious of the martyrs in our time.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p13"></a>5. Urbanus first tested him in rhetorical philosophy and learning; and afterwards endeavored to compel him to sacrifice. But as he saw that he refused and in nowise regarded his threats, being exceedingly angry, he ordered him to be tormented with severest tortures.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p14"></a>6. And when the brutal man, after he had almost satiated himself with these tortures by continuous and prolonged scrapings in his sides, was yet covered with shame before all, he put him also with the confessors in prison.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p15"></a>7. But what recompense for his cruelty to the saints, he who thus abused the martyrs of Christ, shall receive from the Divine judgment, may be easily determined from the preludes to it, in which immediately, and not long after his daring cruelties against Pamphilus, while he yet held the government, the Divine judgment came upon him. For thus suddenly, he who but yesterday was judging on the lofty tribunal, guarded by a band of soldiers, and ruling over the whole nation of Palestine, the associate and dearest friend and table companion of the tyrant himself, was stripped in one night, and overwhelmed with disgrace and shame before those who had formerly admired him as if he were himself an emperor; and he appeared cowardly and unmanly, uttering womanish cries and supplications to all the people whom he had ruled. And Maximinus himself, in reliance upon whose favor Urbanus was formerly so arrogantly insolent, as if he loved him exceedingly for his deeds against us, was set as a harsh and most severe judge in this same Cæsarea to pronounce sentence of death against him, for the great disgrace of the crimes of which he was convicted. Let us say this in passing.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p16"></a>8. A suitable time may come when we shall have leisure to relate the end and the fate of those impious <a name="page_349"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 349</font></a> <a name="iii.xiv.viii-Page_349"></a>men who especially fought against us, <a name="fr_2661"></a><a href="#fn_2661"><font size="1">2662</font></a>
  both of Maximinus himself and those with him.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p3"></a> i.e. April 2, 307. Eusebius is inconsistent with himself in this case. In chap. 3, above, he states that Apphianus suffered on April 2, in the third year of the persecution. But as shown in the note on that passage, Apphianus suffered in April, 306, and therefore, in that case, Eusebius reckons the first year of the persecution as beginning after the second of April. But in the present case he reckons it as beginning before the second of April, and the latter date as falling early in a new year of the persecution. That the martyrdom recorded in the present case actually took place in 307, and not in 308, as it must have done if Eusebius were consistent with himself, is proved, first, by the fact that, in entering upon this new chapter, he says, “the persecution having continued to the fifth year,” implying thereby that the event which he is about to relate took place at the beginning, not at the end, of the fifth year; and secondly, by the fact that later on, in this same chapter, while still relating the events of the fifth year, he recounts martyrdoms as taking place in the month of November (Dius). This is conclusive, for November of the fifth year can be only November, 307, and hence the April mentioned in the present paragraph can be only April of the same year. Evidently Eusebius did not reckon the beginning of the persecution in Palestine from a fixed day, but rather from the month Xanthicus (April). As a consequence, the inconsistency into which he has fallen is not very strange; the second day of April might easily be reckoned either as one of the closing days of a year, or as the beginning of the ensuing year. In the present case, he evidently forgot that he had previously used the former reckoning.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.xiv.viii-p17"></a> The death of Maximinus is related in Bk. IX. chap. 10. Nothing further is said in regard to Urbanus; but the fate of his successor Firmilianus is recorded in chap. 11, below. It is quite possible that Eusebius, in the present case, is referring to a more detailed statement of the fates of the various persecutors, which was to form the second part of the present work; and it is possible, still further, that the appendix printed at the close of the eighth book is a fragment of this second part, as suggested by Lightfoot (see above, p. 29).</p>
