 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.v.viii.iii-p1"></a>My ideas on this subject.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.v.viii.iii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.v.viii.iii-p2.1"></a>Then</span> I replied: The counsel or rather the authority of the Elder to whom we ought to  <a name="page_461"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 461</font></a> <a name="iv.v.viii.iii-Page_461"></a>refer our anxieties would make a short way out of our difficulties, and whatever is decided by his verdict, may, like a divine and heavenly reply, put an end to all our troubles. And we need not have any doubt of what is given to us by the Lord through the lips of this Elder, both for the sake of his merits and for our own faith. For by His gift believers have often obtained saving counsel from unworthy people, and unbelievers from saints, as the Lord grants this either on account of the merit of those who answer, or on account of the faith of those who ask advice. And so the holy Abbot Germanus caught eagerly at these words as if I had uttered them not of myself but at the prompting of the Lord, and when we had waited a little for the coming of the Elder and the approaching hour of the nocturnal service, after we had welcomed him with the usual greeting and finished reciting the right number of Psalms and prayers, we sat down again as usual on the same mats on which we had settled ourselves to sleep.</p>
