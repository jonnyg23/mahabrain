 <p> <a name="iv.iii.v.xii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.iii.v.xii-p0.1"></a>Chapter XII.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iii.v.xii-p1"></a>That in our spiritual contest we ought to draw an example from the carnal contests.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iii.v.xii-p2"></a>“<span class="sc"><a name="iv.iii.v.xii-p2.1"></a>One</span> who strives in the games is not crowned unless he has contended lawfully.” <a name="fr_833"></a><a href="#fn_833"><font size="1">834</font></a>
  One who wants to extinguish the natural desires of the flesh, should first hasten to overcome those vices whose seat is outside our nature. For if we desire to make trial of the force of the Apostles saying, we ought first to learn what are the laws and what the discipline of the worlds contest, so that finally by a comparison with these, we may be able to know what the blessed Apostle meant to teach to us who are striving in a spiritual contest by this illustration. For in these conflicts, which, as the same Apostle says, hold out “a corruptible crown” <a name="fr_834"></a><a href="#fn_834"><font size="1">835</font></a>
  to the victors, this rule is kept, that he who aims at preparing himself for the crown of glory, which is embellished with the privilege of exemption, and who is anxious to enter the highest struggle in the  <a name="page_238"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 238</font></a> <a name="iv.iii.v.xii-Page_238"></a>contest, should first in the Olympic and Pythian games give evidence of his abilities as a youth, and his strength in its first beginnings; since in these the younger men who want to practise this training are tested as to whether they deserve or ought to be admitted to it, by the judgment both of the president of the games and of the whole multitude. And when any one has been carefully tested, and has first been proved to be stained by no infamy of life, and then has been adjudged not ignoble through the yoke of slavery, and for this reason unworthy to be admitted to this training and to the company of those who practise it, and when thirdly he produces sufficient evidence of his ability and prowess and by striving with the younger men and his own compeers has shown both his skill and valour as a youth, and going forward from the contests of boys has been by the scrutiny of the president permitted to mix with full-grown men and those of approved experience, and has not only shown himself their equal in valour by constant striving with them, but has also many a time carried off the prize of victory among them, then at last he is allowed to approach the most illustrious conflict of the games, permission to contend in which is granted to none but victors and those who are decked with many crowns and prizes. If we understand this illustration from a carnal contest, we ought by a comparison with it to know what is the system and method of our spiritual conflict as well.</p>
