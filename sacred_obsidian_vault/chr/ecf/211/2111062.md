 <p> <a name="iv.vi.viii.ii"></a>  </p><h4 align="center"><a name="iv.vi.viii.ii-p0.1"></a>Chapter II.</h4>  
 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.vi.viii.ii-p1"></a>How the old man exposed our errors.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.vi.viii.ii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.vi.viii.ii-p2.1"></a>The</span> feebleness of your ideas shows that you have not yet renounced worldly desires nor mortified your former lusts. For as the wandering character of your desires testifies to the sloth of your heart, this pilgrimage and absence from your kinsfolk, which you ought rather to endure with your heart, you <i>do</i> endure only with the flesh. For all these things would have been buried and altogether driven out of your hearts, if you had got hold of the right method of renunciation, and the main reason for the solitude in which we dwell. And so I see that you are labouring under that infirmity of sluggishness, which is thus described in Proverbs: “Every sluggard is always desiring something;” and again: “Desires kill the slothful.” <a name="fr_2295"></a><a href="#fn_2295"><font size="1">2296</font></a>
  For in our case too these supplies of worldly conveniences, which you have described, would not be wanting, if we believed that they were appropriate to our calling, or thought that we could get out of those delights and pleasures as much profit as that which is gained from this squalor of the country and bodily affliction. Nor are we so deprived of the solace of our kinsfolk, that those who delight to support us with their substance should fail us, were it not that this saying of the Saviour meets us and excludes everything that contributes to the support of this flesh, as He says: “He who doth not leave (or hate) father and mother and children and brethren cannot be My disciple.” <a name="fr_2296"></a><a href="#fn_2296"><font size="1">2297</font></a>
  But if we were altogether deprived of the protection of our parents, the services of the princes of this world would not be wanting, as they would most thankfully rejoice to minister to our necessities with prompt liberality. And supported by their bounty, we should be free from the care of preparing food, were it not that this curse of the prophet terribly frightened us. For “Cursed,” he says, “is the man that putteth his hope in man;” and: “Put not your trust in princes.” <a name="fr_2297"></a><a href="#fn_2297"><font size="1">2298</font></a>
  We should also at any rate place our cells on the banks of the river Nile and have water at our very doors, so as not to be obliged to carry it on our necks for four miles, were it not that the blessed Apostle rendered us indefatigable in enduring this labour, and cheered us by his words, saying: “Every one shall receive his own reward according to his labour.” <a name="fr_2298"></a><a href="#fn_2298"><font size="1">2299</font></a>
  Nor are we ignorant that there are even in our country some pleasant recesses, where plenty of fruits, and pleasant gardens, and fertile ground would furnish the food we need with the slightest bodily efforts on our part, were it not that we were afraid lest that reproach might apply to us, which is directed against the rich man in the gospel: “Because thou hast received thy consolation in this life.” <a name="fr_2299"></a><a href="#fn_2299"><font size="1">2300</font></a>
  But as we despise all these things and scorn them together with all the pleasures of this world, we delight only in this squalor, and prefer to all luxuries this dreadful and vast desert, and cannot compare any riches of a fertile soil to these  <a name="page_533"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 533</font></a> <a name="iv.vi.viii.ii-Page_533"></a>barren sands, as we pursue no temporal gains of this body, but the eternal rewards of the spirit. For it is but little for a monk to have once made his renunciation, i.e., in the early days of his conversion to have disregarded the present world, unless he continues to renounce it daily. For to the very end of this life we must with the prophet say this: “And I have not desired the day of man, Thou knowest.” <a name="fr_2300"></a><a href="#fn_2300"><font size="1">2301</font></a>
  Wherefore also the Lord says in the gospel: “If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross daily and follow Me.” <a name="fr_2301"></a><a href="#fn_2301"><font size="1">2302</font></a>
