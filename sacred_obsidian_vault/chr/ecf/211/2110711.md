 <p class="subh"><a name="iv.iv.viii.ii-p1"></a>The question of the aforesaid old man on the state of our thoughts.</p>  
 <p class="skip"><a name="iv.iv.viii.ii-p2"></a><span class="sc"><a name="iv.iv.viii.ii-p2.1"></a>This</span> man then in his prayers by day and night, and in fasts and vigils unweariedly entreated for inward chastity of heart and soul, and seeing that he had obtained what he wished and prayed for, and that all the passions of carnal concupiscence in his heart were dead, was roused as it were by the sweetest taste of purity, and inflamed by his zeal for  <a name="page_362"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 362</font></a> <a name="iv.iv.viii.ii-Page_362"></a>chastity towards a yet more ardent desire, and began to apply himself to stricter fasts and prayers that the mortification of this passion which by Gods grace had been granted to his inner man, might be extended also so as to include external purity, to such an extent that he might no longer be affected by any simple and natural movement, such as is excited even in children and infants.

And when with unceasing supplications and tears he was applying himself unweariedly to the petition he had commenced, there came to him an angel in a vision by night, and seemed to open his belly, and to remove from his bowels a sort of fiery fleshly humour, and to cast it away, and restore everything to its place as before; and “lo” he said, “the incitements of your flesh are removed, and you may be sure that you have this day obtained that lasting purity of body for which you have faithfully asked.” It will be enough thus briefly to have told this of the grace of God which was granted to this famous man in a special way. But I deem it unnecessary to say anything of those virtues which he possessed in common with other good men, for fear lest that particular narrative on this mans name might seem to deprive others of that which is specially mentioned of him. Him therefore, as we were inflamed with the greatest eagerness for conference with and instruction from him, we arranged to visit in Lent; and when he had very quietly inquired of us of the character of our thoughts and the state of our inner man, and what help we had got towards its purity from our long stay in the desert, we approached him with these complaints:</p>
