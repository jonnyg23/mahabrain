 <p> <a name="vi.ii.v"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="vi.ii.v-p0.1"></a>Chapter V.—The Opinions of the Philosophers Respecting God.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p1"></a>Let us then run over, if you choose, the opinions of the philosophers, to which they give boastful utterance, respecting the gods; that we may discover philosophy itself, through its conceit making an idol of matter; although we are able to show, as we proceed, that even while deifying certain demons, it has a dream of the truth. The elements were designated as the first principles of all things by some of them: by Thales of Miletus, who celebrated water, and Anaximenes, also of Miletus, who celebrated air as the first principle of all things, and was followed afterwards by Diogenes of Apollonia. Parmenides of Elia introduced fire and earth as gods; one of which, namely fire, Hippasus of Metapontum and Heraclitus of Ephesus supposed a divinity. Empedocles of Agrigentum fell in with a multitude, and, in addition to those four elements, enumerates disagreement and agreement. Atheists surely these are to be reckoned, who through an unwise wisdom worshipped matter, who did not indeed pay religious honour to stocks and stones, but deified earth, the mother of these,—who did not make an image of Poseidon, but revered water itself. For what else, according to the original signification, is Poseidon, but a moist substance? the name being derived from <i>posis</i> (drink); as, beyond doubt, the warlike Ares is so called, from <i>arsis</i> (rising up) and <i>anœresis</i> (destroying). For this reason mainly, I think, many fix a sword into the ground, and sacrifice to it as to Ares. The Scythians have a practice of this nature, as Eudoxus tells us in the second book of his <i>Travels</i>. The Sauromatæ, too, a tribe of the Scythians, worship a sabre, as Ikesius says in his work on <i>Mysteries</i>.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p2"></a>This was also the case with Heraclitus and his followers, who worshipped fire as the first cause; for this fire others named Hephæstus. The Persian Magi, too, and many of the inhabitants of Asia, worshipped fire; and besides them, the Macedonians, as Diogenes relates in the first book of his <i>Persica</i>. Why specify the Sauromatæ, who are said by Nymphodorus, in his <i>Barbaric Customs</i>, to pay sacred honours to fire? or the Persians, or the Medes, or the Magi? These, Dino tells us, sacrifice beneath the open sky, regarding fire and water as the only images of the gods.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p3"></a>Nor have I failed to reveal their ignorance; for, however much they think to keep clear of error in one form, they slide into it in another.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p4"></a>They have not supposed stocks and stones to be images of the gods, like the Greeks; nor ibises and ichneumons, like the Egyptians; but fire and water, as philosophers. Berosus, in the third book of his <i>Chaldaics</i>, shows that it was after many successive periods of years that men worshipped images of human shape, this practice being introduced by Artaxerxes, the son of Darius, and father of Ochus, who first set up the image of Aphrodite Anaitis at Babylon and Susa; and Ecbatana set the example of worshipping it to the Persians; the Bactrians, to Damascus and Sardis.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.ii.v-p5"></a>Let the philosophers, then, own as their teachers the Persians, or the Sauromatæ, or the Magi, from whom they have learned the impious doctrine of regarding as divine certain first principles, being ignorant of the great First Cause, the Maker of all things, and Creator of those very first principles, the unbeginning God, but reverencing “these weak and beggarly elements,” <a name="fr_919"></a><a href="#fn_919"><font size="1">920</font></a>
  as the apostle says, which were made for the service of man. And of the rest of the philosophers who, passing over the elements, have eagerly sought after something higher and nobler, some have discanted on the Infinite, of whom were Anaximander of Miletus, Anaxagoras of Clazomenæ, and the Athenian Archelaus, both of whom set Mind (<span class="Greek"><a name="vi.ii.v-p6.2"></a>νοῦς</span>) above Infinity; while the Milesian Leucippus and the Chian Metrodorus apparently inculcated two first principles—fulness and vacuity. Democritus of Abdera, while accepting these two, added to them images <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.ii.v-p6.3"></a>ει ῎δωλα</span>; while Alcmæon of Crotona supposed the stars to be gods, and endowed with life (I will not keep silence as to their effrontery). Xenocrates of Chalcedon indicates that the planets are seven gods, and that the universe,  <a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 191</font></a> <a name="vi.ii.v-Page_191"></a>composed of all these, is an eighth. Nor will I pass over those of the Porch, who say that the Divinity pervades all matter, even the vilest, and thus clumsily disgrace philosophy. Nor do I think will it be taken ill, having reached this point, to advert to the Peripatetics. The father of this sect, not knowing the Father of all things, thinks that He who is called the Highest is the soul of the universe; that is, he supposes the soul of the world to be God, and so is pierced by his own sword. For by first limiting the sphere of Providence to the orbit of the moon, and then by supposing the universe to be God, he confutes himself, inasmuch as he teaches that that which is without God is God. And that Eresian Theophrastus, the pupil of Aristotle, conjectures at one time heaven, and at another spirit, to be God. Epicurus alone I shall gladly forget, who carries impiety to its full length, and thinks that God takes no charge of the world.  What, moreover, of Heraclides of Pontus? He is dragged everywhere to the images—the <span class="Greek"><a name="vi.ii.v-p6.4"></a>εἴδωλα</span>—of Democritus.</p>
