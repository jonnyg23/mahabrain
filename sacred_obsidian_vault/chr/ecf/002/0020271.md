 <p> <a name="vi.iii.ii.vii"></a> </p><h5 align="center"><a name="vi.iii.ii.vii-p0.1"></a>Chapter VII.—Directions for Those Who Live Together.</h5>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii.vii-p1"></a>Let us keep away from us jibing, the originator of insult, from which strifes and contentions and enmities burst forth. Insult, we have said, is the servant of drunkenness. A man is judged, not from his deeds alone, but from his words. “In a banquet,” it is said, “reprove not thy neighbour, nor say to him a word of reproach.” <a name="fr_1434"></a><a href="#fn_1434"><font size="1">1435</font></a>
  For if we are enjoined especially to associate with saints, it is a sin to jibe at a saint: “For from the mouth of the foolish,” says the Scripture, “is a staff of insult,” <a name="fr_1435"></a><a href="#fn_1435"><font size="1">1436</font></a>
 —meaning by staff the prop of insult, on which insult leans and rests. Whence I admire the apostle, who, in reference to this, exhorts us not to utter “scurrilous nor unsuitable words.” <a name="fr_1436"></a><a href="#fn_1436"><font size="1">1437</font></a>
  For if the assemblies at festivals take place on account of affection, and the end of a banquet is friendliness towards those who meet, and meat and drink accompany affection, how should not conversation be conducted in a rational manner, and puzzling people with questions be avoided from affection? For if we meet together for the purpose of increasing our good-will to each other, why should we stir up enmity by jibing? It is better to be silent than to contradict, and thereby add sin to ignorance. “Blessed,” in truth, “is the man who has not made a slip with his mouth, and has not been pierced by the pain of sin;” <a name="fr_1437"></a><a href="#fn_1437"><font size="1">1438</font></a>
  or has repented of what he has said amiss, or has spoken so as to wound no one. On the whole, let young men and young women altogether keep away from such festivals, that they may not make a slip in respect to what is unsuitable. For things to which their ears are unaccustomed, and unseemly sights, inflame the mind, while faith within them is still wavering; and the instability of their age conspires to make them easily carried away by lust. Sometimes also they are the cause of others stumbling, by  <a name="page_252"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 252</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.ii.vii-Page_252"></a>displaying the dangerous charms of their time of life. For Wisdom appears to enjoin well: “Sit not at all with a married woman, and recline not on the elbow with her;” <a name="fr_1438"></a><a href="#fn_1438"><font size="1">1439</font></a>
  that is, do not sup nor eat with her frequently. Wherefore he adds, “And do not join company with her in wine, lest thy heart incline to her, and by thy blood slide to ruin.” <a name="fr_1439"></a><a href="#fn_1439"><font size="1">1440</font></a>
  For the licence of intoxication is dangerous, and prone to deflower. And he names “a married woman,” because the danger is greater to him who attempts to break the connubial bond.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii.vii-p8"></a>But if any necessity arises, commanding the presence of married women, let them be well clothed—without by raiment, within by modesty. But as for such as are unmarried, it is the extremest scandal for them to be present at a banquet of men, especially men under the influence of wine. And let the men, fixing their eyes on the couch, and leaning without moving on their elbows, be present with their ears alone; and if they sit, let them not have their feet crossed, nor place one thigh on another, nor apply the hand to the chin. For it is vulgar not to bear ones self without support, and consequently a fault in a young man. And perpetually moving and changing ones position is a sign of frivolousness. It is the part of a temperate man also, in eating and drinking, to take a small portion, and deliberately, not eagerly, both at the beginning and during the courses, and to leave off betimes, and so show his indifference. “Eat,” it is said, “like a man what is set before you. Be the first to stop for the sake of regimen; and, if seated in the midst of several people, do not stretch out your hand before them.” <a name="fr_1440"></a><a href="#fn_1440"><font size="1">1441</font></a>
  You must never rush forward under the influence of gluttony; nor must you, though desirous, reach out your hand till some time, inasmuch as by greed one shows an uncontrolled appetite. Nor are you, in the midst of the repast, to exhibit yourselves hugging your food like wild beasts; nor helping yourselves to too much sauce, for man is not by nature a sauce-consumer, but a bread-eater. A temperate man, too, must rise before the general company, and retire quietly from the banquet. “For at the time for rising,” it is said, “be not the last; haste home.” <a name="fr_1441"></a><a href="#fn_1441"><font size="1">1442</font></a>
  The twelve, having called together the multitude of the disciples, said, “It is not meet for us to leave the word of God and serve tables.” <a name="fr_1442"></a><a href="#fn_1442"><font size="1">1443</font></a>
  If they avoided this, much more did they shun gluttony. And the apostles themselves, writing to the brethren at Antioch, and in Syria and Cilicia, said: “It seemed good to the Holy Ghost, and to us, to lay upon you no other burden than these necessary things, to abstain from things offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication, from which, if you keep yourselves, ye shall do well.” <a name="fr_1443"></a><a href="#fn_1443"><font size="1">1444</font></a>
  But we must guard against drunkenness as against hemlock; for both drag down to death. We must also check excessive laughter and immoderate tears.  For often people under the influence of wine, after laughing immoderately, then are, I know not how, by some impulse of intoxication moved to tears; for both effiminacy and violence are discordant with the word. And elderly people, looking on the young as children, may, though but very rarely, be playful with them, joking with them to train them in good behaviour. For example, before a bashful and silent youth, one might by way of pleasantry speak thus: “This son of mine (I mean one who is silent) is perpetually talking.” For a joke such as this enhances the youths modesty, by showing the good qualities that belong to him playfully, by censure of the bad quantities, which do not. For this device is instructive, confirming as it does what is present by what is not present. Such, certainly, is the intention of him who says that a water-drinker and a sober man gets intoxicated and drunk. But if there are those who like to jest at people, we must be silent, and dispense with superfluous words like full cups. For such sport is dangerous. “The mouth of the impetuous approaches to contrition.” <a name="fr_1444"></a><a href="#fn_1444"><font size="1">1445</font></a>
  “Thou shalt not receive a foolish report, nor shall thou agree with an unjust person to be an unjust witness,” <a name="fr_1445"></a><a href="#fn_1445"><font size="1">1446</font></a>
  neither in calumnies nor in injurious speeches, much less evil practices. I also should think it right to impose a limit on the speech of rightly regulated persons, who are impelled to speak to one who maintains a conversation with them. “For silence is the excellence of women, and the safe prize of the young; but good speech is characteristic of experienced, mature age. Speak, old man, at a banquet, for it is becoming to you.  But speak without embarrassment, and with accuracy of knowledge. Youth, Wisdom also commands thee. Speak, if you must, with hesitation, on being twice asked; sum up your discourse in a few words.” <a name="fr_1446"></a><a href="#fn_1446"><font size="1">1447</font></a>
  But let both speakers regulate their discourse according to just proportion. For loudness of utterance is most insane; while an inaudible utterance is characteristic of a senseless man, for people will not hear: the one is the mark of pusillanimity, the other of arrogance. Let contentiousness in words, for the sake of a useless triumph, be banished; for our aim is to be free from perturbation.  <a name="page_253"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 253</font></a> <a name="vi.iii.ii.vii-Page_253"></a>Such is the meaning of the phrase, <a name="fr_1447"></a><a href="#fn_1447"><font size="1">1448</font></a>
  “Peace to thee.” Answer not a word before you hear. An enervated voice is the sign of effeminacy. But modulation in the voice is characteristic of a wise man, who keeps his utterance from loudness, from drawling, from rapidity, from prolixity. For we ought not to speak long or much, nor ought we to speak frivolously. Nor must we converse rapidly and rashly. For the voice itself, so to speak, ought to receive its just dues; and those who are vociferous and clamorous ought to be silenced. For this reason, the wise Ulysses chastised Thersites with stripes:—</p>  <blockquote><a name="vi.iii.ii.vii-p16.2"></a> “Only Thersites, with unmeasured words,<br>  Of which he had good store, to rate the chiefs,<br>  Not over-seemly, but wherewith he thought<br>  To move the crowd to laughter, brawled aloud.” <a name="fr_1448"></a><a href="#fn_1448"><font size="1">1449</font></a>
 <br>  </blockquote>  
 <p class="continue"><a name="vi.iii.ii.vii-p18"></a>“For dreadful in his destruction is a loquacious man.” <a name="fr_1449"></a><a href="#fn_1449"><font size="1">1450</font></a>
  And it is with triflers as with old shoes: all the rest is worn away by evil; the tongue only is left for destruction. Wherefore Wisdom gives these most useful exhortations: “Do not talk trifles in the multitude of the elders.” Further, eradicating frivolousness, beginning with God, it lays down the law for our regulation somewhat thus: “Do not repeat your words in your prayer.” <a name="fr_1450"></a><a href="#fn_1450"><font size="1">1451</font></a>
  Chirruping and whistling, and sounds made through the fingers, by which domestics are called, being irrational signs, are to be given up by rational men. Frequent spitting, too, and violent clearing of the throat, and wiping ones nose at an entertainment, are to be shunned. For respect is assuredly to be had to the guests, lest they turn in disgust from such filthiness, which argues want of restraint. For we are not to copy oxen and asses, whose manger and dunghill are together. For many wipe their noses and spit even whilst supping.</p>  
 <p><a name="vi.iii.ii.vii-p21"></a>If any one is attacked with sneezing, just as in the case of hiccup, he must not startle those near him with the explosion, and so give proof of his bad breeding; but the hiccup is to be quietly transmitted with the expiration of the breath, the mouth being composed becomingly, and not gaping and yawning like the tragic masks. So the disturbance of hiccup may be avoided by making the respirations gently; for thus the threatening symptoms of the ball of wind will be dissipated in the most seemly way, by managing its egress so as also to conceal anything which the air forcibly expelled may bring up with it. To wish to add to the noises, instead of diminishing them, is the sign of arrogance and disorderliness. Those, too, who scrape their teeth, bleeding the wounds, are disagreeable to themselves and detestable to their neighbours. Scratching the ears and the irritation of sneezing are swinish itchings, and attend unbridled fornication. Both shameful sights and shameful conversation about them are to be shunned. Let the look be steady, and the turning and movement of the neck, and the motions of the hands in conversation, be decorous. In a word, the Christian is characterized by composure, tranquillity, calmness, and peace. <a name="fr_1451"></a><a href="#fn_1451"><font size="1">1452</font></a>
