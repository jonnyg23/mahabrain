 <p><a name="iii.v.vi.xxiv-p5"></a>How great is our grief, and how great the affliction of our heart, from what has taken place in the regions of Campania we cannot express; but thou mayest thyself gather it from the greatness of the calamity.  With regard to this state of things, we send thy Experience by the magnificent Stephen, bearer of these presents, money for the succour of the captives who have been taken, admonishing thee that thou give thy whole attention to the business, and carry it out strenuously; and, in the case of freemen whom thou knowest to have no sufficient means for their own redemption, that thou make haste to redeem them.  But, should there be any slaves, and thou findest that their masters are so poor that they cannot come forward to redeem them, hesitate not to recover them also.  In like manner also thou wilt take care to redeem the slaves of the Church who have been lost by thy neglect.  Further, whomsoever thou shalt have redeemed, thou wilt by all means be at pains to make out a list, containing their names, and a statement of where each is staying, and what he is doing, and where he came from; which list thou mayest bring with thee when thou comest.  Moreover, hasten to shew thyself so diligent in this business that those who are to be redeemed may incur no risk through thy negligence, or thou come afterwards to be highly culpable before us.  But work especially for this also; that, if possible, thou mayest be able to recover those captives at a moderate price.  But set down in writing, with all clearness and nicety, the whole sum expended, and transmit to us this thy written account with speed.  The month of May, Indiction 14.</p>
