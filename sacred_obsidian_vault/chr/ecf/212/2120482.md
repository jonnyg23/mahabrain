 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p1.1"></a>Epistle LV.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p2"></a>To King Childebert.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p3"></a>Gregory to Childebert, king of the Franks <a name="fr_1620"></a><a href="#fn_1620"><font size="1">1621</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p5"></a>The letter of your Excellency has made us exceedingly glad, testifying as it does that you are careful, with pious affection, of the honour and reverence due to priests.  For you thus shew to all that you are faithful worshippers of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p5.1"></a>God</span>, while you love His priests with the acceptable veneration that is due to them, and hasten with Christian devotion to do whatever may advance their position.  Whence also we have received with pleasure what you have written, and grant what you desire with willing mind; and accordingly we have committed, with the favour of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p5.2"></a>God</span>, our vicariate jurisdiction to our brother Virgilius, bishop of the city of Arelate, according to ancient custom and your Excellencys desire; and have also granted him the use of the pallium, as has been the custom of old.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p6"></a>But, inasmuch as some things have been reported to us which greatly offend Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p6.1"></a>God</span>, and confound the honour and reverence due to the priesthood, we beg that they may be in every way amended with the support of the censure of your power, lest, while headstrong and perverse doings run counter to your devotion, your kingdom, or your soul (which <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p6.2"></a>God</span> forbid) be burdened by the guilt of others.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p7"></a>Further, it has come to our knowledge that on the death of bishops some persons from being laymen are tonsured, and mount to the episcopate by a sudden leap.  And thus one   <a name="page_185b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 185b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-Page_185b"></a>who has not been a disciple is in his inconsiderate ambition made a master.  And, since he has not learned what to teach, he bears the office of priesthood only in name; for he continues to be a layman in speech and action as before.  How, then, is he to intercede for the sins of others, not having in the first place bewailed his own?  For such a shepherd does not defend, but deceives, the flock; since, while he cannot for very shame try to persuade others to do what he does not do himself, what else is it but that the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p7.1"></a>Lords</span> people remains a prey to robbers, and catches destruction from the source whence it ought to have had a great support of wholesome protection?  How bad and how perverse a proceeding this is let your Excellencys Highness consider even from your own administration of things.  For it is certain that you do not put a leader over an army unless his work and his fidelity have first been apparent; unless the virtue and industry of his previous life have shewn him to be a fit person.  But, if the command of an army is not committed to any but men of this kind, it is easily gathered from this comparison of what sort a leader of souls ought to be.  But it is a reproach to us, and we are ashamed to say it, that priests snatch at leadership who have not seen the very beginning of religious warfare.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p8"></a>But this also, a thing most execrable, has been reported to us as well:  that sacred orders are conferred through simoniacal heresy, that is for bribes received.  And, seeing that it is exceedingly pestiferous, and contrary to the Universal Church, that one be promoted to any sacred order not for merit but for a price, we exhort your Excellency to order so detestable a wickedness to be banished from your kingdom.  For that man shows himself to be thoroughly unworthy of this office, who fears not to buy the gift of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p8.1"></a>God</span> with money, and presumes to try to get by payment what he deserves not to have through grace.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p9"></a>These things, then, most excellent son, I admonish you about for this reason, that I desire your soul to be saved.  And I should have written about them before now, had not innumerable occupations stood in the way of my will.  But now that a suitable time for answering your letter has offered itself, I have not omitted what it was my duty to do.  Wherefore, greeting your Excellency with the affection of paternal charity, we beg that all things which we have enjoined on our above-named brother and fellow-bishop to be done and observed, may be carried out under the protection of your favour, and that you allow them not to be in any way upset by the elation or pride of any one.  But, as they were observed by his predecessor under the reign of your glorious father, so let them be observed now also, by your aid, with zealous devotion.  It is right, then, that we should thus have a return made to us; and that, as we have not deferred fulfilling your will, so you too, for the sake of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p9.1"></a>God</span> and the blessed Peter, Prince of the apostles, should cause our ordinances to be observed in all respects; that so your Excellencys reputation, praiseworthy and well-pleasing to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.xxviii-p9.2"></a>God</span>, may extend itself all around.  Given the 12th day of August, Indiction 13.</p>
