 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p2"></a>To Dominicus, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p3"></a>Gregory to Dominicus, Bishop of Carthage <a name="fr_1453"></a><a href="#fn_1453"><font size="1">1454</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p5"></a>We have received with the utmost gratification the letters of your Fraternity, which have reached us somewhat late by the hands of Donatus and Quodvultdeus, our most reverend brethren and fellow-bishops, and also Victor the deacon with Agilegius the notary.  And though we thought that we had suffered loss from the tardiness of their coming, yet we find gain from their more abundant charity; seeing that from this delay in point of time there appears no interruption, but rather increase of the love which, by the mercy of <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p5.1"></a>God</span>, through your contemplation of the priestly office, your practice of reading, and your maturity of age, we know to be already firmly planted in you.  For it would not flow so largely from you, had it not very many most abundant veins in your heart.  Let us, therefore, most holy brother, hold fast with unshaken firmness this mother and guard of virtues.  Let not the tongues of the deceitful  <a name="page_115b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-Page_115b"></a>diminish it in us, or any snares of the ancient enemy corrupt it.  For this joins what is divided, and keeps together what is joined.  This lifts up what is lowly without tumour; this brings down what is lifted up without dejection.  Through this the unity of the universal Church, which is the knitting together of the Body of Christ, rejoices in its several parts through the minds equalization of them, though having in it dissimilarity from the diversity of its members.  Through this these members both exult in the joy of others, though in themselves afflicted, and also droop for the sorrows of others, though in themselves joyful.  For seeing that, as the teacher of the Gentiles testifies, if one member suffers anything, the other members suffer with it, and if one member glories, all the members rejoice with it, I doubt not that you groan for our perturbation, as it is quite certain that we rejoice for your peace.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p6"></a>Now as to your Fraternity rejoicing with us on our ordination, it displays to me the affection of most sincere charity.  But I confess that a force of sorrow strikes through my soul from contemplation of this order of ministry.  For heavy is the weight of priesthood; seeing that it is necessary for a priest, first to live so as to be an example to others, and then to be on his guard not to lift up his heart because of the example which he shews.  He should ever be thinking of the ministry of preaching, considering with most intense fear how that the <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p6.1"></a>Lord</span>, when about to depart to receive for Himself a kingdom, and giving talents to His servants, says, <i>Trade ye till I come</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk019.htm#013">Luke xix. 13</a><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p6.2"></a>).  Which trading surely we carry on only if by our living and our speaking we win the souls of our neighbours; if by preaching the joys of the heavenly kingdom we strengthen all that are weak in divine love; if by terribly sounding forth the punishments of hell we bend the froward and the timid; if we spare no one against the truth; if, given to heavenly friendships, we fear not human enmities.  And indeed it was in thus shewing himself that the Psalmist knew that he had offered a kind of Sacrifice to <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p6.3"></a>God</span>, when he said, <i>Did I not hate them, O <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p6.4"></a>God</span>, that hated thee, and was I not grieved with thine enemies!  Yea I hated them with a perfect hated, and they became enemies unto me</i> (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa139.htm#021">Psa. 139.21</a><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p6.5"></a> <a name="fr_1454"></a><a href="#fn_1454"><font size="1">1455</font></a>
 ).  But in view of this burden I tremble for my infirmity, and look to the returning of the Master of the house, after receiving His kingdom, to take account of us.  But with what heart shall I bear His coming, if from the trading I undertook I render Him no gain, or almost none?  Do thou, therefore, most dear brother, help me with thy prayers; and what thou seest me to fear for myself, consider daily on thine own account with anxious dread.  For through the bond of charity both what I say of myself is thy concern, and what I desire thee to do is mine.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p8"></a>Further, as to what your Fraternity writes about ecclesiastical privileges, keep to this without any hesitation, since, as we defend our own rights, so we observe those of several churches.  Nor do I through partiality grant to any Church whatever more than it deserves, nor do I under the instigation of ambition derogate from any what belongs to it by right; but I desire to honour my brethren in all ways, and study accordingly that each may be advanced in honour, so long as there can be no opposition to it of right on the part of one against the other.  Further, I greatly rejoice with you in the manners of your messengers, in whom it has been shewn me how much you love me, in that you have sent to me elect brethren and sons.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.ii.xxv-p4"></a> The bishop of Carthage was primate of the province of Africa Proconsularis in virtue of his See.  For the custom with regard to primacy in other African provinces, see I. 74, note 2.  The fact, apparent from this letter, that Dominicus had deemed sending to Gregory on his accession the congratulatory letter that had been expected, and Gregorys carefulness to assure him, in the course of the studiously courteous letter, of his desire to respect the ancient privileges of Churches, may be among the symptoms, otherwise apparent, of the authoritative claims of the Roman See being still viewed with some jealousy in the African Church.  Cf. in Book VIII. Epistle 33, to the same Dominicus, in which Gregory, in praising his reverence for the Apostolic See, attributes such reverence to his knowledge of the origin of the African episcopacy, refraining from asserting in this case any prerogative of divine right belonging to the See of S. Peter.  Other letters to Dominicus are V. 5; VII. 35; XII. 1.</p>
