 <p> <a name="iii.v.v.vi"></a>
 </p><p class="c27"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p1"></a> <span class="c1"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p1.1"></a>Epistle XV.</span></p>  
 <p class="c30"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p2"></a>To John, Bishop.</p>  
 <p class="c18"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p3"></a>Gregory to John, Bishop of Ravenna.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p4"></a>In the first place this makes me sad; that thy Fraternity writes to me with a double heart, exhibiting one sort of blandishment in letters, but another sort with the tongue in secular intercourse.  In the next place, it grieves me that my brother John even to this day retains on his tongue those gibes which notaries while still boys are wont to indulge in.  He speaks bitingly, and seems to delight in such pleasantry.  He flatters his friends in their presence, and maligns them in their absence.  Thirdly, it is to me grievous and altogether execrable, that   <a name="page_165b"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 165b</font></a> <a name="iii.v.v.vi-Page_165b"></a>he imputes shameful crimes to his servants <a name="fr_1580"></a><a href="#fn_1580"><font size="1">1581</font></a>
 , whatever the hour may be, calling them “effeminate;” and, what is still more grievous, this is done openly.  Then there is this in addition that there is no discipline for keeping guard over the life of the clergy, but that he exhibits himself only as their lord.  The last thing, but first in importance as evidence of elation, is about his use of the pallium outside the church, which is a thing he never presumed to do in the times of my predecessors, and what none of his predecessors ever presumed to do, as our delegates testify (except it might be when relics were deposited, though with regard to relics one person only could be found to say that it was so); yet this in my days, in contempt of me, with extreme audacity, he not only did, but even made a habit of doing.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p6"></a>From all these things I find that the dignity of the Episcopacy is with him all in outside show, not in his mind.  And indeed I return thanks to Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p6.1"></a>God</span> that at the time when this came to my knowledge, which had never reached the ears of my predecessors, the Lombards were posted between me and the city of Ravenna.  For perchance I had it in my mind to shew to men how severe I can be <a name="fr_1581"></a><a href="#fn_1581"><font size="1">1582</font></a>
 .</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p8"></a>Lest, however, thou shouldest suppose that I wish thy church to be depressed or lessened in dignity, remember where the deacon of Ravenna used to stand in solemnization of mass at Rome, and enquire where he stands now; and thou wilt recognize the fact that I desire to honour the church of Ravenna.  But that any one whatever should snatch at anything out of pride, this I cannot tolerate.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p9"></a>Nevertheless I have already written on this matter to our deacon at Constantinople, that he should enquire of all who have under them even thirty or forty bishops.  And if there is anywhere this custom of their walking in litanies wearing the pallium, <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p9.1"></a>God</span> forbid that through me the dignity of the church of Ravenna should seem to be in any way lessened.</p>  
 <p><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p10"></a>Reflect, therefore, dearest brother, on all that I have said above:  think of the day of thy call:  consider what account thou wilt render of the burden of episcopacy.  Amend those manners of a notary.  See what becomes a bishop in tongue and in deed.  Be entirely sincere to thy brethren.  Do not speak one thing, and have another in thy heart.  Do not desire to seem more than thou art, that so thou mayest be able to be more than thou seemest.  Believe me, when I came to my present position, I had such consideration and charity towards thee that, if thou hadst wished to keep hold of this my charity, thou still wouldest not have ever found such a brother as myself, or one so sincerely loving thee, or so concurring with thee in all devotion:  but when I came to know of thy words and thy manners, I confess I started back.  I beseech thee, then, by Almighty <span class="sc"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p10.1"></a>God</span>, amend all that I have spoken of, and especially the vice of duplicity.  Allow me to love thee; and for the present and the future life it may be of advantage to thee to be loved of thy brethren.  Reply, however, to all this, not by words, but by behaviour.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p5"></a> “Servis tuis turpia crimina imponis,”—apparently meaning that at all hours he was accustomed to call them by opprobrious names.</p>

 <p class="endnote"><a name="iii.v.v.vi-p7"></a> The meaning may be, “I am thankful now that the fact of communication between Rome and Ravenna being blocked by the Lombards when the matter first reached my ears prevented my acting so peremptorily as I might then have been disposed to do.”</p>
