  in respect of the cause which I am now pleading, that whatsoever I may be found to be, yet the Church for which I speak unconquered.</p>

Crit</i>. pp. 326-328) suggests as an improvement. <i>"Ubi vobis faventibus loquatur et victus.  Verum si millies tantum talia vel etiam sceleratiora dicat in me, mihi sat est"</i>, etc.,— "on which he may speak amidst applause from you, even when beaten.  But if he were to make a thousand times as many  statements concerning me," etc.</p>
