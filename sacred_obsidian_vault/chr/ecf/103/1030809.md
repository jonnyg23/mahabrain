 </p><p class="c10"><a name="v.ix.vii-p1"></a>  6. If this be true, doubtless also the providing for the interment of bodies a place at <a name="page_542"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 542</font></a> <a name="v.ix.vii-Page_542"></a>the Memorials of Saints, is a mark of a good human affection towards the remains of ones friends: since if there be religion in the burying, there cannot but be religion in taking thought where the burying shall be. But while it is desirable there should be such like solaces of survivors, for the showing forth of their pious mind towards their beloved, I do not see what helps they be to the dead save in this way: that upon recollection of the place in which are deposited the bodies of those whom they love, they should by prayer commend them to those same Saints, who have as patrons taken them into their charge to aid them before the Lord. Which indeed they would be still able to do, even though they were not able to inter them in such places. But then the only reason why the name Memorials or Monuments is given to those sepulchres of the dead which become specially distinguished, is that they recall to memory, and by putting in mind cause us to think of, them who by death are withdrawn from the eyes of the living, that they may not by forgetfulness be also withdrawn from mens hearts. For both the term Memorial <a name="fr_2725"></a><a href="#fn_2725"><font size="1">2726</font></a>
  most plainly shews this, and Monument is so named from monishing, that is, putting in mind. For which reason the Greeks also call that <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix.vii-p2.1"></a>μνημεῖον</span> which we call a Memorial or Monument: because in their tongue the memory itself, by which we remember, is called <span class="Greek"><a name="v.ix.vii-p2.2"></a>μνήμη</span>. When therefore the mind recollects where the body of a very dear friend lies buried, and thereupon there occurs to the thoughts a place rendered venerable by the name of a Martyr, to that same Martyr doth it commend the soul in affection of heartfelt recollection <a name="fr_2726"></a><a href="#fn_2726"><font size="1">2727</font></a>
  and prayer. And when this affection is exhibited to the departed by faithful men who were most dear to them, there is no doubt that it profits them who while living in the body merited that such things should profit them after this life. But even if some necessity should through absence of all facility not allow bodies to be interred, or in such places interred, yet should there be no pretermitting of supplications for the spirits of the dead: which supplications, that they should be made for all in Christian and catholic fellowship departed, even without mentioning of their names, under a general commemoration, the Church hath charged herself withal; to the intent that they which lack, for these offices, parents or sons or whatever kindred or friends, may have the same afforded unto them by the one pious mother which is common to all. But if there were lack of these supplications, which are made with right faith and piety for the dead, I account that it should not a whit profit their spirits, howsoever in holy places the lifeless bodies should be deposited.</p>
