 <p>   A CHILD was planted out of the height, a mystery revealed in Jerusalem.<a name="page_35_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_35_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> The priests saw dreams; chill seized on their children, chill seized on Jerusalem.</p>
 
 <p>   Early in the morning he<a name="page_35_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_35_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> went to the temple. He opened his mouth in blasphemy and his lips of lying. He opened his mouth in blasphemy and spake to all of the priests:</p>
 
 <p>   "In my vision of the night I beheld, [I beheld] in my vision. When I lay there, I slept not and rested not, and sleep came not to me by night. I slept not and rested not, [and I beheld] that a star appeared and stood over Enishbai.<a name="page_35_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_35_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> Fire burned in Old Father (Abā Sābā) Zakhriā;<a name="page_35_fr_5"></a><a href="#page_35_note_5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a> three heaven-lights appeared.<a name="page_35_fr_6"></a><a href="#page_35_note_6"><sup><small>6</small></sup></a> The

 sun sank and the lights rose. Fire lit up the house of the people (synagogue), smoke rose over the temple. A quaking quaked in the Throne-chariot,<a name="page_36_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_36_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> so that Earth removed from her seat. A star flew down into Judæa, a star flew down into Jerusalem. The sun appeared by night, and the moon rose by day."</p>
 
 <p>   When the priests heard this, they cast dust on their head. Yaqif the priest weeps and Beni-Amin's tears flow.<a name="page_36_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_36_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> Shilai and Shalbai<a name="page_36_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_36_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> cast dust on their heads. Elizar<a name="page_36_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_36_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> [the chief priest] opened his mouth and spake unto all of the priests: "Yaqif interprets dreams, but as yet he has no understanding of these.

 secrets? Ṭāb-Yōmīn<a name="page_37_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_37_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> gives us no revelation, though you deem he can give information on all that is and [that] is not.</p>
 
 <p>   Earth groans out of season and is sent a-whirl through the heaven-spheres. Earth<a name="page_37_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_37_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> opens her mouth and speaks to Elizar: "Go to Lilyukh,<a name="page_37_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_37_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> that he may interpret the dreams you have seen," Thereon Elizar opened his mouth and spake unto all of the priests: "Who goes to Lilyukh, that he may interpret the dreams you have seen?" Then wrote they a letter and put it in the hand of Ṭāb-Yōmīn. Ṭāb-Yōmīn took the letter and betook himself to Lilyukh, Lilyukh lay on his bed; sleep had not yet flown from him. A quaking came into his heart, shivered his heart and brought it down from its stay, Ṭāb-Yōmīn drew near to Lilyukh, Ṭāb-Yōmīn stepped up to Lilyukh, shook him out of his sleep and spake to him: "The priests saw dreams, . . . [the above paragraph is repeated verbally down to] . . . and the moon rose by day."</p>
 
 <p>   When Lilyukh heard this, he cast dust on his head. Naked, Lilyukh rose from his bed and fetched the dream-book. He opens it and reads in it and looks for what stands there written. He opens it and reads therein and interprets the dreams in silence without reading aloud. He writes them in a letter and expounds them on a leaf. In it he says to them: "Woe unto you, all of you priests, for Enishbai shall bear a child. Woe unto you, ye rabbis, for a child shall be born in Jerusalem. Woe unto you, ye teachers and pupils, for Enishbai shall bear a child, woe unto you, Mistress Torah (the Law), for Yōhānā shall be born in Jerusalem."</p>
 
 <p>   Lilyukh writes unto them in the letter and says to them: "The star, that came and stood over Enishbai: A child will be planted out of the height from above; he comes and will be given unto Enishbai. The fire, that burned in Old Father Zakhriā: Yōhānā will be born in Jerusalem."</p>
 
 <p>   Ṭāb-Yōmīn took the letter and in haste made off to Jerusalem.

 He came and found all the priests sitting in sorrow. He took the letter and laid it in the hand of Elizar. He (E.) opens it and reads it and finds in it wondrous discourses. He opens it and reads it and sees what stands therein written. He reads it in silence and gives them no decision about it. Elizar then took it and laid it in the hand of Old Father Zakhriā. He (Z.) opens it and reads it and sees what stands therein written. He reads it in silence and gives no decision about it. Elizar now opened his mouth and spake to Old Father Zakhriā: "Old Father, get thee gone from Judæa, lest thou stir up strife in Jerusalem." Old Father then raised his right hand and smote on the head Elizar: "Elizar, thou great house, thou head of all the priests! If thou in thy inner [part] knewest thy mother, thou wouldst not dare come into our synagogue. If thou in thy inner [part] knewest, thou wouldst not dare read the Torah. For thy mother was a wanton.<a name="page_38_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_38_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> A wanton was she, who did not match with the house of her husband's father. As thy father had not the hundred gold staters for writing her the bill of divorcement, he abandoned her straightway and enquired not for her. Is there a day when I come and look forth,<a name="page_38_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_38_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> and see not Mīshā bar Amrā?<a name="page_38_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_38_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> Yea, is there a day when I come without praying in your synagogue, that you (pl.) should be false and dishonest and say a word which you have ne'er heard about me? Where is there a dead man who becomes living again, that Enishbai should bear a child? Where is there a blind man who becomes seeing, where is there a lame man for whom his feet [walk again], and where is there a mute who learns [to read in] a book, that Enishbai should bear a child? It is two and twenty years<a name="page_38_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_38_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> to-day that I have seen no wife. Nay, neither through me nor through you will Enishbai bear a child."</p>
 
 <p>   Then all of the priests arose and said to Old Father Zakhriā, [they said] in reproach: "Be at rest and keep thy seat, Old Father, and let the calm of the Good (pl.) rest upon thee. Old

 Father, if there were no dreams in Judæa, then would all that Mīshā has said, be lying. Rather shall thy word and our word be made good, and the dreams we have seen. Yōhānā will receive Jordan and be called prophet in Jerusalem."</p>
 
 <p>   Thereon Old Father removed himself from their midst, and Elizar followed him. Then were seen three lights (lit. lamps) which companied with him (Z.). They (the priests) ran up, caught Old Father by the hem of his robe and said to him: "Old Father, what is 't that goes before thee, and what is 't that follows thee?" Then answered he them: "O Elizar, thou great house, thou head of all of the priests, I know not whom the lights guard which go before me. I know not with whom the fire goes which follows me. [But] neither through me nor through you will Enishbai bear a child."</p>
 
 <p>   Then all the priests rose and said to Old Father Zakhriā, [they said] in reproach: "Old Father Zakhriā, be at peace, firm and decided, for the child will be planted from out of the most high height and be given to thee in thy old age. Yōhānā will be born, Yōhānā will receive Jordan and be called prophet in Jerusalem. We will be baptized with his baptizing and with his pure sign [will we] be signed. We will take his bread and drink his drink and with him ascend to Light's region."</p>
 
 <p>   All the priests arose and said to Old Father Zakhriā, [they said] in reproach: "Old Father! We will enlighten thee as to thy race<a name="page_39_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_39_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> and thy fathers, from whom thou hast come forth. . . . [there follows a list of prophets and sages, beginning with Moses, which I omit, as it requires a lengthy commentary for which space here does not serve,—ending with]. . . Ṭāb-Yōmīn and the school-teachers have come forth from thy race. The blessed princes, who are thy forbears, Old Father, all of them have taken no wife and begotten no sons.<a name="page_39_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_39_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> Yet in their old age<a name="page_39_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_39_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> each of them

 had a son.<a name="page_40_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_40_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> They had sons, and they were prophets in Jerusalem. If now out of thee as well a prophet comes forth, thou dost then revive this race again. Yea, Yōhānā will be born and will be called prophet in Jerusalem."</p>
 
 <p>   Then Elizar opened his mouth and said to Old Father: "Old Father! If Yōhānā receives Jordan, then will I be his servant, be baptized with his baptizing and signed with his pure sign. We will take his bread and drink his drink and with him ascend to Light's region." Then Old Father opened his mouth and said unto all of the priests: "If the child comes out of the most high height, what then will you do in Jerusalem?"</p>
 
 <p>   They<a name="page_40_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_40_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> have taken the child out of the basin of Jordan and laid him in the womb of Enishbai.</p>

 whose praise dost thou make proclamation?" Thereon I gave to them answer: "I stand in the strength of my Father and with the praise of the Man, my creator. I have built no house in Judæa, have set up no throne in Jerusalem. I have not loved the wreath of the roses, not commerce with lovely women. I have not loved the defective,<a name="page_41_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_41_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> not loved the cup of the drunkards. I have loved no food of the body, and envy has found no place in me. I have not forgotten my night-prayer, not forgotten wondrous Jordan. I have not forgotten my baptizing, not [forgotten] my pure sign. I have not forgotten Sun-day,<a name="page_41_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_41_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> and the Day's evening has not condemned me. I have not forgotten Shilmai and Nibdai,<a name="page_41_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_41_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> who dwell in the House of the Mighty.<a name="page_41_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_41_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> They clear me and let me ascend; they know no fault, no defect is in me."</p>
 
 <p>   When Yahyā said this, Life rejoiced over him greatly. The Seven sent him their greeting and the Twelve<a name="page_41_fr_5"></a><a href="#page_41_note_5"><sup><small>5</small></sup></a> made obeisance before him. They said to him: "Of all these words which thou hast spoken, thou hast not said a single one falsely. Delightful and fair is thy voice, and none is an equal to thee.

 <p>   Yaqif leaves the house of the people, Beni-Amin leaves the temple, Elizar, the great house, leaves the dome of the priests. The priests spake unto Yahyā in Jerusalem: "Yahyā, go forth from our city! Before thy voice quaked the house of the people, at the sound of thy proclamations the temple did quake, at the sound of thy discourse quaked the priests' dome." Thereon Yahyā answered the priests in Jerusalem: "Bring fire and burn me; bring sword and hew me in pieces." But the priests in Jerusalem answered to Yahyā: "Fire does not burn thee, O Yahyā, for Life's Name has been uttered o'er thee.

 <p>   YAHYĀ proclaims in the nights.—Glory rises over the worlds.</p>
 
 <p>   Who told Yeshu (Eshu)? Who told Yeshu Messiah, son of Miryam, who told Yeshu, so that he went to the shore of the Jordan and said [unto Yahyā]: "Yahyā, baptize me with thy baptizing and utter o'er me also the Name thy wont is to utter. If I show myself as thy pupil, I will remember thee then in my writing;
 
 <!------------------------page 49------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a>
 
 I attest not myself as thy pupil, then wipe out my name from thy page,"</p>
 
 <p>   Thereon Yahyā answered Yeshu Messiah in Jerusalem: "Thou hast lied to the Jews and deceived the priests. Thou hast cut off their seed from the men and from the women bearing and being pregnant. The sabbath, which Moses made binding, hast thou relaxed<a name="page_49_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_49_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> in Jerusalem. Thou hast lied unto them with horns<a name="page_49_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_49_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> and spread abroad disgrace with the shofar."</p>
 
 <p>   Thereon Yeshu Messiah answered Yahyā in Jerusalem: "If I have lied to the Jews, may the blazing fire consume me. If I have deceived the priests, a double death will I die. If I have cut off their seed from the men, may I not cross o'er the End-Sea. If I have cut off from the women birth and being pregnant, then is in sooth a judge raised up before me. If I have relaxed the sabbath, may the blazing fire consume me. If I have lied to the Jews, I will tread on thorns and thistles. If I have spread disgrace abroad with horn-blowing, may my eyes then not light on Abathur.<a name="page_49_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_49_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> So baptize me then with thy baptizing, and utter o'er me the Name thy wont is to utter. If I show myself as thy pupil, I will remember thee then in my writing; if I attest not myself as thy pupil, then wipe out my name from thy page."</p>
 
 <p>   Then spake Yahyā to Yeshu Messiah in Jerusalem: "A stammerer becomes not a scholar, a blind man writes no letter. A desolate house<a name="page_49_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_49_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> mounts not to the height, and a widow becomes not a virgin. Foul water becomes not tasty, and a stone does not with oil soften."</p>
 
 <p>   Thereon Yeshu Messiah made answer to Yahyā in Jerusalem: "A stammerer a scholar becomes, a blind man writes a letter. A desolate house mounts unto the height, and a widow becomes a virgin. Foul water becomes tasty, and a stone with oil softens."</p>
 
 <p>   Thereon spake Yahyā unto Yeshu Messiah in Jerusalem: "If
 
 <!------------------------page 50------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a>
 
 thou givest me illustration for this, thou art [really] a wise Messiah."</p>
 
 <p>   Thereon Yeshu Messiah made answer to Yahyā in Jerusaem: "A stammerer a scholar becomes: a child who comes from the bearer, blooms and grows big. Through wages and alms he comes on high; he comes on high through wages and alms, and ascends and beholds the Light's region.</p>
 
 <p>   "A blind man who writes a letter: a villain who has become virtuous. He abandoned wantonness and abandoned theft and reached unto faith in almighty Life.</p>
 
 <p>   "A desolate house who ascends again to the height: one of position who has become humble. He quitted his palaces and quitted his pride and built a house on the sea [-shore]. A house he built on the sea [-shore], and into it opened two doors, so that he might bring in unto him whoever lay down there in misery,—to him he opened the door and took him within to himself. If he would eat, he laid for him a table with Truth, If he would drink, he mixed for him [wine-] cups [with Truth], If he would lie down, he spread a bed for him in Truth. If he would depart, he led him forth on the way of Truth. He led him forth on the way of Truth and of faith, and then he ascends and beholds the Light's region.</p>
 
 <p>   "A widow who a virgin becomes: a woman who already in youth has been widowed. She kept her shame closed, and sat there till her children were grown.<a name="page_50_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_50_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> If she passes over, her face does not pale in her husband's<a name="page_50_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_50_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> presence.</p>
 
 <p>   "Foul water that is made tasty: a girl wanton who has got back her honour: she went up a hamlet and she went down a hamlet without taking her veil from her face.</p>
 
 <p>   "A stone with oil softens: a heretic who has come down from the mountain.<a name="page_50_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_50_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> He abandoned magic and sorcery and made

 confession to almighty Life. He found a fatherless and filled him full and filled full the widow's pockets.</p>
 
 <p>   "Therefor baptize me, O Yahyā, with thy baptizing and utter o'er me the Name thy wont is to utter. If I show myself as thy pupil, I will remember thee in my writing; if I attest not myself as thy pupil, then wipe out my name from thy page. Thou wilt for thy sins be haled to account, and I for my sins will be haled to account."</p>
 
 <p>   When Yeshu Messiah said this, there came a Letter out of the House of Abathur: "Yahyā, baptize the deceiver in Jordan. Lead him down into the Jordan and baptize him, and lead him up again to the shore, find there set him."</p>
 
 <p>   Then Rūhā<a name="page_51_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_51_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> made herself like to a dove and threw a cross<a name="page_51_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_51_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> over the Jordan. A cross she threw over the Jordan and made its water to change into various colours.<a name="page_51_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_51_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> "O Jordan," she says, "thou sanctifiest me and thou sanctifiest my seven sons."</p>

 <p>   [Then follows what, from its animadversion on Christian institutions and especially on the use of the crucifix, is plainly a later addition. Rūhā is apparently still speaking; she is the Mother of all heresies.]</p>

 prophet hast thou become, who hast left no one to remember thy name. Who will provide thee with provision, who with victuals, and who will follow to the grave after thee?"</p>
 
 <p>   When Yahyā heard this, a tear gathered in his eye; a tear in his eye gathered, and he spake: "It would be pleasant to take a wife, and delightul for me to have children. But only if I take no woman,—and then comes sleep, desire for her seizes me and I neglect my night-prayer. If only desire does not wake in me, and I forget my Lord out of my mind. If only desire does not wake in me, and I neglect my prayer every time."</p>
 
 <p>   When Yahyā said this, there came a Letter from the House of Abathur: "Yahyā, take a wife and found a family, and see that thou dost not let this world come to an end. On the night of Monday and on the night of Tuesday go to thy first<a name="page_53_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_53_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> bedding.

 <p>   Yahyā opened his mouth and spake to Anhar in Jerusalem: "If I leave the world, tell me, what wilt thou do after me?"—"I will not eat and will not drink," she answered him, "until I see thee again."—"A lie hast thou spoken, Anhar, and thy word has come forth in deception. If a day comes and goes, thou eatest and drinkest and forgettest me out of thy mind. I asked thee rather, by Great Life and by the eve of the Day whose name is dear: If I leave the world, tell me, what wilt thou do after me?"—" I will not wash and I will not comb me," says she to him, "until I see thee again."—"Again hast thou spoken a lie and thy word has come forth in deception. If a month comes and a month goes, thou washest and combest thee and forgettest me out of thy mind. Again did I ask thee, Anhar, by the first bed in which we both lie: If I leave my body, tell me, what wilt thou do after me?"—"I will put on no new garments," she answers him, "until I see thee again."—"Again hast thou spoken

 <p>   "Why dost thou not tell me all, Yahyā," says she to him; "and how sorely thou bruisest the whole of my body! If thou dost depart, when wilt thou return, that my eyes may fall upon thine?"—"If a woman in labour descends into Sheōl<a name="page_55_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_55_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> and a bell is hung up for her in the graveyard. If they paint a picture in Sheōl, and she then goes forth and they give a feast in the graveyard. If a bride parades round in Sheōl, and they celebrate marriage in the graveyard.

 <p>   Then answered she him: "My lord, how shall it be that a woman in labour . . . "[and so on, repeating the above].</p>
 
 <p>   "If thou knowest," he makes answer unto her, "that this does never happen, why dost thou press me with asking: When dost thou return? I go hence and return not. Happy the day when thou dost still see me. If there were a going-away and returning, then would no widow be found in this world. If there were a going-away and returning, then would no fatherless be found in the world. If there were a going-away and returning, then no Nazōræans would be found in the world."</p>
 
 <p>   Thereon Anhar opened her mouth and spake to Yahyā in Jerusalem: "I will buy thee for dear gold a brick grave<a name="page_55_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_55_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> and have a boxing of wood<a name="page_55_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_55_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> joinered together for thee in the graveyard."

 <p>   The region of Jerusalem quakes and the wall of the priests rocks. Elizar, the great house, stands there and his body trembles. The Jews gather together, come unto Old Father Zakhriā and they speak to him: "O Old Father Zakhriā, thou art to have a son. Tell us now, what name shall we give him? Shall we give

 <p>   When Enishbai heard this, she cried out and she said: "Of all these names which you name, will I not give him one; but the name Yahyā-Yōhānā will I give him, [the name] which Life's self has given unto him."</p>
 
 <p>   When the Jews heard this, they were filled with wicked anger against her and said: "What weapon shall we make ready for [a certain] one<a name="page_57_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_57_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> and his mother, that he be slain by our hand?"</p>

 <p>   Who told Battai, who instructed Battai, who told Battai to go and say to Enishbai: "A youth has come to Judæa, a prophet come to Jerusalem. A youth has come to Judæa; his guardian angel stands by him. His mouth is like thee and his lips [like] his father, Old Father Zakhriā.

The Sun down-murmured from heaven and the Moon from its place mid the stars. The Sun opened his mouth and spoke to Old Father Zakhriā in Jerusalem: "Old Father Zakhriā, thou great dotard (?), who has grown old and lost his wits, like an Arab whom his <i>kismet</i> has forsaken.<a name="page_58_fr_4"></a><a href="#page_58_note_4"><sup><small>4</small></sup></a> A youth has come to Judæa, a prophet come to Jerusalem.

 <p>   When Yahyā said this, Anōsh, the treasure, knew that Yahyā is wise. Thereon Anōsh, the treasure, spake to the Sun in Jerusalem: "Take for me care of the youth, the Man, who is sent by the King. Take for me care of the youth, until we ask for him." Then Anōsh, the treasure, spake to the Moon in Jerusalem: "Take for me care of the youth, the Man, who is sent by the King. Take for me care of the youth, until we ask for him."</p>

 <p>   YAHYĀ proclaims and speaks: "Stand I not alone? Because of my voice the [heavenly] wheels quake and the chariots capsize. The tempest became silent and settled down in the world's deserts. Sun and Moon wail, and Earth and Heaven mourn."</p>
 
 <p>   Messiah opened his mouth and spake to Yahyā in Jerusalem:
 
 <!------------------------page 60------------------------>
 
 <a name="page_60"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 60</font></a>
 
 "I asked thee, Yahyā, by Great Life and by Sunday, whose name is dear. I asked thee Yahyā, by the Way, whereby the Men of piety put to the test go without hindrance. Tell me: To what is the shape of Ṣauriēl's<a name="page_60_fr_1"></a><a href="#page_60_note_1"><sup><small>1</small></sup></a> knife like? Tell me: If the soul leaves the body, with what is it clothed, and to what is it like in the vain body? Surely the soul is not possibly like the blood, that it should become heated in the body and come to a stop in it? Surely the soul is not possibly like the wind, that it should fare to the mountains, be lost there and come to a stop? Surely the soul is not possibly like the dew, that it should fall on the fruit and be lost?"</p>
 
 <p>   When Messiah said this, Yahyā cries aloud; tears come to him without ceasing, and he speaks: "[God] forbid that the high King of Light should look for lot in deceivers. The soul is not like the blood, that it should become heated in the body and come to a stop, The soul is not like the dew, that it should fall on the fruit and be lost. The soul is not like the wind, that it should fare to the mountains and come to a stop. Firmly developed has the soul been brought into the vain body. If the soul has kept herself perfect, she ascends in a garment of glory.</p>
 
 <p>   "Ṣauriēl's knife consists of three flames.<a name="page_60_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_60_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> When he (Ṣ) drives her (the soul) to hasten, so as to bear her away, he lets loose the three flames against her. One he lets loose against her in the evening, the other at cock-crow; the third lets he loose 'gainst her at the coming-forth of the rays. If the fire begins to be fierce, the soul slips out of the feet and the knees. Out of the feet and the knees slips she, and draws nigh to the hips. Thereon leaves she the hips, reaches the heart, and seeks to keep there her ground. Then falls she into the breast, and it squeezes ... ... The eyes, the face and the lips of the man twitch, and the tongue twists hither and thither.</p>
 
 <p>   "Then Ṣauriēl sits on the eyebrows; [he sits] and speaks to her: 'Go hence, O Soul! Why dost thou still watch over the body?'—Then says she to him: 'Thou wilt hale me, Ṣauriēl, out of the body. First show me my vesture [and clothe me therewith]; then hale me out and hence bring me.'—'First bring me

 <p>   "[The women] who wept ran hither and thither and [the men] who wailed ran hither and thither, as long as the body lay there before them. When the soul leaves the body, four<a name="page_61_fr_2"></a><a href="#page_61_note_2"><sup><small>2</small></sup></a> go forth to the graveyard. [The women] who wept ran hither and thither. the men who wailed ran hither and thither; and they ran hither and thither crying, until they lowered it into the pit. When they had lowered the vain body and covered it over [<i>sc</i>. with earth], then the women ceased fram their death-wail. They filled up the pit, and the men went away... ... . In haste left they the body and grave and went away; they took hold of cup and ate bread and forgot the vain body.—Now, an thou wilt, Ṣauriēl, let me stay here still two days. Then will I sell the whole of my goods and share out among my sons, and will take my vesture with me, the robe that ascends to Light's region.'</p>
 
 <p>   "Natheless Ṣauriēl returned answer unto her: 'Is there a child that has left the womb of its mother, and that they shall have brought back again into its mother, that I should leave thee in the Wicked Ones'<a name="page_61_fr_3"></a><a href="#page_61_note_3"><sup><small>3</small></sup></a> Dwelling, so that thou mayest see after a sharing among thy sons? I will lead thee hence and put the robe of darkness upon [thee], for that thou hast not let thyself be warned in this world, and hast not loved thy way to Light's region. Therefore shalt thou be put in ward in the House of the Wicked, till Heaven and Earth pass away.'"</p>

 <p><a name="page_35_note_1"></a><a href="#page_35_fr_1">1</a> Because Yōhānā is mentioned only once in the <i>Genzā</i>, Brandt supposes that the John-Book pieces must be later in date. But surely this is not a scientific conjecture. It is rather to be supposed that the John-pieces were naturally gathered together from the general mass of material when the collection-process began. Though Yahyā is the Arabic form of the name, Yōhānā alternates with it; this shows a later redaction in the Mohammedan period, when the people vulgarly spoke Arabic, but says nothing as to the date of earlier writings from which the pieces were copied out.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_35_note_2"></a><a href="#page_35_fr_2">2</a> <i>Ur-ashlam</i>, a mock-name or derisive caricature-permutation = 'Ur perfected' it. Ur is originally the Chaldæan Deus Lunus; he is the eldest son of Rūhā, the World-Mother, and corresponds in some respects with the Yaldabaōth of 'Ophite' gnosticism.</p>

 <p><a name="page_35_note_4"></a><a href="#page_35_fr_4">4</a> The Elizabeth of Luke. The name may be some mystical echo of Elisheba, the wife of Aaron, the first priest, just as the Miriam of the Jesus birth-story reminds us of Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Moses, the first prophet. If the pre-Christian Palestinian Dorshē Reshumōth may be thought incapable of going so far, the Alexandrian Jewish allegorists, to whose school Philo belonged, would, and did, sublimate the sister or wife of a sage into a figure of his spiritual virtue or power. This will become clearer later on.</p>

 <p><a name="page_35_note_6"></a><a href="#page_35_fr_6">6</a> Cp. the more concrete three Magi motive. It should, however, be noted that Origen (1st half of 3rd cent.) is the first of the Fathers to state that the number of the Magi was 3; Chrysostom, 150 years later, gives their number as 12 (see Lynn Thorndike, <i>A History of Magic and Experimental Science</i> London, 1923, i. 472ff.).</p>

 <p><a name="page_36_note_2"></a><a href="#page_36_fr_2">2</a> The narrative is largely in the familiar style of Danielic and Talmūdic chronological camouflage; the Daniel Book (<i>c</i>. 164 B.C.) throws back the religio-political conflict of the Jews with the kingdorn and Hellenistic religion of Antiochus Epiphanes to the days of Nebuchhadnezzar (<i>c</i>. 600 B.C.), and the Talmūd Jesus stories, for instance, throw back the setting to some 100 years B.C. or advance it to some 100 years A.D. See my <i>Did Jesus Live 100 B.C.?—An Enquiry into the Talmūd-Jesus Stories, the Toldoth Jushu and Some Curious Statements of Epiphanius—Being a Contribution to the Study of Christian Origins</i> (London, 1903). It is to be noted that the Talmūd knows nothing of John; it evidently regards the John-Jesus movement as one and the same kind of heresy. Y. and B. may perhaps be personified types of members of certain contemporary communities or mystical groups. In §54 Y. and B. are called the 'Two Gold-sons.' This reminds us of alchemical symbolism; see my tracing of 'psychical' alchemy to Babylon in <i>The Doctrine of the Subtle Body in Western Tradition</i> (London, 1919), Proem, pp. 25ff. They may have belonged to the early 'Sons of the Sun' tradition—the later Sampsæans of Epiphanius, still later in wider distribution known to the Moslim historians as Shemsīyeh (Shamish = the Sun). This hypothesis is strengthened by the apparently cryptic gloss Beni-Amin, 'Sons of (the) Amēn' (cp. Rev. iii. 14: These things saith the Amēn, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of the creation of God."). I have no space here to follow up this conjecture; but L. seems to me to be, not only nodding, but fast asleep, when he assumes that the Mandæan writers were simply ignoramuses who mistook Ben-Yamin for Beni-Amin. The Heb. derivation of Benjamin is given very variously In the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha of the O.T. L. refers to Yaqif (clearly Jacob) as Joseph.</p>

 <p><a name="page_36_note_4"></a><a href="#page_36_fr_4">4</a> Can this be camouflage for Rabbi Eliazer ben Hyrcanus, the founder of the famous Rabbinical school at Lud (Lydda) and teacher of Akiba? He flourished 70-100 A.D. R. Eliazer was imprisoned for heresy; the Talmūd account connects this accusation of heresy with an interview between him and a certain Jacob of Kephar Sechania, a city in lower Galilee, who is said to have been one of the disciples of Jeshu ha-Notzri, <i>i.e.</i> J. the Nāzōræan (see <i>D.J.L. 100 B.C.?</i>—pp. 216 ff. for reference and discussion). But Eliazer is a name of great distinction in Pharisaic priestly tradition, especially that of the Maccabæan proto-martyr priest, the teacher of the martyred Seven Sons and the Mother in IV. <i>Maccabees</i>.</p>

 <p><a name="page_41_note_2"></a><a href="#page_41_fr_2">2</a> Brandt (Art. <i>E.R.E.</i>) apologetically conjectures that this observance of Sun-day (<i>hab šabbā</i>) was taken over from Syro-Christian usage. But reverence for Sun-day is fundamental with the MM., and it is one of their celestial personifications. The MM. loathed idolatry and sun-worship; they worshipped Life and Light, but may have venerated the light as the symbol of that Light. The same puzzle occurs with the prayer-custom of the Essenes, who turned to the rising sun in their morning orisons. The problem we have here to face is the existence of a pre-Christian Sun-day as rigidly observed as the Jews and others kept the Sabbath, and not a 'Pagan' holy-day.</p>

The first age or world-period was that of Adam; the second, of Rām and Rūd (fem.); the third, of Shurbai and Sharhab-ēl; the fourth, that of the Flood. The second generation perished by the sword and pestilence, the third by fire (cp. § 25 <a href="#page_45">below</a>). The Indian <i>yugas</i> came from the same source. As to the prophetica1 vesture in this special connection, apart from the more general wide-spread notion of the garment of light or robe of glory, cp. the Rabbinical tradition in the mediæval <i>Yaschar</i> or <i>Sepher Hai-yaschar</i> (<i>The Book of the Just</i>, more commonly known as <i>The Book of the Generations of Adam</i> or <i>The Book of the History of Man</i>) which contains ancient material, translated into French by Chevalier P. L. B. Drach: "After the death of Adam and Eve the coats [<i>sc</i>. of skin—see R. Eisler's brilliant conjecture that J. the B. outwardly assumed his camel's hair robe in memory of the first garments of the fallen protoplasts, as a sign of repentance, in the preceding study] were given to Enoch, son of Jared. Enoch, at the time of his being taken to God, gave them to his son Methusaleh. After the death of Methusaleh, Noah took them and hid them in the Ark. Ham stole them, and hid them so successfully that his brethren were unable to find them. Ham gave them secretly to his eldest son, Chus, who made a mystery of it to his brothers and sons. When Nimrod [ = Zoroaster, see Bousset, <i>op. cit.</i>, index] reached the age of 20 years, he (Chus) clothed him with the vesture, which gave him extraordinary strength" Migne, <i>Dic. des Apocryphes</i>, ii. 1102, 1150; and see my <i>World-Mystery</i> (London, 2nd ed., 1907), § 'The Soul-Vestures,' pp. 115ff.).

There is a strong Mandæan flavour about this gloss, which doubtless rested on early tradition. See F. C. Burkitt, <i>Evangelion da-Mepharreshe</i> (Cambridge, 1904), ii. 115. This is the Christian and not the M.

Bihrām is a later form of the Avestan Verethragna; he is generally called 'the Great.' R'himath-Haiyē = the Living or Life's  R. In the <i>Qolastā</i> or Liturgies there is a R'hum-Hai twice mentioned; he is 'Life's Beloved,' one of the four Sons of Light, or alternately of Salvation. Nṣab is elsewhere (§ 4, 8) called N. Zīwā, that is Radiant N.; he is regarded as the Great Watcher (§ 9), and his name means 'Planter,' 'Fashioner.' Sām is also called S.-Haiyē. S. the Living; he too is 'Watcher of the æons' (G.

Can she then have any connection with the Iexai or Yechai, the complement of Elxai (the 'Hidden Power'), mentioned by Epiphanius? The muddled-up account of the Eschasæans in the heresiological Fathers seems to me to have a close connection with the Mandæan notions (see my <i>D. J. L. 100 B.C.?</i>—ch. xviii, 'Concerning the Book of Elxai,' pp. 365-387 (London, 1903), and Brandt's study, <i>Elchasai: ein Religionsstifter und sein Werk</i> (Leipzig, 1912).

It might even convey the idea of Fulness (Gk. <i>Plērōma</i>), but this is hazardous. The difficulty with Treasure is that there are also two technical M. terms for Treasure, Treasury or Treasure-house (<i>sc</i>. of Life, cp. § 57, forewords). <i>Uthra</i> seems sometimes to equate with Angel; but again this has a term for itself (<i>malaka</i>). In any case it means a heavenly or spiritual being, excarnate or incarnate, and therefore the phrase signifies the Heavenly or Spiritual Enoch. See L.'s dissertation. '<i>Uthra und Malaka</i>,' in <i>Orientalische Studien Theodor Nöldtke zum siebzigsten Geburtstag (12 Marz, 1906) gewidmet</i> (Giesgen, 1906), pp. 537-545.</p>

I would suggest, though with hesitation, that 10's, l00's and 1000's represent 'powers,' <i>i.e.</i> so-called higher or wider planes of activity or development, and digits certain fundamental characteristics.
