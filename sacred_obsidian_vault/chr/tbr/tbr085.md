   <h3 align="center">FOURTH DOOM.</h3>  <h3 align="center">THE ANTICHRISTIAN NATIONS.</h3>  
 <p align="center">Rev. 19:21.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">And the remnant were slain with the <b>SWORD</b> of Him that sat upon the Horse, which sword proceeded out of His mouth: and all the fowls were filled with their flesh."</font></dir>  
 <p>So great will be the destruction of human life in the Battle of Armageddon, that God will prepare for it in advance less the stench of the unburied dead should breed pestilence.</p>  
 <p>"And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a loud voice, saying to all the <b>fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven</b> (Buzzards, Vultures, Eagles, etc.), Come and gather yourselves together unto the</p>  
 <p align="center"><b>SUPPER OF THE GREAT GOD</b>,</p>  
 <p>that ye may eat the <b>flesh</b> of <b>Kings</b> . . . <b>Captains</b> . . <b>Mighty Men</b>, and the <b>flesh</b> of <b>horses</b> and of them that <b>sit on them</b> (common soldiers), and the <b>flesh</b> of <b>all men</b>, both <b>free</b> and <b>bond</b>, both small and great." Rev. 19:17, 18.</p>  
 <p>This "Feast" is described in the Old Testament.</p>  
 <p></p><dir><font size="1">"And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God, Speak unto every <b>feathered fowl</b>, and to every <b>beast of the field</b>, Assemble yourselves, and come, gather yourselves on every side to <b>My Sacrifice</b>, that I do sacrifice for you, even a great sacrifice upon the <b>Mountains of Israel</b>, that ye may eat <b>flesh</b>, and drink <b>blood</b>. Ye shall eat the <b>flesh</b> of the <b>Mighty</b>, and <b>drink the blood of the Princes of the Earth</b>, of <b>rams</b>, of <b>lambs</b>, and of <b>goats</b>, of <b>bullocks</b>, all of them fatlings of Bashan. And ye shall eat <b>fat till ye be full</b>, and <b>drink blood till ye be drunken</b>. . . . Thus ye shall be filled '<b>at My Table</b>,' with <b>horses</b> and <b>chariots</b> (their occupants), with <b>Mighty Men</b>, and with all <b>Men of War</b>, said the Lord God." Ez. 39:1-22.</font></dir>  
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 175</font></a></p>  
 <p>And in the same chapter we are told that the "<b>House of Israel</b>," the occupants of Palestine in that day, shall be <b>seven months</b> burying the bones of the dead, the flesh having been eaten by the birds and beasts of prey, and the wood from the weapons of warfare, army wagons, spears, etc., shall last the inhabitants of the land for fuel <b>seven years</b>, so that they will not have to take wood out of the field, nor cut down any out of the forests.</p>  
 <p>The words in Rev. 19:21, "and all the <b>fowls were filled with their flesh</b>," declare that those "<b>Fowl Guests</b>" will be <b>GORGED WITH CARRION</b>.</p>  
 <p>Then will be fulfilled the words of Jesus--"For wheresoever the carcase is, there will the <b>Eagles</b> (birds of prey) be gathered together." Matt. 24:27, 28. The eagle feeds mainly on fresh meat. The Hebrews classed the eagle among the birds of prey, such as the vulture.</p>  
 <p>The destruction of this great army will be brought about by supernatural means, and as there is to be a "<b>GREAT HAIL</b>" to fall from heaven upon the enemies of God when the "Seventh Vial" is poured out, which includes this period, that may be the means God will use, for it was in that way that the enemies of Israel were destroyed on the same battlefield in the "Battle of Beth-Horon" in the days of Joshua. Josh. 10:1-11.</p>
