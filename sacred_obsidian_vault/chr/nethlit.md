 Form for the Administration of Baptism
 
 
 The principal parts of the doctrine of holy baptism are these
 three:
 
 First. That we with our children are conceived and born in sin,
 and therefore are children of wrath, in so much that we cannot
 enter into the kingdom of God, except we are born again. This,
 the dipping in, or sprinkling with water teaches us, whereby
 the impurity of our souls is signified, and we admonished to
 loathe, and humble ourselves before God, and seek for our
 purification and salvation without ourselves.
 
 Secondly. Holy baptism witnesses and seals unto us the washing
 away of our sins through Jesus Christ. Therefore we are
 baptized in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the
 Holy Ghost. For when we are baptized in the name of the Father,
 God the Father witnesses and seals unto us, that he does make
 an eternal covenant of grace with us, and adopts us for his
 children and heirs, and therefore will provide us with every
 good thing, and avert all evil or turn it to our profit. And
 when we are baptized in the name of the Son, the Son seals unto
 us, that he does wash us in his blood from all our sins,
 incorporating us into the fellowship of his death and
 resurrection, so that we are freed from all our sins, and
 accounted righteous before God. In like manner, when we are
 baptized in the name of the Holy Ghost, the Holy Ghost assures
 us, by this holy sacrament, that he will dwell in us, and
 sanctify us to be members of Christ, applying unto us, that
 which we have in Christ, namely, the washing away of our sins,
 and the daily renewing of our lives, till we shall finally be
 presented without spot or wrinkle among the assembly of the
 elect in life eternal.
 
 Thirdly. Whereas in all covenants, there are contained two
 parts: therefore are we by God through baptism, admonished of,
 and obliged unto new obedience, namely, that we cleave to this
 one God, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost; that we trust in him, and
 love him with all our hearts, with all our souls, with all our
 mind, and with all our strength; that we forsake the world,
 crucify our old nature, and walk in a new and holy life.
   And if we sometimes through weakness fall into sin, we must
 not therefore despair of God's mercy, nor continue in sin,
 since baptism is a seal and undoubted testimony, that we have
 an eternal covenant of grace with God.
 
 
 1. To Infants of Believers
 
 And although our young children do not understand these things,
 we may not therefore exclude them from baptism, for as they are
 without their knowledge, partakers of the condemnation in Adam,
 so are they again received unto grace in Christ; as God speaks
 unto Abraham, the father of all the faithful, and therefore
 unto us and our children (Gen. 17:7), saying, "I will establish
 my covenant between me and thee, and thy seed after thee, in
 their generations, for an everlasting covenant; to be a God
 unto thee, and to thy seed after thee." This also the Apostle
 Peter testifies, with these words (Acts 2:39), "For the promise
 is unto you and to your children, and to all that are afar off,
 even as many as the Lord our God shall call." Therefore God
 formerly commanded them to be circumcised, which was a seal of
 the covenant, and of the righteousness of faith; and therefore
 Christ also embraced them, laid his hands upon them and blessed
 them (Mark 10).
   Since then baptism is come in the place of circumcision,
 therefore infants are to be baptized as heirs of the kingdom of
 God, and of his covenant. And parents are in duty bound,
 further to instruct their children herein, when they shall
 arrive to years of discretion.
   That therefore this holy ordinance of God may be administered
 to his glory, to our comfort, and to the edification of his
 Church, let us call upon his holy name.
 
 
 Prayer
 
   O Almighty and eternal God, Thou, who hast according to thy
 severe judgment punished the unbelieving and unrepentant world
 with the flood, and hast according to thy great mercy saved and
 protected believing Noah and his family; Thou, who hast drowned
 the obstinate Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, and hast led
 thy people Israel through the midst of the Sea upon dry ground,
 by which baptism was signified - we beseech thee, that Thou
 wilt be pleased of thine infinite mercy, graciously to look
 upon these children, and incorporate them by thy Holy Spirit,
 into thy Son Jesus Christ, that they may be buried with him
 into his death, and be raised with him in newness of life; that
 they may daily follow him, joyfully bearing their cross, and
 cleave unto him in true faith, firm hope, and ardent love; that
 they may, with a comfortable sense of thy favour, leave this
 life, which is nothing but a continual death, and at the last
 day, may appear without terror before the judgment seat of
 Christ thy Son, through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee
 and the Holy Ghost, one only God, lives and reigns forever.
 Amen.
 
 
 An exhortation to the Parents
 
 Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, you have heard that baptism
 is an ordinance of God, to seal unto us and to our seed his
 covenant; therefore it must be used for that end, and not out
 of custom or superstition. That it may then be manifest, that
 you are thus minded, you are to answer sincerely to these
 questions:
 
 First, Whether you acknowledge, that although our children are
 conceived and born in sin, and therefore are subject to all
 miseries, yea, to condemnation itself; yet that they are
 sanctified in Christ, and therefore, as members of his Church
 ought to be baptized?
 
 Secondly. Whether you acknowledge the doctrine which is
 contained in the Old and New Testament, and in the articles of
 the Christian faith, and which is taught here in this Christian
 Church, to be the true and perfects doctrine of salvation?
 
 Thirdly. Whether you promise and intend to see these children,
 when come to the years of discretion (whereof you are either
 parent or witness), instructed and brought up in the aforesaid
 doctrine, or help or cause them to be instructed therein, to
 the utmost of your power?
 
 Answer. Yes.
 
 Then the Minister of God's Word, in baptizing, shall say,
 <name>, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, and of the
 Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.
 
 
 Thanksgiving
 
 Almighty God and merciful Father, we thank and praise thee,
 that Thou hast forgiven us, and our children, all our sins,
 through the blood of thy beloved Son Jesus Christ, and received
 us through thy Holy Spirit as members of thine only begotten
 Son, and adopted us to be thy children, and sealed and
 confirmed the same unto us by holy baptism; we beseech thee,
 through the same Son of thy love, that Thou wilt be pleased
 always to govern these baptized children by Thy Holy Spirit,
 that they may be piously and religiously educated, increase and
 grow up in the Lord Jesus Christ, that they then may
 acknowledge thy fatherly goodness and mercy, which Thou hast
 shown to them and us, and live in all righteousness, under our
 only Teacher, King and High Priest, Jesus Christ; and manfully
 fight against, and overcome sin, the devil and his whole
 dominion, to the end that they may eternally praise and magnify
 thee, and thy Son Jesus Christ, together with the Holy Ghost,
 the one only true God. Amen.
 
 
 2. To Adult Persons
 
 However children of Christian parents (although they understand
 not this mystery) must be baptized by virtue of the covenant;
 yet it is not lawful to baptize those who are come to years of
 discretion, except they first be sensible of their sins, and
 make confession both of their repentance and faith in Christ.
 For this cause did not only John the Baptist preach (according
 to the command of God) the baptism of repentance, and baptized,
 for the remission of sins, those who confessed their sins (Mark
 1 and Luke 3); but our Lord Jesus Christ also commanded his
 disciples to teach all nations, and then to baptize them, in
 the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost
 (Matt. 28, Mark 16), adding this promise: "He that believeth
 and is baptized shall be saved". According to which rule, the
 Apostles, as appears from Acts 2, 10 and 16, baptized none who
 were of years of discretions, but such as made confession of
 their faith and repentance. Therefore it is not lawful now to
 baptize any other adult person, than such as have been taught
 the mysteries of holy baptism, by the preaching of the gospel,
 and are able to give an account of their faith by the
 confession of the mouth.
   That therefore this holy ordinance of God may be administered
 to his glory, to our comfort, and to the edification of his
 Church, let us call upon his holy name:
 
 O Almighty and eternal God, Thou, who hast according to thy
 severe judgment punished the unbelieving and unrepentant world
 with the flood, and hast according to thy great mercy saved and
 protected believing Noah and his family; Thou, who hast drowned
 the obstinate Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, and hast led
 thy people Israel through the midst of the Sea upon dry ground,
 by which baptism is signified - we beseech thee, that Thou wilt
 be pleased of thine infinite mercy, graciously to look upon
 this person, and incorporate him by thy Holy Spirit into thy
 Son Jesus Christ, that he may be buried with him into his
 death, and be raised with him in newness of life; that he may
 daily follow him, joyfully bearing his cross, and cleave unto
 him in true faith, firm hope, and ardent love; that he may with
 a comfortable sense of thy favour, leave this life, which is
 nothing but a continual death, and at the last day, may appear
 without terror before the judgment seat of Christ thy Son,
 through Jesus Christ our Lord, who with thee and the Holy
 Ghost, one only God, lives and reigns forever. Amen.
 
 Since therefore thou, <name>, are also desirous of holy
 baptism, to the end, that it may be to thee a seal of thine in-
 grafting into the Church of God; that it may appear that thou
 do not only receive the Christian religion, in which thou have
 been privately instructed by us and of which also thou have
 made confession before us, but that thou (through the grace of
 God), intends and purposes to lead a life according to the
 same, thou are sincerely to give answer before God and his
 Church.
 
 First. Do thou believe in the only true God, distinct in three
 persons, Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, who has made heaven and
 earth, and all that in them is, of nothing, and still maintains
 and governs them, insomuch that nothing comes to pass, either
 in heaven or on earth, without his divine will?
   Answer. Yes.
 
 Secondly. Do thou believe that thou are conceived and born in
 sin and therefore are a child of wrath by nature, wholly
 incapable of doing any good, and prone to all evil; and that
 thou have frequently, in thought, word and deed, transgressed
 the commandments of the Lord: and whether thou are heartily
 sorry for these sins?
   Answer. Yes.
 
 Thirdly. Do thou believe that Christ, who is the true and
 eternal God, and very man, who took his human nature on him out
 of the flesh and blood of the Virgin Mary, is given thee of
 God, to be thy Saviour, and that thou does receive by this
 faith, remission of sins in his blood, and that thou are made
 by the power of the Holy Ghost, a member of Jesus Christ and
 his Church?
   Answer. Yes.
 
 Fourthly. Do thou assent to all the articles of the Christian
 religion, as they are taught here, in this Christian Church,
 according to the Word of God; and purpose steadfastly to
 continue in the same doctrine to the end of thy life; and also
 do thou reject all heresies and schisms, repugnant to this
 doctrine, and promise to persevere in the communion of the
 Christian Church, not only in the hearing of the Word, but also
 in the use of the Lord's Supper?
   Answer. Yes.
 
 Fifthly. Has thou taken a firm resolution always to lead a
 Christian life; to forsake the world and its evil lusts, as is
 becoming the members of Christ and his Church; and to submit
 thyself to all Christian admonitions?
   Answer. Yes.
 
 The good and great God mercifully grant his grace and blessing
 to this thy purpose, through Jesus Christ Amen.
 
 
 Thanksgiving
 
 Almighty God and merciful Father, we thank and praise thee,
 that thou hast forgiven us and our children all our sins,
 through the blood of thy Son Jesus Christ, and received us
 through thy Holy Spirit, as members of thine only begotten Son,
 and adopted us to be thy children, and sealed and confirmed the
 same unto us by holy baptism. We beseech thee, through the same
 Son of thy love, that thou wilt be pleased always to govern
 this baptized person by thy Holy Spirit, that he may lead a
 christian and godly life, and increase and grow up in the Lord
 Jesus Christ, that he may acknowledge thy fatherly goodness and
 mercy, which thou hast shown to him and to us, and live in all
 righteousness, under our only Teacher, King, and High Priest,
 Jesus Christ; and that he may manfully fight against and
 overcome sin, the devil and his whole dominion, to the end that
 he may eternally praise and magnify thee, and thy Son Jesus
 Christ together with the Holy Ghost, the one only true God.
 Amen.

 Form for the Administration of the Lord's Supper
 
 
 Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, attend to the words of the
 institution of the Holy Supper of our Lord Jesus Christ, as
 they are delivered by the holy Apostle Paul. 1 Cor. 11:23-30.
   "For I have received of the Lord, that which also I delivered
 unto you, that the Lord Jesus, the same night in which he was
 betrayed, took bread; and when he had given thanks, he brake
 it, and said, Take, eat; this is my body which is broken for
 you, this do in remembrance of me. And after the same manner
 also, he took the cup, when he had supped, saying, This cup is
 the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as oft as ye drink
 it in remembrance of me; for as oft as ye eat this bread, and
 drink this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come.
 Wherefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink this cup
 of the Lord unworthily, shall be guilty of the body and blood
 of the Lord. But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat
 of that bread, and drink of that cup; for he that eateth and
 drinketh unworthily, eateth and drinketh damnation to himself,
 not discerning the Lord's body.
 
 That we may now celebrate the Supper of the Lord to our
 comfort, it is above all things necessary,
   First. Rightly to examine ourselves.
   Secondly. To direct it to that end for which Christ has
 ordained and instituted the same, namely, to his remembrance.
 
 The true examination of ourselves consists of these three
 parts:
 
 First. That every one consider by himself, his sins and the
 curse due to him for them, to the end that he may abhor and
 humble himself before God: considering that the wrath of God
 against sin is so great, that (rather than it should go
 unpunished) he has punished the same in his beloved Son Jesus
 Christ, with the bitter and shameful death of the cross.
 
 Secondly. That every one examine his own heart, whether he does
 believe this faithful promise of God, that all his sins are
 forgiven him only for the sake of the passion and death of
 Jesus Christ, and that the perfect righteousness of Christ is
 imputed and freely given him as his own, yea, so perfectly, as
 if he had satisfied in his own person for all his sins, and
 fulfilled all righteousness.
 
 Thirdly. That every one examine his own conscience, whether he
 purposes henceforth to show true thankfulness to God in his
 whole life, and to walk uprightly before him; as also, whether
 he has laid aside unfeignedly all enmity, hatred, and envy, and
 does firmly resolve hence forward to walk in true love and
 peace with his neighbour.
   All those, then, who are thus disposed, God will certainly
 receive in mercy, and count them worthy partakers of the table
 of his Son Jesus Christ. On the contrary, those who do not feel
 this testimony in their hearts, eat and drink judgment to
 themselves.
   Therefore, we also, according to the command of Christ and
 the Apostle Paul, admonish all those who are defiled with the
 following sins, to keep themselves from the table of the Lord,
 and declare to them that they have no part in the kingdom of
 Christ; such as all idolaters, all those who invoke deceased
 saints, angels or other creatures; all those who worship
 images; all enchanters, diviners, charmers, and those who
 confide in such enchantments; all despisers of God, and of his
 Word, and of the holy sacraments: all blasphemers; all those
 who are given to raise discord, sects and mutiny in Church or
 State; all perjured persons; all those who are disobedient to
 their parents and superiors; all murderers, contentious
 persons, and those who live in hatred and envy against their
 neighbours; all adulterers, whoremongers, drunkards, thieves,
 usurers, robbers, gamesters, covetous, and all who lead
 offensive lives.
   All these, while they continue in such sins, shall abstain
 from this meat (which Christ has ordained only for the
 faithful), lest their judgment and condemnation be made the
 heavier.
   But this is not designed (dearly beloved brethren and sisters
 in the Lord), to deject the contrite hearts of the faithful, as
 if none might come to the supper of the Lord, but those who are
 without sin; for we do not come to this supper, to testify
 thereby that we are perfect and righteous in ourselves; but on
 the contrary, considering that we seek our life out of
 ourselves in Jesus Christ, we acknowledge that we lie in the
 midst of death; therefore, notwithstanding we feel many
 infirmities and miseries in ourselves, as namely, that we have
 not perfect faith, and that we do not give ourselves to serve
 God with that zeal as we are bound, but have daily to strive
 with the weakness of our faith, and the evil lusts of our
 flesh; yet, since we are (by the grace of the Holy Spirit)
 sorry for these weaknesses, and earnestly desirous to fight
 against our unbelief, and to live according to all the
 commandments of God: therefore we rest assured that no sin or
 infirmity, which still remains against our will, in us, can
 hinder us from being received of God in mercy, and from being
 made worthy partakers of this heavenly meat and drink.
 
 Let us now also consider, to what end the Lord has instituted
 his Supper, namely, that we do it in remembrance of him. Now
 after this manner are we to remember him by it:
 
 First. That we are confidently persuaded in our hearts, that
 our Lord Jesus Christ (according to the promises made to our
 forefathers in the Old Testament) was sent of the Father into
 the world; that he assumed our flesh and blood; that he bore
 for us the wrath of God (under which we should have perished
 everlastingly) from the beginning of his incarnation, to the
 end of his life upon earth; and that he has fulfilled, for us,
 all obedience to the divine law, and righteousness; especially,
 when the weight of our sins and the wrath of God pressed out of
 him the bloody sweat in the garden, where he was bound that we
 might be freed from our sins; that he afterwards suffered
 innumerable reproaches that we might never be confounded; that
 he was innocently condemned to death, that we might be
 acquitted at the judgment-seat of God; yea, that he suffered
 his blessed body to be nailed on the cross - that he might fix
 thereon the handwriting of our sins; and has also taken upon
 himself the curse due to us, that he might fill us with his
 blessings: and has humbled himself unto the deepest reproach
 and pains of hell, both in body and soul, on the tree of the
 cross, when he cried out with a loud voice, "My God, my God!
 why hast thou forsaken me?" that we might be accepted of God
 and never be forsaken of him: and finally confirmed with his
 death and shedding of his blood, the new and eternal testament,
 that covenant of grace and reconciliation when he said: "It is
 finished."
 
 Secondly. And that we might firmly believe that we belong to
 this covenant of grace, the Lord Jesus Christ, in his last
 Supper, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it,
 and gave it to his disciples and said, "Take, eat, this is my
 body which is broken for you, this do in remembrance of me; in
 like manner also after supper he took the cup, gave thanks and
 said, Drink ye all of it; this cup is the new testament in my
 blood, which is shed for you and for many, for the remission of
 sins, this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me":
 that is, as often as ye eat of this bread and drink of this
 cup, you shall thereby as by a sure remembrance and pledge, be
 admonished and assured of this my hearty love and faithfulness
 towards you; that, whereas you should otherwise have suffered
 eternal death, I have given my body to the death of the cross,
 and shed my blood for you and as certainly feed and nourish
 your hungry and thirsty souls with my crucified body, and shed
 blood, to ever lasting life, as this bread is broken before
 your eyes, and this cup is given to you, and you eat and drink
 the same with your mouth, in remembrance of me.
 
 From this institution of the Holy Supper of our Lord Jesus
 Christ, we see that he directs our faith and trust to his
 perfect sacrifice (once offered on the cross) as to the only
 ground and foundation of our salvation, wherein he is become to
 our hungry and thirsty souls, the true meat and drink of life
 eternal. For by his death he has taken away the cause of our
 eternal death and misery, namely, sin, and obtained for us the
 quickening Spirit, that we by the same (who dwells in Christ as
 in the head, and in us as his members), might have true
 communion with him, and be made partakers of all his blessings,
 of life eternal, righteousness and glory.
   Besides, that we by this same Spirit may also be united as
 members of one body in true brotherly love, as the holy Apostle
 says, "For we, being many, are one bread and one body; for we
 are all partakers of that one bread." For as out of many grains
 one meal is ground, and one bread baked, and out of many
 berries being pressed together, one wine flows, and mixes
 itself together, so shall we all, who by a true faith are in
 grafted into Christ, be altogether one body, through brotherly
 love, for Christ's sake, our beloved Saviour, who has so
 exceedingly loved us, and not only show this in word, but also
 in very deed towards one another.
   Hereto assist us, the Almighty God and Father of our Lord
 Jesus Christ through his Holy Spirit. AMEN.
 
 That we may obtain all this, let us humble ourselves before
 God, and with true faith implore his grace.
 
 Prayer
 
 O most merciful God and Father, we beseech thee, that Thou wilt
 be pleased in this Supper (in which we celebrate the glorious
 remembrance of the bitter death of thy beloved Son Jesus
 Christ) to work in our hearts through the Holy Spirit, that we
 may daily more and more with true confidence, give ourselves up
 unto thy Son Jesus Christ, that our afflicted and contrite
 hearts, through the power of the Holy Ghost, may be fed and
 comforted with his true body and blood; yea, with him, true God
 and man, that only heavenly bread; and that we may no longer
 live in our sins, but he in us, and we in him, and thus truly
 be made partakers of the new and everlasting covenant of grace.
 That we may not doubt but Thou wilt forever be our gracious
 Father, nevermore imputing our sins unto us, and providing us
 with all things necessary, as well for the body as the soul, as
 thy beloved children and heirs; grant us also thy grace, that
 we may take up our cross cheerfully, deny ourselves, confess
 our Saviour, and in all tribulations, with uplifted heads
 expect our Lord Jesus Christ from heaven, where he will make
 our mortal bodies like unto his most glorious body, and take us
 unto him in eternity.
   Our Father which is in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
 kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
 Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as
 we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
 deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power
 and the glory, for ever.
   Strengthen us also by this Holy Supper in the catholic
 undoubted christian faith, whereof we make confession with our
 mouths and hearts, saying:
   I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and
 earth; and in Jesus Christ his only Son our Lord; who was
 conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the virgin Mary, suffered
 under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried, he
 descended into hell: the third day he rose again from the dead,
 he ascended into heaven, and sits at the right hand of God the
 Father Almighty; from thence he shall come to judge the quick
 and the dead.
   I believe in the Holy Ghost; I believe a holy catholic
 church; the communion of saints; the forgiveness of sins; the
 resurrection of the body; and the life everlasting. Amen.
 
 That we may be now fed with the true heavenly bread, Christ
 Jesus, let us not cleave with our hearts unto the external
 bread and wine, but lift them up on high in heaven, where
 Christ Jesus is our Advocate, at the right hand of his heavenly
 Father, whither all the articles of our faith lead us; not
 doubting, but we shall as certainly be fed and refreshed in our
 souls through the working of the Holy Ghost, with his body and
 blood, as we receive the holy bread and wine in remembrance of
 him.
 
 In breaking and distributing the bread, the Minister shall say:
 
 The bread which we break, is the communion of the body of
 Christ.
 
 And when he gives the cup:
 
 The cup of blessing, which we bless, is the communion of the
 blood of Christ.
 
 (During the communion, there shall or may be devoutly sung, a
 psalm, or some chapter read, in remembrance of the death of
 Christ, as the 53rd chapter of Isaiah, the 13th, 14th, 15th,
 16th, 17th, and 18th chapters of John, or the like.)
 
 After the Communion the Minister shall say:
 
 Beloved in the Lord, since the Lord has now fed our souls at
 this table, let us therefore jointly praise his holy name with
 thanksgiving, and every one say in his heart, thus:
   Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless
 his holy name.
   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits.
   Who forgives all thine iniquities; who heals all thy
 diseases.
   Who redeems thy life from destruction, who crowns thee with
 loving kindness and tinder mercies.
   The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger and
 plenteous in mercy.
   He has not dealt with us after our sins, nor rewarded us
 according to our iniquities.
   For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
 mercy towards them that fear him.
   As far as the East is from the West, so far has he removed
 our transgressions from us.
   Like as a father pities his children, so the Lord pities them
 that fear him.
   Who has not spared his own Son, but delivered him up for us
 all, and given us all things with him. Therefore God commends
 therewith his love towards us, in that while we were yet
 sinners, Christ died for us; much more then, being now
 justified in his blood, we shall be saved from wrath through
 him: for, if, when we were enemies, we were reconciled to God
 by the death of his Son; much more being reconciled, we shall
 be saved by his life. Therefore shall my mouth and heart show
 forth the praise of the Lord from this time forth forever more.
 AMEN.
 
 Let every one say with an attentive heart:
 
 Thanksgiving
 
 O! Almighty, merciful God and Father, we render thee most
 humble and hearty thanks, that Thou hast of thy infinite mercy,
 given us thine only begotten Son, for a Mediator and a
 sacrifice for our sins, and to be our meat and drink unto life
 eternal, and that Thou give us lively faith, whereby we are
 made partakers of such great benefits. Thou hast also been
 pleased, that thy beloved Son Jesus Christ should institute and
 ordain his Holy Supper for the confirmation of the same. Grant,
 we beseech thee, O faithful God and Father, that through the
 operation of thy Holy Spirit, the commemoration of the death of
 our Lord Jesus Christ may tend to the daily increase of our
 faith, and saving fellowship with him, through Jesus Christ thy
 Son, in whose name we conclude our prayers, saying:
   Our Father which is in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
 kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
 Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as
 we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
 deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power
 and the glory, for ever. Amen.
 
 
 
 Form of Excommunication
 
 
 Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ; it is known unto you, that we
 have several times, and by several methods declared unto you
 the great sin committed, and the heinous offense given by our
 fellow-member <name>, to the end that he, by your christian
 admonition and prayers to God, might be brought to repentance,
 and so be freed from the bonds of the devil (by whom he is held
 captive), and recovered by the will of the Lord. But we cannot
 conceal from you, with great sorrow, that no one has yet
 appeared before us, who has in the least given us to understand
 that he, by the frequent admonitions given him, (as well in
 private as before witnesses, and in the presence of many), is
 come to any remorse for his sins, or has shown the least token
 of true repentance. Since then he daily aggravates his sin,
 (which in itself is not small), by his stubbornness, and since
 we have signified unto you the last time, that in case he did
 not repent, after such patience shown him by the Church, we
 should be under the disagreeable necessity of being further
 grieved for him, and come to the last remedy; wherefore we at
 this present are necessitated to proceed to this
 excommunication according to the command and charge given us by
 God in his holy Word; to the end that he may hereby be made (if
 possible) ashamed of his sins, and likewise that we may not by
 this rotten and as yet incurable member, put the whole body of
 the Church in danger, and that God's name may not be
 blasphemed.
   Therefore we, the ministers and rulers of the Church of God,
 being here assembled in the name and authority of our Lord
 Jesus Christ, declare before you all, that for the aforesaid
 reasons we have excommunicated, and by these, do excommunicate
 <name> from the Church of God, and from fellowship with Christ,
 and the holy sacraments, and from all the spiritual blessings
 and benefits, which God promises to and bestows upon his
 Church, so long as he obstinately and impenitently persists in
 his sins, and is therefore to be accounted by you as a heathen
 man and a publican, according to the command of Christ (Matt.
 18), who says, that whatsoever his ministers bind on earth,
 shall be bound in heaven.
   Further we exhort you, beloved Christians, to keep no company
 with him, that he may be ashamed; yet count him not as an
 enemy, but at all times admonish him as you would a brother. In
 the meantime let every one take warning by this and such like
 examples; to fear the Lord, and diligently take heed unto
 himself, "If he thinketh he standeth, lest he fall"; but having
 true fellowship with the Father and his Son Jesus Christ,
 together with all faithful Christians, remain steadfast therein
 to the end, and so obtain eternal salvation. You have seen,
 beloved brethren and sisters, in what manner this our
 excommunicated brother has begun to fall, and by degrees is
 come to ruin; observe therefore, how subtle Satan is, to bring
 man to destruction, and to withdraw him from all salutary means
 of salvation: guard then, against the least beginnings of evil,
 "and laying aside," according to the exhortation of the
 apostle, "every weight and the sin which does so easily beset
 us, let us run with patience the race that is set before us,
 looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; be
 sober, watch and pray, lest you enter into temptation. Today,
 if you will hear the voice of the Lord, harden not your hearts,
 but work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;" and
 every one repent of his sins, lest our God humble us again and
 that we be obliged to bewail some one of you; but that you may
 with one accord, living in all godliness, be our crown and joy
 in the Lord.
   Since it is God who works in us, both to will and to do of
 his good pleasure, let us call upon his holy name with
 confession of our sins, saying:
 
 O! Righteous God and merciful Father, we bewail our sins before
 thy high majesty, and acknowledge that we have deserved the
 grief and sorrow caused unto us by the cutting off of this our
 late fellow-member; yea, we all deserve, should Thou enter into
 judgment with us, by reason of our great transgressions, to be
 cut off and banished from thy presence. - But O Lord, Thou art
 merciful unto us for Christ's sake; forgive us our trespasses,
 for we heartily repent of them, and daily work in our hearts a
 greater measure of sorrow for them; that we may, fearing thy
 judgments which thou executes against the stiffnecked,
 endeavour to please thee; grant us to avoid all pollution of
 the world, and those who are cut off from the communion of the
 Church, that we may not make ourselves partakers of their sins;
 and that he who is excommunicated may become ashamed of his
 sins; and since thou desires not the death of a sinner, but
 that he may repent and live, and the bosom of thy Church is
 always open for those, who turn away from their wickedness; we
 therefore humbly beseech thee, to kindle in our hearts a pious
 zeal, that we may labour, with good christian admonitions and
 examples, to bring again this excommunicated person on the
 right way, together with all those, who, through unbelief or
 dissoluteness of life, go astray.
   Give thy blessing to our admonitions, that we may have reason
 thereby to rejoice again in him, for whom we must now mourn,
 and that thy holy name may be praised, through our Lord Jesus
 Christ, who has taught us to pray:
   Our Father which is in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
 kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
 Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as
 we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
 deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power
 and the glory, for ever. Amen.
 
 
 
 Form of Readmitting Excommunicated Persons
 
 
 Beloved in the Lord, it is known to you, that some time ago our
 fellow member <name>, was cut off from the Church of Christ; we
 cannot now conceal from you, that he, by the above mentioned
 remedy, as also by the means of good admonitions and your
 christian prayers, is come so far, that he is ashamed of his
 sins, praying us to be readmitted into the communion of the
 Church.
   Since we, then, by virtues of the command of God, are in duty
 bound to receive such persons with joy, and it being necessary
 that good order should be used therein, we therefore give you
 to understand hereby, that we purpose to loose again the
 aforementioned excommunicated person from the bond of
 excommunication, the next time when by the grace of God we
 celebrate the Supper of the Lord, and receive him again into
 the communion of the Church; except any one of you, in the
 meantime, shall show just cause why this ought not to be done,
 of which you must give notice to us in due time. In the
 meantime, let every one thank the Lord, for the mercy shown
 this poor sinner, beseeching him to perfect his work in him to
 his eternal salvation. Amen.
 
 Afterwards, if no impediment be alleged, the Minister shall
 proceed to the readmission of the excommunicated sinner, in the
 following manner:
 
 Beloved Christians, we have the last time informed you of the
 repentance of our fellow-member <name> to the end, that he
 might with your foreknowledge be again received into the Church
 of Christ: and whereas no one has alleged anything why his
 readmission ought not to take place, we therefore at present
 purpose to proceed to the same.
 
 Our Lord Jesus Christ (Matt. 18), having confirmed the sentence
 of his Church, in the excommunicating of impenitent sinners,
 declares immediately thereupon, "that whatsoever his ministers
 shall loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven"; whereby He
 gives to understand, that when any person is cut off from his
 Church, he is not deprived of all hopes of salvation; but can
 again be loosed from the bonds of condemnation. Therefore,
 since God declares in his word, that he takes no pleasure in
 the death of a sinner, but that he turn from his wickedness and
 live, so the church always hopes for the repentance of the
 backslidden sinner, and keeps her bosom open to receive the
 penitent; accordingly the apostle Paul (1 Cor. 5), commanded
 the Corinthian (whom he had declared ought to be cut off from
 the Church) to be again received and comforted, since being
 reproved by many, he was come to the knowledge of his sins: to
 the end that he should not be swallowed up with overmuch sorrow
 (2 Cor. 2).
 
 Secondly. Christ teaches us in the aforementioned text, that
 the sentence of absolution, which is passed upon such a
 penitent sinner according to the Word of God, is counted sure
 and firm by the Lord; therefore, no one ought to doubt in the
 least, who truly repents, that he is assuredly received by God
 in mercy, as Christ says (John 20), "Whosesoever sins ye remit,
 they are remitted unto them."
   But now to proceed to the matter in hand: I ask thee, <name>,
 whether thou do declare here with all thine heart before God
 and his Church; that thou are sincerely sorry for the sin and
 stubbornness, for which thou has been justly cut off from the
 Church? Whether thou do also truly believe, that the Lord has
 forgiven thee, and does forgive thy sins for Christ's sake, and
 that thou therefore are desirous to be readmitted into the
 Church of Christ, promising henceforth to live in all godliness
 according to the command of the Lord?
   Answer. Yes, verily.
 
 Then the Minister shall further say:
   We then, here assembled in the name and authority of the lord
 Jesus Christ, declare thee, <name>, to be absolved from the
 bonds of excommunication; and do receive thee again into the
 Church of the Lord, and declare unto thee that thou are in the
 communion of Christ and of the holy sacraments, and of all the
 spiritual blessings and benefits of God, which he promises to
 and bestows upon his Church: may the eternal God preserve thee
 therein to the end, through his only begotten Son Jesus Christ.
 Amen.
   Be therefore assured in thy heart, my beloved brother, that
 the Lord has again received thee in mercy. Be diligent
 henceforward to guard thyself against the subtlety of Satan,
 and the wickedness of the world, to the end, that thou may not
 fall again into sin: love Christ, for many sins are forgiven
 thee.
   And you, beloved Christians, receive this your brother, with
 hearty affection; be glad that he was dead and is alive, he was
 lost and is found; rejoice with the angels of heaven, over this
 sinner who repents: count him no longer as a stranger, but as a
 fellow-citizen with the saints, and of the household of God.
   And whereas we can have no good of ourselves, let us,
 praising and magnifying the Lord Almighty, implore his mercy,
 saying:
 
 Gracious God and Father, we thank thee through Jesus Christ,
 that thou hast been pleased to give this our fellow-brother
 repentance unto life, and us cause to rejoice in his
 conversion. We beseech thee, show him thy mercy, that he may
 become more and more assured in his mind of the remission of
 his sins, and that he may receive from thence inexpressible joy
 and delight, to serve thee. And whereas he has heretofore by
 his sins offended many, grant that he may, by his conversion,
 edify many. Grant also that he may steadfastly walk in thy ways
 to the end: and may we learn from this example, that with thee
 is mercy, that thou mayest be feared; and that we, counting him
 for our brother and coheir of life eternal, may jointly serve
 thee with filial fear and obedience all the days of our life,
 through Jesus Christ, our Lord, in whose name we thus conclude
 our prayer:
   Our Father which is in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
 kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
 Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as
 we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
 deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power
 and the glory, for ever. Amen.
 
 
 Form of Ordination of the Ministers of God's Word
 
 
 The sermon and the usual prayers being finished, the Minister
 shall thus speak to the congregation:
 
 Beloved brethren, it is known unto you, that we have, at three
 different times, published the name of our brother <name>, here
 present, to learn whether any person had aught to offer
 concerning his doctrine or life, why he might not be ordained
 to the ministry of the Word. And whereas no one has appeared
 before us, who has alleged anything lawful against his person,
 we shall therefore at present, in the name of the Lord, proceed
 to his ordination; for which purpose, you <name>, and all those
 who are here present, shall first attend to a short declaration
 taken from the word of God, touching the institution and the
 office of pastors and ministers of God's Word; where, in the
 first place, you are to observe, that God our heavenly Father,
 willing to call and gather a Church from amongst the corrupt
 race of men unto life eternal, does by a particular mark of his
 favour use the ministry of men therein.
   Therefore, Paul says, that the Lord Jesus Christ has given
 some apostles and some prophets, and some evangelists, and some
 pastors and ministers; for the perfecting of the saints, for
 the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the body of
 Christ. Here we see that holy apostle among other things says
 that the pastoral office is an institution of Christ.
   What this holy office enjoins, may easily be gathered from
 the very name itself; for as it is the duty of a common
 shepherd, to feed, guide, protect and rule the flock committed
 to his charge; so it is with regard to these spiritual
 shepherds, who are set over the Church, which God calls unto
 salvation, and counts as sheep of his pasture. The pasture,
 with which these sheep are fed, is nothing else but the
 preaching of the gospel, accompanied with prayer, and the
 administration of the holy sacraments; the same word of God is
 likewise the staff with which the flock is guided and ruled,
 consequently it is evident, that the office of pastors and
 ministers of God's word is,
   First. That they faithfully explain to their flock, the Word
 of the Lord, revealed by the writings of the prophets and the
 apostles; and apply the same as well in general as in
 particular, to the edification of the hearers; instructing,
 admonishing, comforting and reproving, according to every one's
 need; preaching repentance towards God, and reconciliation with
 him through faith in Christ; and refuting with the Holy
 Scriptures, all schisms and heresies which are repugnant to the
 pure doctrine. All this is clearly signified to us in Holy
 Writ, for the Apostle Paul says, "that these labour in the
 Word"; and elsewhere he teaches, that this must be done
 "according to the measure or rule of faith"; he writes also,
 that a pastor "must hold fast and right divide the faithful and
 sincere word which is according to the doctrine": likewise, he
 that prophesieth (that is, preacheth God's Word), speaketh unto
 men to edification, and exhortation and comfort. In another
 place he proposes himself as a pattern to pastors, declaring
 that he has publicly, and from house to house, taught and
 testified repentance towards God, and faith towards our Lord
 Jesus Christ. But particularly we have a clear description of
 the office, and ministers of Gods Word (2 Cor. 5:18, 19, 20),
 where the apostle thus speaks, "And all things are of God, who
 has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given to
 us (namely, to the apostles and pastors) the ministry of
 reconciliation; to wit, that God was in Christ reconciling the
 world unto himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them,
 and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation. Now then
 we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by
 us we pray you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God."
 Concerning the refutation of false doctrine, the same apostle
 says (Titus 1:9): "That a minister must hold fast the faithful
 Word of God, that he may be able by sound doctrine, both to
 exhort and convince the gainsayers."
 
 Secondly. It is the office of the Ministers, publicly to call
 upon the name of the Lord in behalf of the whole congregation;
 for that which the apostles say, we will give ourselves
 continually to prayer and to the ministry of the word, is
 common to these pastors with the apostles; to which St. Paul
 alluding, thus speaks to Timothy: "I exhort therefore, that
 first of all supplications, prayers, intercessions, and giving
 of thanks be made for all men; for kings, and for all that are
 in authority," etc. (1 Tim. 2:1 and 2).
 
 Thirdly. Their office is to administer the sacraments, which
 the Lord has instituted as seals of his grace: as is evident
 from the command given by Christ to the apostles, and in them
 to all pastors: "Baptize them in the name of the Father, and of
 the Son, and of the Holy Ghost." Likewise: "for I have received
 of the Lord, that which also I delivered unto you, that the
 Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed," etc.
 
 Finally, it is the duty of the Ministers of the Word, to keep
 the Church of God in good discipline, and to govern it in such
 a manner as the Lord has ordained; for Christ having spoken of
 the Christian discipline, says to his apostles, whatsoever ye
 shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And Paul will
 have the ministers to know how to rule their own house, since
 they otherwise neither can provide for, nor rule the Church of
 God. This is the reason why the pastors are in Scripture called
 stewards of God, and bishops, that is, overseers and watchmen,
 for they have the oversight of the house of God, wherein they
 are conversant, to the end that everything may be transacted
 with good order and decency; and also to open and shut, with
 the keys of the kingdom of heaven, committed to them, according
 to the charge given them by God.
 From these things may be learned what a glorious work the
 ministerial office is, since so great things are effected by
 it; yea, how highly necessary it is for man's salvation, which
 is also the reason why the Lord will have such an office always
 to remain. For Christ said when he sent forth his apostles to
 officiate in his holy function, Lo, I am always with you, even
 unto the end of the world; where we see his pleasure is, that
 this holy office (for the persons to whom he here speaks, could
 not live to the end of the world) should always be maintained
 on earth. And therefore Paul exhorts Timothy, to commit that
 which he had heard of him, to faithful men, who are able to
 teach others, and he also, having ordained Titus minister,
 further commanded him to ordain elders in every city. (Titus
 1:5.)
 
 Forasmuch, therefore as we, for the maintaining of this office
 in the Church of God, are now to ordain a new minister of the
 Word, and having sufficiently spoken of the office of such
 persons, therefore you <name>, shall answer to the following
 questions, which shall be proposed to you, to the end that it
 may appear to all here present, that you are inclined to accept
 of this office as above described.
 
 First. I ask thee, whether thou feelest in thy heart that thou
 art lawfully called of God's Church, and therefore of God
 himself, to this holy ministry?
 
 Secondly. Whether thou dost believe the books of the Old and
 New Testament to be the only Word of God and the perfect
 doctrine unto salvation, and dost reject all doctrine repugnant
 thereto?
 
 Thirdly. Whether thou dost promise faithfully to discharge thy
 office, according to the same doctrine as above described, and
 to adorn it with a godly life: also, to submit thyself, in case
 thou shouldest become delinquent either in life or doctrine, to
 ecclesiastical admonition, according to the public ordinance of
 the churches?
 
   Answer. Yes, truly, with all my heart.
 
 Then the Minister, who demanded those questions of him, while
 he and other Ministers who are present, shall lay their hands
 on his head, shall say:
   God our heavenly Father, who has called thee to his holy
 ministry, enlighten thee with his Holy Spirit, strengthen thee
 with his hand, and so govern thee in thy ministry, that thou
 mayest decently and fruitfully walk therein, to the glory of
 his name, and the propagation of the kingdom of his Son Jesus
 Christ. Amen.
 
 Then the Minister shall, from the pulpit, exhort the ordained
 Minister, and the congregation in the following manner:
   "Take heed, therefore, beloved brother, and fellow-servant in
 Christ, unto thyself and to all the flock, over which the Holy
 Ghost has made thee overseer, to feed the Church of God which
 he has purchased with his own blood: love Christ and feed his
 sheep, taking the oversight of them not by constraint, but
 willingly; not for filthy lucre, but of a ready mind, neither
 as being lord over God's heritage, but an example to the flock.
 Be an example of believers, in word, in conversation, in
 charity, in spirit, in faith, in purity. Give attendance to
 reading, to exhortation, to doctrine. Neglect not the gift that
 is in thee, meditate upon those things, give thyself wholly to
 them, that thy profiting may appear to all; take heed to thy
 doctrine, and continue steadfast therein. Bear patiently all
 sufferings, and oppressions, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ,
 for in doing this thou shalt both save thyself and them that
 hear thee. And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, thou shalt
 receive a crown of glory that fadeth not away."
   "And you likewise, beloved Christians, receive this your
 minister in the Lord with all gladness, 'and hold, such in
 reputation.' Remember that God himself through him speaketh
 unto and beseecheth you. Receive the Word which he, according
 to the Scripture, shall preach unto you, 'not as the word of
 man, but (as it is in truth) the Word of God.' Let the feet of
 those that preach the gospel of peace, and bring glad tidings
 of good things, be beautiful and pleasant unto you. Obey them
 that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves; for they
 watch for your souls, as they that must give account; that they
 may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
 unprofitable for you. If you do these things, it shall come to
 pass, that the peace of God shall enter into your houses, and
 that you who receive this man in the name of a prophet, shall
 receive a prophet's reward, and through his preaching,
 believing in Christ, shall through Christ, inherit life
 eternal."
   Since no man is of himself fit for any of these things, let
 us call upon God with thanksgiving.
 
 Merciful Father, we thank thee that it pleaseth thee by the
 ministry of men, to gather a Church to thyself unto life
 eternal, from amongst the lost children of men; we bless thee
 for so graciously providing the Church in this place with a
 faithful minister; we beseech thee to qualify him daily more
 and more by the Holy Spirit, for the ministry to which thou
 hast ordained and called him; enlighten his understanding to
 comprehend thy holy Word, and give him utterance, that he may
 boldly open his mouth, to make known and dispense the mysteries
 of the gospel. Endue him with wisdom and valour, to rule the
 people aright over which he is set, and to preserve them in
 christian peace, to the end that thy Church under his
 administration and by his good example, may increase in number
 and in virtue. Grant him courage to bear the difficult ties and
 troubles which he may meet with in his ministry, that being
 strengthened by the comfort of thy Spirit, he may remain
 steadfast to the end, and be received with all faithful
 servants into the joy of his master. Give thy grace also to
 this people and Church, that they may becomingly deport
 themselves towards this their minister; that they may
 acknowledge him to be sent of thee; that they may receive his
 doctrine with all reverence, and submit themselves to his
 exhortations. To the end that they may, by his word, believing
 in Christ, be made partakers of eternal life. Hear us, O
 Father, through thy beloved Son, who has taught us to pray:
   Our Father which is in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
 kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
 Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as
 we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
 deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power
 and the glory, for ever. Amen.
 
 
 Form of Ordination of Elders and Deacons
 
 
 When ordained at the same time. But if they are ordained
 separately this form shall be used as occasion requires.
 
 Beloved Christians, you know that we have several times
 published unto you the names of our brethren here present, who
 are chosen to the office of elders and deacons in this Church,
 to the end that we might know whether any person had aught to
 allege, why they should not be ordained in their respective
 offices; and whereas no one has appeared before us, who has
 alleged anything lawful against them, we shall therefore at
 present, in the name of the Lords proceed to their ordination.
   But first, you, who are to be ordained, and all those who are
 here present, shall attend to a short declaration from the word
 of God concerning the institution and the office of elders and
 deacons.
   Of the elders is to be observed, that the word elder or
 eldest (which is taken from the Old Testament, and signifies a
 person who is placed in an honorable office of government over
 others), is applied to two sorts of persons who minister in the
 Church of Jesus Christ: for the apostle says, "the elders that
 rule well, shall be counted worthy of double honour, especially
 they who labour in the Word and doctrine." Hence it is evident
 that there were two sorts of elders in the Apostolic Church,
 the former whereof did labour in the Word and doctrine, and the
 latter did not. The first were the ministers of the Word and
 pastors, who preached the gospel and administered the
 sacraments; but the others, who did not labour in the Word, and
 still did serve in the Church, bore a particular office,
 namely, they had the oversight of the Church, and ruled the
 same with the ministers of the Word. For Paul, Rom. chap. 12,
 having spoken of the ministry of the word, and also of the
 office of distribution or deaconship, speaks afterwards
 particularly of this office, saying, "he that ruleth let him do
 it with diligence"; likewise, in another place he counts
 government among the gifts and offices which God has instituted
 in the Church: 1 Cor. 12. Thus we see that these sorts of
 ministers are added to the others who preach the gospel, to aid
 and assist them, as in the Old Testament the common Levites
 were to the priests in the service of the tabernacle, in those
 things which they could not perform alone: notwithstanding the
 offices always remained distinct one from the other. Moreover,
 it is proper that such men should be joined to the ministers of
 the Word in the government of the Church, to the end, that
 thereby all tyranny and lording may be kept out of the Church
 of God, which may sooner creep in, when the government is
 placed in the hands of one alone, or of a very few. And thus
 the ministers of the Word, together with the elders, form a
 body or assembly, being as a council of the Church,
 representing the whole Church; to which Christ alludes when he
 says, "Tell the Church" which can in no wise be understood of
 all and every member of the Church in particular, but very
 properly of those who govern the Church, out of which they are
 chosen.
 
 Therefore, in the first place, the office of elders is,
 together with the ministers of the Word, to take the oversight
 of the Church, which is committed to them, and diligently to
 look, whether every one properly deports himself in his
 confession and conversation; to admonish those who behave
 themselves disorderly, and to prevent, as much as possible, the
 sacraments from being profaned: also to act (according to the
 Christian discipline) against the impenitent, and to receive
 the penitent again into the bosom of the Church, as does not
 only appear from the above mentioned saying of Christ, but also
 from many other places of Holy Writ, as 1 Cor. chap. 5, and 2
 Cor. chap. 2, that these things are not alone intrusted to one
 or two persons, but to many who are ordained thereto.
 
 Secondly. Since the apostle enjoins, that all things shall be
 done decently and in order, amongst Christians, and that no
 other persons ought to serve in the Church o£ Christ, but those
 who are lawfully called according to the christian ordinance,
 therefore it is also the duty of the elders to pay regard to
 it, and in all occurrences, which relate to the welfare and
 good order of the Church, to be assistant with their good
 counsel and advice, to the ministers of the Word, yea, also to
 serve all Christians with advise and consolation.
 
 Thirdly. It is also the duty particularly to have regard unto
 the doctrine and conversation of the ministers of the Word, to
 the end that all things may be directed to the edification of
 the Church; and that no strange doctrine be taught, according
 to that which we read, Acts 20, where the apostle exhorts to
 watch diligently against the wolves, which might come into the
 sheepfold of Christ; for the performance of which, the elders
 are in duty bound diligently to search the Word of God, and
 continually be meditating on the mysteries of faith.
 
 Concerning the deacons: of the origin and institution of their
 office we may read, Acts 6, where we find that the apostles
 themselves did in the beginning serve the poor, "At whose feet
 was brought the price of the things that were sold: and
 distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
 But afterwards, when a murmuring arose, because the widows of
 the Grecians were neglected in the daily ministrations" men
 were chosen (by the advice of the apostles who should make the
 service of the poor their peculiar business, to the end that
 the apostles might continually give themselves to prayer, and
 the ministry of the Word. And has been continued from that time
 forward in the Church, as appears from Rom. 12, where the
 apostle, speaking of this office, says, "he that giveth, let
 him do it with simplicity." And 1 Cor. 12:28 speaking of helps,
 he means those, who are appointed in the Church to help and
 assist the poor and indigent in time of need. From which
 passage we may easily gather, what the deacon's office is
 namely, that they in the first place collect and preserve with
 the greats fidelity and diligence, the alms and goods which are
 given to the poor: yea, to do their utmost endeavours, that
 many good means be procured for the relief of the poor.
   The second part of their office consists in distribution
 wherein are not only required discretion and prudence to bestow
 the alms only on objects of charity, but also cheerfulness and
 simplicity to assist the poor with compassion and hearty
 affection: as the apostle requires, Rom., chap 12; and 2 Cor.,
 chap. 9. For which end it is very beneficial, that they do not
 only administer relief to the poor and indigent with external
 gifts, but also with comfortable words from Scripture.
   To the end therefore, beloved brethren, <name>, that every
 one may hear, that you are willing to take your respective
 offices upon you, ye shall answer to the following questions:
 
 And in the first place I ask you, both elders and deacons,
 whether you do not feel in your hearts, that ye are lawfully
 called of God's Church, and consequently of God himself, to
 these your respective holy offices?
 
 Secondly. Whether ye believe the books of the Old and New
 Testament to be the only Word of God, and the perfect doctrine
 of salvation, and do reject all doctrines repugnant thereto?
 
 Thirdly. Whether ye promise, agreeably to said doctrine,
 faithfully, according to your ability, to discharge your
 respective offices, as they are here described? ye elders in
 the government of the Church together with the ministers of the
 Word; and ye deacons in the ministration to the poor? Do ye
 also jointly promise to walk in all godliness, and to submit
 yourself, in case ye should become remiss in your duty, to the
 admonition of the Church?
 
 Upon which they shall answer: Yes.
 
 Then the Minister shall say:
   The Almighty God and Father, replenish you all with his
 grace, that ye may faithfully and fruitfully discharge your
 respective offices. Amen.
 
 The Minister shall further exhort them, and the whole
 congregation, in the following manner:
   Therefore, ye elders, be diligent in the government of the
 Church, which is committed to you, and the ministers of the
 Word. Be also, as watchmen over the house and city of God,
 faithful to admonish and to caution every one against his ruin;
 Take heed that purity of doctrine and godliness of life be
 maintained in the Church of God. And, ye deacons, be diligent
 in collecting the alms, prudent and cheerful in the
 distribution of the same: assist the oppressed, provide for the
 true widows and orphans, show liberality unto all men, but
 especially to the household of faith.
 
 Be ye all with one accord faithful in your offices, and hold
 the mystery of the faith in a pure conscience, being good
 examples unto all the people. In so doing you will purchase to
 yourselves a good degree, and great boldness in the faith,
 which is in Christ Jesus, and hereafter enter into the joy of
 our Lord. On the other hand, beloved Christians, receive these
 men as the servants of God: count the elders that rule well
 worthy of double honour, give yourselves willingly to their
 inspection and government. Provide the deacons with good means
 to assist the indigent. Be charitable, ye rich, give liberally,
 and contribute willingly. And, ye poor, be poor in spirit, and
 deport yourselves respectfully towards your benefactors, be
 thankful to them, and avoid murmuring: follow Christ, for the
 food of your souls, but not for bread. "Let him that has stolen
 (or who has been burdensome to his neighbours) steal no more:
 but rather let him labour, working with his hands the things
 which are good, that he may give to him that needeth." Each of
 you, doing these things in your respective callings, shall
 receive of the Lord, the reward of righteousness. But since we
 are unable of ourselves, let us call upon the name of the Lord
 saying:
 
 O Lord God and heavenly Father, we thank thee that it has
 pleased thee, for the better edification of thy Church, to
 ordain in it, besides the ministers of the Word, rulers and
 assistants, by whom thy Church may be preserved in peace and
 prosperity, and the indigent assisted; and that Thou hast at
 present granted us in this place, men, who are of good
 testimony, and we hope endowed with thy Spirit. We beseech
 thee, replenish them more and more with such gifts as are
 necessary, for them in their ministration; with the gifts of
 wisdom, courage, discretion, and benevolence, to the end that
 every one may, in his respective office, acquit himself as is
 becoming; the elders in taking diligent heed unto the doctrine
 and conversation, in keeping out the wolves from the sheepfold
 of thy beloved Son; and in admonishing and reproving disorderly
 persons. In like manner, the deacons in carefully receiving,
 and liberally and prudently distributing of the alms to the
 poor, and in comforting them with thy holy Word. Give grace
 both to the elders and deacons, that they may persevere in
 their faithful labour, and never become weary by reason of any
 trouble, pain or persecution of the world. Grant also
 especially thy divine grace to this people, over whom they are
 placed, that they may willingly submit themselves to the good
 exhortations of the elders, counting them worthy of honour for
 their work's sake; give also unto the rich, liberal hearts
 towards the poor, and to the poor grateful hearts towards those
 who help and serve them; to the end that every one acquitting
 himself of his duty, thy holy name may thereby be magnified,
 and the kingdom of thy Son Jesus Christ, enlarged, in whose
 name we conclude our prayers, saying:
   Our Father which is in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
 kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
 Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as
 we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
 deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power
 and the glory, for ever. Amen.
 
 
 
 Form for the Installation of Professors of Theology
 
 
 Beloved brethren, it is known unto you that our brother in the
 holy ministry, <name>, has been called by our last Synod to the
 important office of professor of theology at our Theological
 Seminary. To our joy he has accepted this call and we are now
 assembled to install him in office. For which purpose we
 request thee, brother <name>, to arise and to listen to that
 which belongs to this office, and is placed by the Lord and the
 Church in thy charge.
   Since our God, who is rich in mercy, has chosen in his great
 love a Church unto himself for the inheritance of eternal life,
 and will gather this Church through his Spirit and Word to the
 fellowship of his Son, in the unity of true faith, and to the
 increase of the knowledge of his will, so it pleases him to
 call men by his Holy Spirit, who as ministers of the Word are
 to preach the glad tidings of salvation among those who already
 belong to the Church and among those outside, who are yet
 without the knowledge of God's ways.
   The first messengers of peace in the days of the New
 Testament were immediately taught by our Lord Jesus Christ, and
 were by him personally trained and sent. After the outpouring
 of the Holy Spirit he gave them great diversities of
 extraordinary gifts and knowledge of the mysteries of salvation
 of sinners and the up building of saints. Because these
 extraordinary methods, however, lasted only as long as the Lord
 judged them to be necessary for the founding of his Church
 among the nations, the necessity was soon felt of training
 youths and men for the holy ministry under the ordinary
 dispensation of the Spirit by the regular methods of education.
 And this especially in virtue of what Paul wrote in 2 Tim. 2:2,
 "And the things which thou hast heard from me among many
 witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be
 able to teach others also." The Apostle here points to what he
 had himself done and what he required of his disciple Timothy.
   In obedience to this apostolic direction this training was
 originally done by learned and capable overseers of the Church.
 Later the schools of Alexandria, Antioch, and other important
 cities were especially engaged in this work. And when towards
 the end of the middle ages and in the sixteenth and seventeenth
 centuries universities arose in various places, theology was
 not incorporated merely as a faculty with other faculties, but
 usually recognized as Queen of Sciences. This was the more
 easily done because the Church. both Roman Catholic and
 Protestant, exercised authority over or concerned itself with
 everything.
   As long as a university is founded on the basis of Holy
 Scripture, accepts the confession of a certain denomination,
 and this denomination has part control in the appointing of
 professors of theology, it cannot be disapproved of that future
 ministers of the Word should receive their education at such an
 institution.
   Since, however, Paul in Rom. 3:2 expressly declares that the
 Church of the Old Dispensation, and therefore also the Church
 of the New Dispensation, was given the special prerogative that
 to her were intrusted the oracles of God, it follows therefore
 that the Church has a divine mission to proclaim the word of
 God, to collect from the Word of God her standards of faith, to
 study theology according to these words, and further to advance
 what is in direct connection with this study.
   Conscious of this calling our Church has also established a
 Theological School and called the reverend brother <name> to
 devote his talents to this School.
   In behalf of our Church the Curators charge thee, esteemed
 brother, with the task of instructing and establishing in the
 knowledge of God's Word the students who hope once to minister
 in his Church. Expound to them the mysteries of the faith;
 caution them in regard to the errors and heresies of the old,
 but especially of the new day; seek to explain how they not
 alone as teachers are to instruct but also as pastors are to
 shepherd the flock of the Lord. Assist in maintaining order and
 discipline among the disciples, that our Seminary may continue
 to enjoy the respect, the support, the appreciation, the love
 and the prayer of the Church. Be a good example to the
 students, that they may not only profit from thy learning, but
 also find in thee a living illustration of the power and
 practice of true godliness.
   Be engaged in all of this according to the measure of the
 gifts God gave thee, in dependence on the Lord's help and the
 light of the Holy Spirit.
   And that it may now publicly appear that thou, highly
 esteemed brother, art thus disposed, thou art to answer the
 following questions:
 
 First. I ask thee, dost thou feel in thy heart that thou art
 lawfully called of God's Church and therefore of God himself to
 this office?
 
 Secondly. Dost thou believe the books of the Old and New
 Testament to be the only Word of God? Dost thou reject all
 doctrine repugnant thereto, and dost thou accept the doctrinal
 standards of this Christian Church as the truest expression of
 the doctrine of salvation?
 
 Thirdly. Dost thou promise faithfully to discharge thy office
 according to the same doctrine above described, and to adorn it
 with a godly life?
 
 Fourthly. Dost thou promise to submit thyself, in case thou
 shouldest become delinquent, either in life or doctrine, to the
 ordinance of the Church, and if necessary, to Church
 discipline?
 
 Answer: Yes, with all my heart.
 
 
 
 Form or Ordination of Missionaries
 
 
 Beloved in our Lord and Saviour and all here present. It is
 known to you that our brother <name>, called by the ... as
 missionary minister of the Word among the Heathen (Dispersed),
 (and recently examined by the Classis of ...) is now to be
 publicly ordained (installed) as missionary. We, therefore,
 request thee, beloved brother <name>, to arise and to attend to
 a short declaration touching the office of missionary ministers
 of the Word.
   Since our God, according to his infinite mercy, has chosen a
 Church unto everlasting life, and gathers it by his blessed
 gospel, out of every nation, and of all tribes and peoples and
 tongues, unto the fellowship of his Son, in unity of the true
 faith, therefore our risen Saviour has ordained an office and
 has called men, to carry the message of salvation to all
 peoples, commanding his apostles, and in them all lawful
 ministers of the Word: "Go ye into all the world, and preach
 the gospel to every creature." Mark 16:15. For he that ascended
 far above all the heavens, that he might fulfill all things,
 gave some to be apostles; and some prophets; and some
 evangelists; and some pastors and teachers; for the perfecting
 of the saints, unto the work of ministering, unto the building
 up of the body of Christ. And the Apostles, responding to this,
 went forth into the world declaring the whole counsel of God,
 particularly repentance, and remission of sins, through faith
 in Jesus Christ, testifying: "for God so loved the world, that
 He gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him
 should not perish, but have eternal life." John 3:16. "But all
 things are of God who reconciled us to himself through Christ,
 and gave unto us the ministry of reconciliation: to wit, that
 God was in Christ reconciling the world unto himself, not
 reckoning unto them their trespasses; and has committed unto us
 the word of reconciliation. We are ambassadors, therefore, on
 behalf of Christ, as though God were entreating by us: we
 beseech you on behalf of Christ, be ye reconciled to God." 2
 Cor. 5.
   Without this word of reconciliation, faith in Christ and
 consequently salvation, is and remains forever impossible, for
 Holy Scripture says, Acts 4:12: "And in none other is there
 salvation: for neither is there any other name under heaven,
 that is given among men, wherein we must be saved"; and
 elsewhere: Rom. 10:14, 15, 17: "How shall they believe in him
 of whom they have not heard? and how shall they hear without a
 preacher? and how shall they preach, except they be sent? So
 then, faith comes by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God."
   Although all ministers of the Word have in common, that to
 them is committed the preaching of the Gospel, the
 administration of the Sacraments, the government of the Church,
 and the maintenance of christian discipline, yea, all, that,
 according to the Word of God belongs to the office of pastor
 and teacher: and although from the difference of field of
 labour no difference is resulting, concerning office, authority
 or dignity, since all possess the same mission, the same office
 and the same authority, yet not withstanding this, it is
 necessary that some labour in the congregations already
 established, while others are called and sent to preach the
 Gospel to those without, in order to bring them to Christ. And
 let each man abide in that calling wherein he was called by the
 Church of God and consequently by God himself and whereunto
 each has received gifts, until it pleases the Lord to lead him
 along a lawful way to a different field of labour.
 
 Unto the Heathen
 
 That unto the Heathen also these glad tidings must be brought
 appears plainly from Matt. 28:19, "Go ye therefore, and teach
 all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of
 the Son, and of the Holy Ghost; teaching them to observe all
 things whatsoever I have commanded you."
   The same was revealed to Peter by showing him as it were a
 great sheet let down by four corners upon the earth, wherein
 were all manner of beasts, and thereupon commanding him to go
 down to the Gentile Cornelius, saying: "Arise, and get thee
 down, and go with them, nothing doubting; for I have sent
 them," Acts 10:20. Likewise he spoke to Paul in a vision in the
 temple: "Depart: for I will send thee forth far hence unto the
 Gentiles." Acts 22:21.
   This divine charge was also carried out by the church of
 Antioch, when they, after fasting and prayer, laid their hands
 upon Barnabas and Saul and sent them away to preach the gospel
 also unto the Gentiles, Acts 13. And when they on their first
 missionary journey had arrived at Antioch in Pisidia they
 testified to the contradicting Jews: "Lo, we turn to the
 Gentiles. For so has the Lord commanded us, saying: I have set
 thee for a light of the Gentiles; that thou shouldest be for
 salvation unto the uttermost part of the earth."
   And besides all this it is evident that the work of missions
 is the task of the Church since the Lord Jesus himself calls
 his Church the salt of the earth, and says: "Ye are the light
 of the world. A city on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men
 light a lamp, and put it under the bushel, but on the stand."
 Matt. 5.
 
 Unto the Dispersed
 
 That unto the Dispersed also these glad tidings must be brought
 is plainly inferred from what God says in Ezekiel 34:11-16:
 "For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I myself, even I, will
 search for my sheep, and will seek them out. As a shepherd
 seeketh out his flock in the day that he is among his sheep
 that are scattered abroad, so will I seek out my sheep; and I
 will deliver them out of all places whither they have been
 scattered in the cloudy and dark day. And I will bring them out
 from the peoples, and gather them from the countries, and will
 bring them into their own land; and I will feed them upon the
 mountains of Israel, by the watercourses, and in all the
 inhabited places of the country. I will feed them with good
 pasture, and upon the mountains of the height of Israel shall
 their fold be: there shall they lie down in a good fold, and on
 fat pasture shall they feed upon the mountains of Israel. I
 myself will feed my sheep, and I will cause them to lie down,
 saith the Lord God. I will seek that which was lost, and will
 bring again that which was driven away, and will bind up that
 which was broken, and will strengthen that which was sick. I
 will feed them in judgment."
   That the Lord does this by means of his servants, is clearly
 shown by the way wherein God, in the same chapter, rebukes the
 unfaithful shepherds: "Neither have ye brought again that which
 was driven away," and expresses his holy indignation because:
 "My sheep wandered through all the mountains, and upon every
 high hill: yea, my sheep were scattered upon all the face of
 the earth; and there was none that did search or seek after
 them." Ezek. 34:4, 6.
   The same also follows from the fact that Jesus who Himself
 was sent "to the lost sheep of the House of Israel," calls the
 Church the salt of the earth, while besides all this, the
 example of the Apostle Paul teaches us plainly that it is our
 high calling to bring the bread of life to our dispersed
 brethren after the flesh everywhere, and therefore certainly
 first of all in our own country, to gather them, if possible,
 as congregations of our Lord.
 
 And since thou, beloved brother, are now called and are now
 being sent to labour among the Heathen (Dispersed), thou are to
 consider which important duties, are thereby devolving upon
 thee:
   In the first place thou are to bring to their attention by
 all fit and lawful means, the glad tidings that Jesus Christ
 has come into the world to save sinners. All thine actions, thy
 speaking and thy silence, yea, all thine influence is to
 cooperate to recommend the gospel of Christ. Let thy
 conversation be without covetousness; abhor that which is evil;
 cleave to that which is good, that thou mayest be able to say
 with the Apostle Paul, 1 Cor. 9: 19, 22, 27: "For though I was
 free from all men I brought myself under bondage to all, that I
 might gain the more. ... I am become all things to all men,
 that I may by all means save some. I buffet my body, and bring
 it into bondage: lest by any means, after that I have preached
 to others, I myself should be rejected."
   Secondly, thou are holden, if it pleases Gods to make thy
 work fruitful unto the gathering of a church, to administer the
 Sacrament of Holy Baptism according to the institution of the
 Lord and the requirement of the covenant.
   Furthermore, thou are called wherever it is necessary and
 possible to ordain elders and deacons even as Paul charged
 Titus, chapter 1:5, saying; "For this cause left I thee in
 Crete, that thou shouldest set in order the things that were
 wanting, and appoint elders in every city, as I gave thee
 charge." But lay hands hastily on no man.
   Moreover, there is committed unto thee, as minister of Christ
 and steward of the mysteries of God, the administering of the
 Holy Supper of the Lord according to the institution of Christ.
   Besides this, there is commended unto thee the maintaining of
 christian discipline in the midst of the congregation, by
 faithful use of the keys of the Kingdom, as our Lord Jesus has
 spoken: "Go, show him his fault, between thee and him alone,"
 etc. And afterwards: "Verily I say unto you, what things soever
 ye shall bind on earth, shall be bound in heaven."
   And finally, beloved brother, be a faithful servant of Jesus
 Christ, and a careful shepherd of the flock. "Preach the Word,
 be urgent in season, out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort,
 with all longsuffering and teaching, ... be an example to them
 that believe, in word, in manner of life, in love, in faith, in
 purity." ... "Give heed to reading, to exhortations, to
 teaching. Neglect not the gift that is in thee." ... "Be
 diligent in these things; give thyself wholly to them; that thy
 progress may be manifest unto all. Take heed to thyself, and to
 thy teaching. Continue in these things; for in doing this thou
 shalt save both thyself and them that hear thee." (2 Tim. 4:2
 and 1 Tim. 4:12b, 16.)
 
 And that now everyone present may hear, beloved brother, that
 thou art willing, and ready to undertake the ministry of the
 Word among the Heathen (Dispersed), thou art requested to
 answer sincerely the following questions:
 
 First. I ask thee whether thou feelest in thy heart that thou
 art lawfully called of God's Church and therefore of God
 himself, to this holy ministry?
 
 Secondly. Whether thou dost believe the books of the Old and
 New Testament to be the only Word of God, and the perfect
 doctrine unto salvation, and dost reject all doctrines
 repugnant thereto?
 
 Thirdly. Whether thou dost promise faithfully to discharge
 thine office, according to the same doctrine as above
 described, and to adorn it with a godly life; also, to submit
 thyself, in case thou should become delinquent either in life
 or doctrine, to ecclesiastical admonition, according to the
 public ordinance of the churches?
 
   Answer: Yes; truly, with all my heart.
 
 Then the Minister, who demanded those questions of him, while
 he and other Ministers who are present, shall lay their hands
 on his head, shall say:
   "Go then, beloved brother, and teach all nations, baptizing
 them in the name of the Father and of the Son, and of the Holy
 Ghost. God our heavenly Father, who has called thee to his holy
 ministry, enlighten thee with his Holy Spirit, strengthen thee
 with his hand and so govern thee in thy ministry, that thou
 mayest do gently and fruitfully walk therein, to the glory of
 his Name, and the propagation of the Kingdom of his Son Jesus
 Christ." Amen.
 
 
 Form for the Confirmation of Marriage before the Church
 
 
 Whereas married persons are generally, by reason of sin,
 subject to many troubles and afflictions; to the end that you
 <name> and <name>, who desire to have your marriage bond
 publicly confirmed, here in the name of God, before this
 Church, may also be assured in your hearts of the certain
 assistance of God in your afflictions, hear therefore from the
 Word of God, how honorable the marriage state is, and that it
 is an institution of God, which is pleasing to him. Wherefore
 he also will (as he has promised) bless and assist the married
 persons, and on the contrary, judge and punish whoremongers and
 adulterers.
 
 1. In the first place you are to know, that God our Father,
 after he had created heaven and earth, and all that in them is,
 made man in his own image and likeness, that he should have
 dominion over the beasts of the field, over the fish of the
 sea, and over the fowls of the air. And after he had created
 man, he said, "It is not good that man should be alone, I will
 make him a help meet for him. And the Lord caused a deep sleep
 to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs,
 and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib which the
 Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her
 unto the man. And Adam said, this is now bone of my bone, and
 flesh of any flesh: she shall be called woman, because she was
 taken out of man. Therefore shall a man leave his father, and
 his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife, and they two shall
 be one flesh." Therefore ye are not to doubt, but that the
 married state is pleasing to the Lord, since he made unto Adam
 his wife, brought and gave her himself to him to be his wife;
 witnessing thereby that he does yet as with his hand bring unto
 every man his wife. For this lesson the Lord Jesus Christ did
 also highly honour it with his presence, gifts and miracles, in
 Cana of Galilee, to show thereby that this holy state ought to
 be kept honorably by all, and that he will aid and protect
 married persons, even when they are least deserving it.
   But that you may live godly in this state, you must know the
 reasons, wherefore God has instituted the same. The first
 reason is, that each faithfully assist the other, in all things
 that belong to this life, and a better.
   Secondly. That they bring up the children, which the Lord
 shall give them, in the true knowledge and fear of God, to his
 glory, and their salvation.
   Thirdly. That each of them, avoiding all uncleanness and evil
 lusts, may live with a good and quiet conscience.
   For, to avoid fornication, let every man have his own wife,
 and every woman her own husband; insomuch that all, who are
 come to their years, and have not the gift of continence, are
 bound by the command of God, to enter into the marriage state,
 with knowledge and consent of parents, or guardians and
 friends; so that the temple of God, which is our body, may not
 be defiled; for, whosoever defileth the temple of God, him
 shall God destroy.
 
 2. Next, you are to know, how each is bound to behave
 respectively towards the other, according to the word of God.
   First. You, who are the bridegroom, must know, that God has
 set you to be the head of your wife, that you, according to
 your ability, shall lead her with discretion; instructing,
 comforting, protecting her, as the head rules the body; yea, as
 Christ is the head, wisdom, consolation and assistance to his
 Church. Besides, you are to love your wife as your own body, as
 Christ has loved his Church: you shall not be bitter against
 her, but dwell with her as a man of understanding, giving
 honour to the wife as the weaker vessel, considering that ye
 are joint heirs of the grace of life, that your prayers be not
 hindered. And since it is God's command, "that the man shall
 eat his bread in the sweat of his face," therefore you are to
 labour diligently and faithfully, in the calling wherein God
 has set you, that you may maintain your household honestly, and
 likewise have something to give to the poor.
   In like manner, must you, who are the bride, know how you are
 to carry yourself towards your husband, according to the Word
 of God. You are to love your lawful husband, to honour and fear
 him, as also to be obedient unto him, in all lawful things, as
 to your Lord, as the body is obedient to the head, and the
 Church to Christ. You shall not exercise any dominion over your
 husband, but be silent: for Adam was first created, and then
 Eve, to be a help to Adam; and after the fall, God said to Eve,
 and in her to all women, "your will shall be subject to your
 husband." You shall not resist this ordinance of God, but be
 obedient to the word of God, and follow the examples of godly
 women, who trusted in God, and were subject to their husbands;
 "as Sarah was obedient to Abraham, calling him her lord": you
 shall also be a help to your husband in all good and lawful
 things, looking to your family, and walking in all honesty and
 virtue, without worldly pride, that you may give an example to
 others of modesty.
 
 Wherefore you <name> and you <name>, having now understood that
 God has instituted marriage, and what he commands you therein;
 are you willing thus to behave yourselves in this holy state,
 as you here do confess before this christian assembly, and
 desirous that you be confirmed in the same?
   Answer. Yes.
 
 Whereupon the Minister shall say:
   I take you all, who are met here to witness, that there is
 brought no lawful impediment.
 
 Further to the married persons.
   Since then it is fit that you be furthered in this your work,
 the Lord God confirm your purpose, which he has given you; and
 your beginning be in the name of the Lord, who made heaven and
 earth.
 Hereupon they shall join hands together, and the Minister speak
 first to the bridegroom.
   <name> Do you acknowledge here before God and this his holy
 Church, that you have taken, and do take to your lawful wife,
 <name>, here present, promising her never to forsake her; to
 love her faithfully, to maintain her, as a faithful and pious
 husband is bound to do to his lawful wife; that you will live
 homily with her; keeping faith and truth to her in all things
 according to the holy gospel?
   Answer: Yes.
 
 Afterwards to the bride.
   <name> Do you acknowledge here before God, and this his holy
 Church, that you have taken, and do take to your lawful
 husband, <name>, here present, promising to be obedient to him,
 to serve and assist him, never to forsake him, to live homily
 with him, keeping faith and truth to him in all things, as a
 pious and faithful wife is bound to her lawful husband
 according to the holy gospel?
   Answer. Yes.
 
 Then the Minister shall say:
   The Father of all mercies, who of his grace has called you to
 this holy state of marriage, bind you in true love and
 faithfulness, and grant you his blessing. Amen.
 
 Hear now from the Gospel, how firm the bond of marriage is, as
 described, Matt. 19:3-9:
   "The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
 unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every
 cause? And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read,
 that he which made them at the beginning made them male and
 female, and said, For this cause shall a man leave father and
 mother, and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be
 one flesh? Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh.
 What therefore God has joined together, let not man put
 asunder. They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give
 a writing of divorcement, and to put her away? He saith unto
 them, Moses because of the hardness of your hearts suffered you
 to put away your wives; but from the beginning it was not so.
 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
 it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
 adultery: and whose marrieth her which is put away does commit
 adultery."
   Believe these words of Christ, and be certain and assured,
 that your Lord God has joined you together in this holy state.
 You are therefore to receive whatever befalls you therein, with
 patience and thanksgiving, as from the hand of God, and thus
 all things will turn to your advantage and salvation. Amen
 
 Prayer
 
 Almighty God, Thou, who dost manifest thy goodness and wisdom
 in all thy works and ordinances; and from the beginning hast
 said, that it is not good that man be alone and therefore hast
 created him a help meet to be with him, and ordained that they
 who were two should be one, and who dost also punish all
 impurity; we pray thee, since Thou hast called and united these
 two persons in the holy state of marriage, that Thou wilt give
 them thy Holy Spirit, so that they in true love and firm faith
 may live holy according to thy divine will and resist all evil.
 Wilt Thou also bless them as Thou hast blessed the believing
 fathers, thy friends and faithful servants, Abraham, Isaac and
 Jacob; in order that they as coheirs of the covenant which Thou
 hast established with these fathers, may bring up their
 children, which Thou wilt be pleased to give them, in the fear
 of the Lord, to the honour of thy holy name, to the edification
 of thy Church and to the extension of the holy gospel. Hear us,
 Father of all mercy, for the sake of Jesus Christ, thy beloved
 Son, our Lord, in whose name we conclude our prayer:
 
   Our Father which is in heaven. Hallowed be thy name. Thy
 kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven.
 Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts, as
 we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into temptation, but
 deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power
 and the glory, for ever. Amen.
 
 Hearken now to the promise of God, from Psalm 128: "Blessed is
 every one that feareth the Lord, that walketh in his ways. For
 thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou be,
 and it shall be well with thee. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful
 vine by the sides of thine house; thy children like olive
 plants round about thy table. Behold, that thus shall the man
 be blessed that feareth the Lord. The Lord shall bless thee out
 of Zion: and thou shalt see the good of Jerusalem all the days
 of thy life; yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and
 peace upon Israel." The Lord our God replenish you with his
 grace, and grant that ye may long live together in all
 godliness and holiness. Amen.
