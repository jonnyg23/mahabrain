 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Mary again questioneth Jesus.</font></span>It came to pass, when Jesus had finished speaking these words unto his disciples, that Mary Magdalene came forward, kissed the feet of Jesus and said unto him: "My Lord, bear with me and be not wroth with me, if I question thee; but have mercy upon us, my Lord, and reveal unto us all things on which we shall question thee. Now, therefore, my Lord, how doth the First Mystery possess twelve mysteries, [and] the Ineffable possess a one and only mystery?"</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the three mysteries and five mysteries.</font></span>Jesus answered and said unto her: "Indeed it possesseth a one and only mystery, yet that mystery constituteth three mysteries, although</p>  
 <p><a name="page_198"><font size="1" color="green">p. 198</font></a></p>  
 <p>it is the one and only mystery; but the type of every one of them is different. And moreover it constituteth five mysteries, although it is a one and only [one]; but the type of every one is different. So that these five mysteries are alike with one another in the mystery |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>237</b>.</font></span> of the kingdom in the inheritances of the Light; but the type of each of them is different. And their kingdom is higher and more exalted than the whole kingdom of the twelve mysteries together of the First Mystery; but they are not alike in the kingdom [with the one and only mystery] of the First Mystery in the Light-kingdom.</p>  
 <p>"In like manner also the three mysteries are not [?] alike in the Light-kingdom; but the type of every one of them is different. And they themselves also are not alike in the kingdom with the one and only mystery of the First Mystery in the Light-kingdom; and the type of every one of the three of them, and the type of the configuration of each of them, is different from one another.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the first mystery.</font></span>"The first [mystery of the First Mystery],--if thou accomplishest its mystery altogether and standest and accomplishest it finely in all its figures, then dost thou come straightway out of thy body, become a great light-stream and pass through all the regions of the rulers and all the regions of the Light, while all are in fear of that soul, until it cometh to the region of its kingdom.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the second mystery.</font></span>"The second mystery of the First Mystery, on the other hand,--|<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>238</b>.</font></span> if thou accomplishest it finely in all its figures,--the man, therefore, who shall accomplish its mystery, if he speaketh that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_199"><font size="1" color="green">p. 199</font></a></p>  
 <p>mystery over the head of any man who goeth forth out of the body, and he speaketh it into his two ears, if indeed the man who goeth forth out of the body hath received mysteries for the second time and is sharing in the word of truth,--amēn, I say unto you: That man, if he goeth forth out of the body of matter, then will his soul become a great light-stream and pass through all the regions, until it cometh to the kingdom of that mystery.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of its efficacy for the uninitiated.</font></span>"But if that man hath received no mysteries and is not sharing in the words of truth,--if he who accomplisheth that mystery, speaketh that mystery over the head of a man who cometh forth out of the body and who hath received no mysteries of the Light, and shareth not in the words of truth,--amēn, I say unto you: That man, if he cometh forth out of the body, will be judged in no region of the rulers, nor can he be chastized in any region at all, nor will the fire touch him, because of the great mystery of the Ineffable which is with him.</p>  
 <p>"And they will hasten quickly and hand him over one to another in turn and lead him from region to region and |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>239</b>.</font></span> from order to order, until they bring him before the Virgin of Light, while all the regions are in fear of the mystery and the sign of the kingdom of the Ineffable which is with him.</p>  
 <p>"And if they bring him before the Virgin of Light, then the Virgin of Light will see the sign of the mystery of the kingdom of the Ineffable which is with him; the Virgin of Light marvelleth and proveth him, but suffereth them not to bring him to the Light, until he accomplisheth the total</p>  
 <p><a name="page_200"><font size="1" color="green">p. 200</font></a></p>  
 <p>citizenship of the light of that mystery, that is the purities of the renunciation of the world and also of the total matter therein.</p>  
 <p>"The Virgin of Light sealeth him with a higher seal, which is this [ . . .? ], and letteth him in that month in which he hath come out of the body of matter, light down into a body which will be righteous and find the godhead in truth and the higher mysteries, so that he may inherit them and inherit the Light eternal, which is the gift of the second mystery of the First Mystery of the Ineffable.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the third mystery.</font></span>"The third mystery of that Ineffable on the other hand,--the man indeed who shall accomplish that mystery, not only if he [himself] cometh forth out of the body, will he inherit the kingdom of the mystery, but if he complete that mystery and accomplish it with |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>240</b>.</font></span> all its figures, that is if he go through with that mystery and accomplish it finely and pronounce the name of that mystery<span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of its efficacy.</font></span> over a man who cometh forth out of the body and hath known that mystery,--let the former have delayed or rather not have delayed,--one who is in the dire chastisements of the rulers and in their dire judgments and their manifold fires,--amēn, I say unto you: The man who hath come forth out of the body,--if the name of this mystery is pronounced on his behalf, they will hasten quickly to bring him over and hand him over one to another, until they bring him before the Virgin of Light. And the Virgin of Light will seal him with a higher. seal, which is this [ . . .?], and in that month will she let him light down into the righteous body which will find the godhead in truth and the higher mystery, so that</p>  
 <p><a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></a></p>  
 <p>he inherit the Light-kingdom. This, therefore, is the gift of the third mystery of the Ineffable.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the three and five mysteries.</font></span>"Now, therefore, every one who shall receive one of the five mysteries of the Ineffable,--if he cometh forth out of the body and inheriteth up to the region of that mystery, then is the kingdom of those five mysteries higher than the kingdom of the twelve mysteries of the First Mystery, and it is higher than all the mysteries |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>241</b>.</font></span> which are below them. But those five mysteries of the Ineffable are alike with one another in their kingdom, yet are they not alike with the three mysteries of the Ineffable.</p>  
 <p>"He on the other hand who receiveth of the three mysteries of the Ineffable, if he cometh forth out of the body, will inherit up to the kingdom of that mystery. And those three mysteries are alike with one another in the kingdom and they are higher and more exalted than the five mysteries of the Ineffable in the kingdom, but they are not alike with the one and only mystery of the Ineffable.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the mysteries of the three spaces</font></span>"He on the other hand who receiveth the one and only mystery of the Ineffable, will inherit the region of the whole kingdom according to its whole glory, as I have already told you at another time. And every one who shall receive the mystery which is in the space of the universe of the Ineffable, and all the other mysteries which are united in the Limbs of the Ineffable, concerning which I have not yet spoken unto you, and concerning their expansion and the manner of their setting-up and the type of every one, how it is and wherefor it is named the Ineffable or wherefor it standeth expanded with all its</p>  
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Limbs and how many Limbs are in it and all its economies, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>242</b>.</font></span> of which I will not tell you now, but when I come to the expansion of the universe I will tell you all severally,--to wit, its expansions and its description, how it is, and the aggregation [?] of all its Limbs, which belong to the economy of the One and Only, the unapproachable God in truth,--up to what region, therefore, every one shall receive the mysteries in the space of the Ineffable, up to that region will he inherit up to which he hath received. And those of the whole region of the space of that Ineffable give no answers in that region, nor give they apologies, nor give they tokens, for they are without tokens and they have no receivers, but they pass through all the regions, until they come to the region of the kingdom of the mystery which they have received.</p>  
 <p>"In like manner also those who shall receive mysteries in the second space, they have no answers nor apologies, for they are without tokens in that world, which is the space of the first mystery of the First Mystery.</p>  
 <p>"And those of the third space, which is without, which is the third space from without [? within],--every region in that space hath |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>243</b>.</font></span> its receivers and its explanations and its apologies and its tokens, which I will one day tell you when I come to speak of that mystery, that is when I shall have told you of the expansion of the universe.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the reign of a thousand years of the Light.</font></span>"Albeit at the dissolution of the universe, that is when the number of the perfect souls is completed and the mystery [through] which the universe altogether hath risen, is completed, I</p>  
 <p><a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></a></p>  
 <p>will pass a thousand years according to the years of the Light, being king over all the emanations of the Light and over the whole number of the perfect souls who have received all mysteries."</p>
