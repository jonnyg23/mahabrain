 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Gabriēl and Michaēl are summoned to help Pistis Sophia.</font></span>The First Mystery again continued and said: "It came to pass, therefore, that the power which had come out of the Height, that is I, in that my Father sent me to save Pistis Sophia out of the chaos, [that] I, therefore, and also the power which did go from me, and the soul which I had received from Sabaōth, the Good,--they drew towards one another and become a single light-stream, which shone very exceedingly. I called down Gabriēl and Michaēl out of the æons, at the command of my Father, the First Mystery which looketh within, and I gave unto them the light-stream and let them go down into the chaos |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>129</b>.</font></span> to help Pistis Sophia and to take the light-powers, which the emanations of Self-willed had taken from her, from them and give them to Pistis Sophia.</p>  
 <p>"And straightway, when they had brought down the light-stream into the chaos, it shone most exceedingly in the whole of the chaos, and spread itself over all their regions. And when the emanations of Self-willed had seen the great light of that stream, they were terror-stricken one with the other. And that stream drew forth out of them all the light-powers which they had taken from Pistis Sophia, and the emanations of Self-willed could not dare to lay hold of that light-stream</p>  
 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="green">p. 109</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the dark chaos; nor could they lay hold of it with the art of Self-willed, who ruleth over the emanations.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The light-stream restoreth the light-powers to Sophia.</font></span>"And Gabriēl and Michaēl led the light-stream over the body of the matter of Pistis Sophia and poured into her all the light-powers which they had taken from her. And the body of her matter became shining throughout, and all the powers also in her, whose light they had taken away, took light and ceased to lack their light, for they got their light which had been taken from them, because the light was given them through me. And Michaēl and Gabriēl, who ministered and had brought the light-stream |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>130</b>.</font></span> into the chaos, will give them the mysteries of the Light; it is they to whom the light-stream was entrusted, which I have given unto them and brought into the chaos. And Michaēl and Gabriēl have taken no light for themselves from the lights of Sophia, which they had taken from the emanations of Self-willed.</p>  
 <p>"It came to pass then, when the light-stream had ingathered into Pistis Sophia all her light-powers, which it had taken from the emanations of Self-willed, that she became shining throughout; and the light-powers also in Pistis Sophia, which the emanations of Self-willed had not taken, became joyful again and filled themselves with light. And the lights which were poured into Pistis Sophia, quickened the body of her matter, in which no light was present, and which was on the point of perishing or perished. And they raised up all her powers which were on the point of being dissolved. And they took unto themselves a light-power and became again as they</p>  
 <p><a name="page_110"><font size="1" color="green">p. 110</font></a></p>  
 <p>were before, and they increased again in their sense of the Light. And all the light-powers of Sophia knew themselves mutually through my light-stream and were saved through the light of that stream. <span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The light-stream, having accomplished its purpose, departeth from Sophia.</font></span>And my light-stream, when. it had taken away the lights from the emanations of Self-willed, which they had taken away from |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>131</b>.</font></span> Pistis Sophia, poured them into Pistis Sophia, and turned itself about and went up out of the chaos."</p>  
 <p>When then the First Mystery said this to the disciples, that it had befallen Pistis Sophia in the chaos, he answered and said unto them: "Understand ye in what manner I discourse with you?"</p>
