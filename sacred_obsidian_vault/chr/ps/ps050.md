 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The repentance of Sophia is not yet accepted. She is mocked by the æons.</font></span>Jesus continued again in the discourse and said unto his disciples: "It came to pass, when Pistis Sophia had finished uttering the sixth repentance for the forgiveness of her transgression, that she turned again to the height, to see if her sins were forgiven her, and to see whether they would lead her up out of the chaos. But by commandment of the First Mystery not yet was she hearkened to, so that her sin should be forgiven and she should be led up out of the chaos. When then she had turned to the height to see whether her repentance were accepted from her, she saw all the rulers of the twelve æons mocking at her and rejoicing over her because her repentance was not accepted from her. When then she saw that they mocked at her, she grieved exceedingly and lifted up her voice to the height in her seventh repentance, saying:</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">The seventh repentance of Sophia.</font></span>"'1. O Light, I have lifted up my power unto thee, my Light.</p>  
 <p>"'2. On thee have I had faith. Let me not be scorned; let not the rulers of the twelve æons, who hate me, rejoice over me.</p>  
 <p>"'3. For all who have faith in thee shall not be put to shame. Let them who have taken</p>  
 <p><a name="page_65"><font size="1" color="green">p. 65</font></a></p>  
 <p>away my power, remain in darkness; and let them not get from it any profit, but let it be taken away from them. |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>78</b>.</font></span></p>  
 <p>"'4. O Light, show me thy ways, and I shall be saved in them; and show me thy paths, whereby I shall be saved out of the chaos.</p>  
 <p>"'5. And guide me in thy light, and let me know, O Light, that thou art my saviour. On thee will I trust the whole of my time.</p>  
 <p>"'6. Give heed that thou save me, O Light, for thy mercy endureth for ever.</p>  
 <p>"'7. As to my transgression, which I have committed from the beginning in my ignorance, put it not to my account, O Light, but rather save me through thy great mystery of the forgiveness of sins because of thy goodness, O Light.</p>  
 <p>"'8. For good and sincere is the Light. For this cause will it grant me my way, to be saved out of my transgression;</p>  
 <p>"'9. And for my powers, which are diminished through the fear of the material emanations of Self-willed, will it draw near after its commandment, and will teach my powers, which are diminished because of the merciless, its gnosis.</p>  
 <p>"'10. For all gnoses of the Light are saving means and are mysteries for all who seek the regions of its Inheritance and its mysteries.</p>  
 <p>"'11. For the sake of the mystery of thy name, O Light, forgive my transgression, for it is great.</p>  
 <p>"'12. To every one who trusteth in the Light it will give the mystery which suiteth him;</p>  
 <p>"'13. And his soul will abide in the regions of the Light and his power will inherit |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>79</b>.</font></span> the Treasury of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"'14. The Light giveth power to them who</p>  
 <p><a name="page_66"><font size="1" color="green">p. 66</font></a></p>  
 <p>have faith in it; and the name of its mystery belongeth to those who trust in it. And it will show them the region of the Inheritance, which is in the Treasury of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"'15. But I have ever had faith in the Light, for it will save my feet from the bonds of the darkness.</p>  
 <p>"'16. Give heed unto me, O Light, and save me, for they have taken away my name from me in the chaos.</p>  
 <p>"'17. Because of all the emanations my afflictions and my oppression have become exceedingly manifold. Save me out of my transgression and this darkness.</p>  
 <p>"'18. And look upon the grief of my oppression and forgive my transgression.</p>  
 <p>"'19. Give heed to the rulers of the twelve æons, who have hated me through jealousy.</p>  
 <p>"'20. Watch over my power and save me, and let me not remain in this darkness, for I have had faith in thee.</p>  
 <p>"'21. And they have made of me a great fool for having had faith in thee, O Light.</p>  
 <p>"'22. Now, therefore, O Light, save my powers from the emanations of Self-willed, by whom I am oppressed.'</p>  
 <p>"Now, therefore, who is sober, let him be sober."</p>  
 <p>When then Jesus had spoken this unto his disciples, Thomas came forward and said: "My Lord, I am sober, I am plentifully sober, and my spirit is ready in me, and I rejoice exceedingly that thou hast revealed these words unto us. But indeed I have borne with my brethren until now, so that I should not anger them; nay</p>  
 <p><a name="page_67"><font size="1" color="green">p. 67</font></a></p>  
 <p>rather I have borne with every one that he should come before thee and speak |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>80</b>.</font></span> the solution of the repentance of Pistis Sophia. Now, therefore, my Lord, concerning the solution of the seventh repentance of Pistis Sophia thy light-power hath prophesied through the prophet David in the twenty-fourth Psalm, thus</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Thomas interpreteth the seventh repentance from Psalm xxiv.</font></span>"'1. O Lord, unto thee have I lifted up my soul, O my God.</p>  
 <p>"'2. I have abandoned myself unto thee; let me not be put to shame and let not mine enemies mock at me.</p>  
 <p>"'3. For all who wait upon thee shall not be put to shame; let them be put to shame who do iniquity without a cause.</p>  
 <p>"'4. O Lord, show me thy ways and teach me thy paths.</p>  
 <p>"'5. Lead me in the way of thy truth and teach me, for thou art my God and my saviour; on thee will I wait all the day long.</p>  
 <p>"'6. Call to remembrance thy mercies, O Lord, and the favours of thy grace, for they are from eternity.</p>  
 <p>"'7. Remember not the sins of my youth and those of my ignorance. Remember me according to the fulness of thy mercy because of thy goodness, O Lord.</p>  
 <p>"'8. The Lord is gracious and sincere; therefore fore will he instruct sinners in the way.</p>  
 <p>"'9. He will guide the tender-hearted |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>81</b>.</font></span> in the judgment and will teach the tender-hearted his ways.</p>  
 <p>"'10. All the ways of the Lord are grace and truth for them who seek his righteousness and his testimonies.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_68"><font size="1" color="green">p. 68</font></a></p>  
 <p>"'11. For thy name's sake, O Lord, forgive me my sin, [for] it is exceedingly great.</p>  
 <p>"'12. Who is the man who feareth the Lord? For him will he establish laws in the way which he hath chosen.</p>  
 <p>"'13. His soul will abide in good things and his seed will inherit the land.</p>  
 <p>"'14. The Lord is the strength of them who fear him; and the name of the Lord belongeth to them who fear him, to make known unto them his covenant.</p>  
 <p>"'15. Mine eyes are raised ever unto the Lord, for he will draw my feet out of the snare.</p>  
 <p>"'16. Look down upon me and be gracious unto me, for I am an only-begotten; I am wretched.</p>  
 <p>"'17. The afflictions of my heart have in-creased; bring me out of my necessities.</p>  
 <p>"'18. Look upon my abasement and my woe, and forgive me all my sins.</p>  
 <p>"'19. Look upon mine enemies, how they have increased themselves and hated me with unjust hatred.</p>  
 <p>"'20. Preserve my soul and save me; let me not |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>82</b>.</font></span> be put to shame, for I have hoped on thee.</p>  
 <p>"'21. The simple and sincere have joined themselves to me, for I have waited on thee, O Lord.</p>  
 <p>"'22. O God, deliver Israel from all his afflictions.'"</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Jesus commendeth Thomas.</font></span>And when Jesus had heard the words of Thomas, he said unto him: "Well said, Thomas, and finely. This is the solution of the seventh repentance of Pistis Sophia. Amēn, amēn, I say unto</p>  
 <p><a name="page_69"><font size="1" color="green">p. 69</font></a></p>  
 <p>you: All generations of the world shall bless you on earth, because I have revealed this unto you and ye have received, of my spirit and have become understanding and spiritual, understanding what I say. And hereafter will I fill you full with the whole light and the whole power of the spirit, so that ye may understand from now on all which shall be said unto you and which ye shall see. Yet a little while and I will speak with you concerning the height without within and within without."</p>
