 <p>And Jesus answered and said unto Mary: "Finely indeed dost thou question concerning all with precision and certainty. But hearken, Mary, that I may speak with thee about the consummation of the æon and the ascension of the universe. It will not yet take place; but I have said unto you: 'If I lead you into the region of the inheritances of those who shall receive the mystery of the Light, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>189</b>.</font></span> then will the Treasury of the Light, the region of the emanations, count for you as a speck of dust only and as the light of the sun by day.'</p>  
 <p>"I have therefore said: 'This will take place</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the twelve saviours and their regions in the Inheritance.</font></span>at the time of the consummation [and] of the ascension of the universe.' The twelve saviours of the Treasury and the twelve orders of every one of them, which are the emanations of the seven Voices and of the five Trees, they will be with me in the region of the inheritances of the Light; being kings with me in my kingdom, and every one of them being king over his emanations, and moreover every one of them being king according to his glory, the great according to his greatness and the little according to his littleness.</p>  
 <p>"And the saviour of the emanations of the first Voice will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the first mystery of the First Mystery in my kingdom.</p>  
 <p>"And the saviour of the emanations of the second Voice will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the second mystery of the First Mystery.</p>  
 <p>"In like manner also will the saviour of the emanations of the third Voice be in the region of the souls of those who have received the third mystery of the First Mystery in the E inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"And the saviour of the emanations of the fourth Voice of the Treasury of the Light will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the fourth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"And the fifth saviour of the fifth Voice of the Treasury of the Light will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the fifth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></a></p>  
 <p>"And the sixth saviour of the emanations of the sixth Voice of the Treasury of the Light will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the sixth mystery of the First Mystery.</p>  
 <p>"And the seventh saviour of the emanations of the seventh Voice of the Treasury of the Light will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the seventh mystery of the First Mystery in the Treasury [<i>sic</i>] of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"And the eighth saviour, that is the saviour of the emanations of the first Tree of the Treasury of the Light, will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the I eighth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"And the ninth saviour, that is the saviour of the emanations of the second Tree of the Treasury of the Light, will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the ninth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"And the tenth saviour, that is the saviour of the emanations of the third Tree of the Treasury of the Light, will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the tenth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"In like manner also the eleventh saviour, that is the saviour of the fourth Tree of the Treasury of the Light, will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the eleventh mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"And the twelfth saviour, that is the saviour of the emanations of the fifth Tree of the Treasury of the Light, will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the twelfth mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.</p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the ascension of those of the Treasury into the Inheritance.</font></span>"And the seven |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>192</b>.</font></span> Amēns and the five Trees and the three Amēns will be on my right, being kings in the inheritances of the Light. And the Twin-saviours, that is the Child of the Child, and the nine guards will bide also at my left, being kings in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of their respective ranks in the kingdom.</font></span>"And every one of the saviours will rule over the orders of his emanations in the inheritances of the Light as they did also in the Treasury of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"And the nine guards of the Treasury of the Light will be superior to the saviours in the inheritances of the Light. And the Twin-saviours will be superior to the nine guards in the kingdom. And the three Amēns will be superior to the Twin-saviours in the kingdom. And the five Trees will be superior to the three Amēns in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the powers of the Right, and their emanation and ascension.</font></span>"And Yew and the guard of the veil of the Great Light, and the receiver of Light and the two great guides and the great Sabaōth, the Good, will be kings in the first saviour of the first Voice of the Treasury of the Light, [the saviour] who will be in |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>193</b>.</font></span> the region of those who have received the first mystery of the First Mystery. For in sooth Yew and the guard of the region of those of the Right and Melchisedec, the great receiver of the Light, and the two great guides have come forth out of the purified and utterly pure light of the first Tree up to the fifth.</p>  
 <p>"Yew in sooth is the overseer of the Light, who hath come forth first out of the pure light of the first Tree; on the other hand the guard of the veil of those of the Right hath come forth out of the second Tree; and the two guides again</p>  
 <p><a name="page_163"><font size="1" color="green">p. 163</font></a></p>  
 <p>have come forth out of the pure and utterly purified light of the third and fourth Trees of the Treasury of the Light; Melchisedec again hath come forth out of the fifth Tree; on the other hand Sabaōth, the Good, whom I have called my father, hath come forth out of Yew, the overseer of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"These six then by command of the First Mystery the last Helper hath caused to be in the region of those of the Right, for the economy of the ingathering of the upper light out of the æons of the rulers and out of the worlds and all races in them,--of every one of whom I will tell you the employment over which he hath been set in the expansion of the universe. Because, therefore, of the importance of the employment over which they have been set, |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>194</b>.</font></span> they will be fellow-kings in the first [saviour] of the first Voice of the Treasury of the Light, who will be in the region of the souls of those who have received the first mystery of the First Mystery.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the powers of the Midst and their ascension.</font></span>"And the Virgin of Light and the great guide of the Midst, whom the rulers of the æons are wont to call the Great Yew after the name of a great ruler who is in their region,--he and the Virgin of Light and his twelve ministers, from whom ye have received your shape and from whom ye have received the power, they all will be kings with the first saviour of the first Voice in the region of the souls of those who will receive the first mystery of the First Mystery in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"And the fifteen helpers of the seven virgins of the Light who are in the Midst, they will expand themselves in the regions of the twelve saviours,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></a></p>  
 <p>and the rest of the angels of the Midst, every one of them according to his glory, will rule with me in the inheritances of the Light. And I shall rule over them all in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">But this shall not take place till the consummation of the æon.</font></span>"All this then which I have said unto you, will not take place at this time, but it will take place at the consummation of the æon, that is at the ascension of the universe; that is at the dissolution of the universe and at the total ascension of the numbering |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>195</b>.</font></span> of the perfect souls of the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"Before the consummation, therefore, this which I have said unto you, will not take place, but every one will be in his own region, into which he hath been set from the beginning, until the numbering of the ingathering of the perfect souls is completed.</p>  
 <p>"The seven Voices and the five Trees and the three Amēns and the Twin-saviours and the nine guards and the twelve saviours and those of the region of the Right and those of the region of the Midst, every one will abide in the region in which they have been set, until the numbering of the perfect souls of the inheritances of the Light shall be raised up all together.</p>  
 <p>"And also all the rulers who have repented, they also will abide in the region into which they have been set, until the numbering of the souls of the Light shall be raised up all together.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the ascension of the souls of the perfect.</font></span>"[The souls] will all come, every one at the time when he will receive the mysteries; and all the rulers who have repented, will pass through and come into the region of the Midst. And those of the Midst will baptize them and give unto them the spiritual unction and seal them with the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></a></p>  
 <p>seals of their mysteries. And they will pass through those of all the regions of the Midst, and they will pass through the region of the Right and the interior of the region of the nine guards and the interior of the region of the Twin-saviours and the interior of the region of the three |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>196</b>.</font></span> Amens and of the twelve saviours and the interior of the five Trees and of the seven Voices. Every one giveth unto them his seal of his mystery, and they pass into the interior of them all and go to the region of the inheritances of the Light; and every one bideth in the region up to which he hath received mysteries in the inheritances of the Light.</p>  
 <p><span class="margnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN">Of the rank of the souls of the perfect.</font></span>"In a word, all the souls of men who shall receive the mysteries of the Light, will precede all the rulers who have repented, and they will precede all those of the region of the Midst and those of the whole region of the Right, and they will precede those of the whole region of the Treasury of the Light. In a word, they will precede all those of the region [of the Treasury], and they will precede all those of the regions of the first Commandment, and they will pass into the interior of them all and go into the Inheritance of the Light up to the region of their mystery; and every one abideth in the region up to which he hath received mysteries. And those of the region of the Midst and of the Right and those of the whole region of the Treasury, every one abideth in the region of the order into which he hath been set from the beginning on, until the universe shall be raised up. And every one of them accomplisheth his economy to which he hath been set, in respect of the ingathering of the souls who</p>  
 <p><a name="page_166"><font size="1" color="green">p. 166</font></a></p>  
 <p>have received the mysteries, in respect of this economy, so that they may seal |<span class="rmargnote"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><b>197</b>.</font></span> all the souls who will receive the mysteries and who will pass through their interior towards the Inheritance of the Light.</p>  
 <p>"Now, therefore, Mary, this is the word concerning which thou dost question me with precision and certainty. For the rest now then, who hath ears to hear, let him hear."</p>
