                               Synod of Dordrecht
                        November 13, 1618 - May 9, 1619
 
          FIRST HEAD OF DOCTRINE. DIVINE ELECTION AND REPROBATION
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 1. As  all  men  have sinned in Adam, lie
          under the curse,  and  are  deserving  of  eternal death, God
          would have done no  injustice  by  leaving them all to perish
          and delivering them over to  condemnation  on account of sin,
          according to the words of  the apostle: "that every mouth may
          be silenced and the  whole  world  held  accountable to God."
          (Rom 3:19). And: "for all have  sinned  and fall short of the
          glory of God," (Rom  3:23).  And:  "For  the  wages of sin is
          death." (Rom 6:23).
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE  2.  but  in  this  the  love  of God was
          manifested, that He  "sent  his  one  and  only  Son into the
          world, that whoever believes in him shall not perish but have
          eternal life." (1 John 4:9, John 3:16).
 
          FIRST HEAD:  ARTICLE  3.  And  that  men  may  be  brought to
          believe, God mercifully  sends  the  messengers of these most
          joyful tiding to whom He will and at what time He pleases; by
          whose ministry men  are  called  to  repentance  and faith in
          Christ crucified. "How, then, can  they  call on the one they
          have not believed in? And how  can they believe in the one of
          whom they have  not  heard?  And  how  can  they hear without
          someone preaching to them?  And  how  can  they preach unless
          they are sent?" (Rom 10:14-15).
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 4. The wrath of God abides upon those who
          believe not this gospel. But  such  as receive it and embrace
          Jesus the Savior  by  a  true  and  living  faith  are by Him
          delivered from the wrath  of  God  and  from destruction, and
          have the gift of eternal life conferred upon them.
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 5. The cause or guilt of this unbelief as
          well as of all other  sins  is  no  wise  in  God, but in man
          himself; whereas faith in  Jesus Christ and salvation through
          Him is the free gift of God,  as it is written: "For it is by
          grace you have been saved,  through  faith--and this not from
          yourselves, it is the gift  of God" (Eph 2:8). Likewise: "For
          it has been granted to  you  on  behalf of Christ not only to
          believe on him, but also to suffer for him" (Phil 1:29)
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 6.  That  some  receive the gift of faith
          from God, and others do  not  receive it, proceeds from God's
          eternal decree. "For now unto God  are all his works from the
          beginning of the world"  (Acts  15:18  A.V.).  "who works out
          everything in conformity with the  purpose  of his will" (Eph
          1:11). According to  which  decree  He graciously softens the
          hearts of the elect, however  obstinate, and inclines them to
          believe; while He leaves the  non-elect  in His just judgment
          to  their  own  wickedness   and   obduracy.  And  herein  is
          especially displayed the profound,  the  merciful, and at the
          same time the  righteous  discrimination  between men equally
          involved in ruin; or that decree of election and reprobation,
          revealed in the Word of  God,  which, though men of perverse,
          impure, and unstable minds wrest it to their own destruction,
          yet to holy and pious souls affords unspeakable consolation.
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 7.  Election  is the unchangeable purpose
          of God, whereby, before the  foundation  of the world, He has
          out of mere grace, according  to  the sovereign good pleasure
          of His own will, chosen from  the whole human race, which had
          fallen through their own  fault  from  the primitive state of
          rectitude into  sin  and  destruction,  a  certain  number of
          persons  to  redemption  in  Christ,  whom  He  from eternity
          appointed  the  Mediator  and  Head  of  the  elect  and  the
          foundation of salvation. This  elect number, though by nature
          neither better nor more deserving  than others, but with them
          involved in one common  misery,  God  has  decreed to give to
          Christ to be saved by  Him,  and  effectually to call an draw
          them to His communion by His  Word and Spirit; to bestow upon
          them  true  faith,  justification,  and  sanctification;  and
          having powerfully preserved  them  in  the  fellowship of His
          son, finally to glorify  them  for  the  demonstration of His
          mercy, and for  the  praise  of  the  riches  of His glorious
          grace; as it is written  "For  he  chose us in him before the
          creation of the world to be  holy and blameless in his sight.
          In love he predestined us to  be  adopted as his sons through
          Jesus Christ, in accordance with  his  pleasure and will-- to
          the praise of his glorious  grace,  which he has freely given
          us in the One  he  loves."  (Eph  1:4-6). And elsewhere: "And
          those he predestined, he  also  called;  those  he called, he
          also justified; those he  justified, he also glorified." (Rom
          8:30).
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE  8.  There  are  not  various  decrees of
          election, but one and  the  same  decree respecting all those
          who shall be saved,  both  under  the  Old and New Testament;
          since the Scripture declares  the good pleasure, purpose, and
          counsel of the divine will to  be  one, according to which He
          has chosen us from eternity, both  to  grace and to glory, to
          salvation and to the way  of salvation, which He has ordained
          that we should walk therein (Eph 1:4, 5; 2:10).
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 9.  This  election  was  not founded upon
          foreseen faith and the obedience  of  faith, holiness, or any
          other  good   quality   or   disposition   in   man,  as  the
          prerequisite, cause, or condition  of  which it depended; but
          men are  chosen  to  faith  and  to  the  obedience of faith,
          holiness, etc. Therefore  election  is  the fountain of every
          saving good,  from  which  proceed  faith,  holiness, and the
          other gifts of salvation, and finally eternal life itself, as
          its fruits and effects,  according  to  the  testimony of the
          apostle: "For he chose us (not  because  we were, but) in him
          before the creation of the world  to be holy and blameless in
          his sight." (Eph 1:4).
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 10. The good  pleasure of God is the sole
          cause of  this  gracious  election;  which  does  not consist
          herein that out of all  possible qualities and actions of men
          God has chosen some as a  condition of salvation, but that He
          was pleased out of the common  mass  of sinners to adopt some
          certain persons as a  peculiar  people  to  Himself, as it is
          written: "Yet,  before  the  twins  were  born  or  had  done
          anything good or bad--in order that God's purpose in election
          might stand: not by works but by him who calls--she (Rebekah)
          was told, 'The older will serve  the  younger.' Just as it is
          written: 'Jacob I loved, but  Esau  I hated.'" (Rom 9:11-13).
          "When the Gentiles heard this, they were glad and honored the
          word of the Lord; and all who were appointed for eternal life
          believed." (Acts 13:48).
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE  11.  And  as  God  Himself is most wise,
          unchangeable, omniscient,  and  omnipotent,  so  the election
          made by Him can neither be interrupted nor changed, recalled,
          or annulled; neither can  the  elect  be cast away, nor their
          number diminished.
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE  12.  The  elect  in  due time, though in
          various  degrees  and  in   different  measures,  attain  the
          assurance of this  their  eternal  and unchangeable election,
          not by inquisitively prying into  the  secret and deep things
          of God, but by observing  in  themselves with a spiritual joy
          and holy pleasure the  infallible  fruits of election pointed
          out in the Word of God  -  such  as,  a true faith in Christ,
          filial  fear,  a  godly  sorrow  for  sin,  a  hungering  and
          thirsting after righteousness, etc.
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE  13.  The  sense  and  certainty  of this
          election afford to the children  of God additional matter for
          daily humiliation before Him,  for  adoring  the depth of His
          mercies, for  cleansing  themselves,  and  rendering grateful
          returns of ardent love to  Him  who first manifested so great
          love towards  them.  The  consideration  of  this doctrine of
          election  is  so  far  from  encouraging  remissness  in  the
          observance of the  divine  commands  or  from  sinking men in
          carnal security, that these, in the just judgment of God, are
          the usual effects of rash  presumption  or of idle and wanton
          trifling with the grace of  election,  in those who refuse to
          walk in the ways of the elect.
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 14.  As  the  doctrine of election by the
          most wise counsel of  God  was  declared  by the prophets, by
          Christ Himself, and by the  apostles, and is clearly revealed
          in the Scriptures both of the  Old  and the New Testament, so
          it is still to  be  published  in  due  time and place in the
          Church of God, for which it was peculiarly designed, provided
          it be done with  reverence,  in  the spirit of discretion and
          piety, for  the  glory  of  God's  most  holy  Name,  and for
          enlivening  and   comforting   His   people,  without  vainly
          attempting to investigate the  secret  ways  of the Most High
          (Acts 20:27; Rom 11:33f; 12:3; Heb 6:17f).
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 15.  What  peculiarly tends to illustrate
          and recommend  to  us  the  eternal  and  unmerited  grace of
          election is the  express  testimony  of sacred Scripture that
          not all, but some only,  are elected, while others are passed
          by in the eternal  decree;  whom  God,  out of His sovereign,
          most just, irreprehensible,  and  unchangeable good pleasure,
          has decreed to leave  in  the  common  misery into which they
          have willfully plunged  themselves,  and  not  to bestow upon
          them  saving  faith  and   the   grace  of  conversion;  but,
          permitting them in  His  just  judgment  to  follow their own
          ways, at last, for the declaration of His justice, to condemn
          and punish  them  forever,  not  only  on  account  of  their
          unbelief, but also for all their  other sins. And this is the
          decree of reprobation, which by no means makes God the Author
          of sin (the very though  of which is blasphemy), but declares
          Him to be an awful,  irreprehensible, and righteous Judge and
          Avenger thereof.
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE  16.  Those  in  whom  a  living faith in
          Christ, and assured confidence  of soul, peace of conscience,
          an earnest endeavor after filial obedience, a glorying in God
          through  Christ,  is  not  as  yet  strongly  felt,  and  who
          nevertheless make use of  the  means  which God has appointed
          for working these graces in  us,  ought  not to be alarmed at
          the mention of reprobation, nor  to rank themselves among the
          reprobate, but diligently to persevere  in  the use of means,
          and with ardent desires  devoutly  and  humble  to wait for a
          season of richer grace.  Much  less  cause to be terrified by
          the  doctrine  of  reprobation  have  they  who,  though they
          seriously desire to be turned to God, to please Him only, and
          to be delivered from the body of death, cannot yet reach that
          measure of holiness and faith  to  which they aspire; since a
          merciful God has promised that He will not quench the smoking
          flax, nor break the bruised reed. But this doctrine is justly
          terrible to those who,  regardless  of  God and of the Savior
          Jesus Christ, have wholly given themselves up to the cares of
          the world and the pleasures of the flesh, so long as they are
          not seriously converted to God.
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 17. Since we  are to judge of the will of
          God from His  Word,  which  testifies  that  the  children of
          believers are holy,  not  by  nature,  but  in  virtue of the
          covenant of grace, in  which  they  together with the parents
          are  comprehended,  godly  parents  ought  not  to  doubt the
          election and salvation of their  children whom it pleases God
          to call out of this  life  in  their  infancy (Gen 17:7; Acts
          2:39; 1 Cor 7:14).
 
          FIRST HEAD: ARTICLE 18. To those who murmur at the free grace
          of election and the  just  severity  of reprobation we answer
          with the apostle "But who  are  you,  O  man, to talk back to
          God?" (Rom 9:20),  and  quote  the  language  of  our Savior:
          "Don't I have the right to do what I want with my own?" (Matt
          20:15).  And  therefore,   with   holy   adoration  of  these
          mysteries, we exclaim in the  words  of the apostle: "Oh, the
          depth of the riches of the  wisdom  and knowledge of God! How
          unsearchable his judgments, and his paths beyond tracing out!
          'Who has known the  mind  of  the  Lord?  Or who has been his
          counselor?' 'Who has ever given to God, that God should repay
          him?' For from him and through him and to him are all things.
          To him be the glory forever! Amen." (Rom 11:33-36).
 
          REJECTION OF ERRORS
 
          The true doctrine concerning  election and reprobation having
          been explained, the Synod rejects the errors of those:
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 1. Who teach:  That  the will of God to
          save those who would believe and would persevere in faith and
          in the obedience of faith is  the  whole and entire decree of
          election, and that  nothing  else  concerning this decree has
          been revealed in God's Word.
 
          For these  deceive  the  simple  and  plainly  contradict the
          Scriptures, which declare that God  will  not only save those
          who will believe, but that  He  has also from eternity chosen
          certain particular persons  to  whom,  above  others, He will
          grant in time, both faith  in  Christ and perseverance; as it
          is written "I have revealed you to those whom you gave me out
          of the world. (John  17:6).  "and  all who were appointed for
          eternal life believed. (Acts 13:48)". And "For he chose us in
          him before the creation of the world to be holy and blameless
          in his sight. (Eph 1:4)."
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 2.  Who  teach:  That there are various
          kinds of election of God  unto  eternal life: the one general
          and indefinite, the other  particular  and definite; and that
          the  latter  in   turn   is   either  incomplete,  revocable,
          non-decisive,  and  conditional,  or  complete,  irrevocable,
          decisive, and absolute. Likewise:  That there is one election
          unto faith and another unto  salvation,  so that election can
          be unto justifying faith,  without  being a decisive election
          unto salvation.
 
          For this is a  fancy  of  men's minds, invented regardless of
          the  Scriptures,  whereby   the   doctrine   of  election  is
          corrupted, and this golden chain  of our salvation is broken:
          "And those he predestined, he  also  called; those he called,
          he also justified;  those  he  justified,  he also glorified.
          (Rom 8:30)."
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 3.  Who  teach:  That the good pleasure
          and purpose of God, of  which  Scripture makes mention in the
          doctrine of election,  does  not  consist  in  this, that God
          chose certain persons rather than  others,  but in this, that
          He chose out of all possible conditions (among which are also
          the works of the law), or  out  of the whole order of things,
          that act of faith which  from its very nature is undeserving,
          as well  as  it  incomplete  obedience,  as  a  condition  of
          salvation, and  that  He  would  graciously  consider this in
          itself as a complete  obedience  and  count  it worthy of the
          reward of eternal life.
 
          For by this  injurious  error  the  pleasure  of  God and the
          merits of Christ are made of  none  effect, and men are drawn
          away  by  useless  questions   from  the  truth  of  gracious
          justification and from the  simplicity of Scripture, and this
          declaration of the apostle  is  charged  as  untrue: "who has
          saved us and  called  us  to  a  holy  life,  not  because of
          anything we have  done  but  because  of  his own purpose and
          grace. This grace was  given  us  in  Christ Jesus before the
          beginning of time (2 Tim 1:9)."
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 4. Who teach: That in the election unto
          faith this condition is  beforehand  demanded that man should
          use the light of nature  aright,  be pious, humble, meek, and
          fit for eternal life, as if  on these things election were in
          any way dependent.
 
          For this savors of the  teaching  of Pelagius, and is opposed
          to the doctrine of the  apostle  when  he  writes: "All of us
          also lived among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of
          our sinful nature  and  following  its  desires and thoughts.
          Like the  rest,  we  were  by  nature  objects  of wrath. But
          because of his great love for  us, God, who is rich in mercy,
          made  us  alive  with  Christ  even  when  we  were  dead  in
          transgressions--it is by grace you  have  been saved. And God
          raised us up  with  Christ  and  seated  us  with  him in the
          heavenly realms in Christ Jesus,  in order that in the coming
          ages he might  show  the  incomparable  riches  of his grace,
          expressed in his kindness to us in Christ Jesus. For it is by
          grace you have been saved,  through  faith--and this not from
          yourselves, it is the gift of  God-- not by works, so that no
          one can boast (Eph 2:3-9)."
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 5. Who  teach:  That the incomplete and
          non-decisive  election  of  particular  persons  to salvation
          occurred because of a  foreseen  faith, conversion, holiness,
          godliness, which either began or continued for some time; but
          that the complete and  decisive  election occurred because of
          foreseen perseverance  unto  the  end  in  faith, conversion,
          holiness, and godliness; and  that  this  is the gracious and
          evangelical worthiness, for  the  sake  of  which  he  who is
          chosen is more worthy than  he  who  is  not chosen; and that
          therefore faith, the obedience of faith, holiness, godliness,
          and perseverance are not  fruits of the unchangeable election
          unto  glory,  but  are   conditions   which,  being  required
          beforehand, were foreseen as being  met  by those who will be
          fully elected, and are  causes without which the unchangeable
          election to glory does not occur.
 
          This is repugnant to  the  entire Scripture, which constantly
          inculcates this and similar declarations: Election is "not by
          works but by him who  calls  (Rom  9:12)."  "And all who were
          appointed for eternal  life  believed  (Acts 13:48)." "For he
          chose us in him before the  creation  of the world to be holy
          and blameless in his  sight  (Eph  1:4)." "You did not choose
          me, but I chose you  and  appointed  you to go and bear fruit
          that will last. Then  the  Father  will give you whatever you
          ask in my name (John 15:16)." "And if by grace, then it is no
          longer by works (Rom 11:6)." "This is love: not that we loved
          God, but that he loved us and sent his Son (1 John 4:10)."
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 6. Who  teach:  That not every election
          unto salvation is unchangeable, but  that  some of the elect,
          any decree of  God  notwithstanding,  can  yet  perish and do
          indeed perish.
 
          By this gross error they  make God be changeable, and destroy
          the comfort which the  godly  obtain  out  of the firmness of
          their election,  and  contradict  the  Holy  Scripture, which
          teaches that the elect  can  not  be led astray (Matt 24:24),
          that Christ does  not  lose  those  whom  the Father gave him
          (John 6:39),  and  that  God  also  glorified  those  whom he
          foreordained, called, and justified (Rom 8:30).
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 7.  Who  teach:  That  there is in this
          life no fruit and no  consciousness of the unchangeable elect
          to glory, nor any certainty,  except  that which depends on a
          changeable and uncertain condition.
 
          For not only is it absurd to speak of an uncertain certainty,
          but also contrary to  the  experience  of  the saints, who by
          virtue of the  consciousness  of  their election rejoice with
          the apostle  and  praise  this  favor  of  God  (Eph  1); who
          according to Christ's admonition  rejoice  with his disciples
          that their names are written in heaven (Luke 10:20); who also
          place the consciousness  of  their  election over against the
          fiery darts of the devil,  asking: "Who will bring any charge
          against those whom God has chosen? (Rom 8:33)."
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH  8.  Who  teach:  That  God,  simply by
          virtue of His righteous will,  did not decide either to leave
          anyone in the fall of  Adam  and  in the common state sin and
          condemnation, or to pass  anyone  by  in the communication of
          grace which is necessary for faith and conversion.
 
          For this is firmly decreed: "God  has  mercy on whom he wants
          to have mercy, and he  hardens  whom  he wants to harden (Rom
          9:18)." And also this: "The  knowledge  of the secrets of the
          kingdom of heaven has been given to you, but not to them (Mat
          13:11)." Likewise: "I praise you,  Father, Lord of heaven and
          earth, because you have hidden these things from the wise and
          learned, and revealed them to  little children. Yes , Father,
          for this was your good pleasure (Mat 11:25-26)."
 
          FIRST HEAD: PARAGRAPH 9. Who  teach:  That the reason why God
          sends the gospel to one people  rather than to another is not
          merely and solely the  good  pleasure  of God, but rather the
          fact that one people is  better  and worthier than another to
          which the gospel is not communicated.
 
          For this Moses denies  ,  addressing  the people of Israel as
          follows: "To the LORD your  God  belong the heavens, even the
          highest heavens, the earth and everything in it. Yet the LORD
          set his affection on your  forefathers and loved them, and he
          chose you, their descendants, above all the nations, as it is
          today (Deu 10:14-15)." And Christ said: "Woe to you, Korazin!
          Woe to you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that were performed in
          you had been performed  in  Tyre  and  Sidon, they would have
          repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes (Mat 11:21)."
 
          SECOND HEAD  OF  DOCTRINE.  THE  DEATH  OF  CHRIST,  AND  THE
          REDEMPTION OF MEN THEREBY
 
          SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 1. God  is  not only supremely merciful,
          but also supremely just. And  His justice requires (as He has
          revealed Himself in His Word) that our sins committed against
          His  infinite  majesty  should  be  punished,  not  only with
          temporal but with eternal punishments, both in body and soul;
          which we cannot escape,  unless  satisfaction  be made to the
          justice of God.
 
          SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 2.  Since,  therefore,  we are unable to
          make that satisfaction  in  our  own  persons,  or to deliver
          ourselves from the wrath of God,  He  has been pleased of His
          infinite mercy to give His  only begotten Son for our Surety,
          who was made sin, and became a curse for us and in our stead,
          that He might  make  satisfaction  to  divine  justice on our
          behalf.
 
          SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 3. The  death  of  the Son of God is the
          only and most perfect sacrifice and satisfaction for sin, and
          is of  infinite  worth  and  value,  abundantly sufficient to
          expiate the sins of the whole world.
 
          SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 4. This  death is of such infinite value
          and dignity because the  person  who  submitted to it was not
          only begotten Son of  God,  of  the same eternal and infinite
          essence  with  the   Father   and   the  Holy  Spirit,  which
          qualifications were necessary to  constitute Him a Savior for
          us; and, moreover, because  it  was  attended with a sense of
          the wrath and curse of God due to us for sin.
 
          SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 5. Moreover,  the  promise of the gospel
          is that  whosoever  believes  in  Christ  crucified shall not
          perish, but have  eternal  life.  This promise, together with
          the command to repent and  believe,  ought to be declared and
          published to all  nations,  and  to all persons promiscuously
          and without distinction, to whom God out of His good pleasure
          sends the gospel.
 
          SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 6. And,  whereas  many who are called by
          the gospel do not repent nor believe in Christ, but perish in
          unbelief, this is not owing to any defect or insufficiency in
          the sacrifice offered by Christ upon the cross, but is wholly
          to be imputed to themselves.
 
          SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 7. But as many as truly believe, and are
          delivered and  saved  from  sin  and  destruction through the
          death of Christ, are indebted  for this benefit solely to the
          grace of God given them  in  Christ from everlasting, and not
          to any merit of their own.
 
          SECOND HEAD: ARTICLE 8.  For  this  was the sovereign counsel
          and most gracious will and purpose of God the Father that the
          quickening and saving efficacy of  the most precious death of
          His Son should extend  to  all  the elect, for bestowing upon
          them alone the gift  of  justifying  faith,  thereby to bring
          them infallibly to salvation; that is, it was the will of God
          that Christ by the blood  of  the cross, whereby He confirmed
          the new  covenant,  should  effectually  redeem  out of every
          people, tribe, nation,  and  language,  all  those, and those
          only, who were from eternity chosen to salvation and given to
          Him by the Father;  that  He  should  confer upon them faith,
          which, together with all the  other  saving gifts of the Holy
          Spirit, He purchased for them by His death; should purge them
          from all sin,  both  original  and  actual, whether committed
          before or after  believing;  and  having faithfully preserved
          them even to the end,  should  at  last bring them, free from
          every spot and blemish, to the  enjoyment of glory in His own
          presence forever.
 
          SECOND  HEAD:  ARTICLE  9.   This  purpose,  proceeding  from
          everlasting love towards the elect, has from the beginning of
          the world to this day  been powerfully accomplished, and will
          henceforeward   still    continue    to    be   accomplished,
          notwithstanding all the ineffectual  opposition  of the gates
          of hell; so  that  the  elect  in  due  time  may be gathered
          together into one,  and  that  there  never  may be wanting a
          Church composed of believers, the foundation of which is laid
          in the  blood  of  christ;  which  may  stedfastly  love  and
          faithfully serve Him as its  Savior (who, as a bridegroom for
          his bride, laid down His life  for  them upon the cross); and
          which  may  celebrate  His   praises  here  and  through  all
          eternity.
 
          REJECTION OF ERRORS
 
          The true doctrine  having  been  explained, the Synod rejects
          the errors of those:
 
          SECOND HEAD: PARAGRAPH 1. Who  teach: That God the Father has
          ordained His Son to the death  of the cross without a certain
          and definite decree  to  save  any,  so  that  the necessity,
          profitableness, and worth of what christ merited by His death
          might have  existed,  and  might  remain  in  all  its  parts
          complete, perfect, and intact, even if the merited redemption
          had never in fact been applied to any person.
 
          For this doctrine tends to the despising of the wisdom of the
          Father and of the merits of  Jesus Christ, and is contrary to
          Scripture. For thus says our Savior:  "I lay down my life for
          the sheep ... and I  know  them.  (John  10:15, 27)." And the
          prophet Isaiah says concerning  the  Savior:  "Yet it was the
          Lord's will to crush him and  cause him to suffer, and though
          the LORD makes his life  a  guilt  offering,  he will see his
          offspring and prolong his days, and the will of the LORD will
          prosper in his hand  (Isa  53:10)." Finally, this contradicts
          the article  of  faith  according  to  which  we  believe the
          catholic Christian Church.
 
          SECOND HEAD: PARAGRAPH  2.  Who  teach:  That  it was not the
          purpose of the death of Christ that He should confirm the new
          covenant of grace through His  blood, but only that He should
          acquire for the Father the  mere  right to establish with man
          such a covenant as He  might  please,  whether of grace or of
          works.
 
          For this is repugnant to  Scripture which teaches that "Jesus
          has become the guarantee of a  better  covenant that is a new
          covenant ..." and that "it  never  takes effect while the one
          who made it is living. (Heb 7:22; 9:15, 17)."
 
          SECOND HEAD: PARAGRAPH  3.  Who  teach:  That  Christ  by His
          satisfaction merited neither  salvation  itself  for any one,
          nor faith, whereby this satisfaction of Christ unto salvation
          is effectually  appropriated;  but  that  He  merited for the
          Father only the authority or  the  perfect will to deal again
          with man, and to prescribe new conditions as He might desire,
          obedience to which, however,  depended  on  the  free will of
          man, so that it therefore might have come to pass that either
          none or all should fulfill these conditions.
 
          For these adjudge too contemptuously  of the death of Christ,
          in no wise acknowledge that  most  important fruit or benefit
          thereby gained and bring again  out  of the hell the Pelagian
          error.
 
          SECOND HEAD: PARAGRAPH 4. Who teach: That the new covenant of
          grace, which God the  Father,  through  the  mediation of the
          death of Christ, made with  man, does not herein consist that
          we by faith, in as much  as  it accepts the merits of Christ,
          are justified before God and saved, but in the fact that God,
          having revoked  the  demand  of  perfect  obedience of faith,
          regards faith itself  and  the  obedience  of faith, although
          imperfect, as the  perfect  obedience  of  the  law, and does
          esteem it  worthy  of  the  reward  of  eternal  life through
          grace.
 
          For these contradict the Scriptures, being: "justified freely
          by his grace  through  the  redemption  that  came  by Christ
          Jesus. God presented him as a sacrifice of atonement, through
          faith in his blood (Rom 3:24-25)." And these proclaim, as did
          the wicked Socinus, a  new  and  strange justification of man
          before God, against the consensus of the whole Church.
 
          SECOND HEAD: PARAGRAPH 5. Who  teach:  That all men have been
          accepted unto the state of  reconciliation and unto the grace
          of the covenant, so that no  one is worthy of condemnation on
          account of original sin, and  that  no one shall be condemned
          because of it,  but  that  all  are  free  from  the guilt of
          original sin.
 
          For this opinion is repugnant to Scripture which teaches that
          we are by nature children of wrath (Eph 2:3).
 
          SECOND HEAD:  PARAGRAPH  6.  Who  use  the difference between
          meriting and appropriating, to the  end  that they may instil
          into  the  minds  of  the  imprudent  and  inexperienced this
          teaching that God, as far as He is concerned, has been minded
          to apply to all equally the  benefits  gained by the death of
          Christ; but that, while  some  obtain  the  pardon of sin and
          eternal life, and others do  not,  this difference depends on
          their own free will, which joins  itself to the grace that is
          offered without exception, and  that  it  is not dependent on
          the special gift of  mercy,  which  powerfully works in them,
          that  they  rather  than   others   should  appropriate  unto
          themselves this grace.
 
          For  these,  while   they   feign   that  they  present  this
          distinction in a sound sense,  seek to instil into the people
          the destructive poison of the Pelagian errors.
 
          SECOND HEAD:  PARAGRAPH  7.  Who  teach:  That Christ neither
          could die, nor needed to die, and also did not die, for those
          whom God loved in the  highest  degree and elected to eternal
          life, since these do not need the death of Christ.
 
          For the contradict the  apostle, who declares, Christ: "loved
          me and gave himself for  me  (Gal 2:20)." Likewise: "Who will
          bring any charge against those whom God has chosen? It is God
          who justifies. Who is  he  that  condemns?  Christ Jesus, who
          died (Rom 8:33-34)", namely,  for  them;  and  the Savior who
          says: "I lay down my life  for  the sheep (John 10:15)." And:
          "My command is this: Love  each  other  as  I have loved you.
          Greater love has no one than  this, that he lay down his life
          for his friends (John 15:12-13)."
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEADS  OF  DOCTRINE.  THE CORRUPTION OF MAN,<br> HIS CONVERSION TO GOD, AND THE MANNER THEREOF
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE  1.  Man was originally formed
          after the image of God.  His understanding was adorned with a
          true and saving knowledge  of  his  Creator, and of spiritual
          things; his heart and will  were  upright, all his affections
          pure, and the whole man was  holy. But, revolting from God by
          the instigation of the devil  and  by  his  own free will, he
          forfeited these excellent gifts; and  an in the place thereof
          became involved  in  blindness  of  mind,  horrible darkness,
          vanity,  and   perverseness   of   judgment;  became  wicked,
          rebellious, and obdurate in heart and will, and impure in his
          affections.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD:  ARTICLE  2.  Man after the fall begat
          children in his  own  likeness.  A  corrupt  stock produced a
          corrupt offspring. Hence  all  the  posterity of Adam, Christ
          only excepted, have  derived  corruption  from their original
          parent, not by limitation, as  the Pelagians of old asserted,
          but by the propagation of a vicious nature, in consequence of
          the just judgment of God.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH  HEAD:  ARTICLE  3.  Therefore  all  men are
          conceived in  sin,  and  are  by  nature  children  of wrath,
          incapable of saving good, prone to  evil, dead in sin, and in
          bondage thereto; and  without  the  regenerating grace of the
          Holy Spirit, they are neither  able  nor willing to return to
          God, to reform the depravity  of  their nature, or to dispose
          themselves to reformation
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE  4.  There remain, however, in
          man since the fall, the glimmerings of natural light, whereby
          he retains some knowledge of  God,  or natural things, and of
          the difference between good and  evil,  and shows some regard
          for virtue and for good outward  behavior. But so far is this
          light of nature  from  begin  sufficient  to  bring  him to a
          saving knowledge of God  and  to  true  conversion that he is
          incapable of using  it  aright  even  in  things  natural and
          civil. Nay further,  this  light,  such  as  it  is  , man in
          various  ways  renders  wholly   polluted,   and  hinders  in
          unrighteousness, by doing which he becomes inexcusable before
          God.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE 5. In the same light are we to
          consider the law of  the  decalogue,  delivered by God to His
          peculiar people, the Jews, by  the hands of Moses. For though
          it reveals the greatness of  sin, and more and more convinces
          man thereof, yet,  as  it  neither  points  out  a remedy nor
          imparts strength to extricate him from his misery, but, being
          weak through the  flesh,  leaves  the  transgressor under the
          curse, man cannot by this law obtain saving grace.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH  HEAD:  ARTICLE  6. What, therefore, neither
          the light of nature nor the  law  could do, that God performs
          by the operation  of  the  Holy  Spirit  through  the word or
          ministry  of  reconciliation;  which   is  the  glad  tidings
          concerning the Messiah, by means  whereof  it has pleased God
          to save such as believe, as  well  under the Old as under the
          New Testament.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD:  ARTICLE  7.  This mystery of His will
          God reveals to but  a  small  number under the Old Testament;
          under the  New  Testament  (the  distinction  between various
          peoples having been removed) He reveals it to many. The cause
          of this dispensation is  not  to  be ascribed to the superior
          worth of one nation above another, nor to their better use of
          the light of nature,  but  results  wholly from the sovereign
          good pleasure and unmerited love  of  God. Hence they to whom
          so great and so  gracious  a  blessing is communicated, above
          their desert, or rather  notwithstanding  their demerits, are
          bound to acknowledge it with  humble and grateful hearts, and
          with the apostle to adore,  but  in  no wise curiously to pry
          into, the severity and  justice  of God's judgments displayed
          in others to whom this grace is not given.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE  8.  As  many as are called by
          the gospel are unfeignedly called. For God has most earnestly
          and truly declared in  His  Word  what  is acceptable to Him,
          namely, that those who  are  called  should come unto Him. He
          also seriously promises rest of  soul and eternal life to all
          who come to Him and believe.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE 9.  It is not the fault of the
          gospel, nor of Christ offered  therein, nor of God, who calls
          men by the gospel and  confers  upon them various gifts, that
          those who are called by  the  ministry  of the Word refuse to
          come and be converted. The  fault lies in themselves; some of
          whom when called, regardless of their danger, reject the Word
          of life; other, though they receive it, suffer it not to make
          a lasting impression  on  their  heart; therefore, their joy,
          arising only from a temporary  faith, soon vanishes, and they
          fall away;  while  others  choke  the  seed  of  the  Word by
          perplexing cares and the pleasures of this world, and produce
          no fruit. This our Savior teaches in the parable of the sower
          (Matt 13).
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD:  ARTICLE  10.  But that others who are
          called by the gospel obey the  call  and are converted is not
          to be ascribed to the  proper  exercise of free will, whereby
          one distinguishes himself above others equally furnished with
          grace sufficient  for  faith  and  conversion  (as  the proud
          heresy of Pelagius maintains); but it must be wholly ascribed
          to God, who,  as  He  has  chosen  His  own  from eternity in
          Christ, so He calls  them  effectually  in time, confers upon
          them faith and repentance,  rescues  them  from  the power of
          darkness, and translates them  into  the  kingdom  of His own
          Son; that they may  show  forth  the  praises  of Him who has
          called them out of darkness into His marvelous light, and may
          glory not in themselves  but  in  the  Lord, according to the
          testimony of the apostles in various places.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE  11. But when God accomplishes
          His good  pleasure  in  the  elect,  or  works  in  them true
          conversion, He not only  cause  the  gospel  to be externally
          preached to them, and  powerfully  illuminates their minds by
          His Holy Spirit, that they  may rightly under and discern the
          things of the Spirit of God;  but by the efficacy of the same
          regenerating Spirit He pervades  the  inmost recesses of man;
          He opens the  closed  and  softens  the  hardened  heart, and
          circumcises  that  which   was   uncircumcised;  infuses  new
          qualities into the  will,  which,  though heretofore dead, He
          quickens; from being  evil,  disobedient,  and refractory, He
          renders  it  good,  obedient,   and   pliable;  actuates  and
          strengthens it, that like a good tree, it may bring forth the
          fruits of good actions.
 
          THIRD  AND  FOURTH  HEAD:  ARTICLE   12.  And  this  is  that
          regeneration so highly extolled  in  Scripture, that renewal,
          new creation, resurrection from the dead, making alive, which
          God works in us  without  out  aid.  But  this  is in no wise
          effected merely by the external  preaching  of the gospel, by
          moral suasion, or such  a  mode  of operation that, after God
          has performed His part, it still  remains in the power of man
          to be regenerated  or  not,  to  be  converted or to continue
          unconverted; but it  is  evidently  a supernatural work, most
          powerful, and at the  same time most delightful, astonishing,
          mysterious,  and  ineffable;  not  inferior  in  efficacy  to
          creation or the resurrection from  the dead, as the Scripture
          inspired by the Author of this  work declares; so that all in
          whose heart God works in this marvelous manner are certainly,
          infallibly,  and  effectually  regenerated,  and  do actually
          believe. Whereupon the will thus renewed is not only actuated
          and influenced by God, but  in  consequence of this influence
          becomes itself active. Wherefore  also man himself is rightly
          said to believe and repent  by virtue of that grace received.
 
          THIRD AND  FOURTH  HEAD:  ARTICLE  13.  The  manner  of  this
          operation cannot be fully  comprehended  by believers in this
          life. Nevertheless, they are satisfied to know and experience
          that by this grace of  God  they  are enabled to believe with
          the heart and to love their Savior.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE  14.  Faith is therefore to be
          considered as the gift of  God,  not  on account of its being
          offered by God to  man,  to  be  accepted  or rejected at his
          pleasure, but because it  is  in  reality conferred upon him,
          breathed and infused into him;  nor  even because God bestows
          the power or ability  to  believe,  and then expects that man
          should by the exercise of  his  own  free will consent to the
          terms  of  salvation  and  actually  believe  in  Christ, but
          because He who works in  man  both  to  will and to work, and
          indeed all things in all,  produces  both the will to believe
          and the act of believing also.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE 15. God is under no obligation
          to confer this grace upon any;  for how can He be indebted to
          one who had no previous gifts  to  bestow as a foundation for
          such recompense? Nay, how can He  be  indebted to one who has
          nothing of his own but  sin and falsehood? He, therefore, who
          becomes the subject of this  grace  owes eternal gratitude to
          God, and  gives  Him  thanks  forever.  Whoever  is  not made
          partaker thereof is  either  altogether  regardless  of these
          spiritual gifts and satisfied with  his  own condition, or is
          in  no  apprehension  of   danger,   and  vainly  boasts  the
          possession of that which he has not. Further, with respect to
          those who  outwardly  profess  their  faith  and  amend their
          lives, we are bound,  after  the  example  of the apostle, to
          judge and speak of them in the most favorable manner; for the
          secret recesses of the heart  are  unknown  to  us. And as to
          others who have not yet been  called,  it is our duty to pray
          for them to God, who calls the things that are not as if they
          were. But we are in no wise to conduct ourselves towards them
          with haughtiness, as if we had made ourselves to differ.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE 16. But as man by the fall did
          not cease to be  a  creature  endowed  with understanding and
          will, nor did sin  which  pervaded  the whole race of mankind
          deprive him  of  the  human  nature,  but  brought  upon  him
          depravity  and  spiritual  death;   so  also  this  grace  of
          regeneration does  not  treat  men  as  senseless  stocks and
          blocks, nor take away  their  will  and  it properties, or do
          violence  thereto;  but   is   spiritually  quickens,  heals,
          corrects, and at the same  time  sweetly and powerfully bends
          it, that  where  carnal  rebellion  and  resistance  formerly
          prevailed, a ready and  sincere spiritual obedience begins to
          reign;  in  which  the  true  and  spiritual  restoration and
          freedom of our will  consist. Wherefore, unless the admirable
          Author of every good work  so  deal  with us, man can have no
          hope of being able  to  rise  from  his  fall by his own free
          will, by which, in a  state  of innocence, he plunged himself
          into ruin.
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: ARTICLE  17. As the almighty operation
          of God whereby He brings  forth and supports this our natural
          life does not exclude but require  the  use of means by which
          God, of His infinite mercy  and goodness, has chosen to exert
          His  influence,  so   also  the  aforementioned  supernatural
          operation of God by  which  we  are  regenerated  in  no wise
          excludes or subverts the  use  of  the gospel, which the most
          wise God has ordained to be the seed of regeneration and food
          of the soul. Wherefore, as  the apostles and the teachers who
          succeeded them piously instructed  the people concerning this
          grace of God, to His glory and to the abasement of all pride,
          and in the meantime, however,  neglected not to keep them, by
          the holy admonitions of  the  gospel,  under the influence of
          the Word, the sacraments,  and  ecclesiastical discipline; so
          even now it should  be  far  from  those  who give or receive
          instruction  in  the  Church  to  presume  to  tempt  God  by
          separating what He of His  good  pleasure has most intimately
          joined  together.  For  grace   is   conferred  by  means  of
          admonitions; and the more  readily  we  perform our duty, the
          more clearly  this  favor  of  God,  working  in  us, usually
          manifest itself, and the more  directly His work is advanced;
          to whom alone all the glory, both for the means and for their
          saving fruit and efficacy, is forever due. Amen.
 
          REJECTION OF ERRORS
 
          The true doctrine  having  been  explained, the Synod rejects
          the errors of those:
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 1. Who teach: That it cannot
          properly be said  that  original  sin  in  itself suffices to
          condemn the whole  human  race  or  to  deserve  temporal and
          eternal punishment.
 
          For these contradict the  apostle,  who declares: "Therefore,
          just as sin  entered  the  world  through  one man, and death
          through sin, and in this way  death  came to all men, because
          all sinned (Rom 5:12)." And:  "The  judgment followed one sin
          and brought condemnation (Rom 5:16)."  And  "the wages of sin
          is death (Rom 6:23)."
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH  HEAD:  PARAGRAPH  2.  Who  teach:  That the
          spiritual gifts or the  good  qualities  and virtues, such as
          goodness, holiness, righteousness,  could  not  belong to the
          will of  man  when  he  was  first  crated,  and  that these,
          therefore, cannot have been separated therefrom in the fall.
 
          For such is contrary to the  description  of the image of God
          which the apostle gives in  Eph. 4:24, where he declares that
          it consists in righteousness  and holiness, which undoubtedly
          belong to the will.
 
          THIRD AND  FOURTH  HEAD:  PARAGRAPH  3.  Who  teach:  That in
          spiritual death the spiritual gifts are not separate from the
          will  of  man,  since  the  will  in  itself  has  never been
          corrupted, but  only  hindered  through  the  darkness of the
          understanding and  the  irregularity  of  the  affection; and
          that, these hindrances having been removed, the will can then
          bring into operation its  nature  powers,  that  is, that the
          will of itself is able to will  and to choose, or not to will
          and not to choose, all manner  of good which may be presented
          to it.
 
          This is an innovation and an  error, and tends to elevate the
          powers of the free will,  contrary  to the declaration of the
          prophet: "The heart is deceitful  above all things and beyond
          cure (Jer 17:9)"; and of the  apostle:  "All of us also lived
          among them at one time, gratifying the cravings of our sinful
          nature and following its desires and thoughts (Eph 2:3)."
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH  HEAD:  PARAGRAPH  4.  Who  teach:  That the
          unregenerate man is not really  nor  utterly dead in sin, nor
          destitute of all powers unto  spiritual good, but that he can
          yet hunger and thirst after righteousness and life, and offer
          the sacrifice of  a  contrite  and  broken  spirit,  which is
          pleasing to God.
 
          For these things are  contrary  to  the  express testimony of
          Scripture: "you were  dead  in  your  transgressions and sins
          (Eph 2:1, 5)." And: "every inclination of the thoughts of his
          heart was only evil all the time. (Gen 6:5, 8:21)." Moreover,
          to hunger and thirst after  deliverance from misery and after
          life, and to offer unto God the sacrifice of a broken spirit,
          is peculiar to  the  regenerate  and  those  that  are called
          blessed (Ps 51:17; Matt 5:6).
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH  HEAD:  PARAGRAPH  5.  Who  teach:  That the
          corrupt and natural man can so  well use the common grace (by
          which they understand  the  light  of  nature),  or the gifts
          still left him after the fall,  that he can gradually gain by
          their good use a greater,  that is, the evangelical or saving
          grace, and salvation itself; and that  in this way God on His
          part shows Himself ready to reveal Christ unto all men, since
          He applies  to  all  sufficiently  and  efficiently the means
          necessary to conversion.
 
          For both  the  experience  of  all  ages  and  the Scriptures
          testify that this is  untrue.  "He  has  revealed his word to
          Jacob, his laws and decrees to  Israel.  He has done this for
          no other nation; they do  not know his laws (Psa 147:19-20)."
          "In the past, he  let  all  nations  go  their  own way (Acts
          14:16)." And: "Paul  and  his  companions traveled throughout
          the region of Phrygia  and  Galatia,  having been kept by the
          Holy Spirit from preaching the  word in the province of Asia.
          When they came to the  border  of  Mysia, they tried to enter
          Bithynia, but the Spirit  of  Jesus  would  not allow them to
          (Acts 16:6-7)."
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD:  PARAGRAPH  6.  Who teach: That in the
          true conversion of man no new qualities, powers, or gifts can
          be infused by God  into  the  will, and that therefore faith,
          through which we are first  converted and because of which we
          are called believers, is not a quality or gift infused by God
          but only an act of man,  and  that  it cannot be said to be a
          gift, except  in  respect  of  the  power  to  attain to this
          faith.
 
          For  thereby  they  contradict  the  Holy  Scriptures,  which
          declare  that  God  infuses   new   qualities  of  faith,  of
          obedience, and of  the  consciousness  of  His  love into our
          hearts: ""This is the covenant I  will make with the house of
          Israel after that time,"  declares  the  LORD. "I will put my
          law in their minds and write it on their hearts (Jer 31:33)."
          And: "For I will pour water  on the thirsty land, and streams
          on the  dry  ground;  I  will  pour  out  my  Spirit  on your
          offspring, and my blessing  on  your descendants (Isa 44:3)."
          And: "God has poured out his love into our hearts by the Holy
          Spirit, whom  he  has  given  us  (Rom  5:5)."  This  is also
          repugnant to the constant practice of the Church, which prays
          by the mouth of the  prophet  thus:  "Restore  me, and I will
          return (Jer 31:18)."
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 7. Who teach: That the grace
          whereby we are converted to God is only a gentle advising, or
          (as others explain it)  that  this  is  the noblest manner of
          working in the conversion  of  man,  and  that this manner of
          working, which consists in advising,  is most in harmony with
          man's nature; and that there  is  no reason why this advising
          grace alone should not be  sufficient to make the natural man
          spiritual; indeed, that God does  not  produce the consent of
          the will except through this manner of advising; and that the
          power of the divine working, whereby it surpasses the working
          of Satan, consists in this  that  God promises eternal, while
          Satan promise only temporal good.
 
          But this is altogether  Pelagian  and  contrary  to the whole
          Scripture, which, besides this,  teaches  yet another and far
          more powerful and divine manner  of the Holy Spirit's working
          in the conversion of man, as  in  Ezekiel: "I will give you a
          new heart and put a new spirit in you; I will remove from you
          your heart of stone  and  give  you  a  heart  of flesh (Ezek
          36:26)."
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD:  PARAGRAPH  8.  Who teach: That god in
          the regeneration of  man  does  not  use  such  powers of His
          omnipotence as potently  and  infallibly  bend  man's will to
          faith and conversion; but that  all the works of grace having
          been accomplished, which God employs  to convert man, man may
          yet so resist god and the Holy Spirit, when God intends man's
          regeneration and wills to regenerate him, and indeed that man
          often  does  so   resist   that   he  prevents  entirely  his
          regeneration, and that it therefore remains in man's power to
          be regenerated or not.
 
          For  this  is  nothing  less  than  the  denial  of  all that
          efficiency  of  God's  grace   in  our  conversion,  and  the
          subjecting of the working of Almighty God to the will of man,
          which is contrary to the  apostles, who teach that we believe
          accord to the  working  of  the  strength  of  his might (Eph
          1:19); and that God  fulfills  every  desire  of goodness and
          every work of faith with  power  (2  Th  1:11); and that "His
          divine power has given  us  everything  we  need for life and
          godliness (2 Pet 1:3)."
 
          THIRD AND FOURTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 9. Who teach: That grace and
          free  will  are  partial   causes  which  together  work  the
          beginning of conversion, and that grace, in order of working,
          does not precede the working of  the  will; that is, that God
          does not efficiently help  the  will  of  man unto conversion
          until the will of man moves and determines to do this.
 
          For the ancient Church has  long  ago condemned this doctrine
          of the Pelagians according to  the  words of the apostle: "It
          does not, therefore, depend on man's desire or effort, but on
          God's  mercy  (Rom  9:16)."  Likewise:  "For  who  makes  you
          different from anyone else? What do you have that you did not
          receive? And if you did receive it (1 Cor 4:7)?" And: "for it
          is God who works in you to  will  and to act according to his
          good purpose (Phil 2:13)."
 
          FIFTH HEAD OF DOCTRINE. THE PERSEVERANCE OF THE SAINTS
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE  1.  Those  whom  God,  according  to His
          purpose, calls to the  communion  of  His Son, our Lord Jesus
          Christ, and regenerates by the  Holy Spirit, He also delivers
          from the dominion and slavery of  sin, though in this life He
          does not deliver them  altogether  form  the  body of sin and
          from the infirmities of the flesh.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE 2. Hence  spring  forth the daily sins of
          infirmity, and blemishes cleave even to the best works of the
          saints. These are to  them  a  perpetual  reason to humiliate
          themselves before  God  and  to  flee  for  refuge  to Christ
          crucified; to mortify the flesh  more  and more by the spirit
          of prayer  and  by  holy  exercises  of  piety;  and to press
          forward to the goal of perfection, until at length, delivered
          from this body of death,  they  shall  reign with the Lamb of
          God in heaven.
 
          FIFTH  HEAD:  ARTICLE  3.  By  reason  of  these  remains  of
          indwelling sin, and also because the temptations of the world
          and of Satan, those who  are converted could not persevere in
          that  grace  if  left  to  their  own  strength.  But  God is
          faithful, who,  having  conferred  grace, mercifully confirms
          and powerfully preserves them therein, even to the end.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE 4.  Although  the  weakness  of the flesh
          cannot prevail against the  power  of  God, who  confirms and
          preserves true believers in  a  state  of grace, yet converts
          are not always so  influenced  and  actuated by the Spirit of
          God as not in some  particular  instances sinfully to deviate
          from the guidance of divine grace, so as to be seduced by and
          to comply with the lusts  of the flesh; they must, therefore,
          be constant in watching and prayer,  that they may not be led
          into temptation. When these are great and heinous sins by the
          flesh, the world, and Satan,  but  sometimes by the righteous
          permission of God actually are  drawn into these evils. This,
          the  lamentable  fall  of  David,  Peter,  and  other  saints
          described in Holy Scripture, demonstrates.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE 5. By  such  enormous sins, however, they
          very highly offend God, incur a deadly guilt, grieve the Holy
          Spirit, interrupt  the  exercise  of  faith,  very grievously
          wound their consciences, and sometimes  for  a while lose the
          sense of God's favor, until, when they change their course by
          serious repentance, the light  of  God's fatherly countenance
          again shines upon them.
 
          FIFTH HEAD:  ARTICLE  6.  But  God,  who  is  rich  in mercy,
          according to His unchangeable  purpose  of election, does not
          wholly withdraw the Holy Spirit  from  His own people even in
          their grievous falls; nor suffers them to proceed so far as t
          lose  the  grace  of  adoption   and  forfeit  the  state  of
          justification, or to commit the sin unto death or against the
          Holy Spirt; nor does He  permit  them to be totally deserted,
          and to plunge themselves into everlasting destruction.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE 7. For in the first place, in these falls
          He preserves in them  the  incorruptible seed of regeneration
          from perishing or being totally  lost; and again, by His Word
          and  Spirit  He  certainly  and  effectually  renews  them to
          repentance, to a sincere  and  godly  sorrow  for their sins,
          that they may seek and obtain  remission  in the blood of the
          Mediator, may again experience the favor of a reconciled God,
          through  faith  adore  His  mercies,  and  henceforward  more
          diligently  work  out  their  own  salvation  with  fear  and
          trembling.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE 8. Thus it is not in consequence of their
          own merits or strength,  but  of  God's free mercy, that they
          neither totally fall from  faith  and  grace nor continue and
          perish finally in their  backslidings; which, with respect to
          themselves  is  not  only  possible,  but  would  undoubtedly
          happen; but with respect  to  God,  it is utterly impossible,
          since His counsel cannot  be  changed  nor  His promise fail;
          neither can the call according to His purpose be revoked, nor
          the  merit,  intercession,  and  preservation  of  Christ  be
          rendered ineffectual, nor the sealing  of  the Holy Spirit be
          frustrated or obliterated.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE 9. Of  this  preservation of the elect to
          salvation  and  of  their  perseverance  in  the  faith, true
          believers themselves may and do obtain assurance according to
          the measure of their faith,  whereby they surely believe that
          they are and ever  will  continue  true and living members of
          the Church, and that  they  have  the forgiveness of sins and
          life eternal.
 
          FIFTH HEAD:  ARTICLE  10.  This  assurance,  however,  is not
          produced  by  any   peculiar   revelation   contrary   to  or
          independent of the Word  of  God,  but  springs from faith in
          God's promises, which He has  most abundantly revealed in His
          Word for our comfort; from  the testimony of the Holy Spirit,
          witnessing with our spirit that  we are children and heirs of
          God (Rom 8:16); and lastly, from a serious and holy desire to
          preserve a good conscience and  to perform good works. And if
          the elect of God  were  deprived  of  this solid comfort that
          they shall finally obtain the victory, and of this infallible
          pledge of eternal glory, they  would  be  of all men the most
          miserable.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE 11. The Scripture moreover testifies that
          believers in this life have  to  struggle with various carnal
          doubts, and  that  under  grievous  temptations  they  do not
          always feel this full  assurance  of  faith  and certainty of
          persevering. But God, who is  the  Father of all consolation,
          does not suffer them to be  tempted above that they are able,
          but will with the  temptation  make  also  the way of escape,
          that they may be able to endure  it (1 Cor 10:13), and by the
          Holy  Spirit  again  inspires   them   with  the  comfortable
          assurance of persevering.
 
          FIFTH HEAD:  ARTICLE  12.  This  certainty  of  perseverance,
          however, is so far  from  exciting  in  believers a spirit of
          pride, or of  rendering  them  carnally  secure,  that on the
          contrary it is the real source of humility, filial reverence,
          true piety, patience in  every  tribulation, fervent prayers,
          constancy in suffering and  in  confessing  the truth, and of
          solid rejoicing in God;  so  that  the  consideration of this
          benefit should serve  as  an  incentive  to  the  serious and
          constant practice of  gratitude  and  good  works, as appears
          from the testimonies of  Scripture  and  the  examples of the
          saints.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE  13.  Neither  does renewed confidence of
          persevering produce licentiousness or a disregard of piety in
          those who are recovered from backsliding; but it renders them
          much more careful and solicitous  to  continue in the ways of
          the Lord, which He has  ordained,  that they who walk therein
          may keep the assurance  of  persevering;  lest, on account of
          their abuse of His  fatherly  kindness,  God should turn away
          His gracious countenance from them (to behold which is to the
          godly dearer than life, and  the  withdrawal of which is more
          bitter than death)  and  they  in  consequence thereof should
          fall into more grievous torments of conscience.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: ARTICLE 14. And  as  it  has  pleased God, by the
          preaching of the gospel, to begin  this  work of grace in us,
          so He preserves, continues,  and  perfects  it by the hearing
          and reading of His  Word,  by  meditation thereon, and by the
          exhortations, threatenings, and promises  thereof, and by the
          use of the sacraments.
 
          FIFTH  HEAD:  ARTICLE  15.  The  carnal  mind  is  unable  to
          comprehend this doctrine  of  the  perseverance of the saints
          and the  certainty  thereof,  which  God  has most abundantly
          revealed in His Word,  for  the  glory  of  His  Name and the
          consolation of pious souls, and  which  He impresses upon the
          hearts of the believers. Satan abhors it, the world ridicules
          it, the ignorant and hypocritical  abuse it, and the heretics
          oppose it. But the bride  of  Christ has always most tenderly
          loved and constantly defended  it as an inestimable treasure;
          and  God,  against  whom  neither  counsel  nor  strength can
          prevail, will dispose her so to  continue  to the end. Now to
          this one God,  Father,  Son,  and  Holy  Spirit, be honor and
          glory forever. Amen.
 
          REJECTION OF ERRORS
 
          The true doctrine  having  been  explained, the Synod rejects
          the errors of those:
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 1. Who  teach: That the perseverance of
          the true believers is not a  fruit  of election, or a gift of
          God gained by the death of Christ, but a condition of the new
          covenant which  (as  they  declare)  man  before his decisive
          election and  justification  must  fulfil  through  his  free
          will.
 
          For the Holy Scripture  testifies  that  this  follows out of
          election, and is given the elect  in virtue of the death, the
          resurrection, and the  intercession  of  Christ: "What Israel
          sought so earnestly it did not obtain, but the elect did. The
          others were hardened (Rom 11:7)."  Likewise:  "He who did not
          spare His own Son, but gave  him  up  for us all--how will he
          not also, along with him,  graciously give us all things? Who
          will bring any charge against  those  whom God has chosen? It
          is God who justifies. Who  is he that condemns? Christ Jesus,
          who died--more than that, who  was  raised to life--is at the
          right hand of God and is  also  interceding for us. Who shall
          separate us from the love of Christ (Rom 8:32-35)?"
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH  2.  Who  teach:  That  God does indeed
          provide the believer with sufficient powers to persevere, and
          is ever ready to  preserve  these  in  him  if he will do his
          duty; but that,  though  all  though  which  are necessary to
          persevere in faith and which  God  will use to preserve faith
          are made us of, even then  it ever depends on the pleasure of
          the will whether it will persevere or not.
 
          For this idea  contains  outspoken  Pelagianism, and while it
          would make men free,  it  make  them  robbers of God's honor,
          contrary to  the  prevailing  agreement  of  the  evangelical
          doctrine, which takes from  man  all  cause  of boasting, and
          ascribes all the praise for  this  favor  to the grace of God
          alone; and contrary to the  apostle,  who declares that it is
          God, "He will keep you strong to the end, so that you will be
          blameless on the day of our Lord Jesus Christ (1 Cor 1:8)."
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 3. Who  teach:  That the true believers
          and regenerate not only  can  fall  from justifying faith and
          likewise from grace and salvation  wholly and to the end, but
          indeed often do fall from this and are lost forever.
 
          For this conception makes powerless the grace, justification,
          regeneration, and continued  preservation by Christ, contrary
          to the expressed words  of  the  apostle Paul: "While we were
          still sinners, Christ died  for  us.  Since  we have now been
          justified by his blood, how much  more shall we be saved from
          God's wrath through him  (Rom  5:8-9)."  And  contrary to the
          apostle John: "No one who  is  born  of  God will continue to
          sin, because God's  seed  remains  in  him;  he  cannot go on
          sinning, because he has been born  of  God (1 John 3:9)." And
          also contrary to  the  words  of  Jesus  Christ: "I give them
          eternal life, and they shall  never perish; no one can snatch
          them out of my hand. My Father,  who has given them to me, is
          greater than all ; no one  can snatch them out of my Father's
          hand (John 10:28-29)."
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 4. Who  teach:  That true believers and
          regenerate can sin the  sin  unto  death  or against the Holy
          Spirit.
 
          Since the same apostle John, after having spoken in the fifth
          chapter of his first epistle, vs. 16 and 17, of those who sin
          unto death and having forbidden to pray for them, immediately
          adds to this in vs. 18: "We know that anyone born of God does
          not continue to sin  (meaning  a  sin of that character); the
          one who was born  of  God  keeps  him  safe, and the evil one
          cannot harm him (1 John 5:18)."
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 5.  Who  teach:  That without a special
          revelation we can have no certainty of future perseverance in
          this life.
 
          For by this doctrine the  sure  comfort of the true believers
          is taken away in this life,  and the doubts of the papist are
          again introduced into the  Church,  while the Holy Scriptures
          constantly deduce  this  assurance,  not  from  a special and
          extraordinary revelation, but  from  the  marks proper to the
          children of God and from  the  very constant promises of God.
          So especially the  apostle  Paul:  "neither height nor depth,
          nor anything else in all  creation,  will be able to separate
          us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord (Rom
          8:39)." And John declares: "Those  who obey his commands live
          in him, and he in them. And this is how we know that he lives
          in us: We know it by the Spirit he gave us (1 John 3:24)."
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 6. Who  teach: That the doctrine of the
          certainty of  perseverance  and  of  salvation  from  its own
          character and nature is a cause of indolence and is injurious
          to godliness, good morals, prayers, and other holy exercises,
          but that on the contrary it is praiseworthy to doubt.
 
          For these show that  they  do  not  know  the power of divine
          grace and the working of the indwelling Holy Spirit. And they
          contradict the apostle John,  who  teaches that opposite with
          express words in his first epistle: "Dear friends, now we are
          children of God, and what  we  will  be has not yet been made
          known. But we know that  when  he  appears,  we shall be like
          him, for we shall see  him  as  he  is. Everyone who has this
          hope in him purifies  himself,  just  as  he  is pure (1 John
          3:2-3)." Furthermore, these are  contradicted  by the example
          of the saints, both of  the  Old  and  the New Testament, who
          though they were assured of their perseverance and salvation,
          were nevertheless constant in  prayers and other exercises of
          godliness.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 7. Who  teach:  That the faith of those
          who believe for a  time  does  not differ from justifying and
          saving faith except only in duration.
 
          For Christ Himself, in  Matt  13:20,  Luke 8:13, and in other
          places, evidently notes,  beside  this  duration, a threefold
          difference between those who believe only for a time and true
          believers, when He declares that  the former receive the seed
          on stony ground, but the latter  in the good ground or heart;
          that the former are without root,  but the latter have a firm
          root; that the former are  without fruit, but that the latter
          bring forth their  fruit  in  various measure, with constancy
          and steadfastness.
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 8.  Who  teach:  That  it is not absurd
          that one having lost his first regeneration is again and even
          often born anew.
 
          For these deny by this  doctrine the incorruptibleness of the
          seed of God,  whereby  we  are  born  again;  contrary to the
          testimony of the  apostle  Peter:  "For  you  have  been born
          again, not of perishable  seed,  but  of  imperishable (1 Pet
          1:23)."
 
          FIFTH HEAD: PARAGRAPH 9.  Who  teach:  That  Christ has in no
          place prayed that  believers  should  infallibly  continue in
          faith.
 
          For the contradict Christ Himself,  who  says: "I have prayed
          for you, Simon, that your  faith  may not fail (Luke 22:32)",
          and the evangelist John,  who  declares  that  Christ has not
          prayed for the apostles only,  but also for those who through
          their word would believe: "Holy  Father,  protect them by the
          power of your name," and "My prayer is not that you take them
          out of the world but that  you protect them from the evil one
          (John 17:11, 15, 20)."
 
          CONCLUSION
 
          And this is the perspicuous, simple, an ingenuous declaration
          of the orthodox doctrine  respecting the five articles  which
          have  been  controverted  in  the  Belgic  Churches;  and the
          rejection of the errors, with  which  they have for some time
          been troubled. This doctrine  the  Synod  judges  to be drawn
          from the Word of God, and  to  be agreeable to the confession
          of the  Reformed  Churches.  Whence  it  clearly appears that
          some, whom such conduct by no means became, have violated all
          truth,  equity,  and  charity,  in  wishing  to  persuade the
          public:
 
          "That  the  doctrine  of  the  Reformed  Churches  concerning
          predestination, and the  points  annexed  to  it,  by its own
          genius and necessary tendency,  leads  off  the  minds of men
          from all piety and religion; that it is a opiate administered
          by the flesh  and  the  devil;  and  the stronghold of Satan,
          where he lies in  wait  for  all,  and  from  which he wounds
          multitudes, and mortally strikes  through many with the darts
          both of despair and security; that it makes God the author of
          sin, unjust, tyrannical, hypocritical; that it is noting more
          than interpolated Stoicism, Manicheism, Libertinism, Turcism;
          that it renders men carnally secure, since they are persuaded
          by it that noting can hinder  the salvation of the elect, let
          them live as  they  please;  and,  therefore,  that  they may
          safely perpetrate every species of the most atrocious crimes;
          and that, if the reprobate  should even perform truly all the
          works of the saints, their  obedience  would not in the least
          contribute  tot  their  salvation;  that  the  same  doctrine
          teaches that  God,  by  a  mere  arbitrary  act  of his will,
          without  the  least  respect   or   view   to  any  sin,  has
          predestinated the  greatest  part  of  the  world  to eternal
          damnation, and has created them  for  this very purpose; that
          in the same manner in which  the election is the fountain and
          cause of faith and  good  works,  reprobation is the cause of
          unbelief and impiety; that many  children of the faithful are
          torn,   guiltless,   from   their   mothers'   breasts,   and
          tyrannically plunged into hell:  so  that neither baptism nor
          the prayers of the Church at  their baptism can at all profit
          them;" and many  other  things  of  the  same  kind which the
          Reformed Churches  not  only  do  not  acknowledge,  but even
          detest with their whole soul.
 
          Wherefore, this Synod  of  Dort,  in  the  name  of the Lord,
          conjures as many as piously call  upon the name of our Savior
          Jesus Christ to judge of  the faith of the Reformed Churches,
          not from the calumnies  which  on  every side are heaped upon
          it, nor from the private  expressions  of a few among ancient
          and modern teachers, often  dishonestly  quoted, or corrupted
          and wrested to a  meaning  quite  foreign to their intention;
          but from the public  confessions  of the Churches themselves,
          and from this declaration of the orthodox doctrine, confirmed
          by the unanimous consent of  all  and  each of the members of
          the whole  Synod.  Moreover,  the  Synod  warns  calumniators
          themselves to consider  the  terrible  judgment  of God which
          awaits  them,  for   bearing   false   witness   against  the
          confessions  of  so  many   Churches;   for  distressing  the
          consciences of the weak; and for laboring to render suspected
          the society of the truly faithful.
 
          Finally, this Synod exhorts all  their brethren in the gospel
          of Christ to  conduct  themselves  piously and religiously in
          handling  this  doctrine,  both   in   the  universities  and
          churches; to direct it, as  well  in discourse as in writing,
          to the glory of the Divine  name, to holiness of life, and to
          the consolation  of  afflicted  souls;  to  regulate,  by the
          Scripture, according to the analogy  of faith, not only their
          sentiments, but also their language,  and to abstain from all
          those  phrases  which  exceed  the  limits  necessary  to  be
          observed  in  ascertaining  the  genuine  sense  of  the Holy
          Scriptures, and may  furnish  insolent  sophists  with a just
          pretext for  violently  assailing,  or  even  vilifying,  the
          doctrine of the Reformed Churches.
 
          May Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who, seated at the Father's
          right hand, gives gifts  to  men,  sanctify  us in the truth;
          bring to the truth  those  who  err;  shut  the mouths of the
          calumniators  of  sound  doctrine,  and  endue  the  faithful
          ministers  of  his  Word  with   the  spirit  of  wisdom  and
          discretion, that all their discourses  may  tend to the glory
          of God, and the edification of those who hear them. Amen.
