 <h1 align="CENTER">Chapter IV - Christian Science Versus Spiritualism</h1>
 <p></p><p><a name="pg_70"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 70</font></a></p><p></p><p>And when they shall say unto you,<br>
 Seek unto them that have familiar spirits,<br>
 And unto wizards that peep and that mutter;<br>
 Should not a people seek unto their God?--ISAIAH.<br>
 </p><p>Verily, verily, I say unto you, If a man keep my saying, he shall never

 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The infinite one Spirit</font></p>
 MORTAL existence is an enigma. Every day is a
 mystery. The testimony of the corporeal senses
 cannot inform us what is real and what is delusive, but
 the revelations of Christian Science unlock the treasures
 of Truth. Whatever is false or sinful can
 never enter the atmosphere of Spirit. There
 is but one Spirit. Man is never God, but spiritual man,
 made in God's likeness, reflects God. In this scientific
 reflection the Ego and the Father are inseparable. The
 supposition that corporeal beings are spirits, or that there
 are good and evil spirits, is a mistake.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Real and unreal identity</font></p>
 The divine Mind maintains all identities, from a blade
 of grass to a star, as distinct and eternal. The
 questions are: What are God's identities?
 What is Soul? Does life or soul exist in the thing
 formed?
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_71"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 71</font></a></p><p></p><p>Nothing is real and eternal,--nothing is Spirit,--but 
 God and His idea. Evil has no reality. It is neither
 person, place, nor thing, but is simply a belief, an illusion 
 of material sense.
 </p><p></p><p>The identity, or idea, of all reality continues forever;
 but Spirit, or the divine Principle of all, is not in Spirit's 
 formations. Soul is synonymous with Spirit, God, the
 creative, governing, infinite Principle outside of finite form,
 which forms only reflect.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Dream-lessons</font></p>
 Close your eyes, and you may dream that you see a
 flower,--that you touch and smell it. Thus you learn
 that the flower is a product of the so-called 
 mind, a formation of thought rather than of 
 matter. Close your eyes again, and you may see landscapes, men, and women. Thus you learn that these
 also are images, which mortal mind holds and evolves
 and which simulate mind, life, and intelligence. From
 dreams also you learn that neither mortal mind nor 
 matter is the image or likeness of God, and that immortal Mind is not in matter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Found wanting</font></p>
 When the Science of Mind is understood, spiritualism 
 will be found mainly erroneous, having no scientific basis
 nor origin, no proof nor power outside of  
 human testimony. It is the offspring of the 
 physical senses. There is no sensuality in Spirit. I never
 could believe in spiritualism.
 <p></p><p>The basis and structure of spiritualism are alike material and physical. Its spirits are so many corporealities,
 limited and finite in character and quality. Spiritualism
 therefore presupposes Spirit, which is ever infinite, to be
 a corporeal being, a finite form,--a theory contrary to
 Christian Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_72%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 72 </font></a></p><p></p><p>There is but one spiritual existence,--the Life of
 which corporeal sense can take no cognizance. The
 divine Principle of man speaks through immortal sense.
 If a material body--in other words, mortal, material
 sense--were permeated by Spirit, that body would
 disappear to mortal sense, would be deathless. A condition precedent to communion with Spirit is the gain of
 spiritual life.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirits obsolete</font></p>
 So-called spirits are but corporeal communicators. As
 light destroys darkness and in the place of darkness all
 is light, so (in absolute Science) Soul, or God,
 is the only truth-giver to man. Truth destroys mortality, and brings to light immortality. Mortal
 belief (the material sense of life) and immortal Truth
 (the spiritual sense) are the tares and the wheat, which
 are not united by progress, but separated.
 <p></p><p>Perfection is not expressed through imperfection.
 Spirit is not made manifest through matter, the antipode of Spirit. Error is not a convenient sieve through
 which truth can be strained.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific phenomena</font></p>
 God, good, being ever present, it follows in divine
 logic that evil, the suppositional opposite of good, is never
 present. In Science, individual good derived
 from God, the infinite All-in-all, may flow
 from the departed to mortals; but evil is neither communicable nor scientific. A sinning, earthly mortal is
 not the reality of Life nor the medium through which
 truth passes to earth. The joy of intercourse becomes
 the jest of sin, when evil and suffering are communicable.
 Not personal intercommunion but divine law is the communicator of truth, health, and harmony to earth and
 humanity. As readily can you mingle fire and frost as
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_73"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 73</font></a></p><p></p><p>Spirit and matter. In either case, one does not support 
 the other.
 </p><p></p><p>Spiritualism calls one person, living in this world, material, but another, who has died to-day a sinner and supposedly will return to earth to-morrow, it terms a spirit.
 The fact is that neither the one nor the other is infinite
 Spirit, for Spirit is God, and man is His likeness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">One government</font></p>
 The belief that one man, as spirit, can control another man, as matter, upsets both the individuality and 
 the Science of man, for man is image. God 
 controls man, and God is the only Spirit. Any 
 other control or attraction of so-called spirit is a mortal 
 belief, which ought to be known by its fruit, - the repetition of evil.
 <p></p><p>If Spirit, or God, communed with mortals or controlled 
 them through electricity or any other form of matter, the
 divine order and the Science of omnipotent, omnipresent
 Spirit would be destroyed.  
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Incorrect theories      </font></p>
 The belief that material bodies return to dust, hereafter
 to rise up as spiritual bodies with material sensations and
 desires, is incorrect. Equally incorrect is the
 belief that spirit is confined in a finite, material body, from which it is freed by death, and that, when
 it is freed from the material body, spirit retains the sensations belonging to that body.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No mediumship</font></p>
 It is a grave mistake to suppose that matter is any part
 of the reality of intelligent existence, or that Spirit and 
 matter, intelligence and non-intelligence, can 
 commune together. This error Science will  
 destroy. The sensual cannot be made the mouthpiece of
 the spiritual, nor can the finite become the channel of
 the infinite. There is no communication between so<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_74%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 74 </font></a></p><p></p><p>called material existence and spiritual life which is not
 subject to death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Opposing conditions</font></p>
 To be on communicable terms with Spirit, persons must
 be free from organic bodies; and their return to a material condition, after having once left it, would
 be as impossible as would be the restoration
 to its original condition of the acorn, already absorbed
 into a sprout which has risen above the soil. The seed
 which has germinated has a new form and state of existence. When here or hereafter the belief of life in matter
 is extinct, the error which has held the belief dissolves
 with the belief, and never returns to the old condition.
 No correspondence nor communion can exist between
 persons in such opposite dreams as the belief of having
 died and left a material body and the belief of still living
 in an organic, material body.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Bridgeless division</font></p>
 The caterpillar, transformed into a beautiful insect,
 is no longer a worm, nor does the insect return to
 fraternize with or control the worm. Such
 a backward transformation is impossible in
 Science. Darkness and light, infancy and manhood,
 sickness and health, are opposites,--different beliefs,
 which never blend. Who will say that infancy can utter
 the ideas of manhood, that darkness can represent light,
 that we are in Europe when we are in the opposite hemisphere? There is no bridge across the gulf which divides
 two such opposite conditions as the spiritual, or incorporeal, and the physical, or corporeal.
 <p></p><p>In Christian Science there is never a retrograde step,
 never a return to positions outgrown. The so-called dead
 and living cannot commune together, for they are in
 separate states of existence, or consciousness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_75"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 75</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unscientific investiture</font></p>
 This simple truth lays bare the mistaken assumption 
 that man dies as matter but comes to life as spirit. The
 so-called dead, in order to reappear to those 
 still in the existence cognized by the physical
 senses, would need to be tangible and material,--to have
 a material investiture,--or the material senses could take 
 no cognizance of the so-called dead.
 <p></p><p>Spiritualism would transfer men from the spiritual sense
 of existence back into its material sense. This gross materialism is scientifically impossible, since to infinite Spirit
 there can be no matter.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Raising the dead</font></p>
 Jesus said of Lazarus: "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth; 
 but I go, that I may awake him out of sleep." Jesus
 restored Lazarus by the understanding that 
 Lazarus had never died, not by an admission that his body had died and then lived again. Had
 Jesus believed that Lazarus had lived or died in his
 body, the Master would have stood on the same plane of 
 belief as those who buried the body, and he could not have
 resuscitated it.
 <p></p><p>When you can waken yourself or others out of the belief
 that all must die, you can then exercise Jesus' spiritual
 power to reproduce the presence of those who have thought
 they died,--but not otherwise.
   
 </p><p><font size="1">Vision of the dying      </font></p>
 There is one possible moment, when those living on the
 earth and those called dead, can commune together, and
 that is the moment previous to the transition, 
 - the moment when the link between their opposite beliefs is being sundered. In the vestibule through
 which we pass from one dream to another dream, or 
 when we awake from earth's sleep to the grand verities
 of Life, the departing may hear the glad welcome of those
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_76%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 76 </font></a></p><p></p><p>who have gone before. The ones departing may whisper
 this vision, name the face that smiles on them and the
 hand which beckons them, as one at Niagara, with eyes
 open only to that wonder, forgets all else and breathes
 aloud his rapture.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Real Life is God</font></p>
 When being is understood, Life will be recognized as
 neither material nor finite, but as infinite,--as God,
 universal good; and the belief that life, or
 mind, was ever in a finite form, or good in
 evil, will be destroyed. Then it will be understood that
 Spirit never entered matter and was therefore never
 raised from matter. When advanced to spiritual being
 and the understanding of God, man can no longer commune with matter; neither can he return to it, any more
 than a tree can return to its seed. Neither will man seem
 to be corporeal, but he will be an individual consciousness, characterized by the divine Spirit as idea, not matter.
 Suffering, sinning, dying beliefs are  unreal.  When
 divine Science is universally understood, they will have
 no power over man, for man is immortal and lives by
 divine authority.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Immaterial pleasure</font></p>
 The sinless joy,--the perfect harmony and immortality
 of Life, possessing unlimited divine beauty and goodness
 without a single bodily pleasure or pain, constitutes the only veritable, indestructible
 man, whose being is spiritual. This state of existence
 is scientific and intact,--a perfection discernible only
 by those who have the final understanding of Christ in
 divine Science. Death can never hasten this state of
 existence, for death must be overcome, not submitted to,
 before immortality appears.
 <p></p><p>The recognition of Spirit and of infinity comes not
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_77"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 77</font></a></p><p></p><p>suddenly here or hereafter. The pious Polycarp said: 
 "I cannot turn at once from good to evil." Neither do
 other mortals accomplish the change from error to truth 
 at a single bound.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Second death</font></p>
 Existence continues to be a belief of corporeal sense
 until the Science of being is reached. Error brings its 
 own self-destruction both here and hereafter, 
 for mortal mind creates its own physical conditions. Death will occur on the next plane of existence 
 as on this, until the spiritual understanding of Life is
 reached. Then, and not until then, will it be demonstrated that "the second death hath no power." 
     
 <p><font size="1">A dream vanishing</font></p>
 The period required for this dream of material life,
 embracing its so-called pleasures and pains, to vanish
 from consciousness, "knoweth no man . . . 
 neither the Son, but the Father." This period 
 will be of longer or shorter duration according to the
 tenacity of error. Of what advantage, then, would it be
 to us, or to the departed, to prolong the material state and
 so prolong the illusion either of a soul inert or of a sinning,
 suffering sense,--a so-called mind fettered to matter. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Progress and purgatory  </font></p>
 Even if communications from spirits to mortal consciousness were possible, such communications would
 grow beautifully less with every advanced stage 
 of existence. The departed would gradually 
 rise above ignorance and materiality, and Spiritualists
 would outgrow their beliefs in material spiritualism. 
 Spiritism consigns the so-called dead to a state resembling
 that of blighted buds,--to a wretched purgatory, where
 the chances of the departed for improvement narrow 
 into nothing and they return to their old standpoints of
 matter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_78%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 78 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unnatural deflections</font></p>
 The decaying flower, the blighted bud, the gnarled oak,
 the ferocious beast,--like the discords of disease, sin,
 and death, - are unnatural. They are the falsities of sense, the changing deflections of mortal mind; they are not the eternal realities of Mind.
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Absurd oracles</font></p>
 How unreasonable is the belief that we are wearing
 out life and hastening to death, and that at the same
 time we are communing with immortality!
 If the departed are in rapport with mortality, or matter, they are not spiritual, but must still
 be mortal, sinning, suffering, and dying. Then why
 look to them--even were communication possible--for
 proofs of immortality, and accept them as oracles? Communications gathered from ignorance are pernicious in
 tendency.
 <p></p><p>Spiritualism with its material accompaniments would
 destroy the supremacy of Spirit. If Spirit pervades all
 space, it needs no material method for the transmission
 of messages. Spirit needs no wires nor electricity in order
 to be omnipresent.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit intangible</font></p>
 Spirit is not materially tangible.  How then can it
 communicate with man through electric, material effects?
 How can the majesty and omnipotence of
 Spirit be lost? God is not in the medley
 where matter cares for matter, where spiritism makes
 many gods, and hypnotism and electricity are claimed
 to be the agents of God's government.
 <p></p><p>Spirit blesses man, but man cannot "tell whence
 it cometh." By it the sick are healed, the sorrowing are
 comforted, and the sinning are reformed. These are the
 effects of one universal God, the invisible good dwelling
 in eternal Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_79"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 79</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Thought regarding death</font></p>
 The act of describing disease--its symptoms, locality, 
 and fatality--is not scientific. Warning people against
 death is an error that tends to frighten into
 death those who are ignorant of Life as God. 
 Thousands of instances could be cited of health restored
 by changing the patient's thoughts regarding death. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fallacious hypotheses</font></p>
 A scientific mental method is more sanitary than the
 use of drugs, and such a mental method produces permanent health. Science must go over the whole 
 ground, and dig up every seed of error's sowing. Spiritualism relies upon human beliefs and hypotheses. Christian Science removes these beliefs and
 hypotheses through the higher understanding of God, for
 Christian Science, resting on divine Principle, not on material personalities, in its revelation of immortality, introduces the harmony of being.
 <p></p><p>Jesus cast out evil spirits, or false beliefs. The Apostle
 Paul bade men have the Mind that was in the Christ.
 Jesus did his own work by the one Spirit. He said: "My
 Father worketh hitherto, and I work." He never described disease, so far as can be learned from the Gospels,
 but he healed disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mistaken methods</font></p>
 The unscientific practitioner says: "You are ill. Your
 brain is overtaxed, and you must rest. Your body is 
 weak, and it must be strengthened. You have
 nervous prostration, and must be treated for it." 
 Science objects to all this, contending for the rights of intelligence and asserting that Mind controls body and brain.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine strength</font></p>
 Mind-science teaches that mortals need "not be weary
 in well doing." It dissipates fatigue in doing
 good. Giving does not impoverish us in the 
 service of our Maker, neither does withholding enrich us.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_80%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 80 </font></a></p><p></p><p>We have strength in proportion to our apprehension of
 the truth, and our strength is not lessened by giving
 utterance to truth. A cup of coffee or tea is not the equal
 of truth, whether for the inspiration of a sermon or for
 the support of bodily endurance.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A denial of immortality</font></p>
 A communication purporting to come from the late
 Theodore Parker reads as follows: "There never was,
 and there never will be, an immortal spirit."
 Yet the very periodical containing this sentence repeats weekly the assertion that spirit-communications are our only proofs of immortality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mysticism unscientific</font></p>
 I entertain no doubt of the humanity and philanthropy
 of many Spiritualists, but I cannot coincide with their
 views. It is mysticism which gives spiritualism its force. Science dispels mystery and
 explains extraordinary phenomena; but Science never
 removes phenomena from the domain of reason into the
 realm of mysticism.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Physical falsities</font></p>
 It should not seem mysterious that mind, without the
 aid of hands, can move a table, when we already know
 that it is mind-power which moves both table
 and hand. Even planchette--the French toy
 which years ago pleased so many people - attested the control of mortal mind over its substratum, called matter.
 <p></p><p>It is mortal mind which convulses its substratum, matter.
 These movements arise from the volition of human belief,
 but they are neither scientific nor rational. Mortal mind
 produces table-tipping as certainly as table-setting, and
 believes that this wonder emanates from spirits and electricity. This belief rests on the common conviction that
 mind and matter cooperate both visibly and invisibly,
 hence that matter is intelligent.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_81"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 81</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Poor post-mortem evidence</font></p>
 There is not so much evidence to prove intercommunication between the so-called dead and the living, as there
 is to show the sick that matter suffers and has 
 sensation; yet this latter evidence is destroyed by
 the Mind-science. If Spiritualists understood the
 Science of being, their belief in mediumship would vanish. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No proof of immortality</font></p>
 At the very best and on its own theories, spiritualism
 can only prove that certain individuals have a continued
 existence after death and maintain their affiliation with mortal flesh; but this fact affords
 no certainty of everlasting life. A man's assertion that
 he is immortal no more proves him to be so, than the opposite assertion, that he is mortal, would prove immortality a lie. Nor is the case improved when alleged spirits
 teach immortality. Life, Love, Truth, is the only proof 
 of immortality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind's manifestations immortal</font></p>
 Man in the likeness of God as revealed in Science cannot help being immortal. Though the grass seemeth to 
 wither and the flower to fade, they reappear.
 Erase the figures which express number, silence 
 the tones of music, give to the worms the body
 called man, and yet the producing, governing, divine
 Principle lives on,--in the case of man as truly as in
 the case of numbers and of music,--despite the so-called 
 laws of matter, which define man as mortal. Though
 the inharmony resulting from material sense hides the
 harmony of Science, inharmony cannot destroy the divine
 Principle of Science. In Science, man's immortality depends upon that of God, good, and follows as a necessary
 consequence of the immortality of good.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reading thoughts     </font></p>
 That somebody, somewhere, must have known the
 deceased person, supposed to be the communicator, is
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_82%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82 </font></a></p><p></p><p>evident, and it is as easy to read distant thoughts as near.
 We think of an absent friend as easily as we do of one
 present. It is no more difficult to read the
 absent mind than it is to read the present.
 Chaucer wrote centuries ago, yet we still read his thought
 in his verse. What is classic study, but discernment of
 the minds of Homer and Virgil, of whose personal existence we may be in doubt?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Impossible intercommunion</font></p>
 If spiritual life has been won by the departed, they
 cannot return to material existence, because different
 states of consciousness are involved, and one
 person cannot exist in two different states of
 consciousness at the same time. In sleep we
 do not communicate with the dreamer by our side despite
 his physical proximity, because both of us are either unconscious or are wandering in our dreams through different mazes of consciousness.
 <p></p><p>In like manner it would follow, even if our departed
 friends were near us and were in as conscious a state of
 existence as before the change we call death, that their
 state of consciousness must be different from ours. We
 are not in their state, nor are they in the mental realm
 in which we dwell. Communion between them and
 ourselves would be prevented by this difference. The
 mental states are so unlike, that intercommunion is as
 impossible as it would be between a mole and a human
 being. Different dreams and different awakenings betoken a differing consciousness. When wandering in
 Australia, do we look for help to the Esquimaux in their
 snow huts?
 </p><p></p><p>In a world of sin and sensuality hastening to a
 greater development of power, it is wise earnestly to
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_83"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 83</font></a></p><p></p><p>consider whether it is the human mind or the divine
 Mind which is influencing one. What the prophets of
 Jehovah did, the worshippers of Baal failed to do; yet 
 artifice and delusion claimed that they could equal the
 work of wisdom.
 </p><p></p><p>Science only can explain the incredible good and evil 
 elements now coming to the surface. Mortals must find
 refuge in Truth in order to escape the error of these latter
 days. Nothing is more antagonistic to Christian Science 
 than a blind belief without understanding, for such a
 belief hides Truth and builds on error.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Natural wonders</font></p>
 Miracles are impossible in Science, and here Science 
 takes issue with popular religions. The scientific manifestation of power is from the divine nature
 and is not supernatural, since Science is an 
 explication of nature. The belief that the universe, including man, is governed in general by material laws, but
 that occasionally Spirit sets aside these laws, - this belief belittles omnipotent wisdom, and gives to matter the
 precedence over Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Conflicting standpoints</font></p>
 It is contrary to Christian Science to suppose that life
 is either material or organically spiritual.  Between
 Christian Science and all forms of superstition 
 a great gulf is fixed, as impassable as that between Dives and Lazarus. There is mortal mind-reading
 and immortal Mind-reading. The latter is a revelation
 of divine purpose through spiritual understanding, by 
 which man gains the divine Principle and explanation of
 all things. Mortal mind-reading and immortal Mindreading are distinctly opposite standpoints, from which
 cause and effect are interpreted. The act of reading
 mortal mind investigates and touches only human beliefs.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_84%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 84 </font></a></p><p></p><p>Science is immortal and coordinate neither with the
 premises nor with the conclusions of mortal beliefs.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific foreseeing</font></p>
 The ancient prophets gained their foresight from a
 spiritual, incorporeal standpoint, not by foreshadowing
 evil and mistaking fact for fiction, - predicting the future from a groundwork of corporeality and human belief. When sufficiently advanced
 in Science to be in harmony with the truth of being, men
 become seers and prophets involuntarily, controlled not
 by demons, spirits, or demigods, but by the one Spirit.
 It is the prerogative of the ever-present, divine Mind, and
 of thought which is in rapport with this Mind, to know
 the past, the present, and the future.
 <p></p><p>Acquaintance with the Science of being enables us to
 commune more largely with the divine Mind, to foresee
 and foretell events which concern the universal welfare,
 to be divinely inspired, - yea, to reach the range of fetterless Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The Mind unbounded</font></p>
 To understand that Mind is infinite, not bounded by
 corporeality, not dependent upon the ear and eye for
 sound or sight nor upon muscles and bones
 for locomotion, is a step towards the Mindscience by which we discern man's nature and existence.
 This true conception of being destroys the belief of spiritualism at its very inception, for without the concession of
 material personalities called spirits, spiritualism has no
 basis upon which to build.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific foreknowing</font></p>
 All we correctly know of Spirit comes from God, divine
 Principle, and is learned through Christ and Christian
 Science. If this Science has been thoroughly
 learned and properly digested, we can know
 the truth more accurately than the astronomer can read
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_85"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 85</font></a></p><p></p><p>the stars or calculate an eclipse. This Mind-reading 
 is the opposite of clairvoyance. It is the illumination of
 the spiritual understanding which demonstrates the capacity of Soul, not of material sense. This Soul-sense
 comes to the human mind when the latter yields to the
 divine Mind.          
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Value of intuition</font></p>
 Such intuitions reveal whatever constitutes and perpetuates harmony, enabling one to do good, but not
 evil. You will reach the perfect Science of
 healing when you are able to read the human 
 mind after this manner and discern the error you would
 destroy. The Samaritan woman said: "Come, see a 
 man, which told me all things that ever I did: is not this
 the Christ?"
 <p></p><p>It is recorded that Jesus, as he once journeyed with his 
 students, "knew their thoughts," - read them scientifically. In like manner he discerned disease and healed
 the sick. After the same method, events of great moment were foretold by the Hebrew prophets. Our
 Master rebuked the lack of this power when he said:
 "O ye hypocrites! ye can discern the face of the sky; 
 but can ye not discern the signs of the times?"
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Hyprocrisy condemned</font></p>
 Both Jew and Gentile may have had acute corporeal
 senses, but mortals need spiritual sense. Jesus knew the 
 generation to be wicked and adulterous, seeking the material more than the spiritual. His 
 thrusts at materialism were sharp, but needed. He never 
 spared hypocrisy the sternest condemnation..  He said :
 "These ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
 undone." The great Teacher knew both cause and 
 effect, knew that truth communicates itself but never
 imparts error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_86%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 86 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental contact</font></p>
 Jesus once asked, "Who touched me?" Supposing 
 this inquiry to be occasioned by physical contact alone,
 his disciples answered, "The multitude throng
 thee." Jesus knew, as others did not, that
 it was not matter, but mortal mind, whose touch called
 for aid. Repeating his inquiry, he was answered by the
 faith of a sick woman. His quick apprehension of this
 mental call illustrated his spirituality. The disciples'
 misconception of it uncovered their materiality. Jesus
 possessed more spiritual susceptibility than the disciples.
 Opposites come from contrary directions, and produce
 unlike results.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Images of thought</font></p>
 Mortals evolve images of thought. These may appear
 to the ignorant to be apparitions; but they are mysterious only because it is unusual to see
 thoughts, though we can always feel their
 influence. Haunted houses, ghostly voices, unusual
 noises, and apparitions brought out in dark seances
 either involve feats by tricksters, or they are images and
 sounds evolved involuntarily by mortal mind. Seeing
 is no less a quality of physical sense than feeling. Then
 why is it more difficult to see a thought than to feel one?
 Education alone determines the difference. In reality
 there is none.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Phenomena explained</font></p>
 Portraits, landscape-paintings, fac-similes of penmanship, peculiarities of expression, recollected sentences,
 can all be taken from pictorial thought and
 memory as readily as from objects cognizable
 by the senses. Mortal mind sees what it believes as
 certainly as it believes what it sees. It feels, hears, and
 sees its own thoughts.  Pictures are mentally formed
 before the artist can convey them to canvas. So is it
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_87"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 87</font></a></p><p></p><p>with all material conceptions. Mind-readers perceive
 these pictures of thought. They copy or reproduce
 them, even when they are lost to the memory of the mind
 in which they are discoverable.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental environment</font></p>
 It is needless for the thought or for the person holding the transferred picture to be individually and consciously present. Though individuals have
 passed away, their mental environment re-  
 mains to be discerned, described, and transmitted. Though
 bodies are leagues apart and their associations forgotten,
 their associations float in the general atmosphere of human
 mind. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Second sight  </font></p>
 The Scotch call such vision "second sight", when
 really it is first sight instead of second, for it presents
 primal facts to mortal mind. Science enables 
 one to read the human mind, but not as a 
 clairvoyant. It enables one to heal through Mind, but
 not as a mesmerist.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Buried secrets </font></p>
 The mine knows naught of the emeralds within its
 rocks; the sea is ignorant of the gems within its caverns,
 of the corals, of its sharp reefs, of the tall ships
 that float on its bosom, or of the bodies which 
 lie buried in its sands: yet these are all there. Do not
 suppose that any mental concept is gone because you do 
 not think of it. The true concept is never lost. The
 strong impressions produced on mortal mind by friendship or by any intense feeling are lasting, and mindreaders can perceive and reproduce these impressions.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Recollected friends</font></p>
 Memory may reproduce voices long ago silent. We
 have but to close the eyes, and forms rise 
 before us, which are thousands of miles away 
 or altogether gone from physical sight and sense, and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_88%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 88 </font></a></p><p></p><p>this not in dreamy sleep. In our day-dreams we can
 recall that for which the poet Tennyson expressed the
 heart's desire,    the touch of a vanished hand,
    And the sound of a voice that is still.
 The mind may even be cognizant of a present flavor and
 odor, when no viand touches the palate and no scent
 salutes the nostrils.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Illusions not ideas</font></p>
 How are veritable ideas to be distinguished from illusions? By learning the origin of each. Ideas are
 emanations from the divine Mind. Thoughts,
 proceeding from the brain or from matter, are
 offshoots of mortal mind; they are mortal material beliefs. Ideas are spiritual, harmonious, and eternal. Beliefs
 proceed from the so-called material senses, which at one
 time are supposed to be substance-matter and at another
 are called spirits.
 <p></p><p>To love one's neighbor as one's self, is a divine idea;
 but this idea can never be seen, felt, nor understood
 through the physical senses. Excite the organ of veneration or religious faith, and the individual manifests
 profound adoration. Excite the opposite development,
 and he blasphemes. These effects, however, do not proceed from Christianity, nor are they spiritual phenomena,
 for both arise from mortal belief.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Trance speaking illusion</font></p>
 Eloquence re-echoes the strains of Truth and Love.
 It is due to inspiration rather than to erudition. It shows
 the possibilities derived from divine Mind,
 though it is said to be a gift whose endowment
 is obtained from books or received from the
 impulsion of departed spirits. When eloquence proceeds
 from the belief that a departed spirit is speaking, who
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_89"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 89</font></a></p><p></p><p>can tell what the unaided medium is incapable of knowing or uttering? This phenomenon only shows that the
 beliefs of mortal mind are loosed. Forgetting her ignorance in the belief that another mind is speaking through
 her, the devotee may become unwontedly eloquent. Having more faith in others than in herself, and believing 
 that somebody else possesses her tongue and mind, she
 talks freely.
 </p><p></p><p>Destroy her belief in outside aid, and her eloquence 
 disappears. The former limits of her belief return. She
 says, " I am incapable of words that glow, for I am uneducated." This familiar instance reaffirms the Scriptural word concerning a man, "As he thinketh in his heart,
 so is he." If one believes that he cannot be an orator without study or a superinduced condition, the body responds
 to this belief, and the tongue grows mute which before
 was eloquent.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific improvisation</font></p>
 Mind is not necessarily dependent upon educational
 processes. It possesses of itself all beauty and poetry,
 and the power of expressing them. Spirit, 
 God, is heard when the senses are silent. We
 are all capable of more than we do. The influence or
 action of Soul confers a freedom, which explains the phenomena of improvisation and the fervor of untutored lips.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine origination </font></p>
 Matter is neither intelligent nor creative. The tree is
 not the author of itself. Sound is not the originator of
 music, and man is not the father of man. Cain
 very naturally concluded that if life was in the
 body, and man gave it, man had the right to take it away.
 This incident shows that the belief of life in matter was 
 "a murderer from the beginning."
 <p></p><p>If seed is necessary to produce wheat, and wheat to
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_90"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 90</font></a></p><p></p><p>produce flour, or if one animal can originate another,
 how then can we account for their primal origin? How
 were the loaves and fishes multiplied on the shores of
 Galilee,--and that, too, without meal or monad from
 which loaf or fish could come?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind is substance</font></p>
 The earth's orbit and the imaginary line called the
 equator are not substance.  The earth's motion and
 position are sustained by Mind alone. Divest
 yourself of the thought that there can be substance in matter, and the movements and transitions now
 possible for mortal mind will be found to be equally
 possible for the body. Then being will be recognized
 as spiritual, and death will be obsolete, though now
 some insist that death is the necessary prelude to
 immortality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal delusions</font></p>
 In dreams we fly to Europe and meet a far-off friend.
 The looker-on sees the body in bed, but the supposed
 inhabitant of that body carries it through
 the air and over the ocean. This shows the
 possibilities of thought. Opium and hashish eaters mentally travel far and work wonders, yet their bodies stay
 in one place. This shows what mortal mentality and
 knowledge are.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific finalities</font></p>
 The admission to one's self that man is God's own likeness sets man free to master the infinite idea. This conviction shuts the door on death, and opens it
 wide towards immortality. The understanding
 and recognition of Spirit must finally come, and we may
 as well improve our time in solving the mysteries of being
 through an apprehension of divine Principle. At present
 we know not what man is, but we certainly shall know
 this when man reflects God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_91"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 91</font></a></p><p></p><p>The Revelator tells us of "a new heaven and a 
 new earth." Have you ever pictured this heaven and
 earth, inhabited by beings under the control of supreme
 wisdom?
 </p><p></p><p>Let us rid ourselves of the belief that man is separated
 from God, and obey only the divine principle, Life and 
 Love. Here is the great point of departure for all true
 spiritual growth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man's genuine being</font></p>
 It is difficult for the sinner to accept divine Science, 
 because Science exposes his nothingness; but the sooner
 error is reduced to its native nothingness, the 
 sooner man's great reality will appear and his 
 genuine being will be understood. The destruction of
 error is by no means the destruction of Truth or Life, but
 is the acknowledgment of them. 
       
 Absorbed in material selfhood we discern and reflect
 but faintly the substance of Life or Mind. The denial of
 material selfhood aids the discernment of man's spiritual and eternal individuality, and destroys the erroneous
 knowledge gained from matter or through what are termed
 the material senses.   
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Erroneous postulates  </font></p>
 Certain erroneous postulates should be here considered
 in order that the spiritual facts may be better
 apprehended.    
      
 The first erroneous postulate of belief is, that substance,
 life, and intelligence are something apart from God.
 <p></p><p>The second erroneous postulate is, that man is both 
 mental and material.
 </p><p></p><p>The third erroneous postulate is, that mind is both evil
 and good; whereas the real Mind cannot be evil nor the
 medium of evil, for Mind is God.
 </p><p></p><p>The fourth erroneous postulate is, that matter is in</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_92%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 92 </font></a></p><p></p><p>telligent, and that man has a material body which is part
 of himself.
 </p><p></p><p>The fifth erroneous postulate is, that matter holds in
 itself the issues of life and death,--that matter is not
 only capable of experiencing pleasure and pain, but also
 capable of imparting these sensations. From the illusion
 implied in this last postulate arises the decomposition of
 mortal bodies in what is termed death.
 </p><p></p><p>Mind is not an entity within the cranium with the power
 of sinning now and forever.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Knowledge of good and evil</font></p>
 In old Scriptural pictures we see a serpent coiled around
 the tree of knowledge and speaking to Adam and Eve.
 This represents the serpent in the act of
 commending to our first parents the knowledge of good and evil, a knowledge gained from matter,
 or evil, instead of from Spirit. The portrayal is still
 graphically accurate, for the common conception of mortal man--a burlesque of God's man--is an outgrowth
 of human knowledge or sensuality, a mere offshoot of
 material sense.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Opposing power</font></p>
 Uncover error, and it turns the lie upon you. Until
 the fact concerning error - namely, its nothingness appears, the moral demand will not be met,
 and the ability to make nothing of error will
 be wanting. We should blush to call that real which is
 only a mistake. The foundation of evil is laid on a belief
 in something besides God. This belief tends to support
 two opposite powers, instead of urging the claims of Truth
 alone. The mistake of thinking that error can be real,
 when it is merely the absence of truth, leads to belief in
 the superiority of error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The age's privilege</font></p>
 Do you say the time has not yet come in which to
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_93"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 93</font></a></p><p></p><p>recognize Soul as substantial and able to control the
 body? Remember Jesus, who nearly nineteen centuries
 ago demonstrated the power of Spirit and said, 
 "He that believeth on me, the works that I  
 do shall he do also," and who also said, "But the hour
 cometh, and now is, when the true worshippers shall 
 worship the Father in spirit and in truth." "Behold,
 now is the accepted time; behold, now is the day of salvation," said Paul. 
      
 </p><p><font size="1">Logic and revelation</font></p>
 Divine logic and revelation coincide. If we believe
 otherwise, we may be sure that either our  
 logic is at fault or that we have misinterpreted 
 revelation. Good never causes evil, nor creates aught
 that can cause evil.
 <p></p><p>Good does not create a mind susceptible of causing 
 evil, for evil is the opposing error and not the truth of
 creation. Destructive electricity is not the offspring of infinite good. Whatever contradicts the real nature of the
 divine Esse, though human faith may clothe it with angelic
 vestments, is without foundation.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Derivatives of spirit</font></p>
 The belief that Spirit is finite as well as infinite has 
 darkened all history. In Christian Science, Spirit, as a
 proper noun, is the name of the Supreme Being. 
 It means quantity and quality, and applies exclusively to God. The modifying derivatives of the word
 spirit refer only to quality, not to God. Man is spiritual.
 He is not God, Spirit. If man were Spirit, then men 
 would be spirits, gods. Finite spirit would be mortal,
 and this is the error embodied in the belief that the infinite can be contained in the finite. This belief tends to 
 becloud our apprehension of the kingdom of heaven and
 of the reign of harmony in the Science of being.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_94"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 94</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific man</font></p>
 Jesus taught but one God, one Spirit, who makes man
 in the image and likeness of Himself,--of Spirit, not of
 matter. Man reflects infinite Truth, Life, and
 Love. The nature of man, thus understood,
 includes all that is implied by the terms "image" and
 "likeness" as used in Scripture. The truly Christian
 and scientific statement of personality and of the relation
 of man to God, with the demonstration which accompanied it, incensed the rabbis, and they said: "Crucify him,
 crucify him . . . by our law he ought to die, because he
 made himself the Son of God."
 <p></p><p>The eastern empires and nations owe their false government to the misconceptions of Deity there prevalent.
 Tyranny, intolerance, and bloodshed, wherever found,
 arise from the belief that the infinite is formed after the
 pattern of mortal personality, passion, and impulse.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ingratitude and denial</font></p>
 The progress of truth confirms its claims, and our
 Master confirmed his words by his works. His healingpower evoked denial, ingratitude, and betrayal, arising from sensuality. Of the ten
 lepers whom Jesus healed, but one returned to give God
 thanks,--that is, to acknowledge the divine Principle
 which had healed him.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual insight</font></p>
 Our Master easily read the thoughts of mankind, and
 this insight better enabled him to direct those thoughts
 aright; but what would be said at this period of an infidel blasphemer who should hint that Jesus used his incisive power injuriously? Our Master read mortal mind
 on a scientific basis, that of the omnipresence of Mind.
 An approximation of this discernment indicates spiritual
 growth and union with the infinite capacities of the one
 Mind. Jesus could injure no one by his Mind-reading.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_95"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 95</font></a></p><p></p><p>The effect of his Mind was always to heal and to save, 
 and this is the only genuine Science of reading mortal
 mind. His holy motives and aims were traduced by the sinners of that period, as they 
 would be to-day if Jesus were personally present. Paul
 said, "To be spiritually minded is life." We approach
 God, or Life, in proportion to our spirituality, our fidelity to Truth and Love; and in that ratio we know all
 human need and are able to discern the thought of the 
 sick and the sinning for the purpose of healing them.
 Error of any kind cannot hide from the law of God.
 </p><p></p><p>Whoever reaches this point of moral culture and goodness cannot injure others, and must do them good. The
 greater or lesser ability of a Christian Scientist to discern
 thought scientifically, depends upon his genuine spirituality. This kind of mind-reading is not clairvoyance,
 but it is important to success in healing, and is one of the
 special characteristics thereof.    
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christ's reappearance   </font></p>
 We welcome the increase of knowledge and the end
 of error, because even human invention must have its
 day, and we want that day to be succeeded 
 by Christian Science, by divine reality. Midnight foretells the dawn. Led by a solitary star amid
 the darkness, the Magi of old foretold the Messiahship 
 of Truth. Is the wise man of to-day believed, when he
 beholds the light which heralds Christ's eternal dawn
 and describes its effulgence?    
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual awakening </font></p>
 Lulled by stupefying illusions, the world is asleep
 in the cradle of infancy, dreaming away the hours.
 Material sense does not unfold the facts of 
 existence; but spiritual sense lifts human 
 consciousness into eternal Truth. Humanity advances
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_96"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 96</font></a></p><p></p><p>slowly out of sinning sense into spiritual understanding;
 unwillingness to learn all things rightly, binds Christendom with chains. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The darkest hours of all</font></p>
 Love will finally mark the hour of harmony, and spiritualization will follow, for Love is Spirit. Before error
 is wholly destroyed, there will be interruptions of the general material routine. Earth
 will become dreary and desolate, but summer and winter,
 seedtime and harvest (though in changed forms), will
 continue unto the end,--until the final spiritualization of
 all things. "The darkest hour precedes the dawn."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Arena of contest</font></p>
 This material world is even now becoming the arena
 for conflicting forces. On one side there will be discord
 and dismay; on the other side there will be
 Science and peace. The breaking up of material beliefs may seem to be famine and pestilence, want
 and woe, sin, sickness, and death, which  assume  new
 phases  until  their  nothingness appears.  These  disturbances will continue until the end of error, when all
 discord will be  swallowed  up in spiritual Truth.
 <p></p><p>Mortal error will vanish in a  moral  chemicalization.
 This  mental  fermentation  has begun, and  will  continue
 until all errors of belief yield to understanding. Belief is
 changeable, but spiritual understanding is changeless.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Millennial glory</font></p>
 As  this  consummation  draws  nearer,  he  who  has
 shaped  his  course  in  accordance  with  divine  Science
 will endure to the end. As material knowledge diminishes and spiritual understanding
 increases,  real  objects will be apprehended mentally
 instead of  materially.
 <p></p><p>During this final conflict, wicked minds  will  endeavor
 to find means by which to accomplish more evil; but
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_97"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 97</font></a></p><p></p><p>those who discern Christian Science will hold crime in
 check. They will aid in the ejection of error. They
 will maintain law and order, and cheerfully await the
 certainty of ultimate perfection.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Dangerous resemblances</font></p>
 In reality, the more closely error simulates truth and
 so-called matter resembles its essence, mortal mind, the
 more impotent error becomes as a belief. According to human belief, the lightning is fierce 
 and the electric current swift, yet in Christian Science 
 the flight of one and the blow of the other will become
 harmless. The more destructive matter becomes, the
 more its nothingness will appear, until matter reaches
 its mortal zenith in illusion and forever disappears. The
 nearer a false belief approaches truth without passing
 the boundary where, having been destroyed by divine 
 Love, it ceases to be even an illusion, the riper it becomes
 for destruction. The more material the belief, the more
 obvious its error, until divine Spirit, supreme in its domain, dominates all matter, and man is found in the likeness of Spirit, his original being.
 <p></p><p>The broadest facts array the most falsities against 
 themselves, for they bring error from under cover. It
 requires courage to utter truth; for the higher Truth
 lifts her voice, the louder will error scream, until its inarticulate sound is forever silenced in oblivion.
 </p><p></p><p>"He uttered His voice, the earth melted." This Scripture indicates that all matter will disappear before the
 supremacy of Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christianity still rejected</font></p>
 Christianity is again demonstrating the Life that is
 Truth, and the Truth that is Life, by the apostolic work of casting out error and healing the 
 sick. Earth has no repayment for the persecutions which
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_98%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98 </font></a></p><p></p><p>attend a new step in Christianity; but the spiritual recompense of the persecuted is assured in the elevation of existence above mortal discord and in the gift of divine Love.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual foreshadowings</font></p>
 The prophet of to-day beholds in the mental horizon
 the signs of these times, the reappearance of the Christianity which heals the sick and destroys error,
 and no other sign shall be given. Body cannot be saved except through Mind. The Science of Christianity is misinterpreted by a material age, for it is the
 healing influence of Spirit (not spirits) which the material
 senses cannot comprehend, which can only be spiritually discerned. Creeds, doctrines, and human hypotheses
 do not express Christian Science; much less can they
 demonstrate it.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Revelation of Science</font></p>
 Beyond the frail premises of human beliefs, above the
 loosening grasp of creeds, the demonstration of Christian
 Mind-healing stands a revealed and practical
 Science. It is imperious throughout all ages
 as Christ's revelation of Truth, of Life, and of Love, which
 remains inviolate for every man to understand and to
 practise.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Science as foreign to all religion</font></p>
 For centuries--yea, always--natural science has not
 been considered a part of any religion, Christianity not
 excepted. Even now multitudes consider that
 which they call science has no proper connection with faith and piety. Mystery does
 not enshroud Christ's teachings, and they are not theoretical and fragmentary, but practical and complete; and
 being practical and complete, they are not deprived of
 their essential vitality.
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Key to the kingdom</font></p>
 The way through which immortality and life are learned
 is not ecclesiastical but Christian, not human but divine,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a></p><p></p><p>not physical but metaphysical, not material but scientifically spiritual. Human philosophy, ethics, and superstition afford no demonstrable divine Principle 
 by which mortals can escape from sin; yet 
 to escape from sin, is what the Bible demands. "Work
 out your own salvation with fear and trembling," says 
 the apostle, and he straightway adds: "for it is God
 which worketh in you both to will and to do of His good
 pleasure" (Philippians ii. 12, 13). Truth has furnished 
 the key to the kingdom, and with this key Christian Science has opened the door of the human understanding.
 None may pick the lock nor enter by some other door. 
 The ordinary teachings are material and not spiritual.
 Christian Science teaches only that which is spiritual and
 divine, and not human. Christian Science is unerring
 and Divine; the human sense of things errs because it
 is human.
 </p><p></p><p>Those individuals, who adopt theosophy, spiritualism, 
 or hypnotism, may possess natures above some others
 who eschew their false beliefs. Therefore my contest is
 not with the individual, but with the false system. I 
 love mankind, and shall continue to labor and to endure.
 </p><p></p><p>The calm, strong currents of true spirituality, the
 manifestations of which are health, purity, and selfimmolation, must deepen human experience, until the
 beliefs of material existence are seen to be a bald imposition, and sin, disease, and death give everlasting place 
 to the scientific demonstration of divine Spirit and to
 God's spiritual, perfect man.
