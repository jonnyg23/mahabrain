 <h1 align="CENTER">Chapter VI - Science, Theology, Medicine</h1>
 <p></p><p><a name="pg_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a></p><p></p><p>But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me
 is not after man. For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught
 it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ.--PAUL.
 </p><p>The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took, and
 hid in three measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.--JESUS.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christian Science discovered</font></p>
 In the year 1866, I discovered the Christ Science or
 divine laws of Life, Truth, and Love, and
 named my discovery Christian Science. God
 had been graciously preparing me during many
 years for the reception of this final revelation of the absolute divine Principle of scientific mental healing.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mission of Christian Science</font></p>
 This apodictical Principle points to the revelation of
 Immanuel, "God with us," - the sovereign ever-presence, delivering the children of men from
 every ill "that flesh is heir to." Through
 Christian Science, religion and medicine are
 inspired with a diviner nature and essence; fresh pinions
 are given to faith and understanding, and thoughts acquaint themselves intelligently with God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Discontent with life</font></p>
 Feeling so perpetually the false consciousness that life
 inheres in the body, yet remembering that in
 reality God is our Life, we may well tremble
 in the prospect of those days in which we must say, "I
 have no pleasure in them."
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p><p></p><p>Whence came to me this heavenly conviction, - a conviction antagonistic to the testimony of the physical senses?
 According to St. Paul, it was "the gift of the grace of
 God given unto me by the effectual working of His power."
 It was the divine law of Life and Love, unfolding to me
 the demonstrable fact that matter possesses neither sensation nor life; that human experiences show the falsity
 of all material things; and that immortal cravings, "the
 price of learning love," establish the truism that the
 only sufferer is mortal mind, for the divine Mind cannot
 suffer.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Demonstrable evidence</font></p>
 My conclusions were reached by allowing the evidence
 of this revelation to multiply with mathematical certainty
 and the lesser demonstration to prove the
 greater, as the product of three multiplied by
 three, equalling nine, proves conclusively that three times
 three duodecillions must be nine duodecillions,--not
 a fraction more, not a unit less.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Light shining in darkness</font></p>
 When apparently near the confines of mortal existence,
 standing already within the shadow of the death-valley,
 I learned these truths in divine Science: that
 all real being is in God, the divine Mind, and
 that Life, Truth, and Love are all-powerful and everpresent; that the opposite of Truth,--called error, sin,
 sickness, disease, death,--is the false testimony of false
 material sense, of mind in matter; that this false sense
 evolves, in belief, a subjective state of mortal mind which
 this same so-called mind names matter thereby shutting
 out the true sense of Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">New lines of thought</font></p>
 My discovery, that erring, mortal, misnamed
 mind produces all the organism and action of
 the mortal body, set my thoughts to work in new channels,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p><p></p><p>and led up to my demonstration of the proposition that
 Mind is All and matter is naught as the leading factor in
 Mind-science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific evidence</font></p>
 Christian Science reveals incontrovertibly that Mind
 is All-in-all, that the only realities are the divine Mind
 and idea. This great fact is not, however, seen
 to be supported by sensible evidence, until its
 divine Principle is demonstrated by healing the sick and
 thus proved absolute and divine. This proof once seen,
 no other conclusion can be reached.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Solitary research</font></p>
 For three years after my discovery, I sought the solution of this problem of Mind-healing, searched the Scriptures and read little else, kept aloof from society, and devoted time and energies to discovering a positive rule. The search was sweet, calm, and
 buoyant with hope, not selfish nor depressing. I knew
 the Principle of all harmonious Mind-action to be God,
 and that cures were produced in primitive Christian
 healing by holy, uplifting faith; but I must know the
 Science of this healing, and I won my way to absolute
 conclusions through divine revelation, reason, and demonstration. The revelation of Truth in the understanding came to me gradually and apparently through divine
 power. When a new spiritual idea is borne to earth, the
 prophetic Scripture of Isaiah is renewedly fulfilled:
 "Unto us a child is born, . . . and his name shall be
 called Wonderful."
 <p></p><p>Jesus once said of his lessons: "My doctrine is not
 mine, but His that sent me. If any man will do His will,
 he shall know of the doctrine, whether it be of God, or
 whether I speak of myself." (John vii. 16, 17.)
 </p><p></p><p>God's allness learned
 The three great verities of Spirit, omnipotence, omni</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_110"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 110</font></a></p><p></p><p>presence, omniscience,--Spirit possessing all power,
 filling all space, constituting all Science,--contradict
 forever the belief that matter can be actual.
 These eternal verities reveal primeval existence as the radiant reality of God's creation,
 in which all that He has made is pronounced by His wisdom good.
 </p><p></p><p>Thus it was that I beheld, as never before, the awful
 unreality called evil. The equipollence of God brought
 to light another glorious proposition, - man's perfectibility and the establishment of the kingdom of heaven on
 earth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scriptural foundations</font></p>
 In following these leadings of scientific revelation,
 the Bible was my only textbook. The Scriptures were
 illumined; reason and revelation were reconciled, and afterwards the truth of Christian
 Science was demonstrated. No human pen nor tongue
 taught me the Science contained in this book, SCIENCE
 AND HEALTH; and neither tongue nor pen can overthrow it. This book may be distorted by shallow criticism or by careless or malicious students, and its ideas
 may be temporarily abused and misrepresented; but the
 Science and truth therein will forever remain to be discerned and demonstrated.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The demonstration lost and found</font></p>
 Jesus demonstrated the power of Christian Science to
 heal mortal minds and bodies. But this power was lost
 sight of, and must again be spiritually discerned, taught, and demonstrated according
 to Christ's command, with "signs following."
 Its Science must be apprehended by as many as believe
 on Christ and spiritually understand Truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mystical antagonists</font></p>
 No analogy exists between the vague hypotheses of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a></p><p></p><p>agnosticism, pantheism, theosophy, spiritualism, or
 millenarianism and the demonstrable truths of Christian Science; and I find the will, or sensuous
 reason of the human mind, to be opposed to
 the divine Mind as expressed through divine Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Optical illustration of Science</font></p>
 Christian Science is natural, but not physical. The
 Science of God and man is no more supernatural than
 is the science of numbers, though departing
 from the realm of the physical, as the Science
 of God, Spirit, must, some may deny its right to
 the name of Science. The Principle of divine metaphysics
 is God; the practice of divine metaphysics is the utilization of the power of Truth over error; its rules demonstrate its Science. Divine metaphysics reverses perverted
 and physical hypotheses as to Deity, even as the explanation of optics rejects the incidental or inverted
 image and shows what this inverted image is meant to
 represent.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Pertinent proposal</font></p>
 A prize of one hundred pounds, offered in Oxford University, England, for the best essay on Natural Science,
 - an essay calculated to offset the tendency of
 the age to attribute physical effects to physical
 causes rather than to a final spiritual cause,--is one of
 many incidents which show that Christian Science meets
 a yearning of the human race for spirituality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Confirmatory tests</font></p>
 After a lengthy examination of my discovery and its
 demonstration in healing the sick, this fact became evident to me,--that Mind governs the body,
 not partially but wholly.  I submitted my
 metaphysical system of treating disease to the broadest practical tests. Since then this system has gradually
 gained ground, and has proved itself, whenever scien<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a></p><p></p><p>tifically employed, to be the most effective curative agent
 in medical practice.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">One school of Truth</font></p>
 Is there more than one school of Christian Science?
 Christian Science is demonstrable. There can, therefore, be but one method in its teaching. Those who depart from this method forfeit their claims to
 belong to its school, and they become adherents of the Socratic, the Platonic, the Spencerian, or some
 other school. By this is meant that they adopt and adhere to some particular system of human opinions.  Although these opinions may have occasional gleams of
 divinity, borrowed from that truly divine Science which
 eschews man-made systems, they nevertheless remain
 wholly human in their origin and tendency and are not
 scientifically Christian.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unchanging Principle</font></p>
 From the infinite One in Christian Science comes one
 Principle and its infinite idea, and with this infinitude
 come spiritual rules, laws, and their demonstration, which, like the great Giver, are "the
 same yesterday, and to-day, and forever;" for thus are
 the divine Principle of healing and the Christ-idea characterized in the epistle to the Hebrews.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">On sandy foundations</font></p>
 Any theory of Christian Science, which departs from
 what has already been stated and proved to be true, affords no foundation upon which to establish
 a genuine school of this Science. Also, if any
 so-called new school claims to be Christian Science, and
 yet uses another author's discoveries without giving that
 author proper credit, such a school is erroneous, for it
 inculcates a breach of that divine commandment in the
 Hebrew Decalogue, "Thou shalt not steal."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Principle and practice</font></p>
 God is the Principle of divine metaphysics. As there
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a></p><p></p><p>is but one God, there can be but one divine Principle of
 all Science; and there must be fixed rules for the demonstration of this divine Principle. The letter
 of Science plentifully reaches humanity to-day,
 but its spirit comes only in small degrees. The vital part,
 the heart and soul of Christian Science, is Love. Without this, the letter is but the dead body of Science, pulseless, cold, inanimate.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reversible propositions</font></p>
 The fundamental propositions of divine metaphysics
 are summarized in the four following, to me, self-evident
 propositions. Even if reversed, these propositions will be found to agree in statement and
 proof, showing mathematically their exact relation to
 Truth. De Quincey says mathematics has not a foot to
 stand upon which is not purely metaphysical.
 <p></p><p>  1. God is All-in-all.<br>
   2. God is good. Good is Mind.<br>
   3. God, Spirit, being all, nothing is matter.<br>
   4. Life, God, omnipotent good, deny death, evil, sin,
 disease. - Disease, sin, evil, death, deny good, omnipotent God, Life.<br>
 </p><p></p><p>Which of the denials in proposition four is true? Both
 are not, cannot be, true. According to the Scripture,
 I find that God is true, "but every [mortal] man a
 liar."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Metaphysical inversions</font></p>
 The divine metaphysics of Christian Science, like the
 method in mathematics, proves the rule by inversion.
 For example: There is no pain in Truth, and
 no truth in pain; no nerve in Mind, and no
 mind in nerve; no matter in Mind, and no mind in matter; no matter in Life, and no life in matter; no matter
 in good, and no good in matter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Definition of mortal mind</font></p>
 Usage classes both evil and good together as mind;
 therefore, to be understood, the author calls sick and sinful humanity mortal mind,--meaning by this
 term the flesh opposed to Spirit, the human
 mind and evil in contradistinction to the divine Mind, or
 Truth and good. The spiritually unscientific definition
 of mind is based on the evidence of the physical senses,
 which makes minds many and calls mind both human and
 divine.
 <p></p><p>In Science, Mind is one, including noumenon and phenomena, God and His thoughts.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Imperfect terminology</font></p>
 Mortal mind is a solecism in language, and involves an
 improper use of the word mind. As Mind is immortal,
 the phrase mortal mind implies something untrue and therefore unreal; and as the phrase
 is used in teaching Christian Science, it is meant to
 designate that which has no real existence.  Indeed, if
 a better word or phrase could be suggested, it would
 be used; but in expressing the new tongue we must
 sometimes recur to the old and imperfect, and the new
 wine of the Spirit has to be poured into the old bottles of
 the letter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Causation mental</font></p>
 Christian Science explains all cause and effect as mental, not physical. It lifts the veil of mystery from Soul and
 body. It shows the scientific relation of man
 to God, disentangles the interlaced ambiguities
 of being, and sets free the imprisoned thought. In divine
 Science, the universe, including man, is spiritual, harmonious, and eternal. Science shows that what is termed matter is but the subjective state of what is termed by the
 author mortal mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Philological inadequacy</font></p>
 Apart from the usual opposition to everything new,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a></p><p></p><p>the one great obstacle to the reception of that spirituality, through which the understanding of Mind-science
 comes, is the inadequacy of material terms for
 metaphysical statements, and the consequent
 difficulty of so expressing metaphysical ideas as to make
 them comprehensible to any reader, who has not personally demonstrated Christian Science as brought forth in
 my discovery. Job says: "The ear trieth words, as the
 mouth tasteth meat." The great difficulty is to give the
 right impression, when translating material terms back
 into the original spiritual tongue.
 </p><p></p><p>SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATION OF IMMORTAL MIND
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine synonyms</font></p>
 GOD: Divine Principle, Life, Truth, Love,
 Soul, Spirit, Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine image</font></p>
 MAN: God's spiritual idea, individual, perfect, eternal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine reflection</font></p>
 IDEA: An image in Mind; the immediate
 object of understanding.--Webster.
 <p>SCIENTIFIC TRANSLATION OF MORTAL MIND
 </p><p>First Degree: Depravity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unreality</font></p>
 PHYSICAL. Evil beliefs, passions and appetites, fear,
 depraved will, self-justification, pride, envy, deceit, hatred, revenge, sin, sickness, disease,
 death.
 <p>Second Degree: Evil beliefs disappearing.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Transitional qualities</font></p>
 MORAL. Humanity, honesty, affection, compassion, hope, faith, meekness, temperance.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a></p><p></p><p>Third Degree: Understanding.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reality</font></p>
 SPIRITUAL. Wisdom, purity, spiritual understanding,
 spiritual power, love, health, holiness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual universe</font></p>
 In the third degree mortal mind disappears, and man as
 God's image appears. Science so reverses the evidence
 before the corporeal human senses, as to make
 this Scriptural testimony true in our hearts,
 "The last shall be first, and the first last," so that God
 and His idea may be to us what divinity really is and
 must of necessity be,--all-inclusive.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Aim of Science</font></p>
 A correct view of Christian Science and of its adaptation to healing includes vastly more than is at first seen.
 Works on metaphysics leave the grand point
 untouched. They never crown the power of
 Mind as the Messiah, nor do they carry the day against
 physical enemies,--even to the extinction of all belief in
 matter, evil, disease, and death,--nor insist upon the fact
 that God is all, therefore that matter is nothing beyond an
 image in mortal mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine personality</font></p>
 Christian Science strongly emphasizes the thought that
 God is not corporeal, but incorporeal,--that is,
 bodiless. Mortals are corporeal, but God is
 incorporeal.
 <p></p><p>As the words person and personal are commonly and
 ignorantly employed, they often lead, when applied to
 Deity, to confused and erroneous conceptions of divinity
 and its distinction from humanity. If the term personality,
 as applied to God, means infinite personality, then God is
 infinite Person,--in the sense of infinite personality, but
 not in the lower sense. An infinite Mind in a finite form
 is an absolute impossibility.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a></p><p></p><p>The term individuality is also open to objections, because an individual may be one of a series, one of many,
 as an individual man, an individual horse; whereas God
 is One,--not one of a series, but one alone and without
 an equal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual language</font></p>
 God is Spirit; therefore the language of Spirit must
 be, and is, spiritual. Christian Science attaches no physical nature and significance to the Supreme
 Being or His manifestation; mortals alone do
 this. God's essential language is spoken of in the last
 chapter of Mark's Gospel as the new tongue, the spiritual meaning of which is attained through "signs
 following."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The miracles of Jesus</font></p>
 Ear hath not heard, nor hath lip spoken, the pure language of Spirit. Our Master taught spirituality by similitudes and parables. As a divine student he
 unfolded God to man, illustrating and demonstrating Life and Truth in himself and by his power over
 the sick and sinning. Human theories are inadequate to
 interpret the divine Principle involved in the miracles
 (marvels) wrought by Jesus and especially in his mighty,
 crowning, unparalleled, and triumphant exit from the
 flesh.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Opacity of the senses</font></p>
 Evidence drawn from the five physical senses relates
 solely to human reason; and because of opacity to the true light, human reason dimly reflects and feebly transmits Jesus' works and words. Truth
 is a revelation.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Leaven of Truth</font></p>
 Jesus bade his disciples beware of the leaven of the
 Pharisees and of the Sadducees, which he defined as human doctrines. His parable of the
 "leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a></p><p></p><p>of meal, till the whole was leavened," impels the inference that the spiritual leaven signifies the Science of Christ
 and its spiritual interpretation,--an inference far above
 the merely ecclesiastical and formal applications of the
 illustration.
 </p><p></p><p>Did not this parable point a moral with a prophecy,
 foretelling the second appearing in the flesh of the
 Christ, Truth, hidden in sacred secrecy from the visible world?
 </p><p></p><p>Ages pass, but this leaven of Truth is ever at work. It
 must destroy the entire mass of error, and so be eternally
 glorified in man's spiritual freedom.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The divine and human contrasted</font></p>
 In their spiritual significance, Science, Theology, and
 Medicine are means of divine thought, which include spiritual laws emanating from the invisible and infinite power and grace. The parable may
 import that these spiritual laws, perverted by
 a perverse material sense of law, are metaphysically presented as three measures of meal,--that is, three modes
 of mortal thought. In all mortal forms of thought, dust
 is dignified as the natural status of men and things, and
 modes of material motion are honored with the name of
 laws. This continues until the leaven of Spirit changes
 the whole of mortal thought, as yeast changes the chemical
 properties of meal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Certain contradictions</font></p>
 The definitions of material law, as given by natural
 science, represent a kingdom necessarily divided against
 itself, because these definitions portray law as
 physical, not spiritual. Therefore they contradict the divine decrees and violate the law of Love, in
 which nature and God are one and the natural order of
 heaven comes down to earth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 119</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unescapable dilemma</font></p>
 When we endow matter with vague spiritual power,
 that is, when we do so in our theories, for of course we
 cannot really endow matter with what it does
 not and cannot possess, - we disown the Almighty, for such theories lead to one of two things. They
 either presuppose the self-evolution and self-government 
 of matter, or else they assume that matter is the product
 of Spirit. To seize the first horn of this dilemma and consider matter as a power in and of itself, is to leave the creator out of His own universe; while to grasp the other
 horn of the dilemma and regard God as the creator of
 matter, is not only to make Him responsible for all disasters, physical and moral, but to announce Him as their
 source, thereby making Him guilty of maintaining perpetual misrule in the form and under the name of natural
 law.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God and nature</font></p>
 In one sense God is identical with nature, but this nature is spiritual and is not expressed in matter. The lawgiver, whose lightning palsies or prostrates in 
 death the child at prayer, is not the divine ideal
 of omnipresent Love. God is natural good, and is represented only by the idea of goodness; while evil should be
 regarded as unnatural, because it is opposed to the nature
 of Spirit, God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The sun and Soul</font></p>
 In viewing the sunrise, one finds that it contradicts
 the evidence before the senses to believe that the earth
 is in motion and the sun at rest. As astronomy reverses the human perception of the
 movement of the solar system, so Christian Science reverses the seeming relation of Soul and body and makes
 body tributary to Mind. Thus it is with man, who
 is but the humble servant of the restful Mind, though it
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a></p><p></p><p>seems otherwise to finite sense. But we shall never understand this while we admit that soul is in body or mind in
 matter, and that man is included in non-intelligence.
 Soul, or Spirit, is God, unchangeable and eternal; and
 man coexists with and reflects Soul, God, for man is God's
 image.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reversal of testimony</font></p>
 Science reverses the false testimony of the physical
 senses, and by this reversal mortals arrive at the fundamental facts of being. Then the question inevitably arises: Is a man sick if the material
 senses indicate that he is in good health? No! for matter
 can make no conditions for man. And is he well if the
 senses say he is sick? Yes, he is well in Science in which
 health is normal and disease is abnormal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Health and the senses</font></p>
 Health is not a condition of matter, but of Mind; nor
 can the material senses bear reliable testimony on the subject of health. The Science of Mind-healing
 shows it to be impossible for aught but Mind
 to testify truly or to exhibit the real status of man. Therefore the divine Principle of Science, reversing the testimony of the physical senses, reveals man as harmoniously
 existent in Truth, which is the only basis of health; and
 thus Science denies all disease, heals the sick, overthrows
 false evidence, and refutes materialistic logic.
 <p></p><p>Any conclusion pro or con, deduced from supposed sensation in matter or from matter's supposed consciousness
 of health or disease, instead of reversing the testimony of
 the physical senses, confirms that testimony as legitimate
 and so leads to disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Historic illustrations</font></p>
 When Columbus gave freer breath to the
 globe, ignorance and superstition chained the
 limbs of the brave old navigator, and disgrace and star<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a></p><p></p><p>vation stared him in the face; but sterner still would have

 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Perennial beauty</font></p>
 The Chaldean Wisemen read in the stars the fate of
 empires and the fortunes of men. Though no higher
 revelation than the horoscope was to them displayed upon the empyrean, earth and heaven
 were bright, and bird and blossom were glad in God's
 perennial and happy sunshine, golden with Truth. So
 we have goodness and beauty to gladden the heart; but
 man, left to the hypotheses of material sense unexplained
 by Science, is as the wandering comet or the desolate
 star--"a weary searcher for a viewless home."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Astronomic unfoldings</font></p>
 The earth's diurnal rotation is invisible to the physical
 eye, and the sun seems to move from east to west, instead
 of the earth from west to east. Until rebuked
 by clearer views of the everlasting facts, this 
 false testimony of the eye deluded the judgment and induced false conclusions. Science shows appearances often
 to be erroneous, and corrects these errors by the simple
 rule that the greater controls the lesser. The sun is the
 central stillness, so far as our solar system is concerned,
 and the earth revolves about the sun once a year, besides
 turning daily on its own axis.
 <p></p><p>As thus indicated, astronomical order imitates the
 action of divine Principle; and the universe, the reflection of God, is thus brought nearer the spiritual fact, and
 is allied to divine Science as displayed in the everlasting
 government of the universe.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_122"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 122</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Opposing testimony</font></p>
 The evidence of the physical senses often reverses the
 real Science of being, and so creates a reign of discord, assigning seeming power to sin, sickness, and
 death; but the great facts of Life, rightly understood, defeat this triad of errors, contradict their false
 witnesses, and reveal the kingdom of heaven,--the actual
 reign of harmony on earth. The material senses' reversal of the Science of Soul was practically exposed nineteen hundred years ago by the demonstrations of Jesus;
 yet these so-called senses still make mortal mind tributary
 to mortal body, and ordain certain sections of matter, such
 as brain and nerves, as the seats of pain and pleasure,
 from which matter reports to this so-called mind its status
 of happiness or misery.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Testimony of the senses</font></p>
 The optical focus is another proof of the illusion of
 material sense. On the eye's retina, sky and tree-tops
 apparently join hands, clouds and ocean meet
 and mingle. The barometer,--that little
 prophet of storm and sunshine, denying the testimony of
 the senses,--points to fair weather in the midst of murky
 clouds and drenching rain. Experience is full of instances
 of similar illusions, which every thinker can recall for
 himself.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual sense of life</font></p>
 To material sense, the severance of the jugular vein
 takes away life; but to spiritual sense and
 in Science, Life goes on unchanged and
 being is eternal. Temporal life is a false sense of
 existence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ptolemaic and psychical error</font></p>
 Our theories make the same mistake regarding Soul
 and body that Ptolemy made regarding the solar system.
 They insist that soul is in body and mind therefore tributary to matter. Astronomical science has destroyed the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_123"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 123</font></a></p><p></p><p>false theory as to the relations of the celestial bodies, and
 Christian Science will surely destroy the greater error as
 to our terrestrial bodies. The true idea and
 Principle of man will then appear. The Ptolemaic blunder could not affect the harmony of
 being as does the error relating to soul and body, which
 reverses the order of Science and assigns to matter the
 power and prerogative of Spirit, so that man becomes
 the most absolutely weak and inharmonious creature in
 the universe.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Seeming and being</font></p>
 The verity of Mind shows conclusively how it is that
 matter seems to be, but is not. Divine Science,
 rising above physical theories, excludes matter,
 resolves things into thoughts, and replaces the objects of
 material sense with spiritual ideas.
 <p></p><p>The term CHRISTIAN SCIENCE was introduced by
 the author to designate the scientific system of divine
 healing.
 </p><p></p><p>The revelation consists of two parts:
 </p><p></p><p>1. The discovery of this divine Science of Mindhealing, through a spiritual sense of the Scriptures and
 through the teachings of the Comforter, as promised by
 the Master.
 </p><p></p><p>2. The proof, by present demonstration, that the socalled miracles of Jesus did not specially belong to a
 dispensation now ended, but that they illustrated an
 ever-operative divine Principle. The operation of this
 Principle indicates the eternality of the scientific order
 and continuity of being.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific basis</font></p>
 Christian Science differs from material science, but not on that account is it less scientific. On the contrary, Christian Science is pre-emi<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_124"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 124</font></a></p><p></p><p>mently scientific, being based on Truth, the Principle of
 all science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Physical science a blind belief</font></p>
 Physical science (so-called) is human knowledge,--a
 law of mortal mind, a blind belief, a Samson shorn of his
 strength. When this human belief lacks organizations to support it, its foundations are gone.
 Having neither moral might, spiritual basis,
 nor holy Principle of its own, this belief mistakes effect
 for cause and seeks to find life and intelligence in matter,
 thus limiting Life and holding fast to discord and death.
 In a word, human belief is a blind conclusion from material
 reasoning. This is a mortal, finite sense of things, which
 immortal Spirit silences forever.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Right interpretation</font></p>
 The universe, like man, is to be interpreted by Science
 from its divine Principle, God, and then it can be understood; but when explained on the basis of
 physical sense and represented  as subject to
 growth, maturity, and decay, the universe, like man, is,
 and must continue to be, an enigma.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">All force mental</font></p>
 Adhesion, cohesion, and  attraction are properties of
 Mind. They belong to divine Principle,   and  support
 the equipoise of that thought-force, which
 launched the earth in its orbit and said to the
 proud wave, "Thus far and no farther."
 <p></p><p>Spirit is the life, substance, and continuity of all
 things. We tread on forces.  Withdraw them, and
 creation must collapse. Human knowledge calls them
 forces of matter; but divine Science declares that they
 belong wholly to divine Mind, are inherent in this
 Mind, and so restores them to their rightful home and
 classification.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Corporeal changes</font></p>
 The elements and functions of the physical body and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_125"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 125</font></a></p><p></p><p>of the physical world will change as mortal mind changes
 its beliefs. What is now considered the best condition
 for organic and functional health in the human
 body may no longer be found indispensable
 to health. Moral conditions will be found always harmonious and health-giving. Neither organic inaction
 nor overaction is beyond God's control; and man will
 be found normal and natural to changed mortal thought,
 and therefore more harmonious in his manifestations than
 he was in the prior states which human belief created and
 sanctioned.
 </p><p></p><p>As human thought changes from one stage to another of conscious pain and painlessness, sorrow and
 joy, - from fear to hope and from faith to understanding, - the visible manifestation will at last be man governed by Soul, not by material sense. Reflecting God's
 government, man is self-governed. When subordinate
 to the divine Spirit, man cannot be controlled by sin or
 death, thus proving our material theories about laws of
 health to be valueless.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The time and tide</font></p>
 The seasons will come and go with changes of time and
 tide, cold and heat, latitude and longitude. The agriculturist will find that these changes cannot
 affect his crops. "As a vesture shalt Thou
 change them and they shall be changed." The mariner
 will have dominion over the atmosphere and the great
 deep, over the fish of the sea and the fowls of the air.
 The astronomer will no longer look up to the stars, he will look out from them upon the universe; and the
 florist will find his flower before its seed.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal nothingness</font></p>
 Thus matter will finally be proved nothing more
 than a mortal belief, wholly inadequate to affect a man
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_126"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 126</font></a></p><p></p><p>through its supposed organic action or supposed existence. Error will be no longer used in stating truth. The
 problem of nothingness, or "dust to dust," will
 be solved, and mortal mind will be without
 form and void, for mortality will cease when man beholds
 himself God's reflection, even as man sees his reflection
 in a glass.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A lack of originality</font></p>
 All Science is divine. Human thought never projected the least portion of true being. Human belief
 has sought and interpreted in its own way
 the echo of Spirit, and so seems to have
 reversed it and repeated it materially; but the human
 mind never produced a real tone nor sent forth a positive
 sound.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Antagonistic questions</font></p>
 The point at issue between Christian Science on the
 one hand and popular theology on the other is this: Shall
 Science explain cause and effect as being
 both natural and spiritual? Or shall all that
 is beyond the cognizance of the material senses be called
 supernatural, and be left to the mercy of speculative
 hypotheses?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Biblical basis</font></p>
 I have set forth Christian Science and its application
 to the treatment of disease just as I have discovered them.
 I have demonstrated through Mind the effects
 of Truth on the health, longevity, and morals
 of men; and I have found nothing in ancient or in modern
 systems on which to found my own, except the teachings
 and demonstrations of our great Master and the lives of
 prophets and apostles. The Bible has been my only authority. I have had no other guide in "the straight and
 narrow way" of Truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Science and Christianity</font></p>
 If Christendom resists the author's application of the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_127"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 127</font></a></p><p></p><p>word Science to Christianity, or questions her use of the
 word Science, she will not therefore lose faith in Christianity, nor will Christianity lose its hold upon
 her. If God, the All-in-all, be the creator of
 the spiritual universe, including man, then everything
 entitled to a classification as truth, or Science, must be
 comprised in a knowledge or understanding of God, for
 there can be nothing beyond illimitable divinity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific terms</font></p>
 The terms Divine Science, Spiritual Science, Christ
 Science or Christian Science, or Science alone, she employs interchangeably, according to the requirements of the context. These synonymous terms stand for everything relating to God, the infinite, supreme, eternal Mind. It may be said, however,
 that the term Christian Science relates especially to
 Science as applied to humanity. Christian Science reveals God, not as the author of sin, sickness, and death,
 but as divine Principle, Supreme Being, Mind, exempt
 from all evil. It teaches that matter is the falsity, not
 the fact, of existence; that nerves, brain, stomach, lungs,
 and so forth, have--as matter--no intelligence, life, nor
 sensation.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No physical science</font></p>
 There is no physical science, inasmuch as all truth
 proceeds from the divine Mind. Therefore truth is not
 human, and is not a law of matter, for matter
 is not a lawgiver. Science is an emanation of
 divine Mind, and is alone able to interpret God aright.
 It has a spiritual, and not a material origin. It is a divine
 utterance,--the Comforter which leadeth into all truth.
 <p></p><p>Christian Science eschews what is called natural science,
 in so far as this is built on the false hypotheses that matter
 is its own lawgiver, that law is founded on material con</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_128"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 128</font></a></p><p></p><p>ditions, and that these are final and overrule the might of
 divine Mind. Good is natural and primitive. It is not
 miraculous to itself.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Practical Science</font></p>
 The term Science, properly understood, refers only to
 the laws of God and to His government of the universe,
 inclusive of man. From this it follows that
 business men and cultured scholars have found
 that Christian Science enhances their endurance and
 mental powers, enlarges their perception of character,
 gives them acuteness and comprehensiveness and an
 ability to exceed their ordinary capacity. The human
 mind, imbued with this spiritual understanding, becomes
 more elastic, is capable of greater endurance, escapes
 somewhat from itself, and requires less repose. A knowledge of the Science of being develops the latent abilities
 and possibilities of man. It extends the atmosphere of
 thought, giving mortals access to broader and higher
 realms. It raises the thinker into his native air of insight
 and perspicacity.
 <p></p><p>An odor becomes beneficent and agreeable only in proportion to its escape into the surrounding atmosphere.
 So it is with our knowledge of Truth. If one would
 not quarrel with his fellow-man for waking him from
 a cataleptic nightmare, he should not resist Truth, which
 banishes - yea, forever destroys with the higher testimony of Spirit--the so-called evidence of matter.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mathematics and scientific logic</font></p>
 Science relates to Mind, not matter. It rests on fixed
 Principle and not upon the judgment of false sensation.
 The addition of two sums in mathematics must
 always bring the same result. So is it with
 logic. If both the major and the minor propositions of a syllogism are correct, the conclusion, if properly
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_129"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 129</font></a></p><p></p><p>drawn, cannot be false. So in Christian Science there
 are no discords nor contradictions, because its logic is as
 harmonious as the reasoning of an accurately stated syllogism or of a properly computed sum in arithmetic.
 Truth is ever truthful, and can tolerate no error in
 premise or conclusion.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth by inversion</font></p>
 If you wish to know the spiritual fact, you can discover it by reversing the material fable, be the
 fable pro or con,--be it in accord with your
 preconceptions or utterly contrary to them.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Antagonistic theories</font></p>
 Pantheism may be defined as a belief in the intelligence of matter,--a belief which Science overthrows.
 In those days there will be "great tribulation
 such as was not since the beginning of the
 world;" and earth will echo the cry, "Art thou [Truth]
 come hither to torment us before the time?" Animal
 magnetism, hypnotism, spiritualism, theosophy, agnosticism, pantheism, and infidelity are antagonistic to true
 being and fatal to its demonstration; and so are some
 other systems.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ontology needed</font></p>
 We must abandon pharmaceutics, and take up ontology,--"the science of real being." We must look deep
 into realism instead of accepting only the outward sense of things. Can we gather peaches
 from a pine-tree, or learn from discord the concord of
 being? Yet quite as rational are some of the leading
 illusions along the path which Science must tread in its
 reformatory mission among mortals. The very name,
 illusion, points to nothingness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reluctant guests</font></p>
 The generous liver may object to the author's small
 estimate of the pleasures of the table. The sinner sees,
 in the system taught in this book, that the demands of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_130"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 130</font></a></p><p></p><p>God must be met. The petty intellect is alarmed by constant appeals to Mind. The licentious disposition is discouraged over its slight spiritual prospects.
 When all men are bidden to the feast, the excuses come. One has a farm, another has merchandise,
 and therefore they cannot accept.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Excuses for ignorance</font></p>
 It is vain to speak dishonestly of divine Science, which
 destroys all discord, when you can demonstrate
 the actuality of Science. It is unwise to doubt
 if reality is in perfect harmony with God, divine Principle,
 - if Science, when understood and demonstrated, will
 destroy all discord, - since you admit that God is omnipotent; for from this premise it follows that good and
 its sweet concords have all-power.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Children and adults</font></p>
 Christian Science, properly understood, would disabuse the human mind of material beliefs which war
 against spiritual facts; and these material
 beliefs must be denied and cast out to make
 place for truth. You cannot add to the contents of a
 vessel already full. Laboring long to shake the adult's
 faith in matter and to inculcate a grain of faith in God, an inkling of the ability of Spirit to make the body harmonious,--the author has often remembered our Master's
 love for little children, and understood how truly such as
 they belong to the heavenly kingdom.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">All evil unnatural</font></p>
 If thought is startled at the strong claim of Science
 for the supremacy of God, or Truth, and doubts the supremacy of good, ought we not, contrariwise, to be astounded at the vigorous claims
 of evil and doubt them, and no longer think it natural to
 love sin and unnatural to forsake it,--no longer imagine
 evil to be ever-present and good absent?  Truth  should
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_131"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 131</font></a></p><p></p><p>not seem so surprising and unnatural as error, and error
 should not seem so real as truth. Sickness should not seem
 so real as health. There is no error in Science, and our
 lives must be governed by reality in order to be in harmony with God, the divine Principle of all being.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The error of carnality</font></p>
 When once destroyed by divine Science, the false evidence before the corporeal senses disappears. Hence the
 opposition of sensuous man to the Science of
 Soul and the significance of the Scripture, "The
 carnal mind is enmity against God." The central fact of
 the Bible is the superiority of spiritual over physical power.
 <p></p><p></p><center>THEOLOGY</center>
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Churchly neglect</font></p>
 Must Christian Science come through the Christian
 churches as some persons insist? This Science has come
 already, after the manner of God's appointing, but the churches seem not ready to receive it, according to the Scriptural saying, "He came
 unto his own, and his own received him not." Jesus once
 said: "I thank Thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and
 earth, that Thou hast hid these things from the wise
 and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes: even
 so, Father, for so it seemed good in Thy sight." As aforetime, the spirit of the Christ, which taketh away the ceremonies and doctrines of men, is not accepted until the
 hearts of men are made ready for it.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">John the Baptist, and the Messiah</font></p>
 The mission of Jesus confirmed prophecy, and explained the so-called miracles of olden time as natural
 demonstrations of the divine power, demonstra- ,
 tions which were not understood. Jesus' works
 established his claim to the Messiahship. In
 reply to John's inquiry, "Art thou he that should come,"
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_132"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 132</font></a></p><p></p><p>Jesus returned an affirmative reply, recounting his works
 instead of referring to his doctrine, confident that this
 exhibition of the divine power to heal would fully answer the question. Hence his reply: "Go and show
 John again those things which ye do hear and see: the
 blind receive their sight and the lame walk, the lepers
 are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up,
 and the poor have the gospel preached to them. And
 blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me." In
 other words, he gave his benediction to any one who
 should not deny that such effects, coming from divine
 Mind, prove the unity of God,--the divine principle
 which brings out all harmony.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christ rejected</font></p>
 The Pharisees of old thrust the spiritual idea and the
 man who lived it out of their synagogues, and retained
 their materialistic beliefs about God. Jesus'
 system of healing received no aid nor approval
 from other sanitary or religious systems, from doctrines
 of physics or of divinity; and it has not yet been generally accepted. To-day, as of yore, unconscious of the
 reappearing of the spiritual idea, blind belief shuts the
 door upon it, and condemns the cure of the sick and sinning if it is wrought on any but a material and a doctrinal
 theory. Anticipating this rejection of idealism, of the
 true idea of God, - this salvation from all error, physical and mental,--Jesus asked, "When the Son of man
 cometh, shall he find faith on the earth?"
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">John's misgivings</font></p>
 Did the doctrines of John the Baptist confer healing
 power upon him, or endow him with the truest conception of the Christ? This righteous preacher
 once pointed his disciples to Jesus as "the
 Lamb of God;" yet afterwards he seriously questioned
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_133"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 133</font></a></p><p></p><p>the signs of the Messianic appearing, and sent the inquiry
 to Jesus, "Art thou he that should come?"
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Faith according to works</font></p>
 Was John's faith greater than that of the Samaritan
 woman, who said, "Is not this the Christ?"
 There was also a certain centurion of whose
 faith Jesus himself declared, "I have not found so great
 faith, no, not in Israel."
 <p></p><p>In Egypt, it was Mind which saved the Israelites from
 belief in the plagues. In the wilderness, streams flowed
 from the rock, and manna fell from the sky. The Israelites
 looked upon the brazen serpent, and straightway believed
 that they were healed of the poisonous stings of vipers.
 In national prosperity, miracles attended the successes of
 the Hebrews; but when they departed from the true
 idea, their demoralization began. Even in captivity
 among foreign nations, the divine Principle wrought
 wonders for the people of God in the fiery furnace and
 in kings' palaces.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Judaism antipathetic</font></p>
 Judaism was the antithesis of Christianity, because
 Judaism engendered the limited form of a national or
 tribal religion. It was a finite and material
 system, carried out in special theories concerning God, man, sanitary methods, and a religious cultus.
 That he made "himself equal with God," was one of the
 Jewish accusations against him who planted Christianity
 on the foundation of Spirit, who taught as he was inspired by the Father and would recognize no life, intelligence, nor substance outside of God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Priestly learning</font></p>
 The Jewish conception of God, as Yawah, Jehovah,
 or only a mighty hero and king, has not quite
 given place to the true knowledge of God.
 Creeds and rituals have not cleansed their hands  of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_134"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 134</font></a></p><p></p><p>rabbinical lore. To-day the cry of bygone ages is repeated, "Crucify him!"   At every advancing step, truth
 is still opposed with sword  and spear.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Testimony of martyrs</font></p>
 The word martyr, from the Greek, means witness; but
 those who testified for Truth were so often persecuted
 unto death, that at length the word martyr
 was narrowed in its significance and so has
 come always to mean one who suffers for his convictions.
 The new faith in the Christ, Truth, so roused the hatred
 of the opponents of Christianity, that the followers of
 Christ were burned, crucified, and  otherwise  persecuted;
 and so it came about that human rights were hallowed
 by the gallows and the cross.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Absence of Christ-power</font></p>
 Man-made doctrines are waning. They have  not  waxed
 strong in times of trouble. Devoid of the Christ-power,
 how can they illustrate the doctrines of Christ
 or the miracles of grace? Denial of the possibility of Christian healing robs Christianity of the very
 element, which gave it divine force and its astonishing and
 unequalled success in the first century.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Basis of miracles</font></p>
 The true Logos is demonstrably Christian Science, the
 natural law of harmony which overcomes discord,--not
 because this Science is supernatural or preternatural, nor because it is an infraction of
 divine law, but because it is the immutable law of God,
 good. Jesus said: "I knew that Thou hearest me always;" and he raised Lazarus from the dead, stilled the
 tempest, healed the sick, walked on the water. There
 is divine authority for believing in the superiority of
 spiritual power over material resistance.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Lawful wonders</font></p>
 A miracle fulfils God's law, but does not violate that
 law. This fact at present seems more mysterious than
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_135"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 135</font></a></p><p></p><p>the miracle itself. The Psalmist sang: "What ailed
 thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? Thou Jordan,
 that thou wast driven back? Ye mountains,
 that ye skipped like rams, and ye little hills,
 like lambs? Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the
 Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob." The miracle
 introduces no disorder, but unfolds the primal order,
 establishing the Science of God's unchangeable law.
 Spiritual evolution alone is worthy of the exercise of
 divine power.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fear and sickness identical</font></p>
 The same power which heals sin heals also sickness.
 This is "the beauty of holiness," that when Truth heals
 the sick it casts out evils, and when Truth
 casts out the evil called disease, it heals the
 sick. When Christ cast out the devil of
 dumbness, "it came to pass, when the devil was gone out,
 the dumb spake." There is to-day danger of repeating
 the offence of the Jews by limiting the Holy One of Israel
 and asking: "Can God furnish a table in the wilderness?"
 What cannot God do?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The unity of Science and Christianity</font></p>
 It has been said, and truly, that Christianity must be
 Science, and Science must be Christianity, else one or the
 other is false and useless; but neither is unimportant or untrue, and they are alike in demonstration. This proves the one to be identical
 with the other. Christianity as Jesus taught it was not
 a creed, nor a system of ceremonies, nor a special gift
 from a ritualistic Jehovah; but it was the demonstration
 of divine Love casting out error and healing the sick,
 not merely in the name of Christ, or Truth, but in demonstration of Truth, as must be the case in the cycles of
 divine light.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_136"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 136</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The Christ-mission</font></p>
 Jesus established his church and maintained his mission
 on a spiritual foundation of Christ-healing. He taught
 his followers that his religion had a divine
 Principle, which would cast out error and heal
 both the sick and the sinning. He claimed no intelligence, action, nor life separate from God. Despite the
 persecution this brought upon him, he used his divine
 power to save men both bodily and spiritually.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ancient spiritualism</font></p>
 The question then as now was, How did Jesus heal the
 sick? His answer to this question the world rejected.
 He appealed to his students: "Whom do
 men say that I, the Son of man, am?" That
 is: Who or what is it that is thus identified with casting
 out evils and healing the sick? They replied, "Some
 say that thou art John the Baptist; some, Elias; and
 others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets." These prophets
 were considered dead, and this reply may indicate that
 some of the people believed that Jesus was a medium,
 controlled by the spirit of John or of Elias.
 <p></p><p>This ghostly fancy was repeated by Herod himself.
 That a wicked king and debauched husband should have
 no high appreciation of divine Science and the great work
 of the Master, was not surprising; for how could such
 a sinner comprehend what the disciples did not fully
 understand? But even Herod doubted if Jesus was controlled by the sainted preacher. Hence Herod's assertion: "John have I beheaded: but who is this?" No
 wonder Herod desired to see the new Teacher.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Doubting disciples</font></p>
 The disciples apprehended their Master better than
 did others; but they did not comprehend all
 that he said and did, or they would not have
 questioned him so often. Jesus patiently persisted in
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_137"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 137</font></a></p><p></p><p>teaching and demonstrating the truth of being. His students saw this power of Truth heal the sick, cast out evil,
 raise the dead; but the ultimate of this wonderful work
 was not spiritually discerned, even by them, until after the
 crucifixion, when their immaculate Teacher stood before
 them, the victor over sickness, sin, disease, death, and
 the grave.
 </p><p></p><p>Yearning to be understood, the Master repeated,
 "But whom say ye that I am?" This renewed inquiry
 meant: Who or what is it that is able to do the work, so
 mysterious to the popular mind? In his rejection of the
 answer already given and his renewal of the question,
 it is plain that Jesus completely eschewed the narrow
 opinion implied in their citation of the common report
 about him.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A divine response</font></p>
 With his usual impetuosity, Simon replied for his
 brethren, and his reply set forth a great fact: "Thou
 art the Christ, the Son of the living God!"
 That is: The Messiah is what thou hast declared,--Christ, the spirit of God, of Truth, Life, and
 Love, which heals mentally. This assertion elicited from
 Jesus the benediction, "Blessed art thou, Simon Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
 but my Father which is in heaven;"  that is, Love hath
 shown thee the way of Life!
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The true and living rock</font></p>
 Before this the impetuous disciple had been called
 only by his common names, Simon Bar-jona, or son of
 Jona; but now the Master gave him a spiritual name in these words: "And I say also
 unto thee, That thou art Peter; and upon this rock [the
 meaning of the Greek word petros, or stone] I will build
 my church; and the gates of hell [hades, the under<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_138"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 138</font></a></p><p></p><p>world, or the grave] shall not prevail against it." In
 other words, Jesus purposed founding his society, not
 on the personal Peter as a mortal, but on the Godpower which lay behind Peter's confession of the true
 Messiah.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sublime summary</font></p>
 It was now evident to Peter that divine Life, Truth, and
 Love, and not a human personality, was the healer of the
 sick and a rock, a firm foundation in the realm
 of harmony. On this spiritually scientific basis
 Jesus explained his cures, which appeared miraculous to
 outsiders. He showed that diseases were cast out neither
 by corporeality, by materia medica, nor by hygiene, but by
 the divine Spirit, casting out the errors of mortal mind.
 The supremacy of Spirit was the foundation on which
 Jesus built. His sublime summary points to the religion
 of Love.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">New era in Jesus</font></p>
 Jesus established in the Christian era the precedent for
 all Christianity, theology, and healing. Christians are
 under as direct orders now, as they were then,
 to be Christlike, to possess the Christ-spirit, to
 follow the Christ-example, and to heal the sick as well as
 the sinning. It is easier for Christianity to cast out sickness than sin, for the sick are more willing to part with
 pain than are sinners to give up the sinful, so-called pleasure of the senses. The Christian can prove this to-day as
 readily is it was proved centuries ago.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Healthful theology</font></p>
 Our Master said to every follower: "Go ye into all the
 world, and preach the gospel to every creature! . . .
 Heal the sick! . . . Love thy neighbor as
 thyself!" It was this theology of Jesus which
 healed the sick and the sinning. It is his theology in this
 book and the spiritual meaning of this theology, which
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_139"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 139</font></a></p><p></p><p>heals the sick and causes the wicked to "forsake his way,
 and the unrighteous man his thoughts." It was our Master's theology which the impious sought to destroy.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Marvels and reformations</font></p>
 From beginning to end, the Scriptures are full of
 accounts of the triumph of Spirit, Mind, over matter.
 Moses proved the power of Mind by what men
 called miracles ; so did Joshua, Elijah, and
 Elisha. The Christian era was ushered in with signs and
 wonders. Reforms have commonly been attended with
 bloodshed and persecution, even when the end has been
 brightness and peace; but the present new, yet old, reform in religious faith will teach men patiently and wisely
 to stem the tide of sectarian bitterness, whenever it flows
 inward.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Science obscured</font></p>
 The decisions by vote of Church Councils as to what
 should and should not be considered Holy Writ; the manifest mistakes in the ancient versions; the
 thirty thousand different readings in the Old
 Testament, and the three hundred thousand in the New,
 - these facts show how a mortal and material sense stole
 into the divine record, with its own hue darkening to some
 extent the inspired pages. But mistakes could neither
 wholly obscure the divine Science of the Scriptures seen
 from Genesis to Revelation, mar the demonstration of
 Jesus, nor annul the healing by the prophets, who foresaw
 that "the stone which the builders rejected" would become "the head of the corner."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Opponents benefited</font></p>
 Atheism, pantheism, theosophy, and agnosticism are
 opposed to Christian Science, as they are to ordinary religion; but it does not follow that the profane
 or atheistic invalid cannot be healed by Christian Science. The moral condition of such a man de<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_140"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 140</font></a></p><p></p><p>mands the remedy of Truth more than it is needed in most
 cases; and Science is more than usually effectual in the
 treatment of moral ailments.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God invisible to the senses</font></p>
 That God is a corporeal being, nobody can truly affirm.
 The Bible represents Him as saying: "Thou canst not
 see My face; for there shall no man see Me
 and live." Not materially but spiritually we
 know Him as divine Mind, as Life, Truth, and Love. We
 shall obey and adore in proportion as we apprehend the
 divine nature and love Him understandingly, warring no
 more over the corporeality, but rejoicing in the affluence
 of our God. Religion will then be of the heart and not of
 the head. Mankind will no longer be tyrannical and proscriptive from lack of love,--straining out gnats and
 swallowing camels.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The true worship</font></p>
 We worship spiritually, only as we cease to worship
 materially. Spiritual devoutness is the soul of Christianity. Worshipping through the  medium  of
 matter is paganism. Judaic and other rituals
 are but types and shadows of true worship. "The true
 worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in
 truth."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Anthropomorphism</font></p>
 The Jewish tribal Jehovah was a man-projected God,
 liable to wrath, repentance, and human changeableness.
 The Christian Science God is universal, eternal, divine love, which changeth not and causeth no evil, disease, nor death. It is indeed mournfully
 true that the older Scripture is reversed. In the begining God created man in His, God's, image; but mortals would procreate man, and make God in their own
 human image. What is the god of a mortal, but a mortal
 magnified?
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_141"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 141</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">More than profession required</font></p>
 This indicates the distance between the theological and
 ritualistic religion of the ages and the truth preached by
 Jesus. More than profession is requisite for
 Christian demonstration. Few understand or
 adhere to Jesus' divine precepts for living and
 healing. Why? Because his precepts require the disciple to cut off the right hand and pluck out the right eye,
 - that is, to set aside even the most cherished beliefs
 and practices, to leave all for Christ.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No ecclesiastical monopoly</font></p>
 All revelation (such is the popular thought!) must come
 from the schools and along the line of scholarly and ecclesiastical descent, as kings are crowned from a
 royal dynasty. In healing the sick and sinning,
 Jesus elaborated the fact that the healing effect
 followed the understanding of the divine Principle and
 of the Christ-spirit which governed the corporeal Jesus.
 For this Principle there is no dynasty, no ecclesiastical
 monopoly. Its only crowned head is immortal sovereignty. Its only priest is the spiritualized man. The
 Bible declares that all believers are made "kings and
 priests unto God." The outsiders did not then, and
 do not now, understand this ruling of the Christ; therefore they cannot demonstrate God's healing power.
 Neither can this manifestation of Christ be comprehended, until its divine Principle is scientifically
 understood.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A change demanded</font></p>
 The adoption of scientific religion and of divine healing will ameliorate sin, sickness, and death. Let our
 pulpits do justice to Christian Science.  Let
 it have fair representation by the press. Give
 to it the place in our institutions of learning now occupied by scholastic theology and physiology, and it will
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_142"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 142</font></a></p><p></p><p>eradicate sickness and sin in less time than the old systems,
 devised for subduing them, have required for self-establishment and propagation.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Two claims omitted</font></p>
 Anciently the followers of Christ, or Truth, measured
 Christianity by its power over sickness, sin, and death;
 but modern religions generally omit all but one
 of these powers,--the power over sin. We 
 must seek the undivided garment, the whole Christ, as our
 first proof of Christianity, for Christ, Truth, alone can
 furnish us with absolute evidence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Selfishness and loss</font></p>
 If the soft palm, upturned to a lordly salary, and architectural skill, making dome and spire tremulous with
 beauty, turn the poor and the stranger from the
 gate, they at the same time shut the door on
 progress.  In vain do the manger and the cross tell their
 story to pride and fustian. Sensuality palsies the right
 hand, and causes the left to let go its grasp on the divine.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Temple cleansed</font></p>
 As in Jesus' time, so to-day, tyranny and pride need to
 be whipped out of the temple, and humility and divine Science to be welcomed in. The strong cords of
 scientific demonstration, as twisted  and  wielded
 by Jesus,  are still needed to purge the temples of their
 vain traffic in worldly worship and to make them meet
 dwelling-places for the Most High.
 <p></p><center>MEDICINE</center>
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Question of precedence</font></p>
 Which was first, Mind  or  medicine?  If  Mind  was
 first and self-existent, then Mind, not matter, must have
 been the first  medicine.  God  being  All-inall, He made medicine; but that medicine was
 Mind. It could not have  been  matter,  which  departs
 from the nature and  character  of  Mind,  God.  Truth
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_143"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 143</font></a></p><p></p><p>is God's remedy for error of every kind, and Truth destroys only what is untrue. Hence the fact that, to-day,
 as yesterday, Christ casts out evils and heals the
 sick.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Methods rejected</font></p>
 It is plain that God does not employ drugs or hygiene,
 nor provide them for human use; else Jesus would have
 recommended and employed them in his healing. The sick are more deplorably lost than
 the sinning, if the sick cannot rely on God for help and
 the sinning can. The divine Mind never called matter
 medicine, and matter required a material and human belief before it could be considered as medicine.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error not curative</font></p>
 Sometimes the human mind uses one error to medicine another. Driven to choose between two difficulties,
 the human mind takes the lesser to relieve the
 greater. On this basis it saves from starvation by theft, and quiets pain with anodynes. You
 admit that mind influences the body somewhat, but
 you conclude that the stomach, blood, nerves, bones,
 etc., hold the preponderance of power. Controlled by
 this belief, you continue in the old routine. You lean on
 the inert and unintelligent, never discerning how this deprives you of the available superiority of divine Mind.
 The body is not controlled scientifically by a negative
 mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Impossible coalescence</font></p>
 Mind is the grand creator, and there can be no power
 except that which is derived from Mind. If Mind was
 first chronologically, is first potentially, and
 must be first eternally, then give to Mind the
 glory, honor, dominion, and power everlastingly due its
 holy name. Inferior and unspiritual methods of healing
 may try to make Mind and drugs coalesce, but the two will
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_144"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 144</font></a></p><p></p><p>not mingle scientifically. Why should we wish to make
 them do so, since no good can come of it?
 </p><p></p><p>If Mind is foremost and superior, let us rely upon Mind,
 which needs no cooperation from lower powers, even if
 these so-called powers are real.
 </p><p></p><p>   Naught is the squire, when the king is nigh;
    Withdraws the star, when dawns the sun's brave light.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soul and sense</font></p>
 The various mortal beliefs formulated in human philosophy, physiology, hygiene, are mainly predicated of matter,
 and afford faint gleams of God, or Truth.
 The more material a belief, the more obstinately
 tenacious its error; the stronger are the manifestations of
 the corporeal senses, the weaker the indications of Soul.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Will-power detrimental</font></p>
 Human will-power is not Science. Human will belongs
 to the so-called material senses, and its use is to be condemned. Willing the sick to recover is not the
 metaphysical practice of Christian Science, but
 is sheer animal magnetism. Human will-power may infringe the rights of man. It produces evil continually,
 and is not a factor in the realism of being. Truth, and
 not corporeal will, is the divine power which says to
 disease, "Peace, be still."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Conservative antagonism</font></p>
 Because divine Science wars with so-called physical
 science, even as Truth wars with error, the old schools
 still oppose it. Ignorance, pride, or prejudice
 closes the door to whatever is not stereotyped.
 When the Science of being is universally understood,
 every man will be his own physician, and Truth will be
 the universal panacea.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ancient healers</font></p>
 It is a question to-day, whether the ancient inspired
 healers understood the Science of Christian healing, or
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a></p><p></p><p>whether they caught its sweet tones, as the natural
 musician catches the tones of harmony, without being
 able to explain them. So divinely imbued
 were they with the spirit of Science, that the
 lack of the letter could not hinder their work; and that
 letter, without the spirit, would have made void their
 practice.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The struggle and victory</font></p>
 The struggle for the recovery of invalids goes on, not
 between material methods, but between mortal minds
 and immortal Mind. The victory will be on 
 the patient's side only as immortal Mind 
 through Christ, Truth, subdues the human belief in
 disease. It matters not what material method one may
 adopt, whether faith in drugs, trust in hygiene, or reliance
 on some other minor curative.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mystery of godliness</font></p>
 Scientific healing has this advantage over other methods,--that in it Truth controls error. From this fact
 arise its ethical as well as its physical effects. Indeed, its ethical and physical effects
 are indissolubly connected. If there is any mystery
 in Christian healing, it is the mystery which godliness
 always presents to the ungodly,--the mystery always
 arising from ignorance of the laws of eternal and unerring Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter versus matter</font></p>
 Other methods undertake to oppose error with error,
 and thus they increase the antagonism of one form of
 matter towards other forms of matter or error, 
 and the warfare between Spirit and the flesh
 goes on. By this antagonism mortal mind must continually weaken its own assumed power.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">How healing was lost</font></p>
 The theology of Christian Science includes healing
 the sick. Our Master's first article of faith propounded
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_146"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 146</font></a></p><p></p><p>to his students was healing, and he proved his faith by
 his works. The ancient Christians were healers. Why
 has this element of Christianity been lost?
 Because our systems of religion are governed
 more or less by our systems of medicine. The first idolatry was faith in matter. The schools have rendered 
 faith in drugs the fashion, rather than faith in Deity. By
 trusting matter to destroy its own discord, health and
 harmony have been sacrificed. Such systems are barren
 of the vitality of spiritual power, by which material sense
 is made the servant of Science and religion becomes
 Christlike.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Drugs and divinity</font></p>
 Material medicine substitutes drugs for the power of
 God--even the might of Mind--to heal the body.
 Scholasticism clings for salvation to the person, instead of to the divine Principle, of the
 man Jesus; and his Science, the curative agent of God,
 is silenced. Why? Because truth divests material drugs
 of their imaginary power, and clothes Spirit with supremacy. Science is the "stranger that is within thy gates,"
 remembered not, even when its elevating effects practically prove its divine origin and efficacy.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christian Science as old as God</font></p>
 Divine Science derives its sanction from the Bible,
 and the divine origin of Science is demonstrated through
 the holy influence of Truth in healing sickness and sin. This healing power of Truth
 must have been far anterior to the period in
 which Jesus lived. It is as ancient as "the Ancient of
 days." It lives through all Life, and extends throughout
 all space.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reduction to system</font></p>
 Divine metaphysics is now reduced to a system, to a
 form comprehensible by and adapted to the thought of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_147"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 147</font></a></p><p></p><p>the age in which we live.  This system enables the
 learner to demonstrate the divine Principle,
 upon which Jesus' healing was based, and
 the sacred rules for its present application to the cure of
 disease.
 </p><p></p><p>Late in the nineteenth century I demonstrated the divine
 rules of Christian Science. They were submitted to the
 broadest practical test, and everywhere, when honestly applied under circumstances where demonstration was humanly possible, this Science showed that Truth had lost
 none of its divine and healing efficacy, even though centuries had passed away since Jesus practised these rules
 on the hills of Judaea and in the valleys of Galilee.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Perusal and practice</font></p>
 Although this volume contains the complete Science of
 Mind-healing, never believe that you can absorb the whole
 meaning of the Science by a simple perusal
 of this book. The book needs to be studied,
 and the demonstration of the rules of scientific healing
 will plant you firmly on the spiritual groundwork of
 Christian Science. This proof lifts you high above the
 perishing fossils of theories already antiquated, and enables you to grasp the spiritual facts of being hitherto
 unattained and seemingly dim.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A definite rule discovered</font></p>
 Our Master healed the sick, practised Christian healing, and taught the generalities of its divine Principle to
 his students; but he left no definite rule for
 demonstrating this Principle of healing and
 preventing disease. This rule remained to be discovered
 in Christian Science. A pure affection takes form in goodness, but Science alone reveals the divine Principle of
 goodness and demonstrates its rules.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jesus' own practice</font></p>
 Jesus never spoke of disease as dangerous or as difficult
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_148"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 148</font></a></p><p></p><p>to heal. When his students brought to him a case they
 had failed to heal, he said to them, "O faithless generation," implying that the requisite power
 to heal was in Mind. He prescribed no drugs,
 urged no obedience to material laws, but acted in direct
 disobedience to them.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The man of anatomy and of theology</font></p>
 Neither anatomy nor theology has ever described man
 as created by Spirit, - as God's man. The former explains the men of men, or the "children of
 men," as created corporeally instead of spiritually and as emerging from the lowest, instead of from the highest, conception of being. Both
 anatomy and theology define man as both physical and
 mental, and place mind at the mercy of matter for every
 function, formation, and manifestation. Anatomy takes
 up man at all points materially. It loses Spirit, drops the
 true tone, and accepts the discord. Anatomy and theology reject the divine Principle which produces harmonious man, and deal--the one wholly, the other primarily
 - with matter, calling that man which is not the counterpart, but the counterfeit, of God's man. Then theology
 tries to explain how to make this man a Christian,--how
 from this basis of division and discord to produce the concord and unity of Spirit and His likeness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Physiology deficient</font></p>
 Physiology exalts matter, dethrones Mind, and claims
 to rule man by material law, instead of spiritual. When
 physiology fails to give health or life by this
 process, it ignores the divine Spirit as unable
 or unwilling to render help in time of physical need.
 When mortals sin, this ruling of the schools leaves them
 to the guidance of a theology which admits God to be
 the healer of sin but not of sickness, although our great
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_149"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 149</font></a></p><p></p><p>Master demonstrated that Truth could save from sickness
 as well as from sin.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Blunders and blunderers</font></p>
 Mind as far outweighs drugs in the cure of disease as
 in the cure of sin.  The more excellent way is divine
 Science in every case.  Is materia medica a
 science or a bundle of speculative human
 theories? The prescription which succeeds in one instance fails in another, and this is owing to the different
 mental states of the patient. These states are not comprehended and they are left without explanation except
 in Christian Science. The rule and its perfection of operation never vary in Science. If you fail to succeed in any
 case, it is because you have not demonstrated the life of
 Christ, Truth, more in your own life,--because you have
 not obeyed the rule and proved the Principle of divine
 Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Old-school physician</font></p>
 A physician of the old school remarked with great
 gravity: "We know that mind affects the body somewhat, and advise our patients to be hopeful
 and cheerful and to take as little medicine as
 possible; but mind can never cure organic difficulties."
 The logic is lame, and facts contradict it. The author
 has cured what is termed organic disease as readily as she
 has cured purely functional disease, and with no power
 but the divine Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Tests in our day</font></p>
 Since God, divine Mind, governs all, not partially but
 supremely, predicting disease does not dignify therapeutics.
 Whatever guides thought spiritually benefits
 mind and body. We need to understand the
 affirmations of divine Science, dismiss superstition, and
 demonstrate truth according to Christ. To-day there
 is hardly a city, village, or hamlet, in which are not to
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_150"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 150</font></a></p><p></p><p>be found living witnesses and monuments to the virtue
 and power of Truth, as applied through this Christian
 system of healing disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The main purpose</font></p>
 To-day the healing power of Truth is widely demonstrated as an immanent, eternal Science, instead of a
 phenomenal exhibition. Its appearing is the
 coming anew of the gospel of "on earth peace,
 good-will toward men." This coming, as was promised
 by the Master, is for its establishment as a permanent
 dispensation among men; but the mission of Christian
 Science now, as in the time of its earlier demonstration,
 is not primarily one of physical healing. Now, as then,
 signs and wonders are wrought in the metaphysical healing of physical disease; but these signs are only to demonstrate its divine origin,--to attest the reality of the higher
 mission of the Christ-power to take away the sins of the
 world.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Exploded doctrine</font></p>
 The science (so-called) of physics would have one believe that both matter and mind are subject to disease,
 and that, too, in spite of the individual's protest and contrary to the law of divine Mind.
 This human view infringes man's free moral agency; and
 it is as evidently erroneous to the author, and will be to
 all others at some future day, as the practically rejected
 doctrine of the predestination of souls to damnation or
 salvation. The doctrine that man's harmony is governed by physical conditions all his earthly days, and that
 he is then thrust out of his own body by the operation of
 matter,--even the doctrine of the superiority of matter
 over Mind,--is fading out.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease mental</font></p>
 The hosts of AEsculapius are flooding the world with
 diseases, because they are ignorant that the human mind
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_151"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 151</font></a></p><p></p><p>and body are myths. To be sure, they sometimes treat
 the sick as if there was but one factor in the case; but
 this one factor they represent to be body, not
 mind. Infinite Mind could not possibly create
 a remedy outside of itself, but erring, finite, human mind
 has an absolute need of something beyond itself for its
 redemption and healing.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Intentions respected</font></p>
 Great respect is due the motives and philanthropy of
 the higher class of physicians. We know that if they understood the Science of Mind-healing, and were
 in possession of the enlarged power it confers 
 to benefit the race physically and spiritually, they would
 rejoice with us. Even this one reform in medicine would
 ultimately deliver mankind from the awful and oppressive bondage now enforced by false theories, from which
 multitudes would gladly escape.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man governed by Mind</font></p>
 Mortal belief says that death has been occasioned by
 fright. Fear never stopped being and its action. The
 blood, heart, lungs, brain, etc., have nothing
 to do with Life, God. Every function of the
 real man is governed by the divine Mind. The human
 mind has no power to kill or to cure, and it has no comtrol over God's man. The divine Mind that made man
 maintains His own image and likeness. The human
 mind is opposed to God and must be put off, as St. Paul
 declares. All that really exists is the divine Mind and
 its idea, and in this Mind the entire being is found harmonious and eternal. The straight and narrow way is to
 see and acknowledge this fact, yield to this power, and
 follow the leadings of truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal mind dethroned</font></p>
 That mortal mind claims to govern every organ of the
 mortal body, we have overwhelming proof. But this so<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_152"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 152</font></a></p><p></p><p>called mind is a myth, and must by its own consent yield
 to Truth. It would wield the sceptre of a monarch, but
 it is powerless. The immortal divine Mind
 takes away all its supposed sovereignty, and
 saves mortal mind from itself. The author has endeavored
 to make this book the AEsculapius of mind as well as of
 body, that it may give hope to the sick and heal them,
 although they know not how the work is done. Truth
 has a healing effect, even when not fully understood.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">All activity from thought</font></p>
 Anatomy describes muscular action as produced by
 mind in one instance and not in another. Such errors
 beset every material theory, in which one
 statement contradicts another over and over
 again. It is related that Sir Humphry Davy once apparently cured a case of paralysis simply by introducing
 a thermometer into the patient's mouth. This he did
 merely to ascertain the temperature of the patient's body;
 but the sick man supposed this ceremony was intended
 to heal him, and he recovered accordingly. Such a fact
 illustrates our theories.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The author's experiments in medicine</font></p>
 The author's medical researches and experiments had
 prepared her thought for the metaphysics of Christian
 Science. Every material dependence had
 failed her in her search for truth; and she can
 now understand why, and can see the means
 by which mortals are divinely driven to a spiritual source
 for health and happiness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Homoeopathic attenuations</font></p>
 Her experiments in homoeopathy had made her skeptical as to material curative methods.  Jahr, from
 Aconitum to Zincum oxydatum, enumerates
 the general symptoms, the characteristic
 signs, which demand different remedies; but the drug
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_153"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 153</font></a></p><p></p><p>is frequently attenuated to such a degree that not a vestige of it remains. Thus we learn that it is not the drug
 which expels the disease or changes one of the symptoms
 of disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Only salt and water</font></p>
 The author has attenuated Natrum muriaticum (common table-salt) until there was not a single saline property
 left. The salt had "lost his savour;" and yet,
 with one drop of that attenuation in a goblet of
 water, and a teaspoonful of the water administered at intervals of three hours, she has cured a patient sinking in
 the last stage of typhoid fever. The highest attenuation
 of homoeopathy and the most potent rises above matter into
 mind. This discovery leads to more light. From it may
 be learned that either human faith or the divine Mind is
 the healer and that there is no efficacy in a drug.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Origin of pain</font></p>
 You say a boil is painful; but that is impossible, for
 matter without mind is not painful. The boil simply
 manifests, through inflammation and swelling, a belief in pain, and this belief is called a
 boil. Now administer mentally to your patient a high
 attenuation of truth, and it will soon cure the boil. The
 fact that pain cannot exist where there is no mortal mind
 to feel it is a proof that this so-called mind makes its
 own pain--that is, its own belief in pain.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Source of contagion</font></p>
 We weep because others weep, we yawn because they
 yawn, and we have smallpox because others have it; but
 mortal mind, not matter, contains and carries
 the infection. When this mental contagion is
 understood, we shall be more careful of our mental conditions and we shall avoid loquacious tattling about
 disease, as we would avoid advocating crime. Neither
 sympathy nor society should ever tempt us to cherish
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_154"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 154</font></a></p><p></p><p>error in any form, and certainly we should not be error's
 advocate.
 </p><p></p><p>Disease arises, like other mental conditions, from association. Since it is a law of mortal mind that certain
 diseases should be regarded as contagious, this law obtains credit through association,--calling up the fear that
 creates the image of disease and its consequent manifestation in the body.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Imaginary cholera</font></p>
 This fact in metaphysics is illustrated by the following
 incident: A man was made to believe that he occupied a
 bed where a cholera patient had died. Immediately the symptoms of this disease appeared,
 and the man died. The fact was, that he had not caught
 the cholera by material contact, because no cholera patient
 had been in that bed.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Children's ailments</font></p>
 If a child is exposed to contagion or infection, the
 mother is frightened and says, "My child will be sick."
 The law of mortal mind and her own fears govern her child more than the child's mind governs itself, and they produce the very results which might
 have been prevented through the opposite understanding.
 Then it is believed that exposure to the contagion wrought
 the mischief.
 <p></p><p>That mother is not a Christian Scientist, and her affections need better guidance, who says to her child: "You
 look sick," "You look tired," "You need rest," or "You
 need medicine."
 </p><p></p><p>Such a mother runs to her little one, who thinks she has
 hurt her face by falling on the carpet, and says, moaning
 more childishly than her child, "Mamma knows you are
 hurt." The better and more successful method for any
 mother to adopt is to say: "Oh, never mind! You're not
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_155"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 155</font></a></p><p></p><p>hurt, so don't think you are." Presently the child forgets
 all about the accident, and is at play.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Drug-power mental</font></p>
 When the sick recover by the use of drugs, it is the law
 of a general belief, culminating in individual faith, which
 heals; and according to this faith will the effect
 be. Even when you take away the individual
 confidence in the drug, you have not yet divorced the drug
 from the general faith. The chemist, the botanist, the
 druggist, the doctor, and the nurse equip the medicine
 with their faith, and the beliefs which are in the majority
 rule. When the general belief endorses the inanimate
 drug as doing this or that, individual dissent or faith, unless it rests on Science, is but a belief held by a minority,
 and such a belief is governed by the majority.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Belief in physics</font></p>
 The universal belief in physics weighs against the high
 and mighty truths of Christian metaphysics. This erroneous general belief, which sustains medicine and
 produces all medical results, works against
 Christian Science; and the percentage of power on the
 side of this Science must mightily outweigh the power of
 popular belief in order to heal a single case of disease. The
 human mind acts more powerfully to offset the discords
 of matter and the ills of flesh, in proportion as it puts less
 weight into the material or fleshly scale and more weight
 into the spiritual scale. Homoeopathy diminishes the
 drug, but the potency of the medicine increases as the
 drug disappears.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Nature of drugs</font></p>
 Vegetarianism,  homoeopathy,  and  hydropathy  have
 diminished drugging; but if drugs are an antidote to
 disease, why lessen the antidote? If drugs
 are good things, is it safe to say that the
 less in quantity you have of them the better? If drugs
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a></p><p></p><p>possess intrinsic virtues or intelligent curative qualities,
 these qualities must be mental. Who named drugs, and
 what made them good or bad for mortals, beneficial or
 injurious?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Dropsy cured without drugs</font></p>
 A case of dropsy, given up by the faculty, fell into
 my hands. It was a terrible case. Tapping had been
 employed, and yet, as she lay in her bed, the
 patient looked like a barrel. I prescribed
 the fourth attenuation of Argentum nitratum with occasional doses of a high attenuation of Sulphuris. She improved perceptibly. Believing then somewhat in the
 ordinary theories of medical practice, and learning that
 her former physician had prescribed these remedies, I
 began to fear an aggravation of symptoms from their
 prolonged use, and told the patient so; but she was
 unwilling to give up the medicine while she was recovering. It then occurred to me to give her unmedicated pellets and watch the result. I did so, and
 she continued to gain. Finally she said that she would
 give up her medicine for one day, and risk  the
 effects. After trying this, she informed me that she
 could get along two days without globules; but on
 the third day she again suffered, and was relieved by
 taking them. She went on in this way, taking the
 unmedicated pellets,--and receiving occasional visits
 from me,--but employing no other means, and she was
 cured.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A stately advance</font></p>
 Metaphysics, as taught in Christian Science, is the
 next stately step beyond homoeopathy. In metaphysics,
 matter disappears from the remedy entirely,
 and Mind takes its rightful and supreme
 place. Homoeopathy takes mental symptoms largely
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a></p><p></p><p>into consideration in its diagnosis of disease. Christian
 Science deals wholly with the mental cause in judging and
 destroying disease. It succeeds where homoeopathy fails,
 solely because its one recognized Principle of healing is
 Mind, and the whole force of the mental element is employed through the Science of Mind, which never shares
 its rights with inanimate matter.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The modus of homoeopathy</font></p>
 Christian Science exterminates the drug, and rests on
 Mind alone as the curative Principle, acknowledging that
 the divine Mind has all power. Homoeopathy
 mentalizes a drug with such repetition of
 thought-attenuations, that the drug becomes
 more like the human mind than the substratum of this socalled mind, which we call matter; and the drug's power
 of action is proportionately increased.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Drugging unchristian</font></p>
 If drugs are part of God's creation, which (according
 to the narrative in Genesis) He pronounced good, then
 drugs cannot be poisonous. If He could create drugs intrinsically bad, then they should
 never be used. If He creates drugs at all and designs
 them for medical use, why did Jesus not employ them
 and recommend them for the treatment of disease?
 Matter is not self-creative, for it is unintelligent. Erring
 mortal mind confers the power which the drug seems to
 possess.
 <p></p><p>Narcotics quiet mortal mind, and so relieve the body;
 but they leave both mind and body worse for this submission. Christian Science impresses the entire corporeality,--namely, mind and body,--and brings out the
 proof that Life is continuous and harmonious. Science
 both neutralizes error and destroys it. Mankind is the
 better for this spiritual and profound pathology.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_158"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 158</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mythology and materia medica</font></p>
 It is recorded that the profession of medicine originated
 in idolatry with pagan priests, who besought the gods to
 heal the sick and designated Apollo as "the god
 of medicine." He was supposed to have dictated the first prescription, according to the
 "History of Four Thousand Years of Medicine." It is
 here noticeable that Apollo was also regarded as the sender
 of disease, "the god of pestilence." Hippocrates turned
 from image-gods to vegetable and mineral drugs for healing. This was deemed progress in medicine; but
 what we need is the truth which heals both mind and
 body. The future history of material medicine may
 correspond with that of its material god, Apollo, who was
 banished from heaven and endured great sufferings
 upon earth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Footsteps to intemperance</font></p>
 Drugs, cataplasms, and whiskey are stupid substitutes
 for the dignity and potency of divine Mind and its efficacy to heal. It is pitiful to lead men into
 temptation through the byways of this wilderness world,--to victimize the race with intoxicating
 prescriptions for the sick, until mortal mind acquires an
 educated appetite for strong drink, and men and women
 become loathsome sots.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Advancing degrees</font></p>
 Evidences of progress and of spiritualization greet us
 on every hand. Drug-systems are quitting their hold on
 matter and so letting in matter's higher stratum, mortal mind. Homoeopathy, a step in
 advance of allopathy, is doing this. Matter is going out
 of medicine; and mortal mind, of a higher attenuation
 than the drug, is governing the pellet.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Effects of fear</font></p>
 A woman in the city of Lynn, Massachusetts, was
 etherized and died in consequence, although her physi<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_159"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 159</font></a></p><p></p><p>cians insisted that it would be unsafe to perform a needed
 surgical operation without the ether. After the autopsy,
 her sister testified that the deceased protested
 against inhaling the ether and said it would kill
 her, but that she was compelled by her physicians to take
 it. Her hands were held, and she was forced into submission. The case was brought to trial. The evidence
 was found to be conclusive, and a verdict was returned that
 death was occasioned, not by the ether, but by fear of
 inhaling it.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental conditions to be heeded</font></p>
 Is it skilful or scientific surgery to take no heed of mental conditions and to treat the patient as if she were so
 much mindless matter, and as if matter were
 the only factor to be consulted? Had these 
 unscientific surgeons understood metaphysics,
 they would have considered the woman's state of mind,
 and not have risked such treatment. They would either
 have allayed her fear or would have performed the operation without ether.
 <p></p><p>The sequel proved that this Lynn woman died from
 effects produced by mortal mind, and not from the disease
 or the operation.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">False source of knowledge</font></p>
 The medical schools would learn the state of man
 from matter instead of from Mind. They examine the
 lungs, tongue, and pulse to ascertain how
 much harmony, or health, matter is permitting to matter,--how much pain or pleasure, action or
 stagnation, one form of matter is allowing another form
 of matter.
 <p></p><p>Ignorant of the fact that a man's belief produces disease and all its symptoms, the ordinary physician is
 liable to increase disease with his own mind, when he
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_160"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 160</font></a></p><p></p><p>should address himself to the work of destroying it through
 the power of the divine Mind.
 </p><p></p><p>The systems of physics act against metaphysics, and
 vice versa. When mortals forsake the material for the
 spiritual basis of action, drugs lose their healing force,
 for they have no innate power. Unsupported by the
 faith reposed in it, the inanimate drug becomes
 powerless.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Obedient muscles</font></p>
 The motion of the arm is no more dependent upon the
 direction of mortal mind, than are the organic action and
 secretion of the viscera. When this so-called
 mind quits the body, the heart becomes as torpid as the hand.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Anatomy and mind</font></p>
 Anatomy finds a necessity for nerves to convey the mandate of mind to muscle and so cause action; but what does
 anatomy say when the cords contract and become immovable? Has mortal mind ceased
 speaking to them, or has it bidden them to be impotent?
 Can muscles, bones, blood, and nerves rebel against mind
 in one instance and not in another, and become cramped
 despite the mental protest?
 <p></p><p>Unless muscles are self-acting at all times, they are
 never so,--never capable of acting contrary to mental
 direction. If muscles can cease to act and become rigid
 of their own preference,--be deformed or symmetrical,
 as they please or as disease directs, - they must be selfdirecting. Why then consult anatomy to learn how mortal mind governs muscle, if we are only to learn from
 anatomy that muscle is not so governed?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind over matter</font></p>
 Is man a material fungus without Mind
 to help him? Is a stiff joint or a contracted
 muscle as much a result of law as the supple and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_161"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 161</font></a></p><p></p><p>elastic condition of the healthy limb, and is God the
 lawgiver?
 </p><p></p><p>You say, "I have burned my finger." This is an
 exact statement, more exact than you suppose; for mortal mind, and not matter, burns it. Holy inspiration
 has created states of mind which have been able to nullify
 the action of the flames, as in the Bible case of the three
 young Hebrew captives, cast into the Babylonian furnace;
 while an opposite mental state might produce spontaneous 
 combustion.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Restrictive regulations</font></p>
 In 1880, Massachusetts put her foot on a proposed
 tyrannical law, restricting the practice of medicine. If
 her sister States follow this example in harmony with our Constitution and Bill of Rights,
 they will do less violence to that immortal sentiment of the
 Declaration, "Man is endowed by his Maker with certain
 inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty, and the
 pursuit of happiness."
 <p></p><p>The oppressive state statutes touching medicine remind one of the words of the famous Madame Roland,
 as she knelt before a statue of Liberty, erected near the
 guillotine: "Liberty, what crimes are committed in thy
 name!"
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Metaphysics challenges physics</font></p>
 The ordinary practitioner, examining bodily symptoms,
 telling the patient that he is sick, and treating the case according to his physical diagnosis, would naturally induce the very disease he is trying to cure, 
 even if it were not already determined by mortal mind. Such unconscious mistakes would not occur, if
 this old class of philanthropists looked as deeply for cause
 and effect into mind as into matter. The physician agrees
 with his "adversary quickly," but upon different terms
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_162"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 162</font></a></p><p></p><p>than does the metaphysician; for the matter-physician
 agrees with the disease, while the metaphysician agrees
 only with health and challenges disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth an alterative</font></p>
 Christian Science brings to the body the sunlight of
 Truth, which invigorates and purifies. Christian Science
 acts as an alterative, neutralizing error with
 Truth. It changes the secretions, expels humors, dissolves tumors, relaxes rigid muscles, restores
 carious bones to soundness. The effect of this Science is
 to stir the human mind to a change of base, on which it
 may yield to the harmony of the divine Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Practical success</font></p>
 Experiments have favored the fact that Mind governs
 the body, not in one instance, but in every instance. The
 indestructible faculties of Spirit exist without
 the conditions of matter and also without the
 false beliefs of a so-called material existence. Working
 out the rules of Science in practice, the author has restored health in cases of both acute and chronic disease in
 their severest forms. Secretions have been changed, the
 structure has been renewed, shortened limbs have been
 elongated, ankylosed joints have been made supple, and
 carious bones have been restored to healthy conditions. I
 have restored what is called the lost substance of lungs, and
 healthy organizations have been established where disease
 was organic. Christian Science heals organic disease as
 surely as it heals what is called functional, for it requires
 only a fuller understanding of the divine Principle of
 Christian Science to demonstrate the higher rule.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Testimony of medical teachers</font></p>
 With due respect for the faculty, I kindly
 quote from Dr. Benjamin Rush, the famous
 Philadelphia teacher of medical practice. He
 declared that "it is impossible to calculate the mischief
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_163"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 163</font></a></p><p></p><p>which Hippocrates has done, by first marking Nature
 with his name, and afterward letting her loose upon sick
 people."
 </p><p></p><p>Dr. Benjamin Waterhouse, Professor in Harvard University, declared himself "sick of learned quackery."
 </p><p></p><p>Dr. James Johnson, Surgeon to William IV, King Of
 England, said:
 </p><p></p><p>"I declare my conscientious opinion, founded on long
 observation and reflection, that if there were not a single
 physician, surgeon, apothecary, man-midwife, chemist,
 druggist, or drug on the face of the earth, there would be
 less sickness and less mortality."
 </p><p></p><p>Dr. Mason Good, a learned Professor in London,
 said :
 </p><p></p><p>"The effects of medicine on the human system are in
 the highest degree uncertain; except, indeed, that it has
 already destroyed more lives than war, pestilence, and
 famine, all combined."
 </p><p></p><p>Dr. Chapman, Professor of the Institutes and Practice
 of Physic in the University of Pennsylvania, in a published
 essay said
 </p><p></p><p>"Consulting the records of our science, we cannot
 help being disgusted with the multitude of hypotheses
 obtruded upon us at different times. Nowhere is the
 imagination displayed to a greater extent; and perhaps
 so ample an exhibition of human invention might gratify
 our vanity, if it were not more than compensated by the
 humiliating view of so much absurdity, contradiction,
 and falsehood. To harmonize the contrarieties of medical doctrines is indeed a task as impractible as to
 arrange the fleeting vapors around us, or to reconcile the
 fixed and repulsive antipathies of nature. Dark and
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_164"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 164</font></a></p><p></p><p>perplexed, our devious career resembles the groping of
 Homer's Cyclops around his cave."
 </p><p></p><p>Sir John Forbes, M.D., F.R.S., Fellow of the Royal
 College of Physicians, London, said:
 </p><p></p><p>"No systematic or theoretical classification of diseases
 or of therapeutic agents, ever yet promulgated, is true, or
 anything like the truth, and none can be adopted as a safe
 guidance in practice."
 </p><p></p><p>It is just to say that generally the cultured class of medical practitioners are grand men and women, therefore
 they are more scientific than are false claimants to Christian Science. But all human systems based on material
 premises are minus the unction of divine Science. Much
 yet remains to be said and done before all mankind is
 saved and all the mental microbes of sin and all diseased
 thought-germs are exterminated.
 </p><p></p><p>If you or I should appear to die, we should not be
 dead. The seeming decease, caused by a majority of
 human beliefs that man must die, or produced by mental
 assassins, does not in the least disprove Christian Science;
 rather does it evidence the truth of its basic proposition
 that mortal thoughts in belief rule the materiality miscalled life in the body or in matter. But the forever fact
 remains paramount that Life, Truth, and Love save from
 sin, disease, and death. "When this corruptible shall have
 put on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on
 immortality [divine Science], then shall be brought to pass
 the saying that is written, Death is swallowed up in
 victory" (St. Paul).
