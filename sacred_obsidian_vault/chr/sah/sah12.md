 And why art thou disquieted within me?
 Hope thou in God; for I shall yet praise Him,
 Who is the health of my countenance and my God.--PSALMS.
 </p><p>And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they
 cast out devils: they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up
 serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them;
 they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.--JESUS.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A gospel narrative</font></p>
 IT is related in the seventh chapter of Luke's Gospel
 that Jesus was once the honored guest of a certain
 Pharisee, by name Simon, though he was quite unlike
 Simon the disciple. While they were at meat, an unusual
 incident occurred, as if to interrupt the scene
 of Oriental festivity. A "strange woman"
 came in. Heedless of the fact that she was debarred from
 such a place and such society, especially under the stern
 rules of rabbinical law, as positively as if she were a Hindoo pariah intruding upon the household of a high-caste
 Brahman, this woman (Mary Magdalene, as she has
 since been called) approached Jesus. According to the
 custom of those days, he reclined on a couch with his
 head towards the table and his bare feet away from it.
 It was therefore easy for the Magdalen to come behind
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_363"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 363</font></a></p><p></p><p>the couch and reach his feet. She bore an alabaster jar
 containing costly and fragrant oil,--sandal oil perhaps,
 which is in such common use in the East. Breaking 
 the sealed jar, she perfumed Jesus' feet with the oil,
 wiping them with her long hair, which hung loosely
 about her shoulders, as was customary with women of her 
 grade.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Parable of the creditor</font></p>
 Did Jesus spurn the woman? Did he repel her adoration? No! He regarded her compassionately. Nor was 
 this all. Knowing what those around him 
 were saying in their hearts, especially his host, 
 - that they were wondering why, being a prophet, the 
 exalted guest did not at once detect the woman's immoral
 status and bid her depart,--knowing this, Jesus rebuked
 them with a short story or parable. He described two 
 debtors, one for a large sum and one for a smaller, who
 were released from their obligations by their common
 creditor. "Which of them will love him most?" was the 
 Master's question to Simon the Pharisee; and Simon replied, "He to whom he forgave most." Jesus approved
 the answer, and so brought home the lesson to all, following it with that remarkable declaration to the woman,
 "Thy sins are forgiven."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine insight</font></p>
 Why did he thus summarize her debt to divine Love? 
 Had she repented and reformed, and did his insight
 detect this unspoken moral uprising? She
 bathed his feet with her tears before she 
 anointed them with the oil. In the absence of other
 proofs, was her grief sufficient evidence to warrant the
 expectation of her repentance, reformation, and growth 
 in wisdom? Certainly there was encouragement in the
 mere fact that she was showing her affection for a man
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_364"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 364</font></a></p><p></p><p>of undoubted goodness and purity, who has since been
 rightfully regarded as the best man that ever trod this
 planet. Her reverence was unfeigned, and it was manifested towards one who was soon, though they knew it
 not, to lay down his mortal existence in behalf of all
 sinners, that through his word and works they might be
 redeemed from sensuality and sin.
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Penitence or hospitality</font></p>
 Which was the higher tribute to such ineffable affection, the hospitality of the Pharisee or the contrition of
 the Magdalen? This query Jesus answered
 by rebuking self-righteousness and declaring
 the absolution of the penitent. He even said that this
 poor woman had done what his rich entertainer had neglected to do,--wash and anoint his guest's feet, a special
 sign of Oriental courtesy.
 <p></p><p>Here is suggested a solemn question, a question indicated by one of the needs of this age. Do Christian
 Scientists seek Truth as Simon sought the Saviour, through
 material conservatism and for personal homage? Jesus
 told Simon that such seekers as he gave small reward
 in return for the spiritual purgation which came through
 the Messiah. If Christian Scientists are like Simon,
 then it must be said of them also that they love
 little.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Genuine repentance</font></p>
 On the other hand, do they show their regard for
 Truth, or Christ, by their genuine repentance, by their
 broken hearts, expressed by meekness and
 human affection, as did this woman?  If
 so, then it may be said of them, as Jesus said of the
 unwelcome visitor, that they indeed love much, because
 much is forgiven them.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Compassion requisite</font></p>
 Did the careless doctor, the nurse, the cook, and the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_365"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 365</font></a></p><p></p><p>brusque business visitor sympathetically know the thorns 
 they plant in the pillow of the sick and the heavenly
 homesick looking away from earth,--Oh, did 
 they know!--this knowledge would do much  
 more towards healing the sick and preparing their helpers
 for the "midnight call," than all cries of "Lord, Lord!" 
 The benign thought of Jesus, finding utterance in such
 words as "Take no thought for your life," would heal
 the sick, and so enable them to rise above the supposed 
 necessity for physical thought-taking and doctoring;
 but if the unselfish affections be lacking, and common
 sense and common humanity are disregarded, what mental quality remains, with which to evoke healing from
 the outstretched arm of righteousness?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Speedy healing</font></p>
 If the Scientist reaches his patient through divine 
 Love, the healing work will be accomplished at one
 visit, and the disease will vanish into its native
 nothingness like dew before the morning sunshine. If the Scientist has enough Christly affection to
 win his own pardon, and such commendation as the Magdalen gained from Jesus, then he is Christian enough to
 practise scientifically and deal with his patients compassionately; and the result will correspond with the spiritual
 intent.      
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth desecrated</font></p>
 If hypocrisy, stolidity, inhumanity, or vice finds its
 way into the chambers of disease through the would-be
 healer, it would, if it were possible, convert
 into a den of thieves the temple of the Holy 
 Ghost, - the patient's spiritual power to resuscitate himself. The unchristian practitioner is not giving to mind 
 or body the joy and strength of Truth. The poor suffering heart needs its rightful nutriment, such as peace,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_366"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 366</font></a></p><p></p><p>patience in tribulation, and a priceless sense of the dear
 Father's loving-kindness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Moral evils to be cast out</font></p>
 In order to cure his patient, the metaphysician
 must first cast moral evils out of himself and thus
 attain the spiritual freedom which will enable him to cast physical evils out of his
 patient; but heal he cannot, while his own spiritual
 barrenness debars him from giving drink to the thirsty
 and hinders him from reaching his patient's thought, yea, while mental penury chills his faith and understanding.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The true physician</font></p>
 The physician who lacks sympathy for his fellowbeing is deficient in human affection, and we have the
 apostolic warrant for asking: "He that loveth
 not his brother whom he hath seen, how can
 he love God whom he hath not seen?" Not having this
 spiritual affection, the physician lacks faith in the divine
 Mind and has not that recognition of infinite Love which
 alone confers the healing power. Such so-called Scientists will strain out gnats, while they swallow the camels
 of bigoted pedantry.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Source of calmness</font></p>
 The physician must also watch, lest he be overwhelmed by a sense of the odiousness of sin and by the
 unveiling of sin in his own thoughts. The
 sick are terrified by their sick beliefs, and
 sinners should be affrighted by their sinful beliefs; but
 the Christian Scientist will be calm in the presence of
 both sin and disease, knowing, as he does, that Life is
 God and God is All.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Genuine healing</font></p>
 If we would open their prison doors for the sick, we
 must first learn to bind up the broken-hearted. If we
 would heal by the Spirit, we must not hide the talent
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_367"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 367</font></a></p><p></p><p>of spiritual healing under the napkin of its form, nor 
 bury the morale of Christian Science in the grave-clothes
 of its letter. The tender word and Christian 
 encouragement of an invalid, pitiful patience 
 with his fears and the removal of them, are better than
 hecatombs of gushing theories, stereotyped borrowed  
 speeches, and the doling of arguments, which are but so
 many parodies on legitimate Christian Science, aflame
 with divine Love.   
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Gratitude and humility  </font></p>
 This is what is meant by seeking Truth, Christ, not
 "for the loaves and fishes," nor, like the Pharisee, with
 the arrogance of rank and display of scholarship, but like Mary Magdalene, from the summit of devout consecration, with the oil of gladness and
 the perfume of gratitude, with tears of repentance and 
 with those hairs all numbered by the Father.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The salt of the earth</font></p>
 A Christian Scientist occupies the place at this period
 of which Jesus spoke to his disciples, when he said: "Ye 
 are the salt of the earth." "Ye are the light 
 of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid." Let us watch, work, and pray that this salt 
 lose not its saltness, and that this light be not hid, but
 radiate and glow into noontide glory.
 <p></p><p>The infinite Truth of the Christ-cure has come to this 
 age through a "still, small voice," through silent utterances and divine anointing which quicken and increase
 the beneficial effects of Christianity. I long to see the 
 consummation of my hope, namely, the student's higher
 attainments in this line of light.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Real and counterfeit</font></p>
 Because Truth is infinite, error should be known as 
 nothing. Because Truth is omnipotent in goodness,
 error, Truth's opposite, has no might. Evil is but the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_368%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 368 </font></a></p><p></p><p>counterpoise of nothingness. The greatest wrong is
 but a supposititious opposite of the highest right. The
 confidence inspired by Science lies in the fact
 that Truth is real and error is unreal. Error
 is a coward before Truth. Divine Science insists that
 time will prove all this. Both truth and error have come
 nearer than ever before to the apprehension of mortals,
 and truth will become still clearer as error is selfdestroyed.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Results of faith in Truth</font></p>
 Against the fatal beliefs that error is as real as Truth,
 that evil is equal in power to good if not superior, and that
 discord is as normal as harmony, even the hope
 of freedom from the bondage of sickness and
 sin has little inspiration to nerve endeavor. When we
 come to have more faith in the truth of being than we have
 in error, more faith in Spirit than in matter, more faith
 in living than in dying, more faith in God than in man,
 then no material suppositions can prevent us from healing
 the sick and destroying error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Life independent of matter</font></p>
 That Life is not contingent on bodily conditions is
 proved, when we learn that life and man survive this
 body. Neither evil, disease, nor death can be
 spiritual, and the material belief in them disappears in the ratio of one's spiritual growth. Because
 matter has no consciousness or Ego, it cannot act; its
 conditions are illusions, and these false conditions are the
 source of all seeming sickness. Admit the existence of
 matter, and you admit that mortality (and therefore disease) has a foundation in fact. Deny the existence of
 matter, and you can destroy the belief in material conditions. When fear disappears, the foundation of disease
 is gone. Once let the mental physician believe in the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_369"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 369</font></a></p><p></p><p>reality of matter, and he is liable to admit also the reality 
 of all discordant conditions, and this hinders his destroying them. Thus he is unfitted for the successful 
 treatment of disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man's entity</font></p>
 In proportion as matter loses to human sense all entity as man, in that proportion does man become its 
 master. He enters into a diviner sense of the 
 facts, and comprehends the theology of Jesus 
 as demonstrated in healing the sick, raising the dead, 
 and walking over the wave. All these deeds manifested
 Jesus' control over the belief that matter is substance,
 that it can be the arbiter of life or the constructor of any 
 form of existence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The Christ treatment</font></p>
 We never read that Luke or Paul made a reality of
 disease in order to discover some means of healing it. 
 Jesus never asked if disease were acute or 
 chronic, and he never recommended attention to laws of health, never give drugs, never prayed 
 to know if God were willing that a man should live. He
 understood man, whose life is God, to be immortal, and
 knew that man has not two lives, one to be destroyed and
 the other to be made indestructible.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter not medicine</font></p>
 The prophylactic and therapeutic (that is, the preventive and curative) arts belong emphatically to Christian 
 Science, as would be readily seen, if psychology,
 or the Science of Spirit, God, was understood. 
 Unscientific methods are finding their dead level. Limited to matter by their own law, what have they of the
 advantages of Mind and immortality?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No healing in sin</font></p>
 No man is physically healed in wilful error or by it, 
 any more than he is morally saved in or by sin. It is
 error even to murmur or to be angry over sin. To be
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_370"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 370</font></a></p><p></p><p>every whit whole, man must be better spiritually as well
 as physically. To be immortal, we must forsake the
 mortal sense of things, turn from the lie of false
 belief to Truth, and gather the facts of being
 from the divine Mind. The body improves under the
 same regimen which spiritualizes the thought; and if
 health is not made manifest under this regimen, this
 proves that fear is governing the body. This is the law
 of cause and effect, or like producing like.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Like curing like</font></p>
 Homoeopathy furnishes the evidence to the senses, that
 symptoms, which might be produced by a certain drug,
 are removed by using the same drug which
 might cause the symptoms. This confirms
 my theory that faith in the drug is the sole factor in the
 cure. The effect, which mortal mind produces through
 one belief, it removes through an opposite belief, but it
 uses the same medicine in both cases.
 <p></p><p>The moral and spiritual facts of health, whispered
 into thought, produce very direct and marked effects on
 the body. A physical diagnosis of disease - since mortal mind must be the cause of disease--tends to induce
 disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Transient potency of drugs</font></p>
 According to both medical testimony and individual
 experience, a drug may eventually lose its supposed power
 and do no more for the patient.  Hygienic
 treatment also loses its efficacy. Quackery
 likewise fails at length to inspire the credulity
 of the sick, and then they cease to improve. These lessons are useful. They should naturally and genuinely
 change our basis from sensation to Christian Science,
 from error to Truth, from matter to Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Diagnosis of matter</font></p>
 Physicians examine the pulse, tongue, lungs, to dis<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_371"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 371</font></a></p><p></p><p>cover the condition of matter, when in fact all is 
 Mind. The body is the substratum of mortal mind,
 and this so-called mind must finally yield 
 to the mandate of immortal Mind. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ghost-stories inducing fear </font></p>
 Disquisitions on disease have a mental effect similar
 to that produced on children by telling ghost-stories in 
 the dark. By those uninstructed in Christian 
 Science, nothing is really understood of material 
 existence. Mortals are believed to be here without their 
 consent and to be removed as involuntarily, not knowing
 why nor when. As frightened children look everywhere
 for the imaginary ghost, so sick humanity sees danger in 
 every direction, and looks for relief in all ways except the
 right one. Darkness induces fear. The adult, in bondage to his beliefs, no more comprehends his real being 
 than does the child; and the adult must be taken out of
 his darkness, before he can get rid of the illusive sufferings which throng the gloaming. The way in divine 
 Science is the only way out of this condition.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind imparts purity, health, and beauty</font></p>
 I would not transform the infant at once into a
 man, nor would I keep the suckling a lifelong babe. 
 No impossible thing do I ask when urging 
 the claims of Christian Science; but because 
 this teaching is in advance of the age, we 
 should not deny our need of its spiritual unfoldment.
 Mankind will improve through Science and Christianity. The necessity for uplifting the race is father to 
 the fact that Mind can do it; for Mind can impart
 purity instead of impurity, strength instead of weakness, and health instead of disease. Truth is an alterative in the entire system, and can make it "every whit
 whole."
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_372%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 372 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Brain not intelligent</font></p>
 Remember, brain is not mind. Matter cannot be sick,
 and Mind is immortal. The mortal body is only an erroneous mortal belief of mind in matter. What
 you call matter was originally error in solution, elementary mortal mind,--likened by Milton to
 "chaos and old night." One theory about this mortal
 mind is, that its sensations can reproduce man, can form
 blood, flesh, and bones. The Science of being, in which
 all is divine Mind, or God and His idea, would be clearer
 in this age, but for the belief that matter is the medium
 of man, or that man can enter his own embodied thought,
 bind himself with his own beliefs, and then call his bonds
 material and name them divine law.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Veritable success</font></p>
 When man demonstrates Christian Science absolutely,
 he will be perfect. He can neither sin, suffer, be subject
 to matter, nor disobey the law of God. Therefore he will be as the angels in heaven. Christian Science and Christianity are one. How, then, in
 Christianity any more than in Christian Science, can we
 believe in the reality and power of both Truth and error,
 Spirit and matter, and hope to succeed with contraries?
 Matter is not self-sustaining. Its false supports fail one
 after another. Matter succeeds for a period only by
 falsely parading in the vestments of law.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Recognition of benefits</font></p>
 "Whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also
 deny before my Father which is in heaven." In Christian Science, a denial of Truth is fatal, while
 a just acknowledgment of Truth and of what
 it has done for us is an effectual help. If pride, superstition, or any error prevents the honest recognition of
 benefits received, this will be a hindrance to the recovery
 of the sick and the success of the student.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_373"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 373</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease far more docile than iniquity</font></p>
 If we are Christians on all moral questions, but are in 
 darkness as to the physical exemption which Christianity includes, then we must have more faith
 in God on this subject and be more alive to 
 His promises. It is easier to cure the most 
 malignant disease than it is to cure sin. The author has 
 raised up the dying, partly because they were willing to
 be restored, while she has struggled long, and perhaps in
 vain, to lift a student out of a chronic sin. Under all 
 modes of pathological treatment, the sick recover more
 rapidly from disease than does the sinner from his sin.
 Healing is easier than teaching, if the teaching is faithfully 
 done.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Love frees from fear</font></p>
 The fear of disease and the love of sin are the sources
 of man's enslavement. "The fear of the Lord 
 is the beginning of wisdom," but the Scriptures 
 also declare, through the exalted thought of John, that
 "perfect Love casteth out fear."  
 <p></p><p>The fear occasioned by ignorance can be cured; but
 to remove the effects of fear produced by sin, you must
 rise above both fear and sin. Disease is expressed not 
 so much by the lips as in the functions of the body. Establish the scientific sense of health, and you relieve the
 oppressed organ. The inflammation, decomposition, or 
 deposit will abate, and the disabled organ will resume its
 healthy functions.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind circulates blood</font></p>
 When the blood rushes madly through the veins or 
 languidly creeps along its frozen channels, we call these
 conditions disease. This is a misconception. 
 Mortal mind is producing the propulsion or the 
 languor, and we prove this to be so when by mental means
 the circulation is changed, and returns to that standard
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_374"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 374</font></a></p><p></p><p>which mortal mind has decided upon as essential for
 health. Anodynes, counter-irritants, and depletion never
 reduce inflammation scientifically, but the truth of being,
 whispered into the ear of mortal mind, will bring relief.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind can destroy all ills</font></p>
 Hatred and its effects on the body are removed by
 Love. Because mortal mind seems to be conscious, the
 sick say: "How can my mind cause a disease
 I never thought of and knew nothing about,
 until it appeared on my body?" The author has answered this question in her explanation of disease as originating in human belief before it is consciously apparent
 on the body, which is in fact the objective state of mortal
 mind, though it is called matter. This mortal blindness
 and its sharp consequences show our need of divine metaphysics. Through immortal Mind, or Truth, we can
 destroy all ills which proceed from mortal mind.
 <p></p><p>Ignorance of the cause or approach of disease is no
 argument against the mental origin of disease. You confess to ignorance of the future and incapacity to preserve
 your own existence, and this belief helps rather than
 hinders disease. Such a state of mind induces sickness.
 It is like walking in darkness on the edge of a precipice.
 You cannot forget the belief of danger, and your steps
 are less firm because of your fear, and ignorance of mental
 cause and effect.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Temperature is mental</font></p>
 Heat and cold are products of mortal mind. The body,
 when bereft of mortal mind, at first cools, and afterwards it is resolved into its primitive mortal
 elements. Nothing that lives ever dies, and
 vice versa. Mortal mind produces animal heat, and then
 expels it through the abandonment of a belief, or increases it to the point of self-destruction. Hence it is
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_375"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 375</font></a></p><p></p><p>mortal mind, not matter, which says, "I die."  Heat 
 would pass from the body as painlessly as gas dissipates
 into the air when it evaporates but for the belief that inflammation and pain must accompany the separation of
 heat from the body.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Science versus hypnotism</font></p>
 Chills and heat are often the form in which fever manifests itself. Change the mental state, and the chills and
 fever disappear. The old-school physician 
 proves this when his patient says, " I am better,"  
 but the patient believes that matter, not mind, 
 has helped him. The Christian Scientist demonstrates
 that divine Mind heals, while the hypnotist dispossesses 
 the patient of his individuality in order to control him.
 No person is benefited by yielding his mentality to any
 mental despotism or malpractice. All unscientific mental 
 practice is erroneous and powerless, and should be understood and so rendered fruitless. The genuine Christian
 Scientist is adding to his patient's mental and moral power, 
 and is increasing his patient's spirituality while restoring
 him physically through divine Love.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Cure for palsy</font></p>
 Palsy is a belief that matter governs mortals, and can 
 paralyze the body, making certain portions of 
 it motionless. Destroy the belief, show mortal 
 mind that muscles have no power to be lost, for Mind is 
 supreme, and you cure the palsy.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Latent fear diagnosed</font></p>
 Consumptive patients always show great hopefulness and courage, even when they are supposed to be in 
 hopeless danger. This state of mind seems
 anomalous except to the expert in Christian 
 Science. This mental state is not understood, simply 
 because it is a stage of fear so excessive that it amounts
 to fortitude. The belief in consumption presents to mor<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_376"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 376</font></a></p><p></p><p>tal thought a hopeless state, an image more terrifying than
 that of most other diseases. The patient turns involuntarily from the contemplation of it, but though unacknowledged, the latent fear and the despair of recovery remain
 in thought.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Insidious concepts</font></p>
 Just so is it with the greatest sin. It is the most subtle,
 and does its work almost self-deceived. The diseases
 deemed dangerous sometimes come from the
 most hidden, undefined, and insidious beliefs.
 The pallid invalid, whom you declare to be wasting away
 with consumption of the blood, should be told that blood
 never gave life and can never take it away,--that Life is
 Spirit, and that there is more life and immortality in one
 good motive and act, than in all the blood which ever
 flowed through mortal veins and simulated a corporeal
 sense of life.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Remedy for fever</font></p>
 If the body is material, it cannot, for that very reason,
 suffer with a fever. Because the so-called material body
 is a mental concept and governed by mortal
 mind, it manifests only what that so-called
 mind expresses. Therefore the efficient remedy is to
 destroy the patient's false belief by both silently and audibly arguing the true facts in regard to harmonious
 being,--representing man as healthy instead of diseased,
 and showing that it is impossible for matter to suffer, to
 feel pain or heat, to be thirsty or sick. Destroy fear,
 and you end fever. Some people, mistaught as to Mindscience, inquire when it will be safe to check a fever.
 Know that in Science you cannot check a fever after admitting that it must have its course. To fear and admit
 the power of disease, is to paralyze mental and scientific
 demonstration.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_377"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 377</font></a></p><p></p><p>If your patient believes in taking cold, mentally convince him that matter cannot take cold, and that thought
 governs this liability. If grief causes suffering, convince 
 the sufferer that affliction is often the source of joy, and
 that he should rejoice always in ever-present Love.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Climate harmless</font></p>
 Invalids flee to tropical climates in order to save their 
 lives, but they come back no better than when they went
 away. Then is the time to cure them through 
 Christian Science, and prove that they can 
 be healthy in all climates, when their fear of climate is
 exterminated.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind governs body</font></p>
 Through different states of mind, the body becomes 
 suddenly weak or abnormally strong, showing mortal
 mind to be the producer of strength or weakness. A sudden joy or grief has caused what  
 is termed instantaneous death. Because a belief originates unseen, the mental state should be continually
 watched that it may not produce blindly its bad effects. 
 The author never knew a patient who did not recover
 when the belief of the disease had gone. Remove the
 leading error or governing fear of this lower so-called mind, 
 and you remove the cause of all disease as well as the morbid or excited action of any organ. You also remove in
 this way what are termed organic diseases as readily as 
 functional difficulties.
 <p></p><p>The cause of all so-called disease is mental, a mortal
 fear, a mistaken belief or conviction of the necessity and 
 power of ill-health; also a fear that Mind is helpless to
 defend the life of man and incompetent to control it. Without this ignorant human belief, any circumstance is of itself powerless to produce suffering. It is latent belief in
 disease, as well as the fear of disease, which associates sick</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_378"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 378</font></a></p><p></p><p>ness with certain circumstances and causes the two to
 appear conjoined, even as poetry and music are reproduced in union by human memory. Disease has no intelligence. Unwittingly you sentence yourself to suffer.
 The understanding of this will enable you to commute this
 self-sentence, and meet every circumstance with truth.
 Disease is less than mind, and Mind can control it.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Latent power</font></p>
 Without the so-called human mind, there can be no
 inflammatory nor torpid action of the system. Remove
 the error, and you destroy its effects.  By
 looking a tiger fearlessly in the eye, Sir Charles
 Napier sent it cowering back into the jungle.  An animal may infuriate another by looking it in the eye, and
 both will fight for nothing. A man's gaze, fastened
 fearlessly on a ferocious beast, often causes the beast to
 retreat in terror. This latter occurrence represents the
 power of Truth over error,--the might of intelligence
 exercised over mortal beliefs to destroy them; whereas
 hypnotism and hygienic drilling and drugging, adopted
 to cure matter, is represented by two material erroneous
 bases.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease powerless</font></p>
 Disease is not an intelligence to dispute the empire of
 Mind or to dethrone Mind and take the government into
 its own hands. Sickness is not a God-given,
 nor a self-constituted material power, which
 copes astutely with Mind and finally conquers it. God
 never endowed matter with power to disable Life or to
 chill harmony with a long and cold night of discord.
 Such a power, without the divine permission, is inconceivable; and if such a power could be divinely directed,
 it would manifest less wisdom than we usually find displayed in human governments.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_379"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 379</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jurisdiction of Mind</font></p>
 If disease can attack and control the body without 
 the consent of mortals, sin can do the same, for both
 are errors, announced as partners in the beginning. The Christian Scientist finds only
 effects, where the ordinary physician looks for causes.
 The real jurisdiction of the world is in Mind, controlling 
 every effect and recognizing all causation as vested in
 divine Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Power of imagination</font></p>
 A felon, on whom certain English students experimented, fancied himself bleeding to death, and died because of that belief, when only a stream of 
 warm water was trickling over his arm. Had 
 he known his sense of bleeding was an illusion, he would
 have risen above the false belief. Let the despairing invalid, inspecting the hue of her blood on a cambric handkerchief, think of the experiment of those Oxford boys,
 who caused the death of a man, when not a drop of his
 blood was shed. Then let her learn the opposite statement of life as taught in Christian Science, and she will
 understand that she is not dying on account of the state of
 her blood, but is suffering from her belief that blood is
 destroying her life. The so-called vital current does not
 affect the invalid's health, but her belief produces the
 very results she dreads.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fevers the effect of fear   </font></p>
 Fevers are errors of various types. The quickened
 pulse, coated tongue, febrile heat, dry skin, pain in the
 head and limbs, are pictures drawn on the
 body by a mortal mind. The images, held in
 this disturbed mind, frighten conscious thought. Unless
 the fever-picture, drawn by millions of mortals and imaged on the body through the belief that mind is in matter
 and discord is as real as harmony, is destroyed through
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_380"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 380</font></a></p><p></p><p>Science, it may rest at length on some receptive thought,
 and become a fever case, which ends in a belief called
 death, which belief must be finally conquered by eternal
 Life. Truth is always the victor. Sickness and sin fall
 by their own weight. Truth is the rock of ages, the headstone of the corner, "but on whomsoever it shall fall, it
 will grind him to powder."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Misdirected contention</font></p>
 Contending for the evidence or indulging the demands
 of sin, disease, or death, we virtually contend against
 the control of Mind over body, and deny the
 power of Mind to heal. This false method
 is as though the defendant should argue for the plaintiff
 in favor of a decision which the defendant knows will
 be turned against himself.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Benefits of metaphysics</font></p>
 The physical effects of fear illustrate its illusion. Gazing at a chained lion, crouched for a spring, should not
 terrify a man. The body is affected only with
 the belief of disease produced by a so-called
 mind ignorant of the truth which chains disease. Nothing but the power of Truth can prevent the fear of
 error, and prove man's dominion over error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A higher discovery</font></p>
 Many years ago the author made a spiritual discovery, the scientific evidence of which has accumulated to
 prove that the divine Mind produces in man
 health, harmony, and immortality. Gradually this evidence will gather momentum and clearness,
 until it reaches its culmination of scientific statement and
 proof. Nothing is more disheartening than to believe
 that there is a power opposite to God, or good, and that
 God endows this opposing power with strength to be used
 against Himself, against Life, health, harmony.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ignorance of our rights</font></p>
 Every law of matter or the body, supposed to govern
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_381"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 381</font></a></p><p></p><p>man, is rendered null and void by the law of Life, God. 
 Ignorant of our God-given rights, we submit to unjust
 decrees, and the bias of education enforces 
 this slavery. Be no more willing to suffer the 
 illusion that you are sick or that some disease is developing in the system, than you are to yield to a sinful temptation on the ground that sin has its necessities.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No laws of matter</font></p>
 When infringing some supposed law, you say that
 there is danger. This fear is the danger and induces the 
 physical effects. We cannot in reality suffer 
 from breaking anything except a moral or
 spiritual law. The so-called laws of mortal belief are 
 destroyed by the understanding that Soul is immortal,
 and that mortal mind cannot legislate the times, periods,
 and types of disease, with which mortals die. God is the 
 lawmaker, but He is not the author of barbarous codes.
 In infinite Life and Love there is no sickness, sin, nor
 death, and the Scriptures declare that we live, move, and 
 have our being in the infinite God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God-given dominion</font></p>
 Think less of the enactments of mortal mind, and you
 will sooner grasp man's God-given dominion. You must 
 understand your way out of human theories 
 relating to health, or you will never believe 
 that you are quite free from some ailment. The harmony and immortality of man will never be reached
 without the understanding that Mind is not in matter.
 Let us banish sickness as an outlaw, and abide by the 
 rule of perpetual harmony,--God's law. It is man's
 moral right to annul an unjust sentence, a sentence never
 inflicted by divine authority. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Begin rightly   </font></p>
 Christ Jesus overruled the error which would impose
 penalties for transgressions of the physical laws of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_382"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 382</font></a></p><p></p><p>health; he annulled supposed laws of matter, opposed
 to the harmonies of Spirit, lacking divine authority and having only human approval for
 their sanction.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Hygiene excessive</font></p>
 If half the attention given to hygiene were given to the
 study of Christian Science and to the spiritualization of
 thought, this alone would usher in the milleninium. Constant bathing and rubbing to alter
 the secretions or to remove unhealthy exhalations from
 the cuticle receive a useful rebuke from Jesus' precept,
 "Take no thought . . . for the body." We must beware
 of making clean merely the outside of the platter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Blissful ignorance</font></p>
 He, who is ignorant of what is termed hygienic law, is
 more receptive of spiritual power and of faith in one
 God, than is the devotee of supposed hygienic
 law, who comes to teach the so-called ignorant one. Must we not then consider the so-called law
 of matter a canon "more honored in the breach than
 the observance"? A patient thoroughly booked in medical theories is more difficult to heal through Mind than
 one who is not. This verifies the saying of our Master:
 "Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a
 little child, shall in no wise enter therein."
 <p></p><p>One whom I rescued from seeming spiritual oblivion,
 in which the senses had engulfed him, wrote to me: "I
 should have died, but for the glorious Principle you teach,
 - supporting the power of Mind over the body and showing me the nothingness of the so-called pleasures and pains
 of sense. The treatises I had read and the medicines I
 had taken only abandoned me to more hopeless suffering
 and despair. Adherence to hygiene was useless. Mortal
 mind needed to be set right. The ailment was not bodily,
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_383"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 383</font></a></p><p></p><p>but mental, and I was cured when I learned my way in 
 Christian Science."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A clean mind and body</font></p>
 We need a clean body and a clean mind,--a body 
 rendered pure by Mind as well as washed by water.
 One says: "I take good care of my body." 
 To do this, the pure and exalting influence of 
 the divine Mind on the body is requisite, and the Christian
 Scientist takes the best care of his body when he leaves
 it most out of his thought, and, like the Apostle Paul, is 
 "willing rather to be absent from the body, and to be present with the Lord."
 <p></p><p>A hint may be taken from the emigrant, whose filth
 does not affect his happiness, because mind and body
 rest on the same basis. To the mind equally gross, dirt
 gives no uneasiness. It is the native element of such a
 mind, which is symbolized, and not chafed, by its surroundings; but impurity and uncleanliness, which do
 not trouble the gross, could not be borne by the refined.
 This shows that the mind must be clean to keep the body
 in proper condition.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Beliefs illusive</font></p>
 The tobacco-user, eating or smoking poison for half a
 century, sometimes tells you that the weed preserves
 his health, but does this make it so? Does his
 assertion prove the use of tobacco to be a salubrious habit, and man to be the better for it? Such instances only prove the illusive physical effect of a false
 belief, confirming the Scriptural conclusion concerning a 
 man, "As he thinketh in his heart, so is he."
 <p></p><p>The movement-cure--pinching and pounding the poor
 body, to make it sensibly well when it ought to be insensibly so--is another medical mistake, resulting from
 the common notion that health depends on inert matter
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_384"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 384</font></a></p><p></p><p>instead of on Mind. Can matter, or what is termed
 matter, either feel or act without mind?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Corporeal penalties</font></p>
 We should relieve our minds from the depressing thought
 that we have transgressed a material law and must of
 necessity pay the penalty. Let us reassure
 ourselves with the law of Love. God never
 punishes man for doing right, for honest labor, or for
 deeds of kindness, though they expose him to fatigue,
 cold, heat, contagion. If man seems to incur the penalty
 through matter, this is but a belief of mortal mind, not
 an enactment of wisdom, and man has only to enter his
 protest against this belief in order to annul it. Through
 this action of thought and its results upon the body, the
 student will prove to himself, by small beginnings, the
 grand verities of Christian Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Not matter, but Mind</font></p>
 If exposure to a draught of air while in a state of
 perspiration is followed by chills, dry cough, influenza,
 congestive symptoms in the lungs, or hints of
 inflammatory rheumatism, your Mind-remedy
 is safe and sure. If you are a Christian Scientist, such
 symptoms are not apt to follow exposure; but if you
 believe in laws of matter and their fatal effects when
 transgressed, you are not fit to conduct your own case or
 to destroy the bad effects of your belief. When the fear
 subsides and the conviction abides that you have broken
 no law, neither rheumatism, consumption, nor any other
 disease will ever result from exposure to the weather. In
 Science this is an established fact which all the evidence
 before the senses can never overrule.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Benefit of philanthropy</font></p>
 Sickness, sin, and death must at length quail before
 the divine rights of intelligence, and then the power
 of Mind over the entire functions and organs of the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_385"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 385</font></a></p><p></p><p>human system will be acknowledged. It is proverbial
 that Florence Nightingale and other philanthropists engaged in humane labors have been able to
 undergo without sinking fatigues and exposures which ordinary people could not endure. The explanation lies in the support which they derived from 
 the divine law, rising above the human. The spiritual
 demand, quelling the material, supplies energy and endurance surpassing all other aids, and forestalls the 
 penalty which our beliefs would attach to our best
 deeds. Let us remember that the eternal law of right,
 though it can never annul the law which makes sin its
 own executioner, exempts man from all penalties but
 those due for wrong-doing.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Honest toil has no penalty</font></p>
 Constant toil, deprivations, exposures, and all untoward conditions, if without sin, can be experienced without suffering. Whatever it is your duty to do,
 you can do without harm to yourself. If you 
 sprain the muscles or wound the flesh, your 
 remedy is at hand. Mind decides whether or not the
 flesh shall be discolored, painful, swollen, and inflamed.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Our sleep and food</font></p>
 You say that you have not slept well or have overeaten.
 You are a law unto yourself. Saying this and believing
 it, you will suffer in proportion to your belief 
 and fear. Your sufferings are not the penalty
 for having broken a law of matter, for it is a law of mortal
 mind which you have disobeyed. You say or think, because you have partaken of salt fish, that you must be
 thirsty, and you are thirsty accordingly, while the opposite belief would produce the opposite result.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Doubtful evidence</font></p>
 Any supposed information, coming from the body or
 from inert matter as if either were intelligent, is an illu<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_386"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 386</font></a></p><p></p><p>sion of mortal mind,--one of its dreams. Realize that
 the evidence of the senses is not to be accepted
 in the case of sickness, any more than it is in
 the case of sin.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Climate and belief</font></p>
 Expose the body to certain temperatures, and belief
 says that you may catch cold and have catarrh; but no
 such result occurs without mind to demand
 it and produce it. So long as mortals declare
 that certain states of the atmosphere produce catarrh,
 fever, rheumatism, or consumption, those effects will
 follow,--not because of the climate, but on account of
 the belief. The author has in too many instances healed
 disease through the action of Truth on the minds of mortals, and the corresponding effects of Truth on the body,
 not to know that this is so.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Erroneous despatch</font></p>
 A blundering despatch, mistakenly announcing the
 death of a friend, occasions the same grief that the friend's
 real death would bring. You think that your
 anguish is occasioned by your loss. Another
 despatch, correcting the mistake, heals your grief, and
 you learn that your suffering was merely the result of
 your belief. Thus it is with all sorrow, sickness, and
 death. You will learn at length that there is no cause
 for grief, and divine wisdom will then be understood.
 Error, not Truth, produces all the suffering on earth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mourning causeless</font></p>
 If a Christian Scientist had said, while you were laboring under the influence of the belief of grief, "Your sorrow is without cause," you would not have
 understood him, although the correctness of
 the assertion might afterwards be proved to you. So,
 when our friends pass from our sight and we lament,
 that lamentation is needless and causeless. We shall
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_387"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 387</font></a></p><p></p><p>perceive this to be true when we grow into the understanding of Life, and know that there is no death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind heals brain-disease</font></p>
 Because mortal mind is kept active, must it pay the 
 penalty in a softened brain? Who dares to say that actual
 Mind can be overworked? When we reach 
 our limits of mental endurance, we conclude 
 that intellectual labor has been carried sufficiently far;
 but when we realize that immortal Mind is ever active,
 and that spiritual energies can neither wear out nor can 
 so-called material law trespass upon God-given powers
 and resources, we are able to rest in Truth, refreshed by
 the assurances of immortality, opposed to mortality. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Right never punishable </font></p>
 Our thinkers do not die early because they faithfully
 perform the natural functions of being. If printers and
 authors have the shortest span of earthly existence, it is not because they occupy the most 
 important posts and perform the most vital functions in
 society. That man does not pay the severest penalty 
 who does the most good. By adhering to the realities of
 eternal existence,--instead of reading disquisitions on
 the inconsistent supposition that death comes in obedience 
 to the law of life, and that God punishes man for doing
 good,--one cannot suffer as the result of any labor of
 love, but grows stronger because of it. It is a law of socalled mortal mind, misnamed matter, which causes all
 things discordant.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christian history</font></p>
 The history of Christianity furnishes sublime proofs 
 of the supporting influence and protecting power bestowed
 on man by his heavenly Father, omnipotent 
 Mind, who gives man faith and understanding 
 whereby to defend himself, not only from temptation, but
 from bodily suffering.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_388"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 388</font></a></p><p></p><p>The Christian martyrs were prophets of Christian
 Science. Through the uplifting and consecrating power
 of divine Truth, they obtained a victory over the corporeal senses, a victory which Science alone can explain.
 Stolidity, which is a resisting state of mortal mind, suffers
 less, only because it knows less of material law.
 </p><p></p><p>The Apostle John testified to the divine basis of Christian Science, when dire inflictions failed to destroy his
 body. Idolaters, believing in more than one mind, had
 "gods many," and thought that they could kill the body
 with matter, independently of mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sustenance spiritual</font></p>
 Admit the common hypothesis that food is the nutriment of life, and the follows the necessity for another
 admission in the opposite direction,--that
 food has power to destroy Life, God, through
 a deficiency or an excess, a quality or a quantity. This
 is a specimen of the ambiguous nature of all material
 health-theories. They are self-contradictory and self-destructive, constituting a "kingdom divided against itself,"
 which is "brought to desolation." If food was prepared
 by Jesus for his disciples, it cannot destroy life.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God sustains man</font></p>
 The fact is, food does not affect the absolute Life of
 man, and this becomes self-evident, when we learn that
 God is our Life. Because sin and sickness are
 not qualities of Soul, or Life, we have hope in
 immortality; but it would be foolish to venture beyond
 our present understanding, foolish to stop eating until
 we gain perfection and a clear comprehension of the living
 Spirit. In that perfect day of understanding, we shall
 neither eat to live nor live to eat.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Diet and digestion</font></p>
 If mortals think that food disturbs the harmonious
 functions of mind and body, either the food or this thought
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_389"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 389</font></a></p><p></p><p>must be dispensed with, for the penalty is coupled with 
 the belief. Which shall it be? If this decision be left
 to Christian Science, it will be given in behalf 
 of the control of Mind over this belief and every 
 erroneous belief, or material condition. The less we
 know or think about hygiene, the less we are predisposed 
 to sickness. Recollect that it is not the nerves, not matter, but mortal mind, which reports food as undigested.
 Matter does not inform you of bodily derangements; it 
 is supposed to do so. This pseudo-mental testimony can
 be destroyed only by the better results of Mind's opposite evidence. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scripture rebukes</font></p>
 Our dietetic theories first admit that food sustains the
 life of man, and then discuss the certainty that food can
 kill man. This false reasoning is rebuked in 
 Scripture by the metaphors about the fount 
 and stream, the tree and its fruit, and the kingdom divided against itself. If God has, as prevalent theories 
 maintain, instituted laws that food shall support human
 life, He cannot annul these regulations by an opposite
 law that food shall be inimical to existence. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ancient confusion</font></p>
 Materialists contradict their own statements. Their
 belief in material laws and in penalties for their infraction is the ancient error that there is fraternity 
 between pain and pleasure, good and evil, God 
 and Satan. This belief totters to its falling before the
 battle-axe of Science. 
 <p></p><p>A case of convulsions, produced by indigestion, came
 under my observation. In her belief the woman had
 chronic liver-complaint, and was then suffering from a 
 complication of symptoms connected with this belief. I
 cured her in a few minutes. One instant she spoke de</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_390"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 390</font></a></p><p></p><p>spairingly of herself. The next minute she said, "My
 food is all digested, and I should like something more
 to eat."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ultimate harmony</font></p>
 We cannot deny that Life is self-sustained, and we
 should never deny the everlasting harmony of Soul, simply because, to the mortal senses, there is seeming discord. It is our ignorance of God, the
 divine Principle, which produces apparent discord, and
 the right understanding of Him restores harmony. Truth
 will at length compel us all to exchange the pleasures and
 pains of sense for the joys of Soul.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unnecessary prostration</font></p>
 When the first symptoms of disease appear, dispute the
 testimony of the material senses with divine Science. Let
 your higher sense of justice destroy the false
 process of mortal opinions which you name
 law, and then you will not be confined to a sick-room nor
 laid upon a bed of suffering in payment of the last farthing, the last penalty demanded by error. "Agree with
 thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way with
 him." Suffer no claim of sin or of sickness to grow upon
 the thought. Dismiss it with an abiding conviction that
 it is illegitimate, because you know that God is no more
 the author of sickness than He is of sin. You have no
 law of His to support the necessity either of sin or sickness, but you have divine authority for denying that necessity and healing the sick.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Treatment of disease</font></p>
 "Agree to disagree" with approaching symptoms of
 chronic or acute disease, whether it is cancer, consumption, or smallpox. Meet the incipient stages
 of disease with as powerful mental opposition as a legislator would employ to defeat the passage of
 an inhuman law. Rise in the conscious strength of the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_391"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 391</font></a></p><p></p><p>spirit of Truth to overthrow the plea of mortal mind,
 alias matter, arrayed against the supremacy of Spirit.
 Blot out the images of mortal thought and its beliefs in 
 sickness and sin. Then, when thou art delivered to the
 judgment of Truth, Christ, the judge will say, "Thou
 art whole!" 
 </p><p></p><p><font size="1">Righteous rebellion</font></p>
 Instead of blind and calm submission to the incipient
 or advanced stages of disease, rise in rebellion against
 them. Banish the belief that you can possibly entertain a single intruding pain which cannot be ruled out by the might of Mind, and in this way
 you can prevent the development of pain in the body. 
 No law of God hinders this result. It is error to suffer
 for aught but your own sins. Christ, or Truth, will destroy all other supposed suffering, and real suffering for 
 your own sins will cease in proportion as the sin ceases.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Contradict error</font></p>
 Justice is the moral signification of law. Injustice declares the absence of law. When the body is supposed
 to say, "I am sick," never plead guilty. Since 
 matter cannot talk, it must be mortal mind
 which speaks; therefore meet the intimation with a protest. If you say, "I am sick," you plead guilty. Then
 your adversary will deliver you to the judge (mortal
 mind), and the judge will sentence you. Disease has 
 no intelligence to declare itself something and announce
 its name. Mortal mind alone sentences itself. Therefore
 make your own terms with sickness, and be just to yourself 
 and to others.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sin to be overcome</font></p>
 Mentally contradict every complaint from the body,
 and rise to the true consciousness of Life as 
 Love,--as all that is pure, and bearing the 
 fruits of Spirit. Fear is the fountain of sickness,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_392"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 392</font></a></p><p></p><p>and you master fear and sin through divine Mind; hence
 it is through divine Mind that you overcome disease.
 Only while fear or sin remains can it bring forth death.
 To cure a bodily ailment, every broken moral law should
 be taken into account and the error be rebuked. Fear,
 which is an element of all disease, must be cast out to
 readjust the balance for God. Casting out evil and fear
 enables truth to outweigh error. The only course is to
 take antagonistic grounds against all that is opposed to
 the health, holiness, and harmony of man, God's image.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Illusions about nerves</font></p>
 The physical affirmation of disease should always be
 met with the mental negation. Whatever benefit is produced on the body, must be expressed mentally, and thought should be held fast to this
 ideal. If you believe in inflamed and weak nerves, you
 are liable to an attack from that source. You will call it
 neuralgia, but we call it a belief. If you think that consumption is hereditary in your family, you are liable to
 the development of that thought in the form of what is
 termed pulmonary disease, unless Science shows you
 otherwise. If you decide that climate or atmosphere is
 unhealthy, it will be so to you. Your decisions will master you, whichever direction they take.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Guarding the door</font></p>
 Reverse the case. Stand porter at the door of thought.
 Admitting only such conclusions as you wish realized in
 bodily results, you will control yourself harmoniously. When the condition is present
 which you say induces disease, whether it be air, exercise,
 heredity, contagion, or accident, then perform your office
 as porter and shut out these unhealthy thoughts and fears.
 Exclude from mortal mind the offending errors; then the
 body cannot suffer from them. The issues of pain or
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_393"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 393</font></a></p><p></p><p>pleasure must come through mind, and like a watchman
 forsaking his post, we admit the intruding belief, forgetting that through divine help we can forbid this entrance.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The strength of Spirit</font></p>
 The body seems to be self-acting, only because mortal
 mind is ignorant of itself, of its own actions, and of their
 results, - ignorant that the predisposing, remote, and exciting cause of all bad effects is a 
 law of so-called mortal mind, not of matter. Mind is the
 master of the corporeal senses, and can conquer sickness,
 sin, and death. Exercise this God-given authority. Take
 possession of your body, and govern its feeling and action.
 Rise in the strength of Spirit to resist all that is unlike
 good. God has made man capable of this, and nothing
 can vitiate the ability and power divinely bestowed on
 man. 
 <p></p><p><font size="1">No pain in matter</font></p>
 Be firm in your understanding that the divine Mind
 governs, and that in Science man reflects God's government. Have no fear that matter can ache, 
 swell, and be inflamed as the result of a law 
 of any kind, when it is self-evident that matter can have
 no pain nor inflammation. Your body would suffer no 
 more from tension or wounds than the trunk of a tree
 which you gash or the electric wire which you stretch,
 were it not for mortal mind. 
 <p></p><p>When Jesus declares that "the light of the body is the
 eye," he certainly means that light depends upon Mind,
 not upon the complex humors, lenses, muscles, the iris 
 and pupil, constituting the visual organism.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No real disease</font></p>
 Man is never sick, for Mind is not sick and matter
 cannot be. A false belief is both the tempter 
 and the tempted, the sin and the sinner, the 
 disease and its cause. It is well to be calm in sickness;
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_394"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 394</font></a></p><p></p><p>to be hopeful is still better; but to understand that sickness is not real and that Truth can destroy its seeming
 reality, is best of all, for this understanding is the universal and perfect remedy.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Recuperation mental</font></p>
 By conceding power to discord, a large majority of
 doctors depress mental energy, which is the only real
 recuperative power. Knowledge that we
 can accomplish the good we hope for, stimulates the system to act in the direction which Mind points
 out. The admission that any bodily condition is beyond
 the control of Mind disarms man, prevents him from
 helping himself, and enthrones matter through error. To
 those struggling with sickness, such admissions are discouraging,--as much so as would be the advice to a man
 who is down in the world, that he should not try to rise
 above his difficulties.
 <p></p><p>Experience has proved to the author the fallacy of
 material systems in general,--that their theories are
 sometimes pernicious, and that their denials are better
 than their affirmations. Will you bid a man let evils
 overcome him, assuring him that all misfortunes are from
 God, against whom mortals should not contend? Will
 you tell the sick that their condition is hopeless, unless it
 can be aided by a drug or climate? Are material means
 the only refuge from fatal chances? Is there no divine
 permission to conquer discord of every kind with harmony,
 with Truth and Love?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Arguing wrongly</font></p>
 We should remember that Life is God, and that God
 is omnipotent. Not understanding Christian
 Science, the sick usually have little faith in
 it till they feel its beneficent influence. This shows
 that faith is not the healer in such cases. The sick
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_395"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 395</font></a></p><p></p><p>unconsciously argue for suffering, instead of against it.
 They admit its reality, whereas they should deny it.
 They should plead in opposition to the testimony of the
 deceitful senses, and maintain man's immortality and
 eternal likeness to God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine authority</font></p>
 Like the great Exemplar, the healer should speak to 
 disease as one having authority over it, leaving Soul to
 master the false evidences of the corporeal
 senses and to assert its claims over mortality and disease. The same Principle cures both sin and
 sickness. When divine Science overcomes faith in a carnal mind, and faith in God destroys all faith in sin and in
 material methods of healing, then sin, disease, and death
 will disappear.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Aids in sickness</font></p>
 Prayers, in which God is not asked to heal but is besought to take the patient to Himself, do not benefit the
 sick. An ill-tempered, complaining, or deceitful person should not be a nurse. The nurse 
 should be cheerful, orderly, punctual, patient, full of
 faith,--receptive to Truth and Love.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental quackery</font></p>
 It is mental quackery to make disease a reality--to 
 hold it as something seen and felt--and then to attempt
 its cure through Mind. It is no less erroneous 
 to believe in the real existence of a tumor, a 
 cancer, or decayed lungs, while you argue against their
 reality, than it is for your patient to feel these ills in
 physical belief. Mental practice, which holds disease
 as a reality, fastens disease on the patient, and it may
 appear in a more alarming form.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Effacing images of disease</font></p>
 The knowledge that brain-lobes cannot kill a man nor 
 affect the functions of mind would prevent the brain from
 becoming diseased, though a moral offence is indeed the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_396"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 396</font></a></p><p></p><p>worst of diseases. One should never hold in mind
 the thought of disease, but should efface from
 thought all forms and types of disease, both for
 one's own sake and for that of the patient.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Avoid talking disease</font></p>
 Avoid talking illness to the patient. Make no unnecessary inquiries relative to feelings or disease. Never
 startle with a discouraging remark about recovery, nor draw attention to certain symptoms as unfavorable, avoid speaking aloud the name of
 the disease. Never say beforehand how much you have
 to contend with in a case, nor encourage in the patient's
 thought the expectation of growing worse before a crisis
 is passed.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">False testimony refuted</font></p>
 The refutation of the testimony of material sense is
 not a difficult task in view of the conceded falsity of this
 testimony. The refutation becomes arduous,
 not because the testimony of sin or disease is
 true, but solely on account of the tenacity of belief in its
 truth, due to the force of education and the overwhelming weight of opinions on the wrong side,--all teaching
 that the body suffers, as if matter could have sensation.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Healthful explanation</font></p>
 At the right time explain to the sick the power which
 their beliefs exercise over their bodies. Give them divine
 and wholesome understanding, with which to
 combat their erroneous sense, and so efface the
 images of sickness from mortal mind. Keep distinctly in
 thought that man is the offspring of God, not of man;
 that man is spiritual, not material; that Soul is Spirit,
 outside of matter, never in it, never giving the body life
 and sensation. It breaks the dream of disease to understand that sickness is formed by the human mind, not by
 matter nor by the divine Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_397"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 397</font></a></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Misleading methods</font></p>
 By not perceiving vital metaphysical points, not seeing
 how mortal mind affects the body,--acting beneficially
 or injuriously on the health, as well as on the 
 morals and the happiness of mortals,--we are 
 misled in our conclusions and methods. We throw the
 mental influence on the wrong side, thereby actually injuring those whom we mean to bless.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Remedy for accidents</font></p>
 Suffering is no less a mental condition than is enjoyment. You cause bodily sufferings and increase them
 by admitting their reality and continuance,
 as directly as you enhance your joys by believing them to be real and continuous. When an accident happens, you think or exclaim, "I am hurt!"
 Your thought is more powerful than your words, more
 powerful than the accident itself, to make the injury
 real.
 <p></p><p>Now reverse the process. Declare that you are not hurt
 and understand the reason why, and you will find the
 ensuing good effects to be in exact proportion to your
 disbelief in physics, and your fidelity to divine metaphysics, confidence in God as All, which the Scriptures
 declare Him to be.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Independent mentality</font></p>
 To heal the sick, one must be familiar with the great
 verities of being. Mortals are no more material in their
 waking hours than when they act, walk, see, 
 hear, enjoy, or suffer in dreams. We can 
 never treat mortal mind and matter separately, because
 they combine as one. Give up the belief that mind
 is, even temporarily, compressed within the skull, and
 you will quickly become more manly or womanly. You
 will understand yourself and your Maker better than
 before.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_398"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 398</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Naming maladies</font></p>
 Sometimes Jesus called a disease by name, as when he
 said to the epileptic boy, "Thou dumb and deaf spirit, I
 charge thee, come out of him, and enter no
 more into him." It is added that "the spirit
 [error] cried, and rent him sore and came out of him, and
 he was as one dead,"--clear evidence that the malady
 was not material. These instances show the concessions
 which Jesus was willing to make to the popular ignorance
 of spiritual Life-laws. Often he gave no name to the
 distemper he cured. To the synagogue ruler's daughter,
 whom they called dead but of whom he said, "she is not
 dead, but sleepeth," he simply said, "Damsel, I say unto
 thee, arise!" To the sufferer with the withered hand
 he said, "Stretch forth thine hand," and it "was restored
 whole, like as the other."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The action of faith</font></p>
 Homoeopathic remedies, sometimes not containing a
 particle of medicine, are known to relieve the symptoms
 of disease. What produces the change? It is
 the faith of the doctor and the patient, which
 reduces self-inflicted sufferings and produces a new effect
 upon the body. In like manner destroy the illusion of
 pleasure in intoxication, and the desire for strong drink
 is gone. Appetite and disease reside in mortal mind, not
 in matter.
 <p></p><p>So also faith, cooperating with a belief in the healing
 effects of time and medication, will soothe fear and change
 the belief of disease to a belief of health. Even a blind
 faith removes bodily ailments for a season, but hypnotism
 changes such ills into new and more difficult forms of disease. The Science of Mind must come to the rescue,
 to work a radical cure. Then we understand the process.
 The great fact remains that evil is not mind. Evil has
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_399"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 399</font></a></p><p></p><p>no power, no intelligence, for God is good, and therefore
 good is infinite, is All.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Corporeal combinations</font></p>
 You say that certain material combinations produce
 disease; but if the material body causes disease, can
 matter cure what matter has caused? Mortal 
 mind prescribes the drug, and administers it. 
 Mortal mind plans the exercise, and puts the body through
 certain motions. No gastric gas accumulates, not a secretion nor combination can operate, apart from the
 action of mortal thought, alias mortal mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Automatic mechanism</font></p>
 So-called mortal mind sends its despatches over its
 body, but this so-called mind is both the service and 
 message of this telegraphy. Nerves are unable to talk, and matter can return no answer to immortal Mind. If Mind is the only actor, how 
 can mechanism be automatic? Mortal mind perpetuates
 its own thought. It constructs a machine, manages it,
 and then calls it material. A mill at work or the action 
 of a water-wheel is but a derivative from, and continuation of, the primitive mortal mind. Without this force
 the body is devoid of action, and this deadness shows 
 that so-called mortal life is mortal mind, not matter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental strength</font></p>
 Scientifically speaking, there is no mortal mind out of
 which to make material beliefs, springing from illusion. 
 This misnamed mind is not an entity. It is 
 only a false sense of matter, since matter is not 
 sensible. The one Mind, God, contains no mortal opinions. All that is real is included in this immortal Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Confirmation in a parable</font></p>
 Our Master asked: "How can one enter into a strong
 man's house and spoil his goods, except he first 
 bind the strong man?" In other words: How 
 can I heal the body, without beginning with so-called
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_400"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 400</font></a></p><p></p><p>mortal mind, which directly controls the body? When
 disease is once destroyed in this so-called mind, the fear
 of disease is gone, and therefore the disease is thoroughly cured. Mortal mind is "the strong man," which
 must be held in subjection before its influence upon health
 and morals can be removed. This error conquered, we
 can despoil "the strong man" of his goods,--namely, of
 sin and disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Eradicate error from thought</font></p>
 Mortals obtain the harmony of health, only as they
 forsake discord, acknowledge the supremacy of divine
 Mind, and abandon their material beliefs.
 Eradicate the image of disease from the perturbed thought before it has taken tangible
 shape in conscious thought, alias the body, and you prevent the development of disease. This task becomes easy,
 if you understand that every disease is an error, and has
 no character nor type, except what mortal mind assigns to
 it. By lifting thought above error, or disease, and contending persistently for truth, you destroy error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal mind controlled</font></p>
 When we remove disease by addressing the disturbed
 mind, giving no heed to the body, we prove that thought
 alone creates the suffering. Mortal mind
 rules all that is mortal. We see in the body
 the images of this mind, even as in optics we see painted
 on the retina the image which becomes visible to the
 senses. The action of so-called mortal mind must be
 destroyed by the divine Mind to bring out the harmony
 of being. Without divine control there is discord, manifest as sin, sickness, and death.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal mind not a healer</font></p>
 The Scriptures plainly declare the baneful influence of
 sinful thought on the body. Even our Master felt this.
 It is recorded that in certain localities he did not many
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_401"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 401</font></a></p><p></p><p>mighty works "because of their unbelief" in Truth. Any 
 human error is its own enemy, and works against itself;
 it does nothing in the right direction and much 
 in the wrong. If so-called mind is cherishing 
 evil passions and malicious purposes, it is not a healer,
 but it engenders disease and death. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Effect of opposites   </font></p>
 If faith in the truth of being, which you impart mentally while destroying error, causes chemicalization (as
 when an alkali is destroying an acid), it is because the truth of being must transform the 
 error to the end of producing a higher manifestation.
 This fermentation should not aggravate the disease, but 
 should be as painless to man as to a fluid, since matter
 has no sensation and mortal mind only feels and sees
 materially.   
    
 What I term chemicalization is the upheaval produced
 when immortal Truth is destroying erroneous mortal belief. Mental chemicalization brings sin and sickness to 
 the surface, forcing impurities to pass away, as is the case
 with a fermenting fluid.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Medicine and brain</font></p>
 The only effect produced by medicine is dependent upon 
 mental action. If the mind were parted from the body,
 could you produce any effect upon the brain 
 or body by applying the drug to either? Would 
 the drug remove paralysis, affect organization, or restore
 will and action to cerebrum and cerebellum?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Skilful surgery</font></p>
 Until the advancing age admits the efficacy and supremacy of Mind, it is better for Christian Scientists to leave
 surgery and the adjustment of broken bones 
 and dislocations to the fingers of a surgeon, 
 while the mental healer confines himself chiefly to mental
 reconstruction and to the prevention of inflammation.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_402"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 402</font></a></p><p></p><p>Christian Science is always the most skilful surgeon, but
 surgery is the branch of its healing which will be last
 acknowledged. However, it is but just to say that the
 author has already in her possession well-authenticated
 records of the cure, by herself and her students through
 mental surgery alone, of broken bones, dislocated joints,
 and spinal vertebrae.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Indestructible life of man</font></p>
 The time approaches when mortal mind will forsake
 its corporeal, structural, and material basis, when immortal Mind and its formations will be apprehended in Science, and material beliefs will
 not interfere with spiritual facts. Man is indestructible
 and eternal. Sometime it will be learned that mortal
 mind constructs the mortal body with this mind's own
 mortal materials. In Science, no breakage nor dislocation
 can really occur. You say that accidents, injuries, and
 disease kill man, but this is not true. The life of man is
 Mind. The material body manifests only what mortal
 mind believes, whether it be a broken bone, disease, or sin.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The evil of mesmerism</font></p>
 We say that one human mind can influence another and
 in this way affect the body, but we rarely remember that
 we govern our own bodies. The error, mesmerism--or hypnotism, to use the recent term
 - illustrates the fact just stated. The operator would
 make his subjects believe that they cannot act voluntarily
 and handle themselves as they should do. If they yield
 to this influence, it is because their belief is not better
 instructed by spiritual understanding. Hence the proof
 that hypnotism is not scientific; Science cannot produce
 both disorder and order. The involuntary pleasure or
 pain of the person under hypnotic control is proved to be
 a belief without a real cause.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_403"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 403</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Wrong-doer should suffer</font></p>
 So the sick through their beliefs have induced their own 
 diseased conditions. The great difference between voluntary and involuntary mesmerism is that voluntary mesmerism is induced consciously and 
 should and does cause the perpetrator to suffer, while selfmesmerism is induced unconsciously and by his mistake 
 a man is often instructed. In the first instance it is understood that the difficulty is a mental illusion, while in the
 second it is believed that the misfortune is a material effect. 
 The human mind is employed to remove the illusion in
 one case, but matter is appealed to in the other. In reality, both have their origin in the human mind, and can be 
 healed only by the divine Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error's power imaginary</font></p>
 You command the situation if you understand that
 mortal existence is a state of self-deception and not the 
 truth of being. Mortal mind is constantly 
 producing on mortal body the results of false
 opinions; and it will continue to do so, until mortal 
 error is deprived of its imaginary powers by Truth,
 which sweeps away the gossamer web of mortal illusion.
 The most Christian state is one of rectitude and spiritual understanding, and this is best adapted for healing the sick. Never conjure up some new discovery from
 dark forebodings regarding disease and then acquaint
 your patient with it.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease-production</font></p>
 The mortal so-called mind produces all that is unlike
 the immortal Mind. The human mind determines the
 nature of a case, and the practitioner improves 
 or injures the case in proportion to the truth 
 or error which influences his conclusions. The mental 
 conception and development of disease are not understood by the patient, but the physician should be familiar
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_404"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 404</font></a></p><p></p><p>with mental action and its effect in order to judge the case
 according to Christian Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Appetites to be abandoned</font></p>
 If a man is an inebriate, a slave to tobacco, or the special
 servant of any one of the myriad forms of sin, meet and
 destroy these errors with the truth of being, by exhibiting to the wrong-doer the suffering
 which his submission to such habits brings, and by convincing him that there is no real pleasure in false appetites. A corrupt mind is manifested in a corrupt body.
 Lust, malice, and all sorts of evil are diseased beliefs, and
 you can destroy them only by destroying the wicked
 motives which produce them. If the evil is over in the
 repentant mortal mind, while its effects still remain on the
 individual, you can remove this disorder as God's law is
 fulfilled and reformation cancels the crime. The healthy
 sinner is the hardened sinner.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Temperance reform</font></p>
 The temperance reform, felt all over our land, results
 from metaphysical healing, which cuts down every tree
 that brings not forth good fruit. This conviction, that there is no real pleasure in sin,
 is one of the most important points in the theology of
 Christian Science. Arouse the sinner to this new and
 true view of sin, show him that sin confers no pleasure,
 and this knowledge strengthens his moral courage and
 increases his ability to master evil and to love good.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sin or fear the root of sickness</font></p>
 Healing the sick and reforming the sinner are one and
 the same thing in Christian Science. Both cures require
 the same method and are inseparable in Truth.
 Hatred, envy, dishonesty, fear, and so forth,
 make a man sick, and neither material medicine nor Mind can help him permanently, even in body,
 unless it makes him better mentally, and so delivers him
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_405"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 405</font></a></p><p></p><p>from his destroyers. The basic error is mortal mind. 
 Hatred inflames the brutal propensities. The indulgence
 of evil motives and aims makes any man, who is above the 
 lowest type of manhood, a hopeless sufferer.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental conspirators</font></p>
 Christian Science commands man to master the propensities,--to hold hatred in abeyance with kindness,
 to conquer lust with chastity, revenge with 
 charity, and to overcome deceit with honesty. Choke these errors in their early stages, if you 
 would not cherish an army of conspirators against
 health, happiness, and success. They will deliver you
 to the judge, the arbiter of truth against error. The 
 judge will deliver you to justice, and the sentence of
 the moral law will be executed upon mortal mind and
 body. Both will be manacled until the last farthing 
 is paid,--until you have balanced your account with
 God. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also
 reap." The good man finally can overcome his fear of 
 sin. This is sin's necessity, - to destroy itself. Immortal man demonstrates the government of God, good,
 in which is no power to sin.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Cumulative repentence  </font></p>
 It were better to be exposed to every plague on earth
 than to endure the cumulative effects of a guilty conscience. The abiding consciousness of wrongdoing tends to destroy the ability to do right.
 If sin is not regretted and is not lessening, then it is
 hastening on to physical and moral doom. You are conquered by the moral penalties you incur and the ills they
 bring. The pains of sinful sense are less harmful than its
 pleasures. Belief in material suffering causes mortals to 
 retreat from their error, to flee from body to Spirit, and
 to appeal to divine sources outside of themselves.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_406"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 406</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The leaves of healing</font></p>
 The Bible contains the recipe for all healing. "The
 leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations."
 Sin and sickness are both healed by the same
 Principle. The tree is typical of man's divine
 Principle, which is equal to every emergency, offering
 full salvation from sin, sickness, and death. Sin will
 submit to Christian Science when, in place of modes and
 forms, the power of God is understood and demonstrated
 in the healing of mortals, both mind and body. "Perfect Love casteth out fear."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sickness will abate</font></p>
 The Science of being unveils the errors of sense, and
 spiritual perception, aided by Science, reaches Truth.
 Then error disappears. Sin and sickness will
 abate and seem less real as we approach the
 scientific period, in which mortal sense is subdued and
 all that is unlike the true likeness disappears. The moral
 man has no fear that he will commit a murder, and he
 should be as fearless on the question of disease.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Resist to the end</font></p>
 Resist evil--error of every sort--and it will flee from
 you. Error is opposed to Life. We can, and ultimately
 shall, so rise as to avail ourselves in every direction of the supremacy of Truth over error, Life
 over death, and good over evil, and this growth will go
 on until we arrive at the fulness of God's idea, and no
 more fear that we shall be sick and die. Inharmony of
 any kind involves weakness and suffering,--a loss of
 control over the body.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Morbid cravings</font></p>
 The depraved appetite for alcoholic drinks, tobacco,
 tea, coffee, opium, is destroyed only by Mind's mastery
 of the body. This normal control is gained
 through divine strength and understanding.
 There is no enjoyment in getting drunk, in becoming a
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_407"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 407</font></a></p><p></p><p>fool or an object of loathing; but there is a very sharp 
 remembrance of it, a suffering inconceivably terrible to
 man's self-respect. Puffing the obnoxious fumes of tobacco, or chewing a leaf naturally attractive to no creature except a loathsome worm, is at least disgusting.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Universal panacea</font></p>
 Man's enslavement to the most relentless masters passion, selfishness, envy, hatred, and revenge - is conquered only by a mighty struggle. Every 
 hour of delay makes the struggle more severe. 
 If man is not victorious over the passions, they crush
 out happiness, health, and manhood. Here Christian
 Science is the sovereign panacea, giving strength to the 
 weakness of mortal mind,--strength from the immortal
 and omnipotent Mind,--and lifting humanity above
 itself into purer desires, even into spiritual power and 
 good-will to man.
 <p></p><p>Let the slave of wrong desire learn the lessons of Christian Science, and he will get the better of that desire 
 and ascend a degree in the scale of health, happiness,
 and existence.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Immortal memory</font></p>
 If delusion says, "I have lost my memory," contradict it. No faculty of Mind is lost. In Science, all
 being is eternal, spiritual, perfect, harmonious in every action. Let the perfect model be 
 present in your thoughts instead of its demoralized opposite. This spiritualization of thought lets in the light,
 and brings the divine Mind, Life not death, into your 
 consciousness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sin a form of insanity</font></p>
 There are many species of insanity. All sin is insanity in different degrees. Sin is spared from 
 this classification, only because its method of
 madness is in consonance with common mortal belief.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_408"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 408</font></a></p><p></p><p>Every sort of sickness is error,--that is, sickness is 
 loss of harmony. This view is not altered by the fact
 that sin is worse than sickness, and sickness is not acknowledged nor discovered to be error by many who are
 sick.
 </p><p></p><p>There is a universal insanity of so-called health, which
 mistakes fable for fact throughout the entire round of the
 material senses, but this general craze cannot, in a scientific diagnosis, shield the individual case from the special
 name of insanity. Those unfortunate people who are
 committed to insane asylums are only so many distinctly
 defined instances of the baneful effects of illusion on mortal minds and bodies.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Drugs and brain-lobes</font></p>
 The supposition that we can correct insanity by the use
 of purgatives and narcotics is in itself a mild species of
 insanity. Can drugs go of their own accord
 to the brain and destroy the so-called inflammation of disordered functions, thus reaching mortal
 mind through matter? Drugs do not affect a corpse, and
 Truth does not distribute drugs through the blood, and
 from them derive a supposed effect on intelligence and sentiment. A dislocation of the tarsal joint would produce
 insanity as perceptibly as would congestion of the brain,
 were it not that mortal mind thinks that the tarsal joint is
 less intimately connected with the mind than is the brain.
 Reverse the belief, and the results would be perceptibly
 different.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter and animate error</font></p>
 The unconscious thought in the corporeal substratum of brain produces no effect, and that condition of
 the body which we call sensation in matter
 is unreal. Mortal mind is ignorant of itself,--ignorant of the errors it includes and of their
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_409"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 409</font></a></p><p></p><p>effects. Intelligent matter is an impossibility. You 
 may say: "But if disease obtains in matter, why do
 you insist that disease is formed by mortal mind and 
 not by matter?" Mortal mind and body combine as
 one, and the nearer matter approaches its final statement,--animate error called nerves, brain, mind,--the 
 more prolific it is likely to become in sin and diseasebeliefs.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Dictation of error</font></p>
 Unconscious mortal mind - alias matter, brain - cannot dictate terms to consciousness nor say, "I am sick."
 The belief, that the unconscious substratum 
 of mortal mind, termed the body, suffers and 
 reports disease independently of this so-called conscious
 mind, is the error which prevents mortals from knowing
 how to govern their bodies. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">So-called superiority   </font></p>
 The so-called conscious mortal mind is believed to be
 superior to its unconscious substratum, matter, and
 the stronger never yields to the weaker, except through fear or choice. The animate 
 should be governed by God alone. The real man is
 spiritual and immortal, but the mortal and imperfect 
 so-called "children of men" are counterfeits from the
 beginning, to be laid aside for the pure reality. This
 mortal is put off, and the new man or real man is put
 on, in proportion as mortals realize the Science of man
 and seek the true model.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Death no benefactor</font></p>
 We have no right to say that life depends on matter 
 now, but will not depend on it after death. We cannot
 spend our days here in ignorance of the Science
 of Life, and expect to find beyond the grave 
 a reward for this ignorance. Death will not make us
 harmonious and immortal as a recompense for ignorance.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_410"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 410</font></a></p><p></p><p>If here we give no heed to Christian Science, which is
 spiritual and eternal, we shall not be ready for spiritual
 Life hereafter.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Life eternal and present</font></p>
 "This is life eternal," says Jesus,--is, not shall be;
 and then he defines everlasting life as a present knowledge
 of his Father and of himself,--the knowledge
 of Love, Truth, and Life. "This is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God, and
 Jesus Christ, whom Thou hast sent." The Scriptures
 say, "Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every
 word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God," showing that Truth is the actual life of man; but mankind
 objects to making this teaching practical.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Love casteth out fear</font></p>
 Every trial of our faith in God makes us stronger.
 The more difficult seems the material condition to be
 overcome by Spirit, the stronger should be our
 faith and the purer our love. The Apostle
 John says: "There is no fear in Love, but perfect Love
 casteth out fear. . . . He that feareth is not made perfect in Love." Here is a definite and inspired proclamation of Christian Science.
 <p></p><center>MENTAL TREATMENT ILLUSTRATED</center>
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Be not afraid</font></p>
 The Science of mental practice is susceptible of no
 misuse. Selfishness does not appear in the practice of
 Truth or Christian Science. If mental practice is abused or is used in any way except to
 promote right thinking and doing, the power to heal
 mentally will diminish, until the practitioner's healing
 ability is wholly lost. Christian scientific practice begins with Christ's keynote of harmony, "Be not afraid!"
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_411"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 411</font></a></p><p></p><p>Said Job: "The thing which I greatly feared is come 
 upon me."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Naming diseases</font></p>
 My first discovery in the student's practice was this:
 If the student silently called the disease by name, when
 he argued against it, as a general rule the body
 would respond more quickly, - just as a person replies more readily when his name is spoken; but
 this was because the student was not perfectly attuned to
 divine Science, and needed the arguments of truth for 
 reminders. If Spirit or the power of divine Love bear
 witness to the truth, this is the ultimatum, the scientific
 way, and the healing is instantaneous.   
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evils cast out</font></p>
 It is recorded that once Jesus asked the name of a disease,--a disease which moderns would call dementia.
 The demon, or evil, replied that his name was 
 Legion. Thereupon Jesus cast out the evil, 
 and the insane man was changed and straightway became whole. The Scripture seems to import that Jesus 
 caused the evil to be self-seen and so destroyed.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fear as the foundation</font></p>
 The procuring cause and foundation of all sickness is
 fear, ignorance, or sin. Disease is always induced by a 
 false sense mentally entertained, not destroyed.
 Disease is an image of thought externalized. 
 The mental state is called a material state. Whatever 
 is cherished in mortal mind as the physical condition is
 imaged forth on the body.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unspoken pleading</font></p>
 Always begin your treatment by allaying the fear 
 of patients. Silently reassure them as to their exemption from disease and danger. Watch the result of this simple rule of Christian Science, 
 and you will find that it alleviates the symptoms of every
 disease. If you succeed in wholly removing the fear,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_412"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 412</font></a></p><p></p><p>your patient is healed. The great fact that God lovingly
 governs all, never punishing aught but sin, is your standpoint, from which to advance and destroy the human fear
 of sickness. Mentally and silently plead the case scientifically for Truth. You may vary the arguments to meet
 the peculiar or general symptoms of the case you treat,
 but be thoroughly persuaded in your own mind concerning the truth which you think or speak, and you will be
 the victor.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Eloquent silence</font></p>
 You may call the disease by name when you mentally
 deny it; but by naming it audibly, you are liable under
 some circumstances to impress it upon the
 thought. The power of Christian Science and
 divine Love is omnipotent. It is indeed adequate to unclasp the hold and to destroy disease, sin, and death.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Insistence requisite</font></p>
 To prevent disease or to cure it, the power of Truth,
 of divine Spirit, must break the dream of the material
 senses. To heal by argument, find the type
 of the ailment, get its name, and array your
 mental plea against the physical. Argue at first mentally, not audibly, that the patient has no disease, and
 conform the argument so as to destroy the evidence of
 disease. Mentally insist that harmony is the fact, and
 that sickness is a temporal dream. Realize the presence
 of health and the fact of harmonious being, until the
 body corresponds with the normal conditions of health
 and harmony.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The cure of infants</font></p>
 If the case is that of a young child or an infant, it needs
 to be met mainly through the parent's thought, silently
 or audibly on the aforesaid basis of Christian
 Science. The Scientist knows that there can
 be no hereditary disease, since matter is not intelligent
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_413"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 413</font></a></p><p></p><p>and cannot transmit good or evil intelligence to man, and 
 God, the only Mind, does not produce pain in matter.
 The act of yielding one's thoughts to the undue contemplation of physical wants or conditions induces those very
 conditions. A single requirement, beyond what is necessary to meet the simplest needs of the babe is harmful. 
 Mind regulates the condition of the stomach, bowels, and
 food, the temperature of children and of men, and matter
 does not. The wise or unwise views of parents and other 
 persons on these subjects produce good or bad effects on
 the health of children.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ablutions for cleanliness</font></p>
 The daily ablutions of an infant are no more natural 
 nor necessary than would be the process of taking a fish
 out of water every day and covering it with dirt
 in order to make it thrive more vigorously in its 
 own element. "Cleanliness is next to godliness," but
 washing should be only for the purpose of keeping the
 body clean, and this can be effected without scrubbing the 
 whole surface daily. Water is not the natural habitat of
 humanity. I insist on bodily cleanliness within and without. I am not patient with a speck of dirt; but in caring 
 for an infant one need not wash his little body all over each
 day in order to keep it sweet as the new-blown flower.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Juvenile ailments</font></p>
 Giving drugs to infants, noticing every symptom of 
 flatulency, and constantly directing the mind to such
 signs,--that mind being laden with illusions 
 about disease, health-laws, and death,--these 
 actions convey mental images to children's budding
 thoughts, and often stamp them there, making it probable
 at any time that such ills may be reproduced in the very 
 ailments feared. A child may have worms, if you say so,
 or any other malady, timorously held in the beliefs con<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_414"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 414</font></a></p><p></p><p> cerning his body. Thus are laid the foundations of the
 belief in disease and death, and thus are children educated
 into discord.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Cure of insanity</font></p>
 The treatment of insanity is especially interesting.
 However obstinate the case, it yields more readily than
 do most diseases to the salutary action of
 truth, which counteracts error. The arguments to be used in curing insanity are the same as in
 other diseases: namely, the impossibility that matter,
 brain, can control or derange mind, can suffer or cause
 suffering; also the fact that truth and love will establish
 a healthy state, guide and govern mortal mind or the
 thought of the patient, and destroy all error, whether it is
 called dementia, hatred, or any other discord.
 <p></p><p>To fix truth steadfastly in your patients' thoughts, explain Christian Science to them, but not too soon,--not
 until your patients are prepared for the explanation, lest you array the sick against their own interests by troubling and perplexing their thought. The Christian Scientist's argument rests on the Christianly scientific basis of
 being. The Scripture declares, "The Lord He is God
 [good]; there is none else beside Him." Even so, harmony
 is universal, and discord is unreal. Christian Science declares that Mind is substance, also that matter neither
 feels, suffers, nor enjoys. Hold these points strongly in
 view. Keep in mind the verity of being,--that man is
 the image and likeness of God, in whom all being is
 painless and permanent. Remember that man's perfection is real and unimpeachable, whereas imperfection is
 blameworthy, unreal, and is not brought about by divine
 Love.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter is not inflamed</font></p>
 Matter cannot be inflamed. Inflammation is fear, an
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_415"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 415</font></a></p><p></p><p>excited state of mortals which is not normal. Immortal Mind is the only cause; therefore disease is neither a
 cause nor an effect. Mind in every case is the
 eternal God, good. Sin, disease, and death 
 have no foundations in Truth. Inflamation as a mortal belief quickens or impedes the action of the system, 
 because thought moves quickly or slowly, leaps or halts
 when it contemplates unpleasant things, or when the individual looks upon some object which he dreads. Inflammation never appears in a part which mortal thought
 does not reach. That is why opiates relieve inflammation.
 They quiet the thought by inducing stupefaction and by
 resorting to matter instead of to Mind. Opiates do not
 remove the pain in any scientific sense. They only render mortal mind temporarily less fearful, till it can master 
 an erroneous belief.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth calms the thought</font></p>
 Note how thought makes the face pallid. It either retards the circulation or quickens it, causing a pale or 
 flushed cheek. In the same way thought increases or diminishes the secretions, the action
 of the lungs, of the bowels, and of the heart. The muscles, moving quickly or slowly and impelled or palsied by
 thought, represent the action of all the organs of the human system, including brain and viscera. To remove 
 the error producing disorder, you must calm and instruct
 mortal mind with immortal Truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Effects of etherization</font></p>
 Etherization will apparently cause the body to disappear. Before the thoughts are fully at rest, the limbs
 will vanish from consciousness. Indeed, the 
 whole frame will sink from sight along with 
 surrounding objects, leaving the pain standing forth as
 distinctly as a mountain-peak, as if it were a separate
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_416"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 416</font></a></p><p></p><p>bodily member. At last the agony also vanishes. This
 process shows the pain to be in the mind, for the inflammation is not suppressed; and the belief of pain will
 presently return, unless the mental image occasioning
 the pain be removed by recognizing the truth of being.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sedatives valueless</font></p>
 A hypodermic injection of morphine is administered
 to a patient, and in twenty minutes the sufferer is quietly asleep. To him there is no longer any
 pain. Yet any physician - allopathic, homoeopathic, botanic, eclectic - will tell you that the troublesome material cause is unremoved, and that when the
 soporific influence of the opium is exhausted, the patient will find himself in the same pain, unless the belief
 which occasions the pain has meanwhile been changed.
 Where is the pain while the patient sleeps?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The so-called physical ego</font></p>
 The material body, which you call me, is mortal mind,
 and this mind is material in sensation, even as the body,
 which has originated from this material sense
 and been developed according to it, is material. This materialism of parent and child is only in
 mortal mind, as the dead body proves; for when the
 mortal has resigned his body to dust, the body is no
 longer the parent, even in appearance.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evil thought depletes</font></p>
 The sick know nothing of the mental process by
 which they are depleted, and next to nothing of the
 metaphysical method by which they can be
 healed. If they ask about their disease, tell
 them only what is best for them to know. Assure them
 that they think too much about their ailments, and
 have already heard too much on that subject.  Turn
 their thoughts away from their bodies to higher objects. Teach them that their being is sustained by
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_417"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 417</font></a></p><p></p><p>Spirit, not by matter, and that they find health, peace,
 and harmony in God, divine Love.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Helpful encouragement</font></p>
 Give sick people credit for sometimes knowing more
 than their doctors. Always support their trust in the
 power of Mind to sustain the body. Never 
 tell the sick that they have more courage 
 than strength. Tell them rather, that their strength
 is in proportion to their courage. If you make the sick
 realize this great truism, there will be no reaction from 
 over-exertion or from excited conditions. Maintain
 the facts of Christian Science,--that Spirit is God, and
 therefore cannot be sick; that what is termed matter 
 cannot be sick; that all causation is Mind, acting
 through spiritual law. Then hold your ground with
 the unshaken understanding of Truth and Love, and 
 you will win. When you silence the witness against your
 plea, you destroy the evidence, for the disease disappears. The evidence before the corporeal senses is not 
 the Science of immortal man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease to be made unreal</font></p>
 To the Christian Science healer, sickness is a dream
 from which the patient needs to be awakened.  Disease should not appear real to the physician, 
 since it is demonstrable that the way to 
 cure the patient is to make disease unreal to him. To 
 do this, the physician must understand the unreality
 of disease in Science.
 <p></p><p>Explain audibly to your patients, as soon as they can 
 bear it, the complete control which Mind holds over the
 body. Show them how mortal mind seems to induce
 disease by certain fears and false conclusions, and how 
 divine Mind can cure by opposite thoughts. Give your
 patients an underlying understanding to support them
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_418"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 418</font></a></p><p></p><p>and to shield them from the baneful effects of their own
 conclusions. Show them that the conquest over sickness,
 as well as over sin, depends on mentally destroying all
 belief in material pleasure or pain.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christian pleading</font></p>
 Stick to the truth of being in contradistinction to the
 error that life, substance, or intelligence can be in matter.
 Plead with an honest conviction of truth and
 a clear perception of the unchanging, unerring, and certain effect of divine Science. Then, if your
 fidelity is half equal to the truth of your plea, you will
 heal the sick.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truthful arguments</font></p>
 It must be clear to you that sickness is no more
 the reality of being than is sin. This mortal dream
 of sickness, sin, and death should cease
 through Christian Science. Then one disease would be as readily destroyed as another. Whatever the belief is, if arguments are used to destroy it,
 the belief must be repudiated, and the negation must extend to the supposed disease and to whatever decides its
 type and symptoms. Truth is affirmative, and confers
 harmony. All metaphysical logic is inspired by this simple rule of Truth, which governs all reality. By the
 truthful arguments you employ, and especially by the
 spirit of Truth and Love which you entertain, you will
 heal the sick.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Morality required</font></p>
 Include moral as well as physical belief in your efforts
 to destroy error. Cast out all manner of evil. "Preach
 the gospel to every creature." Speak the
 truth to every form of error. Tumors, ulcers,
 tubercles, inflammation, pain, deformed joints, are waking dream-shadows, dark images of mortal thought, which
 flee before the light of Truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_419"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 419</font></a></p><p></p><p>A moral question may hinder the recovery of the sick. 
 Lurking error, lust, envy, revenge, malice, or hate will
 perpetuate or even create the belief in disease. Errors 
 of all sorts tend in this direction. Your true course is
 to destroy the foe, and leave the field to God, Life, Truth,
 and Love, remembering that God and His ideas alone 
 are real and harmonious.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Relapse unnecessary</font></p>
 If your patient from any cause suffers a relapse, meet
 the cause mentally and courageously, knowing that 
 there can be no reaction in Truth. Neither 
 disease itself, sin, nor fear has the power to 
 cause disease or a relapse. Disease has no intelligence 
 with which to move itself about or to change itself from
 one form to another. If disease moves, mind, not matter, moves it; therefore be sure that you move it off. 
 Meet every adverse circumstance as its master. Observe mind instead of body, lest aught unfit for development enter thought. Think less of material conditions 
 and more of spiritual.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Conquer beliefs and fears</font></p>
 Mind produces all action. If the action proceeds from
 Truth, from immortal Mind, there is harmony; but mortal mind is liable to any phase of belief. A 
 relapse cannot in reality occur in mortals or
 so-called mortal minds, for there is but one 
 Mind, one God. Never fear the mental malpractitioner,
 the mental assassin, who, in attempting to rule mankind,
 tramples upon the divine Principle of metaphysics, for God 
 is the only power. To succeed in healing, you must conquer your own fears as well as those of your patients, and
 rise into higher and holier consciousness. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True government of man </font></p>
 If it is found necessary to treat against relapse, know
 that disease or its symptoms cannot change forms, nor
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_420"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 420</font></a></p><p></p><p>go from one part to another, for Truth destroys disease.
 There is no metastasis, no stoppage of harmonious
 action, no paralysis. Truth not error, Love
 not hate, Spirit not matter, governs man. If
 students do not readily heal themselves, they should
 early call an experienced Christian Scientist to aid
 them. If they are unwilling to do this for themselves,
 they need only to know that error cannot produce this
 unnatural reluctance.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Positive reassurance</font></p>
 Instruct the sick that they are not helpless victims,
 for if they will only accept Truth, they can resist disease
 and ward it off, as positively as they can the
 temptation to sin. This fact of Christian Science should be explained to invalids when they are in a
 fit mood to receive it, - when they will not array themselves against it, but are ready to become receptive to the
 new idea. The fact that Truth overcomes both disease
 and sin reassures depressed hope. It imparts a healthy
 stimulus to the body, and regulates the system. It increases or diminishes the action, as the case may require,
 better than any drug, alterative, or tonic.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Proper stimulus</font></p>
 Mind is the natural stimulus of the body, but erroneous belief, taken at its best, is not promotive of health
 or happiness. Tell the sick that they can
 meet disease fearlessly, if they only realize
 that divine Love gives them all power over every physical
 action and condition.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Awaken the patient</font></p>
 If it becomes necessary to startle mortal mind to break
 its dream of suffering, vehemently tell your patient that
 he must awake. Turn his gaze from the false
 evidence of the senses to the harmonious facts
 of Soul and immortal being. Tell him that he suffers
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_421"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 421</font></a></p><p></p><p>only as the insane suffer, from false beliefs. The only 
 difference is, that insanity implies belief in a diseased
 brain, while physical ailments (so-called) arise from the 
 belief that other portions of the body are deranged. Derangement, or disarrangement, is a word which conveys
 the true definition of all human belief in ill-health, or disturbed harmony. Should you thus startle mortal mind
 in order to remove its beliefs, afterwards make known
 to the patient your motive for this shock, showing him 
 that it was to facilitate recovery.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">How to treat a crisis</font></p>
 If a crisis occurs in your treatment, you must treat
 the patient less for the disease and more for the mental 
 disturbance or fermentation, and subdue the 
 symptoms by removing the belief that this 
 chemicalization produces pain or disease. Insist vehemently on the great fact which covers the whole ground,
 that God, Spirit, is all, and that there is none beside
 Him. There is no disease. When the supposed suffering is gone from mortal mind, there can be no pain; and
 when the fear is destroyed, the inflammation will subside. Calm the excitement sometimes induced by chemicalization, which is the alterative effect produced by
 Truth upon error, and sometimes explain the symptoms
 and their cause to the patient.  
 <p></p><p><font size="1">No perversion of Mind-science  </font></p>
 It is no more Christianly scientific to see disease than
 it is to experience it. If you would destroy the sense
 of disease, you should not build it up by 
 wishing to see the forms it assumes or by 
 employing a single material application for 
 its relief. The perversion of Mind-science is like asserting that the products of eight multiplied by five, and
 of seven by ten, are both forty, and that their combined
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_422"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 422</font></a></p><p></p><p>sum is fifty, and then calling the process mathematics.
 Wiser than his persecutors, Jesus said: "If I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your children cast them
 out?"
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Effect of this book</font></p>
 If the reader of this book observes a great stir throughout his whole system, and certain moral and physical
 symptoms seem aggravated, these indications
 are favorable. Continue to read, and the book
 will become the physician, allaying the tremor which
 Truth often brings to error when destroying it.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Disease neutralized</font></p>
 Patients, unfamiliar with the cause of this commotion
 and ignorant that it is a favorable omen, may be alarmed.
 If such be the case, explain to them the law
 of this action. As when an acid and alkali
 meet and bring out a third quality, so mental and moral
 chemistry changes the material base of thought, giving
 more spirituality to consciousness and causing it to depend
 less on material evidence. These changes which go on
 in mortal mind serve to reconstruct the body. Thus
 Christian Science, by the alchemy of Spirit, destroys sin
 and death.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Bone-healing by surgery</font></p>
 Let us suppose two parallel cases of bone-disease, both
 similarly produced and attended by the same symptoms.
 A surgeon is employed in one case, and a
 Christian Scientist in the other. The surgeon, holding that matter forms its own conditions and
 renders them fatal at certain points, entertains fears and
 doubts as to the ultimate outcome of the injury. Not
 holding the reins of government in his own hands, he
 believes that something stronger than Mind--namely,
 matter--governs the case. His treatment is therefore
 tentative. This mental state invites defeat. The belief
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_423"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 423</font></a></p><p></p><p>that he has met his master in matter and may not be 
 able to mend the bone, increases his fear; yet this belief
 should not be communicated to the patient, either verbally or otherwise, for this fear greatly diminishes the
 tendency towards a favorable result. Remember that the
 unexpressed belief oftentimes affects a sensitive patient 
 more strongly than the expressed thought.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific corrective</font></p>
 The Christian Scientist, understanding scientifically
 that all is Mind, commences with mental causation, the 
 truth of being, to destroy the error. This corrective is an alterative, reaching to every part 
 of the human system. According to Scripture, it searches 
 "the joints and marrow," and it restores the harmony of
 man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Coping with difficulties</font></p>
 The matter-physician deals with matter as both his foe 
 and his remedy. He regards the ailment as weakened or
 strengthened according to the evidence which 
 matter presents. The metaphysician, making 
 Mind his basis of operation irrespective of matter and
 regarding the truth and harmony of being as superior to
 error and discord, has rendered himself strong, instead 
 of weak, to cope with the case; and he proportionately
 strengthens his patient with the stimulus of courage and
 conscious power. Both Science and consciousness are 
 now at work in the economy of being according to the law
 of Mind, which ultimately asserts its absolute supremacy.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Formation from thought</font></p>
 Ossification or any abnormal condition or derangement of the body is as directly the action of mortal
 mind as is dementia or insanity. Bones have 
 only the substance of thought which forms 
 them. They are only phenomena of the mind of mortals. The so-called substance of bone is formed first
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_424"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 424</font></a></p><p></p><p>by the parent's mind, through self-division. Soon the
 child becomes a separate, individualized mortal mind,
 which takes possession of itself and its own thoughts of
 bones.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Accidents unknown to God</font></p>
 Accidents are unknown to God, or immortal Mind,
 and we must leave the mortal basis of belief
 and unite with the one Mind, in order to
 change the notion of chance to the proper sense
 of God's unerring direction and thus bring out harmony.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Opposing mentality</font></p>
 Under divine Providence there can be no accidents,
 since there is no room for imperfection in perfection.
 In medical practice objections would be raised if one
 doctor should administer a drug to counteract the working of a remedy prescribed by another doctor.
 It is equally important in metaphysical practice that the minds which surround your patient should
 not act against your influence by continually expressing
 such opinions as may alarm or discourage,--either by
 giving antagonistic advice or through unspoken thoughts
 resting on your patient. While it is certain that the
 divine Mind can remove any obstacle, still you need the
 ear of your auditor. It is not more difficult to make yourself heard mentally while others are thinking about your
 patients or conversing with them, if you understand
 Christian Science--the oneness and the allness of divine
 Love; but it is well to be alone with God and the sick
 when treating disease.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind removes scrofula</font></p>
 To prevent or to cure scrofula and other so-called hereditary diseases, you must destroy the belief in these ills
 and the faith in the possibility of their transmission. The patient may tell you that he
 has a humor in the blood, a scrofulous diathesis. His
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_425"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 425</font></a></p><p></p><p>parents or some of his progenitors farther back have so 
 believed. Mortal mind, not matter, induces this conclusion and its results. You will have humors, just so 
 long as you believe them to be safety-valves or to be
 ineradicable.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Nothing to consume</font></p>
 If the case to be mentally treated is consumption, take 
 up the leading points included (according to belief) in
 this disease. Show that it is not inherited; 
 that inflammation, tubercles, hemorrhage, and
 decomposition are beliefs, images of mortal thought superimposed upon the body; that they are not the truth
 of man; that they should be treated as error and put out 
 of thought. Then these ills will disappear.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The lungs re-formed</font></p>
 If the body is diseased, this is but one of the beliefs of
 mortal mind. Mortal man will be less mortal, when he 
 learns that matter never sustained existence 
 and can never destroy God, who is man's Life. 
 When this is understood, mankind will be more spiritual 
 and know that there is nothing to consume, since Spirit,
 God, is All-in-all. What if the belief is consumption?
 God is more to a man than his belief, and the less we acknowledge matter or its laws, the more immortality we
 possess. Consciousness constructs a better body when
 faith in matter has been conquered. Correct material 
 belief by spiritual understanding, and Spirit will form
 you anew. You will never fear again except to offend
 God, and you will never believe that heart or any portion of the body can destroy you.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soundness maintained</font></p>
 If you have sound and capacious lungs and want
 them to remain so, be always ready with the 
 mental protest against the opposite belief in 
 heredity. Discard all notions about lungs, tubercles, in<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_426"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 426</font></a></p><p></p><p>herited consumption, or disease arising from any circumstance, and you will find that mortal mind, when
 instructed by Truth, yields to divine power, which steers
 the body into health.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Our footsteps heavenward</font></p>
 The discoverer of Christian Science finds the path less
 difficult when she has the high goal always before her
 thoughts, than when she counts her footsteps
 in endeavoring to reach it. When the destination is desirable, expectation speeds our progress. The
 struggle for Truth makes one strong instead of weak,
 resting instead of wearying one. If the belief in death
 were obliterated, and the understanding obtained that
 there is no death, this would be a "tree of life," known
 by its fruits. Man should renew his energies and endeavors, and see the folly of hypocrisy, while also learning the necessity of working out his own salvation. When
 it is learned that disease cannot destroy life, and that
 mortals are not saved from sin or sickness by death, this
 understanding will quicken into newness of life. It will
 master either a desire to die or a dread of the grave,
 and thus destroy the great fear that besets mortal
 existence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christian standard</font></p>
 The relinquishment of all faith in death and also of
 the fear of its sting would raise the standard of health
 and morals far beyond its present elevation,
 and would enable us to hold the banner of
 Christianity aloft with unflinching faith in God, in Life
 eternal. Sin brought death, and death will disappear
 with the disappearance of sin. Man is immortal, and
 the body cannot die, because matter has no life to surrender. The human concepts named matter, death, disease, sickness, and sin are all that can be destroyed.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_427"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 427</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Life not contingent on matter</font></p>
 If it is true that man lives, this fact can never change 
 in Science to the opposite belief that man dies. Life is
 the law of Soul, even the law of the spirit of 
 Truth, and Soul is never without its representative. Man's individual being can no more 
 die nor disappear in unconsciousness than can Soul, for 
 both are immortal. If man believes in death now, he
 must disbelieve in it when learning that there is no reality
 in death, since the truth of being is deathless. The belief that existence is contingent on matter must be met
 and mastered by Science, before Life can be understood
 and harmony obtained.    
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortality vanquished</font></p>
 Death is but another phase of the dream that existence can be material. Nothing can interfere with the
 harmony of being nor end the existence of 
 man in Science. Man is the same after as 
 before a bone is broken or the body guillotined. If man
 is never to overcome death, why do the Scriptures say, 
 "The last enemy that shall be destroyed is death"? The
 tenor of the Word shows that we shall obtain the victory
 over death in proportion as we overcome sin. The great 
 difficulty lies in ignorance of what God is. God, Life,
 Truth, and Love make man undying. Immortal Mind,
 governing all, must be acknowledged as supreme in the 
 physical realm, so-called, as well as in the spiritual.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No death nor inaction</font></p>
 Called to the bed of death, what material remedy has
 man when all such remedies have failed? Spirit is his 
 last resort, but it should have been his first 
 and only resort. The dream of death must 
 be mastered by Mind here or hereafter. Thought 
 will waken from its own material declaration, "I am
 dead," to catch this trumpet-word of Truth, "There
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_428"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 428</font></a></p><p></p><p>is no death, no inaction, diseased action, overaction, nor
 reaction."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Vision opening</font></p>
 Life is real, and death is the illusion. A demonstration of the facts of Soul in Jesus' way resolves the dark
 visions of material sense into harmony and
 immortality. Man's privilege at this supreme
 moment is to prove the words of our Master: "If a man
 keep my saying, he shall never see death." To divest
 thought of false trusts and material evidences in order
 that the spiritual facts of being may appear,--this is
 the great attainment by means of which we shall sweep
 away the false and give place to the true. Thus we may
 establish in truth the temple, or body, "whose builder
 and maker is God."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Intelligent consecration</font></p>
 We should consecrate existence, not "to the unknown
 God" whom we "ignorantly worship," but to the eternal
 builder, the everlasting Father, to the Life
 which mortal sense cannot impair nor mortal
 belief destroy. We must realize the ability of mental
 might to offset human misconceptions and to replace them
 with the life which is spiritual, not material.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The present immortality</font></p>
 The great spiritual fact must be brought out that man
 is, not shall be, perfect and immortal. We must hold
 forever the consciousness of existence, and
 sooner or later, through Christ and Christian
 Science, we must master sin and death. The evidence
 of man's immortality will become more apparent, as material beliefs are given up and the immortal facts of being
 are admitted.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Careful guidance</font></p>
 The author has healed hopeless organic disease, and
 raised the dying to life and health through the understanding of God as the only Life. It is a sin to believe
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_429"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 429</font></a></p><p></p><p>that aught can overpower omnipotent and eternal Life,
 and this Life must be brought to light by the understanding that there is no death, as well as by other 
 graces of Spirit. We must begin, however, 
 with the more simple demonstrations of control, and
 the sooner we begin the better. The final demonstration
 takes time for its accomplishment. When walking, we
 are guided by the eye. We look before our feet, and if
 we are wise, we look beyond a single step in the line of 
 spiritual advancement.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Clay replying to the potter</font></p>
 The corpse, deserted by thought, is cold and decays,
 but it never suffers. Science declares that man is subject to Mind. Mortal mind affirms that mind 
 is subordinate to the body, that the body is 
 dying, that it must be buried and decomposed 
 into dust; but mortal mind's affirmation is not true.
 Mortals waken from the dream of death with bodies unseen by those who think that they bury the body. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Continuity of existence </font></p>
 If man did not exist before the material organization
 began, he could not exist after the body is disintegrated.
 If we live after death and are immortal, we 
 must have lived before birth, for if Life ever 
 had any beginning, it must also have an ending, even according to the calculations of natural science. Do you 
 believe this? No! Do you understand it? No! This
 is why you doubt the statement and do not demonstrate
 the facts it involves. We must have faith in all the sayings of our Master, though they are not included in the
 teachings of the schools, and are not understood generally by our ethical instructors.   
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Life all-inclusive</font></p>
 Jesus said (John viii. 51), "If a man keep my saying,
 he shall never see death." That statement is not con<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_430"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 430</font></a></p><p></p><p>fined to spiritual life, but includes all the phenomena of
 existence. Jesus demonstrated this, healing the dying
 and raising the dead. Mortal mind must part
 with error, must put off itself with its deeds,
 and immortal manhood, the Christ ideal, will appear.
 Faith should enlarge its borders and strengthen its base
 by resting upon Spirit instead of matter. When man
 gives up his belief in death, he will advance more rapidly
 towards God, Life, and Love. Belief in sickness and
 death, as certainly as belief in sin, tends to shut out the
 true sense of Life and health. When will mankind wake
 to this great fact in Science?
 </p><p></p><p>I here present to my readers an allegory illustrative
 of the law of divine Mind and of the supposed laws of matter and hygiene, an allegory in which the plea of Christian
 Science heals the sick.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A mental court case</font></p>
 Suppose a mental case to be on trial, as cases are tried
 in court. A man is charged with having committed livercomplaint. The patient feels ill, ruminates,
 and the trial commences. Personal Sense is
 the plaintiff. Mortal Man is the defendant. False Belief
 is the attorney for Personal Sense. Mortal Minds, Materia Medica, Anatomy, Physiology, Hypnotism, Envy,
 Greed and Ingratitude, constitute the jury. The courtroom is filled with interested spectators, and Judge
 Medicine is on the bench.
 <p></p><p>The evidence for the prosecution being called for, a
 witness testifies thus: </p><p></p><p>I represent Health-laws. I was present on certain nights
 when the prisoner, or patient, watched with a sick friend.
 Although I have the superintendence of human affairs, I
 was personally abused on those occasions. I was told that
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_431"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 431</font></a></p><p></p><p>I must remain silent until called for at this trial, when I
 would be allowed to testify in the case. Notwithstanding
 my rules to the contrary, the prisoner watched with the sick 
 every night in the week. When the sick mortal was thirsty,
 the prisoner gave him drink. During all this time the prisoner attended to his daily labors, partaking of food at irregular intervals, sometimes going to sleep immediately
 after a heavy meal. At last he committed liver-complaint,
 which I considered criminal, inasmuch as this offence is 
 deemed punishable with death. Therefore I arrested Mortal Man in behalf of the state (namely, the body) and cast
 him into prison.  
    
 At the time of the arrest the prisoner summoned Physiology, Materia Medica, and Hypnotism to prevent his punishment. The struggle on their part was long. Materia 
 Medica held out the longest, but at length all these assistants resigned to me, Health-laws, and I succeeded in getting Mortal Man into close confinement until I should 
 release him.
 </p><p></p><p>The next witness is called:</p><p></p><p>I am Coated Tongue. I am covered with a foul fur, 
 placed on me the night of the liver-attack. Morbid Secretion hypnotized the prisoner and took control of his mind,
 making him despondent. 
     
 Another witness takes the stand and testifies:</p><p></p><p>I am Sallow Skin. I have been dry, hot, and chilled by
 turns since the night of the liver-attack. I have lost my 
 healthy hue and become unsightly, although nothing on my
 part has occasioned this change. I practise daily ablutions
 and perform my functions as usual, but I am robbed of my 
 good looks.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_432"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 432</font></a></p><p></p><p>The next witness testifies: </p><p></p><p>I am Nerve, the State Commissioner for Mortal Man.
 I am intimately acquainted with the plaintiff, Personal
 Sense, and know him to be truthful and upright, whereas
 Mortal Man, the prisoner at the bar, is capable of falsehood. I was witness to the crime of liver-complaint. I
 knew the prisoner would commit it, for I convey messages
 from my residence in matter, alias brain, to body.
 </p><p></p><p>Another witness is called for by the Court of Error
 and says: </p><p></p><p>I am Mortality, Governor of the Province of Body, in
 which Mortal Man resides. In this province there is a statute regarding disease, - namely, that he upon whose person disease is found shall be treated as a criminal and
 punished with death.
 </p><p></p><p>The Judge asks if by doing good to his neighbor, it is
 possible for man to become diseased, transgress the laws,
 and merit punishment, and Governor Mortality replies in
 the affirmative.
 </p><p></p><p>Another witness takes the stand and testifies: </p><p></p><p>I am Death. I was called for, shortly after the report of
 the crime, by the officer of the Board of Health, who protested that the prisoner had abused him, and that my presence was required to confirm his testimony. One of the
 prisoner's friends, Materia Medica, was present when I
 arrived, endeavoring to assist the prisoner to escape from
 the hands of justice, alias nature's so-called law; but my
 appearance with a message from the Board of Health
 changed the purpose of Materia Medica, and he decided at
 once that the prisoner should die.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_433"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 433</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Judge Medicine charges the jury</font></p>
 The testimony for the plaintiff, Personal Sense, being
 closed, Judge Medicine arises, and with great solemnity
 addresses the jury of Mortal Minds. He analyzes the offence, reviews the testimony, and
 explains the law relating to liver-complaint. 
 His conclusion is, that laws of nature render disease 
 homicidal. In compliance with a stern duty, his Honor,
 Judge Medicine, urges the jury not to allow their judgment to be warped by the irrational, unchristian suggestions of Christian Science. The jury must regard in such
 cases only the evidence of Personal Sense against Mortal
 Man.      
 <p></p><p>As the Judge proceeds, the prisoner grows restless. His
 sallow face blanches with fear, and a look of despair and
 death settles upon it. The case is given to the jury. A 
 brief consultation ensues, and the jury returns a verdict
 of "Guilty of liver-complaint in the first degree."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortal Man sentenced</font></p>
 Judge Medicine then proceeds to pronounce the solemn 
 sentence of death upon the prisoner. Because he has
 loved his neighbor as himself, Mortal Man has 
 been guilty of benevolence in the first degree,  
 and this has led him into the commission of the second
 crime, liver-complaint, which material laws condemn as
 homicide. For this crime Mortal Man is sentenced to 
 be tortured until he is dead. "May God have mercy on
 your soul," is the Judge's solemn peroration.
 <p></p><p>The prisoner is then remanded to his cell (sick-bed), 
 and Scholastic Theology is sent for to prepare the frightened sense of Life, God,--which sense must be immortal,
 - for death.     
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Appeal to a higher tribunal</font></p>
 Ah! but Christ, Truth, the spirit of Life and the
 friend of Mortal Man, can open wide those prison doors
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_434"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 434</font></a></p><p></p><p>and set the captive free. Swift on the wings of divine
 Love, there comes a despatch: "Delay the execution;
 the prisoner is not guilty." Consternation fills
 the prison-yard. Some exclaim, "It is contrary to law and justice." Others say,
 "The law of Christ supersedes our laws; let us follow
 Christ."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Counsel for defence</font></p>
 After much debate and opposition, permission is obtained for a trial in the Court of Spirit, where Christian
 Science is allowed to appear as counsel for
 the unfortunate prisoner. Witnesses, judges
 and jurors, who were at the previous Court of Error,
 are now summoned to appear before the bar of Justice
 and eternal Truth.
 <p></p><p>When the case for Mortal Man versus Personal Sense
 is opened, Mortal Man's counsel regards the prisoner
 with the utmost tenderness. The counsel's earnest,
 solemn eyes, kindling with hope and triumph, look upward. Then Christian Science turns suddenly to the
 supreme tribunal, and opens the argument for the
 defence: </p><p></p><p>The prisoner at the bar has been unjustly sentenced.
 His trial was a tragedy, and is morally illegal. Mortal
 Man has had no proper counsel in the case. All the testmony has been on the side of Personal Sense, and we shall
 unearth this foul conspiracy against the liberty and life of
 Man. The only valid testimony in the case shows the
 alleged crime never to have been committed. The prisoner is not proved "worthy of death, or of bonds."
 </p><p></p><p>Your Honor, the lower court has sentenced Mortal Man
 to die, but God made Man immortal and amenable to
 Spirit only. Denying justice to the body, that court com</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_435"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 435</font></a></p><p></p><p>mended man's immortal Spirit to heavenly mercy,--Spirit
 which is God Himself and Man's only lawgiver! Who or
 what has sinned? Has the body or has Mortal Mind
 committed a criminal deed? Counsellor False Belief has
 argued that the body should die, while Reverend Theology
 would console conscious Mortal Mind, which alone is capable of sin and suffering. The body committed no offence.
 Mortal Man, in obedience to higher law, helped his fellowman, an act which should result in good to himself as well 
 as to others.
 </p><p></p><p>The law of our Supreme Court decrees that whosoever
 sinneth shall die; but good deeds are immortal, bringing 
 joy instead of grief, pleasure instead of pain, and life
 instead of death. If liver-complaint was committed by
 trampling on Laws of Health, this was a good deed, for the 
 agent of those laws is an outlaw, a destroyer of Mortal
 Man's liberty and rights. Laws of Health should be sentenced to die.    
   
 Watching beside the couch of pain in the exercise of a
 love that "is the fulfilling of the law,"--doing "unto
 others as ye would that they should do unto you,"--this
 is no infringement of law, for no demand, human or divine,
 renders it just to punish a man for acting justly. If mortals sin, our Supreme Judge in equity decides what penalty
 is due for the sin, and Mortal Man can suffer only for his
 sin. For naught else can he be punished, according to the
 law of Spirit, God.   
   
 Then what jurisdiction had his Honor, Judge Medicine,
 in this case? To him I might say, in Bible language, "Sittest thou to judge . . . after the law, and commandest . . . 
 to be smitten contrary to the law?" The only jurisdiction
 to which the prisoner can submit is that of Truth, Life, and
 Love. If they condemn him not, neither shall Judge Medicine condemn him; and I ask that the prisoner be restored
 to the liberty of which he has been unjustly deprived.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_436"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 436</font></a></p><p></p><p>The principal witness (the officer of the Health-laws)
 deposed that he was an eye-witness to the good deeds for
 which Mortal Man is under sentence of death. After betraying him into the hands of your law, the Health-agent
 disappeared, to reappear however at the trial as a witness
 against Mortal Man and in the interest of Personal Sense,
 a murderer. Your Supreme Court must find the prisoner on the night of the alleged offence to have been acting
 within the limits of the divine law, and in obedience
 thereto. Upon this statute hangs all the law and testimony.
 Giving a cup of cold water in Christ's name, is a Christian
 service. Laying down his life for a good deed, Mortal Man
 should find it again. Such acts bear their own justification, and are under the protection of the Most High.
 </p><p></p><p>Prior to the night of his arrest, the prisoner summoned
 two professed friends, Materia Medica and Physiology, to
 prevent his committing liver-complaint, and thus save him
 from arrest. But they brought with them Fear, the sheriff,
 to precipitate the result which they were called to prevent.
 It was Fear who handcuffed Mortal Man and would now
 punish him. You have left Mortal Man no alternative.
 He must obey your law, fear its consequences, and be punished for his fear. His friends struggled hard to rescue the
 prisoner from the penalty they considered justly due, but
 they were compelled to let him be taken into custody, tried,
 and condemned. Thereupon Judge Medicine sat in judgment on the case, and substantially charged the jury, twelve
 Mortal Minds, to find the prisoner guilty. His Honor sentenced Mortal Man to die for the very deeds which the divine law compels man to commit. Thus the Court of Error
 construed obedience to the law of divine Love as disobedience to the law of Life. Claiming to protect Mortal Man
 in right-doing, that court pronounced a sentence of death
 for doing right.
 </p><p></p><p>One of the principal witnesses, Nerve, testified that he
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_437"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 437</font></a></p><p></p><p>was a ruler of Body, in which province Mortal Man resides. 
 He also testified that he was on intimate terms with the
 plaintiff, and knew Personal Sense to be truthful; that he 
 knew Man, and that Man was made in the image of God,
 but was a criminal. This is a foul aspersion on man's
 Maker. It blots the fair escutcheon of omnipotence. It indicates malice aforethought, a determination to condemn
 Man in the interest of Personal Sense. At the bar of Truth,
 in the presence of divine Justice, before the Judge of our 
 higher tribunal, the Supreme Court of Spirit, and before
 its jurors, the Spiritual Senses, I proclaim this witness,
 Nerve, to be destitute of intelligence and truth and to be 
 a false witness.
 </p><p></p><p>Man self-destroyed; the testimony of matter respected;
 Spirit not allowed a hearing; Soul a criminal though 
 recommended to mercy; the helpless innocent body tortured,--these are the terrible records of your Court of
 Error, and I ask that the Supreme Court of Spirit reverse
 this decision.
 </p><p></p><p>Here the opposing counsel, False Belief, called Christian Science to order for contempt of court. Various 
 notables - Materia Medica, Anatomy, Physiology, Scholastic Theology, and Jurisprudence - rose to the question of expelling Christian Science from the bar, for such 
 high-handed illegality. They declared that Christian Science was overthrowing the judicial proceedings of a regularly constituted court.  
   
 But Judge Justice of the Supreme Court of Spirit overruled their motions on the ground that unjust usages
 were not allowed at the bar of Truth, which ranks above 
 the lower Court of Error.
 </p><p></p><p>The attorney, Christian Science, then read from the
 supreme statute-book, the Bible, certain extracts on the 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_438"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 438</font></a></p><p></p><p>Rights of Man, remarking, that the Bible was better authority than Blackstone: </p><p></p><p>Let us make man in our image, after our likeness; and
 let them have dominion.<br>
 </p><p></p><p>Behold, I give unto you power . . . over all the power
 of the enemy: and nothing shall by any means hurt you.<br>
 </p><p></p><p>If a man keep my saying, he shall never see death.
 </p><p></p><p>Then Christian Science proved the witness, Nerve, to
 be a perjurer. Instead of being a ruler in the Province
 of Body, in which Mortal Man was reported to reside,
 Nerve was an insubordinate citizen, putting in false
 claims to office and bearing false witness against Man.
 Turning suddenly to Personal Sense, by this time silent,
 Christian Science continued: </p><p></p><p>I ask your arrest in the name of Almighty God on three
 distinct charges of crime, to wit: perjury, treason, and conspiracy against the rights and life of man.
 </p><p></p><p>Then Christian Science continued:
 </p><p></p><p>Another witness, equally inadequate, said that on the
 night of the crime a garment of foul fur was spread over
 him by Morbid Secretion, while the facts in the case show
 that this fur is a foreign substance, imported by False Belief, the attorney for Personal Sense, who is in partnership
 with Error and smuggles Error's goods into market without the inspection of Soul's government officers. When
 the Court of Truth summoned Furred Tongue for examination, he disappeared and was never heard of more.
 </p><p></p><p>Morbid Secretion is not an importer or dealer in fur, but
 we have heard Materia Medica explain how this fur is
 manufactured, and we know Morbid Secretion to be on
 friendly terms with the firm of Personal Sense, Error, &amp;
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_439"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 439</font></a></p><p></p><p>Co., receiving pay from them and introducing their goods 
 into the market. Also, be it known that False Belief, the
 counsel for the plaintiff, Personal Sense, is a buyer for this 
 firm. He manufactures for it, keeps a furnishing store,
 and advertises largely for his employers.
 </p><p></p><p>Death testified that he was absent from the Province of 
 Body, when a message came from False Belief, commanding him to take part in the homicide. At this request
 Death repaired to the spot where the liver-complaint was 
 in process, frightening away Materia Medica, who was then
 manacling the prisoner in the attempt to save him. True,
 Materia Medica was a misguided participant in the misdeed 
 for which the Health-officer had Mortal Man in custody,
 though Mortal Man was innocent.
 </p><p></p><p>Christian Science turned from the abashed witnesses, 
 his words flashing as lightning in the perturbed faces
 of these worthies, Scholastic Theology, Materia Medica,
 Physiology, the blind Hypnotism, and the masked Personal Sense, and said: </p><p></p><p>God will smite you, O whited walls, for injuring in your
 ignorance the unfortunate Mortal Man who sought your 
 aid in his struggles against liver-complaint and Death.
 You came to his rescue, only to fasten upon him an offence
 of which he was innocent. You aided and abetted Fear 
 and Health-laws. You betrayed Mortal Man, meanwhile
 declaring Disease to be God's servant and the righteous
 executor of His laws. Our higher statutes declare you all,
 witnesses, jurors, and judges, to be offenders, awaiting the
 sentence which General Progress and Divine Love will
 pronounce.  
    
 We send our best detectives to whatever locality is reported to be haunted by Disease, but on visiting the spot,
 they learn that Disease was never there, for he could not 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_440"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 440</font></a></p><p></p><p>possibly elude their search. Your Material Court of Errors,
 when it condemned Mortal Man on the ground of hygienic
 disobedience, was manipulated by the oleaginous machinations of the counsel, False Belief, whom Truth arraigns
 before the supreme bar of Spirit to answer for his crime.
 Morbid Secretion is taught how to make sleep befool reason
 before sacrificing mortals to their false gods.
 </p><p></p><p>Mortal Minds were deceived by your attorney, False Belief, and were influenced to give a verdict delivering Mortal
 Man to Death. Good deeds are transformed into crimes,
 to which you attach penalties; but no warping of justice
 can render disobedience to the so-called laws of Matter
 disobedience to God, or an act of homicide. Even penal
 law holds homicide, under stress of circumstances, to be
 justifiable. Now what greater justification can any deed
 have, than that it is for the good of one's neighbor? Wherefore, then, in the name of outraged justice, do you sentence
 Mortal Man for ministering to the wants of his fellow-man
 in obedience to divine law? You cannot trample upon the
 decree of the Supreme Bench. Mortal Man has his appeal
 to Spirit, God, who sentences only for sin.
 </p><p></p><p>The false and unjust beliefs of your human mental legislators compel them to enact wicked laws of sickness and so
 forth, and then render obedience to these laws punishable
 as crime. In the presence of the Supreme Lawgiver, standing at the bar of Truth, and in accordance with the divine
 statutes, I repudiate the false testimony of Personal. Sense.
 I ask that he be forbidden to enter against Mortal Man
 any more suits to be tried at the Court of Material Error.
 I appeal to the just and equitable decisions of divine Spirit
 to restore to Mortal Man the rights of which he has been
 deprived.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Charge of the Chief Justice</font></p>
 Here the counsel for the defence closed, and the Chief
 Justice of the Supreme Court, with benign and imposing
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_441"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 441</font></a></p><p></p><p>presence, comprehending and defining all law and evidence, explained from his statute-book, the 
 Bible, that any so-called law, which undertakes to punish aught but sin, is null and void.
 </p><p></p><p>He also decided that the plaintiff, Personal Sense, be
 not permitted to enter any suits at the bar of Soul, but 
 be enjoined to keep perpetual silence, and in case of
 temptation, to give heavy bonds for good behavior. He
 concluded his charge thus:--  
 </p><p></p><p>The plea of False Belief we deem unworthy of a hearing.
 Let what False Belief utters, now and forever, fall into
 oblivion, "unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown." According to our statute, Material Law is a liar who cannot bear
 witness against Mortal Man, neither can Fear arrest Mortal
 Man nor can Disease cast him into prison. Our law refuses 
 to recognize Man as sick or dying, but holds him to be forever in the image and likeness of his Maker. Reversing the
 testimony of Personal Sense and the decrees of the Court of 
 Error in favor of Matter, Spirit decides in favor of Man
 and against Matter. We further recommend that Materia
 Medica adopt Christian Science and that Health-laws, 
 Mesmerism, Hypnotism, Oriental Witchcraft, and Esoteric
 Magic be publicly executed at the hands of our sheriff,
 Progress.    
  
 The Supreme Bench decides in favor of intelligence, that
 no law outside of divine Mind can punish or reward Mortal
 Man. Your personal jurors in the Court of Error are 
 myths. Your attorney, False Belief, is an impostor, persuading Mortal Minds to return a verdict contrary to law
 and gospel. The plaintiff, Personal Sense, is recorded in 
 our Book of books as a liar. Our great Teacher of mental
 jurisprudence speaks of him also as "a murderer from the
 beginning." We have no trials for sickness before the tri</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_442"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 442</font></a></p><p></p><p>bunal of divine Spirit. There, Man is adjudged innocent
 of transgressing physical laws, because there are no such
 laws. Our statute is spiritual, our Government is divine.
 "Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?"

 The Jury of Spiritual Senses agreed at once upon a
 verdict, and there resounded throughout the vast audiencechamber of Spirit the cry, Not guilty. Then
 the prisoner rose up regenerated, strong, free.
 We noticed, as he shook hands with his counsel, Christian Science, that all sallowness and debility had disappeared. His form was erect and commanding, his
 countenance beaming with health and happiness. Divine
 Love had cast out fear. Mortal Man, no longer sick
 and in prison, walked forth, his feet "beautiful upon the
 mountains," as of one "that bringeth good tidings."

 Neither animal magnetism nor hypnotism enters into
 the practice of Christian Science, in which truth cannot
 be reversed, but the reverse of error is true.
 An improved belief cannot retrograde. When
 Christ changes a belief of sin or of sickness into
 a better belief, then belief melts into spiritual understanding, and sin, disease, and death disappear. Christ, Truth,
 gives mortals temporary food and clothing until the material, transformed with the ideal, disappears, and man
 is clothed and fed spiritually. St. Paul says, "Work
 out your own salvation with fear and trembling:" Jesus
 said, "Fear not, little flock; for it is your Father's good
 pleasure to give you the kingdom." This truth is
 Christian Science.
 <p></p><p>Christian Scientists, be a law to yourselves that mental
 malpractice cannot harm you either when asleep or when
 awake.
