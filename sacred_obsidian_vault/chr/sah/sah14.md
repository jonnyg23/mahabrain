 </p><p></p><p>THIS chapter is from the first edition of the author's 
 class-book, copyrighted in 1870. After much labor
 and increased spiritual understanding, she revised that 
 treatise for this volume in 1875. Absolute Christian
 Science pervades its statements, to elucidate scientific
 metaphysics.          
 </p><p></p><center>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</center>
 <p>Question.--What is God?
 Answer.--God is incorporeal, divine, supreme, infinite 
 Mind, Spirit, Soul, Principle, Life, Truth, Love.
 </p><p></p><p>Question.--Are these terms synonymous?
 Answer.--They are. They refer to one absolute God. 
 They are also intended to express the nature, essence, and
 wholeness of Deity. The attributes of God are justice,
 mercy, wisdom, goodness, and so on.     
 </p><p></p><p>Question.--Is there more than one God or Principle?
 Answer.--There is not. Principle and its idea is one,
 and this one is God, omnipotent, omniscient, and omni</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_466"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 466</font></a></p><p></p><p>present Being, and His reflection is man and the universe.
 Omni is adopted from the Latin adjective signifying all.
 Hence God combines all-power or potency, all-science
 or true knowledge, all-presence. The varied manifestations of Christian Science indicate Mind, never matter,
 and have one Principle.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Real versus unreal</font></p>
 Question.--What are spirits and souls?
 Answer.--To human belief, they are personalities
 constituted of mind and matter, life and death, truth and
 error, good and evil; but these contrasting
 pairs of terms represent contraries, as Christian Science reveals, which neither dwell together nor
 assimilate. Truth is immortal; error is mortal. Truth
 is limitless; error is limited. Truth is intelligent; error
 is non-intelligent. Moreover, Truth is real, and error is
 unreal. This last statement contains the point you will
 most reluctantly admit, although first and last it is the
 most important to understand.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mankind redeemed</font></p>
 The term souls or spirits is as improper as the term
 gods. Soul or Spirit signifies Deity and nothing else.
 There is no finite soul nor spirit. Soul or
 Spirit means only one Mind, and cannot be
 rendered in the plural. Heathen mythology and Jewish
 theology have perpetuated the fallacy that intelligence,
 soul, and life can be in matter; and idolatry and ritualism
 are the outcome of all man-made beliefs. The Science
 of Christianity comes with fan in hand to separate the
 chaff from the wheat. Science will declare God aright,
 and Christianity will demonstrate this declaration and
 its divine Principle, making mankind better physically,
 morally, and spiritually.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_467"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 467</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Two chief commands</font></p>
 Question.--What are the demands of the Science of 
 Soul?
 Answer.--The first demand of this Science is, "Thou 
 shalt have no other gods before me." This me is Spirit.
 Therefore the command means this: Thou shalt 
 have no intelligence, no life, no substance, no  
 truth, no love, but that which is spiritual. The second
 is like unto it, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself."
 It should be thoroughly understood that all men have one 
 Mind, one God and Father, one Life, Truth, and Love.
 Mankind will become perfect in proportion as this fact
 becomes apparent, war will cease and the true brotherhood of man will be established. Having no other gods,
 turning to no other but the one perfect Mind to guide
 him, man is the likeness of God, pure and eternal, having that Mind which was also in Christ.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soul not confined in body</font></p>
 Science reveals Spirit, Soul, as not in the body, and
 God as not in man but as reflected by man. The greater 
 cannot be in the lesser. The belief that the
 greater can be in the lesser is an error that 
 works ill. This is a leading point in the Science of Soul, 
 that Principle is not in its idea. Spirit, Soul, is not
 confined in man, and is never in matter. We reason imperfectly from effect to cause, when we conclude that 
 matter is the effect of Spirit; but a priori reasoning
 shows material existence to be enigmatical. Spirit gives
 the true mental idea. We cannot interpret Spirit, Mind, 
 through matter. Matter neither sees, hears, nor feels.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sinlessness of Mind, Soul</font></p>
 Reasoning from cause to effect in the Science of Mind,
 we begin with Mind, which must be understood through the idea which expresses it and 
 cannot be learned from its opposite, matter. Thus we
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_468"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 468</font></a></p><p></p><p>arrive at Truth, or intelligence, which evolves its own
 unerring idea and never can be coordinate with human
 illusions. If Soul sinned, it would be mortal, for sin is
 mortality's self, because it kills itself. If Truth is immortal, error must be mortal, because error is unlike
 Truth. Because Soul is immortal, Soul cannot sin, for
 sin is not the eternal verity of being.
 </p><p></p><p>Question.--What is the scientific statement of being?
 Answer. - There is no life, truth, intelligence, nor substance in matter. All is infinite Mind and its infinite
 manifestation, for God is All-in-all. Spirit is immortal
 Truth; matter is mortal error. Spirit is the real and
 eternal; matter is the unreal and temporal. Spirit is
 God, and man is His image and likeness. Therefore
 man is not material; he is spiritual.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual synonyms</font></p>
 Question.--What is substance?
 Answer. - Substance is that which is eternal and incapable of discord and decay. Truth, Life, and Love are
 substance, as the Scriptures use this word in
 Hebrews: "The substance of things hoped
 for, the evidence of things not seen." Spirit, the synonym
 of Mind, Soul, or God, is the only real substance. The
 spiritual universe, including individual man, is a compound idea, reflecting the divine substance of Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Eternity of Life</font></p>
 Question.--What is Life?
 Answer.--Life is divine Principle, Mind, Soul, Spirit.
 Life is without beginning and without end.
 Eternity, not time, expresses the thought of
 Life, and time is no part of eternity. One ceases in
 proportion as the other is recognized. Time is finite;
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_469"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 469</font></a></p><p></p><p>eternity is forever infinite. Life is neither in nor of matter. What is termed matter is unknown to Spirit, which
 includes in itself all substance and is Life eternal. Matter is a human concept. Life is divine Mind. Life is not
 limited. Death and finiteness are unknown to Life. If
 Life ever had a beginning, it would also have an ending. 
 </p><p></p><p>Question.--What is intelligence?
 Answer.--Intelligence is omniscience, omnipresence,
 and omnipotence. It is the primal and eternal quality 
 of infinite Mind, of the triune Principle,--Life, Truth,
 and Love,--named God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True sense of infinitude</font></p>
 Question.--What is Mind?        
 Answer.--Mind is God. The exterminator of error
 is the great truth that God, good, is the only Mind, and
 that the supposititious opposite of infinite Mind 
 - called devil or evil--is not Mind, is not   
 Truth, but error, without intelligence or reality. There
 can be but one Mind, because there is but one God; and 
 if mortals claimed no other Mind and accepted no other,
 sin would be unknown. We can have but one Mind, if
 that one is infinite. We bury the sense of infinitude, 
 when we admit that, although God is infinite, evil has a
 place in this infinity, for evil can have no place, where all
 space is filled with God.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The sole governor</font></p>
 We lose the high signification of omnipotence, when
 after admitting that God, or good, is omnipresent and
 has all-power, we still believe there is another 
 power, named evil. This belief that there
 is more than one mind is as pernicious to divine theology
 as are ancient mythology and pagan idolatry. With 
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_470"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 470</font></a></p><p></p><p>one Father, even God, the whole family of man would
 be brethren; and with one Mind and that God, or good,
 the brotherhood of man would consist of Love and Truth,
 and have unity of Principle and spiritual power which
 constitute divine Science. The supposed existence of
 more than one mind was the basic error of idolatry. This
 error assumed the loss of spiritual power, the loss of the
 spiritual presence of Life as infinite Truth without an
 unlikeness, and the loss of Love as ever present and
 universal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The divine standard of perfection</font></p>
 Divine Science explains the abstract statement that
 there is one Mind by the following self-evident proposition: If God, or good, is real, then evil, the
 unlikeness of God, is unreal. And evil can
 only seem to be real by giving reality to the
 unreal. The children of God have but one Mind. How
 can good lapse into evil, when God, the Mind of man,
 never sins? The standard of perfection was originally
 God and man. Has God taken down His own standard,
 and has man fallen?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Indestructible relationship</font></p>
 God is the creator of man, and, the divine Principle
 of man remaining perfect, the divine idea or reflection,
 man, remains perfect. Man is the expression
 of God's being. If there ever was a moment
 when man did not express the divine perfection, then there was a moment when man did not express
 God, and consequently a time when Deity was unexpressed - that is, without entity. If man has lost perfection, then he has lost his perfect Principle, the divine
 Mind. If man ever existed without this perfect Principle
 or Mind, then man's existence was a myth.
 <p></p><p>The relations of God and man, divine Principle and
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_471"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 471</font></a></p><p></p><p>idea, are indestructible in Science; and Science knows 
 no lapse from nor return to harmony, but holds the divine
 order or spiritual law, in which God and all that He creates are perfect and eternal, to have remained unchanged
 in its eternal history.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Celestial evidence</font></p>
 The unlikeness of Truth, - named error, - the opposite of Science, and the evidence before the five corporeal senses, afford no indication of the grand
 facts of being; even as these so-called senses 
 receive no intimation of the earth's motions or of the
 science of astronomy, but yield assent to astronomical
 propositions on the authority of natural science. 
   
 The facts of divine Science should be admitted, although the evidence as to these facts is not supported
 by evil, by matter, or by material sense,--because the 
 evidence that God and man coexist is fully sustained by
 spiritual sense. Man is, and forever has been, God's reflection. God is infinite, therefore ever present, and 
 there is no other power nor presence. Hence the spirituality of the universe is the only fact of creation. "Let
 God be true, but every [material] man a liar."   
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The test of experience</font></p>
 Question.--Are doctrines and creeds a benefit to man?
 Answer.--The author subscribed to an orthodox
 creed in early youth, and tried to adhere to it until she 
 caught the first gleam of that which interprets God as above mortal sense.  This
 view rebuked human beliefs, and gave the spiritual import, expressed through Science, of all that proceeds
 from the divine Mind. Since then her highest creed has
 been divine Science, which, reduced to human apprehension, she has named Christian Science. This Science
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_472"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 472</font></a></p><p></p><p>teaches man that God is the only Life, and that this Life
 is Truth and Love; that God is to be understood, adored,
 and demonstrated; that divine Truth casts out suppositional error and heals the sick.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God's law destroys evil</font></p>
 The way which leads to Christian Science is straight
 and narrow. God has set His signet upon Science, making it coordinate with all that is real and only
 with that which is harmonious and eternal.
 Sickness, sin, and death, being inharmonious, do not
 originate in God nor belong to His government. His
 law, rightly understood, destroys them. Jesus furnished
 proofs of these statements.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evanescent materiality</font></p>
 Question.--What is error?
 Answer.--Error is a supposition that pleasure and
 pain, that intelligence, substance, life, are existent in matter. Error is neither Mind nor one of Mind's
 faculties. Error is the contradiction of Truth.
 Error is a belief without understanding. Error is unreal
 because untrue. It is that which seemeth to be and is not.
 If error were true, its truth would be error, and we should
 have a self-evident absurdity--namely, erroneous truth.
 Thus we should continue to lose the standard of Truth.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unrealities that seem real</font></p>
 Question.--Is there no sin?
 Answer. - All reality is in God and His creation, harmonious and eternal. That which He creates is good,
 and He makes all that is made. Therefore
 the only reality of sin, sickness, or death is
 the awful fact that unrealities seem real to human, erring
 belief, until God strips off their disguise. They are not
 true, because they are not of God. We learn in Christian
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_473"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 473</font></a></p><p></p><p>Science that all inharmony of mortal mind or body is illusion, possessing neither reality nor identity though seeming
 to be real and identical.   
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christ the ideal Truth</font></p>
 The Science of Mind disposes of all evil. Truth, God,
 is not the father of error. Sin, sickness, and death are
 to be classified as effects of error.  Christ
 came to destroy the belief of sin. The Godprinciple is omnipresent and omnipotent. God is everywhere, and nothing apart from Him is present or has 
 power. Christ is the ideal Truth, that comes to heal
 sickness and sin through Christian Science, and attributes
 all power to God. Jesus is the name of the man who, 
 more than all other men, has presented Christ, the true
 idea of God, healing the sick and the sinning and destroying the power of death. Jesus is the human man, and 
 Christ is the divine idea; hence the duality of Jesus the
 Christ.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jesus not God</font></p>
 In an age of ecclesiastical despotism, Jesus introduced 
 the teaching and practice of Christianity, affording the
 proof of Christianity's truth and love; but to 
 reach his example and to test its unerring Sci-   
 ence according to his rule, healing sickness, sin, and
 death, a better understanding of God as divine Principle, Love, rather than personality or the man Jesus, is 
 required.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jesus not understood</font></p>
 Jesus established what he said by demonstration,
 thus making his acts of higher importance than his 
 words. He proved what he taught. This 
 is the Science of Christianity. Jesus proved 
 the Principle, which heals the sick and casts out error, 
 to be divine. Few, however, except his students understood in the least his teachings and their glorious
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_474"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 474</font></a></p><p></p><p>proofs, - namely, that Life, Truth, and Love (the Principle of this unacknowledged Science) destroy all error,
 evil, disease, and death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Miracles rejected</font></p>
 The reception accorded to Truth in the early Christian era is repeated to-day.  Whoever introduces the
 Science of Christianity will be scoffed at and
 scourged with worse cords than those which
 cut the flesh.  To the ignorant age in which it first
 appears, Science seems to be a mistake,--hence the
 misinterpretation and consequent maltreatment which
 it receives. Christian marvels (and marvel is the simple meaning of the Greek word rendered miracle in the
 New Testament) will be misunderstood and misused
 by many, until the glorious Principle of these marvels is
 gained.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine fulfilment</font></p>
 If sin, sickness, and death are as real as Life, Truth,
 and Love, then they must all be from the same source;
 God must be their author. Now Jesus came
 to destroy sin, sickness, and death  yet the
 Scriptures aver, "I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil."
 Is it possible, then, to believe that the evils which Jesus
 lived to destroy are real or the offspring of the divine
 will?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth destroys falsity</font></p>
 Despite the hallowing influence of Truth in the destruction of error, must error still be immortal? Truth
 spares all that is true. If evil is real, Truth
 must make it so; but error, not Truth, is
 the author of the unreal, and the unreal vanishes,
 while all that is real is eternal. The apostle says that
 the mission of Christ is to "destroy the works of the
 devil." Truth destroys falsity and error, for light and
 darkness cannot dwell together. Light extinguishes the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_475"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 475</font></a></p><p></p><p>darkness, and the Scripture declares that there is "no 
 night there." To Truth there is no error,--all is Truth.
 To infinite Spirit there is no matter,--all is Spirit, divine 
 Principle and its idea.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fleshly factors unreal</font></p>
 Question.--What is man?
 Answer.--Man is not matter; he is not made up of
 brain, blood, bones, and other material elements. The
 Scriptures inform us that man is made in 
 the image and likeness of God. Matter is 
 not that likeness. The likeness of Spirit cannot be so
 unlike Spirit. Man is spiritual and perfect; and because he is spiritual and perfect, he must be so understood in Christian Science. Man is idea, the image, of
 Love; lie is not physique. He is the compound idea of
 God, including all right ideas; the generic term for 
 all that reflects God's image and likeness; the conscious
 identity of being as found in Science, in which man is
 the reflection of God, or Mind, and therefore is eternal; 
 that which has no separate mind from God; that which
 has not a single quality underived from Deity; that which
 possesses no life, intelligence, nor creative power of his 
 own, but reflects spiritually all that belongs to his Maker.
 <p></p><p>And God said: "Let us make man in our image, after
 our likeness; and let them have dominion over the fish 
 of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle,
 and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that
 creepeth upon the earth."     
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man unfallen</font></p>
 Man is incapable of sin, sickness, and death. The
 real man cannot depart from holiness, nor 
 can God, by whom man is evolved, engender   
 the capacity or freedom to sin.  A mortal sinner is not
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_476"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 476</font></a></p><p></p><p>God's man. Mortals are the counterfeits of immortals.
 They are the children of the wicked one, or the one evil,
 which declares that man begins in dust or as a material
 embryo. In divine Science, God and the real man are
 inseparable as divine Principle and idea.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortals are not immortals</font></p>
 Error, urged to its final limits, is self-destroyed.
 Error will cease to claim that soul is in body, that life
 and intelligence are in matter, and that
 this matter is man. God is the Principle of
 man, and man is the idea of God. Hence man is not
 mortal nor material. Mortals will disappear, and immortals, or the children of God, will appear as the only
 and eternal verities of man. Mortals are not fallen children of God. They never had a perfect state of being,
 which may subsequently be regained. They were, from
 the beginning of mortal history, "conceived in sin and
 brought forth in iniquity." Mortality is finally swallowed
 up in immortality. Sin, sickness, and death must disappear to give place to the facts which belong to immortal
 man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Imperishable identity</font></p>
 Learn this, O mortal, and earnestly seek the spiritual
 status of man, which is outside of all material selfhood.
 Remember that the Scriptures say of mortal
 man: "As for man, his days are as grass: as
 a flower of the field, so he flourisheth. For the wind
 passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place thereof shall
 know it no more."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The kingdom within</font></p>
 When speaking of God's children, not the children of
 men, Jesus said, "The kingdom of God is within you;"
 that is, Truth and Love reign in the real
 man, showing that man in God's image is
 unfallen and eternal. Jesus beheld in Science the per<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_477"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 477</font></a></p><p></p><p>fect man, who appeared to him where sinning mortal 
 man appears to mortals. In this perfect man the Saviour
 saw God's own likeness, and this correct view of man 
 healed the sick. Thus Jesus taught that the kingdom
 of God is intact, universal, and that man is pure and holy.
 Man is not a material habitation for Soul; he is himself 
 spiritual. Soul, being Spirit, is seen in nothing imperfect
 nor material.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material body never God's idea</font></p>
 Whatever is material is mortal. To the five corporeal 
 senses, man appears to be matter and mind united; but
 Christian Science reveals man as the idea of
 God, and declares the corporeal senses to be  
 mortal and erring illusions. Divine Science 
 shows it to be impossible that a material body, though
 interwoven with matter's highest stratum, misnamed 
 mind, should be man,--the genuine and perfect man,
 the immortal idea of being, indestructible and eternal.
 Were it otherwise, man would be annihilated.    
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reflection of Spirit</font></p>
 Question.--What are body and Soul?
 Answer. - Identity is the reflection of Spirit, the reflection in multifarious forms of the living Principle, 
 Love. Soul is the substance, Life, and intelligence of man, which is individualized, but not 
 in matter. Soul can never reflect anything inferior to 
 Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man inseparable from Spirit</font></p>
 Man is the expression of Soul. The Indians caught
 some glimpses of the underlying reality, when 
 they called a certain beautiful lake "the smile 
 of the Great Spirit." Separated from man, 
 who expresses Soul, Spirit would be a nonentity; man, 
 divorced from Spirit, would lose his entity. But there is,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_478"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 478</font></a></p><p></p><p>there can be, no such division, for man is coexistent with
 God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A vacant domicile</font></p>
 What evidence of Soul or of immortality have you
 within mortality? Even according to the teachings of
 natural science, man has never beheld Spirit
 or Soul leaving a body or entering it. What
 basis is there for the theory of indwelling spirit, except
 the claim of mortal belief? What would be thought of
 the declaration that a house was inhabited, and by a certain class of persons, when no such persons were ever seen
 to go into the house or to come out of it, nor were they
 even visible through the windows? Who can see a soul
 in the body?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Harmonious functions</font></p>
 Question.--Does brain think, and do nerves feel, and
 is there intelligence in matter?
 Answer.--No, not if God is true and mortal man a
 liar. The assertion that there can be pain or pleasure
 in matter is erroneous. That body is most
 harmonious in which the discharge of the natural functions is least noticeable. How can intelligence
 dwell in matter when matter is non-intelligent and
 brain-lobes cannot think? Matter cannot perform the
 functions of Mind. Error says, "I am man;" but this
 belief is mortal and far from actual. From beginning
 to end, whatever is mortal is composed of material human beliefs and of nothing else. That only is real which
 reflects God. St. Paul said, "But when it pleased God,
 who separated me from my mother's womb, and called me
 by His grace, . . . I conferred not with flesh and blood."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Immortal birthright</font></p>
 Mortal man is really a self-contradictory phrase, for
 man is not mortal, "neither indeed can be;" man is im<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_479"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 479</font></a></p><p></p><p>mortal. If a child is the offspring of physical sense and 
 not of Soul, the child must have a material, not a spiritual origin. With what truth, then, could the 
 Scriptural rejoicing be uttered by any mother, 
 "I have gotten a man from the Lord"? On the contrary, if aught comes from God, it cannot be mortal and 
 material; it must be immortal and spiritual.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Matter's supposed selfhood</font></p>
 Matter is neither self-existent nor a product of Spirit.
 An image of mortal thought, reflected on the retina, is 
 all that the eye beholds. Matter cannot see, 
 feel, hear, taste, nor smell.  It is not selfcognizant,--cannot feel itself, see itself, nor 
 understand itself. Take away so-called mortal mind,
 which constitutes matter's supposed selfhood, and matter
 can take no cognizance of matter. Does that which we 
 call dead ever see, hear, feel, or use any of the physical
 senses?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Chaos and darkness</font></p>
 "In the beginning God created the heaven and the 
 earth. And the earth was without form, and void; and
 darkness was upon the face of the deep."
 (Genesis i. 1, 2.) In the vast forever, in the 
 Science and truth of being, the only facts are Spirit
 and its innumerable creations.  Darkness and chaos
 are the imaginary opposites of  light, understanding, 
 and eternal harmony, and they  are the elements of
 nothingness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual reflection</font></p>
 We admit that black is not a color, because it reflects 
 no light. So evil should be denied identity or power,
 because it has none of the divine hues. Paul 
 says: "For the invisible things of Him, from 
 the creation of the world, are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made." (Romans i. 20.)
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_480"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 480</font></a></p><p></p><p>When the substance of Spirit appears in Christian Science, the nothingness of matter is recognized. Where
 the spirit of God is, and there is no place where God is
 not, evil becomes nothing, - the opposite of the something of Spirit. If there is no spiritual reflection, then
 there remains only the darkness of vacuity and not a trace
 of heavenly tints.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Harmony from Spirit</font></p>
 Nerves are an element of the belief that there is sensation in matter, whereas matter is devoid of sensation.
 Consciousness, as well as action, is governed
 by Mind, - is in God, the origin and governor of all that Science reveals. Material sense has
 its realm apart from Science in the unreal. Harmonious
 action proceeds from Spirit, God. inharmony has no
 Principle; its action is erroneous and presupposes man
 to be in matter. Inharmony would make matter the
 cause as well as the effect of intelligence, or Soul, thus
 attempting to separate Mind from God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evil non-existent</font></p>
 Man is not God, and God is not man. Again, God,
 or good, never made man capable of sin. It is the opposite of good--that is, evil--which seems to
 make men capable of wrong-doing. Hence,
 evil is but an illusion, and it has no real basis. Evil is a
 false belief. God is not its author. The supposititious
 parent of evil is a lie.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Vapor and nothingness</font></p>
 The Bible declares: "All things were made by Him
 [the divine Word]; and without Him was not anything,
 made that was made." This is the eternal
 verity of divine Science. If sin, sickness,
 death were understood as nothingness, they would disappear. As vapor melts before the sun, so evil would
 vanish before the reality of good. One must hide the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_481"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 481</font></a></p><p></p><p>other. How important, then, to choose good as the 
 reality! Man is tributary to God, Spirit, and to nothing
 else. God's being is infinity, freedom, harmony, and 
 boundless bliss. "Where the Spirit of the Lord is,
 there is liberty." Like the archpriests of yore, man is
 free "to enter into the holiest,"--the realm of God.  
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The fruit forbidden</font></p>
 Material sense never helps mortals to understand
 Spirit, God. Through spiritual sense only, man comprehends and loves Deity. The various con-  
 tradictions of the Science of Mind by the material senses do not change the unseen Truth, which remains forever intact. The forbidden fruit of knowledge, 
 against which wisdom warns man, is the testimony of
 error, declaring existence to be at the mercy of death,
 and good and evil to be capable of commingling. This 
 is the significance of the Scripture concerning this "tree
 of the knowledge of good and evil,"--this growth of
 material belief, of which it is said: "In the day that thou
 eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." Human hypotheses
 first assume the reality of sickness, sin, and death, and
 then assume the necessity of these evils because of their 
 admitted actuality. These human verdicts are the procurers of all discord.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sense and pure Soul</font></p>
 If Soul sins, it must be mortal. Sin has the elements 
 of self-destruction. It cannot sustain itself.  If sin is
 supported, God must uphold it, and this is 
 impossible, since Truth cannot support error.  
 Soul is the divine Principle of man and never sins, hence the immortality of Soul. In Science we learn that
 it is material sense, not Soul, which sins; and it will be 
 found that it is the sense of sin which is lost, and not a
 sinful soul. When reading the Scriptures, the substitu<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_482"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 482</font></a></p><p></p><p>tion of the word sense for soul gives the exact meaning in
 a majority of cases.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soul defined</font></p>
 Human thought has adulterated the meaning of the
 word soul through the hypothesis that soul is both an evil
 and a good intelligence, resident in matter.
 The proper use of the word soul can always
 be gained by substituting the word God, where the deific
 meaning is required. In other cases, use the word sense,
 and you will have the scientific signification. As used
 in Christian Science, Soul is properly the synonym of
 Spirit, or God; but out of Science, soul is identical with
 sense, with material sensation.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sonship of Jesus</font></p>
 Question. - Is it important to understand these explanations in order to heal the sick?
 Answer.--It is, since Christ is "the way" and the
 truth casting out all error. Jesus called himself "the
 Son of man," but not the son of Joseph. As
 woman is but a species of the genera, he was
 literally the Son of Man. Jesus was the highest human
 concept of the perfect man. He was inseparable from
 Christ, the Messiah,--the divine idea of God outside
 the flesh. This enabled Jesus to demonstrate his control over matter. Angels announced to the Wisemen of
 old this dual appearing, and angels whisper it, through
 faith, to the hungering heart in every age.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sickness erroneous</font></p>
 Sickness is part of the error which Truth casts out.
 Error will not expel error. Christian Science is the law
 of Truth, which heals the sick, on the basis
 of the one Mind or God. It can heal in no
 other way, since the human, mortal mind so-called is not
 a healer, but causes the belief in disease.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_483"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 483</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True healing transcendent</font></p>
 Then comes the question, how do drugs, hygiene, and 
 animal magnetism heal? It may be affirmed that they
 do not heal, but only relieve suffering temporarily, exchanging one disease for another.
 We classify disease as error, which nothing but Truth or
 Mind can heal, and this Mind must be divine, not human. 
 Mind transcends all other power, and will ultimately supersede all other means in healing. In order to heal by
 Science, you must not be ignorant of the moral and spiritual demands of Science nor disobey them. Moral ignorance or sin affects your demonstration, and hinders its
 approach to the standard in Christian Science. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Terms adopted by the author</font></p>
 After the author's sacred discovery, she affixed the
 name "Science" to Christianity, the name "error" to
 corporeal sense, and the name "substance" to 
 Mind. Science has called the world to battle 
 over this issue and its demonstration, which 
 heals the sick, destroys error, and reveals the universal 
 harmony. To those natural Christian Scientists, the ancient worthies, and to Christ Jesus, God certainly revealed
 the spirit of Christian Science, if not the absolute letter. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Science the way</font></p>
 Because the Science of Mind seems to bring into dishonor the ordinary scientific schools, which wrestle with
 material observations alone, this Science has 
 met with opposition; but if any system honors 
 God, it ought to receive aid, not opposition, from all thinking persons. And Christian Science does honor God as 
 no other theory honors Him, and it does this in the way
 of His appointing, by doing many wonderful works
 through the divine name and nature. One must fulfil 
 one's mission without timidity or dissimulation, for to be
 well done, the work must be done unselfishly. Christianity
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_484"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 484</font></a></p><p></p><p>will never be based on a divine Principle and so found to
 be unerring, until its absolute Science is reached. When
 this is accomplished, neither pride, prejudice, bigotry,
 nor envy can wash away its foundation, for it is built upon
 the rock, Christ.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mindless methods</font></p>
 Question.--Does Christian Science, or metaphysical
 healing, include medication, material hygiene, mesmerism, hypnotism, theosophy, or spiritualism?
 Answer. - Not one of them is included in it. In divine Science, the supposed laws of matter yield to the
 law of Mind.  What are termed natural
 science and material laws are the objective
 states of mortal mind. The physical universe expresses
 the conscious and unconscious thoughts of mortals.
 Physical force and mortal mind are one. Drugs and
 hygiene oppose the supremacy of the divine Mind.
 Drugs and inert matter are unconscious, mindless. Certain results, supposed to proceed from drugs, are really
 caused by the faith in them which the false human consciousness is educated to feel.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Animal magnetism error</font></p>
 Mesmerism is mortal, material illusion. Animal magnetism is the voluntary or involuntary action of error
 in all its forms; it is the human antipode
 of divine Science. Science must  triumph
 over material sense, and Truth over error, thus putting
 an end to the hypotheses involved in all false  theories
 and practices.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error only ephemeral</font></p>
 Question. - Is materiality the concomitant of spirituality, and is material sense a necessary preliminary to
 the understanding and expression of Spirit?
 <p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_485"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 485</font></a></p><p></p><p>Answer.--If error is necessary to define or to reveal 
 Truth, the answer is yes; but not otherwise. Material
 sense is an absurd phrase, for matter has no 
 sensation. Science declares that Mind, not 
 matter, sees, hears, feels, speaks. Whatever contradicts
 this statement is the false sense, which ever betrays 
 mortals into sickness, sin, and death. If the unimportant and evil appear, only soon to disappear because
 of their uselessness or their iniquity, then these ephemeral views of error ought to be obliterated by Truth.
 Why malign Christian Science for instructing mortals how
 to make sin, disease, and death appear more and more 
 unreal?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific translations</font></p>
 Emerge gently from matter into Spirit. Think not
 to thwart the spiritual ultimate of all things, but come 
 naturally into Spirit through better health and 
 morals and as the result of spiritual growth.  
 Not death, but the understanding of Life, makes man immortal. The belief that life can be in matter or soul in
 body, and that man springs from dust or from an egg,
 is the result of the mortal error which Christ, or Truth, 
 destroys by fulfilling the spiritual law of being, in which
 man is perfect, even as the "Father which is in heaven
 is perfect." If thought yields its dominion to other  ' 
 powers, it cannot outline on the body its own beautiful
 images, but it effaces them and delineates foreign agents,
 called disease and sin.        
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material beliefs</font></p>
 The heathen gods of mythology controlled war and
 agriculture as much as nerves control sensation or
 muscles measure strength.  To say that 
 strength is in matter, is like saying that the 
 power is in the lever. The notion of any life or intelli<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_486"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 486</font></a></p><p></p><p>gence in matter is without foundation in fact, and you
 can have no faith in falsehood when you have learned
 falsehood's true nature.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sense versus Soul</font></p>
 Suppose one accident happens to the eye, another to
 the ear, and so on, until every corporeal sense is quenched.
 What is man's remedy? To die, that he may
 regain these senses? Even then he must gain
 spiritual understanding and spiritual sense in order to
 possess immortal consciousness. Earth's preparatory 
 school must be improved to the utmost. In reality man
 never dies. The belief that he dies will not establish his
 scientific harmony. Death is not the result of Truth but
 of error, and one error will not correct another.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Death an error</font></p>
 Jesus proved by the prints of the nails, that his body
 was the same immediately after death as before. If death
 restores sight, sound, and strength to man,
 then death is not an enemy but a better friend
 than Life. Alas for the blindness of belief, which makes
 harmony conditional upon death and matter, and yet
 supposes Mind unable to produce harmony! So long
 as this error of belief remains, mortals will continue mortal in belief and subject to chance and change.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Permanent sensibility</font></p>
 Sight, hearing, all the spiritual senses of man, are
 eternal. They cannot be lost. Their reality and immortality are in Spirit and understanding, not in
 matter,--hence their permanence. If this
 were not so, man would be speedily annihilated. If the
 five corporeal senses were the medium through which
 to understand God, then palsy, blindness, and deafness
 would place man in a terrible situation, where he would
 be like those "having no hope, and without God in the
 world;" but as a matter of fact, these calamities often
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_487"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 487</font></a></p><p></p><p>drive mortals to seek and to find a higher sense of happiness and existence.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Exercise of Mind-faculties</font></p>
 Life is deathless. Life is the origin and ultimate of 
 man, never attainable through death, but gained by walking in the pathway of Truth both before and 
 after that which is called death. There is more 
 Christianity in seeing and hearing spiritually
 than materially. There is more Science in the perpetual
 exercise of the Mind-faculties than in their loss. Lost 
 they cannot be, while Mind remains. The apprehension
 of this gave sight to the blind and hearing to the deaf centuries ago, and it will repeat the wonder.    
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Understanding versus belief</font></p>
 Question.--You speak of belief. Who or what is it
 that believes?
 Answer.--Spirit is all-knowing; this precludes the
 need of believing. Matter cannot believe, and Mind
 understands. The body cannot believe. The 
 believer and belief are one and are mortal. 
 Christian evidence is founded on Science or 
 demonstrable Truth, flowing from immortal Mind, and
 there is in reality no such thing as mortal mind. Mere 
 belief is blindness without Principle from which to explain the reason of its hope. The belief that life is sentient and intelligent matter is erroneous.    
 <p></p><p>The Apostle James said, "Show me thy faith without
 thy works, and I will show thee my faith by my works."
 The understanding that Life is God, Spirit, lengthens 
 our days by strengthening our trust in the deathless
 reality of Life, its almightiness and immortality.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Confirmation by healing</font></p>
 This faith relies upon an understood Principle. This 
 Principle makes whole the diseased, and brings out the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_488"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 488</font></a></p><p></p><p>enduring and harmonious phases of things. The result
 of our teachings is their sufficient confirmation. When,
 on the strength of these instructions, you are
 able to banish a severe malady, the cure shows
 that you understand this teaching, and therefore you receive the blessing of Truth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Belief and firm trust</font></p>
 The Hebrew and Greek words often translated belief
 differ somewhat in meaning from that conveyed by the
 English verb believe; they have more the significance of faith, understanding, trust, constancy, firmness. Hence the Scriptures often appear in
 our common version to approve and endorse belief, when
 they mean to enforce the necessity of understanding.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">All faculties from Mind</font></p>
 Question.--Do the five corporeal senses constitute
 man?
 Answer.--Christian Science sustains with immortal
 proof the impossibility of any material sense, and defines
 these so-called senses as mortal beliefs, the
 testimony of which cannot be true either of
 man or of his Maker. The corporeal senses can take no
 cognizance of spiritual reality and immortality. Nerves
 have no more sensation, apart from what belief bestows upon them, than the fibres of a plant. Mind alone
 possesses all faculties, perception, and comprehension.
 Therefore mental endowments are not at the mercy of
 organization and decomposition,--otherwise the very
 worms could unfashion man. If it were possible for the
 real senses of man to be injured, Soul could reproduce
 them in all their perfection; but they cannot be disturbed nor destroyed, since they exist in immortal Mind,
 not in matter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_489"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 489</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Possibilities of Life</font></p>
 The less mind there is manifested in matter the better. 
 When the unthinking lobster loses its claw, the claw grows
 again. If the Science of Life were understood, 
 it would be found that the senses of Mind are 
 never lost and that matter has no sensation. Then the
 human limb would be replaced as readily as the lobster's 
 claw,--not with an artificial limb, but with the genuine
 one. Any hypothesis which supposes life to be in matter
 is an educated belief. In infancy this belief is not equal 
 to guiding the hand to the mouth; and as consciousness
 develops, this belief goes out,--yields to the reality of
 everlasting Life.     
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Decalogue disregarded</font></p>
 Corporeal sense defrauds and lies; it breaks all the
 commands of the Mosaic Decalogue to meet its own demands. How then can this sense be the Godgiven channel to man of divine blessings or  
 understanding? How can man, reflecting God, be dependent on material means for knowing, hearing, seeing? 
 Who dares to say that the senses of man can be at one time
 the medium for sinning against God, at another the medium for obeying God? An affirmative reply would contradict the Scripture, for the same fountain sendeth not
 forth sweet waters and bitter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Organic construction valueless</font></p>
 The corporeal senses are the only source  of evil or 
 error. Christian Science shows them to be  false, because matter has no sensation, and no organic 
 construction can give it hearing and sight nor 
 make it the medium of Mind. Outside the  
 material sense of things, all is harmony. A wrong sense
 of God, man, and creation is non-sense, want of sense. 
 Mortal belief would have the material senses sometimes
 good and sometimes bad. It assures mortals that there
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_490"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 490</font></a></p><p></p><p>is real pleasure in sin; but the grand truths of Christian
 Science dispute this error.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Will-power an animal propensity</font></p>
 Will-power is but a product of belief, and this belief
 commits depredations on harmony. Human will is an
 animal propensity, not a faculty of Soul.
 Hence it cannot govern man aright. Christian Science reveals Truth and Love as the
 motive-powers of man. Will - blind, stubborn, and headlong--cooperates with appetite and passion. From this
 cooperation arises its evil. From this also comes its powerlessness, since all power belongs to God, good.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Theories helpless</font></p>
 The Science of Mind needs to be understood. Until
 it is understood, mortals are more or less deprived of
 Truth. Human theories are helpless to make
 man harmonious or immortal, since he is so
 already, according to Christian Science. Our only need
 is to know this and reduce to practice the real man's divine Principle, Love
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True nature and origin</font></p>
 "Quench not the Spirit. Despise not prophesyings."
 Human belief--or knowledge gained from the so-called
 material senses - would, by fair logic, annihilate man along with the dissolving elements
 of clay. The scientifically Christian explanations of the
 nature and origin of man destroy all material sense with
 immortal testimony. This immortal testimony ushers
 in the spiritual sense of being, which can be obtained
 in no other way.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Sleep an illusion</font></p>
 Sleep and mesmerism explain the mythical nature of
 material sense. Sleep shows material sense as either
 oblivion, nothingness, or an illusion or dream.
 Under the mesmeric illusion of belief, a man
 will think that he is freezing when he is warm, and that he
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_491"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 491</font></a></p><p></p><p>is swimming when he is on dry land. Needle-thrusts will 
 not hurt him. A delicious perfume will seem intolerable.
 Animal magnetism thus uncovers material sense, and 
 shows it to be a belief without actual foundation or validity. Change the belief, and the sensation changes.
 Destroy the belief, and the sensation disappears.   
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man linked with Spirit</font></p>
 Material man is made up of involuntary and voluntary
 error, of a negative right and a positive wrong,  the latter
 calling itself right. Man's spiritual individuality is never wrong. It is the likeness of man's 
 Maker. Matter cannot connect mortals with the true
 origin and facts of being, in which all must end. It is only 
 by acknowledging the supremacy of Spirit, which annuls
 the claims of matter, that mortals can lay off mortality and
 find the indissoluble spiritual link which establishes man 
 forever in the divine likeness, inseparable from his creator.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material man as a dream</font></p>
 The belief that matter and mind are one, - that matter is awake at one time and asleep at another, sometimes presenting no appearance of mind, this belief culminates in another belief, that 
 man dies. Science reveals material man as never the real 
 being. The dream or belief goes on, whether our eyes are
 closed or open. In sleep, memory and consciousness are
 lost from the body, and they wander whither they will 
 apparently with their own separate embodiment. Personality is not the individuality of man. A wicked man
 may have an attractive personality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual existence the one fact</font></p>
 When we are awake, we dream of the pains  and pleasures of matter. Who will say, even though he 
 does not understand Christian Science, that 
 this dream--rather than the dreamer--may 
 not be mortal man? Who can rationally say otherwise,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_492"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 492</font></a></p><p>when the dream leaves mortal man intact in body and
 thought, although the so-called dreamer is unconscious?
 For right reasoning there should be but one fact before
 the thought, namely, spiritual existence. In reality there
 is no other existence, since Life cannot be united to its
 unlikeness, mortality.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind one and all</font></p>
 Being is holiness, harmony, immortality. It is already
 proved that a knowledge of this, even in small degree,
 will uplift the physical and moral standard
 of mortals, will increase longevity, will purify
 and elevate character. Thus progress will finally destroy
 all error, and bring immortality to light. We know that
 a statement proved to be good must be correct. New
 thoughts are constantly obtaining the floor. These two
 contradictory theories--that matter is something, or
 that all is Mind--will dispute the ground, until one is
 acknowledged to be the victor. Discussing his campaign, General Grant said: "I propose to fight it out on
 this line, if it takes all summer." Science says: All is
 Mind and Mind's idea. You must fight it out on this
 line. Matter can afford you no aid.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific ultimatum</font></p>
 The notion that mind and matter commingle in the
 human illusion as to sin, sickness, and death must eventually submit to the Science of Mind, which
 denies this notion. God is Mind, and God is
 infinite; hence all is Mind. On this statement rests the
 Science of being, and the Principle of this Science is divine, demonstrating harmony and immortality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Victory for Truth</font></p>
 The conservative theory, long believed, is that there
 are two factors, matter and mind, uniting on some impossible basis. This theory would keep truth and error
 always at war. Victory would perch on neither banner.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_493"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 493</font></a></p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Christian Science speedily shows 
 Truth to be triumphant. To corporeal sense, the sun
 appears to rise and set, and the earth to stand 
 still; but astronomical science contradicts this, 
 and explains the solar system as working on a different plan. All the evidence of physical sense and all the 
 knowledge obtained from physical sense must yield to
 Science, to the immortal truth of all things.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental preparation</font></p>
 Question,--Will you explain sickness and show how it 
 is to be healed?
 Answer. - The method of Christian Science Mind-healing is touched upon in a previous chapter entitled Christian 
 Science Practice. A full answer to the above 
 question involves teaching, which enables the  
 healer to demonstrate and prove for himself the Principle 
 and rule of Christian Science or metaphysical healing.
 <p></p><p><font size="1">Mind destroys all ills</font></p>
 Mind must be found superior to all the beliefs of the
 five corporeal senses, and able to destroy all ills. Sickness is a belief, which must be annihilated by 
 the divine Mind. Disease is an experience of 
 so-called mortal mind. It is fear made manifest on the 
 body. Christian Science takes away this physical sense
 of discord, just as it removes any other sense of moral or
 mental inharmony. That man is material, and that matter suffers,--these propositions can only seem real and
 natural in illusion. Any sense of soul in matter is not the
 reality of being.    
       
 If Jesus awakened Lazarus from the dream, illusion, of
 death, this proved that the Christ could improve on a false
 sense. Who dares to doubt this consummate test of the 
 power and willingness of divine Mind to hold man forever
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_494"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 494</font></a></p><p></p><p>intact in his perfect state, and to govern man's entire
 action? Jesus said: "Destroy this temple [body], and
 in three days I [Mind] will raise it up;" and he did this
 for tired humanity's reassurance.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Inexhaustible divine Love</font></p>
 Is it not a species of infidelity to believe that so great
 a work as the Messiah's was done for himself or for God,
 who needed no help from Jesus' example to
 preserve the eternal harmony? But mortals
 did need this help, and Jesus pointed the way for them.
 Divine Love always has met and always will meet every
 human need. It is not well to imagine that Jesus demonstrated the divine power to heal only for a select number
 or for a limited period of time, since to all mankind and
 in every hour, divine Love supplies all good.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reason and Science</font></p>
 The miracle of grace is no miracle to Love. Jesus
 demonstrated the inability of corporeality, as well as the
 infinite ability of Spirit, thus helping erring
 human sense to flee from its own convictions
 and seek safety in divine Science. Reason, rightly directed, serves to correct the errors of corporeal sense; but
 sin, sickness, and death will seem real (even as the experiences of the sleeping dream seem real) until the Science of man's eternal harmony breaks their illusion with
 the unbroken reality of scientific being.
 <p></p><p>Which of these two theories concerning man are you
 ready to accept? One is the mortal testimony, changing,
 dying, unreal. The other is the eternal and real evidence,
 bearing Truth's signet, its lap piled high with immortal
 fruits.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Followers of Jesus</font></p>
 Our Master cast out devils (evils) and healed the sick.
 It should be said of his followers also, that they cast fear
 and all evil out of themselves and others and heal the sick.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_495"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 495</font></a></p><p></p><p>God will heal the sick through man, whenever man is 
 governed by God. Truth casts out error now 
 as surely as it did nineteen centuries ago. All 
 of Truth is not understood; hence its healing power is not
 fully demonstrated.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Destruction of all evil</font></p>
 If sickness is true or the idea of Truth, you cannot 
 destroy sickness, and it would be absurd to try. Then
 classify sickness and error as our Master did, 
 when he spoke of the sick, "whom Satan hath 
 bound," and find a sovereign antidote for error in the lifegiving power of Truth acting on human belief, a power
 which opens the prison doors to such as are bound, and 
 sets the captive free physically and morally.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Steadfast and calm trust</font></p>
 When the illusion of sickness or sin tempts you, cling
 steadfastly to God and His idea. Allow nothing but His 
 likeness to abide in your thought. Let neither 
 fear nor doubt overshadow your clear sense and
 calm trust, that the recognition of life harmonious--as 
 Life eternally is--can destroy any painful sense of, or
 belief in, that which Life is not. Let Christian Science,
 instead of corporeal sense, support your understanding of 
 being, and this understanding will supplant error with
 Truth, replace mortality with immortality, and silence discord with harmony.          
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Rudiments and growth</font></p>
 Question.--How can I progress most rapidly in the
 understanding of Christian Science?
 Answer.--Study thoroughly the letter and imbibe 
 the spirit. Adhere to the divine Principle of Christian Science and follow the behests of God, 
 abiding steadfastly in wisdom, Truth, and
 Love. In the Science of Mind, you will soon ascertain
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_496"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 496</font></a></p><p></p><p>that error cannot destroy error. You will also learn
 that in Science there is no transfer of evil suggestions
 from one mortal to another, for there is but one Mind,
 and this ever-present omnipotent Mind is reflected by
 man and governs the entire universe. You will learn
 that in Christian Science the first duty is to obey
 God, to have one Mind, and to love another as
 yourself.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Condition of progress</font></p>
 We all must learn that Life is God. Ask yourself:
 Am I living the life that approaches the supreme good?
 Am I demonstrating the healing power of
 Truth and Love? If so then the way will
 grow brighter "unto the perfect day." Your fruits
 will prove what the understanding of God brings to man.
 Hold perpetually this thought,--that it is the spiritual
 idea, the Holy Ghost and Christ, which enables you to
 demonstrate, with scientific certainty, the rule of healing,
 based upon its divine Principle, Love, underlying, overlying, and encompassing all true being.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Triumph over death</font></p>
 "The sting of death is sin; and the strength of sin is
 the law,"--the law of mortal belief, at war with the
 facts of immortal Life, even with the spiritual
 law which says to the grave, "Where is thy
 victory?" But "when this corruptible shall have put
 on incorruption, and this mortal shall have put on immortality, then shall be brought to pass the saying that
 is written, Death is swallowed up in victory."
 <p></p><p>Question.--Have Christian Scientists any religious
 creed?
 Answer.--They have not, if by that term is meant
 doctrinal beliefs. The following is a brief exposition of
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_497"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 497</font></a></p><p></p><p>the important points, or religious tenets, of Christian 
 Science: 1. As adherents of Truth, we take the inspired Word 
 of the Bible as our sufficient guide to eternal Life.
 2. We acknowledge and adore one supreme and infinite God. We acknowledge His Son, one Christ; the 
 Holy Ghost or divine Comforter; and man in God's
 image and likeness.
 3. We acknowledge God's forgiveness of sin in the 
 destruction of sin and the spiritual understanding that
 casts out evil as unreal. But the belief in sin is punished so long as the belief lasts.      
 4. We acknowledge Jesus' atonement as the evidence of divine, efficacious Love, unfolding man's unity
 with God through Christ Jesus the Way-shower; and 
 we acknowledge that man is saved through Christ,
 through Truth, Life, and Love as demonstrated by the
 Galilean Prophet in healing the sick and overcoming 
 sin and death.
 5. We acknowledge that the crucifixion of Jesus and
 his resurrection served to uplift faith to understand eternal Life, even the allness of Soul, Spirit, and the nothingness of matter.
 6. And we solemnly promise to watch, and pray for 
 that Mind to be in us which was also in Christ Jesus; to
 do unto others as we would have them do unto us; and
 to be merciful, just, and pure.

 <p></p><p>These things saith He that is holy, He that is true, He that hath the key of David, He that openeth, and no man shutteth; and shutteth, and no man openeth; I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door, and no man can shut it.--REVELATION.
