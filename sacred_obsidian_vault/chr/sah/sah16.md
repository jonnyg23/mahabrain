 <h1 align="CENTER">Chapter XVI - The Apocalypse</h1>
 <p></p><p><a name="pg_558"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 558</font></a></p><p>Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy, and keep those things which are written therein: for the time is at
 hand.--REVELATION.
 </p><p>Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised in the city of our God,
 in the mountain of His holiness.--PSALMS.
 </p><p></p><p>ST. JOHN writes, in the tenth chapter of his book of
 Revelation : </p><p></p><p>And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven,
 clothed with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and
 his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of
 fire: and he had in his hand a little book open: and he
 set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the
 earth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The new Evangel</font></p>
 This angel or message which comes from God, clothed
 with a cloud, prefigures divine Science. To mortal sense
 Science seems at first obscure, abstract, and
 dark; but a bright promise crowns its brow.
 When understood, it is Truth's prism and praise. When
 you look it fairly in the face, you can heal by its means,
 and it has for you a light above the sun, for God "is the
 light thereof." Its feet are pillars of fire, foundations
 of Truth and Love. It brings the baptism of the Holy
 Ghost, whose flames of Truth were prophetically described by John the Baptist as consuming error.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_559"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 559</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Truth's volume</font></p>
 This angel had in his hand "a little book," open for 
 all to read and understand. Did this same book contain
 the revelation of divine Science, the "right 
 foot" or dominant power of which was upon 
 the sea,--upon elementary, latent error, the source of
 all error's visible forms? The angel's left foot was upon 
 the earth; that is, a secondary power was exercised upon
 visible error and audible sin. The "still, small voice"
 of scientific thought reaches over continent and ocean 
 to the globe's remotest bound. The inaudible voice of
 Truth is, to the human mind, "as when a lion roareth."
 It is heard in the desert and in dark places of fear. It 
 arouses the "seven thunders" of evil, and stirs their latent
 forces to utter the full diapason of secret tones. Then is
 the power of Truth demonstrated,--made manifest in
 the destruction of error. Then will a voice from harmony
 cry: "Go and take the little book. . . . Take it, and eat
 it up; and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in 
 thy mouth sweet as honey." Mortals, obey the heavenly
 evangel. Take divine Science. Read this book from
 beginning to end. Study it, ponder it. It will be indeed 
 sweet at its first taste, when it heals you; but murmur not
 over Truth, if you find its digestion bitter. When you
 approach nearer and nearer to this divine Principle, when 
 you eat the divine body of this Principle, - thus partaking of the nature, or primal elements, of Truth and Love,
 - do not be surprised nor discontented because you must 
 share the hemlock cup and eat the bitter herbs; for the
 Israelites of old at the Paschal meal thus prefigured this
 perilous passage out of bondage into the El Dorado of faith 
 and hope.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">To-day's lesson</font></p>
 The twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse, or Revela<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_560"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 560</font></a></p><p></p><p>tion of St. John, has a special suggestiveness in connection with the nineteenth century. In the opening of the
 sixth seal, typical of six thousand years since
 Adam, the distinctive feature has reference
 to the present age.
 </p><p></p><p>Revelation xii. 1. And there appeared a great wonder in
 heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon
 under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve
 stars.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True estimate of God's messenger</font></p>
 Heaven represents harmony, and divine Science interprets the Principle of heavenly harmony. The great
 miracle, to human sense, is divine Love, and
 the grand necessity of existence is to gain the
 true idea of what constitutes the kingdom of
 heaven in man. This goal is never reached while we
 hate our neighbor or entertain a false estimate of anyone whom God has appointed to voice His Word. Again,
 without a correct sense of its highest visible idea, we can
 never understand the divine Principle. The botanist must
 know the genus and species of a plant in order to classify
 it correctly. As it is with things, so is it with persons.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Persecution harmful</font></p>
 Abuse of the motives and religion of St. Paul hid from
 view the apostle's character, which made him equal to
 his great mission. Persecution of all who have
 spoken something new and better of God has
 not only obscured the light of the ages, but has been fatal
 to the persecutors. Why? Because it has hid from
 them the true idea which has been presented. To misunderstand Paul, was to be ignorant of the divine idea he
 taught. Ignorance of the divine idea betrays at once a
 greater ignorance of the divine Principle of the idea - igno<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_561"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 561</font></a></p><p></p><p>rance of Truth and Love. The understanding of Truth 
 and Love, the Principle which works out the ends of eternal
 good and destroys both faith in evil and the practice of 
 evil, leads to the discernment of the divine idea.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Espousals supernal</font></p>
 Agassiz, through his microscope, saw the sun in an
 egg at a point of so-called embryonic life. Because of
 his more spiritual vision, St. John saw an 
 "angel standing in the sun." The Revelator 
 beheld the spiritual idea from the mount of vision. 
 Purity was the symbol of Life and Love. The Revelator
 saw also the spiritual ideal as a woman clothed in light, a
 bride coming down from heaven, wedded to the Lamb 
 of Love. To John, "the bride" and "the Lamb" represented the correlation of divine Principle and spiritual idea,
 God and His Christ, bringing harmony to earth. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divinity and humanity </font></p>
 John saw the human and divine coincidence, shown in
 the man Jesus, as divinity embracing humanity in Life
 and its demonstration,--reducing to human 
 perception and understanding the Life which 
 is God. In divine revelation, material and corporeal selfhood disappear, and the spiritual idea is understood. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual sunlight </font></p>
 The woman in the Apocalypse symbolizes generic man,
 the spiritual idea of God; she illustrates the coincidence
 of God and man as the divine Principle and 
 divine idea. The Revelator symbolizes Spirit 
 by the sun. The spiritual idea is clad with the radiance
 of spiritual Truth, and matter is put under her feet. The 
 light portrayed is really neither solar nor lunar, but spiritual Life, which is "the light of men." In the first chapter
 of the Fourth Gospel it is written, "There was a man sent 
 from God . . . to bear witness of that Light."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual idea revealed</font></p>
 John the Baptist prophesied the coming of the im<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_562%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 562 </font></a></p><p></p><p>maculate Jesus, and John saw in those days the spiritual
 idea as the Messiah, who would baptize with the Holy
 Ghost,--divine Science. As Elias presented
 the idea of the fatherhood of God, which Jesus
 afterwards manifested, so the Revelator completed this
 figure with woman, typifying the spiritual idea of God's
 motherhood. The moon is under her feet. This idea
 reveals the universe as secondary and tributary to Spirit,
 from which the universe borrows its reflected light, substance, life, and intelligence.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual idea crowned</font></p>
 The spiritual idea is crowned with twelve stars. The
 twelve tribes of Israel with all mortals,--separated by
 belief from man's divine origin and the true
 idea,--will through much tribulation yield to
 the activities of the divine Principle of man in the harmony of Science. These are the stars in the crown of
 rejoicing. They are the lamps in the spiritual heavens
 of the age, which show the workings of the spiritual idea
 by healing the sick and the sinning, and by manifesting
 the light which shines "unto the perfect day" as the night
 of materialism wanes.
 <p></p><p>Revelation xii. 2. And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and pained to be delivered.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Travail and joy</font></p>
 Also the spiritual idea is typified by a woman in travail, waiting to be delivered of her sweet promise, but remembering no more her sorrow for joy that
 the birth goes on; for great is the idea, and the
 travail portentous.
 <p></p><p>Revelation xii. 3. And there appeared another wonder in
 heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads
 and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_563"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 563</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The dragon as a type</font></p>
 Human sense may well marvel at discord, while, to a 
 diviner sense., harmony is the real and discord the unreal.
 We may well be astonished at sin, sickness, and 
 death. We may well be perplexed at human 
 fear; and still more astounded at hatred, which lifts
 its hydra head, showing its horns in the many inventions 
 of evil. But why should we stand aghast at nothingness?
 The great red dragon symbolizes a lie,--the belief
 that substance, life, and intelligence can be material. 
 This dragon stands for the sum total of human error.
 The ten horns of the dragon typify the belief that matter has power of its own, and that by means of an 
 evil mind in matter the Ten Commandments can be
 broken.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The sting of the serpent</font></p>
 The Revelator lifts the veil from this embodiment of 
 all evil, and beholds its awful character; but he also
 sees the nothingness of evil and the allness of 
 God. The Revelator sees that old serpent, 
 whose name is devil or evil, holding untiring watch, that
 he may bite the heel of truth and seemingly impede the
 offspring of the spiritual idea, which is prolific in health, 
 holiness, and immortality.
 <p></p><p>Revelation xii. 4. And his tail drew the third part of the
 stars of heaven, and did cast them to the earth: and the 
 dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be
 delivered, for to devour her child as soon as it was born.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Animal tendency</font></p>
 The serpentine form stands for subtlety, winding its 
 way amidst all evil, but doing this in the name of good.
 Its sting is spoken of by Paul, when he refers 
 to "spiritual wickedness in high places." It 
 is the animal instinct in mortals, which would impel
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_564"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 564</font></a></p><p></p><p>them to devour each other and cast out devils through
 Beelzebub.
 </p><p></p><p>As of old, evil still charges the spiritual idea with error's
 own nature and methods. This malicious animal instinct, of which the dragon is the type, incites mortals to
 kill morally and physically even their fellow-mortals, and
 worse still, to charge the innocent with the crime. This
 last infirmity of sin will sink its perpetrator into a night
 without a star.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Malicious barbarity</font></p>
 The author is convinced that the accusations against
 Jesus of Nazareth and even his crucifixion were instigated
 by the criminal instinct here described. The
 Revelator speaks of Jesus as the Lamb of God
 and of the dragon as warring against innocence. Since Jesus
 must have been tempted in all points, he, the immaculate,
 met and conquered sin in every form. The brutal barbarity of his foes could emanate from no source except the
 highest degree of human depravity. Jesus "opened not
 his mouth." Until the majesty of Truth should be demonstrated in divine Science, the spiritual idea was arraigned
 before the tribunal of so-called mortal mind, which was
 unloosed in order that the false claim of mind in matter
 might uncover its own crime of defying immortal Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Doom of the dragon</font></p>
 From Genesis to the Apocalypse, sin, sickness, and
 death, envy, hatred, and revenge, - all evil, - are typified by a serpent, or animal subtlety. Jesus
 said, quoting a line from the Psalms, "They
 hated me without a cause." The serpent is perpetually
 close upon the heel of harmony. From the beginning
 to the end, the serpent pursues with hatred the spiritual
 idea. In Genesis, this allegorical, talking serpent typifies mortal mind, "more subtle than any beast of the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_565"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 565</font></a></p><p></p><p>field." In the Apocalypse, when nearing its doom, this 
 evil increases and becomes the great red dragon, swollen
 with sin, inflamed with war against spirituality, and ripe 
 for destruction. It is full of lust and hate, loathing the
 brightness of divine glory.
 </p><p></p><p>Revelation xii. 5. And she brought forth a man child, 
 who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her
 child was caught up unto God, and to His throne.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The conflict with purity</font></p>
 Led on by the grossest element of mortal mind, Herod 
 decreed the death of every male child in order that the
 man Jesus, the masculine representative of the 
 spiritual idea might never hold sway and deprive Herod of his crown.  The impersonation of the
 spiritual idea had a brief history in the earthly life of our
 Master; but "of his kingdom there shall be no end," 
 for Christ, God's idea, will eventually rule all nations
 and peoples - imperatively, absolutely, finally - with divine Science. This immaculate idea, represented first 
 by man and, according to the Revelator, last by woman,
 will baptize with fire; and the fiery baptism will burn up
 the chaff of error with the fervent heat of Truth and Love, 
 melting and purifying even the gold of human character.
 After the stars sang together and all was primeval harmony, the material lie made war upon the spiritual idea; 
 but this only impelled the idea to rise to the zenith of
 demonstration, destroying sin, sickness, and death, and
 to be caught up unto God,--to be found in its divine
 Principle.
 <p></p><p>Revelation xii. 6. And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place prepared of God.  
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_566%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 566 </font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual guidance</font></p>
 As the children of Israel were guided triumphantly
 through the Red Sea, the dark ebbing and flowing tides
 of human fear,--as they were led through the
 wilderness, walking wearily through the great
 desert of human hopes, and anticipating the promised
 joy,--so shall the spiritual idea guide all right desires
 in their passage from sense to Soul, from a material sense
 of existence to the spiritual, up to the glory prepared for
 them who love God. Stately Science pauses not, but
 moves before them, a pillar of cloud by day and of fire
 by night, leading to divine heights.
 <p></p><p>If we remember the beautiful description which Sir
 Walter Scott puts into the mouth of Rebecca the Jewess
 in the story of Ivanhoe, </p><p></p><p>   When Israel, of the Lord beloved,<br>
       Out of the land of bondage came,<br>
    Her fathers' God before her moved,<br>
       An awful guide, in smoke and flame, -<br>
 </p><p></p><p>we may also offer the prayer which concludes the same
 hymn, </p><p></p><p>   And oh, when stoops on Judah's path<br>
       In shade and storm the frequent night,<br>
    Be Thou, longsuffering, slow to wrath,<br>
       A burning and a shining light!<br>
 </p><p></p><p>Revelation xii. 7, 8. And there was war in heaven:
 Michael and his angels fought against the dragon; and the
 dragon fought, and his angels, and prevailed not; neither
 was their place found any more in heaven.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Angelic offices</font></p>
 The Old Testament assigns to the angels, God's divine
 messages, different offices. Michael's characteristic is spiritual strength. He leads the
 hosts of heaven against the power of sin, Satan, and
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_567"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 567</font></a></p><p></p><p>fights the holy wars. Gabriel has the more quiet task 
 of imparting a sense of the ever-presence of ministering
 Love. These angels deliver us from the depths. Truth 
 and Love come nearer in the hour of woe, when strong
 faith or spiritual strength wrestles and prevails through
 the understanding of God. The Gabriel of His presence 
 has no contests. To infinite, ever-present Love, all is
 Love, and there is no error, no sin, sickness, nor death.
 Against Love, the dragon warreth not long, for he is 
 killed by the divine Principle. Truth and Love prevail
 against the dragon because the dragon cannot war with
 them. Thus endeth the conflict between the flesh and 
 Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p>Revelation xii. 9. And the great dragon was cast out,
 that old serpent, called the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was cast out into the earth, and his
 angels were cast out with him.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Dragon cast down to earth</font></p>
 That false claim--that ancient belief, that old serpent 
 whose name is devil (evil), claiming that there is intelligence in matter either to benefit or to injure 
 men--is pure delusion, the red dragon; and 
 it is cast out by Christ, Truth, the spiritual 
 idea, and so proved to be powerless. The words "cast
 unto the earth" show the dragon to be nothingness, dust
 to dust; and therefore, in his pretence of being a talker,
 he must be a lie from the beginning. His angels, or messages, are cast out with their author. The beast and the 
 false prophets are lust and hypocrisy. These wolves in
 sheep's clothing are detected and killed by innocence, the
 Lamb of Love.  
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Warfare with error    </font></p>
 Divine Science shows how the Lamb slays the wolf.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_568"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 568</font></a></p><p></p><p>Innocence and Truth overcome guilt and error. Ever
 since the foundation of the world, ever since error would
 establish material belief, evil has tried to slay
 the Lamb; but Science is able to destroy this
 lie, called evil. The twelfth chapter of the Apocalypse
 typifies the divine method of warfare in Science, and the
 glorious results of this warfare. The following chapters
 depict the fatal effects of trying to meet error with error.
 The narrative follows the order used in Genesis. In
 Genesis, first the true method of creation is set forth and
 then the false. Here, also, the Revelator first exhibits
 the true warfare and then the false.
 </p><p></p><p>Revelation xii. 10--12. And I heard a loud voice saying
 in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the
 kingdom of our God, and the power of His Christ: for the
 accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them
 before our God day and night. And they overcame him by
 the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony;
 and they loved not their lives unto the death. Therefore
 rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the
 inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil is
 come down unto you, having great wrath, because he
 knoweth that he hath but a short time.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Paean of jubilee</font></p>
 For victory over a single sin, we give thanks and magnify the Lord of Hosts. What shall we say of the mighty
 conquest over all sin? A louder song, sweeter
 than has ever before reached high heaven,
 now rises clearer and nearer to the great heart of Christ;
 for the accuser is not there, and Love sends forth her
 primal and everlasting strain. Self-abnegation, by which
 we lay down all for Truth, or Christ, in our warfare against
 error, is a rule in Christian Science. This rule clearly
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_569"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 569</font></a></p><p></p><p>interprets God as divine Principle,--as Life, represented 
 by the Father; as Truth, represented by the Son; as Love,
 represented by the Mother. Every mortal at some period, 
 here or hereafter, must grapple with and overcome the
 mortal belief in a power opposed to God.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The robe of Science</font></p>
 The Scripture, "Thou hast been faithful over a few 
 things, I will make thee ruler over many," is literally fulfilled, when we are conscious of the supremacy 
 of Truth, by which the nothingness of error 
 is seen; and we know that the nothingness of error is in
 proportion to its wickedness. He that touches the hem
 of Christ's robe and masters his mortal beliefs, animality, 
 and hate, rejoices in the proof of healing,--in a sweet
 and certain sense that God is Love. Alas for those who
 break faith with divine Science and fail to strangle the 
 serpent of sin as well as of sickness! They are dwellers
 still in the deep darkness of belief. They are in the surging sea of error, not struggling to lift their heads above the 
 drowning wave.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Expiation by suffering</font></p>
 What must the end be? They must eventually expiate their sin through suffering. The sin, which one has 
 made his bosom companion, comes back to him 
 at last with accelerated force, for the devil
 knoweth his time is short. Here the Scriptures declare
 that evil is temporal, not eternal. The dragon is at last
 stung to death by his own malice; but how many periods
 of torture it may take to remove all sin, must depend upon 
 sin's obduracy.
 <p></p><p>Revelation xii. 13. And when the dragon saw that he
 was cast unto the earth, he persecuted the woman which 
 brought forth the man child.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_570"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 570</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Apathy to occultism</font></p>
 The march of mind and of honest investigation will
 bring the hour when the people will chain, with fetters of
 some sort, the growing occultism of this period.
 The present apathy as to the tendency of
 certain active yet unseen mental agencies will finally be
 shocked into another extreme mortal mood,--into human
 indignation; for one extreme follows another.
 <p></p><p>Revelation xii. 15, 16. And the serpent cast out of his
 mouth water as a flood, after the woman, that he might
 cause her to be carried away of the flood. And the earth
 helped the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and
 swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of his
 mouth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Receptive hearts</font></p>
 Millions of unprejudiced minds--simple seekers for
 Truth, weary wanderers, athirst in the desert - are waiting and watching for rest and drink. Give
 them a cup of cold water in Christ's name,
 and never fear the consequences. What if the old dragon
 should send forth a new flood to drown the Christ-idea?
 He can neither drown your voice with its roar, nor again
 sink the world into the deep waters of chaos and old night.
 In this age the earth will help the woman; the spiritual
 idea will be understood. Those ready for the blessing
 you impart will give thanks. The waters will be pacified, and Christ will command the wave.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Hidden ways of iniquity</font></p>
 When God heals the sick or the sinning, they should
 know the great benefit which Mind has wrought. They
 should also know the great delusion of mortal mind, when it makes them sick or sinful.
 Many are willing to open the eyes of the people to the
 power of good resident in divine Mind, but they are
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_571"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 571</font></a></p><p></p><p>not so willing to point out the evil in human thought,
 and expose evil's hidden mental ways of accomplishing
 iniquity.   
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Christly warning   </font></p>
 Why this backwardness, since exposure is necessary
 to ensure the avoidance of the evil? Because people like
 you better when you tell them their virtues 
 than when you tell them their vices. It requires the spirit of our blessed Master to tell a man his
 faults, and so risk human displeasure for the sake of doing
 right and benefiting our race. Who is telling mankind
 of the foe in ambush? Is the informer one who sees the
 foe? If so, listen and be wise. Escape from evil, and 
 designate those as unfaithful stewards who have seen the
 danger and yet have given no warning.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The armor of divinity</font></p>
 At all times and under all circumstances, overcome 
 evil with good. Know thyself, and God will supply
 the wisdom and the occasion for a victory 
 over evil. Clad in the panoply of Love, 
 human hatred cannot reach you. The cement of a
 higher humanity will unite all interests in the one
 divinity. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Pure religion enthroned      </font></p>
 Through trope and metaphor, the Revelator, immortal
 scribe of Spirit and of a true idealism, furnishes the
 mirror in which mortals may see their own 
 image. In significant figures he depicts the 
 thoughts which he beholds in mortal mind. Thus he
 rebukes the conceit of sin, and foreshadows  its doom. 
 With his spiritual strength, he has opened wide the gates
 of glory, and illumined the night of paganism with the
 sublime grandeur of divine Science, outshining sin, sorcery, 
 lust, and hypocrisy. He takes away mitre and sceptre.
 He enthrones pure and undefiled religion, and lifts on
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_572%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 572 </font></a></p><p></p><p>high only those who have washed their robes white in
 obedience and suffering.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Native nothingness of sin</font></p>
 Thus we see, in both the first and last books of the
 Bible,--in Genesis and in the Apocalypse,--that sin
 is to be Christianly and scientifically reduced
 to its native nothingness. "Love one another" (I John, iii. 23), is the most simple and profound
 counsel of the inspired writer. In Science we are children of God; but whatever is of material sense, or mortal, belongs not to His children, for materiality is the
 inverted image of spirituality.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fulfilment of the Law</font></p>
 Love fulfils the law of Christian Science, and nothing
 short of this divine Principle, understood and demonstrated, can ever furnish the vision of the
 Apocalypse, open the seven seals of error with
 Truth, or uncover the myriad illusions of sin, sickness,
 and death. Under the supremacy of Spirit, it will be seen
 and acknowledged that matter must disappear.
 <p></p><p>In Revelation xxi. 1 we read: </p><p></p><p>And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first
 heaven and the first earth were passed away; and there was
 no more sea.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man's present possibilities</font></p>
 The Revelator had not yet passed the transitional
 stage in human experience called death, but he already
 saw a new heaven and a new earth. Through
 what sense came this vision to St. John? Not
 through the material visual organs for seeing, for optics
 are inadequate to take in so wonderful a scene. Were this
 new heaven and new earth terrestrial or celestial, mate<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_573"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 573</font></a></p><p></p><p>rial or spiritual? They could not be the former, for the
 human sense of space is unable to grasp such a view.
 The Revelator was on our plane of existence, while yet
 beholding what the eye cannot see, - that which is invisible to the uninspired thought. This testimony of Holy
 Writ sustains the fact in Science, that the heavens and 
 earth to one human consciousness, that consciousness
 which God bestows, are spiritual, while to another, the
 unillumined human mind, the vision is material.  This
 shows unmistakably that what the human mind terms
 matter and spirit indicates states and stages of consciousness.   
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Nearness of Deity   </font></p>
 Accompanying this scientific consciousness was another revelation, even the declaration from heaven, supreme harmony, that God, the divine Principle 
 of harmony, is ever with men, and they are 
 His people. Thus man was no longer regarded as a miserable sinner, but as the blessed child of God. Why? 
 Because St. John's corporeal sense of the heavens and
 earth had vanished, and in place of this false sense was
 the spiritual sense, the subjective state by which he could 
 see the new heaven and new earth, which involve the
 spiritual idea and consciousness of reality. This is Scriptural authority for concluding that such a recognition of 
 being is, and has been, possible to men in this present
 state of existence,--that we can become conscious,
 here and now, of a cessation of death, sorrow, and pain. 
 This is indeed a foretaste of absolute Christian Science.
 Take heart, dear sufferer, for this reality of being will
 surely appear sometime and in some way. There will 
 be no more pain, and all tears will be wiped away. When
 you read this, remember Jesus' words, "The kingdom of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_574"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 574</font></a></p><p></p><p>God is within you." This spiritual consciousness is
 therefore a present possibility.
 </p><p></p><p>The Revelator also takes in another view, adapted to
 console the weary pilgrim, journeying " uphill all the way."
 </p><p></p><p>He writes, in Revelation xxi. 9: </p><p></p><p>And there came unto me one of the seven angels which
 had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked
 with me, saying, Come hither, I will show thee the bride,
 the Lamb's wife.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Vials of wrath and consolation</font></p>
 This ministry of Truth, this message from divine Love,
 carried John away in spirit. It exalted him till he became conscious of the spiritual facts of being
 and the "New Jerusalem, coming down from
 God, out of heaven," - the spiritual outpouring of bliss and glory, which he describes as the city
 which "lieth foursquare." The beauty of this text is,
 that the sum total of human misery, represented by
 the seven angelic vials full of seven plagues, has full
 compensation in the law of Love. Note this,--that the
 very message, or swift-winged thought, which poured
 forth hatred and torment, brought also the experience
 which at last lifted the seer to behold the great city, the
 four equal sides of which were heaven-bestowed and
 heaven-bestowing.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual wedlock</font></p>
 Think of this, dear reader, for it will lift the sackcloth from your eyes, and you will behold the softwinged dove descending upon you. The very
 circumstance, which your suffering sense
 deems wrathful and afflictive, Love can make an angel
 entertained unawares. Then thought gently whispers:
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_575"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 575</font></a></p><p></p><p>"Come hither! Arise from your false consciousness  
 into the true sense of Love, and behold the Lamb's
 wife,--Love wedded to its own spiritual idea." Then 
 cometh the marriage feast, for this revelation will destroy forever the physical plagues imposed by material
 sense. 
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The city foursquare      </font></p>
 This sacred city, described in the Apocalypse (xxi. 16)
 as one that "lieth foursquare" and cometh "down from
 God, out of heaven," represents the light and 
 glory of divine Science. The builder and 
 maker of this New Jerusalem is God, as we read in the
 book of Hebrews; and it is "a city which hath foundations." The description is metaphoric. Spiritual teaching must always be by symbols. Did not Jesus illustrate
 the truths he taught by the mustard-seed and the prodigal? Taken in its allegorical sense, the description of
 the city as foursquare has a profound meaning. The
 four sides of our city are the Word, Christ, Christianity, 
 and divine Science; "and the gates of it shall not be shut
 at all by day: for there shall be no night there." This
 city is wholly spiritual, as its four sides indicate. 
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The royally divine gates </font></p>
 As the Psalmist saith, "Beautiful for situation, the
 joy of the whole earth, is mount Zion, on the sides of
 the north, the city of the great King." It is 
 indeed a city of the Spirit, fair, royal, and 
 square. Northward, its gates open to the North Star,
 the Word, the polar magnet of Revelation; eastward, 
 to the star seen by the Wisemen of the Orient, who followed it to the manger of Jesus; southward, to the
 genial tropics, with the Southern Cross in the skies,
 - the Cross of Calvary, which binds human society
 into solemn union; westward, to the grand realization
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_576"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 576</font></a></p><p></p><p>of the Golden Shore of Love and the Peaceful Sea of
 Harmony.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Revelation's pure zenith</font></p>
 This heavenly city, lighted by the Sun of Righteousness,--this New Jerusalem, this infinite All, which to
 us seems hidden in the mist of remoteness, reached St. John's vision while yet he tabernacled with mortals.
 <p></p><p>In Revelation xxi. 22, further describing this holy city,
 the beloved Disciple writes: </p><p></p><p>And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty
 and the Lamb are the temple of it.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The shrine celestial</font></p>
 There was no temple,--that is, no material structure
 in which to worship God, for He must be worshipped
 in spirit and in love. The word temple also
 means body. The Revelator was familiar
 with Jesus' use of this word, as when Jesus spoke of his
 material body as the temple to be temporarily rebuilt
 (John ii. 21). What further indication need we of the
 real man's incorporeality than this, that John saw
 heaven and earth with "no temple [body] therein"?
 This kingdom of God "is within you,"--is within
 reach of man's consciousness here, and the spiritual
 idea reveals it. In divine Science, man possesses this
 recognition of harmony consciously in proportion to his
 understanding of God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine sense of Deity</font></p>
 The term Lord, as used in our version of the Old
 Testament, is often synonymous with Jehovah, and expresses the Jewish concept, not yet elevated
 to deific apprehension through spiritual transfiguration. Yet the word gradually approaches a higher
 meaning. This human sense of Deity yields to the divine
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_577"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 577</font></a></p><p></p><p>sense, even as the material sense of personality yields 
 to the incorporeal sense of God and man as the infinite
 Principle and infinite idea, - as one Father with His universal family, held in the gospel of Love. The Lamb's
 wife presents the unity of male and female as no longer
 two wedded individuals, but as two individual natures 
 in one; and this compounded spiritual individuality reflects God as Father-Mother, not as a corporeal being.
 In this divinely united spiritual consciousness, there is no 
 impediment to eternal bliss,--to the perfectibility of
 God's creation.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The city of our God</font></p>
 This spiritual, holy habitation has no boundary 
 nor limit, but its four cardinal points are: first, the
 Word of Life, Truth, and Love; second,
 the Christ, the spiritual idea of God; third,
 Christianity, which is the outcome of the divine Principle of the Christ-idea in Christian history; fourth,
 Christian Science, which to-day and forever interprets 
 this great example and the great Exemplar. This city
 of our God has no need of sun or satellite, for Love
 is the light of it, and divine Mind is its own interpreter.
 All who are saved must walk in this light. Mighty
 potentates and dynasties will lay down their honors
 within the heavenly city. Its gates open towards light 
 and glory both within and without, for all is good, and
 nothing can enter that city, which "defileth. . . . or
 maketh a lie."
    
 The writer's present feeble sense of Christian Science
 closes with St. John's Revelation as recorded by the
 great apostle, for his vision is the acme of this Science 
 as the Bible reveals it.
 <p></p><p>In the following Psalm one word shows, though faintly,
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_578"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 578</font></a></p><p></p><p>the light which Christian Science throws on the Scriptures
 by substituting for the corporeal sense, the incorporeal
 or spiritual sense of Deity: </p><p>         PSALM XXIII
 </p><p>[DIVINE LOVE] is my shepherd; I shall not want.
 </p><p>[LOVE] maketh me to lie down in green pastures:
 </p><p>[LOVE] leadeth me beside the still waters.
 </p><p>[LOVE] restoreth my soul [spiritual sense]: [Love] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake.
 </p><p>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
 death, I will fear no evil: for [LOVE] is with me; [LOVE's]
 rod and [LOVE'S] staff they comfort me.
 </p><p>[LOVE] prepareth a table before me in the presence of
 mine enemies: [LOVE] anointeth my head with oil; my cup
 runneth over.
 </p><p>Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of
 my life; and I will dwell in the house [the consciousness]
 of [LOVE] for ever.
