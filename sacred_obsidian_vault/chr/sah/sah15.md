 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual interpretation</font></p>
 SCIENTIFIC interpretation of the Scriptures properly starts with the beginning of the Old Testament, chiefly because the spiritual import of
 the Word, in its earliest articulations, often
 seems so smothered by the immediate context as to
 require explication; whereas the New Testament narratives are clearer and come nearer the heart. Jesus illumines them, showing the poverty of mortal existence,
 but richly recompensing human want and woe with
 spiritual gain. The incarnation of Truth, that amplification of wonder and glory which angels could only
 whisper and which God illustrated by light and harmony, is consonant with ever-present Love. So-called
 mystery and miracle, which subserve the end of natural
 good, are explained by that Love for whose rest the
 weary ones sigh when needing something more native
 to their immortal cravings than the history of perpetual
 evil.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_502"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 502</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual overture</font></p>
 A second necessity for beginning with Genesis is that
 the living and real prelude of the older Scriptures is so
 brief that it would almost seem, from the
 preponderance of unreality in the entire narrative, as if reality did not predominate over unreality,
 the light over the dark, the straight line of Spirit over
 the mortal deviations and inverted images of the creator
 and His creation.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Deflection of being</font></p>
 Spiritually followed, the book of Genesis is the history
 of the untrue image of God, named a sinful mortal. This
 deflection of being, rightly viewed, serves to
 suggest the proper reflection of God and the
 spiritual actuality of man, as given in the first chapter
 of Genesis. Even thus the crude forms of human thought
 take on higher symbols and significations, when scientifically Christian views of the universe appear, illuminating time with the glory of eternity.
 <p></p><p>In the following exegesis, each text is followed by its
 spiritual interpretation according to the teachings of Christian Science.
 </p><p></p><p></p><center>EXEGESIS</center>
 <p>Genesis i. 1. In the beginning God created the heaven
 and the earth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ideas and identities</font></p>
 The infinite has no beginning. This word beginning
 is employed to signify the only, - that is, the eternal verity and unity of God and man, including
 the universe. The creative Principle--Life,
 Truth, and Love--is God. The universe reflects God.
 There is but one creator and one creation. This crea<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_503"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 503</font></a></p><p></p><p>tion consists of the unfolding of spiritual ideas and their
 identities, which are embraced in the infinite Mind and
 forever reflected. These ideas range from the infinitesimal to infinity, and the highest ideas are the sons
 and daughters of God.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 2. And the earth was without form, and void;
 and darkness was upon the face of the deep.   And the
 spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual harmony</font></p>
 The divine Principle and idea constitute spiritual harmony,--heaven and eternity. In the universe of Truth,
 matter is unknown. No supposition of error
 enters there. Divine Science, the Word of
 God, saith to the darkness upon the face of error, "God
 is All-in-all," and the light of ever-present Love illumines
 the universe. Hence the eternal wonder,--that infinite
 space is peopled with God's ideas, reflecting Him in
 countless spiritual forms.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 3. And God said, Let there be light: and
 there was light.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind's idea faultless</font></p>
 Immortal and divine Mind presents the idea of God:
 first, in light; second, in reflection; third, in spiritual and
 immortal forms of beauty and goodness. But
 this Mind creates no element nor symbol of
 discord and decay. God creates neither erring thought,
 mortal life, mutable truth, nor variable love.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 4. And God saw the light, that it was good:
 and God divided the light from the darkness.
 </p><p></p><p>God, Spirit, dwelling in infinite light and harmony
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_504"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 504</font></a></p><p></p><p>from which emanates the true idea, is never reflected by
 aught but the good.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 5. And God called the light Day, and the
 darkness He called Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Light preceding the sun</font></p>
 All questions as to the divine creation being both
 spiritual and material are answered in this passage, for
 though solar beams are not yet included in
 the record of creation, still there is light. This
 light is not from the sun nor from volcanic flames, but it
 is the revelation of Truth and of spiritual ideas. This
 also shows that there is no place where God's light is not
 seen, since Truth, Life, and Love fill immensity and are
 ever-present. Was not this a revelation instead of a
 creation?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Evenings and mornings</font></p>
 The successive appearing of God's ideas is represented
 as taking place on so many evenings and mornings, words which indicate, in the absence of solar
 time, spiritually clearer views of Him, views
 which are not implied by material darkness and dawn.
 Here we have the explanation of another passage of
 Scripture, that "one day is with the Lord as a thousand
 years." The rays of infinite Truth, when gathered into
 the focus of ideas, bring light instantaneously, whereas
 a thousand years of human doctrines, hypotheses, and
 vague conjectures emit no such effulgence.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit versus darkness</font></p>
 Did infinite Mind create matter, and call it light?
 Spirit is light, and the contradiction of Spirit is matter,
 darkness, and darkness obscures light. Material sense is nothing but a supposition of the
 absence of Spirit. No solar rays nor planetary revolutions
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_505"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 505</font></a></p><p></p><p>form the day of Spirit. Immortal Mind makes its own
 record, but mortal mind, sleep, dreams, sin, disease, and
 death have no record in the first chapter of Genesis.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 6. And God said, Let there be a firmament in
 the midst of the waters, and let it divide the waters from
 the waters.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual firmament</font></p>
 Spiritual understanding, by which human conception,
 material sense, is separated from Truth, is the firmament.
 The divine Mind, not matter, creates all identities, and they are forms of Mind, the ideas of
 Spirit apparent only as Mind, never as mindless matter
 nor the so-called material senses.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 7. And God made the firmament, and divided
 the waters which were under the firmament from the waters
 which were above the firmament: and it was so.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Understanding imparted</font></p>
 Spirit imparts the understanding which uplifts consciousness and leads into all truth. The Psalmist saith:
 "The Lord on high is mightier than the noise 
 of many waters, yea, than the mighty waves of
 the sea." Spiritual sense is the discernment of spiritual
 good. Understanding is the line of demarcation between
 the real and unreal. Spiritual understanding unfolds
 Mind,--Life, Truth, and Love,--and demonstrates the
 divine sense, giving the spiritual proof of the universe in
 Christian Science.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Original reflected</font></p>
 This understanding is not intellectual, is not the result
 of scholarly attainments; it is the reality of all things
 brought to light. God's ideas reflect the immortal, unerring, and infinite. The mortal,
 erring, and finite are human beliefs, which apportion to
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_506"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 506</font></a></p><p></p><p>themselves a task impossible for them, that of distinguishing between the false and the true. Objects utterly unlike the original do not reflect that original. Therefore
 matter, not being the reflection of Spirit, has no real entity. Understanding is a quality of God, a quality which
 separates Christian Science from supposition and makes
 Truth final.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 8. And God called the firmament Heaven.
 And the evening and the morning were the second day.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Exalted thought</font></p>
 Through divine Science, Spirit, God, unites understanding to eternal harmony. The calm and exalted
 thought or spiritual apprehension is at peace.
 Thus the dawn of ideas goes on, forming each
 successive stage of progress.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 9. And God said, Let the waters under the
 heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry
 land appear: and it was so.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Unfolding of thoughts</font></p>
 Spirit, God, gathers unformed thoughts  into  their
 proper channels, and unfolds these thoughts,
 even as He opens the petals of a holy purpose
 in order that the purpose may appear.
 <p>Genesis i. 10. And God called the dry land Earth; and
 the gathering together of the waters called He Seas: and
 God saw that it was good.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit names and blesses</font></p>
 Here the human concept and divine idea seem confused by the translator, but they are not so in the scientifically Christian meaning of the text. Upon
 Adam devolved the pleasurable task of finding names for all material things, but Adam has not yet
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_507"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 507</font></a></p><p></p><p>appeared in the narrative. In metaphor, the dry land
 illustrates the absolute formations instituted by Mind,
 while water symbolizes the elements of Mind. Spirit duly
 feeds and clothes every object, as it appears in the line
 of spiritual creation, thus tenderly expressing the fatherhood and motherhood of God. Spirit names and blesses
 all. Without natures particularly defined, objects and
 subjects would be obscure, and creation would be full of
 nameless offspring,--wanderers from the parent Mind,
 strangers in a tangled wilderness.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 11. And God said, Let the earth bring forth
 grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding
 fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth:
 and it was so.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine propagation</font></p>
 The universe of Spirit reflects the creative power of
 the divine Principle, or Life, which reproduces the multitudinous forms of Mind and governs the multiplication of the compound idea man. The
 tree and herb do not yield fruit because of any propagating power of their own, but because they reflect the Mind
 which includes all. A material world implies a mortal
 mind and man a creator. The scientific divine creation
 declares immortal Mind and the universe created by God.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ever-appearing creation</font></p>
 Infinite Mind creates and governs all, from the mental molecule to infinity. This divine Principle of all
 expresses Science and art throughout His
 creation, and the immortality of man and the
 universe. Creation is ever appearing, and must ever continue to appear from the nature of its inexhaustible source.
 Mortal sense inverts this appearing and calls ideas material. Thus misinterpreted, the divine idea seems to fall
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_508"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 508</font></a></p><p></p><p>to the level of a human or material belief, called mortal
 man. But the seed is in itself, only as the divine Mind
 is All and reproduces all--as Mind is the multiplier,
 and Mind's infinite idea, man and the universe, is the
 product. The only intelligence or substance of a thought,
 a seed, or a flower is God, the creator of it. Mind is the
 Soul of all. Mind is Life, Truth, and Love which governs all.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 12. And the earth brought forth grass, and
 herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding
 fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw
 that it was good.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mind's pure thought</font></p>
 God determines the gender of His own ideas. Gender is mental, not material.  The seed within itself is
 the pure thought emanating from divine
 Mind. The feminine gender is not yet expressed in the text. Gender means simply kind or sort,
 and does not necessarily refer either to masculinity or
 femininity. The word is not confined to sexuality, and
 grammars always recognize a neuter gender, neither
 male nor female. The Mind or intelligence of production names the female gender last in the ascending order
 of creation. The intelligent individual idea, be it male
 or female, rising from the lesser to the greater, unfolds
 the infinitude of Love.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 13. And the evening and the morning were
 the third day.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Rising to the light</font></p>
 The third stage in the order of Christian Science is an
 important one to the human thought, letting in the light
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_509"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 509</font></a></p><p></p><p>of spiritual understanding. This period corresponds to
 the resurrection, when Spirit is discerned to be the Life of
 all, and the deathless Life, or Mind, dependent
 upon no material organization.  Our Master 
 reappeared to his students,--to their apprehension he
 rose from the grave,--on the third day of his ascending
 thought, and so presented to them the certain sense of
 eternal Life.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 14. And God said, Let there be lights in the
 firmament of the heaven, to divide the day from the night;
 and let them be for signs, and for seasons, and for days,
 and years.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Rarefaction of thought</font></p>
 Spirit creates no other than heavenly or celestial bodies,
 but the stellar universe is no more celestial than our earth.
 This text gives the idea of the rarefaction of 
 thought as it ascends higher.  God forms and
 peoples the universe. The light of spiritual understanding gives gleams of the infinite only, even as nebulae indicate the immensity of space.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine nature appearing</font></p>
 So-called mineral, vegetable, and animal substances
 are no more contingent now on time or material structure than they were when "the morning stars
 sang together." Mind made the "plant of
 the field before it was in the earth."  The periods of
 spiritual ascension are the days and seasons of Mind's
 creation, in which beauty, sublimity, purity, and holiness
 - yea, the divine nature - appear in man and the universe never to disappear.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual ideas apprehended</font></p>
 Knowing the Science of creation, in which all is Mind
 and its ideas, Jesus rebuked the material thought of his
 fellow-countrymen: "Ye can discern the face of the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_510"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 510</font></a></p><p></p><p>sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the times?"
 How much more should we seek to apprehend the spiritual ideas of God, than to dwell on the objects
 of sense! To discern the rhythm of Spirit
 and to be holy, thought must be purely spiritual.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 15. And let them be for lights in the  firmament of the heaven, to give light upon the earth:  and it
 was so.
 </p><p></p><p>Truth and Love enlighten the understanding, in whose
 "light shall we see light;" and this illumination is reflected spiritually by all who walk in the light and turn
 away from a false material sense.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 16.  And God made two great lights; the
 greater light to rule the day, and the lesser light to rule the
 night: He made the stars also.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Geology a failure</font></p>
 The sun is a metaphorical representation of Soul outside the body, giving existence and intelligence to the
 universe. Love alone can impart the limitless idea of infinite Mind. Geology has never
 explained the earth's formations; it cannot explain them.
 There is no Scriptural allusion to solar light until time has
 been already divided into evening and morning; and the
 allusion to fluids (Genesis i. 2) indicates a supposed formation of matter by the resolving of fluids into solids,
 analogous to the suppositional resolving of thoughts into
 material things.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual subdivision</font></p>
 Light is a symbol of Mind, of Life, Truth, and Love,
 and not a vitalizing property of matter. Science reveals only one Mind, and this one shining by its own light and governing the universe, including
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_511"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 511</font></a></p><p></p><p>man, in perfect harmony. This Mind forms ideas, its
 own images, subdivides and radiates their borrowed light,
 intelligence, and so explains the Scripture phrase, "whose
 seed is in itself." Thus God's ideas "multiply and replenish the earth." The divine Mind supports the sublimity, magnitude, and infinitude of spiritual creation.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 17, 18. And God set them in the firmament of
 the heaven, to give light upon the earth, and to rule over
 the day and over the night, and to divide the light from the
 darkness: and God saw that it was good.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Darkness scattered</font></p>
 In divine Science, which is the seal of Deity and has
 the impress of heaven, God is revealed as infinite light. In the eternal Mind, no night is
 there.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 19. And the evening and the morning were
 the fourth day.
 </p><p></p><p>The changing glow and full effulgence of God's infinite ideas, images, mark the periods of progress.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 20. And God said, Let the waters bring forth
 abundantly the moving creature that hath life, and fowl
 that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of
 heaven.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Soaring aspirations</font></p>
 To mortal mind, the universe is liquid, solid, and a‰riform. Spiritually interpreted, rocks and mountains stand
 for solid and grand ideas. Animals and mortals metaphorically present the gradation of
 mortal thought, rising in the scale of intelligence, taking
 form in masculine, feminine, or neuter gender. The
 fowls, which fly above the earth in the open firmament
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_512"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 512</font></a></p><p></p><p>of heaven, correspond to aspirations soaring beyond and
 above corporeality to the understanding of the incorporeal
 and divine Principle, Love.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 21. And God created great whales, and every
 living creature that moveth, which the waters brought forth
 abundantly, after their kind, and every winged fowl after
 his kind: and God saw that it was good.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Seraphic symbols</font></p>
 Spirit is symbolized by strength, presence, and power,
 and also by holy thoughts, winged with Love. These angels of His presence, which have the holiest
 charge, abound in the spiritual atmosphere of
 Mind, and consequently reproduce their own characteristics. Their individual forms we know not, but we do
 know that their natures are allied to God's nature; and
 spiritual blessings, thus typified, are the externalized, yet
 subjective, states of faith and spiritual understanding.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 22. And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and fill the waters in the seas; and let
 fowl multiply in the earth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Multiplication of pure ideas</font></p>
 Spirit blesses the multiplication of its own pure and
 perfect ideas. From the infinite elements of the one
 Mind emanate all form, color, quality, and
 quantity, and these are mental, both primarily
 and secondarily. Their spiritual nature is discerned only
 through the spiritual senses. Mortal mind inverts the true
 likeness, and confers animal names and natures upon its
 own misconceptions. Ignorant of the origin and operations of mortal mind,--that is, ignorant of itself,--this
 so-called mind puts forth its own qualities, and claims
 God as their author; albeit God is ignorant of the ex<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_513"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 513</font></a></p><p></p><p>istence of both this mortal mentality, so-called, and its
 claim, for the claim usurps the deific prerogatives and is
 an attempted infringement on infinity.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 23. And the evening and the morning were
 the fifth day.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual spheres</font></p>
 Advancing spiritual steps in the teeming universe of
 Mind lead on to spiritual spheres and exalted beings. To
 material sense, this divine universe is dim and
 distant, gray in the sombre hues of twilight;
 but anon the veil is lifted, and the scene shifts into light.
 In the record, time is not yet measured by solar revolutions,
 and the motions and reflections of deific power cannot be
 apprehended until divine Science becomes the interpreter.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 24. And God said, Let the earth bring forth
 the living creature after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing,
 and beast of the earth after his kind: and it was so.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Continuity of thoughts</font></p>
 Spirit diversifies, classifies, and individualizes all
 thoughts, which are as eternal as the Mind
 conceiving them; but the intelligence, existence, and continuity of all individuality remain in God,
 who is the divinely creative Principle thereof.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 25. And God made the beast of the earth after
 his kind, and cattle after their kind, and everything that
 creepeth upon the earth after his kind: and God saw that
 it was good.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">God's thoughts are spiritual realities</font></p>
 God creates all forms of reality. His thoughts are
 spiritual realities. So-called mortal mind - being nonexistent and consequently not within the range of im<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_514"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 514</font></a></p><p></p><p>mortal existence--could not by simulating deific power
 invert the divine creation, and afterwards recreate persons or things upon its own plane, since nothing exists beyond the range of all-inclusive
 infinity, in which and of which God is the
 sole creator. Mind, joyous in strength, dwells in the
 realm of Mind. Mind's infinite ideas run and disport themselves.  In humility they climb the heights of
 holiness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Qualities of thought</font></p>
 Moral courage is "the lion of the tribe of Juda," the
 king of the mental realm. Free and fearless it roams in
 the forest. Undisturbed it lies in the open
 field, or rests in "green pastures, . . . beside
 the still waters." In the figurative transmission from the
 divine thought to the human, diligence, promptness, and
 perseverance are likened to "the cattle upon a thousand
 hills." They carry the baggage of stern resolve, and
 keep pace with highest purpose.   Tenderness accompanies all the might imparted by Spirit. The individuality created by God is not carnivorous, as witness the
 millennial estate pictured by Isaiah: <p></p><p>   The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb,
    And the leopard shall lie down with the kid;
    And the calf and the young lion, and the fatling together;
    And a little child shall lead them.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Creatures of God useful</font></p>
 Understanding the control which Love held over all,
 Daniel felt safe in the lions' den, and Paul proved the
 viper to be harmless. All of God's creatures
 moving in the harmony of Science, are harmless, useful, indestructible. A realization of this grand
 verity was a source of strength to the ancient worthies.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_515"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 515</font></a></p><p></p><p>It supports Christian healing, and enables its possessor
 to emulate the example of Jesus.  "And God saw that
 it was good."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The serpent harmless</font></p>
 Patience is symbolized by the tireless worm, creeping
 over lofty summits, persevering in its intent. The serpent of God's creating is neither subtle nor
 poisonous, but is a wise idea, charming in  its
 adroitness, for Love's ideas are subject to the Mind which
 forms them,--the power which changeth the serpent
 into a staff.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 26. And God said, Let us make man in our
 image, after our likeness; and let them have dominion over
 the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over
 the cattle, and over all the earth, and over every creeping
 thing that creepeth upon the earth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Elohistic plurality</font></p>
 The eternal Elohim includes the forever universe.
 The name Elohim is in the plural, but this plurality of
 Spirit does not imply more than one God, nor
 does it imply three persons in one. It relates
 to the oneness, the triunity of Life, Truth, and Love.
 "Let them have dominion." Man is the family name
 for all ideas,--the sons and daughters of God. All that
 God imparts moves in accord with Him, reflecting goodness and power.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Reflected likeness</font></p>
 Your mirrored reflection is your own image or likeness. If you lift a weight, your reflection does this also.
 If you speak, the lips of this likeness move in
 accord with yours. Now compare man before
 the mirror to his divine Principle, God. Call the mirror
 divine Science, and call man the reflection. Then note
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_516"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 516</font></a></p><p></p><p>how true, according to Christian Science, is the reflection
 to its original. As the reflection of yourself appears in
 the mirror, so you, being spiritual, are the reflection of
 God. The substance, Life, intelligence, Truth, and Love,
 which constitute Deity, are reflected by His creation;
 and when we subordinate the false testimony of the
 corporeal senses to the facts of Science, we shall see
 this true likeness and reflection everywhere.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Love imparts beauty</font></p>
 God fashions all things, after His own likeness. Life
 is reflected in existence, Truth in truthfulness, God in
 goodness, which impart their own peace and 
 permanence.  Love, redolent with unselfishness, bathes all in beauty and light. The grass beneath
 our feet silently exclaims, "The meek shall inherit the
 earth." The modest arbutus sends her sweet breath to
 heaven. The great rock gives shadow and shelter. The
 sunlight glints from the church-dome, glances into the
 prison-cell, glides into the sick-chamber, brightens the
 flower, beautifies the landscape, blesses the earth. Man,
 made in His likeness, possesses and reflects God's dominion over all the earth. Man and woman as coexistent
 and eternal with God forever reflect, in glorified quality,
 the infinite Father-Mother God.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 27. So God created man in His own image,
 in the image of God created He him; male and female
 created He them.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ideal man and woman</font></p>
 To emphasize this momentous thought, it is repeated
 that God made man in His own image, to reflect the
 divine Spirit. It follows that man is a generic
 term. Masculine, feminine, and neuter genders are human concepts. In one of the ancient  lan<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_517"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 517</font></a></p><p></p><p>guages the word for man is used also as the synonym of
 mind. This definition has been weakened by anthropomorphism, or a humanization of Deity. The word anthropomorphic, in such a phrase as "an anthropomorphic
 God," is derived from two Greek words, signifying man
 and form, and may be defined as a mortally mental attempt to reduce Deity to corporeality. The life-giving
 quality of Mind is Spirit, not matter. The ideal man
 corresponds to creation, to intelligence, and to Truth.
 The ideal woman corresponds to Life and to Love. In
 divine Science, we have not as much authority for considering God masculine, as we have for considering
 Him feminine, for Love imparts the clearest idea of
 Deity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine personality</font></p>
 The world believes in many persons; but if God is personal, there is but one person, because there is but one
 God. His personality can only be reflected,
 not transmitted. God has countless ideas, and
 they all have one Principle and parentage. The only
 proper symbol of God as person is Mind's infinite ideal.
 What is this ideal? Who shall behold it? This ideal
 <p>is God's own image, spiritual and infinite. Even eternity
 can never reveal the whole of God, since there is no limit
 to infinitude or to its reflections.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 28. And God blessed them, and God said unto
 them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth,
 and subdue it; and have dominion over the fish of the sea,
 and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing
 that moveth upon the earth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Birthright of man</font></p>
 Divine Love blesses its own ideas, and causes them to
 multiply,--to manifest His power.  Man is not made
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_518"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 518</font></a></p><p>to till the soil.  His birthright is dominion, not subjection. He is lord of the belief in earth
 and heaven,--himself subordinate alone to
 his Maker. This is the Science of being.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis i. 29, 30. And God said, Behold, I have given
 you every herb bearing seed, which is upon the face of all
 the earth, and every tree, in the which is the fruit of a tree
 yielding seed; to you it shall be for meat. And to  every
 beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air, and to
 everything that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there is
 life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it
 was so.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Assistance in brotherhood</font></p>
 God gives the lesser idea of Himself for a link to the
 greater, and in return, the higher always protects the
 lower. The rich in spirit help the poor in
 one grand brotherhood, all leaving the same
 Principle, or Father; and blessed is that man who seeth
 his brother's need and supplieth it, seeking his own in
 another's good. Love giveth to the least spiritual idea
 might, immortality, and goodness, which shine through
 all as the blossom shines through the bud. All the varied
 expressions of God reflect health, holiness, immortality infinite Life, Truth, and Love.
 <p></p><p>Genesis i. 31.  And God saw everything that He had
 made, and, behold, it was very good. And the evening and
 the morning were the sixth day.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Perfection of creation</font></p>
 The divine Principle, or Spirit, comprehends and expresses all, and all must therefore be as perfect is the
 divine Principle is perfect. Nothing is new to Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_519"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 519</font></a></p><p></p><p>Nothing can be novel to eternal Mind, the author of all
 things, who from all eternity knoweth His own ideas.
 Deity was satisfied with His work. How could
 He be otherwise, since the spiritual creation
 was the outgrowth, the emanation, of His infinite selfcontainment and immortal wisdom?
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis ii. 1. Thus the heavens and the earth were
 finished, and all the host of them.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Infinity measureless</font></p>
 Thus the ideas of God in universal being are complete
 and forever expressed, for Science reveals infinity and
 the fatherhood and motherhood of Love. Human capacity is slow to discern and to grasp
 God's creation and the divine power and presence which
 go with it, demonstrating its spiritual origin. Mortals
 can never know the infinite, until they throw off the old
 man and reach the spiritual image and likeness. What
 can fathom infinity! How shall we declare Him, till,
 in the language of the apostle, "we all come in the unity
 of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto
 a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of Christ"?
 <p></p><p>Genesis ii. 2. And on the seventh day God ended His
 work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh
 day from all His work which He had made.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Resting in holy work</font></p>
 God rests in action. Imparting has not impoverished,
 can never impoverish, the divine Mind. No
 exhaustion follows the action of this Mind,
 according to the apprehension of divine Science. The
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_520"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 520</font></a></p><p></p><p>highest and sweetest rest, even from a human standpoint,
 is in holy work.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Love and man coexistent</font></p>
 Unfathomable Mind is expressed. The depth, breadth,
 height, might, majesty, and glory of infinite Love fill all
 space.  That is enough!  Human  language
 can repeat only an infinitesimal part of what
 exists. The absolute ideal, man, is no more seen nor
 comprehended by mortals, than is His infinite Principle,
 Love. Principle and its idea, man, are coexistent and
 eternal. The numerals of infinity, called seven days, can
 never be reckoned according to the calendar of time.
 These days will appear as  mortality disappears, and they
 will reveal eternity, newness of Life, in which all sense of
 error forever disappears and thought accepts the divine
 infinite calculus.
 <p></p><p>Genesis ii. 4, 5. These are the generations of the heavens
 and of the earth when they were created, in the day that the
 Lord God [Jehovah] made the earth and the heavens, and
 every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and every
 herb of the field before it grew: for the Lord God [Jehovah]
 had not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not
 a man to till the ground.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Growth is from Mind</font></p>
 Here is the emphatic declaration that God creates all
 through Mind, not through matter,--that the plant
 grows, not because of seed or soil, but because
 growth is the eternal mandate of Mind. Mortal thought drops into the ground, but the immortal creating thought is from above, not from beneath. Because
 Mind makes all, there is nothing left to be made by a
 lower power. Spirit acts through the Science of Mind,
 never causing man to till the ground, but making him
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_521"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 521</font></a></p><p></p><p>superior to the soil. Knowledge of this lifts man above
 the sod, above earth and its environments, to conscious
 spiritual harmony and eternal being.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual narrative</font></p>
 Here the inspired record closes its narrative of being
 that is without beginning or end. All that is made is
 the work of God, and all is good. We leave
 this brief, glorious history of spiritual creation
 (as stated in the first chapter of Genesis) in the hands of
 God, not of man, in the keeping of Spirit, not matter, joyfully acknowledging now and forever God's supremacy,
 omnipotence, and omnipresence.
 <p></p><p>The harmony and immortality of man are intact. We
 should look away from the opposite supposition that man
 is created materially, and turn our gaze to the spiritual
 record of creation, to that which should be engraved on
 the understanding and heart "with the point of a diamond"
 and the pen of an angel.
 </p><p></p><p>The reader will naturally ask if there is nothing more
 about creation in the book of Genesis. Indeed there is,
 but the continued account is mortal and material.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis ii. 6. But there went up a mist from the earth,
 and watered the whole face of the ground.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The story of error</font></p>
 The Science and truth of the divine creation have been
 presented in the verses already considered, and now the
 opposite error, a material view of creation, is
 to be set forth. The second chapter of Genesis contains a statement of this material view of God and
 the universe, a statement which is the exact opposite of
 scientific truth as before recorded. The history of error
 or matter, if veritable, would set aside the omnipotence
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_522"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 522</font></a></p><p></p><p>of Spirit; but it is the false history in contradistinction
 to the true.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The two records</font></p>
 The Science of the first record proves the falsity of
 the second. If one is true, the other is false, for they are
 antagonistic. The first record assigns all
 might and government to God, and endows
 man out of God's perfection and power. The second
 record chronicles man as mutable and mortal, - as having broken away from Deity and as revolving in an orbit
 of his own. Existence, separate from divinity, Science
 explains as impossible.
 <p></p><p>This second record unmistakably gives the history of
 error in its externalized forms, called life and intelligence in matter. It records pantheism, opposed to the
 supremacy of divine Spirit; but this state of things is
 declared to be temporary and this man to be mortal, dust returning to dust.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Erroneous representation</font></p>
 In this erroneous theory, matter takes the place of Spirit.
 Matter is represented as the life-giving principle of the
 earth. Spirit is represented as entering matter in order to create man. God's glowing
 denunciations of man when not found in His
 image, the likeness of Spirit, convince reason and coincide
 with revelation in declaring this material creation false.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Hypothetical reversal</font></p>
 This latter part of the second chapter of Genesis, which
 portrays Spirit as supposedly cooperating with matter in
 constructing the universe, is based on some
 hypothesis of error, for the Scripture just preceding declares God's work to be finished. Does Life,
 Truth, and Love produce death, error, and hatred? Does
 the creator condemn His own creation? Does the unerring Principle of divine law change or repent? It can<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_523"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 523</font></a></p><p></p><p>not be so. Yet one might so judge from an unintelligent
 perusal of the Scriptural account now under comment.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mist, or false claim</font></p>
 Because of its false basis, the mist of obscurity evolved
 by error deepens the false claim, and finally declares that
 God knows error and that error can improve
 His creation. Although presenting the exact
 opposite of Truth, the lie claims to be truth. The creations of matter arise from a mist or false claim, or from
 mystification, and not from the firmament, or understanding, which God erects between the true and false.
 In error everything comes from beneath, not from above.
 All is material myth, instead of the reflection of
 Spirit.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Distinct documents</font></p>
 It may be worth while here to remark that, according
 to the best scholars, there are clear evidences of two distinct documents in the early part of the book of
 Genesis. One is called the Elohistic, because
 the Supreme Being is therein called Elohim. The other
 document is called the Jehovistic, because Deity therein is
 always called Jehovah,--or Lord God, as our common
 version translates it.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jehovah or Elohim</font></p>
 Throughout the first chapter of Genesis and in three
 verses of the second,--in what we understand  to be the
 spiritually scientific account of creation,--it is
 Elohim (God) who creates. From the fourth
 verse of chapter two to chapter five, the creator is called
 Jehovah, or the Lord. The different accounts become
 more and more closely intertwined to the end of chapter
 twelve, after which the distinction is not definitely traceable. In the historic parts of the Old Testament, it is
 usually Jehovah, peculiarly the divine sovereign of the
 Hebrew people, who is referred to.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_524"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 524</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Gods of the heathen</font></p>
 The idolatry which followed this material mythology is
 seen in the Phoenician worship of Baal, in the Moabitish
 god Chemosh, in the Moloch of the Amorites,
 in the Hindoo Vishnu, in the Greek Aphrodite, and in a thousand other so-called deities.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Jehovah a tribal deity</font></p>
 It was also found among the Israelites, who constantly
 went after "strange gods."  They called the Supreme
 Being by the national name of Jehovah.   In
 that name of Jehovah, the true idea of God
 seems almost lost. God becomes "a man of war," a
 tribal god to be worshipped, rather than Love, the divine
 Principle to be lived and loved.
 <p></p><p>Genesis ii. 7. And the Lord God [Jehovah] formed man
 of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils
 the breath of life; and man became a living soul.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Creation reversed</font></p>
 Did the divine and infinite Principle become a finite
 deity, that he should now be called Jehovah? With
 a single command, Mind had made man,
 both male and female.  How then could a
 material organization become the basis of man? How
 could the non-intelligent become the medium of Mind,
 and error be the enunciator of Truth? Matter is not
 the reflection of Spirit, yet God is reflected in all His
 creation. Is this addition to His creation real or unreal? Is it the truth, or is it a lie concerning man and
 God?
 <p></p><p>It must be a lie, for God presently curses the ground.
 Could Spirit evolve its opposite, matter, and give matter
 ability to sin and suffer? Is Spirit, God, injected into
 dust, and eventually ejected at the demand of matter?
 Does Spirit enter dust, and lose therein the divine nature
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_525"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 525</font></a></p><p></p><p>and omnipotence? Does Mind, God, enter matter to become there a mortal sinner, animated by the breath of
 God? In this narrative, the validity of matter is opposed,
 not the validity of Spirit or Spirit's creations. Man reflects God; mankind represents the Adamic race, and is
 a human, not a divine, creation.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Definitions of man</font></p>
 The following are some of the equivalents of the term
 man in different languages. In  the Saxon, mankind, a
 woman, any one; in the Welsh, that which rises
 up,--the primary sense being image, form; in
 the Hebrew, image, similitude; in the Icelandic, mind.
 The following translation is from the Icelandic: <p></p><p>And God said, Let us make man after our mind and
 our likeness; and God shaped man after His mind; after
 God's mind shaped He Him; and He shaped them male and
 female.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No baneful creation</font></p>
 In the Gospel of John, it is declared that all things were
 made through the Word of God, "and without Him [the
 logos, or word] was not anything made that
 was made." Everything good or worthy, God
 made. Whatever is valueless or baneful, He did not
 make,--hence its unreality. In the Science of Genesis
 we read that He saw everything which He had made,
 "and, behold, it was very good." The corporeal senses
 declare otherwise; and if we give the same heed to the
 history of error as to the records of truth, the Scriptural
 record of sin and death favors the false conclusion of the
 material senses. Sin, sickness, and death must be deemed
 as devoid of reality as they are of good, God.
 <p></p><p>Genesis ii. 9. And out of the ground made the Lord God
 [Jehovah] to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight,
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_526"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 526</font></a></p><p></p><p>and good for food; the tree of life also, in the midst of the
 garden, and the tree of knowledge of good and evil.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Contradicting first creation</font></p>
 The previous and more scientific record of creation
 declares that God made "every plant of the field before it was in the earth." This opposite
 declaration, this statement that life issues
 from matter, contradicts the teaching of the first chapter,--namely, that all Life is God. Belief is less than
 understanding. Belief involves theories of material hearing, sight, touch, taste, and smell, termed the five senses.
 The appetites and passions, sin, sickness, and death,
 follow in the train of this error of a belief in intelligent
 matter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Record of error</font></p>
 The first mention of evil is in the legendary Scriptural
 text in the second chapter of Genesis.  God  pronounced
 good all that He created, and the Scriptures
 declare that He created all.  The "tree of
 life" stands for the idea of Truth, and the sword which
 guards it is the type of divine Science.  The "tree of
 knowledge" stands for the erroneous doctrine that the
 knowledge of evil is as real, hence as God-bestowed, as
 the knowledge of good. Was evil instituted through God,
 Love? Did He create this fruit-bearer of sin in contradiction of the first creation? This second biblical account
 is a picture of error throughout.
 <p></p><p>Genesis ii. 15. And the Lord God [Jehovah] took the
 man, and put him into the garden of Eden, to dress it and
 to keep it.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Garden of Eden</font></p>
 The name Eden, according to Cruden, means pleasure,
 delight. In this text Eden stands for the mortal, mate<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_527"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 527</font></a></p><p></p><p>rial body. God could not put Mind into matter nor infinite Spirit into finite form to dress it and
 keep it,--to make it beautiful or to cause it
 to live and grow. Man is God's reflection, needing no
 cultivation, but ever beautiful and complete.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis ii. 16, 17. And the Lord God [Jehovah] commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of the garden thou
 mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good
 and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou
 eatest thereof thou shalt surely die.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No temptation from God</font></p>
 Here the metaphor represents God, Love, as tempting
 man, but the Apostle James says: "God cannot be
 tempted with evil, neither tempteth He any
 man." It is true that a knowledge of evil would
 make man mortal. It is plain also that material perception, gathered from the corporeal senses, constitutes evil and mortal knowledge. But is it true that God,
 good, made "the tree of life" to be the tree of death to His
 own creation? Has evil the reality of good? Evil is unreal because it is a lie,--false in every statement.
 <p></p><p>Genesis ii. 19. And out of the ground the Lord God
 [Jehovah] formed every beast of the field, and every fowl
 of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he
 would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living
 creature, that was the name thereof.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Creation's counterfeit</font></p>
 Here the lie represents God as repeating creation, but
 doing so materially, not spiritually, and asking a prospective sinner to help Him.  Is the
 Supreme Being retrograding, and is man giving up his
 dignity? Was it requisite for the formation of man
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_528"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 528</font></a></p><p></p><p>that dust should become sentient, when all being is the
 reflection of the eternal Mind, and the record declares
 that God has already created man, both male and
 female? That Adam gave the name and nature of
 animals, is solely mythological and material.   It cannot be true that man was ordered to create man anew
 in partnership with God; this supposition was a dream,
 a myth.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis ii. 21, 22. And the Lord God [Jehovah, Yawah]
 caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept: and
 He took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead
 thereof; and the rib, which the Lord God [Jehovah] had
 taken from man, made He a woman, and brought her unto
 the man.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Hypnotic surgery</font></p>
 Here falsity, error, credits Truth, God, with inducing
 a sleep or hypnotic state in Adam in order to perform a
 surgical operation on him and thereby create
 woman. This is the first record of magnetism. Beginning creation with darkness instead of light,
 - materially rather than spiritually, - error now simulates the work of Truth, mocking Love and declaring what great things error has done. Beholding the
 creations of his own dream and calling them real and
 God-given, Adam--alias error--gives them names.
 Afterwards he is supposed to become the basis of the
 creation of woman and of his own kind, calling them
 mankind,--that is, a kind of man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental midwifery</font></p>
 But according to this narrative, surgery was first performed mentally and without instruments;
 and this may be a useful hint to the medical
 faculty. Later in human history, when the forbidden
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_529"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 529</font></a></p><p></p><p>fruit was bringing forth fruit of its own kind, there
 came a suggestion of change in the modus operandi, that man should be born of woman, not woman again
 taken from man. It came about, also, that instruments
 were needed to assist the birth of mortals.   The first
 system of suggestive obstetrics has changed. Another
 change will come as to the nature and origin of man,
 and this revelation will destroy the dream of existence,
 reinstate reality, usher in Science and the glorious fact
 of creation, that both man and woman proceed from
 God and are His eternal children, belonging to no lesser
 parent.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis iii. 1-3. Now the serpent was more subtle than
 any beast of the field which the Lord God [Jehovah] had
 made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said,
 Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?  And the
 woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of
 the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is
 in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat
 of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mythical serpent</font></p>
 Whence comes a talking, lying serpent to tempt the
 children of divine Love? The serpent enters into the
 metaphor only as evil. We have nothing in the
 animal kingdom which represents the species
 described,--a talking serpent,--and should rejoice  that
 evil, by whatever figure presented, contradicts itself  and
 has neither origin nor support in Truth and good. Seeing
 this, we should have faith to fight all claims of evil, because we know that they are worthless and unreal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error or Adam</font></p>
 Adam, the synonym for error, stands for a belief of
 material mind. He begins his reign over man some<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_530"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 530</font></a></p><p></p><p>what mildly, but he increases in falsehood and his days
 become shorter. In this development, the immortal, spiritual law of Truth is made manifest
 as forever opposed to mortal, material sense.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Divine providence</font></p>
 In divine Science, man is sustained by God, the divine
 Principle of being. The earth, at God's command, brings
 forth food for man's use. Knowing this, Jesus
 once said, "Take no thought for your life,
 what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink,"--presuming
 not on the prerogative of his creator, but recognizing God,
 the Father and Mother of all, as able to feed and clothe
 man as He doth the lilies.
 <p></p><p>Genesis iii. 4, 5. And the serpent said unto the woman,
 Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day
 ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened; and ye shall
 be as gods, knowing good and evil.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Error's assumption</font></p>
 This myth represents error as always asserting its superiority over truth, giving the lie to divine Science and
 saying, through the material senses: "I can
 open your eyes. I can do what God has not
 done for you. Bow down to me and have another god.
 Only admit that I am real, that sin and sense are more
 pleasant to the eyes than spiritual Life, more to be desired than Truth, and I shall know you, and you will be
 mine." Thus Spirit and flesh war.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scriptural allegory</font></p>
 The history of error is a dream-narrative. The dream
 has no reality, no intelligence, no mind; therefore the
 dreamer and dream are one, for neither is
 true nor real. First, this narrative supposes
 that something springs from nothing, that matter precedes mind. Second, it supposes that mind enters matter,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_531"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 531</font></a></p><p></p><p>and matter becomes living, substantial, and intelligent.
 The order of this allegory--the belief that everything
 springs from dust instead of from Deity - has been maintained in all the subsequent forms of belief. This is the
 error, - that mortal man starts materially, that nonintelligence becomes intelligence, that mind and soul are
 both right and wrong.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Higher hope</font></p>
 It is well that the upper portions of the brain represent
 the higher moral sentiments, as if hope were ever prophesying thus: The human mind will sometime
 rise above all material and physical sense, exchanging it for spiritual perception, and exchanging human concepts for the divine consciousness. Then man
 will recognize his God-given dominion and being.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Biological inventions</font></p>
 If, in the beginning, man's body originated in nonintelligent dust, and mind was afterwards put into body
 by the creator, why is not this divine order 
 still maintained by God in perpetuating the
 species? Who will say that minerals, vegetables, and
 animals have a propagating property of their own?
 Who dares to say either that God is in matter or that
 matter exists without God? Has man sought out other
 creative inventions, and so changed the method of his
 Maker?
 <p></p><p>Which institutes Life,--matter or Mind? Does Life
 begin with Mind or with matter? Is Life sustained by
 matter or by Spirit? Certainly not by both, since flesh
 wars against Spirit and the corporeal senses can take no
 cognizance of Spirit. The mythologic theory of material life at no point resembles the scientifically Christian
 record of man as created by Mind in the image and likeness of God and having dominion over all the earth. Did
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_532"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 532</font></a></p><p></p><p>God at first create one man unaided, - that is, Adam, but afterwards require the union of the two sexes in order
 to create the rest of the human family? No! God makes
 and governs all.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Progeny cursed</font></p>
 All human knowledge and material sense must be
 gained from the five corporeal senses. Is this knowledge
 safe, when eating its first fruits brought death?
 "In the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt
 surely die," was the prediction in the story under consideration. Adam and his progeny were cursed, not blessed;
 and this indicates that the divine Spirit, or Father, condemns material man and remands him to dust.
 <p></p><p>Genesis iii. 9, 10. And the Lord God [Jehovah] called
 unto Adam, and said unto him, Where art thou? And he
 said, I heard Thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid,
 because I was naked; and I hid myself.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Shame the effect of sin</font></p>
 Knowledge and pleasure, evolved through material
 sense, produced the immediate fruits of fear and shame.
 Ashamed before Truth, error shrank abashed
 from the divine voice calling out to the corporeal senses. Its summons may be thus paraphrased:
 "Where art thou, man? Is Mind in matter? Is Mind
 capable of error as well as of truth, of evil as well as of
 good, when God is All and He is Mind and there is but
 one God, hence one Mind?"
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Fear comes of error</font></p>
 Fear was the first manifestation of the error of material sense. Thus error began and will end the dream of
 matter, In the allegory the body had been
 naked, and Adam knew it not; but now error
 demands that mind shall see and feel through matter, the
 five senses. The first impression material man had of
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_533"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 533</font></a></p><p></p><p>himself was one of nakedness and shame. Had he   lost
 man's rich inheritance and God's behest, dominion over
 all the earth? No! This had never been bestowed on
 Adam.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis iii. 11, 12. And He said, Who told thee that
 thou wast naked? Hast thou eaten of the tree, whereof I
 commanded thee that thou shouldst not eat? And the man
 said, The woman whom Thou gavest to be with me, she gave
 me of the tree, and I did eat.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The beguiling first lie</font></p>
 Here there is an attempt to trace all human errors
 directly or indirectly to God, or good, as if He were the
 creator of evil. The allegory shows that the
 snake-talker utters the first voluble lie, which
 beguiles the woman and demoralizes the man. Adam,
 alias mortal error, charges God and woman with his own
 dereliction, saying, "The woman, whom Thou gavest
 me, is responsible." According to this belief, the rib taken
 from Adam's side has grown into an evil mind, named
 woman, who aids man to make sinners more rapidly than
 he can alone. Is this an help meet for man?
 <p></p><p>Materiality, so obnoxious to God, is already found in the
 rapid deterioration of the bone and flesh which came from
 Adam to form Eve. The belief in material life and intelligence is growing worse at every step, but error has its
 suppositional day and multiplies until the end thereof.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">False womanhood</font></p>
 Truth, cross-questioning man as to His knowledge of
 error, finds woman the first to confess her fault. She
 says, "The serpent beguiled me, and I did 
 eat;" as much as to say in meek penitence,
 "Neither man nor God shall father my fault." She has
 already learned that corporeal sense is the serpent. Hence
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_534"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 534</font></a></p><p></p><p>she is first to abandon the belief in the material origin of
 man and to discern spiritual creation. This hereafter
 enabled woman to be the mother of Jesus and to behold
 at the sepulchre the risen Saviour, who was soon to manifest the deathless man of God's creating. This enabled
 woman to be first to interpret the Scriptures in their true
 sense, which reveals the spiritual origin of man.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis iii. 14, 15. And the Lord God [Jehovah] said
 unto the serpent, . . . I will put enmity between thee and
 the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall
 bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spirit and flesh</font></p>
 This prophecy has been fulfilled. The Son of the Virginmother unfolded the remedy for Adam, or error; and the
 Apostle Paul explains this warfare between the
 idea of divine power, which Jesus presented,
 and mythological material intelligence called energy and
 opposed to Spirit.
 <p></p><p>Paul says in his epistle to the Romans: "The carnal
 mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the
 law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they that
 are in the flesh cannot please God. But ye are not in the
 flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the spirit of God dwell
 in you."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Bruising sin's head</font></p>
 There will be greater mental opposition to the spiritual, scientific meaning of the Scriptures than there has
 ever been since the Christian era began. The
 serpent, material sense, will bite the heel of
 the woman,--will struggle to destroy the spiritual idea
 of Love; and the woman, this idea, will bruise the head
 of lust. The spiritual idea has given the understanding
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_535"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 535</font></a></p><p></p><p>a foothold in Christian Science. The seed of Truth and
 the seed of error, of belief and of understanding,--yea,
 the seed of Spirit and the seed of matter,--are the wheat
 and tares which time will separate, the one to be burned,
 the other to be garnered into heavenly places.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis iii. 16. Unto the woman He said, I will greatly
 multiply thy sorrow and thy conception: in sorrow thou
 shalt bring forth children; and thy desire shall be to thy
 husband, and he shall rule over thee.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Judgment on error</font></p>
 Divine Science deals its chief blow at the supposed material foundations of life and intelligence. It dooms idolatry. A belief in other gods, other creators,
 and other creations must go down before Christian Science. It unveils the results of sin as shown in
 sickness and death. When will man pass through the
 open gate of Christian Science into the heaven of Soul,
 into the heritage of the first born among men? Truth is
 indeed " the way."
 <p></p><p>Genesis iii. 17-19. And unto Adam He said, Because
 thou hast hearkened unto the voice of thy wife, and hast
 eaten of the tree of which I commanded thee, saying, Thou
 shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in
 sorrow shalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life: thorns
 also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and thou shalt
 eat the herb of the field: in the sweat of thy face shalt thou
 eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it
 wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt
 thou return.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">New earth and no more sea</font></p>
 In the first chapter of Genesis we read: "And God
 called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_536"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 536</font></a></p><p></p><p>of the waters called He Seas." In the Apocalypse it is
 written: "And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for
 the first heaven and the first earth were passed
 away; and there was no more sea." In St.
 John's vision, heaven and earth stand for spiritual ideas, and the sea, as a symbol of tempest-tossed
 human concepts advancing and receding, is represented
 as having passed away. The divine understanding reigns,
 is all and there is no other consciousness.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The fall of error</font></p>
 The way of error is awful to contemplate. The illusion of sin is without hope or God. If man's spiritual
 gravitation and attraction to one Father, in
 whom we "live, and move, and have our being," should be lost, and if man should be governed by
 corporeality instead of divine Principle, by body instead
 of by Soul, man would be annihilated. Created by flesh
 instead of by Spirit, starting from matter instead of from
 God, mortal man would be governed by himself. The
 blind leading the blind, both would fall.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True attainment</font></p>
 Passions and appetites must end in pain. They are
 "of few days, and full of trouble." Their supposed joys
 are cheats. Their narrow limits belittle their gratifications, and hedge about their achievements with thorns.
 <p>Mortal mind accepts the erroneous, material conception of life and joy, but the true idea is gained from the
 immortal side. Through toil, struggle, and sorrow, what do mortals attain? They give up
 their belief in perishable life and happiness; the mortal
 and material return to dust, and the immortal is reached.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis iii. 22-24. And the Lord God [Jehovah] said,
 Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_537"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 537</font></a></p><p></p><p>and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take
 also of the tree of life, and eat, and live forever; therefore
 the Lord God [Jehovah] sent him forth from the garden
 of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.
 So He drove out the man: and He placed at the east
 of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword
 which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of
 life.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Justice and recompense</font></p>
 A knowledge of evil was never the essence of divinity or manhood. In the first chapter of Genesis, evil
 has no local habitation nor name. Creation is there represented as spiritual, entire,
 and good. "Whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he
 also reap." Error excludes itself from harmony. Sin
 is its own punishment.  Truth guards the gateway
 to harmony. Error tills its own barren soil and buries
 itself in the ground, since ground and dust stand for
 nothingness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Inspired interpretation</font></p>
 No one can reasonably doubt that the purpose of this
 allegory--this second account in Genesis--is to depict
 the falsity of error and the effects of error.
 Subsequent Bible revelation is coordinate
 with the Science of creation recorded in the
 first chapter of Genesis. Inspired writers interpret the
 Word spiritually, while the ordinary historian interprets
 it literally. Literally taken, the text is made to appear
 contradictory in some places, and divine Love, which
 blessed the earth and gave it to man for a possession, is
 represented as changeable. The literal meaning would
 imply that God withheld from man the opportunity to
 reform, lest man should improve it and become better;
 but this is not the nature of God, who is Love always, <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_538"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 538</font></a></p><p></p><p>Love infinitely wise and altogether lovely, who "seeketh
 not her own."
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual gateway</font></p>
 Truth should, and does, drive error out of all selfhood.
 Truth is a two-edged sword, guarding and guiding.
 Truth places the cherub wisdom at the gate
 of understanding to note the proper guests.
 Radiant with mercy and justice, the sword of Truth
 gleams afar and indicates the infinite distance between
 Truth and error, between the material and spiritual, the unreal and the real.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Contrasted testimony</font></p>
 The sun, giving light and heat to the earth, is a figure
 of divine Life and Love, enlightening and sustaining the
 universe. The "tree of life" is significant of
 eternal reality or being. The "tree of knowledge" typifies unreality. The testimony of the serpent is
 significant of the illusion of error, of the false claims that
 misrepresent God, good. Sin, sickness, and death have
 no record in the Elohistic introduction of Genesis, in which
 God creates the heavens, earth, and man. Until that
 which contradicts the truth of being enters into the arena,
 evil has no history, and evil is brought into view only as
 the unreal in contradistinction to the real and eternal.
 <p></p><p>Genesis iv. 1. And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she
 conceived, and bare Cain, and said, I have gotten a man
 from the Lord [Jehovah].
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Erroneous conception</font></p>
 This account is given, not of immortal man, but of mortal man, and of sin which is temporal. As both mortal
 man and sin have a beginning, they must
 consequently have an end, while the sinless,
 real man is eternal. Eve's declaration, "I have gotten
 a man from the Lord," supposes God to be the author
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_539"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 539</font></a></p><p></p><p>of sin and sin's progeny. This false sense of existence
 is fratricidal. In the words of Jesus, it (evil, devil) is
 "a murderer from the beginning."   Error begins by
 reckoning life as separate from Spirit, thus sapping the
 foundations of immortality, as if life and immortality
 were something which matter can both give and take
 away.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Only one standard</font></p>
 What can be the standard of good, of Spirit, of Life,
 or of Truth, if they produce their opposites, such as evil,
 matter, error, and death? God could never
 impart an element of evil, and man possesses
 nothing which he has not derived from God. How then
 has man a basis for wrong-doing? Whence does he
 obtain the propensity or power to do evil? Has Spirit
 resigned to matter the government of the universe?
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">A type of falsehood</font></p>
 The Scriptures declare that God condemned this lie as
 to man's origin and character by condemning its symbol,
 the serpent, to grovel beneath all the beasts
 of the field. It is false to say that Truth and
 error commingle in creation. In parable and argument,
 this falsity is exposed by our Master as self-evidently
 wrong. Disputing these points with the Pharisees and
 arguing for the Science of creation, Jesus said: "Do men
 gather grapes of thorns?" Paul asked: "What communion hath light with darkness? And what concord
 hath Christ with Belial?"
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scientific offspring</font></p>
 The divine origin of Jesus gave him more than human
 power to expound the facts of creation, and demonstrate
 the one Mind which makes and governs man
 and the universe. The Science of creation,
 so conspicuous in the birth of Jesus inspired his wisest
 and least-understood sayings, and was the basis of his
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_540"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 540</font></a></p><p></p><p>marvellous demonstrations. Christ is the offspring of
 Spirit, and spiritual existence shows that Spirit creates
 neither a wicked nor a mortal man, lapsing into sin, sickness, and death.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Cleansing upheaval</font></p>
 In Isaiah we read: "I make peace, and create evil. I
 the Lord do all these things;" but the prophet referred to
 divine law as stirring up the belief in evil to its
 utmost, when bringing it to the surface and reducing it to its common denominator, nothingness. The
 muddy river-bed must be stirred in order to purify the
 stream. In moral chemicalization, when the symptoms
 of evil, illusion, are aggravated, we may think in our ignorance that the Lord hath wrought an evil; but we ought
 to know that God's law uncovers so-called sin and its
 effects, only that Truth may annihilate all sense of evil
 and all power to sin.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Allegiance to Spirit</font></p>
 Science renders "unto Caesar the things which are
 Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." It
 saith to the human sense of sin, sickness, and
 death, "God never made you, and you are a
 false sense which hath no knowledge of God." The purpose of the Hebrew allegory, representing error as assuming a divine character, is to teach mortals never to believe
 a lie.
 <p></p><p>Genesis iv. 3, 4. Cain brought of the fruit of the ground
 an offering unto the Lord [Jehovah]. And Abel, he also
 brought of the firstlings of his flock, and of the fat thereof.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Spiritual and material</font></p>
 Cain is the type of mortal and material man, conceived
 in sin and "shapen in iniquity;" he is not the
 type of Truth and Love. Material in origin
 and sense, he brings a material offering to God. Abel
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_541"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 541</font></a></p><p></p><p>takes his offering from the firstlings of the flock. A lamb
 is a more animate form of existence, and more nearly resembles a mind-offering than does Cain's fruit. Jealous
 of his brother's gift, Cain seeks Abel's life, instead of making his own gift a higher tribute to the Most High.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis iv. 4, 5. And the Lord [Jehovah] had respect
 unto Abel, and to his offering: but unto Cain, and to his
 offering, He had not respect.
 </p><p></p><p>Had God more respect for the homage bestowed through
 a gentle animal than for the worship expressed by Cain's
 fruit? No; but the lamb was a more spiritual type of
 even the human concept of Love than the herbs of the
 ground could be.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis iv. 8. Cain rose up against Abel his brother, and
 slew him.
 </p><p></p><p>The erroneous belief that life, substance, and intelligence can be material ruptures the life and brotherhood
 of man at the very outset.
 </p><p></p><p>Genesis iv. 9. And the Lord [Jehovah] said unto Cain,
 Where is Abel thy brother? And he said, I know not: Am
 I my brother's keeper?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Brotherhood repudiated</font></p>
 Here the serpentine lie invents new forms. At first it
 usurps divine power. It is supposed to say
 in the first instance, "Ye shall be as gods."
 Now it repudiates even the human duty of man towards
 his brother.
 <p></p><p>Genesis iv. 10, 11. And He [Jehovah] said, . . . The
 voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto Me from the ground.
 And now art thou cursed from the earth.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_542"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 542</font></a></p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Murder brings its curse</font></p>
 The belief of life in matter sins at every step. It incurs divine displeasure, and it would kill Jesus that it
 might be rid of troublesome Truth. Material
 beliefs would slay the spiritual idea whenever and wherever it appears.  Though error hides
 behind a lie and excuses guilt, error cannot forever be
 concealed. Truth, through her eternal laws, unveils
 error. Truth causes sin to betray itself, and sets upon
 error the mark of the beast. Even the disposition to
 excuse guilt or to conceal it is punished. The avoidance
 of justice and the denial of truth tend to perpetuate sin,
 invoke crime, jeopardize self-control, and mock divine
 mercy.
 <p></p><p>Genesis iv. 15. And the Lord [Jehovah] said unto him
 Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain, vengeance shall be taken
 on him sevenfold. And the Lord [Jehovah] set a mark
 upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Retribution and remorse</font></p>
 "They that take the sword shall perish with the
 sword." Let Truth uncover and destroy error in God's
 own way, and let human justice pattern the
 divine. Sin will receive its full penalty, both
 for what it is and for what it does. Justice marks
 the sinner, and teaches mortals not to remove the
 waymarks of God. To envy's own hell, justice consigns the lie which, to advance itself, breaks God's
 commandments.
 <p></p><p>Genesis iv. 16. And Cain went out from the presence of
 the Lord [Jehovah], and dwelt in the land of Nod.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Climax of suffering</font></p>
 The sinful misconception of Life as something less
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_543"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 543</font></a></p><p></p><p>than God, having no truth to support it, falls back upon
 itself. This error, after reaching the climax of suffering,
 yields to Truth and returns to dust; but it
 is only mortal man and not the real man,
 who dies. The image of Spirit cannot be effaced, since it
 is the idea of Truth and changes not, but becomes more
 beautifully apparent at error's demise.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Dwelling in dreamland</font></p>
 In divine Science, the material man is shut out from
 the presence of God. The five corporeal senses cannot
 take cognizance of Spirit. They cannot come
 into His presence, and must dwell in dreamland, until mortals arrive at the understanding that material life, with all its sin, sickness, and death, is an illusion, against which divine Science is engaged in a warfare
 of extermination. The great verities of existence are
 never excluded by falsity.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Man springs from Mind</font></p>
 All error proceeds from the evidence before the material senses. If man is material and originates in an
 egg, who shall say that he is not primarily
 dust? May not Darwin be right in thinking that apehood preceded mortal manhood? Minerals
 and vegetables are found, according to divine Science,
 to be the creations of erroneous thought, not of matter.
 Did man, whom God created with a word, originate
 in an egg? When Spirit made all, did it leave aught
 for matter to create? Ideas of Truth alone are reflected
 in the myriad manifestations of Life, and thus it is
 seen that man springs solely from Mind. The belief
 that matter supports life would make Life, or God,
 mortal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material inception</font></p>
 The text, "In the day that the Lord God [Jehovah
 God] made the earth and the heavens," introduces the
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_544"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 544</font></a></p><p></p><p>record of a material creation which followed the spiritual,
 - a creation so wholly apart from God's, that Spirit
 had no participation in it. In God's creation
 ideas became productive, obedient to Mind.
 There was no rain and "not a man  to till the ground."
 Mind, instead of matter, being the producer, Life was
 self-sustained. Birth, decay, and death arise from the
 material sense of things, not from the spiritual, for in
 the latter Life consisteth not of the things which a man
 eateth. Matter cannot change the eternal fact that
 man exists because God exists. Nothing is new to the
 infinite Mind.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">First evil suggestion</font></p>
 In Science, Mind neither produces matter nor does
 matter produce mind. No mortal mind has the might
 or right or wisdom to create or to destroy.
 All is under the control of the one Mind,
 even God. The first statement about evil,--the first
 suggestion of more than the one Mind,--is in the fable
 of the serpent. The facts of creation, as previously recorded, include nothing of the kind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Material personality</font></p>
 The serpent is supposed to say, "Ye shall be as gods,"
 but these gods must be evolved from materiality and be
 the very antipodes of immortal and spiritual
 being. Man is the likeness of Spirit, but a
 material personality is not this likeness. Therefore man,
 in this allegory, is neither a lesser god nor the image and
 likeness of the one God.
 <p></p><p>Material, erroneous belief reverses understanding and
 truth. It declares mind to be in and of matter, so-called
 mortal life to be Life, infinity to enter man's nostrils
 so that matter becomes spiritual.  Error begins with
 corporeality as the producer instead of divine Prin</p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_545"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 545</font></a></p><p></p><p>ciple, and explains Deity through mortal and finite conceptions.
 </p><p></p><p>"Behold, the man is become as one of us." This could
 not be the utterance of Truth or Science, for according
 to the record, material man was fast degenerating and
 never had been divinely conceived.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mental tillage</font></p>
 The condemnation of mortals to till the ground means
 this,--that mortals should so improve material belief
 by thought tending spiritually upward as to
 destroy materiality. Man, created by God,
 was given dominion over the whole earth. The notion
 of a material universe is utterly opposed to the theory
 of man as evolved from Mind. Such fundamental errors
 send falsity into all human doctrines and conclusions,
 and do not accord infinity to Deity.  Error tills the
 whole ground in this material theory, which is entirely a
 false view, destructive to existence and happiness. Outside of Christian Science all is vague and hypothetical, the
 opposite of Truth; yet this opposite, in its false view of
 God and man, impudently demands a blessing.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Erroneous standpoint</font></p>
 The translators of this record of scientific creation
 entertained a false sense of being.  They believed in
 the existence of matter, its propagation and
 power. From that standpoint of error, they
 could not apprehend the nature and operation of Spirit.
 Hence the seeming contradiction in that Scripture, which
 is so glorious in its spiritual signification. Truth has
 but one reply to all error,--to sin, sickness, and death:
 "Dust [nothingness] thou art, and unto dust [nothingness]
 shalt thou return."
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mortality mythical</font></p>
 "As in Adam [error] all die, even so in Christ [Truth]
 shall all be made alive." The mortality of man is a
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_546"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 546</font></a></p><p></p><p>myth, for man is immortal. The false belief that spirit is
 now submerged in matter, at some future time to be emancipated from it,--this belief alone is mortal.
 Spirit, God, never germinates, but is "the same
 yesterday, and to-day, and forever." If Mind, God, creates error, that error must exist in the divine Mind, and
 this assumption of error would dethrone the perfection
 of Deity.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">No truth from a material basis</font></p>
 Is Christian Science contradictory? Is the divine
 Principle of creation misstated? Has God no Science to
 declare Mind, while matter is governed by unerring intelligence? "There went up a mist
 from the earth." This represents error as
 starting from an idea of good on a material basis. It
 supposes God and man to be manifested only through
 the corporeal senses, although the material senses can
 take no cognizance of Spirit or the spiritual idea.
 <p></p><p>Genesis and the Apocalypse seem more obscure than
 other portions of the Scripture, because they cannot
 possibly be interpreted from a material standpoint. To
 the author, they are transparent, for they contain the deep
 divinity of the Bible.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Dawning of spiritual facts</font></p>
 Christian Science is dawning upon a material age.
 The great spiritual facts of being, like rays of light, shine
 in the darkness, though the darkness, comprehending them not, may deny their reality.
 The proof that the system stated in this book is Christianly scientific resides in the good this system accomplishes, for it cures on a divine demonstrable Principle
 which all may understand.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Proof given in healing</font></p>
 If mathematics should present a thousand different
 examples of one rule, the proving of one example would
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_547"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 547</font></a></p><p></p><p>authenticate all the others. A simple statement of Christian Science, if demonstrated by healing, contains the
 proof of all here said of Christian Science. If
 one of the statements in this book is true, every
 one must be true, for not one departs from the stated system and rule. You can prove for yourself, dear reader,
 the Science of healing, and so ascertain if the author has
 given you the correct interpretation of Scripture.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Embryonic evolution</font></p>
 The late Louis Agassiz, by his microscopic examination
 of a vulture's ovum, strengthens the thinker's conclusions
 as to the scientific theory of creation. Agassiz
 was able to see in the egg the earth's atmosphere, the gathering clouds, the moon and stars, while the
 germinating speck of so-called embryonic life seemed a
 small sun. In its history of mortality, Darwin's theory
 of evolution from a material basis is more consistent than
 most theories. Briefly, this is Darwin's theory,--that
 Mind produces its opposite, matter, and endues matter
 with power to recreate the universe, including man. Material evolution implies that the great First Cause must
 become material, and afterwards must either return to
 Mind or go down into dust and nothingness.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">True theory of the universe</font></p>
 The Scriptures are very sacred. Our aim must be to
 have them understood spiritually, for only by this understanding can truth be gained.  The true theory of the universe, including man, is not in
 material history but in spiritual development.
 Inspired thought relinquishes a material, sensual, and
 mortal theory of the universe, and adopts the spiritual and
 immortal.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Scriptural perception</font></p>
 It is this spiritual perception of Scripture, which lifts
 humanity out of disease and death and inspires faith.
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_548"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 548</font></a></p><p></p><p>"The Spirit and the bride say, Come! . . . and whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely." Christian
 Science separates error from truth, and breathes
 through the sacred pages the spiritual sense of
 life, substance, and intelligence. In this Science, we discover man in the image and likeness of God. We see that
 man has never lost his spiritual estate and his eternal
 harmony.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The clouds dissolving</font></p>
 How little light or heat reach our earth when clouds
 cover the sun's face! So Christian Science can be seen
 only as the clouds of corporeal sense roll away.
 Earth has little light or joy for mortals before
 Life is spiritually learned. Every agony of mortal error
 helps error to destroy error, and so aids the apprehension
 of immortal Truth. This is the new birth going on
 hourly, by which men may entertain angels, the true
 ideas of God, the spiritual sense of being.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Prediction of a naturalist</font></p>
 Speaking of the origin of mortals, a famous naturalist
 says: "It is very possible that many general statements
 now current, about birth and generation, will
 be changed with the progress of information."
 Had the naturalist, through his tireless researches, gained
 the diviner side in Christian Science,--so far apart from
 his material sense of animal growth and organization, he would have blessed the human race more abundantly.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Methods of reproduction</font></p>
 Natural history is richly endowed by the labors and
 genius of great men. Modern discoveries have brought
 to light important facts in regard to so-called
 embryonic life. Agassiz declares ("Methods
 of Study in Natural History," page 275): "Certain animals, besides the ordinary process of generation, also
 increase their numbers naturally and constantly by self<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_549"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 549</font></a></p><p></p><p>division." This discovery is corroborative of the Science
 of Mind, for this discovery shows that the multiplication
 of certain animals takes place apart from sexual conditions. The supposition that life germinates in eggs and
 must decay after it has grown to maturity, if not before,
 is shown by divine metaphysics to be a mistake,--a
 blunder which will finally give place to higher theories
 and demonstrations.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The three processes</font></p>
 Creatures of lower forms of organism are supposed
 to have, as classes, three different methods of reproduction and to multiply their species sometimes
 through eggs, sometimes through buds, and
 sometimes through self-division. According to recent
 lore, successive generations do not begin with the birth of
 new individuals, or personalities, but with the formation
 of the nucleus, or egg, from which one or more individualities subsequently emerge; and we must therefore look
 upon the simple ovum as the germ, the starting-point, of
 the most complicated corporeal structures, including those
 which we call human. Here these material researches
 culminate in such vague hypotheses as must necessarily
 attend false systems, which rely upon physics and are devoid of metaphysics.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Deference to material law</font></p>
 In one instance a celebrated naturalist, Agassiz, discovers the pathway leading to divine Science, and beards
 the lion of materialism in its den. At that
 point, however, even this great observer mistakes nature, forsakes Spirit as the divine origin of
 creative Truth, and allows matter and material law to
 usurp the prerogatives of omnipotence. He absolutely
 drops from his summit, coming down to a belief in the
 material origin of man, for he virtually affirms that
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_550"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 550</font></a></p><p></p><p>the germ of humanity is in a circumscribed and nonintelligent egg.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Deep-reaching interrogations</font></p>
 If this be so, whence cometh Life, or Mind, to the
 human race? Matter surely does not possess Mind.
 God is the Life, or intelligence, which forms
 and preserves the individuality and identity
 of animals as well as of men. God cannot
 become finite, and be limited within material bounds.
 Spirit cannot become matter, nor can Spirit be developed
 through its opposite. Of what avail is it to investigate
 what is miscalled material life, which ends, even as it begins, in nameless nothingness? The true sense of being
 and its eternal perfection should appear now, even as it
 will hereafter.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Stages of existence</font></p>
 Error of thought is reflected in error of action. The
 continual contemplation of existence as material and corporeal--as beginning and ending, and with
 birth, decay, and dissolution as its component
 stages--hides the true and spiritual Life, and causes
 our standard to trail in the dust. If Life has any startingpoint whatsoever, then the great I AM is a myth. If Life
 is God, as the Scriptures imply, then Life is not embryonic, it is infinite. An egg is an impossible enclosure for
 Deity.
 <p></p><p>Embryology supplies no instance of one species producing its opposite. A serpent never begets a bird, nor
 does a lion bring forth a lamb. Amalgamation is deemed
 monstrous and is seldom fruitful, but it is not so hideous
 and absurd as the supposition that Spirit--the pure and
 holy, the immutable and immortal--can originate the
 impure and mortal and dwell in it. As Christian Science
 repudiates self-evident impossibilities, the material senses
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_551"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 551</font></a></p><p></p><p>must father these absurdities, for both the material senses 
 and their reports are unnatural, impossible, and unreal.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The real producer</font></p>
 Either Mind produces, or it is produced. If Mind is
 first, it cannot produce its opposite in quality and quantity,
 called matter. If matter is first, it cannot produce Mind. Like produces like. In natural  
 history, the bird is not the product of a beast. In spiritual
 history, matter is not the progenitor of Mind.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The ascent of species</font></p>
 One distinguished naturalist argues that mortals spring 
 from eggs and in races. Mr. Darwin admits this, but he
 adds that mankind has ascended through all 
 the lower grades of existence. Evolution describes the gradations of human belief, but it does not
 acknowledge the method of divine Mind, nor see that material methods are impossible in divine Science and that 
 all Science is of God, not of man.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Transmitted peculiarities</font></p>
 Naturalists ask: "What can there be, of a material
 nature, transmitted through these bodies called eggs, themselves composed of the simplest material 
 elements,--by which all peculiarities of an-  
 cestry, belonging to either sex, are brought down from
 generation to generation?" The question of the naturalist amounts to this: How can matter originate or transmit mind? We answer that it cannot. Darkness and 
 doubt encompass thought, so long as it bases creation on
 materiality. From a material standpoint, "Canst thou
 by searching find out God?" All must be Mind, or 
 else all must be matter. Neither can produce the other.
 Mind is immortal; but error declares that the material
 seed must decay in order to propagate its species, and
 the resulting germ is doomed to the same routine.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Causation not in matter</font></p>
 The ancient and hypothetical question, Which is first,
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_552%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 552 </font></a></p><p></p><p>the egg or the bird? is answered, if the egg produces the
 parent. But we cannot stop here. Another question
 follows: Who or what produces the parent of
 the egg? That the earth was hatched from the
 "egg of night" was once an accepted theory. Heathen
 philosophy, modern geology, and all other material hypotheses deal with causation as contingent on matter
 and as necessarily apparent to the corporeal senses, even
 where the proof requisite to sustain this assumption is undiscovered. Mortal theories make friends of sin, sickness,
 and death; whereas the spiritual scientific facts of existence include no member of this dolorous and fatal triad.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Emergence of mortals</font></p>
 Human experience in mortal life, which starts from an
 egg, corresponds with that of Job, when he says, "Man
 that is born of a woman is of few days, and
 full of trouble." Mortals must emerge from
 this notion of material life as all-in-all. They must peck
 open their shells with Christian Science, and look outward
 and upward. But thought, loosened from a material
 basis but not yet instructed by Science, may become wild
 with freedom and so be self-contradictory.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Persistence of species</font></p>
 From a material source flows no remedy for sorrow,
 sin, and death, for the redeeming power, from the ills
 they occasion, is not in egg nor in dust. The
 blending tints of leaf and flower show the
 order of matter to be the order of mortal mind. The
 intermixture of different species, urged to its utmost
 limits, results in a return to the original species. Thus
 it is learned that matter is a manifestation of mortal
 mind, and that matter always surrenders its claims when
 the perfect and eternal Mind is understood.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Better basis than embryology</font></p>
 Naturalists describe the origin of mortal and material
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_553"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 553</font></a></p><p></p><p>existence in the various forms of embryology, and accompany their descriptions with important observations,
 which should awaken thought to a higher and 
 purer contemplation of man's origin. This 
 clearer consciousness must precede an understanding of the harmony of being. Mortal thought must
 obtain a better basis, get nearer the truth of being, or
 health will never be universal, and harmony will never
 become the standard of man.   
  
 One of our ablest naturalists has said: "We have no
 right to assume that individuals have grown or been
 formed under circumstances which made material conditions essential to their maintenance and reproduction,
 or important to their origin and first introduction."
 Why, then, is the naturalist's basis so materialistic, 
 and why are his deductions generally material?
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">All nativity in thought</font></p>
 Adam was created before Eve. In this instance, it is
 seen that the maternal egg never brought forth Adam. 
 Eve was formed from Adam's rib, not from a 
 foetal ovum. Whatever theory may be adopted 
 by general mortal thought to account for human origin, 
 that theory is sure to become the signal for the appearance of its method in finite forms and operations. If consentaneous human belief agrees upon an ovum as the 
 point of emergence for the human race, this potent belief
 will immediately supersede the more ancient superstition about the creation from dust or from the rib of our
 primeval father.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Being is immortal</font></p>
 You may say that mortals are formed before they
 think or know aught of their origin, and you 
 may also ask how belief can affect a result 
 which precedes the development of that belief. It can
 <p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_554%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 554 </font></a></p><p></p><p>only be replied, that Christian Science reveals what "eye
 hath not seen,"--even the cause of all that exists,--for
 the universe, inclusive of man, is as eternal as God, who
 is its divine immortal Principle. There is no such thing
 as mortality, nor are there properly any mortal beings,
 because being is immortal, like Deity,--or, rather, being
 and Deity are inseparable.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Our conscious development</font></p>
 Error is always error. It is no thing. Any statement
 of life, following from a misconception of life, is erroneous, because it is destitute of any knowledge
 of the so-called selfhood of life, destitute of
 any knowledge of its origin or existence. The mortal
 is unconscious of his foetal and infantile existence; but
 as he grows up into another false claim, that of self-conscious matter, he learns to say, "I am somebody; but
 who made me?" Error replies, "God made you." The
 first effort of error has been and is to impute to God the
 creation of whatever is sinful and mortal; but infinite
 Mind sets at naught such a mistaken belief.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Mendacity of error</font></p>
 Jesus defined this opposite of God and His creation
 better than we can, when he said, "He is a liar, and the
 father of it." Jesus also said, "Have not I
 chosen you twelve, and one of you is a devil?"
 This he said of Judas, one of Adam's race. Jesus never
 intimated that God made a devil, but he did say, "Ye
 are of your father, the devil." All these sayings were to
 show that mind in matter is the author of itself, and is
 simply a falsity and illusion.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ailments of animals</font></p>
 It is the general belief that the lower animals are less
 sickly than those possessing higher organizations, especially those of the human form.
 This would indicate that there is less disease in propor<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_555"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 555</font></a></p><p></p><p>tion as the force of mortal mind is less pungent or sensitive, and that health attends the absence of mortal mind.
 A fair conclusion from this might be, that it is the human 
 belief, and not the divine arbitrament, which brings the
 physical organism under the yoke of disease.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ignorance the sign of error</font></p>
 An inquirer once said to the discoverer of Christian
 Science: "I like your explanations of truth, but I do
 not comprehend what you say about error." 
 This is the nature of error. The mark of ignorance is on its forehead, for it neither understands nor
 can be understood. Error would have itself received as
 mind, as if it were as real and God-created as truth; but 
 Christian Science attributes to error neither entity nor
 power, because error is neither mind nor the outcome of
 Mind.         
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The origin of divinity   </font></p>
 Searching for the origin of man, who is the reflection
 of God, is like inquiring into the origin of God, the selfexistent and eternal. Only impotent error 
 would seek to unite Spirit with matter, good 
 with evil, immortality with mortality, and call this
 sham unity man, as if man were the offspring of both 
 Mind and matter, of both Deity and humanity. Creation rests on a spiritual basis. We lose our standard of
 perfection and set aside the proper conception of Deity, 
 when we admit that the perfect is the author of aught
 that can become imperfect, that God bestows the power
 to sin, or that Truth confers the ability to err. Our 
 great example, Jesus, could restore the individualized
 manifestation of existence, which seemed to vanish in
 death. Knowing that God was the Life of man, Jesus 
 was able to present himself unchanged after the crucifixion. Truth fosters the idea of Truth, and not the be<p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_556%20"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 556 </font></a></p><p></p><p>lief in illusion or error. That which is real, is sustained
 by Spirit.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Genera classified</font></p>
 Vertebrata, articulata, mollusca, and radiata are mortal and material concepts classified, and are supposed to
 possess life and mind. These false beliefs
 will disappear, when the radiation of Spirit
 destroys forever all belief in intelligent matter. Then
 will the new heaven and new earth appear, for the former things will have passed away.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The Christian's privilege</font></p>
 Mortal belief infolds the conditions of sin. Mortal
 belief dies to live again in renewed forms, only to go out
 at last forever; for life everlasting is not to be
 gained by dying. Christian Science may absorb the attention of sage and philosopher, but
 the Christian alone can fathom it. It is made known
 most fully to him who understands best the divine Life.
 Did the origin and the enlightenment of the race come
 from the deep sleep which fell upon Adam? Sleep is
 darkness, but God's creative mandate was, "Let there be
 light." In sleep, cause and effect are mere illusions.
 They seem to be something, but are not. Oblivion and
 dreams, not realities, come with sleep. Even so goes on
 the Adam-belief, of which mortal and material life is the
 dream.
 <p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">Ontology versus physiology</font></p>
 Ontology receives less attention than physiology. Why?
 Because mortal mind must waken to spiritual
 life before it cares to solve the problem of
 being, hence the author's experience; but when
 that awakening comes, existence will be on a new standpoint.
 <p>It is related that a father plunged his infant babe, only
 a few hours old, into the water for several minutes, and
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><a name="pg_557"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 557</font></a></p><p></p><p>repeated this operation daily, until the child could remain
 under water twenty minutes, moving and playing without harm, like a fish. Parents should remember this 
 and learn how to develop their children properly on dry
 land.
 </p><p></p><p></p><p><font size="1">The curse removed</font></p>
 Mind controls the birth-throes in the lower realms of 
 nature, where parturition is without suffering. Vegetables, minerals, and many animals suffer no 
 pain in multiplying; but human propagation 
 has its suffering because it is a false belief. Christian Science reveals harmony as proportionately increasing as the
 line of creation rises towards spiritual man,--towards 
 enlarged understanding and intelligence; but in the line
 of the corporeal senses, the less a mortal knows of sin,
 disease, and mortality, the better for him,--the less pain 
 and sorrow are his. When the mist of mortal mind evaporates, the curse will be removed which says to woman,
 "In sorrow thou shalt bring forth children." Divine
 Science rolls back the clouds of error with the light of
 Truth, and lifts the curtain on man as never born and as
 never dying, but as coexistent with his creator.  
   
 Popular theology takes up the history of man as if he
 began materially right, but immediately fell into mental
 sin; whereas revealed religion proclaims the Science of 
 Mind and its formations as being in accordance with
 the first chapter of the Old Testament, when God, Mind,
 spake and it was done.
