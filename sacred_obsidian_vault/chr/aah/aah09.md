 <p>[<i>This 'Epistle' was published by Alexander Pope in 1717, and is given here because through it alone has the tragedy of the unfortunate lovers been so far known to the mass of the English public. The 'Epistle' is marvellously exact in its rendering of many of the phrases of Heloise, and is an apt example of how rhyming couplets can turn into trite commonplaces the most marvellous expressions of human passion that literature contains</i>.]</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>IN these deep solitudes and awful cells,<br> Where heav’nly-pensive contemplation dwells,<br> And ever-musing melancholy reigns;<br> What means this tumult in a Vestal’s veins?<br> Why rove my thoughts beyond this last retreat?<br> Why feels my heart its long-forgotten heat?<br> Yet, yet I love!--From Abelard it came,<br> And Eloïsa yet must kiss the name.<br>   Dear fatal name! rest ever unrevealed,<br> Nor pass these lips in holy silence sealed:<br> Hide it, my heart, within that close disguise,<br> Where mix’d with God’s, his lov’d Idea lies:<br> O write it not my hand--the name appears<br> Already written--wash it out, my tears!<br> In vain lost Eloïsa weeps and prays.<br> Her heart still dictates, and her hand obeys.<br>   Relentless walls! whose darksome round contains<br> Repentant sighs, and voluntary pains;<br> Ye rugged rock! which holy knees have worn;<br> Ye grots and caverns shagg’d with horrid thorn!<br> Shrines! where their vigils pale-ey’d virgins keep,<br> And pitying saints, whose statues learn to weep! <a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="green">p. 98</font></a><br> Tho’ cold like you, unmov’d and silent grown,<br> I have not yet forgot myself to stone.<br> All is not Heav’n's while Abelard has part,<br> Still rebel nature holds out half my heart;<br> Nor pray’rs nor fasts its stubborn pulse restrain,<br> Nor tears for ages taught to flow in vain.<br>   Soon as thy letters trembling I unclose,<br> That well-known name awakens all my woes.<br> O name for ever sad! for ever dear!<br> Still breath’d in sighs, still usher’d with a tear.<br> I tremble too, where’er my own I find,<br> Some dire misfortune follows close behind.<br> Line after line my gushing eyes o’erflow,<br> Led thro’ a sad variety of woe:<br> Now warm in love, now with’ring in my bloom,<br> Lost in a convent’s solitary gloom!<br> There stern Religion quench’d th’ unwilling flame,<br> There died the best of passions, Love and Fame.<br>   Yet write, oh write me all, that I may join<br> Griefs to thy griefs, and echo sighs to thine.<br> Nor foes nor fortune take this pow’r away;<br> And is my Abelard less kind than they?<br> Tears still are mine, and those I need not spare,<br> Love but demands what else were shed in pray’r;<br> No happier task these faded eyes pursue:<br> To read and weep is all they now can do.<br>   Then share thy pain, allow that sad relief;<br> Ah, more than share it, give me all thy grief.<br> Heav’n first taught letters for some wretch’s aid,<br> Some banish’d lover, or some captive maid;<br> They live, they speak, they breathe what love inspires, <a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="green">p. 99</font></a><br> Warm from the soul, and faithful to its fires,<br> The virgin’s wish without her fears impart,<br> Excuse the blush, and pour out all the heart,<br> Speed the soft intercourse from soul to soul,<br> And waft a sigh from Indus to the Pole.<br>   Thou know’st how guiltless first I met thy flame,<br> When Love approach’d me under Friendship’s name;<br> My fancy form’d thee of angelic kind,<br> Some emanation of th’ all-beauteous Mind.<br> Those smiling eyes, attemp’ring ev’ry ray,<br> Shone sweetly lambent with celestial day.<br> Guiltless I gaz’d; Heav’n listen’d while you sung;<br> And truths divine came mended from that tongue.<br> From lips like those what precept fail’d to move?<br> Too soon they taught me ’twas no sin to love:<br> Back thro’ the paths of pleasing sense I ran,<br> Nor wish’d an Angel whom I lov’d a Man.<br> Dim and remote the joys of saints I see;<br> Nor envy them that heav’n I lose for thee.<br>   How oft, when press’d to marriage, have I said,<br> Curse on all laws but those which love has made?<br> Love, free as air, at sight of human ties,<br> Spreads his light wings, and in a moment flies.<br> Let wealth, let honour, wait the wedded dame,<br> August her deed, and sacred be her fame;<br> Before true passion all those views remove, <a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="green">p. 100</font></a><br> Fame, wealth, and honour! what are you to Love?<br> The jealous God, when we profane His fires,<br> Those restless passions in revenge inspires,<br> And bids them make mistaken mortals groan,<br> Who seek in love for aught but love alone.<br> Should at my feet the world’s great Master fall,<br> Himself, His throne, His world, I’d scorn ’em all:<br> Not Cæsar’s empress would I deign to prove;<br> No, make me mistress to the man I love;<br> If there be yet another name more free,<br> More fond than mistress, make me that to thee!<br> Oh! happy state! when souls each other draw,<br> When love is liberty, and nature law:<br> All then is full, possessing and possess’d,<br> No craving void left aching in the breast:<br> Ev’n thought meets thought, ere from the lips it part,<br> And each warm wish springs mutual from the heart.<br> This sure is bliss (if bliss on earth there be),<br> And once the lot of Abelard and me.<br> Alas, how chang’d! what sudden horrors rise!<br> A naked Lover bound and bleeding lies!<br> Where, where was Eloïse! her voice, her hand,<br> Her poniard, had oppos’d the dire command.<br> Barbarian, stay! that bloody stroke restrain;<br> The crime was common, common be the pain.<br> I can no more; by shame, by rage suppress’d,<br> Let tears, and burning blushes speak the rest.<br>   Canst thou forget that sad, that solemn day,<br> When victims at yon altar’s foot we lay? <a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="green">p. 101</font></a><br> Canst thou forget what tears that moment fell,<br> When, warm in youth, I bade the world farewell?<br> As with cold lips I kiss’d the sacred veil,<br> The shrines all trembled, and the lamps grew pale:<br> Heav’n scarce believ’d the Conquest it survey’d,<br> And Saints with wonder heard the vows I made,<br> Yet then, to those dread altars as I drew,<br> Not on the Cross my eyes were fix’d, but you:<br> Not grace, or zeal, love only was my call,<br> And if I lose thy love, I lose my all.<br> Come! with thy looks, thy words, relieve my woe; <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a>
 <br> Those still at least are left thee to bestow.<br> Still on thy breast enamour’d let me lie,<br> Still drink delicious poison from thy eye,<br> Pant on thy lip, and to thy heart be press’d;<br> Give all thou canst--and let me dream the rest.<br> Ah no! instruct me other joys to prize,<br> With other beauties charm my partial eyes,<br> Full in my view set all the bright abode,<br> And make my soul quit Abelard for God.<br>   Ah, think at least thy flock deserves thy care,<br> Plants of thy hand, and children of thy pray’r.<br> From the false world in early youth they fled,<br> By thee to mountains, wilds, and deserts led.<br> You rais’d these hallow’d walls; the desert smil’d,<br> And Paradise was open’d in the Wild. <a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="green">p. 102</font></a><br> No weeping orphan saw his father’s stores<br> Our shrines irradiate, or emblaze the floors;<br> No silver saints, by dying misers giv’n,<br> Here brib’d the rage of ill-requited Heav’n:<br> But such plain roofs as Piety could raise,<br> And only vocal with the Maker’s praise.<br> In these lone walls (their days eternal bound)<br> These moss-grown domes with spiry turrets crown’d,<br> Where awful arches make a noon-day night,<br> And the dim windows shed a solemn light;<br> Thy eyes diffus’d a reconciling ray,<br> And gleams of glory brighten’d all the day.<br> But now no face divine contentment wears,<br> ’Tis all blank sadness, or continual tears.<br> See how the force of others' pray’rs I try<br> (O pious fraud of am’rous charity!),<br> But why should I on others’ pray’rs depend?<br> Come thou, my father, brother, husband, friend!<br> Ah let thy handmaid, sister, daughter move,<br> And all those tender names in one, thy love!<br> The darksome pines that o’er yon rocks reclin’d<br> Wave high, and murmur to the hollow wind,<br> The wand’ring streams that shine between the hills,<br> The grots that echo to the tinkling rills,<br> The dying gales that pant upon the trees,<br> The lakes that quiver to the curling breeze;<br> No more these scenes my meditation aid,<br> Or lull to rest the visionary maid.<br> But o’er the twilight groves and dusky caves,<br> Long-sounding aisles, and intermingled graves,<br> Black Melancholy sits, and round her throws <a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="green">p. 103</font></a><br> A death-like silence, and a dead repose:<br> Her gloomy presence saddens all the scene,<br> Shades ev’ry flow’r, and darkens ev’ry green,<br> Deepens the murmur of the falling floods,<br> And breathes a browner horror on the woods.<br>   Yet here for ever, ever must I stay;<br> Sad proof how well a lover can obey!<br> Death, only death, can break the lasting chain:<br> And here, ev’n then, shall my cold dust remain,<br> Here all its frailties, all its flames resign,<br> And wait till ’tis no sin to mix with thine,<br>   Ah wretch! believ’d the spouse of God in vain,<br> Confess’d within the slave of love and man.<br> Assist me, Heav’n! but whence arose that pray’r?<br> Sprung it from piety, or from despair?<br> Ev’n here, where frozen chastity retires,<br> Love finds an altar for forbidden fires.<br> I ought to grieve, but cannot what I ought;<br> I mourn the lover, not lament the fault;<br> I view my crime, but kindle at the view,<br> Repent old pleasures, and solicit new;<br> Now turn’d to Heav’n, I weep my past offence,<br> Now think of thee, and curse my innocence.<br> Of all affliction taught a lover yet,<br> ’Tis sure the hardest science to forget!<br> How shall I lose the sin, yet keep the sense,<br> And love th’ offender, yet detest th’ offence?<br> How the dear object from the crime remove,<br> Or how distinguish penitence from love?<br> Unequal task! a passion to resign,<br> For hearts so touch’d, so pierc’d, so lost as mine.<a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="green">p. 104</font></a><br> Ere such a soul regains its peaceful state,<br> How often must it love, how often hate!<br> How often hope, despair, resent, regret,<br> Conceal, disdain,--do all things but forget.<br> But let Heav’n seize it, all at once ’tis fir’d;<br> Not touch’d, but rapt; not waken’d, but inspir’d!<br> Oh come?
