 <h2 align="CENTER">THE CHURCH</h2>
 <p>WHAT then is S. Augustine's view of the place of the Church in relation to
 civil society? This is part of the topic of the last lecture. Only to-day we
 look at the matter from a different angle. Here too, a <i>caveat </i>must be
 entered. We must beware of treating anything said of the <i>Civitas Dei </i>as
 though it could be applied to the existing ecclesiastical system. Much of it
 can. Yet the <i>Civitas Dei </i>in its strict sense is not the Visible Church.
 It is the <i>communio sanctorum, </i>the body of the elect, many of whom are to
 be found in pre-Christian times or in heathen peoples--while from this body
 many among the baptised will be excluded.[<a name="text01" href="#foot01">1</a>]
 This <i>communio sanctorum </i>is the true recipient of the promises to David
 and of the gifts of eternal peace and beatitude, those promises which Augustine
 sets forth with moving eloquence in Book XX.<b> </b>The Visible Militant Church
 is never more than a part of either--nor does it ever attain. Its peace and
 beatitude are in hope. It is always <i>in via.</i> It is but the symbolic and
 inadequate representative of the <i>Civitas Dei,</i>but it uses the peace
 provided by the earthly State.[<a name="text02" href="#foot02">2</a>] Still we
 must beware of laying too much stress on this. Reuter overstrains it. Augustine,
 it appears to be proved, is the first of the fathers to declare that the Church
 is the Kingdom of God on earth. The most important of the passages is that in XX.
 9. There Augustine is arguing for the identification of the Church with the
 millennial kingdom (as against the Chiliasts) and for the rulers of the Church
 sitting on thrones. He says explicitly:</p>
 <p>'Ergo ecclesia et nunc est regnum Christi regnumque caelorum.' [<a name="text03" href="#foot03">3</a>]</p>
 <p>Other passages also state this identification of the Church with the <i>Civitas
 Dei. </i>Reuter will have it that all these are to be understood of the Church
 only as <i>communio sanctorum</i>.[<a name="text04" href="#foot04">4</a>]<i> </i>Therefore
 we must rule out every inference that might be drawn from the application of the
 idea of the Kingdom to the actual Church Militant. This interpretation cannot be
 proved. There is little doubt, from the context, that Augustine was thinking, as
 Scholz and Seidel say, of the Church as a visible, comprehensible body,
 hierarchically organised.</p>
 <p>Dr. Cunningham's Hulsean Lectures afford us an instance of the opposite view
 (p. 116).</p>
 <p>'For S. Austin the Kingdom of God was not a mere hope, but a present reality;
 not a mere name for a divine idea, but an institution, duly organised among men,
 subsisting from one generation to another; closely inter-connected with earthly
 rule, with definite guidance to give, and a definite part to take, in all the
 affairs of actual life. To him the Kingdom of God was an actual Polity, just as
 the Roman Empire was a Polity too; it was "visible" in just the same
 way in the earthly State, for it was a real institution with a definite
 organisation, with a recognised constitution, with a code of laws and means of
 enforcing them, with property for its uses and officers to direct it.'</p>
 <p>Here then are the two opposing views. I take another Point. Both Reuter and
 Troeltsch argue that while Augustine accepted the authority of the Church and
 had no wish to change it--they were the presuppositions of his life as a
 Christian--yet he meant little by them:</p>
 <p>that his emphasis upon predestination makes against any high view of
 ecclesiastical order. Repeatedly in his writings, <i>e.g. </i>in the 'De
 Catechizandis Rudibus,' Augustine lays stress on the fact that the elect will
 include men of all nations and every age. At the beginning of the 'De Civitate'
 he declares that the <i>Civitas Dei </i>began with the beginning of the world.
 Reuter (who is a Protestant) goes so far as to say, that of all early Catholic
 writers hardly any is so little hierarchically minded as Augustine. It is true
 that Augustine takes little interest in hierarchical topics. Never, so far as I
 know, does he develop the theory of the episcopate in the way in which S.
 Cyprian did. When he thinks of the Church, it is of the whole body of the
 faithful. It is the bigness of it that appeals to him, and to which he appeals.
 Whatever his views in favour of small States, in regard to the Church he is
 imperialist enough; he is opposed to all particularism. It is to this sense of
 universality, rather than to that of the episcopate, that he appeals. Still, it
 is of the Church as an organised body, hierarchically governed, that he thinks
 in his controversy with the Donatists. His strong views of the predestination of
 individuals no more upset his scheme of a visible Church than did those of
 Calvin. Calvin threw over the ancient system, and rejected both the Papacy and
 the Episcopacy; but no less strongly than S. Augustine did he hold to a doctrine
 of a Visible Church and its authority. So did the Jansenists. It seems little
 short of ridiculous to deny that the notion of the Church loomed large to
 Augustine's imagination, much larger than it did to that of Origen and the
 earlier apologists; or that, along with the doctrine of original sin, it was the
 pivot of his system.[<a name="text05" href="#foot05">5</a>] It had been to the
 Catholic Church that he had been converted after trying many experiments.</p>
 <p>Rightly has it been pointed out by Schmidt[<a name="text06" href="#foot06">6</a>]
 and Weinand[<a name="text07" href="#foot07">7</a>] that it was the Donatist
 schism that aroused the Church as a society to full self-consciousness. All the
 earlier heresies concerned high doctrine. Certain statements about our Lord or
 the Trinity were, or were alleged to be, false. In opposition to them, the
 Church is primarily a teacher. But the Donatists were not heretics in the
 ordinary sense. Or rather their heresy was on the topic of the Church. Augustine
 was faced with (<i>a</i>)<i> </i>a doctrine of the sacraments which reduced
 religion to personal influence and is, in our modern phrase, radically
 Protestant; and (<i>b</i>)<i> </i>with the claim of the Donatist schism to be
 the true Church of Africa. Against these claims he was forced to develop the
 idea of the Church as being something more than a company of believers, as the
 sphere of God's work, the <i>Civitas Dei</i>; and of the sacraments as God's
 work done by human agents, the character of whom no more affected their validity
 than does that of an officer in the army the validity of his orders. Further,
 the Church as a universal world-wide polity is opposed to all particularist,
 nationalist tendencies. In the early years of the fifth century it looked as
 though Donatism was to be the national religion of Africa. This contest was a
 conflict between Catholicity in its very idea, and conceptions which were its
 antithesis.</p>
 <p>These ideas of S. Augustine need not have been new. It is not their novelty
 which makes the difference, but the emphasis with which they are stressed.
 Further, the term <i>Civitas Dei </i>is itself significant. This is not new. It
 can be seen in the New Testament, in Hebrews, and the Apocalypse. The vogue
 given to these words now caused more and more assimilation of the Church to a
 State. All the qualifications were left out of account. This process led to a
 political habit of treating the Church. By the mere use of the terms <i>civitas </i>and
 <i>regnum </i>in a work of such momentous influence, Augustine prepared the way
 for the later development of the doctrine that the Church is a <i>societas
 perfecta, </i>and must have the powers necessary to any self-sufficing
 community. The conception of the Church as a social entity wielding governing
 powers owes much to S. Augustine. He did much to strengthen the Church as an
 imperial force.</p>
 <p>If we take two nineteenth-century writers, one in the East and one in the
 West, who thought much about the Church, Khomiakoff and Newman, what a wide gulf
 there is between them! Newman's sermons, in the volume of the famous fifteen on
 the Church as an imperial power, show how far the West has gone in this
 political way of thinking about the Church. Augustine may be said to have been
 one of the great forces which began this development. Meanwhile the East
 remained as it had been, preserving the view that the laity form a real part of
 the organisation.</p>
 <p>Ritschl thought that Augustine's emphasis on the Church was the necessary
 corollary of the doctrine of original sin--the setting up of the society of
 grace. I cannot see this. Grace might be conceived as acting merely on the
 individual; and all importance be denied to the Church. Some even have based
 such a doctrine on S. Augustine.</p>
 <p>But he did think that the Church, the Visible Church, recruited by baptism,
 nourished by sacraments, governed by bishops, was the one true family of God ;
 and that Christianity meant belonging to that family. The actual expression <i>extra
 ecclesiam nulla salus </i>is not his. But the principle he definitely states.
 When you add to this the view that the Church was the <i>regnum Dei, </i>and
 that the millennial kingdom of Christ was exercised by the rulers of the Church,
 you can see how much was latent in S. Augustine of the political aspect of
 Christianity.</p>
 <p>More momentous is Augustine's treatment of the Church as the apocalyptic
 kingdom. This doctrine he develops against the Chiliasts, scouting their notion
 of an earthly physical reign of our Lord visible on earth. The opposing party
 was important at that time, and some alternative interpretation of the biblical
 passages was needed. Augustine seems to have taken the doctrine from Tyconius.
 This Tyconius was a Donatist with whom Augustine stood on friendly terms.
 Moreover, he had quarrelled with those of the more extreme tendencies. Augustine
 indeed wonders why he did not become a Catholic. In the 'Rules of Tyconius' we
 have found (as I said earlier) Augustine's doctrine of the two Cities, and the
 conception of the bipartite character of the City of God, <i>i.e. </i>consisting
 of the elect and the foredoomed. Above all, Augustine's interpretation of the
 Apocalypse is found to be derived from Tyconius, who wrote a treatise on the
 Apocalypse, which now has been lost, but has been partly restored by conjecture.</p>
 <p>The point of this exposition is that the millennial kingdom is already in
 existence. It is a reign, therefore, that does not involve the physical presence
 of Christ. In other words, the Second Coming is the Church. The First
 Resurrection has already taken place in the conversion of sinners and in their
 baptism. It is a spiritual act, not a physical resurrection. In his
 interpretation of Scripture Augustine oscillates between extreme literalism and
 a remarkable freedom. The martyrs are those who reign with Christ. The thrones
 belong to the rulers of the Church. This kingdom has been in existence ever
 since Christianity spread beyond Judaea. It has nothing to do with the peace of
 the Church and the cessation of persecution, still less with the legal
 establishment of Christianity. Neither persecution nor any other earthly act
 affects this.</p>
 <p>The ground for rejecting Chiliasm is that it postulates an absence of earthly
 trials in this life--a thing which Augustine declares to be no less impossible
 for saints than anyone else: and for that reason the promises that there shall
 be no more sorrow nor crying can apply only to the Church Triumphant. Now this
 argument cuts two ways. If the Church be the Kingdom of God, it may, it is held,
 justify claims to paramount supremacy, and lead to a great Church-State. A more
 natural interpretation points the other way. If Christ has been reigning on
 earth, through the Church, ever since the days of Antioch, then he was reigning
 all through the period of persecution. Therefore for the Church to exercise any
 political supremacy, or even secure any recognition of its existence, are shown
 to be things indifferent. The royalty of the Church, 'the peculiar people, the
 holy nation, the royal priesthood,' the power on earth of the King of Kings and
 Lord of Lords, is of the same nature as that of which Christ spoke when He
 answered Pilate's satirical question--'Art thou a King then 'with' My Kingdom
 is not of this world.' The Kingdom of God cometh not by observation, and its
 authority is in the souls of men, not in any outward political structure. It was
 regal in her days of security, regal when she was a distinct society in the
 second century, regal when she was assailed by the whole might of Rome under
 Diocletian, regal when having conquered by stooping she enjoyed a guaranteed
 security, regal when under Julian that security was threatened once more, or
 when under Arians, like Constantius or Valens, it was undermined from within,
 regal no more and no less than it had been previously now that after the laws of
 Gratian and Theodosius she had become not merely tolerated but established, not
 merely established but the exclusive official religion of the Empire.</p>
 <p>The Church is a kingdom not of this world. Augustine goes out of his way to
 say that kings and princes cannot make the City of God, which comes by the
 calling of souls. Once more it must be said that Augustine was not thinking how
 to build Jerusalem in Afric's bright and sunny land, but how to wean men from
 'crying "peace, peace" when there was no peace,' from seeking in any
 earthly refuge that abiding home which remaineth for the people of God. Richard
 Baxter's great book, 'The Saints' Everlasting Rest,' reflects the aim and many
 of the ideas of S. Augustine or the famous poem of Bernard of Murles, from which
 is taken the hymn 'Jerusalem the Golden.' This non-political interpretation of
 the symbolic kingdom is seen to be that which is in accordance with the mind of
 S. Augustine, if we take the book as a whole. It is what he meant to mean;
 whether it is always what his words did mean, is another question.</p>
 <p>But evidence that tells on the other side is not to be neglected. First, it
 is obviously possible to put a clericalist interpretation upon the passages
 about justice. Next, it must be remembered that he speaks of the good that has
 been done to the Church by Christian kings. In reply to Petilian he says that he
 does not give unreserved trust to the State, but makes use of it. He admits the
 change which had come over the Empire since Constantine. He says that, since
 ruling is the <i>métier </i>of princes, they, if they come over to the Church,
 must forward her interests by laws in her favour. In other places he speaks of
 the duty of the civil governor to do what the Church requires in her interests.
 Now one commentator thinks that all this amounts to not much less than the
 comparison of Church and State to sun and moon, which was first found, I think,
 in Hildebrand,[<a name="text08" href="#foot08">8</a>] and became so dear to the
 Middle Ages. But I confess that I can see nothing here that in any sense
 approaches to the doctrine of the two swords, or even to the famous argument of
 Gelasius.</p>
 <p>The Church was not yet in a condition even of parity with the civil power.
 Augustine does not think of the civil and ecclesiastical authorities as two
 co-ordinate Powers occupied in governing. Even in dream he had not the great
 vision of mediæval imagination, the one commonwealth of Catholic Christians,
 with its twin heads of Pope and Emperor; though he does say that there is one <i>respublica
 </i>of all Christians. It is doubtful whether he hoped to convert the heathen by
 force, though he asks the Donatists whether they did not agree with him in
 approving the imperial laws against heathen sacrifice. Augustine appeals to the
 unity of the Church, the <i>Civitas Dei </i>alike in morals and thought and sets
 this against the intellectual and moral anarchy of the terrene State; yet he is
 not at that moment thinking of an imperial Christ-state, but pointing to actual
 phenomena as a modern Roman Catholic in England or the United States might do.
 Yet it is not doubtful that it was possible in later times, and indeed natural,
 to press all this into the service of the hierarchical organisation of the
 world.</p>
 <p>Most of Augustine's writing is not in the tone of a ruling Church, but rather
 of a body officially predominant, though everywhere attacked. His attitude to
 Count Boniface is not like that of the mediæval popes.</p>
 <p>It is the other world with which he is concerned. He might have called his
 book 'The Gospel of the Resurrection.' The 'De Civitate Dei' is chargeable with
 whatever plaints can be made against a tendency to other-world lines. The
 strongest passage on this point is not to be found there, but in the 'De Bono
 Conjugali.' Answering the objection that if his views were correct, and if
 enough people became converted to the celibate life, the world could not go on
 being peopled, for no children would be born, he replies: 'That would be a
 blessing. It would mean that the number of the elect would be filled up, and the
 kingdom of God accomplished'--in the language of our Burial Service. This
 presumably alludes to the theory that the world need only go on until the number
 of elect required to fill up the vacancies caused by the falling of the angels
 had been made up. That was the object of the creation--to fill up the gaps in
 heaven. The rest do not matter. God would not keep the factory of the world
 running for the sake of the waste-products. You may fairly urge against S.
 Augustine the kind of reproaches that figure in the Pagan's Lament in
 Swinburne's poem:</p>
 <p>        'Thou hast conquered, O pale
 Galilean, and the world has<br>
             grown grey
 with Thy breath;<br>
         We have drunken of things Lethean,
 and fed on the kisses <br>
             of death.'</p>
 <p>But it is a different charge to make him 'the only begetter' of the Bull, <i>Unam
 sanctam.</i></p>
 
 <p>That is not to deny that there are weighty considerations in favour of such a
 view. Were there not, we could never have such strong words as those of
 Kattenbusch, who speaks of him as the Father of the Papacy. Geirke holds that
 the logical development of the Augustinian doctrine involves the complete
 subjection of the State to the Church.[<a name="text09" href="#foot09">9</a>]
 Similar are the views of Dorner, Schmidt, Eicken and many more.[<a name="text10" href="#foot10">10</a>]
 Their views are stronger evidence of what Augustine meant, than is the constant
 use that was made of him by mediæval thinkers. The mediæval habit of taking
 tags as text-proofs, apart from the general purpose of the writer, discounts
 their value as evidence. Besides this there was an immediate polemical interest
 at stake.</p>
 <p>For this purpose we must go further. The 'De Civitate Dei' needs for its
 interpretation the writings against the Donatists. In that conflict Augustine
 was led to accept the assistance of the civil power. So far as I can make out,
 he was never very happy about this proceeding, and felt that it needed apology.
 Partly, this feeling was due to the fact that his action indicated a definite
 change of mind. In early days, and in regard to the controversy with the
 Manichæans, Augustine had forgone all such things, and argued in favour of
 freedom of opinion. This was a change, and one which he had to explain. So far
 as the Donatists were concerned, he had an easy task. From them indeed any
 objection to the employment of force was little short of an impertinence. They
 had themselves appealed to the civil power. Only when the appeal was rejected
 had they turned round and cried 'hands off' to the State. Besides the violence
 of the Circumcellions, if not precisely authorised, was largely used by them.
 Much of what was done on the side of the Church was only an attempt often
 ineffectual, to secure that the peace should be kept. This attempt had been
 largely frustrated through the intimacy between Optatus and the Count Gildo.</p>
 <p>Augustine did not confine his defence to these limits. He produced a definite
 argument in favour of force in religious matters. Most of it he bases on the
 verse 'Compel them to come in.' He does not want opinion forced. He thinks that
 penalty is useful, because it makes a man reflect, and often give up his view as
 erroneous. It is, in fact, educational, and, in his view, precisely similar to
 the use of the rod. It is persecution for the soul's good. Augustine's
 conception of the office of the State is largely that of an educator.</p>
 <p>Out of this acceptance of persecution it is easy to develop a theory of civil
 domination. The State is to use force. That is its duty. It is to extend the
 province of the Kingdom of God on earth. Remember, it is not, as it was later
 on, conceived as being the 'secular arm' of the Church. If the civil Governor is
 to persecute heresy, who is to advise him? He cannot do so on his own motion.
 Obviously, the Church, organised through its governors, will advise him. The
 moment you accept persecution as a policy, you tend to a religious tyranny. The
 State may still be conceived as having self-identity of its own--as it was in
 the Presbyterian doctrine of the two kingdoms. But if it be bound to take orders
 from the Church in regard to religious matters, it will not be long before there
 will be a claim to direct the State in regard to any policy that may have a
 religious, or a moral, or an ecclesiastical bearing. How much will be left out?</p>
 <p>Add to this the inferences that may be drawn from justice (as Augustine
 defines it) as being needful to a perfect commonwealth. If the only true
 commonwealth be that in which Christ is King, and if that is to mean that the
 worship of God in Christ is not merely to be allowed, but to be enjoined by law,
 then you must have a theocratic State. It depends merely on what form of
 organisation the Church has, as to who shall have the last word. In a democratic
 system you might have the whole body of the faithful. In a hierarchical Church
 you might have either a General Assembly as in Scotland, or a General Council of
 bishops--or the Pope. As we saw last time, that notion of justice is not at all
 S. Augustine's own doctrine of the State. But it was sufficiently near it for
 men to take it apart from the rest; and, together with other indications, to
 make it serve the ends of the clericalism of the later Middle Ages.</p>
 <p>Even more is this true with regard to the conception of the Church as the
 apocalyptic kingdom. If the Church be, here and now, in enjoyment of its
 millennial glory, then the largest terms of supremacy that can be brought out of
 the Apocalypse may be interpreted literally. Its earthly head will be King of
 Kings and Lord of Lords.</p>
 <p>All these elements together--(<i>a</i>)<i> </i>the doctrine of a religion
 using the force of a <i>compelle intrare, </i>which must give to the Church some
 claim to dictate what shall be persecuted as heresy; (<i>b</i>)<i> </i>the
 doctrine of justice as necessary to a State, together with S. Augustine's
 glosses, leading to a control of all law for spiritual ends; (<i>c</i>)<i> </i>the
 doctrine of the Church as a polity, as the millennial Kingdom of Christ,
 implying a reigning authority-- will tend to develop a state of mind which will
 picture the <i>Civitas Dei </i>as a christianised Church-State, from which
 unbelievers are excluded, and which would claim, directly or indirectly, the
 supreme power in that State for the leaders of the hierarchy. If we add to this
 the effects of the Church's long continuance in a concentration upon earthly
 activities, the development of vast administrative machinery, the fact that she
 became to the conquering barbarians the symbol and the source of all culture, we
 are well on our way to such a conception of church-power as was represented by
 Innocent III.</p>
