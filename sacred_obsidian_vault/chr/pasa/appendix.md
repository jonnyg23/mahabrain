 <h2 align="CENTER">APPENDIX</h2>
 <p>THE following passages from Vives may interest the reader: (II, 7.) 'Thus
 farre Lucian. We have rehearsed it in the words of Thomas Moore, whom to praise
 negligently, or as if one were otherwise imployed, were grossnes. His due
 commendations are sufficient to exceed great volumes. For what is he that can
 worthily lim forth his sharpness of wit, his depth of judgement, his excellence
 and variety of learning, his eloquence of phrase, his plausibility and integrity
 of manners, his judicious foresight, his exact execution, his gentle modesty and
 uprightness and his unmoved loyalty? Unlesse in one word he will say that they
 are all perfect, intirely absolute, and exact in all their full proportions?
 Unlesse he will call them (as they are indeed) the patterns and lusters, each of
 his kind? I speake much, and many that have not known Moore will wonder at me,
 but such as have, will know I speake but truth: so will such as shall either
 reade his workes or but heare or looke upon his actions: but another time shall
 be more fit to spred our sailes in this man's praises as in a spacious ocean,
 wherein we will take this full and prosperous wind and write both much in
 substance and much in value of his worthy honours, and that unto favourable
 readers.'</p>
 <p>(VIII, 4.) ' It is a great question in our schooles whether Logic be
 speculative or practike. A fond question truly I thinke, and fellow with most of
 our philosophicall theames of these times, where the dreams of practice and
 speculation do nought but dull young apprehensions. . . . But these Schoolemen
 neyther know how to speculate in nature nor action, nor how the life's actions
 are to be ordered.'</p>
 <p>(XI, 10.) ' Words, I thinke, adde little to religion, yet must we have a care
 to keep the old path and received doctrine of the Church; for, divinity being so
 farre above our reach, how can wee give it the proper explanation?</p>
 <p>All words are man's inventions for humane uses, and no man may refuse the old
 approved words to bring in new of his own invention; for whenas proprieties are
 not to bee found out by man's wit, those are the fittest to declare things by,
 that ancient use hath left us, and they that have recorded most part of our
 religion. This I say for that a sort of smattering rash fellowes impiously
 presume to cast the old formes of speech at their heeles, and to set up their
 owne masterships, being grossly ignorant both in the matters, and their bare
 formes, and will have it lawful for them at their fond likings to frame or
 fashion the phrases of the Fathers in matter of religion into what forme they
 list, like a nose of waxe.'</p>
 <p>(XVIII, 18.) 'To create is to make something of nothing ; this God onely can
 do; as all the Divines affirme: but then they dispute whether hee can
 communicate this power unto a creature. Saint Thomas hath much concerning this;
 and Scotus seekes to weaken his arguments to confirme his owne; and Occam is
 against both, and Petrus de Aliaco against him: thus each one screweth the
 celestiall power into what forme he please. How can manners be amended, how can
 truth be taught, how can contentions be appeased as long as there is this
 confused obstinate jangling, and this haling too and fro in matter of Divinity,
 according as each man stands affected.'</p>
 <p>(XIX, 21.) '<i>For we may not imagine man's, unjust decrees to be lawes; all
 men defining law to arise out of the fountaine of justice</i>.'<i> </i>(Cicero, <i>De
 Leg. </i>1.)</p>
 <i>
 </i><p>Vives: 'It was not the people's command (saith he) nor Prince's decrees
 nor Judge's sentences, but the very rule of nature that gave original unto law.
 And again . . . Thus Tully out of Plato, and thus the Stoikes held against
 Epicurus, who held that nature accounted nothing just, but feare did. Seneca, <i>Epist.
 </i>16. This holy law that lyeth recorded in every man's conscience, the
 civilians call right and reason. . . . So that Ulpian defineth law to be <i>ars
 aequi el boni</i>;<i> </i>an art of right and reason, making him only a lawyer
 that can skill of this right and reason: and such that, as Tully said of
 Sulpitius, referre all unto equity, and had rather end controversies than
 procure them, that peace might generally be kept amongst men, and each be at
 peace with himselfe, which is the chiefe joy of nature.'</p>
