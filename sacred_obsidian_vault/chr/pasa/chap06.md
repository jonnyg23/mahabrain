 <h2 align="CENTER">THE 'DE CIVITATE DEI' IN LATER DAYS</h2>
 <p>THE mediæval unity was the grandest attempt in human history to base the
 structure of institutions upon righteousness, political, social and economic, no
 less than religious. When this unity broke up, a new world--as Luther said--came
 into being. It might seem as though the ideals connected with the mediæval
 projection of the <i>Civitas Dei </i>were gone beyond recall. That is true only
 partially. The break up of the ancient order did destroy this idea for Europe as
 a whole. Take such works as the 'Utopia' of Sir Thomas More and the 'Il
 Principe' of Macchiavelli. We can see how men's dreams were changed no less than
 the facts. The Renaissance appeared to have put an end to all such hopes as
 those which animated S. Thomas.</p>
 <p>Macchiavelli's remorseless study of the facts of the inter-state scramble in
 Italy is more remarkable for what it leaves out than for what it puts in. The
 conception of natural law has vanished. The passion of nationality furnishes the
 one ideal. In the moving and pathetic eloquence of the last chapter he cries for
 a saviour, who shall do for distressed Italy what other saviours have done for
 their people.</p>
 <p>'If, as I said, in order to show the valour of Moses it was necessary for the
 people of Israel to be enslaved in Egypt; and, for the magnanimity of Cyrus to
 be seen, it was needful for the Persians to be oppressed by the Medes; and, to
 illustrate the excellence of Theseus, the Athenians had to be dispersed: so now,
 for the virtue of an Italian spirit to be seen, it was needful that Italy should
 be reduced to the state in which she now is, and to be more enslaved than were
 the Hebrews, more oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than the
 Athenians, without head, without order beaten, dispirited, lacerated, hunted,
 and in fact enduring every kind of ruin.'</p>
 <p>Nothing can be nobler than Macchiavelli's desire for a redeemer of his
 people. But of justice, whether in the internal government or in the external
 relations of a people, he took no thought. Everything is reason of state.</p>
 <p>Savonarola's ideal for Florence, to be a godfearing city with a true
 democracy, had been given a trial. It had failed. With this failure, so far as
 the Italian States were concerned, there disappeared all efforts at ideal
 politics, until in the nineteenth century Macchiavelli's ideals triumphed by
 Macchiavelli's own methods. Italy became united under the headship of Victor
 Emmanuel and the astute diplomacy of Cavour. There was a man after
 Macchiavelli's heart. He had his reward.</p>
 <p>In Europe as a whole the Reformation destroyed the last hopes of a united
 Christendom. The 'Balance of Power' became the guiding-star of statesmen. From
 the League of Cambrai to the Partition of Poland was a natural development. We
 too have seen it even go further. Acton said ' Calvin preached, and Bellarmin
 lectured, but Macchiavelli reigned.' Here, however, a faint shadow of the old
 ideal can be discerned in the ideas and principles which underlay modern
 International Law.</p>
 <p>In regard to both these developments it is possible to trace the influence,
 if not the direct ancestry of ideas, to S. Augustine.</p>
 <p>It has been thought that the second definition of a commonwealth in the ' De
 Civitate Dei,' that in which the ideas of justice and religion do not appear,
 may have had something to do with the development of the non-moral doctrine of
 the State. It is doubtful how far this can be proved. This much is clear.
 Augustine emphasised the aim of the terrene State as being earthly peace and no
 more. This limitation has much to do with the rapidly developing theory of the
 secular State. That was developed largely by the Jesuits, in order the better to
 exalt the Church, the <i>Respublica Christiana. </i>Jesuit writers and others on
 that side developed frankly a doctrine of the civil State as being purely
 secular and having no ends that were not material. It can have to do with higher
 ideals only in so far as it is directed to these ends by the supreme religious
 guide. That is the principle of Bellarmin developed frankly and without
 disguise. This is different from the principles of writers like Augustinus
 Triumphus at the end of the Middle Ages, or of Bozius in the sixteenth century.
 These definitely make the whole world a single State, of which the Pope as 'King
 of Kings and Lord of Lords' is head. Bellarmin's doctrine of the indirect power
 of the Papacy allows to the civil State a being and purpose of its own. On one
 side it is frankly secular. The State of the Jesuits, when once it threw off its
 ecclesiastical tutelage, would be more, not less, indifferent in matters of
 religion--more also than was the old pagan State.</p>
 <p>The distinction on which all this argument depends unfortunately comes
 through S. Augustine. We saw that he was not always thinking of politics. Yet it
 remains true that the whole conception of the State as <i>Civitas terrena </i>is
 precisely what enabled the Jesuits to set up their doctrine of the civil State.
 Since also it virtually coincided with the doctrine of pure politics, which
 emerged at the Renaissance, it helped to produce our general modern notions.</p>
 <p>On the other hand the influence of Augustine on the growth of International
 Law is certain. That he laid down principles which might prove fruitful, if they
 were needed, cannot be denied. The conception of a world of equal States living
 in harmony and exchanging mutual services we owe to his mind, expressed in the
 passage about a world consisting of small States We cannot say that the founders
 of International Law depended upon S. Augustine. In Albericus Gentilis, 'De Jure
 Belli,' there are no citations from the 'De Civitate Dei.' In the great work of
 Grotius, 'De Jure Belli et Pads,' Augustine is frequently cited. This need not
 mean much. Here and there important arguments are based on these quotations. Yet
 so many authorities are adduced that it is hard to attribute priority to any
 single one. The avowed doctrine of Grotius is Natural Law. Certainly that is in
 S. Augustine, but Grotius did not take it from him. Still the general
 conceptions which are to be found in the ' De Civitate Dei,' of the mitigation
 of warfare through Christianity, of the sense of a common bond between nations,
 the insistence upon justice, the bitter condemnation of a policy of mere
 conquest--all these were among the many influences that helped to keep alive
 some flickering brands of Christendom, implying something better than the 'law
 of the beasts.' I am not certain that we can say more. The great ideal of a
 world ruled by justice had gone. If, however, the nations, now definitely
 recognised as sovereign and independent, should ever come to concord, they might
 point to the passage of which I have so often spoken, as laying down the ideal
 of world-politics in a body of States independent but mutually concordant.</p>
 <p>So much for Christendom and the great State. When we come to reduce the
 scale, the story is different. In the narrower field of compact territorial
 sovereignty, governments were not necessarily irresponsive to the same ideals
 that we saw embodied in the Holy Roman Empire. Moreover, during the long period
 of the wars of religion until at least 1609, when the Dutch won their long
 truce, and in a less degree until 1648, when absolute differences of religion
 were guaranteed at the Peace of Westphalia, the idea of some sort of Christendom
 survived. The State, as conceived by the Renaissance, the embodiment of power
 and nothing but power, did not triumph finally, except later on in Prussia. That
 was prevented by the Reformation, with its emphasis on theocratic and scriptural
 ideas of government.</p>
 <p>In the first place, the concentrated territorialism of the new States in
 Germany made the unity of religion with them a feasible aim--a Lutheran could
 leave a Calvinist State and live elsewhere still under the same 'Kultur.' So
 much so that one elector could say that 'his subjects' consciences belonged to
 him.' What triumphed everywhere was Erastianism--the lay power in a Christian
 State ruling over the clerical. Luther did not desire a State religiously
 heterogeneous. He did not desire a State founded on power alone. Luther and
 Melanchthon desired to transfer to civic and family life all the consecration of
 aim associated heretofore with monastic devotion. Erastus himself declared that
 he was considering the case of a State in which one religion and one only was
 tolerated, and that the true one. The control of the inner life of the Church by
 a Parliament, which might be composed of 'Jews, Turks, infidels and heretics,'
 was the last thing that Erastus contemplated. What he desired was to take all
 coercive authority out of the hands of the clergy, and transfer it to the civil
 magistrate. Stubbs says of Henry VIII 'that he would be the Pope, the whole Pope
 and something more than the Pope,' referring to the jurisdiction. The movement
 was a layman's movement, not in itself anti-religious. Its ideal is 'the godly
 prince.' Its State is a commonwealth in which Christ is King, no whit less than
 was the mediæval theocracy. All through the period of the Reformation this
 ideal expresses itself.</p>
 <p>With this expression there grew a more explicit recognition of the
 Commonwealth and the Church as two aspects of the same society. This doctrine
 was not confined to men of any especial opinion. It is the doctrine of Luther
 and Musculus and of John Knox but also of Whitgift and Laud and the more extreme
 Gallican lawyers in France, but not of Bossuet. We in England have this doctrine
 enshrined for ever by the serene and gracious intelligence of Hooker. Nothing
 could be clearer than his statement:</p>
 <p>'When we oppose the Church, therefore, and the Commonwealth in a Christian
 society, we mean by the Commonwealth that society with relation unto all the
 public affairs thereof, only the matter of true religion excepted; by the Church
 the same society with only reference unto the matter of true religion, without
 any other affairs besides; when that society which is both a Church and a
 Commonwealth doth flourish in these things which belong to it as a Commonwealth,
 we then say the Commonwealth doth flourish; when in the things which concern it
 as a Church, the Church doth flourish; when in both, then the Church and the
 Commonwealth flourish together,' (Hooker, <i>Ecclesiastical Polity, </i>viii. 15
 ; <i>Works, </i>iii. 420.)</p>
 <p>The opposite doctrine of the two kingdoms, as found in Hooker's adversary,
 Thomas Cartwright, is greeted by Whitgift with surprise as a strange monstrous
 birth. This doctrine, that of Church and State as two distinct societies, was
 developed by Huguenots in France, by Independents like Robert Browne in his
 treatise 'Reformation without tarrying for any' (<i>any </i>meaning the civil
 magistrate), but above all by the second generation of Presbyterians. It might
 be alleged by the Presbyterians that their doctrine was more akin to S.
 Augustine than that of the Middle Ages. No more than S. Augustine did the
 Presbyterians leave the State free in the interests of religion, but demanded
 that the Prince should use force to direct men for their good. The famous words
 of</p>
 <p>Andrew Melville to James I in 1606 are a classical expression of it.</p>
 <p>It was, however, the earlier doctrine that long ruled-- the conception of
 the State as in sort a Church--inside a compact unitary State. The argument for
 unity which in the Middle Ages had been employed partly on behalf of the
 Emperor, but more effectively on that of the Pope, could now be made the ground
 for treating the civil power as 'over all persons and in all causes supreme.'
 This principle of religious unity as a foundation of the Commonwealth and the
 only possible source of justice, was proclaimed by people of widely different
 opinions. In France we have the <i>une loi, un roi, une foi </i>of pamphleteers
 like Louis d'Orléans. This cry produced the 'conversion' of Henri Quatre, and
 ultimately the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, parallel with the assertion of
 extreme royalism in the Gallican Articles of 1682 and the threat to break off
 from Rome. On the other side we have Erastus proclaiming that there could be no
 coercive authority in the spiritual power, hinting that if necessary the prince
 could teach and administer the sacraments, developing into the doctrine of 'the
 Lord's Anointed' as a <i>persona mixta, </i>partly lay, partly ecclesiastical. A
 little later we see it expressed in the absolutism of Hobbes; and symbolised on
 his famous frontispiece. On the largest scale we see Hooker applying it to a
 nation-state. But it is not confined to that. Anabaptists are often treated as
 mere anarchists. That is only one side of them. The constructive governing side
 was shown in the attempt to secure a State inspired in every detail by Christian
 principles. Knipperdolling, the King, as he was called, of Münster, put this
 into practice. It is adumbrated in the 'Restitution' of Rothmann, who argues
 against the Chiliasts and in favour of a Kingdom of Christ on earth now, thus
 recalling S. Augustine.</p>
 <p>Calvin at Geneva and the Puritan polities illustrate the same principle. The
 reign of the saints, so called, was but the counterpart, on the narrower scale,
 of the doctrine of the rule of Christ in a truly just republic-- of that rule
 which the Canonists and Ultramontanes gave to the Pope.</p>
 <p>Let us take a literary expression of this. 'Nova Solyma,' which appeared in
 1648, is an attempt to imagine the city of God upon earth, 'to build Jerusalem,'
 as the name implies. It is a work of amazing interest both for its educational
 and political ideals. Despite much that was irritating in his manner, Mr. Begley,
 who published a translation in 1902, has done service in recalling this didactic
 romance from limbo. Let me quote from an article in the <i>Church Quarterly </i>which
 I wrote on the topic in the following year.</p>
 <p>'Puritanism, like nearly all ascetic ideals, had in it a strong Manichean
 bias. We know it chiefly by its enmities. It was active for destruction. It
 destroyed the monarchy, the aristocracy, and finally the representative system.
 It abolished the drama, it proscribed the Liturgy, it persecuted the bishops, it
 knocked down statues, overturned altars and shattered windows. It first
 abolished tyranny and then destroyed liberty and finally completed its career of
 devastation by giving the <i>coup de grâce </i>to itself. Few movements have
 been to all appearances more uniform in their destructive tendencies than was
 English political Puritanism. But it is no more right to judge Puritanism by its
 antipathies than it is Christianity. . . . It is the constructive side of
 Puritanism that "Nova Solyma" expresses. . . .</p>
 <p>'Puritanism at its best was constructive. Starting from the conception, made
 familiar to us all by Mr. James, of the twice-born soul, it desired to see a new
 "city of God" upon earth, in which, with whatever latitude for
 political and natural differences, the life of the Christian should be properly
 trained and guarded by a State directed by religious principles and acting
 solely from the highest aims. . . .</p>
 <p>'This ideal of a Christian State in accordance with Puritan principles is the
 whole purpose of "Nova Solyma." . . . It is the XVIIth Century <i>Civitas
 Dei, </i>as indeed its name implies. . . . Though Puritanism as a
 politico-religious party was not long in the ascendant, many of its governing
 ideas found their way into the more serious-minded of all classes, and have had
 a profound effect upon the national character. These or some of them will be
 found in "Nova Solyma," where we can learn that the Puritan was no
 Little Englander, no mere ascetic, no opponent of war, or hunting, or reading as
 such; but that his ideal was a State governed on principles of righteousness,
 training its members--body, mind, and spirit--in all the faculties and
 sentiments which may minister to the efficiency and energy appropriate to the
 conduct of a Christian member of an orderly and self-controlling society.
 Religion since the Reformation, said Sir A. F. Hort, has been departmental, and
 given up the aim of controlling the whole of human life in the way that
 mediæval Catholicism attempted. This is unfortunately to a certain extent true,
 but was not so always or in aim ; and such books as "Nova Solyma" are
 the proof of a broader ideal.' (<i>C.Q.R.</i>, lvii. No. 113, Oct. 1903,
 125-130.)</p>
 <p>That work is English. Take one which is not. Johann Valentin Andreae in 'Christianopolis'
 affords a similar illustration.[<a name="text01" href="#foot01">1</a>] Here,
 too, the main interest of the whole is in its ideals of education. But it is on
 a smaller scale and in every way inferior to ' Nova Solyma.' Both of them show
 how deeply men's imaginations were affected by the doctrine of an ideal
 Christian Commonwealth.</p>
 <p>Let us now take instances from men of opposite Political sympathies. The
 doctrine of the 'Divine Right of Kings,' on its religious as distinct from its
 legal and historical side, is an expression of the notion that the civil State
 ought to be a commonwealth of Christians, the <i>Civitas Dei. </i>It is this
 half-romantic, half-sacramental doctrine which consecrated to many the cause of
 the Stuarts. This religious side of the doctrine was as a rule stronger in
 England than in France.</p>
 <p>Yet Bossuet's 'Politique Tirée de l'Ecriture Sainte' is a good illustration
 of it. Bossuet prided himself on this dull work which looked towards the past,
 although it must be admitted that Bossuet never merged the Church in the State,
 but always regarded them as two societies. It is well to take this work as an
 illustration. With the beginning of the eighteenth century the end had come, so
 far as this country was concerned. The Nonjuring schism had considerable
 importance It developed strongly in the minds of men like William Law (in his
 letters to Hoadly) the doctrine of the Church, as a society in itself distinct
 from the State, though it might be composed of the same persons. Each body was,
 in the later phrase of Leo XIII, a <i>societas genere et jure perfecta. </i>The
 Bangorian controversy which was aroused by Hoadly's sermon 'The Kingdom of
 Christ,' showed the same notion in the religious sphere. Hoadly was dominated by
 the ancient notion which made the Church co-extensive with the nation; and
 therefore desired the comprehension within it of anybody and everybody. Sherlock
 and his other opponents asserted the distinctness and historic independence of
 the Church, and the incompetence of the civil power to control it. This tendency
 had been increased by other causes. The Toleration Act and the Union with
 Scotland destroyed the notion of a uniform religious State. True it left some
 basis, for the Toleration Act stopped short of Unitarianism or the Papacy, and
 the Scots refused to tolerate episcopacy. But now the Kingdom, united as never
 before, was not even professedly uniform in religion. It boasted two different
 established churches. Naturally, this led to a resuscitation, even among
 establishment Divines, of the doctrine of the two Societies.</p>
 <p>Warburton's 'Alliance between Church and State' is a better book than many
 people think. It lays down that the two bodies are entirely distinct in nature,
 though they may be composed of the same individuals. But the State establishes a
 Church from a utilitarian, not from a religious motive. It is not the business
 of the State to seek the truth, but merely to take the religion of the majority
 of its members and establish that. As the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries
 proceeded, the old Augustinian doctrine of a Christian Church-State prevailing
 in the Middle Ages, and through the Reformation, gradually disappeared.
 Toleration gave way to complete civil rights for Dissenters, Roman Catholics,
 Jews, and finally Atheists. It has been recently decided in the Courts that a
 bequest to a Free Thinking Association was legal. Religious heterogeneity is
 recognised as a principle of the modern State. In Mr. Gladstone's early book, '
 The State in its Relations with the Church,' we find a last echo of the old
 view. But he does not contemplate, like Hooker, a single society. Rather, he
 treats the Church as the conscience of the State, and deprecates on that ground
 the admission of the Jews to full political rights.</p>
 <p>The notion of a theocracy has more and more receded from discussions on
 general politics. The notion of the principles of Christian ethics--<i>i.e. </i>the
 golden rule, which is held by many non-Christians on different grounds --as the
 governing doctrine of political and social justice, has tended to increase in
 importance. Not merely Christian socialism, but many more general doctrines of
 humanity, are content to argue that (in this sense) the world is or ought to be
 Christian, and its legislation ought to be framed according to the
 Jewish-Christian rule of fraternity. This tendency has been enhanced by the war.
 Many who before regarded Christianity as an effete system of impossible dogmas
 awakened to find that the real difference between the belligerents was nothing
 less than the prevalence of certain ethical ideals, of which the most eminent if
 not the only expression was the Christian system. Reconstruction,</p>
 <p>it is alleged, in order to be stable, must follow these lines--whether
 applied to Europe as a whole in the relations between States, or to the domestic
 economy of peoples, or to the relations of classes. As the doctrine of absolute
 state-sovereignty is criticised, so also is the companion doctrine of absolute
 rights in private property. Neither of these criticisms is new, even in modern
 times. Both have been rendered more acute by the war, <i>i.e. </i>the ideal of a
 State is more and more seen to be dependent on justice.</p>
 <p>Only, as S. Augustine failed to see, justice in politics and in social
 economy has reference only to those ideals of <i>cuique suum tribuere </i>and
 the Golden Rule, which are not necessarily in fact bound up with religion. Men
 can unite in those, who yet differ <i>in toto </i>on the theological foundation.
 In this sense indeed it may be natural to look forward to a Christian State; but
 certainly it is neither natural nor wise to do so in the sense of a State which
 promulgates the Christian religion and none other. Consequently, while
 legislation or custom may well be pressed on the ground of its accordance with
 Christian principles, so far as they are confined to the social doctrine, it is
 impolitic and even wrong to condemn or promote legislation on the ground that it
 conflicts with the law of the Christian Church. That is to attempt to make what
 is true only of one society govern the whole.</p>
 <p>To sum up, with the Renaissance the secular or pagan State tended to become
 the ideal. This effect was counteracted by the Reformation. Yet that destroyed
 the ancient unity of Western Christendom and made impossible the ideal of the
 Holy Roman Empire, of a single Catholic Commonwealth of princes and lords and
 peoples, a unity of all culture. Vestiges of this lingered on and helped towards
 the beginning of modern International Law. On the smaller scale of the separate
 State, the effect of the Reformation was different. It tightened instead of
 loosening all those ties that made for a concentrated unitary State. So much so,
 that it is even now but slowly and with infinite reluctance that political
 problems can be discussed on any other basis. For the more part within that
 State it shifted the balance of power from the clergy to the laity, the Church
 to the State, the Pope to the King. If we recognise that change, we can say that
 the ideal of a uniform Christian commonwealth was as real to Hooker as it was to
 Alfred the Great. This was the aim of the great national States like England and
 France, of the smaller territorial sovereignties in Germany, with their maxim <i>cujus
 regio ejus religio, </i>and even of bodies like the Anabaptists and Pilgrim
 Fathers, as soon as they obtained rule. We see this expressed on the grand scale
 by Hooker and Whitgift, on the smaller scale by Rothmann and 'Nova Solyma.' In
 some of the arguments adduced in favour of established churches, and in certain
 vague appeals to Christian principles, it can be discerned in our own days, and
 can be traced right back to S. Augustine. On the whole, however, religious
 heterogeneity is recognised as a fundamental part of the modern State, but in
 regard to certain fundamental ethical principles of neighbourliness, mutual love
 and so forth, Christian morals (as apart from any kind of theology) are
 increasingly recognised as integral to a just and even to a stable organisation
 of life.</p>
 <p>On the other hand, the development of the secular, this-worldly theory of the
 State, whether by Jesuits or Presbyterians in their own interest, owes much to
 the other and more commonly neglected side of S. Augustine--that in which he
 openly discarded the principles of religion in the idea of a commonwealth. The
 sharp distinction between secular and sacred, holy and profane, which ruled
 historical writing until recently, though not introduced, was enormously
 strengthened by S. Augustine.</p>
 <p>The problem which S. Augustine discussed in this book is fundamental, nor has
 it ever been finally resolved. It is a conflict not primarily between two
 polities. To make it that, is to externalise it and to make it relatively
 superficial, deep down in history though even that goes. Rather the conflict is
 one between two religions<i>-- </i>Christianity and Paganism. That is S.
 Augustine's primary and predominating thought. It never leaves him. These two
 religions are conceived as the binding force of two societies, the expression of
 two opposing passions: <i>Fecerunt itaque civitates duas amores duo-- </i>the
 passion for God and the passion for self. That is the direction alike of angelic
 and human wills, which makes the whole time-process since the fall of Lucifer a
 drama of eternal tragedy, and conditions the Redemption. If we seek to
 understand S. Augustine mainly by the outcome to which his system led in
 history, we shall do wrong. Rather we must seek to understand that by the deeper
 antagonism--between the other-worldly and the this-worldly reference of all
 institutions. This we shall realise better by a more intimate personal knowledge
 of the most intimate and personal of all divines until John Henry Newman. In
 Augustine there were struggling two men, like Esau and Jacob in the womb of
 Rebecca. There was Augustine of Thagaste, of Madaura, of Carthage, of Rome, of
 Milan, the brilliant boy, the splendid and expansive youthful leader, 'skilled
 in all the wisdom of the Egyptians,' possessed of the antique culture,
 rhetorical, dialectic, Roman-- the man of the world, the developed humanist
 with enough tincture of Platonism to gild the humanism; and there is the
 Augustine of the 'Confessions,' of the 'Sermons,' of the 'De Civitate,' the
 monk, the ascetic, the other-worldly preacher, the biblical expositor, the
 mortified priest. These two beings struggle for ever within him, the natural man
 filled with the sense of beauty and the joy of living, expansive, passionate,
 artful--and the supernatural Christian fleeing from the world, shunning it,
 burning what he adored, and adoring what he burnt, celibate and (at times)
 almost anti-social.</p>
 <p>This book itself is too great to be consistent. We can see in it traces of
 this ceaseless conflict. The otherworldly aim is predominant, the annihilation
 of all earthly values in comparison with the <i>summum bonum.</i></p>
 
 <p>But evidences, we have noted, remain of the humane, social, cultured ideal.
 The conflict is eternal in human life. No change of religion will put a term to
 it. Not even as some think, as I suppose Augustine thought, the abolition of all
 eternal values. On the one hand is the world, the present, the course of life,
 the immediate 'nice things'; and on the other the Eternal, the far-off, the
 spiritual city, the altar of sacrifice, the chalice of suffering--each calls
 us, each finds response in our nature. How can this problem be resolved? One way
 is by complete world-flight, the extreme of asceticism, <i>i.e. </i>asceticism
 not as discipline but as self-annihilation, or, as seen in the sphere of
 institutions, in the utter subjection of the city of this world to the rule of
 those who speak in the name of the Eternal. On the other is the pagan solution,
 frankly materialistic, developing on its better side a grand picture of human
 society, and a high development of all human arts, but ruling out as irrelevant
 all interests that look beyond. Neither by itself can satisfy.</p>
 <p>The real change in S. Augustine took place when he was converted to Platonism
 by reading Cicero's 'Hortensius' and not in the later well-known scene in the
 garden at Milan. From that first moment related in the 'Confessions' he had the
 nostalgia of the infinite, and all earthly goods were annihilated to his
 restless spirit. The charge brought by Nietzsche against Plato that he did the
 real damage, preparatory to Christianity, by setting up the doctrine of another
 world is true.</p>
 <p>Perhaps it is this which makes Augustine's apologetic more impressive on the
 general theistic, than it is on its distinctively Christian, side.</p>
 <p>Yet that fact suggests the solution. Plato, and still more the
 Neo-Platonists, showed that a mere humanistic culture is bankrupt at the last,
 for man's heart is restless until he find God. Even humanism as an ideal cannot
 be carried out without an infusion of the otherworldly principle--present
 pleasure must be given up for future bliss even by an Alexander.</p>
 <p>Augustine calls attention to this. The Romans, he said, were moved by earthly
 motives of ambition, no more. To that end they were prodigal of sacrifice.
 Christians for their end, which is so much higher, would do well if they were to
 learn the devotion to the heavenly <i>patria </i>which the Romans gave to an
 earthly one. In other words, the Roman State, the earthly aim, could not be
 maintained except by sacrifice. True, the sacrifice is for an end of this world
 alone. Yet it is equally sacrifice of the immediate for a far-off end, for an
 individual and even for a community like Saguntum it means the surrender of life
 itself for the good of the whole. What makes this possible?</p>
 <p>Even earthly ambitions apart from the State, even sheer individualism, can
 make no progress without sacrifice and what Christians call the Cross. Any
 successful merchant knows that. Even the hardest voluptuary must postpone
 immediate goods--in the Christian phrase, must die to live--and take risks, or
 he will not fulfil the demands of his passions.</p>
 <p>Thus then the edifce of humane culture cannot but rest its foundations on the
 principle of the Cross, and also upon social and communal interdependence. ' Man
 cannot live for himself alone.' Yet this principle has in many cases no meaning
 and no appeal to the individual, if there be no world beyond.</p>
 <p>Take the other side. Sheer world-flight is not possible. The extremest
 ascetic--S. Simon on his pillar--must be fed. In the 'De Opere Monachorum S.
 Augustine points this out.[<a name="text02" href="#foot02">2</a>] It is all very
 well, he says, for people to say that a man ought to be entirely occupied with
 the things of God, and therefore need do no labour. This cannot be. The dinner
 must be cooked. Some manual work is a necessity in any self-sufficing society.
 Therefore it cannot be contrary to true monastic life to do some secular work.</p>
 <p>Besides, whether for the selfish end which we considered above, or for the
 religious, sheer individualism would be the final abutment of either,
 world-flight or world-acceptance, taken by itself. Sheer individualism is
 literally unthinkable. A selfish man of culture needs the help of society at
 every turn. A world-renouncing monk cannot do without security. Social and
 communal activities are of the essence of human life, for no one can dispense
 with them. If they are, then sacrifice of what we want, even, on occasion, of
 life itself, becomes a necessity at times, a fact of which to-day we have lurid
 evidence. Nor in the long run can such sacrifice be justified to the individual
 apart from an other-worldly aim. The goods of human sacrifice are real goods.
 But just as the individual is driven to the larger life of the community by the
 natural fact of the family, so human society and all human culture is possible
 only by the ultimate recognition of the eternal goal. Otherwise there will come
 the decadence, such as overcame Greece and Rome and the Renaissance. That is the
 lesson of the 'De Civitate Dei.' Our ideals of beauty must be rooted in the hope
 of eternal life--earthly glories are symbols and sacraments--if they be not
 evil; for 'God created man to be immortal and made him an image of his own
 eternity,' or in his own words: 'Thou hast made us for thyself, and our heart is

 <p>'Quid enim agant qui operari corporaliter nolunt, cui rei vacent scire
 desidero. Orationibus inquiunt et psalmis et lectioni et verbo dei. Sancta plane
 vita, et Christi suauitate laudabilis. Sed si ab his auocandi non sumus, nee
 manducandum est, nee ipsae escae quotidie praeparandae ut possint apponi et
 adsumi. Si autem ad ista vacare seruos dei certis interuallis temporum ipsius
 infirmitatis necessitas cogit, cur non et apostolicis praeceptis obseruandis
 aliquas partes temporum deputamus?</p>
