 <h2 align="CENTER">THE LITERATURE OF THE 'DE CIVITATE DEI'</h2>
 <p>BERNHARD DOMBART has an interesting posthumous paper on the text. It is
 printed in Harnack &amp; Gebhardt's 'Texte und Untersuchungen,' 1908, with the
 title: 'Zur Textgeschichte der Civitas Dei.' (Dombart having died before the
 publication, it was produced by Otto Stählin.)</p>
 <p>The first printed edition appeared at Subiaco in 1467. Mentelin produced an
 important edition at Strasburg about the year following, which included the
 earliest commentary--that of Thomas Valois and Nicholas Triveth. This
 commentary is full in the earlier parts but meagre later. In 1522 J. L. Vives
 published the first edition which was made from a collation of the MSS., with a
 commentary of his own in which he attacked violently all the scholastic
 commentators. He makes many annotations. Some of them are amusing. We have
 interesting portraits of scholars like Sir Thomas More and Budé (Budæus),
 shrewd gibes that relieve a mass of detail, quips at scholastics, along with a
 defence of traditional religion against the unquiet spirit of Luther. With the
 comments of Vives are sometimes printed those of Leonard Coquæus (1661).</p>
 <p>Of modern editions of the 'De Civitate Dei,' the best is that in the Vienna '
 Corpus Scriptorum by E. Hoffmann. A smaller and later one, also in two volumes,
 by Dombart is useful. It lacks that elaborate table of contents which closes
 certain less important editions.</p>
 <p>This table is not authoritative, but it is useful. Scholz gives an account of
 its origin.</p>
 <p>In the late sixteenth century J. Healey made a fine translation. The folio
 edition of it issued in 1610 and 1620 gives also Vives' commentary. This
 translation (less the commentary) was recently reprinted in the 'Ancient and
 Modern Theological Library.' What purports to be the same appeared subsequently
 in three volumes in the Temple Classics. At the end of Vol. III we are told that
 Dr. Bussell, its editor, has rearranged and abridged it. He has done this
 without telling the reader where the cuts are made. Consequently all the
 references are useless except at the beginning, <i>e.g. </i>it has been
 compressed into eighteen books instead of twenty-two. It is difficult to know
 where we are, although the wording of the translation has not been changed.
 Another modern translation is that by Dr. Marcus Dods in the ' Library of the
 Fathers'--also there is one by Dr. Gee (London, 1894).</p>
 <p>Literature on the 'De Civitate Dei' is large. Heinrich Scholz's 'Glaube und
 Unglaube in der Welt-geschichte' (Leipzig, 1911) is indispensable and everywhere
 interesting. It takes account of Reuter's view, but is independent. Bruno
 Seidel's thesis, ' Die Lehre des heiligen Augustinus vom Staate' is the most
 helpful single book. It is printed in Sdralek's 'Kirchen-geschichtliche
 Abhandlungen,' ix. 1 (1909). Hermann Reuter's 'Augustinische Studien' (Gotha,
 1887) is illuminating; but his anti-hierarchical bias must be borne in mind. The
 third essay, that on the Church as the Kingdom of God, is the most important for
 the understanding of the ' De Civitate Dei.' But no part of it can be ignored.</p>
 <p>Dorner's large book on Augustine ('Augustinus,' Berlin, 1873) has about one
 hundred pages bearing on the topics discussed here. It is important as it takes
 the view, followed by Ritschl and others, which makes Augustine the father of
 the Papacy.</p>
 <p>Ritschl's Essay, 'Ueber die Methode der älteren Dogmengeschichte,' which
 appeared in the <i>Jahrbücher für Deutsche Theologie, </i>Bd. XVI, 191-214 (Gotha,
 1871), is reprinted in the first volume of his 'Gesammelte Aufsätze,' pp.
 147-169. It contains certain important statements about Augustine, which I have
 discussed. So also does the great work of Otto Gierke,' Das deutsche
 Genossenschaftsrecht.' These maximise the clericalist side (in order to condemn
 it). The same is true of H. von Eicken in his book, 'Geschichte und System der
 mittelalterlichen Weltanschauung' (Stuttgart, 1887). Hertling severely, but not
 unfairly, attacked this in his 'Beiträge zur Philosophic.' Important essays on
 the subjects here discussed are hidden away in journals, <i>e.g. </i>Reuter
 laments the common ignorance of H. Schmidt's essays. They are published in the <i>Jahrbücher
 für Deutsche Theologie. </i>Vol. vi. pp. 197-255 (1861) contains that on 'Des
 Augustinus Lehre von der Kirche,' vols. vii. 237-281 and viii. 261-325 that on
 Origen and Augustine as apologists. Those are important. Ferdinand Kattenbusch
 is said to be the first to call attention to Augustine's identification of the
 Church with the apocalyptic kingdom. His 'Kritische Studien zur Symbolik' (the
 second essay) will be found in ' Theologische Studien und Kritiken' (Gotha,
 1878). Feuerlein, who takes Augustine as a typical mediæval, wrote his essay, 'Ueber
 die Stellung Augustins in der Kirchen- und Culturgeschichte,' in Sybel's '
 Historische Zeitschrift,' 1869, vol. xxii. 270. It is not otherwise valuable.</p>
 <p>Edmond Boissier's 'Fin du Paganisme' has a good many pages bearing on this
 topic. So also an interesting thesis from Columbia University by E. Humphreys,
 'Politics and Religion in the Days of Augustine.' On the philosophy of history
 there is Reinkens' rectorial address at Breslau (1865), to which I alluded in my
 second lecture. He was afterwards an Old Catholic bishop. This essay has been
 over-praised. Others are those of G. S. Seyrich, 'Die Geschichtsphilosophie
 Augustins nach seiner Schrift de Civitate Dei' (1891), and A. Niemann, 'Augustins
 Geschichtsphilosophie' (1895).</p>
 <p>Two books that are indispensable are Joseph Mausbach's 'Die Ethik des
 heiligen Augustinus,' two volumes (Freiburg, 1909), and Ernest Troeltsch, '
 Augustin, die christliche Antike und die Mittelalter' (1915). The latter is
 written in strong reaction against the view of Augustine as essentially
 mediæval. Mausbach writes an apologetic of S. Augustine against all who, like
 Ritschl, make him hostile to the State and to culture.</p>
 <p>An American, Dr. Anson, wrote on the sources of the first ten books, and Dr.
 Frick has discussed those of the eighteenth.</p>
 <p>A good account will be found in Dr. Cunningham's Hulsean Lectures (1885), 'S.
 Austin and his Place in the History of Christian Thought.' Dr. Carlyle in his
 'History of Political Theories in the West' says surprisingly little. Professor
 Dunning says even less in his 'History of Political Thought.' There is an
 unsympathetic dissertation from Geneva by F. Thomas, 'S. Augustin, La Cité de
 Dieu' (1886). Harnack in the 'History of Dogma ' says some important things on
 the same lines as Ritschl and Gierke. Beard has some pages in his book on the
 Reformation. The former German Chancellor, Count Georg von Hertling, has a book
 on Augustine ('Der Untergang der antiken Kultur, Augustin,' 1902) in the series
 'Weltgeschichte in Karakterbilden'; the pp. 98 and <i>sqq. </i>treat of the 'De
 Civitate Dei.' He declares this to be the most potent in influence of all S.
 Augustine's works. Hertling takes the view which I have taken in Lectures III
 and IV, and refuses to identify the two cities <i>sans phrase </i>with Church
 and State. Roundly he declares that of any hostility to the State on the part of
 the Church, Augustine knew nothing. A large book on Augustine ('Augustinus,'
 Paderborn, 1898) by Cardinal Rauscher, and published after his death, may be
 mentioned. Theo Sommerlad's two works, 'Das Wirtschaftsprogramm der Kirche des
 Mittelalters' (Leipzig, 1903) and 'Die wirtschaftliche Thätigkeit der Kirche in
 Deutschland' (Leipzig, 1910), carry to the farthest point the notion of
 Augustine as the author of a system of gigantic social reform. Robert-son's
 'Regnum Dei' may also be consulted. Much use therein is made of Reuter.</p>
