 <h2 align="CENTER">III</h2>
 <h2 align="CENTER">THE STATE</h2>
 <p>IN trying to comprehend S. Augustine's thought about the State, we must avoid
 one error, that of translating <i>Civitas </i>by State.[<a name="text01" href="#foot01">1</a>]
 His thought, as I said, is eminently social. He thinks of good and bad as
 gathered into two societies. Only at the last judgment will the <i>Civitas
 terrena </i>be dissolved into its constituent atoms. But <i>civitas </i>is not
 for Augustine a term convertible with <i>respublica </i>; and the <i>Civitas Dei
 </i>is to be found long before a visible Church existed, even before the call of
 Abraham. He speaks of the good and the evil as mystically two cities, stressing
 the word mystical. More than once he explains <i>civitas </i>as equivalent to
 society. The primary distinction is always between two societies, the body of
 the <i>reprobate </i>and the <i>communio sanctorum</i>; not between Church and
 State. With his strong doctrine of election, it is natural that he should follow
 Tyconius in his views of the <i>bipartite</i> nature of the body of God, <i>i.e.</i>
 The elect and the mererly nominal members. On earth these two bodies are
 intermingled, and always will be. Only partially and for certain purposes is the
 <i>Civitas terrena </i>represented by any earthly polity. The Church represents
 the <i>Civitas Dei </i>rather by symbol than by identification. This error is
 often made. Some phrases seem to point that way. But first of all the
 distinction is to be drawn as I have stated. Error has arisen by identifying <i>sans
 phrase </i>the <i>Civitas terrena </i>with the State as such; and by taking
 every predicate applied to the <i>Civitas Dei </i>as obviously intended for the
 Church Militant. It would be less inaccurate to represent it, in the familiar
 phrase, as the conflict between the Church and the World. Yet even this would
 not be right. The real divisison is one which will be made manifest at the Last
 Judgment, and not until then. All early distinctions are but the symbols, never
 adequate, of the final grouping into sheep and goats. Members of either body are
 found, and always will be found, in the terrene representative of the other. It
 is the superiority of other-worldly interests to those of this world which is
 the gist of all.</p>
 <p>Hermann Reuter[<a name="text02" href="#foot02">2</a>] goes on to remark that,
 even if we were using political terms to translate <i>civitas, </i>we ought to
 use the word 'city' rather than 'state.' That is true. Hardly is it of capital
 importance, since the antique conception of a commonwealth was derived from the
 city-state. I doubt if we gain much by saying that Cain was the founder of <i>a </i>city,
 not <i>the </i>State. What we have to try and grasp is what Augustine thought
 about the State; not what he thought about some States. Does he condemn the <i>Respublica?</i></p>
 
 <p>In his deduction of the two cities Augustine uses strong words on the effects
 of the lust of dominion. To Augustine it was, as to Nietzsche, 'the will to
 power' that is founded upon the direct opposite of neighbourly and Christian
 motives. Only he draws an opposite inference. The original relations of man to
 man are not without organisation. The family is primitve and divine, and an
 association of families is natural. The first kings were shepherds. Dominion, <i>i.e.
 </i>absolute despotic dominion in the sense of the Roman Law, the power of the <i>pater-familias,
 </i>of a master over slaves-- that, as applied to man instead of animals, is
 due to sin. Those people who quarrel with this have no right to say that slavery
 is wrong now. Slavery owed its beginning to sin. None the less is it God's
 judgment--as a punishment--and must be borne.</p>
 <p>In the earlier chapters of the Fourth Book Augustine decides on the whole
 against large Empires, though in one place he seems to admit that Rome acquired
 hers justly, on the ground of the iniquity of her enemies. But he takes the case
 of the first invader of the ancient hereditary monarchies, Ninus, as the
 classical instance of the foundation of an Empire obtained by force and fraud;
 and he decides that it is no better than a <i>grande latrocinium. </i>('De
 Civitate,' IV. 6.)</p>
 <p>'To war against one's neighbours and to proceed to the hurt of such as hurts
 not you, for greedy desire of rule and sovereignty, what is this but flat
 thievery, in a greater excess and quantity than ordinary?'</p>
 <p>A page or two before he relates a story of Alexander the Great and the
 pirate, which is of a similar tenor.</p>
 <p>Augustine's attitude in regard to slavery, and to private property in the
 sense of absolute dominion, is nothing new, although the lesson has not yet been
 learnt by the world. May it not be said that one of the things that men have
 been slowly learning is that rights of property are not absolute, and that they
 must give way to the public welfare? This sense of property, as of absolute <i>dominion,
 </i>has dominated modern Europe through the Roman Civil Law. Yet the other sense
 lies behind the Civil Law. It is the presupposition of Jurists like Ulpian and
 the Stoics. Their teaching pointed ultimately to the end of chattel slavery. It
 may point in the same direction in regard to extreme rights of private
 ownership. The moment you say that ownership is the creation of the law, you
 imply the power of revising it. The idea that something else, common ownership,
 is natural, and that legal division is conventional, runs throughout history.
 Augustine argues that the source of right must either be divine constitution or
 human. Since we hold our property by the law of the State, we must hold to the
 State's laws. He does not wish to upset them. This, he says, in reply to the
 Donatists, in a letter to Vincentius ('Epist.,' xciii. § 12):</p>
 <p>'Since every earthly possession can be rightly retained only on the ground
 either of Divine Right, according to which all things belong to the righteous,
 or of human right, which is in the jurisdiction of the Kings of the Earth, you
 are mistaken in calling those things yours which you do not possess as righteous
 persons, and which you have forfeited by the laws of earthly sovereigns.'</p>
 <p>According to Sommerlad,[<a name="text03" href="#foot03">3</a>] Augustine set
 out to develop a theory of Church and State; but what as a fact he did was to
 'lay down an industrial and economic programme for the Middle Ages.' I cannot
 think either of these statements to be well-grounded. The last thing that he set
 out to do was to give a theory of the relations of the Church and State. Most of
 the more important errors in the interpretation of the 'De Civitate' have their
 origin in this notion. With regard to the second point, in the 'De Opere
 Monachorum' he argues strongly for the need of manual labour in bodies of
 religious.[<a name="text04" href="#foot04">4</a>] He will not have it that study
 and reciting the Divine Office are enough. That dictum may have helped to
 determine the character of Western monasticism. It may have inspired the
 Benedictine ideal. In so far, it helped to create an important element in
 mediæval civilisation. But it is surely a wild imagination to suggest that
 Augustine anywhere laid down a programme on socialistic lines for the Middle
 Ages; that that programme was for some centuries adopted, and was discarded at
 the Renaissance with the rise of modern capitalism.[<a name="text05" href="#foot05">5</a>]</p>
 <p>On the first point, Augustine said a great deal which has a bearing on Church
 and State as polities, and on their relations. Most of what he said could be
 used in more ways than one. In this and the following lecture I shall try to
 disentangle what he meant himself, and then in the last two to see what later
 times have made of the 'Civitas Dei.'</p>
 <p>Once more let us recall the general aim of the book-- an apology for the
 Church. That purpose does not cease with Book X. We can see this by the analysis
 of the last twelve books, how right down to the end he lays preponderant stress
 on the evidence for the faith in history and miracle.</p>
 <p>Further, the Church which Augustine was defending was now in enjoyment not
 merely of peace, but of imperial patronage. The peace of the Church was a
 century old when he began the book. The era of Julian was over. The Council of
 Constantinople had achieved the victory of Catholicism in the Empire. Theodosius
 had stamped Christianity upon the legal system. Doubtless the penetration was
 not so deep as it became later in the work of Justinian. Still it was the one
 officially supported religion. Such was not the time for an intransigent history
 of the rights of the Church, or for a nullification of the State. The occasion
 itself of the book shows this. Augustine had to argue that the legal prohibition
 of sacrifice was not a calamity. Was it likely that at such a moment he would
 assert that the State was a thing in essence evil? Yet that he is accused of
 doing. Ritschl, who followed Dorner, asserts that Augustine regarded civil
 government as such as being the organisation of sin.[<a name="text06" href="#foot06">6</a>]
 Eicken, a very recent writer, says that with the peace of the Church, the Church
 showed itself more hostile to the State than in the days of persecution.[<a name="text07" href="#foot07">7</a>]
 The Council of Nicea with its golden throne for the Emperor (as yet unbaptised)
 is an odd phenomenon, if that be so. But since this doctrine is set out in all
 earnestness by some of the most learned and acute minds, it must be rigidly
 examined before we are to reject it.</p>
 <p>Can we then interpret the 'De Civitate Dei' as teaching that civil society is
 wrong in itself? Doubtless it teaches, as any Christian book would teach, that
 all earthly activities have their value only in the service of God. Human life,
 including the State, has no value save as a preparation. The 'heavenly home' is
 the goal. Few thoughtful Platonists wouls say less. If Augustine means no more
 than that earthly activities have a purely relative and provisional value, as
 compared with the enduring realities of the immortal life, we ought to beware of
 attributing to him any violently anti-political doctrine. The problem is no easy
 one. Augustine is too great to be always consistent. Still let us bear in mind
 this. Not only here but in his other works Augustine repeatedly quotes with
 approval the Apostolic injunctions about submission to the powers that be. He
 declares the Government of Nero to be God's ordinance, and goes out of his way
 to say so. He is emphatic on the duty of rendering to Caesar what belongs to
 him. He is always full of the glory of Rome, and is imbued with the value of
 social union and family life. Beyond all this he is opposed to the Donatists.</p>
 <p>Reuter is right when he says that we cannot arrive at Augustine's political
 views--they never amount to a theory--from reading or studying the 'De
 Civitate Dei' by itself.[<a name="text08" href="#foot08">8</a>] We must study
 the treatises written against the Donatists; also his letters and sermons and
 some of the minor works. Now it was the Donatists, not the Catholics, who
 adhered to the old Christian attitude of the days of persecution--that typified
 by the Apocalypse, in which is pictured a death struggle between the Imperial
 power and the Christian Church.[<a name="text09" href="#foot09">9</a>] Yet in
 the Apocalypse we note that it is the Emperor as an object of worship that is
 condemned--never the idea of State authority. Much of S. Augustine's energies
 were occupied in combating the Donatists. Rather reluctantly he came to the
 conclusion that it was right to employ against them the forces of the civil
 government. He had thought differently in the days of his controversy with the
 Manichæans. Now that this policy won success, he gave rather reluctantly his
 adhesion to the views of his episcopal colleagues. Was it likely that, writing
 just after this, Augustine should turn round and condemn the State and all its
 works? It was the Donatists who claimed entire freedom from civil obligations.
 They were, in modern phrase, 'absolutists.' To them the State is an institution
 so profane as to be practically diabolical. That was the cry which Augustine had
 to meet. We can see how he met it in his reply to Petilian (II. 92). Petilian
 asks, 'What have you to do with kings who have never shown anything but envy to
 Christianity?' Augustine replies at length. The most important passage is in <i>c</i>.<i>
 </i>210. In this he says that kings must serve God as kings:--for no man as a
 private individual could command that idols should be taken from the earth. But
 that when we take into consideration the social condition of the human race, we
 find that kings, in the very fact that they are kings, have a service which they
 can render to our Lord in a manner which is impossible for any who have not the
 power of kings. This is assuredly to admit the sacred office of a king as
 representative of the State.</p>
 <p>There is another letter (<i>Ad Marcellinum, </i>138, <i>c</i>.<i> </i>15),
 one written to meet the charge of the pagans that Christianity was a civic
 peril, which affords even stronger evidence. After denying that Christianity
 condemns wars of every kind, he goes on:</p>
 <p>'Let those who say that the doctrine of Christ is incompatible with the
 State's well-being, give us an army composed of soldiers such as the doctrine of
 Christ requires them to be; let them give us such subjects, such husbands and
 wives, such parents and children, such masters and servants, such kings, such
 judges--in fine, even such taxpayers and tax-gatherers--as the Christian
 religion has taught that men should be, and then let them dare to say that it is
 adverse to the State's well-being; yet rather let them no longer hesitate to
 confess that this doctrine, if it were obeyed, would be the salvation of every
 commonwealth.'</p>
 <p>He points out that some form of State is needful to the worst tyrant and that
 the State is a natural and therefore a Divine necessity.</p>
 <p>Still, there is evidence which tells the other way. First of all there is the
 main gist of the book--this is to depress the <i>Civitas terrena. </i>Of that
 there is no doubt; and if the <i>Civitas terrena </i>is to be identified with
 the civil State, as such, <i>cadit quaestio. </i>But the <i>Civitas terrena </i>is
 above all the society of the reprobate, a union largely unconscious and no less
 invisible than the invisible body of the elect. Only in so far as this society
 is represented by the State does it come in for condemnation. What is condemned
 is the World in Creighton's definition of it: 'human society organising itself
 apart from God.'</p>
 <p>Then there is to be taken into account the remarkable passage, or couple of
 passages, in which Augustine condemns Imperialism (III. 10 and IV. 3, 15). At
 the most, however, this view only condemns great Empires. It does not
 depreciate, it rather exalts, the Commonwealth. Augustine sees how greatly the
 lust of power goes to the making of most great Empires. Rome he thinks had
 justice on its side. He dislikes the tyranny of strong nations over weak. He
 hazards the conjecture that the world would be most happily governed if it
 consisted, not of a few great aggregations secured by wars of conquest, with
 their accompaniments of despotism and tyrannic rule, but of a society of small
 States living together in amity, not transgressing each other's limits, unbroken
 by jealousies. In other words, he favoured a League of Nations--a condition, as
 he put it, in which there should be as many States in the world as there are
 families in a city. Still it is an organised State that he wants. There must be
 a union of families to create the city, and a union of associated governments,
 only no imperial power. Here is doctrine, not only social, but eminently
 political.</p>
 <p>In another passage he contemplates a condition in which compulsion will not
 be needed. There will be no more necessity for it than in a well-governed
 family. It is always on the analogy of the family that he thinks. But this is
 not to do away with law and government. Against the view that law is the
 expression of force; and no more, he sets out his doctrine that law has its true
 origin in consent.</p>
 <p>On this point Vives makes a comment which is worth quoting (X. 4):</p>
 <p>'Oh, what a few laws might serve man's life, how small a thing might serve to
 rule not a true Christian, but a true man. Indeed he is no true man that knoweth
 not and worshippeth not Christ. What serveth all these Digests, Codes, Glosses,
 Counsels and Cautels? In how few words doth our great Master show every man his
 due course. Love then Him which is above as well as thou canst, and that which
 is next thee like thyself, which doing thou keepest all the lawes and hast them
 perfect, which others attain with such toil, and scarcely keep with so many
 invitations and terrors. Thou shalt then be greater than Plato or Pythagoras
 with all their travels and numbers, than Aristotle with all his quirks and
 syllogisms.'</p>
 <p>We may compare also a later passage of Vives on XIV. 28:</p>
 <p>'With how excellent a breviate hath he drawn the great discourses of a good
 commonweal, namely that the rulers thereof do not compel or command, but,
 standing aloft like sentinels, only give warnings and counsels; thence were
 Rome's old magistrates called consuls, and that the subjects do not refuse or
 resist, but obey with alacrity.'</p>
 <p>Most, however, turns on another argument-- Augustine's discussion of
 Cicero's definition of a State, given in the 'De Republica.' Cicero there makes
 Scipio define a republic as <i>res populi. Populus</i>,<i> </i>however, must be
 explained. The words must be cited: '<i>Populum autem non omnem coetum
 multitudinis sed coetum juris consensu et utilitatis communione sociatum esse
 determinat</i>'<i> </i>(II. 21). In discussing this he fixes on the word <i>juris
 </i>and so makes justice to be of the essence of a State. This leads on to the
 famous tag <i>remota justitia quid regna nisi magna latrocinia. </i>But
 Augustine does not allow himself to be balked by this. He argues that there is
 some kind of commonwealth even in a robber band.[<a name="text10" href="#foot10">10</a>]
 They are bound by the social contract among themselves. There must be rules for
 the division of the spoil. In other words, there must be within them a relative
 and internal justice, even though in regard to the world at large they are
 outlaws. In other words, any association, if permanent, must have within it the
 nature of a State or part of it. He points out that Rome according to the
 description of Sallust had ceased to be a republic owing to the growth of
 corruption in morals. This would be true of many other States. (This argument is
 somewhat akin to the notion of Locke, that a State ceases <i>ipso facto, </i>if
 the principles of the original contracts are violated.)</p>
 <p>Then later on (II. 21) he goes on to argue that if justice in the absolute
 sense be a <i>sine qua non </i>of a true commonwealth, then neither Rome nor any
 other pagan State was one. For you cannot have justice where the true God is not
 worshipped, and the only true commonwealth would be that wherein Christ is
 King.[<a name="text11" href="#foot11">11</a>] In XIX. 20 and 21 he says much the
 same. If this were all, it might be held to be decisive, <i>i.e. </i>to prove
 that Augustine condemns the State, though he does not really make the Church a
 State even here. Even here I do not see that there would be anything more than
 religious toleration required for the condition to be fulfilled, <i>i.e. </i>the
 position would be that of the Roman Empire after the peace of the Church in the
 time of Constantine. Perhaps, however, Augustine's doctrine assimilating the
 State to an individual might be held by implication to preclude toleration.</p>
 <p>Augustine does not stop here, although some of his interpreters, alike
 critics and disciples, have done so. He sees that either you must give the name
 State to Rome in all its changes, to the Greek republics and to the
 world-monarchies, or else you must find some other term that will enable you to
 classify them. Something must be wrong with Cicero's definition (or else with
 the Augustinian notion of justice) unless it can be applied to such societies as
 these. So he proceeds to give a definition of his own from which the word
 justice is excluded.[<a name="text12" href="#foot12">12</a>]</p>
 <p>'<i>Populus est coetus multitudinis rationalis, rerum quae diligit concordi
 communione sociatus</i>.'</p>
 <p>This, he says, will include Rome, Babylon, or any other settled State. The
 really governing word here is <i>concordi. </i>It is some kind of consent and
 harmony that is necessary.[<a name="text13" href="#foot13">13</a>] In an earlier
 passage he had adumbrated this, and said that this definition, as he would show,
 was <i>probabilior. </i>Augustine is like any modern who might argue, that the
 State, in the nature of things, is democratic, because democracy involves the
 recognition of human personality. That is a fact, which no legal system can make
 not to be a fact, merely by the process of denying it. You may lay down, for
 instance, that a slave is not a person, but a chattel, a thing. That does not
 make him one. He is a person. Your legal system is false to fact if it denies
 that. But the modern, who said that, would be unwise if he were to deny the name
 of State to governments which so acted. He could say if he liked that they were
 no true States. He could not say that they were not States. The moment you come
 to consider such a term as 'State,' you are tempted to put into its definition a
 description of its ideal form, so that a State comes to mean the perfect State.
 Thereupon, anything, that falls short of that, is outside the definition.
 According to Locke's definition, I believe that the English State must have
 disappeared with almost every parliament since 1832, because laws were passed
 interfering with the individualist basis. According to an opposite definition of
 sovereignty, that of Austin, it is at least plausible to say that there is no
 such thing, and never has been, as a true law in the United States of America.[<a href="#foot*" name="text*">*</a>]
 Augustine's use of Cicero's definition, and his enlargement of the notion of
 justice so as to include true religion, must be treated in the same way.</p>
 <p>That love to one's neighbour and to oneself (Augustine is no pure altruist),
 grounded on a love of God, are the greatest bonds of union among men must be the
 view of any Christian. So it is arguable that the Golden Rule is the foundation
 of political righteousness, and that the Golden Rule cannot be maintained apart
 from belief in God.</p>
 <p>Meanwhile the world is very evil. So long as the heathen in his blindness
 bows down to wood and stone we must have a number of communities that fall short
 of this ideal. They cannot be wholly without justice, or there would be no
 society at all, as Augustine most pertinently said even in regard to the robber
 bands. The good at which such societies aim--earthly peace and security--is a
 real good and no sham.[<a name="text14" href="#foot14">14</a>] It is not to be
 despised or disturbed, but is to be used by the <i>Civitas Dei. </i>So far is it
 from being true to say that Augustine destroys civil authority, that it would be
 fairer to say that he is like Luther. For Luther said, on the one hand, that
 civil government is due to the Fall, but (that being granted) it is a divine
 ordinance; and on the other, that earthly peace and security are of such high
 value that no amount of civil tyranny can justify insurrection. I doubt whether
 S. Augustine could have agreed with Origen that 'associations of men against
 unjust laws are to be approved, just as we all approve associations of men to
 execute a tyrant who sets himself against the liberties of a State.' He must
 have agreed with the first proposition in so far as it refers to Christians in a
 pagan State.[<a name="text15" href="#foot15">15</a>] But I question if he could
 have supported the second. So far indeed is Augustine from saying that injustice
 destroys the being of a commonwealth, that he uses the admitted injustice and
 corruption of Rome in the later days of the Republic as a <i>reductio ad
 absurdum </i>of Scipio's definition.</p>
 <p>Observe, once more, that Augustine declared that his definition of a State
 was more probable than that of Scipio. His sense of reality led him to prefer a
 definition which would include all existing and historical communities, and
 hamper him as little as possible by an abstract ideal.</p>
 <p>What is morally right for a nation to do is one thing. It is another thing to
 say, that if it fails to do it, then it ceases to be a nation. You can be human
 without being humane. The whole discussion is akin to that way of speaking which
 judges humanity, not by what it is, but by what it should be, in the developed
 notion of <i>humanitas. </i>It is not wise to say, even of our worst enemies,
 that they are not human--only that they act in a way that is a disgrace to the
 human race. The worst of men is a 'man for a' that.'</p>
 <p>Augustine's second definition goes back beyond Plato. It is paralleled by our
 modern distinction between law and (moral) right. What is not just is not law,
 said Algernon Sidney. This saying goes back through Bellarmine to S. Thomas, and
 through S. Thomas to S. Augustine--and further to Ulpian and the Stoics-- with
 the definition <i>jus est ars aequi et boni. </i>We do not now talk like
 Algernon Sidney. We prefer to say that laws may often be unjust, but that they
 are still laws We have been led to develop another plan, which is true to the
 facts of organised government, and therefore distinguishes law sharply from
 moral right. All of us are familiar with the notion that law is a universal
 command of the governing element in a community, although it may be oppressive,
 immoral and irreligious. Augustine did not go so far as this, but he realised
 the distinction which exists between a State permeated by justice, and a
 despotism or democracy which is still a State, though far removed from justice.
 He saw that State, reduced to its lowest terms, might be a people whose 'manners
 are none and their customs beastly'-- associated for bad ends, yet still a
 State, because keeping internal peace. Our distinction between legal and moral
 right can be derived out of this definition which allows to the community the
 full rights of a commonwealth, irrespective of its moral character.</p>
 <p>On what grounds the importance of this passage is denied I fail to
 understand. It was well enough for mediæval writers to take the other side only
 and argue from it. Professedly they were trying to conduct the State as a
 society of baptised persons. It is less comprehensible how writers in our modern
 world should try to tie S. Augustine down by his own severe interpretation of
 Scipio's definition, an interpretation which he develops only in order to pass
 to a different definition. So far is S. Augustine from giving a clericalist
 definition of the State, that he definitely discards it, and shows us that he
 does so with intention, and gives his grounds. It is contrary to the facts of
 life.[<a name="text16" href="#foot16">16</a>]</p>
 <p>Observe that we are discussing, not what S. Augustine ought to have meant, on
 a view of a certain section of his words, nor what those living in a different
 age might get out of his language, nor even what historically was the outcome of
 it, but simply what was the picture of the State that Augustine had in his own
 mind. The question is not what he has come to mean for others, but what he did
 mean himself.</p>
 <p>We must do what we have to do in regard to any thinker, viz. get behind his
 words and stated theories, and see what were the half-conscious presuppositions
 of his thought. Did Augustine represent to himself that civil society is a bad
 thing? Is it not truer to say that he regarded it as natural--although often
 perverted by evil wills? He is always arguing that every nature, even that of
 the devil, is good as nature, but that the will to use it aright has been
 changed by experience. The two societies, the terrene and the divine, are made
 by the two loves, the love of God and the love of self apart from God. With all
 actual States, the latter had much to do. Romulus, like Cain, killed his
 brother. Historically, wrongdoing has much to say in politics. Does anyone
 reading the newspapers deny this? In practice a State may have often been ruled
 by the 'law of the beasts' described by Machiavelli--but only partly is this
 so, or else the idea of justice could never have arisen. Nowhere, however, does
 he assert that human society is a bad thing. One of his most eloquent passages
 describes its value. Things being what they are, wars even may be just.
 Augustine is no pacifist. Wars are the result of the will to power, and are
 evil. Yet in the actual world they may be the less of two evils. Our Lord
 condemns not the act of defence but the animus of revenge. The earlier wars of
 Rome were, acts of defence as against criminal attacks. Her Empire was a reward
 of relative virtue. All governments are the will of God. Christianity, he
 claims, will mitigate even war. He looks to the development of moral limitation
 on war, under definitely Christian ideals. He quotes Cicero, and dilates (in the
 'Confessions,' iii. 8) upon the <i>generale pactum humanae societatis obedire
 regibus, </i>and is frequent in his references to the duty of obedience to civil
 governors as laid down by S. Paul and S. Peter. Nor does he interpret this in
 the hierarchical sense--a thing which was frequently done in the Middle Ages.</p>
 <p>How then is he to be treated as hostile to the State? Felix Dahn wrote that
 the doctrine of S. Augustine was logically false, morally diseased, politically
 corrupt and incompatible with duties to the State.[<a name="text17" href="#foot17">17</a>]
 Yet Augustine in his tractate <i>De Moribus Ecclesiae Catholicae, </i>I. xxx.,
 has a fine passage on the effects of the love of God and our neighbour in
 teaching every kind of civic duty:</p>
 <p>'Tu pueriliter pueros, fortiter juvenes, quiete senes, prout cujusque non
 corporis tantum, sed et animi aetas est, exerces ac doces. . . .</p>
 <p>'Tu cives civibus, gentes gentibus, et prorsus homines primorum parentum
 recordatione, non societate tantum, sed quadam etiam fraternitate conjungis.
 Doces reges prospicere populis, mones populos se subdere regibus.'</p>
 <p>He did not, as I said earlier, set out to produce a theory of the State.
 There is no discussion about the merits of the various forms of government,
 though there is the classical passage known as the 'Mirror of Princes'
 describing the attributes of a good king. The one purely political passage is
 that which I discussed earlier in the argument for a family of small States,
 living in amity, with its corollary the condemnation of imperialism.</p>
 <p>His strongest word is that passage (II. 21) in which he says, that, in the
 strictest view of justice, you could have only one real kingdom, that in which
 Christ is King. That, however, is little more than the sentiment of almost any
 Christian; that the best commonwealth would be composed of the people who
 accepted the best principles. It can hardly be said even to involve a
 hierarchical control. At any rate he says it, not in order to deny the rights of
 a commonwealth to other bodies--but to assert the need of a different
 classification. Still this passage would undoubtedly stimulate (as it did) the
 hierarchical interpretation of his doctrine. But it really illustrates the
 thesis of Mausbach and Seidel,[<a name="text18" href="#foot18">18</a>] that
 Augustine did not deny the goods of human life, but sought to raise them to a
 higher power. That may be taken as one side. That there is another, the purely
 other-worldly, which treats as null all earthly activities including the State,
 is not to be denied on any fair reading.[<a name="text19" href="#foot19">19</a>]
 The world-renouncing and the world-accepting temper both meet in S. Augustine,
 as they do in the Christian Church and its most eminent representatives, S.
 Paul, S. Anselm, S. Francis de Sales, Fénelon, Newman. It must be this latter
 element which gives Renter the ground to state that for Augustine the only true
 State is a monastic community, and that all the rest are condemned ; though I do
 not know what real evidence there is of this statement. The former is that which
 can justify Mausbach[<a name="text20" href="#foot20">20</a>] in saying that
 nothing that we call 'kultur' is recognised by S. Augustine. All this, however,
 can only be fully discussed if we consider the place in his system of the
 Christian Church. That must be taken next time.</p>
 <p>Notes to Lecture III</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot01" href="#text01">1</a>] Seidel, <i>Die Lehre des heiligen
 Augustinus vom Staate </i>(in Sdralek's <i>Kirchengeschichtliche Abhandlungen,</i>
 1909,IX. i.), p.4534, d.11, Band 8-10.</p>
 <p>'Es ist wohl zu optimistisch, wenn Mausbach meint, es sei allgemein anerkannt,
 dass der Ausdruck <i>civitas terrena </i>meist nicht den Staat als solchen
 bezeichne. Meines Erachtens rühren viele Irrtümer eben gerade daher, dass man
 immer wieder <i>civitas terrena </i>mit "Staat" übersetzt.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot02" href="#text02">2</a>] Reuter, p. 131.</p>
 <p>'Indessen scheint es mir doch nicht überflüssig zu sein, daran zu erinnern,
 dass das Wort nicht mit Staat, sondern <i>Stadt </i>zu übersetzen sei.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot03" href="#text03">3</a>] T. Sommerlad, <i>Das
 Wirtschaftsprogramm der Kirche des Mittel alters, </i>p. 216. (This book
 emphasises his differences from all forerunners. They are reactionary, he is
 communistic.)</p>
 <p>'Es liegt in all dem Gesagten begründet, weshalb Augustin, der eine Staats-
 und Gesellschaftstheorie geben wollte, entgegen seiner Absicht ein
 Staatsprogramm und ein Wirtschaftsprogramm geschaffen hat.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot04" href="#text04">4</a>] Reuter, p. 477.</p>
 <p>'In dem <i>Liber de opere monachorum, </i>S. 438-443, vielleicht dei
 bedeutendsten Schrift in der Geschichte der Wirtschaftslehre seit Ende des
 vierten Jahrhunderts, sind Gedanken entwickelt, welche praktisch geworden, die
 auch von Aug. festgehaltene Differenz des weltlichen und geistlichen Lebens
 hätten auflösen, eine soziale Reform (Revolution?) in römische Reiche hatten
 motivieren müssen.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot05" href="#text05">5</a>] Somerlad, <i>Wirtschaftsprogramm, </i>p.
 210.</p>
 <p>'Die Eigentümlichkeit der Staatstheorie Augustins besteht nun darin dass
 jene teleologische Betrachtung, wie sie das Evangelium den wirtschaftlichen
 Institututionen gegenüber eingeschlagen hatte, auch auf die Institution des
 Staates angewandt wird.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot06" href="#text06">6</a>] Ritschl, <i>Ueber die Methode der
 älteren Dogmengeschichte, </i>in <i>Gesammette Aufsätze, </i>i. 156.</p>
 <p>'Er in ihrer katholischen Gestalt das Reich Gottes selbst erkennt, welches
 seit dem Sündenfalle seine Existenz gegenüber dem irdischen Reiche hat; dieses
 aber ist der Weltstaat, wie er in der römischen Herrschaft jener Zeit
 gegenwärtig war. Wie nun die Kirche als die <i>Civitas Dei </i>der Organismus
 des Guten aus dem Prinzip der gottgemässen Gerechtigkeit ist, so gilt dem
 Augustin der Staat als die Gemeinschaft der Menschen aus dem Princip der Sünde.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot07" href="#text07">7</a>] H. von Eicken, <i>Geschichte und
 System der Mittelalterlichen Weltanschauung, </i>p. 119. 'So bald die Kirche
 sich gesetzlich geschützt sah, gab sie ihrer Geringachtung gegen den Staat
 einen noch offeneren, rückhaltsloseren, Ausdruck als vordem.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot08" href="#text08">8</a>] Reuter, p. 151.</p>
 <p>'Man kann die Staatslehre Augustin's nur mit äusserster Vorsicht und selbst
 dann nicht vollständig aus den <i>Lib. de Civ. </i>schöpfen. Sie ist korrekt
 nur unter Vergleichung anderer Schriften, namentlich der anti-donatistischen
 aufzubauen.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot09" href="#text09">9</a>] Reuter, p. 143.</p>
 <p>'Je schroffer die letzteren [Donatisten] die alte Ansicht von dem Staate als
 einem profanen, dem Christentum fremden Gemeinwesen erneuerten und überspannten,
 um so mehr wurde der Apologet des Katholicismus genötigt, die sittliche Würde
 desselben darzulegen.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot10" href="#text10">10</a>] <i>De Civitate, </i>xix. 23.</p>
 <p>'Quapropter ubi non est ista justitia, ut secundum suam gratiam civitati
 oboedienti Deus imperet unus et summus, ne cuiquam sacrificet nisi tantum sibi;
 et per hoc in omnibus hominibus ad eandem civitatem pertinentibus atque
 oboedientibus Deo animus etiam corpori, atque ratio vitiis, ordine legitimo
 fideliter imperet; ut quemadmodum Justus unus, ita coetus populusque justorum
 vivat, ex fide quae operatur per dilectionem, qua homo diligit Deum, sicut
 diligendus est Deus, et proximum sicut seipsum--ubi ergo non est ista justitia,
 profecto non est coetus hominum juris consensu, et utilitatis communione
 sociatus. Quod si non est, utique populus non est, si vera est haec populi
 definitio. Ergo nec respublica est, quia res populi non est, ubi ipse populus
 non est.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot11" href="#text11">11</a>] Seidel, p. 21.</p>
 <p>'Wenn also der Staat auch nicht die <i>veritas iustitiae </i>haben muss, um
 Staat zu sein, so muss er doch eine <i>iustitia </i>haben, um nicht als
 Räuberbande zu gelten. Es ist die auf der Vernunft beruhende natür-liche
 Gerechtigkeit, welche Augustin dem Staate als wesentlich zuschreibt. Er findet
 diese <i>iustitia </i>auchbei den heidnischen Römern.' <i>Cf. </i>Reuter, 137 <i>sqq.</i></p>
 
 <p>[<a name="foot12" href="#text12">12</a>] Seidel, p. 20.</p>
 <p>'Mit allem Nachdruck ist hervorzuheben, dass der heilige Augustinus die
 Wesensbestimmung, welche Cicero vom Staate gibt, als zu eng ablehnt.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot13" href="#text13">13</a>] Eckstädt, <i>Augustins Anschauung
 vom Staat </i>(Kirkhain, 1912), pp. 27-29, argues that the real importance lies
 in the word concord.</p>
 <p>'Berücksichtigt man alle diese Stellen, so kann nach meiner Meinung gar
 nicht bezweifelt werden dass die concordia dem Augustin unerlässlich ist für
 das Wesen des Staates; und dies bestätigt sich uns</p>
 <p>weiter, wenn wir auf das höchste Gut sehen, das Augustin für den Staat
 fordert: pax.'</p>
 <p><a name="foot*" href="#text*">*</a> I do not say more than plausible, because
 the body which has power to change the constitution would be the Austinian
 sovereign. But there are two ways in the U.S.A. of altering the constitution.
 Which makes the sovereign?</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot14" href="#text14">14</a>] Mausbach, ii. 364.</p>
 <p>'Also handelt es sich nicht um Umwandlung eines Bösen zum Guten, sondern um
 die Vermehrung und Erhöhung eines Guten.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot15" href="#text15">15</a>] Seidel, p. 25.</p>
 <p>'Die Begrifie des "christlichen" oder "nichtchristlichen"
 Staates finden sich also nicht bei Augustin, sondern diese Bezeichnungen sind
 von <i>uns </i>gewählt, um vom Christentum beeinflusste oder nichtbeein-flusste
 Staaten zu unterscheiden.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot16" href="#text16">16</a>] Eckstädt, p. 40.</p>
 <p>'So nach Augustins eigenen Urteil, ist der Staat um so besser, je besser das
 ist was er liebt. So ist der christliche Staat nicht dem Wesen nach der ideale
 Staat, wohl aber seinem Inhalte nach der Werthvollste.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot17" href="#text17">17</a>] F. Dahn, <i>Die Könige der Germanen
 </i>(Leipzig, 1908), xi. 209.</p>
 <p>'Die Unterschätzung von Recht und Staat gegenüber der Kirche . . . ist die
 notwendige Folge der Lehre Sankt Augustins, einer logisch falschen, sittlich
 krankhaften, politisch verderblichen, mit den Pflichten gegen den Staat
 unvereinbaren.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot18" href="#text18">18</a>] Seidel, p. 26.</p>
 <p>'So wird auch der Staat als naturgemässe und darum berechtigte menschliche
 Ordnung durch das Übernatürliche des Christentums nicht als unberechtigt
 aufgehoben, sondern von Mängeln befreit, in seinem Wesen vervollkommnet und in
 seiner Bedeutung erhöht.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot19" href="#text19">19</a>] H. Weinand, <i>Die Gottesidee der
 Grundzug der Weltanschauung des hi. Augustinus, </i>p. 127.</p>
 <p>'Die Welt zu entwerten stellte er sie mit all ihren Güten neben Gott,
 verglich beide miteinander, wog sie gegeneinander ab ; kein Wunder dass sie zu
 leicht befunden ward und ihm Gott gegenüber als nicht-gut, nicht-schön; ja als
 ein Nicht-Sein erschien.'</p>
 <p>[<a name="foot20" href="#text20">20</a>] Mausbach, i. 350.</p>
 <p>'Was aber Augustins Stellung zur Kultur in ganzen angeht, so unterliegt es
 nach unsern Untersuchungen keinem Zweifel, dass er alle Werte und Ziele, die wir
 heute zum Begriffe der Kultur rechnen, zur Geltung und zu Ehren kommen lässt.'</p>
