 <h2 align="CENTER">GENERAL SCOPE OF THE 'DE CIVITATE DEI'</h2>
 <p>'As Man amongst creatures and the Church amongst men and the Fathers in the
 Church, and S. Augustine amongst the Fathers, so amongst the many pretious
 volumes and in the rich storehouse of his workes, his bookes of the City of God
 have a speciall preheminence.'</p>
 <p>So W. Crashawe began the dedication which he prefixed in 1620 to the second
 edition of J. Healey's translation of the text and of the Commentary thereon of
 J. L. Vives. Vives had dedicated his Commentary to Henry VIII, dating from
 Louvain on July 7, 1522.</p>
 <p>This passage of Crashawe we might parallel from writers of almost every age;
 and from some of widely different outlook. Bishop Otto of Freising, the uncle
 and historian of Frederic Barbarossa, sings in unison with Niceron, the
 collector of literary anecdotes in the seventeenth century.</p>
 <p>The greatness of the 'De Civitate Dei' is not in dispute. No student of the
 fifth century can afford to overlook it. No one can understand the Middle Ages
 without taking it into account. What is true of historians is true no less of
 ecclesiastical politicians and reformers--even down to a leader in the modern
 socialist movement like Sommerlad.[<a name="text01" href="#footnote01">1</a>] In
 his earlier days Count Hertling has written on the book, and he alluded to its
 principles in a recent speech. The book has been more widely read than any other
 of S. Augustine except the 'Confessions.' It has had commentators from Coquaeus
 down to Scholz. For these reasons it might seem hardly a fitting topic for
 'Pringle-Stewart' lectures. One historian said to me on hearing of the Course:
 'Is there anything new to say about that?' Yet another said, that the more he
 tried to comprehend the mind of the Middle Ages, the more was he convinced that
 it was necessary to understand S. Augustine.</p>
 <p>That understanding is not easy. There are those who are for treating S.
 Augustine as the typical example of the medieval temperament with its heights
 and depths, its glories and splendours of imagination, its dialectical ingenuity
 and its irrational superstitions. Others see in S. Augustine essentially a man
 of the antique world. They do not deny to him real influence upon later times.
 Who can? But they are inclined to minimise this; at least in matters of social
 and political importance. The former is the view of Dorner, still more of
 Feuerlein.[<a name="text02" href="#footnote02">2</a>] It became a commonplace
 with scholars like Gierke and Ritschl, and in a less degree with Harnack. It is
 presented in an extreme form in a book, once well known, that came from America,
 the late Dr. A. V. G. Alien's ' Continuity of Christian Thought.' Hermann Reuter
 in his 'Augustinische Studien' began a reaction. That book is of incalculable
 value for those who wish to comprehend S. Augustine. This reaction reached its
 limit in a book published during the war, by Troeltsch, 'Die christliche Antike
 und die Mittelalter.' Signs of this view are to be found in Dr. Carlyle's
 valuable work on 'Political Theory in the West'--although it is more through
 what he does not say than what he does, that we gather the views of the writer.
 Professor Dunning in his 'History of Political Thought' is even more significant
 in his omissions.</p>
 <p>Political thought and S. Augustine's influence thereon are to be the topic of
 these lectures. That involves the whole subject of Church and State. So we are
 carried some way into theology. The ' De Civitate Dei' is not a treatise on
 politics. It is a <i>lime de circonstance </i>concerned with apologetic. Most of
 S. Augustine's doctrine alike in theology and philosophy is embedded in it. We
 may regard it as an expansion of the 'Confessions.' The relation of true
 philosophy to scepticism, the idea of creation, the problem of time, the
 contribution of Platonism, more especially Neo-Platonism, the meaning of miracle
 and nature, the Incarnation as expressing the humility of God, the whole scheme
 of redemption, salvation by grace, long divagations into comparative mythology,
 all these might be made the subject of lectures on the 'De Civitate Dei,' and
 that without leaving the <i>terrain </i>occupied by the author. Another lecturer
 better equipped might give not six but twelve lectures concerning the
 philosophic and theological problems suggested by the 'De Civitate Dei,' and not
 even mention those points which I hope to discuss. If that had been what was
 expected, you would not have done me the high honour of choosing me to lecture
 on this work. To begin with, a great Augustinian scholar, Canon T. A. Lacey, in
 the first course of 'Pringle-Stewart' lectures discussed some of the more
 important of these matters, although without special reference to this book. You
 would not wish them discussed again by one who has neither Mr. Lacey's intimate
 knowledge of S. Augustine nor his alertness of critical judgment. So I shall
 limit myself to the political aspects of the book.</p>
 <p>The points which it offers to the student of political thought are not few,
 nor are they unimportant. The book has been treated as a philosophy of history
 finer than that of Hegel; and again as the herald of all that is significant in
 the 'Scienza Nuova' of Vico. Can such views be sustained? Or is it the case that
 S. Augustine had no notion of a philosophy of history, that his views are
 self-contradictory, and that only a few passages throw more than a faint light
 on it. That question will form the topic of the second lecture. Did S. Augustine
 teach, that the State is the organisation of sin, or did he believe in its God
 given character, and desire its developments? Did he teach the political
 supremacy of the hierarchy, and, by implication, that of the Pope and the
 Inquisition? Or was it of the Church as the <i>Communio sanctorum </i>that he
 was thinking? Does his doctrine of individual election reduce to ruins all
 ecclesiastical theory? These topics will occupy the third and fourth lectures.
 What was S. Augustine's influence on mediæval life? Was there something almost
 like a 'reception' of Augustinianism, followed by a repudiation at the
 Renaissance? Or was it that only slightly he affected political ideals in the
 Middle Ages? Some see the whole controversy between Popes and Emperors implicit
 in the 'De Civitate Dei.' Others would trace it to causes quite different. What
 real change came about at the Reformation? Did S. Augustine's social doctrine
 (apart from the theology of grace) lose all influence? Or did men retain
 unimpaired the idea of the <i>civitas Dei, </i>as it had been developed? These
 questions will occupy the last two lectures.</p>
 <p>To-day let me try to determine certain preliminary points. Let us get clear
 what is the nature and aim of the book. Much needs to be said which will seem
 trite to students. I would crave your pardon. These matters are needful for
 evidence of what will later be said. Besides, it is a less error to take too
 little for granted than too much.</p>
 <p>Like nearly all of S. Augustine's writings, the 'De Civitate Dei' is
 controversial. It is a pamphlet of large scale. Like S. Paul and unlike S.
 Thomas, Augustine wrote only under the pressure of immediate necessity. All his
 writings have an apologetic character. Most of them are coloured by his
 intensely rich personality. Trained in rhetoric, Augustine is never abstract or
 impersonal. Sometimes we regret this and the <i>longueurs </i>to which his skill
 in dialectic leads him. Theories abound in S. Augustine's works, but the last
 thing he is is a theorist, pure and simple. Augustine became a theologian, as he
 had become a philosopher, driven by practical needs. Adversaries might even
 argue that all his emphasis on the external, on the given quality of grace, was
 due to his own experiences--just as Luther universalised his own inner life
 into the doctrine of justification by faith. We must see the place which these
 controversies, implied in the 'De Civitate,' occupied in S. Augustine's life.
 After his conversion, he spent the first years in assailing the doctrines of
 which he had been an adherent. We have the books 'Contra Academicos,' the
 'Soliloquy' and other writings against the Manichæans. In these he is concerned
 with problems mainly speculative, the nature and origin of evil, the nature of
 belief, the possibility of certitude, the significance of error, which at least
 is evidence of the personality of the man in error, and so forth.</p>
 <p>To these controversies succeeded his great conflict with the Donatists. When
 he was converted, Augustine did not become a merely intellectual adherent of
 Christianity. He became a member of a visible, active and world-wide Church; and
 that in a day of storms. When Augustine came home to Africa, after his mother's
 death, he found the Church rent by schism, with the Catholics appearing as the
 weaker party, and the Donatists claiming almost a national position. Augustine
 was forced into the position of a champion of the Catholic Church. Consequently,
 more in regard to schism than to heresy, he developed the idea of the unity and
 universality of the Church. He thus marked a difference between himself and
 Greek theologians like Origen.</p>
 <p>Then came the sack of Rome by Alaric. Only in our own time can the shock of
 that world-catastrophe be paralleled in its effect on the imagination and
 thoughts of men. The eternity of Rome had been a presupposition of the common
 consciousness. But now the world seemed in ruins--<i>i.e.</i> the world of
 imagination and mental comfort. Augustine saw that the taking of Rome had no
 'great military significance.' In one sermon he bids his hearers be calm and
 recollect that Rome really means Romans--and that the Roman name was not
 extinguished. The calamity gave its last chance to dying paganism. Rome had been
 a stronghold of the ancient worship, and was still largely pagan in feeling.
 Obvious then was its line of counterattack. 'This horror would not have been,
 had we stood by the ancient ways. The mad policy of the Emperors in prohibiting
 sacrifices to the gods has produced its inevitable nemesis. The sack of Rome is
 the judgment of Jove.'</p>
 <p>This was the position in which Augustine was placed, one somewhat resembling
 that of a modern Christian faced with the charge that Christianity is bankrupt
 because it did not prevent the war. To meet the charge Augustine wrote the 'De
 Civitate Dei.' He did not write it all at once. In the 'Retractations' he admits
 that he was interrupted by the Pelagian controversy. That too leaves its traces
 upon this encyclopedia of his mind. Much of the book is but an expansion of
 Augustine's doctrine of grace applied on the scale of world history. That is
 another reason why the book is so hard. Augustine had a discursive mind, and his
 training in rhetoric increased this tendency. He had no great powers of
 construction. The architectonics even of the 'Confessions' leave much to be
 desired--a fact which is less patent than it should be to many because they do
 not read the latter books. In his controversial writings he does not know when
 to stop; nor does he trouble much about relevance. We can never understand S.
 Augustine if we think of him as a system-maker. Systems may have come out of
 him, but before all else he is a personality. He is the meeting-place of two
 worlds. All that the training of that day in the West could give-- he knew
 little or no Greek--he had. His mind was a mould into which the culture of the
 world was poured. This he had either to assimilate to Christianity, or to
 eliminate from himself. Sometimes he is inclined to do the latter. Hence his
 inconsistencies; and in consequence many different people could justify
 themselves out of his writings. Augustine is not, as some think, a pure ascetic
 without interest in human life, careless of the goods of learning--but
 sometimes he seems to be that. He is a rich, hot-blooded, highly complex and
 introspective personality, passionately Christian, but exquisitely and
 delicately human, sensitive and courageous, looking with reverence on Rome,
 possessed, with Virgil and Cicero, of a Roman love of authority and law, and an
 African touch of earth, yet ever withal having the <i>nostalgia of the infinite.
 </i>Within Augustine there struggle two personalities, a mystic, who could forgo
 all forms, not only of outward but of inward mechanism, and fly straight--'the
 alone to the Alone' --with a champion of ecclesiastical order, resolute to
 secure the rights of the Church, and a statesman looking before and after.</p>
 <p>One constant temptation besets the historian of thought in every sphere. He
 is apt to suppose that his subjects are more consistent than they are; to make
 logical wholes of scattered and often contradictory hints; and sometimes even to
 rule out, as unauthentic, writings which have no other evidence against them
 than that of being hard to reconcile with others of the same author. In no case
 could this be a worse error than in that of S. Augustine; in no part of S.
 Augustine could it be worse than in the 'De Civitate Dei.' One student has said:
 'It is not a book, it is journalism; whenever S. Augustine had nothing else to
 do he sat down and wrote a bit of it.' That may be fancy. But it is a fanciful
 way of conveying a truth. Let us then take the work right through, and give an
 account of it, not troubling about its logical consistency or the relevance of
 parts to the main idea.</p>
 <p>In the 'Retractations' Augustine gave his own analysis of it, though a very
 brief one. The first five books are a reply to those who say that the pagan gods
 are to be worshipped for the sake of earthly security and peace. The next five
 are a reply to the contention of the philosophic apologists that the worship of
 old Roman gods leads to the real good, eternal life. The pagans having been
 routed, Augustine turned to construction. This is divided into three parts. In
 Books XI-XIV we have the origin of the two cities, the <i>Civitas Dei </i>and
 the <i>Civitas terrena</i>;<i> </i>in the next four he traces their course in
 time, and in the last four their consummation in eternity.</p>
 <p>Let us go through the work in further detail. In Book I, Augustine states
 that his object in writing is to rebut the charge that Christianity has ruined
 Rome. He shows that temporal felicity had not been the unvarying condition for
 the city of Rome. Besides, the same gods had failed to protect Troy, or else
 Æneas would never have reached Italy. Even at the time of writing,
 Christianity, he claims, is having its effect, in getting better treatment for
 the vanquished. Pagans-- the very men who attack the Church--go running to the
 churches to take sanctuary. There they are safe. Augustine does not claim that a
 complete acceptance of<b> </b>Christianity would guarantee the life of a nation.</p>
 <p>The laments over a toppling order, he will not meet by saying that a
 Christian commonwealth now or at any future date will be stable. What marks this
 book is the final repudiation of the old views, as much Jewish as pagan, that
 temporal felicity follows the service of the true God--alike for the individual
 and the nation.</p>
 <p>The wicked, either man or nation, may flourish like a green bay tree, says S.
 Augustine, and often will. That will not advantage the wicked in the end, which
 is outside this life. But it will teach the good man humility and a due
 dependence on the eternal values. The world may be saved. But it will be saved
 on other-worldly lines. Hermann Reuter is right in saying that the whole world
 turns on the contrast between worldly and other-worldly motives.[<a name="text03" href="#footnote03">3</a>]</p>
 <p>Augustine replies to the charge against the Christians by a doctrine
 concerning the nature of religion which makes the topic of temporal felicity
 irrelevant. This method was a revolution. Like most of S. Augustine's thought--and
 some of Christian teaching--it was neither entirely novel nor exclusively
 Christian. It rests on the philosophic conception of God as the <i>summum bonum.
 </i>'What is the chief end of man? To glorify God and to enjoy Him for ever.'
 This may be a summary of the Christian ideal, but it includes within it the
 Neo-Platonist also and many others. Augustine was aware of this, and in the
 second part he will meet and refute the argument that eternal goods are to be
 won by the worship of the pagan deities. Meanwhile he is occupied with those who
 complain of the evil wrought by Christianity. Against them he points out the
 luxury and corruption of Rome, all the ills predicted by Scipio if Carthage
 should be destroyed and Jeshurun wax fat with that lust of sovereignty which
 among all other sins of the world was most appropriate unto the Romans. He
 depicts the tragedies produced by the lust of power describes the hideous
 sexualities current in the theatre and in certain worships not yet discarded,
 despite all the Gothic peril. He concludes by sketching his plan to point out
 (1) the evils that befel Rome in early days; (2) the uselessness, so proved, of
 the old gods even for temporal ends; (3) their even greater uselessness for
 eternal bliss.</p>
 <p>The second book is mainly concerned with the profound moral gulf between
 paganism and Christianity. Therein Augustine makes lavish use of the 'De
 Republica' of Cicero. He describes in detail the decay of Roman manners during
 the last days of the Republic, glancing at the moral and political passions
 which preceded and provoked the Imperial regime. This book is designed to
 establish the now familiar thesis of the moral and political corruption produced
 by paganism, and concludes with an exhortation to the Romans to renounce it.</p>
 <p>Book III describes the miseries that ushered in and accompanied the triumphs
 of Rome. With these are contrasted the golden times of peace under King Numa and
 the wickedness of the attack on Alba Longa. Emphasis is thus laid on the
 miseries inherent in the pagan state as an expression of pagan ethics and
 religion.</p>
 <p>In Book IV Augustine lays down that justice is to be set before power, and
 that alike by by nations and individuals. We come to the maxim on which so much
 more must be said: <i>Remota justitia, quid regna nisi magna latrocinia. </i>The
 Roman Empire he seems on the whole to have viewed as a just reward earned partly
 as the due of Roman virtue and partly in compensation for unjust attacks; but he
 is not always consistent. He speaks of the lust of power of Ninus and the
 Assyrian Empire. Here we come in Chapters 3 and 15 to strongly anti-imperialist
 passages. Thence Augustine proceeds (C. 11) to consider the more refined forms
 of paganism-- those which take the individual deities as names for the
 attributes of the one supreme God who was often interpreted pantheistically. He
 decides that Jove was at least no final organiser of victory for his children,
 and in that noteworthy passage (IV, 15) he argues in favour of a society of
 small States, 'little in quantity and peaceful in neighbourly agreement,' as
 against the aggregations of empire. Once more he makes easy game of the
 puerilities of polytheism, and denounces its obscene festivals. Thence he passes
 to the more serious doctrine of Varro, for whom Augustine entertained the
 greatest respect. Acute and learned, with a prodigious memory, Varro is
 Augustine's main authority for mythology-- just as later on Vico, who knew
 Varro mainly through the 'De Civitate Dei,' is driven at every turn to appeal to
 him. Varro was a Theist or Pantheist of a kind, and like Augustine worshipped a
 Providence, the bestower of kingdoms, who grants his boons to bad no less than
 good, like a parent giving toys. The book concludes with the assertion that God
 is the giver of all kingdoms and the determiner of their end, and with
 illustrations drawn from the Jewish State.</p>
 <p>Book V enters into the problem of freedom and necessity. Despite his strong
 predestinarian doctrine Augustine was no believer in a blind fate--any more
 than was Calvin. Empire he holds, has been given to the Romans as the reward of
 certain terrestrial virtues. Great qualities of courage and self-sacrifice
 belong or did belong to Roman patriots. No pagan could be more eloquent than he
 is on their grandeur. He will even set them as an example for the citizens of
 the heavenly city. 'The argonauts of the ideal' are bidden to emulate the zeal
 and sacrifice which Romans had shown for a cause so far inferior. The well-known
 passage from the sixth Æneid, <i>excudent alii spirantia mollius aera, </i>is
 used to illustrate Roman imperialism (V, 12). Augustine argues that ambition may
 be a vice, but that it acts in restraint.</p>
 <p>of worse vices, cowardice and indolence. Even here the Christian martyr is
 superior. He despised earthly honours and endured worse torments. The Romans had
 not the true end of doing God's will. Hence they could have no eternal hope.
 Their relative goodness would have gone unrewarded, and God's justice therefore
 would for ever be assailable, had not an earthly sovereignty been their meed.
 That species of power is other in kind than the eternal joy of the children of
 God. Yet once more must Augustine assert that it is the true God who gave Rome
 her Empire and who presides over the origin and issue of all wars. There he
 anticipates the argument of Dante. Rhadagaisus, the Gothic king, whom they all
 know, forms a shining example of this divine supervision in his sudden and
 incalculable downfall.</p>
 <p>Following this passage is the famous <i>Fürsten-spiegel, </i>the picture of
 a godly prince (V, 24). Somewhat to our surprise, Augustine chooses as an
 instance Constantine the Great. Maybe he knew less ill of him than we do. At
 least this choice shows how entirely Roman was Augustine. Theodosius the Great
 is then made the topic of a panegyric, for he grudged not to assist the
 labouring Church by all the wholesome laws which he promulgated against
 heretics.</p>
 <p>Augustine's first part concludes with Book V. He is now to be occupied in
 showing that paganism is wrong even as a method of approach to the True God.</p>
 <p>Vulgar paganism is now demolished. We pass in Book VI to the philosophic
 creeds. An interesting appreciation of Varro precedes an account of his book on
 'Human and Divine Antiquities' which indeed we know largely through the use
 Augustine makes of it. Varro divides religion into three stages, somewhat after
 the manner of Comte. There is <i>(a) </i>the mythical, followed by <i>(b) </i>the
 natural and <i>(c) </i>the civic. He prefers the second. Augustine tries to show
 the connexion between the two, and denies that paganism can be detached from its
 darker side. It is vain to worship pagan deities in the hope of eternal bliss.
 Book VII carries the matter a little further, and argues the inconsistency of
 Varro.</p>
 <p>Book VIII treats of the Platonic doctrine of God. This in the main Augustine
 accepts; but he treats as futile the attempt to accommodate it with the worship
 of the pagan pantheon. Apuleius, the African representative of paganism, is
 discussed. We have vigorous words in abuse of magic. The heathen practice of
 apotheosis is contrasted with the honours given to the Christian martyr. This,
 he says, is high reverence, but in no sense do we treat the martyrs as gods.
 Book IX is concerned with a further condemnation of the doctrine of mediating
 spirits and demons. Thence Augustine passes to the doctrine of the One Mediator,
 and argues the possibility of the Incarnation. The Book shows that the debate
 between the Christian apologist and his assailants is at bottom a conflict
 between two forms of mediation.</p>
 <p>Book X contains a further analysis of Plotinus, whose doctrine Augustine
 parallels with the Logos doctrine of S. John i. He contrasts the one sacrifice,
 once offered, with the offerings to idols; and the Christian with the pagan
 miracles. In Chapter 25 he argues that all good men in every age are saved, but
 saved through faith in Christ, <i>e.g. </i>the saints of the Old Testament. Then
 we have more argument for the Incarnation. Augustine sees the fundamental
 difficulty in Incarnation, a self-limitation of God which is all but
 intolerable. It is this doctrine of the humility of God at which imagination
 boggles. 'These proud fellows scorn to have God for their Master, because the
 Word became Flesh and dwelt among us.'</p>
 <p>The last words of Book X sum up the first part of the whole:</p>
 <p>'In these ten books I have spoken by the good assistance of God sufficient in
 sound judgments (though some expected more) against the impious contradictors
 that prefer their gods before the founder of the holy city, whereof we are to
 dispute. The first five of the ten opposed them that adored their gods for
 temporal respects; the five later against those that adored them for the life to
 come. It remains now, according as we promised in the first book, to proceed in
 our discourse of the two cities that are confused together in this world, and
 distinct in the other; of whose original, progress, and consummation I now enter
 to dispute, evermore invoking the assistance of the Almighty.'</p>
 <p>Now at last in Book XI we get to the two cities. Augustine begins by proving
 that the universe and time began together. The City of God begins with the
 creation of light, <i>i.e. </i>with the angels; and the other with the sin of
 Satan. The doctrine of the Trinity is expounded, and Augustine emphasises his
 view that evil is a defect of will, not of nature, once more attacking the
 Manichæan dualism. 'Let there be light' signifies the creation of the angelic
 hierarchy.</p>
 <p>Book XII once more discusses the relations of the good and evil angels.
 Augustine meets and denies the doctrine of the longevity of the world, of the
 Antipodes, of an eternal recurrence. He goes on to the creation of man. Book
 XIII describes the fall, and its consequence in death. He combats the view that
 death was inevitable, not penal. In Book XIV we proceed to the ordinary doctrine
 of the irruption of grace. After dilating on the evils of sin, he describes the
 two cities more at large in Chapter 28.</p>
 <p>'Two loves therefore have given original to these two cities--self-love in
 contempt of God unto the earthly; love of God in contempt of one's self to the
 heavenly. The first seeks the glory of men and the latter desires God only as
 the testimony of conscience, the greatest glory. That glories in itself, and
 this in God. That exalts itself in self-glory; this says to God, "My glory,
 the lifter of my head." That boasts of the ambitious conquerors, led by the
 lust of sovereignty: in this everyone serves the other in charity, both the
 rulers in counselling and the subjects in obeying. That loves worldly virtue in
 the potentates; this says unto God, "I will love thee, O Lord, my
 strength." And the wise men of that follow either the good things of the
 body or mind or both, living according to the flesh, and such as might know God
 honoured him not as God, nor were thankful, but all were vain in their own
 imaginations, and their foolish heart was darkened; for professing themselves to
 be wise-- that is, extolling themselves proudly in their own wisdom-- they
 became fools, changing the glory of the incorruptible God to the likeness of the
 image of a corruptible man and of birds and fourfooted beasts and serpents: for
 they were the people's guides or followers into all those idolatries, and served
 the creature more than the Creator, who is blessed for ever. But in this other
 the heavenly city, there is no wisdom of man, but only the piety that serves the
 true God, and expects a reward in the society of the holy angels and men, that
 God may be all in all.'</p>
 <p>Book XV begins with the contrary course of the two cities in history. Cain
 built the first city; not Abel, who was always a pilgrim.</p>
 <p>'It is recorded of Cain that he built the city, but Abel was a pilgrim and
 built none. For the city of the saints is above, though it have citizens here
 upon earth, wherein it lives as a pilgrim until the time of the kingdom come,
 and then it gathers all the citizens together in the resurrection of the body
 and gives them a kingdom to reign in with their king for ever and ever.'</p>
 <p>Chapter 4 describes the earthly city. Peace is the aim of its life. This it
 can win only by war. Cain's effort is compared with the building of Rome by
 Romulus, who also slew his brother. Once more he compares them in regard to Seth
 and Enos.</p>
 <p>In XV, 21 he sums it up:</p>
 <p>'Thus the two cities are described to be seated, the one in worldly
 possession, the other in heavenly hopes, both coming out at the common gate of
 mortality, which was opened in Adam; out of whose condemned race, as out of a
 putrefied lump, God elected some vessels of mercy and some of wrath; giving due
 pains unto the one, and undue grace unto the other, that the citizens of God
 upon earth may take this lesson from the vessels of wrath, never to rely on
 their own election, but hope to call upon the name of the Lord: because the
 natural will which God made (but yet here the Unchangeable made it not
 changeless) may both decline from Him that is good and from all good to do evil,
 and that by freedom of will: and from evil also to do good, but that not without
 God's assistance.'</p>
 <p>Book XVI goes on with the history. Augustine condemns in parentheses the idea
 of inhabitants at the Antipodes. The supreme type of the earthly city is the
 Tower of Babel. The course continues until the second period, that of Abraham,
 and the third, that of the Mosaic Law. From now onwards the city of God becomes
 represented for practical purposes by the Hebrew nation. Therefore it takes on
 some of the qualities of an earthly State. This gives occasion to S. Augustine
 to argue that all the promises of permanence in the Old Testament could not
 refer to the Jewish State but must have their fulfilment in that city eternal in
 the heavens. This is true in especial of all the promises to David (XVII, 16).
 He is led to argue that peace is no enduring condition on earth, but belongs of
 right only to the life beyond.</p>
 <p>In Book XVIII we get to the course of the <i>civitas terrena, i.e. </i>the
 whole topic of Vico. That is represented in the Assyrian monarchy; but certain
 criticisms of Grecian myths and Egypt occur. We may cite here the vivid words of
 Vives on the following chapters:</p>
 <p>'In this eighteenth book we were to pass many dark ways and oftentimes to
 feel for our passage, daring not fix one foot until we first groped where to
 place it, as one must do in dark and dangerous places. Here we cannot tarry all
 day at Rome, but must abroad into the world's farthest corner, into lineages
 long since lost, and countries worn quite out of memory; pedigrees long ago laid
 in the depth of oblivion must we fetch out into the light like Cerberus, and
 spread them openly. We must into Assyria, that old monarchy scarcely once named
 by the Greeks; and Sycionia, which the very princes thereof sought to suppress
 from memory themselves, debarring their very fathers from having their names set
 on their tombs, as Pausanias relateth; and thence to Argos, which being held the
 most antique state of Greece is all enfolded in fables; then Athens, whose
 nimble wits aiming all at their country's honour, have left truth sick at the
 heart, they have so cloyed it with eloquence and wrapped it up in cloudes. Nor
 is Augustine content with this, but here and there casteth in hard walnuts and
 almonds for us to crack, which puts us to shrewd trouble ere we can get out the
 kernel of truth, their shells are so thick. And then cometh the Latin gests, all
 hacked in pieces by the discord of authors. And thence to the Romans; nor are
 the Greek wise men omitted. It is fruitless to complain lest some should think I
 do it causeless. And here and there the Hebrew, runneth like veins in the body,
 to show the full course of the Two Cities, the Heavenly and the Earthly. If any
 one travelling through those countries and learning his way of the cunningest
 should for all that miss his way sometimes, is not he pardonable? If any pass
 through, will anyone think him less diligent in his travel? None, I think. What
 then if chance or ignorance lead me astray out of the sight of divers mean
 villages that I should have gone by, my way lying through deserts and untracked
 woods and seldom, or never, finding any to ask the right way of. Am I not to be
 borne with? I hope yes. Varro's Antiquities are all lost; and the life of Rome.
 None but Eusebius helped me in Assyria, but that Diodorus Siculus and some
 others set me in once or twice.</p>
 <p>I had a book by me called Berosus by the booksellers, and somewhat I had of
 Joannes Annius, goodly matters truly, able to fright away the reader at first
 sight. But I let them lie still; I love not to suck the dregs or fetch fables
 out of frivolous pamphlets, the very rackets wherewith Greece bandieth ignorant
 heads about. Had this work been a child of Berosus I<i> </i>had used it
 willingly; but it looketh like a bastard of a Greek sire. . . . If any man like
 such stuff, much good may it do him. I will be none of his rival. . . .
 Concerning Athens, Rome, Argos, Latium, and the other fabulous subjects, the
 reader hath heard whatsoever my diversity of reading affordeth, and much from
 the most curious students therein that I could be acquainted withall. He that
 liketh not this thing, may find another, by and by, that will please his palate
 better, unless he be so proudly testy that he would have these my pains for the
 public good, of power to satisfy him only. The rest, the Commentaries themselves
 will tell you' (On <i>De Civitate, </i>XVIII, i.)</p>
 <p>Prophecy comes in and the conflicts of philosophers. The rise and early
 progress of Christianity are now described. The <i>Civitas Dei </i>is beginning
 to be identified with the Church; but Augustine emphasises the uncertainty of
 its true membership owing to the scarcity of the elect. The book thus concludes
 the history on earth:</p>
 <p>'Now it is time to set an end to this book, wherein, as far as need was, we
 have run along with the courses of the two cities in their confused progress,
 the one of which, the Babylon of the earth, has made her false gods of mortal
 men, serving them and sacrificing to them as she thought good; but the other,
 the heavenly Jerusalem, she has stuck to the only and true God, and is his true
 and pure sacrifice herself. But both of these do feel one touch of good and evil
 fortune, but not with one faith, nor one hope, nor one law: and at length at the
 last judgment they shall be severed for ever, and either shall receive the
 endless reward of their works. Of these two ends we are now to discourse.'</p>
 <p>Book XIX proceeds to the discussion with which we began, the thought of the <i>summum
 bonum. </i>Augustine says that this can be found only in the world beyond. After
 admitting that society is integral to human life, he points to some of its
 inevitable miseries on earth<font face="Arial">--</font>war, insecurity<font face="Arial">--</font>and
 becomes eloquenton the value of peace.</p>
 <p>(C 11.) 'We may therefore say that peace is our final good, as we said of
 life eternal. Because the Psalm says unto that city, whereof we write this
 laborious work: "Praise the Lord, O Jerusalem, praise thy Lord, O Sion; for
 He hath made fast the bars of thy gates and blessed thy children within thee; He
 giveth peace in thy borders." When the bars of the gates are fast, as none
 can come in, so none can go out. And therefore this peace which we call final is
 the borders and bounds of this city; for the mystical name hereof, Jerusalem,
 signifies a vision of peace. But because the name of peace is ordinary in this
 world where eternity is not resident, therefore we choose rather to call the
 bound, wherein the chief good of this city lies, "life eternal." . . .
 The good of peace is generally the greatest wish of the world, and the most
 welcome when it comes. Whereof I think one may take leave of our reader, to have
 a word or two more, both because of the city's end, whereof we now speak, and of
 the sweetness of peace, which all men do love.'</p>
 <p>(C. 12.) ' Who will not confess this with me, who marks man's affairs and the
 general form of nature? For joy and peace are desired alike of all men. The
 warrior would but conquer; war's aim is nothing but glorious peace. What is
 victory but a suppression of resistants; which being done, peace follows? So
 that peace is war's purpose, the scope of all military discipline and the limit
 at which all just contentions level. All men seek peace by war, but none seek
 war by peace. For they that perturb the peace they live in, do it not for hate
 of it, but to show their power in alteration of it. They would not disannul it,
 but they would have it as they like; and though they break into seditions from
 the rest, yet must they hold a peaceful force with their fellows that are
 engaged with them, or else they shall never effect what they intend. Even the
 thieves themselves, that molest all the world besides them, are at peace amongst
 themselves. . . .</p>
 <p>'What tiger is there that does not purr over her young ones and fawn upon
 them in her tenderness? What kite is there, though he fly solitarily about for
 his prey, but will seek his female, build his nest, sit his eggs, feed his
 young, and assist his mate in her motherly duty, all that in him lies? Far
 stronger are the bands that bind man unto society, and peace with all that are
 peaceable; the worst men of all do fight for their fellows' quietness and would
 (if it lay in their power) reduce all into a distinct form of state drawn by
 themselves, whereof they would be the heads, which could never be, but by a
 coherence either through fear or love. For herein is perverse pride an imitator
 of the goodness of God having equality of others with itself under Him, and
 laying a yoke of obedience upon its fellows, under itself instead of Him; thus
 hates it the just peace of God, and builds an unjust one for itself. Yet can it
 not but love peace, for no vice however unnatural can pull nature up by the
 roots. . . .'</p>
 <p>(C.<i> </i>13.) ' The body's peace therefore is an orderly disposal of the
 parts thereof; the unreasonable soul's, a good temperature of the appetites
 thereof; the reasonable soul's, a true harmony between the knowledge and the
 performance. That of body and soul alike, a temperate and undiseased habit of
 nature in the whole creature. The peace of mortal man with immortal God is an
 orderly obedience unto his eternal law, performed in faith. Peace of man and man
 is a mutual concord; peace of a family, an orderly rule and subjection amongst
 the parts thereof; peace of a city, an orderly command and obedience amongst the
 citizens; peace of God's City, a most orderly coherence in God and fruition of
 God; peace of all things is a well disposed order. . . .'</p>
 <p>(C. 14.) 'All temporal things are referred unto the benefit of the peace
 which is resident in the terrestrial city, by the members thereof; and unto the
 use of the eternal peace by the citizens of the heavenly society. . . .'</p>
 <p>'Now God, our good Master, teaching us in the two great commandments the love
 of Him, and the love of our neighbour, to love three things, God, our neighbours
 and ourselves, and seeing he that loves God offends not in loving himself--it
 follows that he ought to counsel his neighbours to love God and to provide for
 him in the love of God, sure he is commanded to love him as his own self. So
 must he do for his wife, children, family and all men besides, and wish likewise
 that his neighbour would do as much for him, in his need; thus shall he be
 settled in peace and orderly concord with all the world. The order whereof is,
 first, to do no man hurt, and, secondly, to help all that he can. So that his
 own have the first place in his care and those his place and order in human
 society affords him more conveniency to benefit. Whereupon S. Paul says:
 "He that provideth not for his own and, namely, for them that be of his
 household, denieth the faith and is worse than an infidel." For this is the
 foundation of domestic peace, which is an orderly rule and subjection in the
 parts of the family, wherein the provisors are the commanders, as the husband
 over his wife, parents over their children, and masters over their servants; and
 they that are provided for obey, as the wives do their husbands, children their
 parents, and servants their masters. But in the family of the faithful man, the
 heavenly pilgrim, there the commanders are indeed the servants of those they
 seem to command; ruling not in ambition, but being bound by careful duty; not in
 proud sovereignty but in nourishing pity.'</p>
 <p>(C. 15.) ' Thus has nature's order prevailed and man by God was thus
 created.' But sin ruled all. 'Sin is the mother of servitude and the first cause
 of man's subjection to man.' Dominion in the strict sense existed only between
 man and dumb animals. Yet for all that obedience is our duty; and the family is
 ever a part of the city.</p>
 <p>In Chapter 17 we find the two ends described; one is earthly peace alone, the
 other has its other-worldly reference. Yet this heavenly city has members in all
 earthly cities, gives them true peace and the heavenly hope. Augustine goes on
 discussing (Chapter 21) Cicero's definition of a republic in which justice is an
 integral element. On that hypothesis Rome never was a commonwealth, since
 justice cannot be where the true God is not worshipped. But in Chapter 24 he
 gives another definition under which any stable state can be grouped. No true
 virtue exists apart from God, yet earthly peace is needed and must be used by
 the citizens of the heavenly state.</p>
 <p>Book XX<b> </b>is concerned with the Last Judgment. In Chapter 6 Augustine
 argues that the first resurrection has already taken place in the conversion of
 sinners to Christ. The millennial kingdom is not, as the Chiliasts say, a future
 reign of Christ in the world, but is the present kingdom of the Church. This is
 the binding of the devil. It began with the spread of the Church outside of
 Judaism. The 'thrones and they that sat upon them' are the rulers of the
 Churches. The souls that reign with Christ a thousand years are the martyrs. The
 beast is the society of wicked man, opposed to the company of God's servants and
 fighting against His holy city. This society consists not only of open enemies
 but also of tares among the wheat. More apologetic discussion concludes the
 book.</p>
 <p>Book XXI is concerned with the pains of the lost. We have an interesting
 passage on the miseries of life.</p>
 <p>The last Book XXII gives an account of the felicity of the saved and the
 eternal bliss of the kingdom of God. Here apologetic follows concerning the
 Incarnation and the miraculous, in order to refute contemporary errors. After a
 description of the ills of life comes an eloquent passage on the goods of human
 life. Those passages form an interesting contrast:</p>
 <p>(C. 22.) 'Concerning man's first origin our present life (if such a miserable
 estate can be called a life) does sufficiently prove that all his children were
 condemned in him. What else does that horrid gulf of ignorance confirm, whence
 all error has birth, and wherein all the sons of Adam are so deeply drenched,
 that none can be freed without toil, fear and sorrow? What else does our love of
 vanities affirm, whence there arises such a tempest of cares, sorrows, repinings,
 fears, mad exultations, discords, altercations, wars, treasons, furies, hates,
 deceits, flatteries, thefts, rapines, perjuries, pride, ambition, envy, murder,
 parricide, cruelty, villainy, luxury, impudence, unchastity, fornications,
 adulteries, incests, several sorts of sins against nature (filthy even to be
 named), sacrilege, . . . false witnesses, false judgments, violence, robberies,
 and suchlike, out of my remembrance to reckon, but not excluded from the life of
 man? All these evils are belonging to man and arise out of the root of that
 error and perverse affection which every son of Adam brings into the world with
 him.'</p>
 <p>Augustine points out that the discipline of children has no other meaning.
 'What is the end of all these but to abolish ignorance and to bridle corruption
 both which we come wrapped into the world withal.' He goes on:</p>
 <p>'To omit the pains that enforce children to learn the (scarcely useful) books
 that please their parents, how huge a band of pains attend the firmer state of
 man and be not peculiarly inflicted on the wicked, but generally impendent over
 us all, through our common estate in misery! Who can recount them, who can
 conceive them? What fears, what calamities does the loss of children, of goods
 or of credit, the false dealing of others, false suspicion, open violence and
 all other mischiefs inflicted by others, heap upon the heart of man? Being
 generally accompanied with poverty, imprisonment, bands, punishments, tortures,
 loss of limbs or senses, prostitution to beastly lust, and other such horrid
 events? So are we afflicted on the other side with chances <i>ab externo, </i>with
 cold, heat, storms, showers, deluges, lightnings, thunder, earthquakes, falls of
 houses, fury of beasts, poisons of airs, waters, plants and beasts of a thousand
 sorts, stinging of serpents, biting of mad dogs, a strange accident wherein a
 beast most sociable and familiar with man shall sometimes become more to be
 feared than a lion or a dragon, infecting him whom he bites with such a furious
 madness, that he is to be feared by his family worse than any wild beast. What
 misery do navigators now and then endure? Or travellers by land? What man can
 walk anywhere free from sudden accidents? One coming home from the court (being
 sound enough on his feet) fell down, broke his leg and died of it; who would
 have thought this that had seen him sitting in the court? Eli, the priest, fell<i>
 </i>from his chair where he sat, and broke his neck. What fears are husbandmen,
 yea all men, subject unto, that the fruits should be hurt by the heavens or
 earth or caterpillars or locusts or such pernicious things! Yet when they have
 gathered them and laid them up they are secured. Notwithstanding I have known
 granaries full of corn borne quite away with an inundation.'</p>
 <p>And so forth.</p>
 <p>Augustine's tone may seem gloomy. But it must be borne in mind that the times
 were not bright. The reason of this book was the breaking up of the long
 centuries of Roman prosperity. As it neared its end, the storm burst even in
 Africa. Augustine's life was passed in a series of changes like those which
 divide the jubilees of Queen Victoria from the silver wedding of her grandson.
 It may indeed be argued that the habitual assumptions of Western civilisation
 both in Europe and America have been too optimistic ; that they assume peace and
 progress as natural and inevitable, and that the advance of physical science led
 to an altogether too favourable view of the reduction of pain in human life in a
 state of things rarely realised in history. It may be thought that the temper of
 Augustine, of the Middle Ages, and of the present, is more truly universal than
 that of the protected Roman Empire, of China, or of the Victorians. Anyhow we
 can parallel S. Augustine from writers in many ages, not only the Book of Job,
 but Richard Baxter, the author of a book curiously suggestive of the 'De
 Civitate Dei'--'The Saints' Everlasting Rest.' In that incomparable style of
 the seventeenth century he declares:</p>
 <p>(VII, 12.) 'Oh, the hourly dangers that we poor sinners here below walk in!
 Every sense is a snare, every member a snare, every creature a snare, every
 mercy a snare, and every duty a snare to us. We can scarce open our eyes but we
 are in danger; if we behold those above us, we are in danger of envy; if those
 below us, we are in danger of contempt; if we see sumptuous buildings, pleasant
 habitations, honour and riches, we are in danger to be drawn away with covetous
 desires; if the rags and beggary of others, we are in danger of self-applauding
 thoughts and unmercifulness. If we see beauty it is a bait to lust; if
 deformity, to loathing and disdain.'</p>
 <p>(VII, 15.) 'The Church on earth is a mere hospital; which way ever we go we
 hear complaining; and into what corner soever we cast our eyes we behold objects
 of pity and grief; some groaning under a dark understanding, some under a
 senseless heart, some languishing under unfruitful weakness, and some bleeding
 for miscarriages and wilfulness, and some in such a lethargy that they are past
 complaining; some crying out of their pining poverty; some groaning under pains
 and infirmities; and some bewailing a whole catalogue of calamities, especially
 in days of common sufferings when nothing appears to our sight but ruin;
 families ruined; congregations ruined; sumptuous structures ruined; cities
 ruined; country ruined; court ruined; kingdom ruined; who weeps not, when all
 these bleed?'</p>
 <p>(VII, 16.) 'Oh, the dying life that we now live; as full of suffering as of
 days and hours! We are the carcasses that all calamities prey upon; as various
 as they are, each one will have a snatch at us, and be sure to devour a morsel
 of our comfort. . . . As all our senses are the inlets of sin, so they are
 become the inlets of our sorrow. Grief creeps in at our eyes, at our ears, and
 almost everywhere; it seizes upon our heads, our hearts, our flesh, our spirits,
 and what part doth escape it? Fears do devour us and darken our delights, as the
 frosts do nip the tender buds: cares do consume us and feed upon our spirits, as
 the scorching sun doth wither the delicate flowers. Or, if any saint or stoic
 have fortified his inwards against these, yet is he naked still without; and if
 he be wiser than to create his own sorrows, yet shall he be sure to feel his
 share, he shall produce them as the meritorious, if not as the efficient, cause.
 What tender pieces are these dusty bodies! What brittle glasses do we bear about
 us; and how many thousand dangers are they hurried through; and how hardly
 cured, if once cracked! Oh, the multitudes of slender veins, of tender
 membranes, nerves, fibres, muscles, arteries, and all subject to obstruc-tions,
 exesions, tensions, contractions, resolutions, every one a fit subject for pain
 and fit to communicate that pain to the whole; what noble part is there that
 suffereth its pain or ruin alone?'</p>
 <p>But Augustine does not stop at this. The Puritan ideal with its extreme of
 otherworldliness could see little good in the natural and relative. Not so
 Augustine. In Chapter 24 he almost outdoes his previously cited passage in his
 anxiety to show the reality of earthly goods--goods distinct from the life of
 grace.</p>
 <p>'Besides the disciplines of good behaviour and the ways to eternal happiness
 (which are called virtues), and besides the grace of God which is in Jesus
 Christ, imparted only to the sons of the promise, man's invention has brought
 forth so many and such rare sciences and arts (partly necessary and partly
 voluntary), that the excellency of his capacity makes the rare goodness of his
 creation apparent, even then when he goes about things that are either
 superfluous or pernicious, and shows from what an excellent gift he has those
 his inventions and practices. What variety has man found out in buildings,
 attires, husbandry, navigations, sculpture, and imagery! What perfection has he
 shown in the shows of theatres, in taming, killing and catching wild beasts!
 What millions of inventions has he against others and for himself in poisons,
 arms, engines, stratagems and suchlike! What thousands of medicines for the
 health, of meats for the throat, of means and figures to persuade, of eloquent
 phrases to delight, of verses for pleasure, of musical inventions and
 instruments! How excellent inventions are geography, arithmetic, astrology and
 the rest! How large is the capacity of man, if we should stand upon particulars!
 Lastly, how cunningly and with what exquisite wit have the philosophers and the
 heretics defended their very errors, it is strange to imagine. For here we speak
 of the nature of man's soul in general, as man is mortal, without any reference
 to the way of truth whereby he comes to the life eternal.'</p>
 <p>After dilating on the marvels of the human body, he goes on to natural
 beauty.</p>
 <p>'And then for the beauty and use of other creatures, which God has set before
 the eyes of man (though as yet miserable and amongst miseries), what man is
 liable to recount them? The universal gracefulness of the heavens, the earth and
 the sea, the brightness of the light in the sun, moon and stars, the shades of
 the woods, the colours and smells of flowers, the numbers of birds and their
 varied hues and songs, the many forms of beasts and fishes whereof the least are
 the rarest (for the fabric of the bee or the ant is more to be wondered at than
 the whales), and the strange alterations in the colour of the sea (as being in
 several garments), now one green, then another, now blue, then purple? How
 pleasing a sight sometimes it is to see it rough, and how more pleasing when it
 is calm! And O what a hand is that, that gives so many meats to assuage hunger!
 So many tastes to those meats (without help of cook), and so many medicinal
 powers to those tastes! How delightful is the interchange of day and night! the
 temperateness of air and the works of nature in the barks of trees and skins of
 beasts! Oh, who can draw the particulars? How tedious should I be in every
 peculiar of these few that I have here as it were heaped together, if I should
 stay upon them one by one! Yet are all these but solaces of men's miseries, no
 way pertinent to his glories.</p>
 <p>'What then are they that his bliss shall give him, if that his misery has
 such blessings as these? What will God give them whom He has predestinated unto
 life, having given such great things even to them whom He has predestinated unto
 death? What will He give them in His kingdom, for whom He sent His only Son to
 suffer all injuries even unto death upon earth? Whereupon S. Paul says unto
 them: "He who spared not His own Son, but gave Him for us all unto death,
 how shall He not with Him give us all things also?" When this promise is
 fulfilled, O what shall we be then? How glorious shall the soul of man be
 without all stain and sin, that can either subdue or oppose it, or against which
 it need to contend: perfect in all virtue and enthroned in all perfection of
 peace!</p>
 <p>How great, how delightful, how true shall our knowledge of all things be
 there, without all error, without all labour, where we shall drink at the
 spring-head of God's aspience, without all difficulty and in all felicity! How
 perfect shall our bodies be, being wholly subject unto their spirits, and
 thereby sufficiently quickened and nourished without any other sustenance, for
 they shall now be no more natural, but spiritual; they shall have the substance
 of flesh quite exempt from all fleshly corruption.'</p>
 <p>In Chapter 25 he points out that 'as touching the good things of the mind
 which the blessed shall enjoy after this life, the philosophers and we are both
 of one mind. Our difference is concerning the resurrection,' which he proceeds
 to argue. Of Porphyry, who has on the whole his deepest reverence, of Plato and
 Varro, Augustine speaks here, as always, in terms of honour, almost love. In the
 last chapter he enlarges on the <i>visio pads </i>and the eternal felicity of
 the city of God. It is interesting as well as eloquent, for it brings out the
 human and non-abstract quality of Augustine's theology:</p>
 <p>(C. 35.) 'How great shall that felicity be, where there shall be no evil
 thing, where no good thing shall lie hidden; there we shall have leisure to
 utter forth the praises of God, which shall be all things in all! For what other
 thing is done, where we shall not rest with any slothfulness, nor labour for any
 want, I know not. . . . What the motions of those bodies shall be there I dare
 not rashly define, when I am not able to dive into the depth of that mystery.
 Nevertheless both the motion and the state, as the form of them, shall be comely
 and decent, whatsoever it shall be, where there shall be nothing which shall not
 be comely. Truly, where the spirit will, there forthwith shall the body be;
 neither will the spirit will anything, which may not beseem the body nor the
 spirit. There shall be true glory, where no man shall be praised for error or
 flattery. . . . There is true peace, where no man suffers anything which may
 molest him, either from himself or from any other. He himself shall be the
 reward of virtue, which has given virtue, and has promised Himself unto him,
 than whom nothing can be better and greater. For what other thing is that which
 He has said by the Prophet: "I will be their God and they shall be My
 people": but I will be whereby they shall be satisfied. I will be
 whatsoever is lawfully desired of men, life, health, food, abundance, glory,
 honour, peace and all good things? For so also is that rightly understood which
 the Apostle says: "That God may be all in all." He shall be the end of
 our desires, who shall be seen without end, who shall be loved without any
 satiety and praised without any tediousness. . . . There we shall rest and see,
 we shall see and love, we shall love, and we shall praise. Behold what shall be
 in the end without end? For what other thing is our end but to come to that
 kingdom of which there is no end?</p>
 <p>'I think I have discharged the debt of this great work by the help of God.
 Let them which think I have done too little and them which think I have done too
 much, grant me a favourable pardon. But let them not think I have performed
 enough, accepting it with a kind congratulation; give no thanks unto me but
 "unto the Lord with me." Amen.'</p>
 <p>This brief outline makes this much clear. The 'De Civitate Dei' is apologetic
 and theological. It is not a treatise on polity, whether ecclesiastical or
 civil. All S. Augustine's philosophical reading has left traces-- and every
 kind of dialectic is displayed. As apologetic it is more effective against
 paganism than against the Platonists. Too much is assumed in regard to Jewish
 and Christian history. The book might reassure those within the Church whose
 faith was shaken. It would hardly arrest those without. It has the interest and
 also the coruscating irrelevance that comes from a great variety of topics. The
 thread is there, but sometimes it is hard to disentangle. Compare this book with
 such a work of apology as that of Origen against Celsus. We note how much larger
 the Church looms in the view of S. Augustine. It is no set of propositions which
 he is defending in a dialectic debate with other philosophers; although he can
 do this and does it in detail. But it is a social life which he sets up against
 another form of social life. The treatment is less individualist than that of
 Origen--though the latter had to follow the course taken by Celsus. First we
 may observe that what impressed Augustine was the witness of the vastness of the
 Church and its triumph. As he says in a sermon:</p>
 <p>'What do we see which they saw not? The Church throughout all nations. What
 do we not see which they saw? Christ present in the flesh. As they saw Him and
 believed concerning the Body, so do we see the Body; let us believe concerning
 the Head. Let what we have respectively seen help us. The sight of Christ helped
 them to believe the future Church; the sight of the Church helps us to believe
 that Christ has risen. Their faith was made complete, and ours is made complete
 also. Their faith was made complete by the sight of the Head, ours is made
 complete from the sight of the Body.' (<i>Sermon </i>lxvi. (cxi.) § 6.)</p>
 <p>Probably those are right who say that in this respect also--if in nothing
 else--Augustine is epoch-making, that all his apologetic rests on the idea of
 Church. This characteristic would be developed in the Donatist controversy. It
 must be admitted, however, that such a view of him is not universally held, and
 some would put the distinctive basis of S. Augustine in the idea not of the
 Church, but of grace.[<a name="text04" href="#footnote04">4</a>]</p>
 <p>Secondly we note the aggressive tone of the book. Despite his references to
 Plato and his real debt to Plotinus and Porphyry, Augustine is far more
 intransigent than Clement of Alexandria, who would treat Christianity as but the
 coping-stone of Greek thought. It is not as a superior gnosis, but it is as a
 scheme of Redemption, that Augustine commends Christianity, and values it for
 himself. The cause of this lies partly in that doctrine of original sin which
 was so strongly held by Augustine, and even was in some degree being developed
 while this book was in process. It is the point of the whole book.</p>
 <p>Another note is the stress laid on the ethical difference between
 Christianity and its competitors--though that is not a novel feature. Augustine
 knows that it is not speculative truth but conduct that shows the greatest
 difference. Also he is aware that he is dealing with a dying interest. Paganism
 was uttering its death-cry (for the time). Clear is his note of triumph in the
 conquering and universal power of the Church.</p>
 <p>History including miracle plays a great part. The destruction of Jerusalem
 following the rejection of Jesus by the Jews is an emphatic evidence of the
 Gospel. The argument from miracles he states as many would state it now. A
 miracle is not contrary to nature but to what we know of nature. The argument
 depends on our conception of God. Augustine had no notion of the distinction
 between the natural--<i>i.e. </i>the physical --and the supernatural. Nature
 means the whole world of God's order--all that happens. The problem is whether
 God's Will be paramount. All this has been treated by Mr. Lacey in his earliest
 Pringle-Stewart Lectures, 'Nature, Miracle and Sin.'</p>
 <p>Above all we must bear in mind that the whole course of created existence is
 seen by S. Augustine as a conflict between two societies. However little some
 may make use of the figure of <i>Civitas Dei, </i>they have no right to deny its
 implications as against a doctrine purely individualist. Sin in Adam has become
 the property of the race, it is needful to show redemption in the order of
 historical development. The apologetic rests on a philosophy of history.</p>
 <p>Finally it is of and in the antique world that Augustine wrote. The notion of
 him as medieval in temperament may have some evidence, yet it must be understood
 with care. The atmosphere of the book is of the old world. It is before Gelasius
 with his doctrine of the two powers, before Justinian. Only a little over a
 century had passed since Diocletian's effort at exterminating the Church. Less
 than that divided S. Augustine from the reaction under Julian.</p>
