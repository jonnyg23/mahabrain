 An Appeal to the Evangelical Congregations and Christians in
 Germany</strong></font></h2>
 
 <p><a name="01"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.01</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> The Confessional Synod of the German
 Evangelical Church met in Barmen, May 29-31, 1934. Here
 representatives from all the German Confessional Churches met
 with one accord in a confession of the one Lord of the one, holy,
 apostolic Church. In fidelity to their Confession of Faith,
 members of Lutheran, Reformed, and United Churches sought a
 common message for the need and temptation of the Church in our
 day. With gratitude to God they are convinced that they have been
 given a common word to utter. It was not their intention to found
 a new Church or to form a union. For nothing was farther from
 their minds than the abolition of the confessional status of our
 Churches. Their intention was, rather, to withstand in faith and
 unanimity the destruction of the Confession of Faith, and thus of
 the Evangelical Church in Germany. In opposition to attempts to
 establish the unity of the German Evangelical Church by means of
 false doctrine, by the use of force and insincere practices, the
 Confessional Synod insists that the unity of the Evangelical
 Churches in Germany can come only from the Word of God in faith
 through the Holy Spirit. Thus alone is the Church renewed.<br>
 </strong></font><a name="02"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.02</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> Therefore the Confessional Synod calls upon
 the congregations to range themselves behind it in prayer, and
 steadfastly to gather around those pastors and teachers who are
 loyal to the Confessions.<br>
 </strong></font><a name="03"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.03</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> Be not deceived by loose talk, as if we
 meant to oppose the unity of the German nation! Do not listen to
 the seducers who pervert our intentions, as if we wanted to break
 up the unity of the German Evangelical Church or to forsake the
 Confessions of the Fathers!<br>
 </strong></font><a name="04"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.04</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> Try the spirits whether they are of God!
 Prove also the words of the Confessional Synod of the German
 Evangelical Church to see whether they agree with Holy Scripture
 and with the Confessions of the Fathers. If you find that we are
 speaking contrary to Scripture, then do not listen to us! But if
 you find that we are taking our stand upon Scripture, then let no
 fear or temptation keep you from treading with us the path of
 faith and obedience to the Word of God, in order that God's
 people be of one mind upon earth and that we in faith experience
 what he himself has said: "I will never leave you, nor
 forsake you." Therefore, "Fear not, little flock, for
 it is your Father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom." </strong></font></p>

 its constitution of July 11, 1933, the German Evangelical Church
 is a federation of Confessional Churches that grew our of the
 Reformation and that enjoy equal rights. The theological basis
 for the unification of these Churches is laid down in Article 1
 and Article 2(1) of the constitution of the German Evangelical
 Church that was recognized by the Reich Government on July 14,
 1933:</strong></font></p>
 
 <ul>
     <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Article 1. The inviolable
         foundation of the German Evangelical Church is the gospel
         of Jesus Christ as it is attested for us in Holy
         Scripture and brought to light again in the Confessions
         of the Reformation. The full powers that the Church needs
         for its mission are hereby determined and limited.</strong></font></li>
     <li><font face="Arial"><strong>Article 2 (1). The German
         Evangelical Church is divided into member Churches </strong><strong><i>Landeskirchen).</i></strong></font></li>

 Reformed, and United Churches, of free synods, Church assemblies,
 and parish organizations united in the Confessional Synod of the
 German Evangelical Church, declare that we stand together on the
 ground of the German Evangelical Church as a federation of German
 Confessional Churches. We are bound together by the confession of
 the one Lord of the one, holy, catholic, and apostolic Church.<br>
 </strong></font><a name="07"><font face="Arial"><strong></strong></font></a><font color="#800000" face="Arial"><strong>8.07</strong></font><font face="Arial"><strong> We publicly declare before all evangelical
 Churches in Germany that what they hold in common in this
 Confession is grievously imperiled, and with it the unity of the
 German Evangelical Church. It is threatened by the teaching
 methods and actions of the ruling Church party of the
 "German Christians" and of the Church administration
 carried on by them. These have become more and more apparent
 during the first year of the existence of the German Evangelical
 Church. This threat consists in the fact that the theological
 basis, in which the German Evangelical Church is united, has been
 continually and systematically thwarted and rendered ineffective
 by alien principles, on the part of the leaders and spokesmen of
 the "German Christians" as well as on the part of the
 Church administration. When these principles are held to be
 valid, then, according to all the Confessions in force among us,
 the Church ceases to be the Church and th German Evangelical
 Church, as a federation of Confessional Churches, becomes
 intrinsically impossible.<br>

 today. Precisely because we want to be and to remain faithful to

 that we have been given a common message to utter in a time of
 common need and temptation. We commend to God what this may mean
 for the intrrelations of the Confessional Churches.<br>

 by means of the threat and exercise of force, according to the
 measure of human judgment and human ability. The Church
 acknowledges the benefit of this divine appointment in gratitude

 God's commandment and righteousness, and thereby the
 responsibility both of rulers and of the ruled. It trusts and
