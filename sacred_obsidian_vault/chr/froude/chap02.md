 <h2 align="CENTER"><span style="font-weight: 400">CONVICTION OF SIN. </span>
 </h2>
 <i>THE Pilgrim's Progress </i>is the history of the struggle of human nature to 
 overcome temptation and shake off the bondage of sin, under the convictions which 
 prevailed among serious men in England in the seventeenth century. The allegory 
 is the life of its author cast in an imaginative form. Every step in Christian's 
 journey had been first trodden by Bunyan himself; every pang of fear and shame, 
 every spasm of despair, every breath of hope and consolation, which is there described, 
 is but a reflexion as on a mirror from personal experience. It has spoken to the 
 hearts of all later generations of Englishmen because it came from the heart; because 
 it is the true record of the genuine emotions of a human soul; and to such a record 
 the emotions of other men will respond, as one stringed instrument vibrates responsively 
 to another. The poet's power lies in creating sympathy; but he cannot, however richly 
 gifted, stir feelings which he has not himself known in all their intensity.

 <p align="left">The religious history of man is essentially the same in all ages. 
 It takes its rise in the duality of his nature. He is an animal, and as an animal 
 he desires bodily pleasure and shrinks from bodily pain. As a being capable of morality, 
 he is conscious that for him there exists a right and wrong. Something, whatever 
 that something may be, binds him to choose one and avoid the other. This is his 
 religion, his religatio, his obligation, in the sense in which the Romans, from 
 whom we take it, used the word; and obligation implies some superior power to which 
 man owes obedience. The conflict between his two dispositions agitates his heart 
 and perplexes his intellect. To do what the superior power requires of him, he must 
 thwart his inclinations. He dreads punishment, if he neglects to do it. He invents 
 methods by which he can indulge his appetites, and finds a substitute by which he 
 can propitiate his invisible ruler or rulers. He offers sacrifices; he institutes 
 ceremonies and observances. This is the religion of the body, the religion of fear. 
 It is what we call superstition. In his nobler moods he feels that this is but to 
 evade the difficulty. He perceives that the sacrifice required is the sacrifice 
 of himself. It is not the penalty for sin which he must fear, but the sin itself. 
 He must conquer his own lower nature. He must detach his heart from his pleasures, 
 and he must love good for its own sake, and because it is his only real good; and 
 this is spiritual religion or piety. Between these two forms of worship of the unseen, 
 the human race has swayed to and fro from the first moment in which they learnt 
 to discern between good and evil. Superstition attracts, because it is indulgent 
 to immorality by providing means by which God can be pacified. But it carries its 
 antidote along with it, for it keeps alive the sense of God's existence; and when 
 it has produced its natural effects, when the believer rests in his observances 
 and lives practically as if there was no God at all, the conscience again awakes. 
 Sacrifices and ceremonies become detested as idolatry, and religion becomes conviction 
 of sin, a fiery determination to fight with the whole soul against appetite, vanity, 
 self-seeking, and every mean propensity which the most sensitive alarm can detect. 
 The battle unhappily is attended with many vicissitudes. The victory, though practically 
 it may be won, is never wholly won. The struggle brings with it every variety of 
 emotion, alternations of humility and confidence, despondency and hope. The essence 
 of it is always the same--the effort of the higher nature to overcome the lower. 
 The form of it varies from period to period, according to the conditions of the 
 time, the temperament of different people, the conception of the character of the 
 Supreme Power, which the state of knowledge enables men to form. It will be found 
 even when the puzzled intellect can see no light in Heaven at all, in the stern 
 and silent fulfilment of moral duty. It will appear as enthusiasm; it will appear 
 as asceticism; it will appear wherever there is courage to sacrifice personal enjoyment 
 for a cause believed to be holy. We must all live. We must all, as we suppose, in 
 one shape or other, give account for our actions; and accounts of the conflict are 
 most individually interesting when it is an open wrestle with the enemy; as we find 
 in the penances and austerities of the Catholic saints, or when the difficulties 
 of belief are confessed and detailed, as in David's Psalms, or in the Epistles of 
 St. Paul. St. Paul, like the rest of mankind, found a law in his members warring 
 against the law which was in his heart. The problem presented to him was how one 
 was to be brought into subjection to the other, and the solution was by "the putting 
 on of Christ." St. Paul's mind was charged with the ideas of Oriental and Greek 
 philosophy then prevalent in the Roman Empire. His hearers understood him, because 
 he spoke in the language of the prevailing speculations. We who have not the clue 
 cannot, perhaps, perfectly understand him; but his words have been variously interpreted 
 as human intelligence has expanded, and have formed the basis of the two great theologies 
 which have been developed out of Christianity. The Christian religion taught that 
 evil could not be overcome by natural human strength. The Son of God had come miraculously 
 upon earth, had lived a life of stainless purity, and had been offered as a sacrifice 
 to redeem men conditionally from the power of sin. The conditions, as English Protestant 
 theology understands them, are nowhere more completely represented than in <i>The 
 Pilgrim's Progress. </i>The Catholic theology, rising as it did in the two centuries 
 immediately following St. Paul, approached, probably, nearer to what he really intended 
 to say. </p>
 <p align="left">Catholic theology, as a system, is a development of Platonism. The 
 Platonists had discovered that the seat of moral evil was material substance. In 
 matter, and therefore in the human body, there was either some inherent imperfection, 
 or some ingrained perversity and antagonism to good. The soul, so long as it was 
 attached to the body, was necessarily infected by it; and as human life on earth 
 consisted in the connection of soul and body, every single man was necessarily subject 
 to infirmity Catholic theology accepted the position and formulated an escape from 
 it. The evil in matter was a fact. It was explained by Adam's sin. But there it 
 was. The taint was inherited by all Adam's posterity. The flesh of man was incurably 
 vitiated, and if he was to be saved, a new body must be prepared for him. This Christ 
 had done. </p>
 <p align="left">That Christ's body was not as other men's bodies was proved after 
 his resurrection, when it showed itself independent of the limitations of extended 
 substance. In virtue of these mysterious properties, it became the body of the Corporate 
 Church, into which believers were admitted by baptism. The natural body was not 
 at once destroyed, but a new element was introduced into it, by the power of which, 
 assisted by penance, and mortification, and the spiritual food of the Eucharist, 
 the grosser qualities were gradually subdued, and the corporeal system was changed. 
 Then body and spirit became alike pure together, and the saint became capable of 
 obedience, so perfect as not only to suffice for himself, but to supply the wants 
 of others. The corruptible put on incorruption. The bodies of the saints worked 
 miracles, and their flesh was found unaffected by decay after hundreds of years.
 </p>
 <p align="left">This belief, so long as it was sincerely held, issued naturally 
 in characters of extreme beauty--of beauty so great as almost to demonstrate its 
 truth. The purpose of it, so far as it affected action, was self-conquest. Those 
 who try with their whole souls to conquer themselves find the effort lightened by 
 a conviction that they are receiving supernatural assistance; and the form in which 
 the Catholic theory supposed the assistance to be given was at least perfectly innocent. 
 But it is in the nature of human speculations, though they may have been entertained 
 at first in entire good faith, to break down under trial, if they are not in conformity 
 with fact. Catholic theology furnished Europe with a rule of faith and action which 
 lasted 1500 years. For the last three centuries of that period it was changing from 
 a religion into a superstition, till, from being the world's guide, it became its 
 scandal. "The body of Christ" had become a kingdom of this world, insulting its 
 subjects by the effrontery of its ministers, the insolence of its pretensions, the 
 mountains of lies which it was teaching as sacred truths. Luther spoke; and over 
 half the Western world the Catholic Church collapsed, and a new theory and Christianity 
 had to be constructed out of the fragments of it. </p>
 <p align="left">There was left behind a fixed belief in God and in the Bible as 
 His revealed word, in a future judgment, in the fall of man, in the atonement made 
 for sin by the death of Christ, and in the new life which was made possible by His 
 resurrection. The change was in the conception of the method by which the atonement 
 was imagined to be efficacious. The material or sacramental view of it, though it 
 lingered inconsistently in the mind even of Luther himself, was substantially gone. 
 New ideas adopted in enthusiasm are necessarily extreme. The wrath of God was held 
 to be inseparably and eternally attached to every act of sin, however infirm the 
 sinner. That his nature could be changed, and that he could be mystically strengthened 
 by incorporation with Christ's body in the Church, was contrary to experience, and 
 was no longer credible. The conscience of every man, in the Church or out of it, 
 told him that he was daily and hourly offending. God's law demanded a life of perfect 
 obedience, eternal death being the penalty of the lightest breach of it. No human 
 being was capable of such perfect obedience. He could not do one single act which 
 would endure so strict a scrutiny. All mankind were thus included under sin. The 
 Catholic Purgatory was swept away. It had degenerated into a contrivance for feeding 
 the priests with money, and it implied that human nature could in itself be renovated 
 by its own sufferings. Thus nothing lay before the whole race except everlasting 
 reprobation. But the door of hope had been opened on the cross of Christ. Christ 
 had done what man could never do. He had fulfilled the law perfectly. God was ready 
 to accept Christ's perfect righteousness as a substitute for the righteousness which 
 man was required to present to him, but could not. The conditions of acceptance 
 were no longer sacraments or outward acts, or lame and impotent efforts after a 
 moral life, but faith in what Christ had done; a complete self-abnegation, a resigned 
 consciousness of utter unworthiness, and an unreserved acceptance of the mercy held 
 out through the Atonement. It might have been thought that since man was born so 
 weak that it was impossible for him to do what the law required, consideration would 
 be had for his infirmity; that it was even dangerous to attribute to the Almighty 
 a character so arbitrary as that He would exact an account from his creatures which 
 the creature's necessary inadequacy rendered him incapable of meeting. But the impetuosity 
 of the new theology would listen to no such excuses. God was infinitely pure, and 
 nothing impure could stand in his sight. Man, so long as he rested on merit of his 
 own, must be for ever excluded from his presence. He must accept grace on the terms 
 on which it was held out to him; then, and then only, God would extend his pity 
 to him. He was no longer a child of wrath: he was God's child. His infirmities remained, 
 but they were constantly obliterated by the merits of Christ. And he had strength 
 given to him, partially, at least, to overcome temptation, under which, but for 
 that strength, he would have fallen. Though nothing which he could do could deserve 
 reward, yet he received grace in proportion to the firmness of his belief; and his 
 efforts after obedience, imperfect though they might be, were accepted for Christ's 
 sake. A good life, or a constant effort after a good life, was still the object 
 which a man was bound to labour after. Though giving no claim to pardon, still less 
 for reward, it was the necessary fruit of a sense of what Christ had done, and of 
 love and gratitude towards him. Good works were the test of saving faith; and if 
 there were no signs of them, the faith was barren: it was not real faith at all.
 </p>
 <p align="left">This was the Puritan belief in England in the seventeenth century. 
 The reason starts at it, but all religion is paradoxical to reason. God hates sin, 
 yet sin exists. He is omnipotent, yet evil is not overcome. The will of man is free, 
 or there can be no guilt; yet the action of the will, so far as experience can throw 
 light on its operation, is as much determined by antecedent causes as every other 
 natural force. Prayer is addressed to a Being assumed to be omniscient; who knows 
 better what is good for us than we can know; who sees our thoughts without requiring 
 to hear them in words; whose will is fixed and cannot be changed. Prayer, therefore, 
 in the eye of reason, is an impertinence. The Puritan theology is not more open 
 to objection on the ground of unreasonableness than the Catholic theology, or any 
 other which regards man as answerable to God for his conduct. We must judge of a 
 creed by its effects on character, as we judge of the wholesomeness of food as it 
 conduces to bodily health. And the creed which swept like a wave through England 
 at that time, and recommended itself to the noblest and most powerful intellects, 
 produced also in those who accepted it a horror of sin, an enthusiasm for justice, 
 purity, and manliness, which can be paralleled only in the first age of Christianity. 
 Certainly there never was such a theory to take man's conceit out of him. He was 
 a miserable wretch, so worthless at his best as to deserve everlasting perdition. 
 If he was to be saved at all, he could be saved only by the unmerited grace of God. 
 In himself he was a child of the devil; and hell, not in metaphor, but in hard and 
 palpable fact, inevitably waited for him. This belief, or the affectation of this 
 belief, continues to be professed, but without a realisation of its tremendous meaning. 
 The form of words is repeated by multitudes who do not care to think what they are 
 saying. Who can measure the effect of such a conviction upon men who were in earnest 
 about their souls, who were assured that this account of their situation was actually 
 true, and on whom, therefore, it bore with increasing weight in proportion to their 
 sincerity? </p>
 <p align="left">With these few prefatory words, I now return to Bun-yan. He had 
 begun to go regularly to church, and by church he meant the Church of England. The 
 change in the constitution of it, even when it came, did not much alter its practical 
 character in the country districts. At El-stow, as we have seen, there was still 
 a high place; then was still a liturgy; there was still a surplice. The Church of 
 England is a compromise between the old theology and the new. The Bishops have the 
 apostolical succession, but many of them disbelieve that they derive any virtue 
 from it. The clergyman is either a priest who can absolve men from sins, or he is 
 a minister, as in other Protestant communions. The sacraments are either means of 
 grace or mere outward signs. A Christian is either saved by baptism or saved by 
 faith, as he pleases to believe. In either case he may be a member of the Church 
 of England. The effect of such uncertain utterances is to leave an impression that, 
 in defining such points closely, theologians are laying down lines of doctrines 
 about subjects of which they know nothing, that the real truth of religion lies 
 in what is common to the two theories, the obligation to lead a moral life; and 
 to this sensible view of their functions the bishops and clergy had, in fact, gradually 
 arrived in the last century, when the revival of what is called earnestness, first 
 in the form of Evangelicalism, and then of Anglo-Catholicism, awoke again the old 
 controversies. </p>
 <p align="left">To a man of fervid temperament suddenly convinced of sin, incapable 
 of being satisfied with ambiguous answers to questions which mean life or death 
 to him, the Church of England has little to say. If he is quiet and reasonable, 
 he finds in it all that he desires. Enthusiastic ages and enthusiastical temperaments 
 demand something more complete and consistent. The clergy under the Long Parliament 
 caught partially the tone of the prevailing spirit. The reading of the <i>Book of 
 Sports </i>had been interdicted, and from their pulpits they lectured their congregations 
 on the ungodliness of the Sabbath amusements. But the congregations were slow to 
 listen, and the sports went on. </p>
 <p align="left">One Sunday morning, when Bunyan was at church with his wife, a sermon 
 was delivered on this subject. It seemed to be especially addressed to himself, 
 and it much affected him. He shook off the impression, and after dinner he went 
 as usual to the green. He was on the point of striking at a ball when the thought 
 rushed across his mind, Wilt thou leave thy sins and go to heaven, or have thy sins 
 and go to hell? He looked up. The reflection of his own emotion was before him in 
 visible form He imagined that he saw Christ himself looking down at him from the 
 sky. But he concluded that it was too late for him to repent. He was past pardon. 
 He was sure to be damned, and he might as well be damned for many sins as for few. 
 Sin, at all events, was pleasant, the only pleasant thing that he knew; therefore 
 he would take his fill of it. The sin was the game, and nothing but the game. He 
 continued to play, but the Puritan sensitiveness had taken hold of him. An artificial 
 offence had become a real offence when his conscience was wounded by it. He was 
 reckless and desperate. </p>
 <p align="left">"This temptation of the devil," he says, "is more usual among poor 
 creatures than many are aware of. It continued with me about a month or more; but 
 one day, as I was standing at a neighbour's shop-window, and there cursing and swearing 
 after my wonted manner, there sat within the woman of the house and heard me, who, 
 though she was a loose and ungodly wretch, protested that I swore and cursed at 
 such a rate that she trembled to hear me. I was able to spoil all the youths in 
 a whole town. At this reproof I was silenced and put to secret shame, and that too, 
 as I thought, before the God of heaven. I stood hanging down my head, and wishing 
 that I might be a little child, that my father might learn me to speak without this 
 wicked sin of swearing; for, thought I, I am so accustomed to it that it is vain 
 to think of a reformation." </p>
 <p align="left">These words have been sometimes taken as a reflection on Bunyan's 
 own father, as if he had not sufficiently checked the first symptoms of a bad habit. 
 If this was so, too much may be easily made of it. The language in the homes of 
 ignorant workmen is seldom select. They have not a large vocabulary, and the words 
 which they use do not mean what they seem to mean. But so sharp and sudden remorse 
 speaks remarkably for Bunyan himself. At this time he could have been barely twenty 
 years old, and already he was quick to see when he was doing wrong, to be sorry 
 for it, and to wish that he could do better. Vain the effort seemed to him, yet 
 from that moment "he did leave off swearing, to his own great wonder;" and he found 
 "that he could speak better and more pleasantly than he did before." </p>
 <p align="left">It lies in the nature of human advance on the road of improvement, 
 that, whatever be a man's occupation, be it handicraft, or art, or knowledge, or 
 moral conquest of self, at each forward step which he takes he grows more conscious 
 of his shortcomings. It is thus with his whole career, and those who rise highest 
 are least satisfied with themselves. Very simply Bunyan tells the story of his progress. 
 On his outward history, on his business and his fortunes with it, he is totally 
 silent. Worldly interests were not worth mentioning. He is solely occupied with 
 his rescue from spiritual perdition. Soon after he had profited by the woman's rebuke, 
 he fell in "with a poor man that made profession of religion and talked pleasantly 
 of the Scriptures." Earnestness in such matters was growing common among English 
 labourers. Under his new friend's example, Bunyan "betook him to the Bible, and 
 began to take great pleasure in reading it," but especially, as he admits frankly 
 (and most people's experience will have been the same), "the historical part; for 
 as for St. Paul's Epistles and Scriptures of that nature, he could not away with 
 them, being as yet ignorant of the corruption of his nature, or of the want and 
 worth of Jesus Christ to save him." </p>
 <p align="left">Not as yet understanding these mysteries, he set himself to reform 
 his life. He became strict with himself in word and deed. "He set the Commandments 
 before him for his way to heaven." "He thought if he could but keep them pretty 
 well he should have comfort." If now and then he broke one of them, he suffered 
 in conscience; he repented of his fault; he made good resolutions for the future, 
 and straggled to carry them out "His neighbours took him to be a new man, and marvelled 
 at the alteration." Pleasure of any kind, even the most innocent, he considered 
 to be a snare to him, and he abandoned it. He had been fond of dancing, but he gave 
 it up. Music and singing he parted with, though it distressed him to leave them. 
 Of all amusements, that in which he had most delighted had been in ringing the bells 
 in Elstow church tower. With his bells he could not part all at once. He would no 
 longer ring himself: but when his friends were enjoying themselves with the ropes, 
 he could not help going now and then to the tower door to look on and listen; but 
 he feared at last that the steeple might fall upon him and kill him. We call such 
 scruples in these days exaggerated and fantastic. We are no longer in danger ourselves 
 of suffering from similar emotions. Whether we are the better for having got rid 
 of them will be seen in the future history of our race. </p>
 <p align="left">Notwithstanding his struggles and his sacrifices, Bunyan found that 
 they did not bring him the peace which he expected. A man can change his outward 
 conduct; but if he is in earnest, he comes in sight of other features in himself 
 which he cannot change so easily--the meannesses, the paltrinesses, the selfishnesses 
 which haunt him in spite of himself, which start out upon him at moments the most 
 unlooked for, which taint the best of his actions and make him loathe and hate himself. 
 Bunyan's life was now, for so young a person, a model of correctness; but he had 
 no sooner brought his actions straight than he discovered that he was admiring and 
 approving of himself. No situation is more humiliating, none brings with it a feeling 
 of more entire hopelessness. "All this while," he says, "I knew not Christ, nor 
 grace, nor faith, nor hope; and had I then died, my state had been most fearful. 
 I was but a poor painted hypocrite, going about to establish my own righteousness."
 </p>
 <p align="left">Like his own Pilgrim, he had the burden on his back of his conscious 
 unworthiness. How was he to be rid of it? </p>
 <p align="left">"One day, in a street in Bedford, as he was at work in his calling, 
 he fell in with three or four poor women sitting at a door in the sun talking about 
 the things of God." He was himself at that time "a brisk talker" about the matters 
 of religion, and he joined these women. Their expressions were wholly unintelligible 
 to him. "They were speaking of the wretchedness of their own hearts, of their unbelief, 
 of their miserable state. They did contemn, slight, and abhor their own righteousness 
 as filthy and insufficient to do them any good. They spoke of a new birth and of 
 the work of God in their hearts, which comforted and strengthened them against the 
 temptations of the devil." </p>
 <p align="left">The language of the poor women has lost its old meaning. They themselves, 
 if they were alive, would not use it any longer. The conventional phrases of Evangelical 
 Christianity ring untrue in a modern ear like a cracked bell. We have grown so accustomed 
 to them as a cant, that we can hardly believe that they ever stood for sincere convictions. 
 Yet these forms were once alive with the profoundest of all moral truths--a truth 
 not of a narrow theology, but which lies at the very bottom of the well, at the 
 fountain-head of human morality; namely, that a man who would work out his salvation 
 must cast out self, though he rend his heart-strings in doing it; not love of self-indulgence 
 only, but self-applause, self-confidence, self-conceit and vanity, desire or expectation 
 of reward; self in all the subtle ingenuities with which it winds about the soul. 
 In one dialect or another, he must recognize that he is himself a poor creature 
 not worth thinking of, or he will not take the first step towards excellence in 
 any single thing which he undertakes. </p>
 <p align="left">Bunyan left the women and went about his work, but their talk went 
 with him. "He was greatly affected." "He saw that he wanted the true tokens of a 
 godly man." He sought them out, and spoke with them again and again. He could not 
 stay away; and the more he went, the more he questioned his condition. </p>
 <p align="left">"I found two things," he says, "at which I did some-limes marvel, 
 considering what a blind, ungodly wretch but just before I was; one, a great softness 
 and tenderness of heart, which caused me to fall under the conviction of what, by 
 Scripture, they asserted; the other, a great bending of my mind to a continual meditating 
 on it. My mind was now like a horse-leech at the vein, still crying, Give, give; 
 so fixed on eternity and on the kingdom of heaven (though I knew but little), that 
 neither pleasure, nor profit, nor persuasion, nor threats could loosen it or make 
 it let go its hold. It is in very deed a certain truth; it would have been then 
 as difficult for me to have taken my mind from heaven to earth, as I have found 
 it often since to get it from earth to heaven." </p>
 <p align="left">Ordinary persons who are conscious of trying to do right, who resist 
 temptations, are sorry when they slip, and determine to be more on their guard for 
 the future, are well contented with the condition which they have reached. They 
 are respectable; they are right-minded in common things; they fulfil their every-day 
 duties to their families and to society with a sufficiency for which the world speaks 
 well of them, as indeed it ought to speak; and they themselves acquiesce in the 
 world's verdict. Any passionate agitation about the state of their souls they consider 
 unreal and affected. Such men may be amiable in private life, good neighbours, and 
 useful citizens; but be their talents what they may, they could not write a <i>Pilgrim's 
 Progress, </i>or ever reach the Delectable Mountains, or even be conscious that 
 such mountains exist. </p>
 <p align="left">Bunyan was on the threshold of the higher life. He knew that he 
 was a very poor creature. He longed to rise to something better. He was a mere ignorant, 
 untaught mechanic. He had not been to school with Aristotle and Plato. He could 
 not help himself, or lose himself in the speculations of poets and philosophers. 
 He had only the Bible, and, studying the Bible, he found that the wonder-working 
 power in man's nature was Faith. Faith! What was it? What did it mean? Had he faith? 
 He was but "a poor sot," and yet he thought that he could not be wholly without 
 it. The Bible told him that if he had faith as a grain of mustard-seed, he could 
 work miracles. He did not understand Oriental metaphors; here was a simple test 
 which could be at once applied. </p>
 <p align="left">"One day," he writes, "as I was between Elstow and Bedford, the 
 temptation was hot upon me to try if I had faith by doing some miracle. I must say 
 to the puddles that were in the horse-pads, "be dry," and truly at one time I was 
 agoing to say so indeed. But just as I was about to speak, the thought came into 
 my mind: Go under yonder hedge first and pray that God would make you able. But 
 when I had concluded to pray, this came hot upon me, that if I prayed and came again 
 and tried to do it, and yet did nothing notwithstanding, then be sure I had no faith, 
 but was a castaway, and lost. Nay, thought I, if it be so, I will never try it yet, 
 but will stay a little longer. Thus was I tossed between the devil and my own ignorance, 
 and so perplexed at some times that I could not tell what to do." </p>
 <p align="left">Common-sense will call this disease, and will think impatiently 
 that the young tinker would have done better to attend to his business. But it must 
 be observed that Bunyan was attending to his business, toiling all the while with 
 grimed hands over his pots and kettles. No one ever complained that the pots and 
 kettles were ill-mended. It was merely that, being simple-minded, he found in his 
 Bible that, besides earning his bread, he had to save or lose his soul. Having no 
 other guide, he took its words literally, and the directions puzzled him. </p>
 <p align="left">He grew more and more unhappy, more lowly in his own eyes-- </p>
 <p align="left">"Wishing him like to those more rich in hope"-- </p>
 <p align="left">like the women who were so far beyond him on the heavenly road. 
 He was a poet without knowing it, and his gifts only served to perplex him further. 
 His speculations assumed bodily forms which he supposed to be actual visions. He 
 saw his poor friends sitting on the sunny side of a high mountain refreshing themselves 
 in the warmth, while he was shivering in frost, and snow, and mist. The mountain 
 was surrounded by a wall, through which he tried to pass, and searched long in vain 
 for an opening through it. At last he found one, very straight and narrow, through 
 which he struggled, after desperate efforts. "It showed him," he said, "that none 
 could enter into life but those who were in downright earnest, and unless they left 
 the wicked world behind them; for here was only room for body and soul, but not 
 for body and soul and sin." The vision brought him no comfort, for it passed away, 
 and left him still on the wrong side: a little comfortable self-conceit would have 
 set him at rest. But, like all real men, Bunyan had the worst opinion of himself. 
 He looked at his Bible again. He found that he must be elected. Was he elected? 
 He could as little tell as whether he had faith. He knew that he longed to be elected, 
 but "the Scripture trampled on his desire;" for it said, "It is not of him that 
 willeth, or of him that run-neth, but of God that sheweth mercy;" therefore, unless 
 God had chosen him, his labour was in vain. The devil saw his opportunity; the devil, 
 among his other attributes, must have possessed that of omnipresence; for whenever 
 any human soul was in straits, he was personally at hand to take advantage of it.

 <p align="left">"It may be that you are not elected," the tempter said to Bunyan. 
 "It may be so indeed," thought he. "Why, then," said Satan, "you had as good leave 
 off and strive no farther; for if, indeed, you should not be elected and chosen 
 of God, there is no talk of your being saved." </p>
 <p align="left">A comforting text suggested itself. "Look at the generations of 
 old; did any ever trust in the Lord and was confounded?" But these exact words, 
 unfortunately, were only to be found in the Apocrypha. And there was a further distressing 
 possibility, which has occurred to others besides Bunyan. Perhaps the day of grace 
 was passed. It came on him one day as he walked in the country that perhaps those 
 good people in Bedford were all that the Lord would save in those parts, and that 
 he came too late for the blessing. True, Christ had said, "Compel them to come in, 
 for yet there is room." It might be "that when Christ spoke those words," He was 
 thinking of him --him among the rest that he had chosen, and had mean to encourage 
 him. But Bunyan was too simply modest to gather comfort from such aspiring thoughts. 
 He do sired to be converted, craved for it, longed for it with all his heart and 
 soul. "Could it have been gotten for gold," he said, "what would I not have given 
 for it! Had I had a whole world it had all gone ten thousand times over for this, 
 that my soul might have been in a converted state. But, oh! I was made sick by that 
 saying of Christ: 'He called to Him whom He would, and they came to Him.' I feared 
 He would not call me." </p>
 <p align="left">Election, conversion, day of grace, coming to Christ, have been 
 pawed and fingered by unctuous hands for now two hundred years. The bloom is gone 
 from the flower. The plumage, once shining with hues direct from heaven, is soiled 
 and bedraggled. The most solemn of all realities have been degraded into the passwords 
 of technical theology. In Bunyan's day, in camp and council chamber, in High Courts 
 of Parliament, and among the poor drudges in English villages, they were still radiant 
 with spiritual meaning. The dialect may alter; but if man is more than a brief floating 
 bubble on the eternal river of time; if there be really an immortal part of him 
 which need not perish; and if his business on earth is to save it from perishing-- 
 he will still try to pierce the mountain barrier; he will still find the work as 
 hard as Bunyan found it. We live in days of progress and enlightenment; nature on 
 a hundred sides has unlocked her storehouses of knowledge. But she has furnished 
 no "open sesame" to bid the mountain gate fly wide which leads to conquest of self. 
 There is still no passage there for "body and soul and sin." </p>
