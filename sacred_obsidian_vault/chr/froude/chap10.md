 </h2>
 <p align="left">LITTLE remains to be told of Bunyan's concluding years. No friends 
 preserved his letters. No diaries of his own survive to gratify curiosity. Men truly 
 eminent think too meanly of themselves or their work to care much to be personally 
 remembered. He lived for sixteen years after his release from the gaol, and those 
 years were spent in the peaceful discharge of his congregational duties, in writing, 
 in visiting the scattered members of the Baptist communion, or in preaching in the 
 villages and woods. His outward circumstances were easy. He had a small but well-provided 
 house in Bedford, into which he collected rare and valuable pieces of old furniture 
 and plate, and other articles--presents, probably, from those who admired him. He 
 visited London annually to preach in the Baptist churches. <i>The Pilgrim's Progress
 </i>spread his fame over England, over Europe, and over the American settlements. 
 It was translated into many languages; and so catholic was its spirit, that it was 
 adapted with a few alterations for the use even of the Catholics themselves. He 
 abstained, as he had done steadily throughout his life, from all interference with 
 politics, and the Government in turn never again meddled with him. He even received 
 offers of promotion to larger spheres of action, which might have tempted a meaner 
 nature. But he could never be induced to leave Bedford, and there he quietly stayed 
 through changes of ministry, Popish plots, and Monmouth rebellions, while the terror 
 of a restoration of Popery was bringing on the Revolution--careless of kings and 
 cabinets, and confident that Giant Pope had lost his power for harm, and thenceforward 
 could only bite his nails at the passing pilgrims. Once only, after the failure 
 of the Exclusion Bill, he seems to have feared that violent measures might again 
 be tried against him. It is even said that he was threatened with arrest, and it 
 was on this occasion that he made over his property to his wife. The policy of James 
 II., however, transparently treacherous though it was, for the time gave security 
 to the Nonconformist congregations; and in the years which immediately preceded 
 the final expulsion of the Stuarts, liberty of conscience was under fewer restrictions 
 than it had been in the most rigorous days of the Reformation, or under the Long 
 Parliament itself. Thus the anxiety passed away, and Bunyan was left undisturbed 
 to finish his earthly work. </p>
 <p>He was happy in his family. His blind child, for whom he had been so touchingly 
 anxious, had died while he was in prison. His other children lived and did well; 
 and his brave companion, who had spoken so stoutly for him to the judges, continued 
 at his side. His health, it was said, had suffered from his confinement; but the 
 only serious illness which we hear of was an attack of "sweating sickness," which 
 came upon him in 1687, and from which he never thoroughly recovered. He was then 
 fifty-nine, and in the next year he died. </p>
 <p>His end was characteristic. It was brought on by exposure when he was engaged 
 in an act of charity. A quarrel had broken out in a family at Reading with which 
 Bunyan had some acquaintance. A father had taken offence at his son, and threatened 
 to disinherit him. Bunyan undertook a journey on horseback from Bedford to Reading 
 in the hope of reconciling them. He succeeded, but at the cost of his life. Returning 
 by London, he was overtaken on the road by a storm of rain, and was wetted through 
 before he could find shelter. The chill, falling on a constitution already weakened 
 by illness, brought on fever. He was able to reach the house of Mr. Strudwick, one 
 his London friends; but he never left his bed afterwards. In ten days he was dead. 
 The exact date is uncertain. It was towards the end of August, 1688, between two 
 and three months before the landing of King William. He was buried in Mr. Strudwick's 
 vault, in the Dissenters' burying-ground at Bunhill Fields. His last words were, 
 "Take me, for I come to Thee." </p>
 <p>So ended, at the age of sixty, a man who, if his importance may be measured by 
 the influence which he has exerted over succeeding generations, must be counted 
 among the most extraordinary persons whom England has produced. It has been the 
 fashion to dwell on the disadvantages of his education, and to regret the carelessness 
 of nature which brought into existence a man of genius in a tinker's hut at Elstow. 
 Nature is less partial than she appears, and all situations in life have their compensations 
 along with them. </p>
 <p>Circumstances, I should say, qualified Bunyan perfectly well for the work which 
 he had to do. If he had gone to school, as he said, with Aristotle and Plato; if 
 he had been broken in at a university and been turned into a bishop; if he had been 
 in any one of the learned professions, he might easily have lost, or might have 
 never known, the secret of his powers. He was born to be the Poet-apostle of the 
 English middle classes, imperfectly educated like himself; and, being one of themselves, 
 he had the key of their thoughts and feelings in his own heart. Like nine out of 
 ten of his countrymen, he came into the world with no fortune but his industry. 
 He had to work with his hands for his bread, and to advance by the side of his neighbours 
 along the road of common business. His knowledge was scanty, though of rare quality. 
 He knew his Bible probably by heart. He had studied history in Foxe's <i>Martyrs,
 </i>but nowhere else that we can trace. The rest of his mental furniture was gathered 
 at first hand from his conscience, his life, and his occupations. Thus, every idea 
 which he received falling into a soil naturally fertile, sprouted up fresh, vigorous, 
 and original. He confessed to have felt (as a man of his powers could hardly have 
 failed to feel) continued doubts about the Bible and the reality of the Divine government. 
 It has been well said that when we look into the world to find the image of God, 
 it is as if we were to stand before a looking-glass, expecting to see ourselves 
 reflected there, and to see nothing. Education scarcely improves our perception 
 in this respect; and wider information, wider acquaintance with the thoughts of 
 other men in other ages and countries, might as easily have increased his difficulties 
 as have assisted him in overcoming them. He was not a man who could have contented 
 himself with compromises and half-convictions. No force could have subdued him into 
 a decent Anglican divine--a "Mr. Two Tongues, parson of the parish." He was passionate 
 and thorough-going. The authority of conscience presented itself to him only in 
 the shape of religious obligation. Religion once shaken into a "perhaps," would 
 have had no existence to him; and it is easy to conceive a university-bred Bunyan, 
 an intellectual meteor, flaring uselessly across the sky and disappearing in smoke 
 and nothingness. </p>
 <p>Powerful temperaments are necessarily intense. Bunyan, born a tinker, had heard 
 right and wrong preached to him in the name of the Christian creed. He concluded 
 after a struggle that Christianity was true, and on that conviction he built himself 
 up into what he was. It might have been the same, perhaps, with Burns had he been 
 born a century before. Given Christianity as an unquestionably true account of the 
 situation and future prospects of man, the feature of it most appalling to the imagination 
 is that hell-fire--a torment exceeding the most horrible which fancy can conceive, 
 and extending into eternity-- awaits the enormous majority of the human race. The 
 dreadful probability seized hold on the young Bunyan's mind. He shuddered at it 
 when awake. In the visions of the night it came before him in the tremendous details 
 of the dreadful reality. It became the governing thought in his nature. </p>
 <p>Such a belief, if it does not drive a man to madness, will at least cure him 
 of trifling. It will clear his mind of false sentiment, take the nonsense out of 
 him, and enable him to resist vulgar temptation as nothing else will. The danger 
 is that the mind may not bear the strain, that the belief itself may crack and leave 
 nothing. Bunyan was hardly tried, but in him the belief did not crack. It spread 
 over his character. It filled him first with terror; then with a loathing of sin, 
 which entailed so awful a penalty; then, as his personal fears were allayed by the 
 recognition of Christ, it turned to tenderness and pity. </p>
 <p>There was no fanaticism in Bunyan; nothing harsh or savage. His natural humour 
 perhaps saved him. His few recorded sayings all refer to the one central question; 
 but healthy seriousness often best expresses itself in playful quaintness. He was 
 once going somewhere disguised as a waggoner. He was overtaken by a constable who 
 had a warrant to arrest him. The constable asked him if he knew that devil of a 
 fellow Bunyan. "Know him!" Bunyan said. "You might call him a devil if you knew 
 him as well as I once did." </p>
 <p>A Cambridge student was trying to show him what a divine thing reason was--"reason, 
 the chief glory of man, which distinguished him from a beast," &amp;c., &amp;c. </p>
 <p>Bunyan growled out: "Sin distinguishes man from beast. Is sin divine?" </p>
 <p>He was extremely tolerant in his terms of Church membership. He offended the 
 stricter part of his congregation by refusing even to make infant baptism a condition 
 of exclusion. The only persons with whom he declined to communicate were those whose 
 lives were openly immoral. His chief objection to the Church of England was the 
 admission of the ungodly to the Sacraments. He hated party titles and quarrels upon 
 trifles. He desired himself to be called a Christian or a Believer, or "any name 
 which was approved by the Holy Ghost." Divisions, he said, were to Churches like 
 wars to countries. Those who talked most about religion cared least for it; and 
 controversies about doubtful things, and things of little moment, ate up all zeal 
 for things which were practicable and indisputable. </p>
 <p>"In countenance," wrote a friend, "he appeared to be of a stern and rough temper, 
 but in his conversation mild and affable; not given to loquacity or to much discourse 
 in company unless some urgent occasion required it; observing never to boast of 
 himself or his parts, but rather to seem low in his own eyes, and submit himself 
 to the judgment of others; abhorring lying and swearing; being just, in all that 
 lay in his power, to his word; not seeming to revenge injuries; loving to reconcile 
 differences and make friendships with all. He had a sharp, quick eye, with an excellent 
 discerning of persons, being of good judgment and quick wit." "He was tall of stature, 
 strong-boned, though not corpulent, somewhat of a ruddy face, with sparkling eyes, 
 wearing his hair on his upper lip; his hair reddish, but in his later days time 
 had sprinkled it with grey; his nose well set, but not declining or bending; his 
 mouth moderate large, his forehead something high, and his habit always plain and 
 modest." </p>
 <p>He was himself indifferent to advancement, and he did not seek it for his family. 
 A London merchant offered to take his son into his house. "God," he said, "did not 
 send me to advance my family, but to preach the Gospel." He had no vanity--an exemption 
 extremely rare in those who are personally much before the public. The personal 
 popularity was in fact the part of his situation which he least liked. When he was 
 to preach in London, "if there was but one day's notice the meeting-house was crowded 
 to overflowing." Twelve hundred people would be found collected before seven o'clock 
 on a dark winter's morning to hear a lecture from him. In Zoar Street, Southwark, 
 his church was sometimes so crowded that he had to be lifted to the pulpit stairs 
 over the congregation's heads. It pleased him, but he was on the watch against the 
 pleasure of being himself admired. A friend complimented him once, after service, 
 on "the sweet sermon" which he had delivered. "You need not remind me of that," 
 he said. "The devil told me of it before I was out of the pulpit." </p>
 <p>"Conviction of sin" has become a conventional phrase, shallow and ineffective 
 even in those who use it most sincerely. Yet moral evil is still the cause of nine-tenths 
 of the misery in the world, and it is not easy to measure the value of a man who 
 could prolong the conscious sense of the deadly nature of it, even tinder the forms 
 of a decomposing theology. Times are changing. The intellectual current is bearing 
 us we know not where, and the course of the stream is in a direction which leads 
 us far from the conclusions in which Bunyan and the Puritans established themselves; 
 but the truths which are most essential for us to know cannot be discerned by speculative 
 arguments. Chemistry cannot tell us why some food is wholesome and other food is 
 poisonous. That food is best for us which best nourishes the body into health and 
 strength; and a belief in a Supernatural Power which has given us a law to live 
 by, and to which we are responsible for our conduct, has alone, of all the influences 
 known to us, succeeded in ennobling and elevating the character of man. The particular 
 theories which men have formed about it have often been wild and extravagant. Imagination, 
 agitated by fear or stimulated by pious enthusiasm, has peopled heaven with demigods 
 and saints--creations of fancy, human forms projected upon a mist and magnified 
 into celestial images. How much is true of all that men have believed in past times 
 and have now ceased to believe, how much has been a too eager dream, no one now 
 can tell. It may be that other foundations may be laid hereafter for human conduct 
 on which an edifice can be raised no less fair and beautiful; but no signs of it 
 are as yet apparent. </p>
 <p>So far as we yet know, morality rests upon a sense of obligation; and obligation 
 has no meaning except as implying a Divine command, without which it would cense 
 to be. Until "duty" can be presented to us in a shape which will compel our recognition 
 of it with equal or superior force, the passing away of "the conviction of sin" 
 can operate only to obscure our aspirations after a high ideal of life and character. 
 The scientific theory may be correct, and it is possible that we may be standing 
 on the verge of the most momentous intellectual revolution which has been experienced 
 in the history of our race. It may be so, and also it may not be so. It may be that 
 the most important factors in the scientific equation are beyond the reach of human 
 intellect. However it be, the meat which gives strength to the man is poison to 
 the child; and as yet we are still children, and are likely to remain children. 
 "Every relief from outward restraint," says one who was not given to superstition, 
 "if it be not attended with increased power of self-command, is simply fatal." Men 
 of intelligence, therefore, to whom life is not a theory but a stern fact, conditioned 
 round with endless possibilities of wrong and suffering, though they may never again 
 adopt the letter of Bunyan's creed, will continue to see in conscience an authority 
 for which culture is no substitute; they will conclude that in one form or other 
 responsibility is not a fiction but a truth; and, so long as this conviction lasts,
 <i>The Pilgrim's Progress </i>will still be dear to all men of all creeds who share 
 in it, even though it pleases the "elect" modern philosophers to describe its author 
 as a "Philistine of genius." </p>
