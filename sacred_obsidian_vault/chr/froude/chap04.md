 <h2 align="center"><span style="font-weight: 400">CALL TO THE MINISTRY. </span> </h2>
 <p align="left">THE Pilgrim falls into the hands of Giant Despair because he has 
 himself first strayed into Byepath Meadow. Bunyan found an explanation of his last 
 convulsion in an act of unbelief, on which, on looking back, he perceived that he 
 had been guilty. He had been delivered out of his first temptation. He had not been 
 sufficiently on his guard against temptations that might come in the future; nay, 
 he had himself tempted God. His wife had been overtaken by a premature confinement, 
 and was suffering acutely. It was at the time when Bunyan was exercised with questions 
 about the truth of religion altogether. As the poor woman lay crying at his side, 
 he had said, mentally, "Lord, if Thou wilt now remove this sad affliction from ray 
 wife, and cause that she be troubled no more therewith this night, then I shall 
 know that Thou canst discern the more secret thoughts of the heart." In a moment 
 the pain ceased, and she fell into a sleep which lasted till morning. Bunyan, though 
 surprised at the time, forgot what had happened, till it rushed back upon his memory, 
 when he had committed himself by a similar mental assent to selling Christ. He remembered 
 the proof which had been given to him that God could and did discern his thoughts. 
 God had discerned this second thought also, and in punishing him for it had punished 
 him at the same time for the doubt which he had allowed himself to feel. "I should 
 have believed His word," he said, "and not have put an 'if' upon the all-seeingness 
 of God." </p>
 <p align="left">The suffering was over now, and he felt that it had been infinitely 
 beneficial to him. He understood better the glory of God and of his Son. The Scriptures 
 had opened their secrets to him, and he had seen them to be in very truth the keys 
 of the kingdom of Heaven. Never so clearly as after this "temptation" had he perceived 
 "the heights of grace, and love, and mercy." Two or three times "he had such strange 
 apprehensions of the grace of God as had amazed him." The impression was so overpowering 
 that if it had continued long "it would have rendered him incapable for business." 
 He joined his friend Mr. Gifford's church. He was baptised in the Ouse, and became 
 a professed member of the Baptist congregation. Soon after, his mental conflict 
 was entirely over, and he had two quiet years of peace. Before a man can use his 
 powers to any purpose, he must arrive at some conviction in which his intellect 
 can acquiesce. "Calm yourself," says Jean Paul; "it is your first necessity. Be 
 a stoic, if nothing else will serve." Bunyan had not been driven into stoicism. 
 He was now restored to the possession of his faculties, and his remarkable ability 
 was not long in showing itself. </p>
 <p align="left">The first consequence of his mental troubles was an illness. He 
 had a cough which threatened to turn into consumption. He thought it was all over 
 with him, and he was fixing his eyes "on the heavenly Jerusalem and the innumerable 
 company of angels;" but the danger passed off, and he became well and strong in 
 mind and body. </p>
 <p align="left">Notwithstanding his various miseries, he had not neglected his business, 
 and had, indeed, been specially successful. </p>
 <p align="left">By the time that he was twenty-five years old he was in a position 
 considerably superior to that in which he was born. "God," says a contemporary biographer, 
 "had increased his stores so that he lived in great credit among his neighbours." 
 On May 13, 1653, Bedfordshire sent an address to Cromwell approving the dismissal 
 of the Long Parliament, recognising Oliver himself as the Lord's instrument, and 
 recommending the county magistrates as fit persons to serve in the Assembly which 
 was to take its place. Among thirty-six names attached to this document appear those 
 of Gifford and Bunyan. This speaks for itself: be must have been at least a householder 
 and a person of consideration. It was not, however, as a prosperous brazier that 
 Bunyan was to make his way. He had a gift of speech, which, in the democratic congregation 
 to which he belonged, could not long remain hid. Young as he was, he had sounded 
 the depths of spiritual experience. Like Dante, he had been in hell--the popular 
 hell of English Puritanism--and in 1655, he was called upon to take part in the "ministry." 
 He was modest, humble, shrinking. The minister when he preached was, according to 
 the theory, an instrument uttering the words not of himself but of the Holy Spirit. 
 A man like Bunyan, who really believed this, might well be alarmed. After earnest 
 entreaty, however, "he made experiment of his powers" in private, and it was at 
 once evident that, with the thing which these people meant by inspiration, he was 
 abundantly supplied. No such preacher to the uneducated English masses was to be 
 found within the four seas. He says that he had no desire of vainglory; no one who 
 has studied his character can suppose that he had. He was a man of natural genius, 
 who believed the Protestant form of Christianity to be completely true. He knew 
 nothing of philosophy, nothing of history, nothing of literature. The doubts to 
 which he acknowledged being without their natural food, had never presented themselves 
 in a form which would have compelled him to submit to remain uncertain. Doubt, as 
 he had felt it, was a direct enemy of morality and purity, and as such he had fought 
 with it and conquered it. Protestant Christianity was true. All mankind were perishing 
 unless they saw it to be true. This was his message; a message--supposing him to 
 have been right--of an importance so immeasurable that all else was nothing. He was 
 still "afflicted with the fiery darts of the devil," but he saw that he must not 
 bury his abilities. "In fear and trembling," therefore, he set himself to the work, 
 and "did according to his power preach the Gospel that God had shewn him." </p>
 <p align="left">"The Lord led him to begin where his Word began-- with sinners. This 
 part of my work," he says, "I fulfilled with a great sense, for the terrors of the 
 law and guilt for my transgressions lay heavy on my conscience. I preached what 
 I felt. I had been sent to my hearers as from the dead. I went myself in chains 
 to preach to them in chains, and carried that fire in my own conscience that I persuaded 
 them to beware of. I have gone full of guilt and terror to the pulpit door; God 
 carried me on with a strong hand, for neither guilt nor hell could take me off."
 </p>
 <p align="left">Many of Bunyan's addresses remain in the form of theological treatises, 
 and, that I may not have to return to the subject, I shall give some account of 
 them. His doctrine was the doctrine of the best and strongest minds in Europe. It 
 had been believed by Luther, it had been believed by Knox. It was believed at that 
 moment by Oliver Cromwell as completely as by Bunyan himself. It was believed, so 
 far as such a person could be said to believe anything, by the all-accomplished 
 Leibnitz himself. Few educated people use the language of it now. In them it was 
 a fire from heaven shining like a sun in a dark world. With us the fire has gone 
 out; in the place of it we have but smoke and ashes; and the Evangelical mind, in 
 search of "something deeper and truer than satisfied the last century," is turning 
 back to Catholic verities. What Bunyan had to say may be less than the whole truth: 
 we shall scarcely find the still missing part of it in lines of thought which we 
 have outgrown. </p>
 <p align="left">Bunyan preached wherever opportunity served--in woods, in barns, 
 on village greens, or in town chapels. The substance of his sermons he revised and 
 published. He began, as he said, with sinners, explaining the condition of men in 
 the world. They were under the law, or they were under grace. Every person that 
 came into the world was born under the law, and as such was bound, under pain of 
 eternal damnation, to fulfil completely and continually every one of the Ten Commandments. 
 The Bible said plainly, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things which 
 are written in the book of the law to do them." "The soul that sinneth, it shall 
 die." The Ten Commandments extended into many more, and to fail in a single one 
 was as fatal as to break them all. A man might go on for a long time, for sixty 
 years perhaps, without falling. Bunyan does not mean that anyone really could do 
 all this, but he assumes the possibility; yet he says if the man slipped once before 
 he died, he would eternally perish. The law does not refer to words and actions 
 only, but to thoughts and feelings. It followed a man in his prayers, and detected 
 a wandering thought. It allowed no repentance to those who lived and died under 
 it. If it was asked whether God could not pardon, as earthly judges pardon criminals, 
 the answer was that it is not the law which is merciful to the earthly offender, 
 but the magistrate. The law is an eternal principle. The magistrate may forgive 
 a man without exacting satisfaction. The law knows no forgiveness. It can be as 
 little changed as an axiom of mathematics. Repentance cannot undo the past. Let 
 a man leave his sins and live as purely as an angel all the rest of his life, his 
 old faults remain in the account against him, and his state is as bad as ever it 
 was. God's justice once offended knows not pity or compassion, but runs on the offender 
 like a lion and throws him into prison, there to lie to all eternity unless infinite 
 satisfaction be given to it. And that satisfaction no son of Adam could possibly 
 make. </p>
 <p align="left">This conception of Divine justice, not as a sentence of a judge, 
 but as the action of an eternal law, is identical with Spinoza's. That every act 
 involves consequences which cannot be separated from it, and may continue operative 
 to eternity, is a philosophical position which is now generally admitted. Combined 
 with the traditionary notions of a future judgment and punishment in hell, the recognition 
 that there was a law in the case, and that the law could not be broken, led to the 
 frightful inference that each individual was liable to be kept alive and tortured 
 through all eternity. And this, in fact, was the fate really in store for every 
 human creature unless some extraordinary remedy could be found. Bunyan would allow 
 no merit to anyone. He would not have it supposed that only the profane or grossly 
 wicked were in danger from the law. "A man," he says, "may be turned from a vain, 
 loose, open, profane conversation and sinning against the law, to a holy, righteous, 
 religious life, and yet be under the same state and as sure to be damned as the 
 others that are more profane and loose." The natural man might think it strange, 
 but the language of the curse was not to be mistaken. Cursed is every one who has 
 failed to fulfil the whole law. There was not a person in the whole world who had 
 not himself sinned in early life. All had sinned in Adam also, and St. Paul had 
 said in consequence, "'There is none that doeth good, no, not one!' The law was 
 given not that we might be saved by obeying it, but that we might know the holiness 
 of God and our own vileness, aud that we might understand that we should not be 
 damned for nothing. God would have no quarrelling at His just condemning of us at 
 that day." </p>
 <p align="left">This is Bunyan's notion of the position in which we all naturally 
 stand in this world, and from which the substitution of Christ's perfect fulfilment 
 of the law alone rescues us. It is calculated, no doubt, to impress on us a profound 
 horror of moral evil when the penalty attached to it is so fearful. But it is dangerous 
 to introduce into religion metaphysical conceptions of "law." The cord cracks that 
 is strained too tightly; and it is only for brief periods of high spiritual tension 
 that a theology so merciless can sustain itself. No one with a conscience in him 
 will think of claiming any merit for himself. But we know also that there are degrees 
 of demerit, and, theory or no theory, we fall back on the first verse of the English 
 Liturgy, as containing a more endurable account of things. </p>
 <p align="left">For this reason, among others, Bunyan disliked the Liturgy. He thought 
 the doctrine of it false, and he objected to a Liturgy on principle. He has a sermon 
 on Prayer, in which he insists that to be worth anything prayer must be the expression 
 of an inward feeling; and that people cannot feel in lines laid down for them.
 </p>
 <p align="left">Forms of prayer he thought especially mischievous to children, as 
 accustoming them to use words to which they attached no meaning. </p>
 <p align="left">"My judgment," he says, "is that men go the wrong way to learn their 
 children to pray. It seems to me a better way for people to tell their children 
 betimes what cursed creatures they are, how they are under the wrath of God by reason 
 of original aud actual sin; also to tell them the nature of God's wrath and the 
 duration of misery, which, if they would conscientiously do, they would sooner learn 
 their children to pray than they do. The way that men learn to pray is by conviction 
 of sin, and this is the way to make our 'sweet babes' do so too." </p>
 <p align="left">"Sweet babes" is unworthy of Bunyan. There is little sweetness in 
 a state of things so stern as he conceives. He might have considered, too, that 
 there was a danger of making children unreal in another and worse sense by teaching 
 them doctrines which neither child nor man can comprehend. It may be true that a 
 single sin may consign me to everlasting hell, but I cannot be made to acknowledge 
 the justice of it. "Wrath of God" and such expressions are out of place when we 
 are brought into the presence of metaphysical laws. Wrath corresponds to free-will 
 misused. It is senseless and extravagant when pronounced against actions which men 
 cannot help, when the faulty action is the necessary consequence of their nature, 
 and the penalty the necessary consequence of the action. </p>
 <p align="left">The same confusion of thought lies in the treatment of the kindred 
 subjects of Free-will, Election, and Reprobation. The logic must be maintained, 
 and God's moral attributes simultaneously vindicated. Bunyan argues about it as 
 ingeniously as Leibnitz himself. Those who suppose that specific guilt attaches 
 to particular acts, that all men are put into the world free to keep the Commandments 
 or to break them, that they are equally able to do one as to do the other, and are, 
 therefore, proper objects of punishment, hold an opinion which is consistent in 
 itself, but is in entire contradiction with facts. Children are not as able to control 
 their inclinations as grown men, and one man is not as able to control himself as 
 another. Some have no difficulty from the first, and are constitutionally good; 
 some are constitutionally weak, or have incurable propensities for evil. Some are 
 brought up with care and insight; others seem never to have any chance at all. So 
 evident is this, that impartial thinkers have questioned the reality of human guilt 
 in the sense in which it is generally understood. Even Butler allows that if we 
 look too curiously we may have a difficulty in finding where it lies. And here, 
 if anywhere, there is a real natural truth in the doctrine of Election, independent 
 of the merit of those who are so happy as to find favor. Bunyan, however, reverses 
 the inference. He will have all guilty together, those who do well and those who 
 do ill. Even the elect are in themselves as badly off as the reprobate, and are 
 equally included under sin. Those who are saved are saved for Christ's merits and 
 not for their own. </p>
 <p align="left">Men of calmer temperament accept facts as they find them. They are 
 too conscious of their ignorance to insist on explaining problems which are beyond 
 their reach. Bunyan lived in an age of intense religious excitement, when the strongest 
 minds were exercising themselves on those questions. It is noticeable that the most 
 effective intellects inclined to necessitarian conclusions: some in the shape of 
 Calvinism, some in the corresponding philosophic form of Spinozism. From both alike 
 there came an absolute submission to the decrees of God, and a passionate devotion 
 to his service; while the morality of Free-will is cold and calculating. Appeals 
 to a sense of duty do not reach beyond the understanding. The enthusiasm which will 
 stir men's hearts and give them a real power of resisting temptation must be nourished 
 on more invigorating food. </p>
 <p align="left">But I need dwell no more on a subject which is unsuited for these 
 pages. </p>
 <p align="left">The object of Bunyan, like that of Luther, like that of all great 
 spiritual teachers, was to bring his wandering fellow-mortals into obedience to 
 the commandments, even while he insisted on the worthlessness of it. He sounded 
 the strings to others which had sounded loudest in himself. When he passed from 
 mysticism into matters of ordinary life, he showed the same practical good sense 
 which distinguishes the chief of all this order of thinkers--St. Paul. There is a 
 sermon of Bunyan's on Christian behaviour, on the duties of parents to children, 
 and masters to servants, which might be studied with as much advantage in English 
 households as <i>The Pilgrim's Progress </i>itself. To fathers he says, "Take heed 
 that the misdeeds for which thou correctest thy children be not learned them by 
 thee. Many children learn that wickedness of their parents, for which they beat 
 and chastise them. Take heed that thou smile not upon them to encourage them in 
 small faults, lest that thy carriage to them be an encouragement to them to commit 
 greater faults. Take heed that thou use not unsavoury and unseemly words in thy 
 chastising of them, as railing, miscalling, and the like--this is devilish. Take 
 heed that thou do not use them to many chiding words and threatenings, mixed with 
 lightness and laughter. This will harden." </p>
 <p align="left">And again: "I tell you that if parents carry it lovingly towards 
 their children, mixing their mercies with loving rebukes, and their loving rebukes 
 with fatherly and motherly compassions, they are more likely to save their children 
 than by being churlish and severe to them. Even if these things do not save them, 
 if their mercy do them no good, yet it will greatly ease them at the day of death 
 to consider, I have done by love as much as I could to save and deliver my child 
 from hell." </p>
 <p align="left">Whole volumes on education have said less, or less to the purpose, 
 than these simple words. Unfortunately, parents do not read Bunyan. He is left to 
 children. </p>
 <p align="left">Similarly, he says to masters:-- </p>
 <p align="left">"It is thy duty so to behave thyself to thy servant that thy service 
 may not only be for thy good, but for the good of thy servant, and that in body 
 and soul. Deal with him as to admonition as with thy children. Take heed thou do 
 not turn thy servants into slaves by overcharging them in thy work with thy greediness. 
 Take heed thou carry not thyself to thy servant as he of whom it is said, "He is 
 such a man of Belial that his servants cannot speak to him." The Apostle bids you 
 forbear to threaten them, because you also have a Master in Heaven. Masters, give 
 your servants that which is just, just labour and just wages. Servants that are 
 truly godly care not how cheap they serve their masters, provided they may get into 
 godly families, or where they may be convenient for the Word. But if a master or 
 mistress takes this opportunity to make a prey of their servants, it is abominable. 
 I have heard poor servants say that in some carnal families they have had more liberty 
 to God's things and more fairness of dealing than among many professors. Such masters 
 make religion to stink before the inhabitants of the land." </p>
 <p align="left">Bunyan was generally charitable in his judgment upon others. If 
 there was any exception, it was of professors who discredited their calling by conceit 
 and worldliness. </p>
 <p align="left">"No sin," he says, "reigneth more in the world than pride among 
 professors. The thing is too apparent for any man to deny. We may and do see pride 
 display itself in the apparel and carriage of professors almost as much as among 
 any in the land. I have seen church members so decked and bedaubed with their fangles 
 and toys that, when they have been at worship, I have wondered with what faces such 
 painted persons could sit in the place where they were without swooning. I once 
 talked with a maid, by way of reproof for her fond and gaudy garment; she told me 
 the tailor would make it so. Poor proud girl, she gave orders to the tailor to make 
 it so." </p>
 <p align="left">I will give one more extract from Bunyan's pastoral addresses. It 
 belongs to a later period in his ministry, when the law had, for a time, remade 
 Dissent into a crime; but it will throw light on the part of his story which we 
 are now approaching, and it is in every way very characteristic of him. He is speaking 
 to sufferers under persecution. He says to them:-- </p>
 <p align="left">"Take heed of being offended with magistrates, because by their 
 statutes they may cross thy inclinations. It is given, to them to bear the sword, 
 and a command is to thee, if thy heart cannot acquiesce with all things, with meekness 
 and patience to suffer. Discontent in the mind sometimes puts discontent into the 
 mouth; and discontent in the mouth doth sometimes also put a halter about thy neck. 
 For as a man speaking a word in jest may for that be hanged in earnest, so he that 
 speaks in discontent may die for it in sober sadness. Above all, get thy conscience 
 possessed more and more with this, that the magistrate is God's ordinance, and is 
 ordered of God as such; that he is the minister of God to thee for good, and that 
 it is thy duty to fear him and to pray for him; to give thanks to God for him and 
 be subject to him; as both Paul and Peter admonish us; and that not only for wrath, 
 but for conscience' sake. For all other arguments come short of binding the soul 
 when this argument is wanting, until we believe that of God we are bound thereto.
 </p>
 <p align="left">"I speak not these things as knowing any that are disaffected to 
 the government, for I love to be alone, if not with godly men, in things that are 
 convenient. I speak to show my loyalty to the king, and my love to my fellow-subjects, 
 and my desire that all Christians shall walk in ways of peace and truth." </p>
