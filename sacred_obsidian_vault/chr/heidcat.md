 1. Lord's Day</h4>
 <b>Question 1.</b><p>
 <b></b>What is thy only comfort in life and death?</p><p>
 <b>Answer.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>That I with body and soul, both in life and death, (a) </p><p>
 am not my own, (b) </p><p>
 but belong unto my faithful Saviour Jesus Christ; (c) </p><p>
 who, with his precious blood, has fully satisfied for all my sins, (d) </p><p>
 and delivered me from all the power of the devil; (e) </p><p>
 and so preserves me (f) </p><p>
 that without the will of my heavenly Father, not a hair can fall from my head;
 (g)</p><p>
 yea, that all things must be subservient to my salvation, (h) </p><p>
 and therefore, by his Holy Spirit,  He also assures me of eternal life, (i) </p><p>
 and makes me sincerely willing and ready, henceforth, to live unto him. (j)</p><p>

 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Three; (a)</p><p>
 the first, how great my sins and miseries are; (b)</p><p>

 2. Lord's Day</h4>
 <b>Q. 3.</b><p>
 <b></b>Whence knowest thou thy misery?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Out of the law of God. (a)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Rom.3:20.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 4.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>What does the law of God require of us?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Christ teaches us that briefly, Matt. 22:37-40, "Thou shalt love the
 Lord thy God with all thy heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and
 with all thy strength.  This is the first and the great commandment; and the
 second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.  On these two
 commandments hang all the law and the prophets." (a)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Deut.6:5; Lev.19:18; Mark 12:30; Luke 10:27.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 5.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Canst thou keep all these things perfectly?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>In no wise; (a)</p><p>
 for I am prone by nature to hate God and my neighbour.(b)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Rom.3:10,20,23; 1 John 1:8,10. (b) Rom.8:7; Eph.2:3; Tit.3:3;</p><p>
 Gen.6:5; Gen.8:21; Jer.17:9; Rom.7:23.</p><p>
 
 </p><h4 align="center">
 3. Lord's Day</h4>
 <b>Q. 6.</b><p>
 <b></b>Did God then create man so wicked and perverse?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>By no means;</p><p>
 but God created man good, (a)</p><p>
 and after his own image, (b)</p><p>
 in true righteousness and holiness, that he might rightly know God his Creator,
 heartily love him and live with him in eternal happiness to glorify and praise
 him. (c)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Gen.1:31. (b) Gen.1:26,27. (c) Col.3:9,10; Eph.4:23,24; 2</p><p>
 Cor.3:18.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 7.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Whence then proceeds this depravity of human nature?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>From the fall and disobedience of our first parents,</p><p>
 Adam and Eve, in Paradise; (a)</p><p>
 hence our nature is become so corrupt,  that we are all conceived and born in
 sin. (b)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Gen.3; Rom.5:12,18,19. (b) Ps.51:5; Gen.5:3.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 8.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Are we then so corrupt that we are wholly incapable of doing any good,
 and inclined to all wickedness?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Indeed we are; (a)</p><p>
 except we are regenerated by the Spirit of God. (b)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Gen.8:21; John 3:6; Gen.6:5; Job 14:4; Job 15:14,16,36; Isa.53:6.</p><p>
 (b) John 3:3,5; 1 Cor.12:3; 2 Cor.3:5.</p><p>
 
 </p><h4 align="center">
 4. Lord's Day</h4>
 <b>Q. 9.</b><p>
 <b></b>Does not God then do injustice to man, by requiring from him in his law,
 that which he cannot perform?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Not at all; (a)</p><p>
 for God made man capable of performing it;</p><p>
 but man, by the instigation of the devil, (b)</p><p>
 and his own wilful disobedience, (c)</p><p>
 deprived himself and all his posterity of those divine gifts.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Eph.4:24; Eccl.7:29. (b) John 8:44; 2 Cor.11:3; Gen.3:4. (c)</p><p>
 Gen.3:6; Rom.5:12; Gen.3:13; 1 Tim.2:13,14.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 10.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Will God suffer such disobedience and rebellion to go unpunished?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>By no means;</p><p>
 but is terribly displeased (a)</p><p>
 with our original as well as actual sins; and will punish them in his just
 judgment temporally and eternally, (b)</p><p>
 as he has declared, "Cursed is every one that continueth not in all things,
 which are written in the book of the law, to do them." (c)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Gen.2:17; Rom.5:12. (b) Ps.5:5; Ps.50:21; Nah.1:2; Exod.20:5;</p><p>
 Exod.34:7; Rom.1:18; Eph.5:6; Heb.9:27. (c) Deut.27:26; Gal.3:10.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 11.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Is not God then also merciful?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>God is indeed merciful, (a)</p><p>
 but also just; (b)</p><p>
 therefore his justice requires, that sin which is committed against the most
 high majesty of God, be also punished with extreme, that is, with everlasting
 punishment of body and soul.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Exod.34:6,7; Exod.20:6. (b) Ps.7:9; Exod.20:5; Exod.23:7;</p><p>

 <h4 align="center">
 5. Lord's Day</h4>
 <b>Q. 12.</b><p>
 <b></b>Since then, by the righteous judgment of God, we deserve temporal and
 eternal punishment, is there no way by which we may escape that punishment, and
 be again received into favour?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>God will have his justice satisfied: (a)</p><p>
 and therefore we must make this full satisfaction, either by ourselves, or by
 another. (b)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Gen.2:17; Exod.20:5; Exod.23:7; Ezek.18:4; Matt.5:26; 2 Thess.1:6;</p><p>
 Luke 16:2. (b) Rom.8:3,4.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 13.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Can we ourselves then make this satisfaction?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>By no means;</p><p>
 but on the contrary we daily increase our debt. (a)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a). Job 9:2,3; Job 15:15,16; Job 4:18,19; Ps.130:3; Matt.6:12;</p><p>
 Matt.18:25; Matt.16:26.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 14.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Can there be found anywhere, one, who is a mere creature, able to
 satisfy for us?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>None; for, first, God will not punish any other creature for the sin
 which man has committed; (a)</p><p>
 and further, no mere creature can sustain the burden of God's eternal wrath
 against sin, so as to deliver others from it. (b)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Ezek.18:4; Gen.3:17; Heb.2:14-17. (b) Nah.1:6; Ps.130:3.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 15.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>What sort of a mediator and deliverer then must we seek for?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>For one who is very man, and perfectly (a)</p><p>
 righteous; (b)</p><p>
 and yet more powerful than all creatures; that is, one who is also very God.
 (c)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) 1 Cor.15:21; Jer.33:16; Isa.53:9; 2 Cor.5:21. (b) Heb.7:16,26. (c)</p><p>

 </p><h4 align="center">
 6. Lord's day</h4>
 <b>Q. 16. </b><p>
 <b></b>Why must he be very man, and also perfectly righteous?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Because the justice of God requires that the same human nature</p><p>
 which has sinned, should likewise make satisfaction for sin; (a)</p><p>
 and one, who is himself a sinner, cannot satisfy for others. (b)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Ezek.18:4,20; Rom.5:12,15,18; 1 Cor.15:21; Heb.2:14-16; 1</p><p>

 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 17.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Why must he in one person be also very God?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>That he might,</p><p>
 by the power of his Godhead (a)</p><p>
 sustain in his human nature, (b)</p><p>
 the burden of God's wrath; (c)</p><p>
 and might obtain for, and restore to us, righteousness and life. (d)</p><p>
 </p><p>
 (a) Isa.9:6; Isa.63:3. (b) Isa.53:4,11. (c) Deut.4:24; Nah.1:6;</p><p>

 20:28; John 1:4.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 18.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Who then is that Mediator, who is in one person both very God, (a)</p><p>
 and a real (b)</p><p>
 righteous man? (c)</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Our Lord Jesus Christ: (d)</p><p>
 "who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and
 redemption." (e)</p><p>

 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 19.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Whence knowest thou this?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>From the holy gospel, which God himself first revealed in Paradise;
 (a)</p><p>
 and afterwards published by the patriarchs (b)</p><p>
 and prophets, (c)</p><p>
 and represented by the sacrifices and other ceremonies of the law; (d)</p><p>
 and lastly, has fulfilled it by his only begotten Son. (e)</p><p>

 <b>Q. 20.</b><p>
 <b></b>Are all men then, as they perished in Adam, saved by Christ?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>No; (a)</p><p>

 faith. (b)</p><p>

 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 21.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>What is true faith?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>True faith is not only a certain knowledge, whereby I hold for truth all
 that God has revealed to us in his word, (a)</p><p>
 but also an assured confidence, (b)</p><p>
 which the Holy Ghost (c)</p><p>
 works by the gospel in my heart; (d)</p><p>
 that not only to others, but to me also, remission of sin, everlasting
 righteousness and salvation, (e)</p><p>
 are freely given by God, merely of grace, only for the sake of Christ's merits.

 (a) John 20:31; Matt.28:19; Mark 1:15.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 23.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>What are these articles?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>1.  I believe in God the Father, Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth:</p><p>
 2.  And in Jesus Christ, his only begotten Son, our Lord:</p><p>
 3.  Who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary:</p><p>
 4.  Suffered under Pontius Pilate; was crucified, dead, and buried: He
 descended into hell:</p><p>
 5.  The third day he rose again from the dead:</p><p>
 6.  He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at the right hand of God the Father
 Almighty:</p><p>
 7.  From thence he shall come to judge the quick and the dead:</p><p>
 8.  I believe in the Holy Ghost:</p><p>
 9.  I believe a holy catholic church: the communion of saints:</p><p>
 10. The forgiveness of sins:</p><p>
 11. The resurrection of the body:</p><p>
 12. And the life everlasting.</p><p>

 <b></b>How are these articles divided?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Into three parts;</p><p>
 the first is of God the Father, and our creation;</p><p>
 the second of God the Son, and our redemption;</p><p>
 the third of God the Holy Ghost, and our sanctification.

 why speakest thou of Father, Son, and Holy Ghost?</p><p>

 <b></b>What believest thou when thou sayest, "I believe in God the Father,

 by the use of the sacraments. (b)</p><p>

 <b>Q. 66.</b></p><p>

 that I am as certainly washed by his blood and Spirit from all the pollution of

 <b>Q. 70.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>What is it to be washed with the blood and Spirit of Christ?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>It is to receive of God the remission of sins, freely, for the sake of
 Christ's blood, which he shed for us by his sacrifice upon the cross; (a)</p><p>
 and also to be renewed by the Holy Ghost, and sanctified to be members of
 Christ, that so we may more and more die unto sin, and lead holy and unblamable
 lives. (b)</p><p>

 <b></b>Where has Christ promised us, that he will as certainly wash us by his
 blood and Spirit, as we are washed with the water of baptism?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>In the institution of baptism, which is thus expressed:  "Go ye,
 therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and
 of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost", Matt.28:19.</p><p>
 And "he that believeth, and is baptized, shall be saved; but he that believeth
 not, shall be damned.", Mark 16:16.</p><p>

 <b></b>Why then does the Holy Ghost call baptism "the washing of regeneration,"
 and "the washing away of sins"?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>God speaks thus not without great cause, to-wit, not only thereby to
 teach us, that as the filth of the body is purged away by water, so our sins
 are removed by the blood and Spirit of Jesus Christ; (a)</p><p>
 but especially that by this divine pledge and sign he may assure us, that we
 are spiritually cleansed from our sins as really, as we are externally washed
 with water. (b)</p><p>

 <b>Q. 74.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Are infants also to be baptized?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Yes:</p><p>
 for since they, as well as the adult, are included in the covenant and church
 of God; (a)</p><p>
 and since redemption from sin (b)</p><p>
 by the blood of Christ, and the Holy Ghost, the author of faith, is promised to
 them no less than to the adult; (c)</p><p>
 they must therefore by baptism, as a sign of the covenant, be also admitted
 into the christian church; and be distinguished from the children of

 <b></b>How art thou admonished and assured in the Lord's Supper, that thou art
 a partaker of that one sacrifice of Christ, accomplished on the cross, and of
 all his benefits?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thus: That Christ has commanded me and all believers, to eat of this
 broken bread, and to drink of this cup, in remembrance of him, adding these
 promises: (a)</p><p>
 first, that his body was offered and broken on the cross for me, and his blood
 shed for me, as certainly as I see with my eyes, the bread of the Lord broken
 for me, and the cup communicated to me; and further, that he feeds and

 <b>Q. 76.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>What is it then to eat the crucified body, and drink the shed blood of

 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>It is not only to embrace with believing heart all the sufferings and
 death of Christ and thereby to obtain the pardon of sin, and life eternal;
 (a)</p><p>
 but also, besides that, to become more and more united to his sacred body,
 (b)</p><p>
 by the Holy Ghost, who dwells both in Christ and in us; so that we, though
 Christ is in heaven (c)</p><p>

 <b>Q. 77.</b>
 <br>     Where has Christ promised that he will as
 certainly feed and nourish believers with his body and bleed, as they eat of
 this broken bread, and drink of this cup?<br>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>In the institution of the supper, which is thus expressed: (a)
 <br>     "The Lord Jesus, the same night in which he
 was betrayed, took bread, and when he had given thanks, he brake it, and: said:
 eat, this is my body, which is broken for you; this do in remembrance of me.
 After the same manner also he took the cup, when he had supped, saying:  this
 cup is the new testament in my blood; this do ye, as often as ye drink it, in
 remembrance of me.<br>
      For, as often as ye eat this bread, and drink
 this cup, ye do show the Lord's death till he come."  1 Cor.11:23-26.<br>
      This promise is repeated by the holy apostle
 Paul, where he says "The cup of blessing which we bless, is it not the
 communion of the blood of Christ?  The bread which we break, is it not the
 communion of the body of Christ?  For we being many are one bread, and one
 body:  for we are all partakers of that one bread."  1 Cor.10:16,17.<br>

 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Not at all: (a)</p><p>
 but as the water in baptism is not changed into the blood of Christ, neither is
 the washing away of sin itself, being only the sign and confirmation thereof
 appointed of God; (b)</p><p>

 <b></b>Why then doth Christ call the bread "his body", and the cup "his blood",
 or "the new covenant in his blood"; and Paul the "communion of body and blood
 of Christ"?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b>
 <br>     Christ speaks thus, not without great reason,
 namely, not only thereby to teach us, that as bread and wine support this
 temporal life, so his crucified body and shed blood are the true meat and
 drink, whereby our souls are fed to eternal life; (a)<br>
      but more especially by these visible signs and
 pledges to assure us, that we are as really partakers of his true body and
 blood by the operation of the Holy Ghost as we receive by the mouths of our
 bodies these holy signs in remembrance of him; (b)<br>
      and that all his sufferings and obedience are as
 certainly ours, as if we had in our own persons suffered and made satisfaction
 for our sins to God.<br>

 <b>Q. 80.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>What difference is there between the Lord's supper and the popish

 <b></b>The Lord's supper testifies to us, that we have a full pardon of all sin

 on the cross; (a)</p><p>

 who, according to his human nature is now not on earth, but in heaven, at the
 right hand of God his Father, (c)</p><p>
 and will there be worshipped by us. (d)</p><p>
 But the mass teaches, that the living and dead have not the pardon of sins
 through the sufferings of Christ, unless Christ is also daily offered for them
 by the priests; and further, that Christ is bodily under the form of bread and
 wine, and therefore is to be worshipped in them; so that the mass, at bottom,
 is nothing else than a denial of the one sacrifice and sufferings of Jesus
 Christ, and an accursed idolatry. (e)</p><p>

 <b>Q. 92.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>What is the law of God?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>God spake all these words, Exodus 20:1-17 and Denteronomy 5:6-21,
 saying:  I am the LORD thy God, which have brought thee out of the land of
 Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>1st commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thou shalt have no other gods before me.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>2nd commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of any
 thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in
 the water under the earth.  Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve
 them;  for I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the
 fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that
 hate me, and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my
 commandments.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>3rd commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain;  for the LORD
 will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>4th commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy.  Six days shalt thou labour,
 and do all thy work;  but the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God:
 in it thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
 manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is
 within thy gates.  For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea, and
 all that in them is, and rested the seventh day:  wherefore the LORD blessed
 the sabbath day, and hallowed it.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>5th commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Honour thy father and thy mother:  that thy days may be long upon the
 land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>6th commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thou shalt not kill.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>7th commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thou shalt not commit adultery.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>8th commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thou shalt not steal.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>9th commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour.</p><p>
 </p><p>
 <b>10th commandment:</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour's house, thou shalt not covet thy
 neighbour's wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor his
 ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour's.

 <b>Q. 93.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>How are these commandments divided?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>

 duties we owe to our neighbour. (b)</p><p>

 <b></b>What does God enjoin in the first commandment?</p><p>

 flee from all idolatry, (a)</p><p>
 sorcery, soothsaying, superstition, (b)</p><p>
 invocation of saints, or any other creatures; (c)</p><p>
 and learn rightly to know the only true God; (d)</p><p>
 trust in him alone, (e)</p><p>
 with humility (f)</p><p>
 and patience submit to him; (g)</p><p>
 expect all good things from him only; (h)</p><p>
 love, (i)</p><p>
 fear, (j)</p><p>

 so that I renounce and forsake all creatures, rather than commit even the least
 thing contrary to his will. (l)</p><p>

 <b></b>Are images then not at all to be made?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>God neither can, nor may be represented by any means: (a)</p><p>

 God by them. (b)</p><p>

 <b>Q. 98.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>But may not images be tolerated in the churches, as books to the
 laity?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>No:  for we must not pretend to be wiser than God, who will have his
 people taught, not by dumb images, (a)</p><p>

 <b>Q. 99.</b></p><p>

 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>That we, not only by cursing (a)</p><p>

 but also by rash swearing, (c)</p><p>
 must not profane or abuse the name of God;  nor by silence or connivance be
 partakers of these horrible sins in others; (d)</p><p>

 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 100.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Is then the profaning of God's name, by swearing and cursing, so heinous
 a sin, that his wrath is kindled against those who do not endeavour, as much as
 in them lies, to prevent and forbid such cursing and swearing?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>It undoubtedly is, (a)</p><p>
 for there is no sin greater or more provoking to God, than the profaning of his
 name;  and therefore he has commanded this sin to be punished with death. (b)</p><p>

 <p>
 <b>Q. 101.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>May we then swear religiously by the name of God?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Yes:  either when the magistrates demand it of the subjects; or when
 necessity requires us thereby to confirm a fidelity and truth to the glory of
 God, and the safety of our neighbour: for such an oath is founded on God's

 <b>Q. 102.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>May we also swear by saints or any other creatures?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>No;  for a lawful oath is calling upon God, as the only one who knows
 the heart, that he will bear witness to the truth, and punish me if I swear
 falsely; (a)</p><p>
 which honour is due to no creature. (b)</p><p>

 <b></b>That I show all honour, love and fidelity, to my father and mother, and

 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>That neither in thoughts, nor words, nor gestures, much less in deeds, I

 <b>Q. 106.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>But this commandment seems only to speak of murder?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>In forbidding murder, God teaches us, that he abhors the causes thereof,

 <b>Q. 107.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>But is it enough that we do not kill any man in the manner mentioned
 above?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>No:  for when God forbids envy, hatred, and anger, he commands us to
 love our neighbour as ourselves; (a)</p><p>
 to show patience, peace, meekness, mercy, and all kindness, towards him, (b)</p><p>

 <b></b>Does God forbid in this commandment, only adultery, and such like gross

 <b></b>What are the requisites of that prayer, which is acceptable to God, and

 (e)</p><p>
 thirdly, that we be fully persuaded that he, notwithstanding that we are
 unworthy of it, will, for the sake of Christ our Lord, certainly hear our
 prayer, (f)</p><p>

 <p>
 <b>Q. 120.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Why has Christ commanded us to address God thus: "Our Father"?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>That immediately, in the very beginning of our prayer, he might excite
 in us a childlike reverence for, and confidence in God, which are the
 foundation of our prayer:  namely, that God is become our Father in Christ, and
 will much less deny us what we ask of him in true faith, than our parents will
 refuse us earthly things. (a)</p><p>

 (a) Matt.7:9-11; Luke 11:11-13.
 </p><hr><p>
 <b>Q. 121.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Why is it here added, "Which art in heaven"?</p><p>
 <b>A.</b></p><p>
 <b></b>Lest we should form any earthly conceptions of God's heavenly majesty,
 (a)</p><p>
 and that we may expect from his almighty power all things necessary for soul
 and body. (b)</p><p>
