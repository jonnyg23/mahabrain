 <p> </p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER 4</h3>  <h3 align="center">The First Advent of Christ</h3>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Then I was carried down to the time when Jesus was to take upon himself man’s nature, humble himself as a man, and suffer the temptations of Satan.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">            His birth was without worldly grandeur.  He was born in a stable, cradled in a manger; yet his birth was honored far above any of the sons of men.  Angels from heaven informed the shepherds of the advent of Jesus, while the light and glory from God accompanied their testimony.  The heavenly host touched their harps and glorified God.  They triumphantly heralded the advent of the Son of God to a fallen world to accomplish the work of redemption, and by his death bring peace, happiness, and everlasting life to man.  God honored the advent of his Son.  Angels worshiped him.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">            Angels of God hovered over the scene of his baptism, and the Holy Spirit descended in the shape of a dove, and lighted upon him, and as the people stood greatly amazed, with their eyes fastened upon him, the Father’s voice was heard from heaven, saying, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">            John was not certain that it was the Saviour who came to be baptized of him in Jordan.  But God had promised him a sign by which he should know the Lamb of God.  That sign was given as the heavenly Dove rested upon Jesus, and the glory of God shone round about him.  John reached forth his hand, pointing to Jesus, and with a loud voice cried out, Behold the Lamb of God which taketh away the sin of the world.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">            John informed his disciples that Jesus was the promised Messiah, the Saviour of the world.  As his work was closing, he taught his disciples to look to Jesus, and follow him as the great teacher.  John’s life was without pleasure.  It was sorrowful and self-denying.  He heralded the first advent of Christ, and then was not permitted to witness the miracles, and enjoy the power manifested by him.  He knew that when Jesus should establish himself as a teacher, he must die.  His voice was seldom heard, except in the wilderness.  His life was lonely.  He did not cling to his father’s family, to enjoy their society, but left them in order to fulfill his mission.  Multitudes left the busy cities and villages, and flocked to the wilderness to hear the words of the wonderful, singular Prophet.  John laid the axe at the root of the tree.  He reproved sin fearless of consequences, and prepared the way for the Lamb of God.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">            Herod was affected as he listened to the powerful, pointed testimonies of John.  With deep interest he inquired what he must do to become his disciple.  John was acquainted with the fact that he was about to marry his brother’s wife, while her husband was yet living, and faithfully told Herod that it was not lawful.  Herod was not willing to make any sacrifice.  He married his brother’s wife, and, through her influence, seized John and put him in prison.  But Herod intended to release him again.  While there confined, John heard through his disciples of the mighty works of Jesus.  He could not listen to his gracious words.  But the disciples informed him, and comforted him with what they had heard.  Soon John was beheaded through the influence of Herod’s wife. I saw that the least disciple that followed Jesus, witnessed his miracles, and heard the comforting words which fell from his lips, was greater than John the Baptist.  That is, they were more exalted and honored, and had more pleasure in their lives.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">John came in the spirit and power of Elijah, to proclaim the first advent of Jesus.  I was pointed down to the last days, and saw that John was to represent those who should go forth in the spirit and power of Elijah, to herald the day of wrath, and the second advent of Jesus.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">After the baptism of Jesus in Jordan, he was led by the Spirit into the wilderness, to be tempted of the Devil.  The Holy Spirit had fitted him for that special scene of fierce temptations.  Forty days he was tempted of the Devil, and in those days he ate nothing.  Everything around Jesus was unpleasant, from which human nature would be led to shrink.  He was with the wild beasts, and the Devil, in a desolate, lonely place. I saw that the Son of God was pale and emaciated through fasting and suffering.  But his course was marked out, and he must fulfill the work he came to do.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Satan took advantage of the sufferings of the Son of God, and prepared to beset him with manifold temptations, hoping he should obtain the victory over him, because he had humbled himself as a man.  Satan came with this temptation, If thou be the Son of God, command that this stone be made bread.  He tempted Jesus to condescend to him, and give him proof of his being the Messiah, by exercising his divine power.  Jesus mildly answered him, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word of God.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Satan was seeking a dispute with Jesus concerning his being the Son of God.  He referred to his weak, suffering condition, and boastingly affirmed that he was stronger than Jesus.  But the word spoken from heaven, Thou art my beloved Son, in thee I am well pleased, was sufficient to sustain Jesus through all his sufferings.  I saw that in all his mission he had nothing to do in convincing Satan of his power, and of his being the Saviour of the world, Satan had sufficient evidence of his exalted station and authority.  His unwillingness to yield to Jesus’ authority, shut him out of heaven.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Satan, to manifest his strength, carried Jesus to Jerusalem, and set him upon a pinnacle of the temple, and again tempted him, that if he was the Son of God, to give him evidence of it by casting himself down from the dizzy height upon which he had placed him.  Satan came with the words of inspiration.  For it is written, He shall give his angels charge over thee, and in their hands they shall bear thee up, lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.  Jesus answering said unto him, It is said, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God.  Satan wished to cause Jesus to presume upon the mercy of his Father, and risk his life before the fulfillment of his mission.  He had hoped that the plan of salvation would fail; but I saw that the plan was laid too deep to be thus overthrown, or marred by Satan.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">I saw that Christ was the example for all Christians when tempted, or their rights disputed.  They should bear it patiently.  They should not feel that they have a right to call upon God to display his power, that they may obtain a victory over their enemies, unless there is a special object in view, that God can be directly honored and glorified by it. I saw that if Jesus had cast himself from the pinnacle, it would not have glorified his Father; for none would witness the act but Satan, and the angels of God.  And it would be tempting the Lord to display his power to his bitterest foe.  It would have been condescending to the one whom Jesus came to conquer.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">“And the Devil, taking him up into an high mountain, showed unto him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.  And the Devil said unto him, All this power will I give thee, and the glory of them: for that is delivered unto me; and to whomsoever I will I give it.  If thou, therefore, wilt worship me, all shall be thine.  And Jesus answered and said unto him, Get thee behind me, Satan; for it is written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only shalt thou serve.”</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Here Satan showed Jesus the kingdoms of the world.  They were presented in the most attractive light.  He offered them to Jesus if he would there worship him.  He told Jesus that he would relinquish his claims of the possessions of earth.  Satan knew that his power must be limited, and finally taken away, if the plan of salvation should be carried out.  He knew that if Jesus should die to redeem man, his power would end after a season, and he would be destroyed.  Therefore it was his studied plan to prevent, if possible, the completion of the great work which had been commenced by the Son of God.  If the plan of man’s redemption should fail, he would retain the kingdom which he then claimed.  And if he should succeed, he flattered himself that he would reign in opposition to the God of heaven.</p>  
 <p align="justify;text-indent:35.5pt;mso-pagination:">Satan exulted when Jesus left heaven, and left his power and glory there.  He thought that the Son of God was placed in his power.  The temptation took so easily with the holy pair in Eden, that he hoped he could with his satanic cunning and power overthrow even the Son of God, and thereby save his life and kingdom.  If he could tempt Jesus to depart from the will of his Father, then his object would be gained.  Jesus bid Satan get behind him.  He was to bow only to his Father.  The time was to come when Jesus should redeem the possessions of Satan by his own life, and, after a season, all in heaven and earth should submit to him.  Satan claimed the kingdoms of earth as his, and he insinuated to Jesus that all his suffering might be saved.  He need not die to obtain the kingdoms of this world.  But he might have the entire possessions of earth, and the glory of reigning over them, if he would worship him.  Jesus was steadfast.  He chose his life of suffering, his dreadful death, and, in the way appointed by his Father, to become a lawful heir to the kingdoms of earth, and have them given into his hands as an everlasting possession.  Satan also will be given into his hands to be destroyed by death, never more to annoy Jesus, or the saints in glory.  </p>
