 <h1 align="CENTER">Respecting The Reformation Of The Christian Estate<br>(Part I)</h1>
 <pre>
 
      Now though I am too lowly to submit articles that could serve for the
 reformation of these fearful evils, I will yet sing out my fool's song, and
 will show, as well as my wit will allow, what might and should be done by the
 temporal authorities or by a general council.
 
 
      1. Princes, nobles, and cities should promptly forbid their subjects
 to pay the annates to Rome and should even abolish them altogether. For the
 Pope has broken the compact, and turned the annates into robbery for the harm
 and shame of the German nation; he gives them to his friends; he sells them
 for large sums of money and founds benefices on them. Therefore he has
 forfeited his right to them, and deserves punishment. In this way the temporal
 power should protect the innocent and prevent wrong-doing, as we are taught
 by St. Paul (Rom. xiii.) and by St. Peter (1 Peter ii.) and even by the canon
 law (16. q. 7. de Filiis). That is why we say to the Pope and his followers,
 Tu ora! "Thou shalt pray"; to the Emperor and his followers, Tu protege! "Thou
 shalt protect"; to the commons, Tu labora! "Thou shalt work." Not that each
 man should not pray, protect, and work; for if a man fulfils his duty, that
 is prayer, protection, and work; but every man must have his proper task.
 
 
      2. Since by means of those Romish tricks, commendams, coadjutors,
 reservations, expectations, pope's months, incorporations, unions, Palls,
 rules of chancellery, and other such knaveries, the Pope takes unlawful
 possession of all German foundations, to give and sell them to strangers at
 Rome, that profit Germany in no way, so that the incumbents are robbed of
 their rights, and the bishops are made mere ciphers and anointed idols; and
 thus, besides natural justice and reason, the Pope's own canon law is
 violated; and things have come to such a pass that prebends and benefices
 are sold at Rome to vulgar, ignorant asses and knaves, out of sheer greed,
 while pious learned men have no profit by their merit and skill, whereby
 the unfortunate German people must needs lack good, learned prelates and
 suffer ruin-on account of these evils the Christian nobility should rise up
 against the Pope as a common enemy and destroyer of Christianity, for the sake
 of the salvation of the poor souls that such tyranny must ruin. They should
 ordain, order, and decree that henceforth no benefice shall be drawn away to
 Rome, and that no benefice shall be claimed there in any fashion whatsoever;
 and after having once got these benefices out of the hands of Romish tyranny,
 they must be kept from them, and their lawful incumbents must be reinstated
 in them to administer them as best they may within the German nation. And if
 a courtling came from Rome, he should receive the strict command to withdraw,
 or to leap into the Rhine, or whatever river be nearest, and to administer
 a cold bath to the Interdict, seal and letters and all. Thus those at Rome
 would learn that we Germans are not to remain drunken fools forever, but that
 we, too, are become Christians, and that as such we will no longer suffer this
 shameful mockery of Christ's holy name, that serves as a cloak for such
 knavery and destruction of souls, and that we shall respect God and the glory
 of God more than the power of men.
 
 
      3. It should be decreed by an imperial law that no episcopal cloak and
 no confirmation of any appointment shall for the future be obtained from Rome.
 The order of the most holy and renowned Nicene Council must again be restored,
 namely that a bishop must be confirmed by the two nearest bilhops or by the
 archbishop. If the Pope cancels the decrees of these and all other councils,
 what is the good of councils at all? Who has given him the right thus to
 despise councils and to cancel them? If this is allowed, we had better abolish
 all bishops, archbishops and primates, and make simple rectors of all of them,
 so that they would have the Pope alone over them as is indeed the case now; he
 deprives bishops, archbishops, and primates of all the authority of their
 office, taking everything to himself, and leaving them only the name and the
 empty title; more than this, by his exemption he has withdrawn convents,
 abbots, and prelates from the ordinary authority of the bishops, so that there
 remains no order in Christendom. The necessary result of this must be, and has
 been, laxity in punishing and such a liberty to do evil in all the world that
 I very much fear one might call the Pope "the man of sin" (2 Thess. ii. 3).
 Who but the Pope is to blame for this absence of all order, of all punishment,
 of all government, of all discipline, in Christendom? By his own arbitrary
 power he ties the hands of all his prelates, and takes from them their rods,
 while all their subjects have their hands unloosed, and obtain licence by gift
 or purchase.
 
 
      But, that he have no cause for complaint, as being deprived of his
 authority, it should be decreed that in cases where the primates and
 archbishops are unable to settle the matter, or where there is a dispute
 among them, the matters shall then be submitted to the Pope, but not every
 little matter, as was done formerly, and was ordered by the most renowned
 Nicene Council. His Holiness must not be troubled with small matters, that
 can be settled without his help; so that he may have leisure to devote himself
 to his prayers and study and to his care of all Christendom, as he professes
 to do, as indeed the Apostles did, saying, "It is not reason that we should
 leave the word of God, and serve tables.... But we will give ourselves
 continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word" (Acts vi. 2, 4). But
 now we see at Rome nothing but contempt of the Gospel and of prayer, and the
 service of tables, that is the service of the goods of this world; and the
 government of the Pope agrees with the government of the Apostles as well as
 Lucifer with Christ, hell with heaven, night with day; and yet he calls
 himself Christ's vicar and the successor of the Apostles.
 
 
      4. Let it be decreed that no temporal matter shall be submitted to Rome,
 but all shall be left to the jurisdiction of the temporal authorities. This
 is part of their own canon law, though they do not obey it. For this should
 be the Pope's office: that he, the most learned in the Scriptures and the
 most holy, not in name only, but in fact, should rule in matters concerning
 the faith and the holy life of Christians; he should make primates and
 bishops attend to this, and should work and take thought with them to this
 end, as St. Paul teaches (1 Cor. vi.), severely upbraiding those that occupy
 themselves with the things of this world. For all countries suffer unbearable
 damage by this practice of settling such matters at Rome, since it involves
 great expense; and besides this, the judges at Rome, not knowing the manners,
 laws, and customs of other countries, frequently pervert the matter according
 to their own laws and their own opinions, thus causing injustice to all
 parties. Besides this, we should prohibit in all foundations the grievous
 extortion of the ecclesiastical judges; they should only be allowed to
 consider matters concerning faith and good morals; but matters concerning
 money, property, life, and honour should be left to temporal judges.
 Therefore, the temporal authorities should not permit excommunication or
 expulsion except in matters of faith and righteous living. It is only
 reasonable that spiritual authorities should have power in spiritual matters;
 spiritual matters, however, are not money or matters relating to the body,
 but faith and good works.
 
 
      Still we might allow matters respecting benefices or prebends to be
 treated before bishops, archbishops, and primates. Therefore when it is
 necessary to decide quarrels and strifes let the Primate of Germany hold a
 general consistory, with assessors and chancellors, who would have the control
 over the signaturas gratiae and justitiae [18] and to whom matters arising in
 Germany might be submitted by appeal. The officers of such court should be
 paid out of the annates, or in some other way, and should not have to draw
 their salaries, as at Rome, from chance presents and offerings, whereby they
 grow accustomed to sell justice and injustice, as they must needs do at Rome,
 where the Pope gives them no salary, but allows them to fatten themselves on
 presents; for at Rome no one heeds what is right or what is wrong, but only
 what is money and what is not money. They might be paid out of the annates, or
 by some other means devised by men of higher understanding and of more
 experience in these things than I have. I am content with making these
 suggestions and giving some materials for consideration to those who may be
 able and willing to help the German nation to become a free people of
 Christians, after this wretched, heathen, unchristian misrule of the Pope.
 
 
 [18: At the time when the above was written the function of the
 signatura gratiae was to superintend the conferring of grants, concessions,
 favours, etc., whilst the signatura justitiae embraced the general
 administration of ecclesiastical matters.]
 
 
      5. Henceforth no reservations shall be valid, and no benefices shall be
 appropriated by Rome, whether the incumbent die there, or there be a dispute,
 or the incumbent be a servant of the Pope or of a cardinal; and all courtiers
 shall be strictly prohibited and prevented from causing a dispute about any
 benefice, so as to cite the pious priests, to trouble them, and to drive them
 to pay compensation. And if in consequence of this there comes an interdict
 from Rome, let it be despised, just as if a thief were to excommunicate any
 man because he would not allow him to steal in peace. Nay, they should be
 punished most severely for making such a blasphemous use of excommunication
 and of the name of God, to support their robberies, and for wishing by their
 false threats to drive us to suffer and approve this blasphemy of God's name
 and this abuse of Christian authority, and thus to become sharers before God
 in their wrong-doing, whereas it is our duty before God to punish it, as St.
 Paul (Rom. i.) upbraids the Romans for not only doing wrong, but allowing
 wrong to be done. But above all that lying mental reservation (pectoralis
 reservatio) is unbearable, by which Christendom is so openly mocked and
 insulted, in that its head notoriously deals with lies, and impudently cheats
 and fools every man for the sake of accursed wealth.
 
 
      6. The cases reserved [19] (casus reservati) should be abolished, by which
 not only are the people cheated out of much money, but besides many poor
 consciences are confused and led into error by the ruthless tyrants, to the
 intolerable harm of their faith in God, especially those foolish and childish
 cases that are made important by the bull In Coena Domini, [20] and which do
 not deserve the name of daily sins, not to mention those great cases for which
 the Pope gives no absolution, such as preventing a pilgrim from going to Rome,
 furnishing the Turks with arms, or forging the Pope's letters. They only fool
 us with these gross, mad, and clumsy matters: Sodom and Gomorrah, and all sins
 that are committed and that can be committed against God's commandments, are
 not reserved cases; but what God never commanded and they themselves have
 invented - these must be made reserved cases, solely in order that none may be
 prevented from bringing money to Rome, that they may live in their lust
 without fear of the Turk, and may keep the world in their bondage by their
 wicked useless bulls and briefs.
 
 
 [19: "Reserved cases" refer to those great sins for which the Pope or
 the bishops only could give absolution.]
 
 
 [20: The celebrated papal bull known under the name of In Coena
 Domini, containing anathemas and excommunications against all those who
 dissented in any way from the Roman Catholic creed, used until the year 1770
 to be read publicly at Rome on Maundy Thursday.]
 
 
      Now all priests ought to know, or rather it should be a public ordinance,
 that no secret sin constitutes a reserved case, if there be no public
 accusation; and that every priest has power to absolve from all sin, whatever
 its name, if it be secret, and that no abbot, bishop, or pope has power to
 reserve any such case; and, lastly, that if they do this, it is null and void,
 and they should, moreover, be punished as interfering without authority in
 God's judgment and confusing and troubling without cause our poor witless
 consciences. But in respect to any great open sin, directly contrary to God's
 commandments, there is some reason for a "reserved case"; but there should not
 be too many, nor should they be reserved arbitrarily without due cause. For
 God has not ordained tyrants, but shepherds, in His Church, as St. Peter says
 (1 Peter v. 2).
 
 
      7. The Roman See must abolish the papal offices, and diminish that crowd
 of crawling vermin at Rome, so that the Pope's servants may be supported out
 of the Pope's own pocket, and that his court may cease to surpass all royal
 courts in its pomp and extravagance; seeing that all this pomp has not only
 been of no service to the Christian faith, but has also kept them from study
 and prayer, so that they themselves know hardly anything concerning matters of
 faith, as they proved clumsily enough at the last Roman Council, [21] where,
 among many childishly trifling matters, they decided "that the soul is
 immortal," and that a priest is bound to pray once every month on pain of
 losing his benefice. [22] How are men to rule Christendom and to decide matters
 of faith who, callous and blinded by their greed, wealth, and worldly pomp,
 have only just decided that the soul is immortal? It is no slight shame to all
 Christendom that they should deal thus scandalously with the faith at Rome. If
 they had less wealth and lived in less pomp, they might be better able to
 study and pray that they might become able and worthy to treat matters of
 belief, as they were once, when they were content to be bishops, and not kings
 of kings.
 
 
 [21: The council alluded to above was held at Rome from 1512 to
 1517.]
 
 
 [22: Luther's objection is not, of course, to the recognition of the
 immortality of the soul; what he objects to is (1) that it was thought
 necessary for a council to decree that the soul is immortal, and (2) that this
 question was put on a level with trivial matters of discipline.]
 
 
      8. The terrible oaths must be abolished which bishops are forced, without
 any right, to swear to the Pope, by which they are bound like servants, and
 which are arbitrarily and foolishly decreed in the absurd and shallow chapter
 Significasti. [23] Is it not enough that they oppress us in goods, body, and
 soul by all their mad laws, by which they have weakened faith and destroyed
 Christianity; but must they now take possession of the very persons of
 bishops, with their offices and functions, and also claim the investiture [24]
 which used formerly to be the right of the German emperors, and is still the
 right of the King in France and other kingdoms? This matter caused many wars
 and disputes with the emperors until the popes impudently took the power by
 force, since which time they have retained it, just as if it were only right
 for the Germans, above all Christians on earth, to be the fools of the Pope
 and the Holy See, and to do and suffer what no one beside would suffer or do.
 Seeing then that this is mere arbitrary power, robbery, and a hindrance to the
 exercise of the bishop's ordinary power, and to the injury of poor souls,
 therefore it is the duty of the Emperor and his nobles to prevent and punish
 this tyranny.
 
 
 [23: The above is the title of a chapter in the Corpus Juris
 Canonici.]
 
 
 [24: The right of investiture was the subject of the dispute between
 Gregory VII. and Henry IV., which led to the Emperor's submission at Canossa.]
 
 
      9. The Pope should have no power over the Emperor, except to anoint and
 crown him at the altar, as a bishop crowns a king; nor should that devilish
 pomp be allowed that the Emperor should kiss the Pope's feet or sit at his
 feet, or, as it is said, hold his stirrup or the reins of his mule, when he
 mounts to ride; much less should he pay homage to the Pope, or swear
 allegiance, as is impudently demanded by the popes, as if they had a right to
 it. The chapter Solite, [25] in which the papal authority is exalted above the
 imperial, is not worth a farthing, and so of all those that depend on it or
 fear it; for it does nothing but pervert God's holy words from their true
 meaning, according to their own imaginations, as I have proved in a Latin
 treatise.
 
 
 [25: The chapter Solite is also contained in the Corpus Juris
 Canonici.]
 
 
      All these excessive, over-presumptuous, and most wicked claims of the
 Pope are the invention of the devil, with the object of bringing in antichrist
 in due course and of raising the Pope above God, as indeed many have done and
 are now doing. It is not meet that the Pope should exalt himself above
 temporal authority, except in spiritual matters, such as preaching and
 absolution; in other matters he should be subject to it, according to the
 teaching of St. Paul (Rom. xiii.) and St. Peter (I Peter iii.), as I have said
 above. He is not the vicar of Christ in heaven, but only of Christ upon earth.
 For Christ in heaven, in the form of a ruler, requires no vicar, but there
 sits, sees, does, knows, and commands all things. But He requires him "in the
 form of a servant" to represent Him as He walked upon earth, working,
 preaching, suffering, and dying. But they reverse this: they take from Christ
 His power as a heavenly Ruler, and give it to the Pope, and allow "the form of
 a servant" to be entirely forgotten (Phil. ii. 7). He should properly be
 called the counter-Christ, whom the Scriptures call antichrist; for his whole
 existence, work, and proceedings are directed against Christ, to ruin and
 destroy the existence and will of Christ.
 
 
      It is also absurd and puerile for the Pope to boast for such blind,
 foolish reasons, in his decretal Pastoralis, that he is the rightful heir to
 the empire, if the throne be vacant. Who gave it to him? Did Christ do so when
 He said, "The kings of the Gentiles exercise lordship over them, but ye shall
 not do so" (Luke xxii. 25, 26)? Did St. Peter bequeath it to him? It disgusts
 me that we have to read and teach such impudent, clumsy, foolish lies in the
 canon law, and, moreover, to take them for Christian doctrine, while in
 reality they are mere devilish lies. Of this kind also is the unheard-of lie
 touching the "donation of Constantine." [26] It must have been a plague sent by
 God that induced so many wise people to accept such lies, though they are so
 gross and clumsy that one would think a drunken boor could lie more skilfully.
 How could preaching, prayer, study, and the care of the poor consist with the
 government of the empire? These are the true offices of the Pope, which Christ
 imposed with such insistence that He forbade them to take either coat or scrip
 (Matt. x. 10), for he that has to govern a single house can hardly perform
 these duties. Yet the Pope wishes to rule an empire and to remain a pope. This
 is the invention of the knaves that would fain become lords of the world in
 the Pope's name, and set up again the old Roman empire, as it was formerly, by
 means of the Pope and name of Christ, in its former condition.
 
 
 [26: In order to legalize the secular power of the Pope, the fiction
 was invented during the latter part of the eighth century, that Constantine
 the Great had made over to the popes the dominion over Rome and over the whole
 of Italy.]
 
 
      10. The Pope must withdraw his hand from the dish, and on no pretence
 assume royal authority over Naples and Sicily. He has no more right to them
 than I, and yet claims to be the lord-their liege lord. They have been taken
 by force and robbery, like almost all his other possessions. Therefore the
 Emperor should grant him no such fief, nor any longer allow him those he has,
 but direct him instead to his Bibles and Prayer-books, so that he may leave
 the government of countries and peoples to the temporal power, especially of
 those that no one has given him. Let him rather preach and pray! The same
 should be done with Bologna, Imola, Vicenza, Ravenna, and whatever the Pope
 has taken by force and holds without right in the Ancontine territory, in the
 Romagna, and other parts of Italy, interfering in their affairs against all
 the commandments of Christ and St. Paul. For St. Paul says "that he that would
 be one of the soldiers of heaven must not entangle himself in the affairs of
 this life" (2 Tim. ii. 4). Now the Pope should be the head and the leader of
 the soldiers of heaven, and yet he engages more in worldly matters than any
 king or emperor. He should be relieved of his worldly cares and allowed to
 attend to his duties as a soldier of heaven. Christ also, whose vicar he
 claims to be, would have nothing to do with the things of this world, and even
 asked one that desired of Him a judgment concerning his brother, "Who made Me
 a judge over you?" (St. Luke xii. 14). But the Pope interferes in these
 matters unasked, and concerns himself with all matters, as though he were a
 god, until he himself has forgotten what this Christ is whose vicar he
 professes to be.
 
 
      11. The custom of kissing the Pope's feet must cease. It is an
 unchristian, or rather an anti-Christian, example that a poor sinful man
 should suffer his feet to be kissed by one who is a hundred times better than
 he. If it is done in honour of his power, why does he not do it to others in
 honour of their holiness? Compare them together: Christ and the Pope. Christ
 washed His disciples' feet and dried them, and the disciples never washed His.
 The Pope, pretending to be higher than Christ, inverts this, and considers it
 a great favour to let us kiss his feet; whereas, if any one wished to do so,
 he ought to do his utmost to prevent him, as St. Paul and Barnabas would not
 suffer themselves to be worshipped as gods by the men at Lystra, saying, "We
 also are men of like passions with you" (Acts xiv. 14 seq.). But our
 flatterers have brought things to such a pitch that they have set up an idol
 for us, until no one regards God with such fear or honours Him with such marks
 of reverence as he does the Pope. This they can suffer, but not that the
 Pope's glory should be diminished a single hair's-breadth. Now if they were
 Christians and preferred God's honour to their own, the Pope would never be
 pleased to have God's honour despised and his own exalted, nor would he allow
 any to honour him until he found that God's honour was again exalted above his
 own.
 
 
      It is of a piece with this revolting pride that the Pope is not satisfied
 with riding on horseback or in a carriage, but though he be hale and strong,
 is carried by men, like an idol in unheard-of pomp. My friend, how does this
 Lucifer-like pride agree with the example of Christ, who went on foot, as did
 also all His Apostles? Where has there been a king who has ridden in such
 worldly pomp as he does, who professes to be the head of all whose duty it is
 to despise and flee from all worldly pomp-I mean, of all Christians? Not that
 this need concern us for his own sake, but that we have good reason to fear
 God's wrath, if we flatter such pride and do not show our discontent. It is
 enough that the Pope should be so mad and foolish; but it is too much that we
 should sanction and approve it.
 
 
      For what Christian heart can be pleased at seeing the Pope when he
 communicates, sit still like a gracious lord and have the Sacrament handed to
 him on a golden reed by a cardinal bending on his knees before him? Just as if
 the Holy Sacrament were not worthy that a pope, a poor miserable sinner,
 should stand to do honour to his God, although all other Christians, who are
 much more holy than the Most Holy Father, receive it with all reverence! Could
 we be surprised if God visited us all with a plague for that we suffer such
 dishonour to be done to God by our prelates, and approve it, becoming partners
 of the Pope's damnable pride by our silence or flattery? It is the same when
 he carries the Sacrament in procession. He must be carried, but the Sacrament
 stands before him like a cup of wine on a table. In short, at Rome Christ is
 nothing, the Pope is everything; yet they urge us and threaten us, to make us
 suffer and approve and honour this anti-Christian scandal, contrary to God and
 all Christian doctrine. Now may God so help a free council that it may teach
 the Pope that he too is a man, not above God, as he makes himself out to be.
 
 
      12. Pilgrimages to Rome must be abolished, or at least no one must be
 allowed to go from his own wish or his own piety, unless his priest, his town
 magistrate, or his lord has found that there is sufficient reason for his
 pilgrimage. This I say, not because pilgrimages are bad in themselves, but
 because at the present time they lead to mischief; for at Rome a pilgrim sees
 no good examples, but only offence. They themselves have made a proverb, "The
 nearer to Rome, the farther from Christ," and accordingly men bring home
 contempt of God and of God's commandments. It is said, "The first time one
 goes to Rome, he goes to seek a rogue; the second time he finds him; the third
 time he brings him home with him." But now they have become so skilful that
 they can do their three journeys in one, and they have, in fact, brought home
 from Rome this saying: "It were better never to have seen or heard of Rome."
 
 
      And even if this were not so, there is something of more importance to be
 considered; namely, that simple men are thus led into a false delusion and a
 wrong understanding of God's commandments. For they think that these
 pilgrimages are precious and good works; but this is not true. It is but a
 little good work, often a bad, misleading work, for God has not commanded it.
 But He has commanded that each man should care for his wife and children and
 whatever concerns the married state, and should, besides, serve and help his
 neighbour. Now it often happens that one goes on a pilgrimage to Rome, spends
 fifty or one hundred guilders more or less, which no one has commanded him,
 while his wife and children, or those dearest to him, are left at home in want
 and misery; and yet he thinks, poor foolish man, to atone for this
 disobedience and contempt of God's commandments by his self-willed pilgrimage,
 while he is in truth misled by idle curiosity or the wiles of the devil. This
 the popes have encouraged with their false and foolish invention of Golden
 Years, [27] by which they have incited the people, have torn them away from
 God's commandments and turned them to their own delusive proceedings, and set
 up the very thing that they ought to have forbidden. But it brought them money
 and strengthened their false authority, and therefore it was allowed to
 continue, though against God's will and the salvation of souls.
 
 
 [27: The Jubilees, during which plenary indulgences were granted to
 those who visited the churches of St. Peter and St. Paul at Rome, were
 originally celebrated every hundred years and subsequently every twenty-five
 years. Those who were unable to go to Rome in person could obtain the plenary
 indulgences by paying the expenses of the journey to Rome into the papal
 treasury.]
 
 
      That this false, misleading belief on the part of simple Christians may
 be destroyed, and a true opinion of good works may again be introduced, all
 pilgrimages should be done away with. For there is no good in them, no
 commandment, but countless causes of sin and of contempt of God's
 commandments. These pilgrimages are the reason for there being so many
 beggars, who commit numberless villainies, learn to beg without need and get
 accustomed to it. Hence arises a vagabond life, besides other miseries which I
 cannot dwell on now. If any one wishes to go on a pilgrimage or to make a vow
 for a pilgrimage, he should first inform his priest or the temporal
 authorities of the reason, and if it should turn out that he wishes to do it
 for the sake of good works, let this vow and work be just trampled upon by the
 priest or the temporal authority as an infernal delusion, and let them tell
 him to spend his money and the labour a pilgrimage would cost on God's
 commandments and on a thousandfold better work, namely, on his family and his
 poor neighbours. But if he does it out of curiosity, to see cities and
 countries, he may be allowed to do so. If he have vowed it in sickness, let
 such vows be prohibited, and let God's commandments be insisted upon in
 contrast to them; so that a man may be content with what he vowed in baptism,
 namely, to keep God's commandments. Yet for this once he may be suffered, for
 a quiet conscience' sake, to keep his silly vow. No one is content to walk on
 the broad high-road of God's commandments; every one makes for himself new
 roads and new vows, as if he had kept all God's commandments.
 
 
      13. Now we come to the great crowd that promises much and performs
 little. Be not angry, my good sirs; I mean well. I have to tell you this
 bitter and sweet truth: Let no more mendicant monasteries be built! God help
 us! there are too many as it is. Would to God they were all abolished, or at
 least made over to two or three orders! It has never done good, it will never
 do good, to go wandering about over the country. Therefore my advice is that
 ten, or as many as may be required, be put together and made into one, which
 one, sufficiently provided for, need not beg. Oh! it is of much more
 importance to consider what is necessary for the salvation of the common
 people, than what St. Francis, or St. Dominic, or St. Augustine, [28] or any
 other man, laid down, especially since things have not turned out as they
 expected. They should also be relieved from preaching and confession, unless
 specially required to do so by bishops, priests, the congregation, or other
 authority. For their preaching and confession has led toGnought but mere
 hatred and envy between priests and monks, to the great offence and hindrance
 of the people, so that it well deserves to be put a stop to, since its place
 may very well be dispensed with. It does not look at all improbable that the
 Holy Roman See had its own reasons for encouraging all this crowd of monks:
 the Pope perhaps feared that priests and bishops, growing weary of his
 tyranny, might become too strong for him, and begin a reformation unendurable
 to his Holiness.
 
 
 [28: The above-mentioned saints were the patrons of the well-known
 mendicant orders: Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustines.]
 
 
      Besides this, one should also do away with the sections and the divisions
 in the same order which, caused for little reason and kept up for less, oppose
 each other with unspeakable hatred and malice, the result being that the
 Christian faith, which is very well able to stand without their divisions, is
 lost on both sides, and that a true Christian life is sought and judged only
 by outward rules, works, and practices, from which arise only hypocrisy and
 the destruction of souls, as every one can see for himself. Moreover, the Pope
 should be forbidden to institute or to confirm the institution of such new
 orders; nay, he should be commanded to abolish several and to lessen their
 number. For the faith of Christ, which alone is the important matter, and can
 stand without any particular order, incurs no little danger lest men should be
 led away by these diverse works and manners rather to live for such works and
 practices than to care for faith; and unless there are wise prelates in the
 monasteries, who preach and urge faith rather than the rule of the order, it
 is inevitable that the order should be injurious and misleading to simple
 souls, who have regard to works alone.
 
 
      Now, in our own time all the prelates are dead that had faith and founded
 orders, just as it was in old days with the children of Israel: when their
 fathers were dead, that had seen God's works and miracles, their children, out
 of ignorance of God's work and of faith, soon began to set up idolatry and
 their own human works. In the same way, alas! these orders, not understanding
 God's works and faith, grievously labour and torment themselves by their own
 laws and practices, and yet never arrive at a true understanding of a
 spiritual and good life, as was foretold by the Apostle, saying of them,
 "Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof, . . . ever
 learning, and never able to come to the knowledge" of what a true spiritual
 life is (2 Tim. iii. 2-7). Better to have no convents which are governed by a
 spiritual prelate, having no understanding of Christian faith to govern them;
 for such a prelate cannot but rule with injury and harm, and the greater the
 apparent holiness of his life in external works, the greater the harm.
 
 
      It would be, I think, necessary, especially in these perilous times, that
 foundations and convents should again be organised as they were in the time of
 the Apostles and a long time after, namely when they were all free for every
 man to remain there as long as he wished. For what were they but Christian
 schools, in which the Scriptures and Christian life were taught, and where
 folk were trained to govern and to preach? as we read that St. Agnes went to
 school, and as we see even now in some nunneries, as at Quedlinburg and other
 places. Truly all foundations and convents ought to be free in this way: that
 they may serve God of a free will, and not as slaves. But now they have been
 bound round with vows and turned into eternal prisons, so that these vows are
 regarded even more than the vows of baptism. But what fruit has come of this
 we daily see, hear, read, and learn more and more.
 
 
      I dare say that this my counsel will be thought very foolish, but I care
 not for this. I advise what I think best, reject it who will. I know how these
 vows are kept, especially that of chastity, which is so general in all these
 convents. [29] and yet was not ordered by Christ, and it is given to
 comparatively few to be able to keep it, as He says, and St. Paul also (Col.
 ii. 20). I wish all to be helped, and that Christian souls should not be held
 in bondage, through customs and laws invented by men.
