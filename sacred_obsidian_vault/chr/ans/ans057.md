 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Works of St. Anselm</i>, tr. by Sidney Norton Deane, [1903], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <a name="v.XXIV"></a> 		  <h3 align="center"><a name="v.XXIV-p0.1"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h3>   		  
 <p><a name="v.XXIV-p1"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.XXIV-p2"></a>How it is better understood to exist <a name="v.XXIV-p2.1"></a>always than at <a name="v.XXIV-p2.2"></a>every time.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XXIV-p3"></a>  		  
 </p><p><a name="v.XXIV-p4"></a>IT is also evident that this supreme Substance is without beginning and without end; that it has neither <a name="page_82"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 82</font></a> <a name="v.XXIV-Page_82"></a>past, nor future, nor the temporal, that is, transient present in which we live; since its age, or eternity, which is nothing else than itself, is immutable and without parts. Is not, therefore, the term which seems to mean <i>all time</i> more properly understood, when applied to this Substance, to signify eternity, which is never unlike itself, rather than a 			 changing succession of times, which is ever in some sort unlike itself?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XXIV-p5"></a>Hence, if this Being is said to exist always; since, for it, it is the same to exist and to live, no better sense can be attached to this statement, than that it exists or lives eternally, that is, it possesses interminable life, as a perfect whole at once. For its eternity apparently is an interminable life, existing at once as a perfect whole.</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XXIV-p6"></a>For, since it has already been shown that this Substance is nothing else than its own life and its own eternity, is in no wise terminable, and does not exist, except as at once and perfectly whole, what else is true eternity, which is consistent with the nature of that Substance alone, than an interminable life, existing as at once and perfectly whole?</p>  		  
 <p><a name="v.XXIV-p7"></a>For this truth is, at any rate, clearly perceived from the single fact that true eternity belongs only to that substance which alone, as we have proved, was not created, but is the creator, since true eternity is conceived to be free from the limitations of beginning and end; and this is proved to be consistent with the nature of no created being, from the very fact that all such have been created from nothing.</p>
