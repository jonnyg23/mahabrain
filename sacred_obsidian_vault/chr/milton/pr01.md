 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Paradise Lost and Regained</i>, by John Milton, [1667 and 1671], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h1 align="center">PARADISE REGAINED</h1>  <h3 align="center">The First Book</h3>  
 <p>I, who erewhile the happy Garden sung<br> By one man's disobedience lost, now sing<br> Recovered Paradise to all mankind,<br> By one man's firm obedience fully tried<br> Through all temptation, and the Tempter foiled<br> In all his wiles, defeated and repulsed,<br> And Eden raised in the waste Wilderness.</p>  
 <p>Thou Spirit, who ledst this glorious Eremite<br> Into the desert, his victorious field<br> Against the spiritual foe, and brought'st him thence<br> By proof the undoubted Son of God, inspire,<br> As thou art wont, my prompted song, else mute,<br> And bear through highth or depth of Nature's bounds,<br> With prosperous wing full summed, to tell of deeds<br> Above heroic, though in secret done,<br> And unrecorded left through many an age:<br> Worthy to have not remained so long unsung.</p>  
 <p>Now had the great Proclaimer, with a voice<br> More awful than the sound of trumpet, cried<br> Repentance, and Heaven's kingdom night at hand<br> To all baptized. To his great baptism flocked<br> With awe the regions round, and with them came<br> From Nazareth the son of Joseph deemed<br> To the flood Jordan-came as then obscure,<br> Unmarked, unknown. But him the Baptist soon<br> Descried, divinely warned, and witness bore<br> As to his worthier, and would have resigned<br> To him his heavenly office. Nor was long<br> His witness unconfirmed: on him baptized<br> Heaven opened, and in likeness of a Dove<br> The Spirit descended, while the Father's voice<br> From Heaven pronounced him his beloved Son.<br> That heard the Adversary, who, roving still<br> About the world, at that assembly famed<br> Would not be last, and, with the voice divine<br> Nigh thunder-struck, the exalted man to whom<br> Such high attest was given a while surveyed<br> With wonder; then, with envy fraught and rage,<br> Flies to his place, nor rests, but in mid air<br> To council summons all his mighty Peers,<br> Within thick clouds and dark tenfold involved,<br> A gloomy consistory; and them amidst,<br> With looks aghast and sad, he thus bespake:—</p>  
 <p>"O ancient Powers of Air and this wide World<br> (For much more willingly I mention Air,<br> This our old conquest, than remember Hell,<br> Our hated habitation), well ye know<br> How many ages, as the years of men,<br> This Universe we have possessed, and ruled<br> In manner at our will the affairs of Earth,<br> Since Adam and his facile consort Eve<br> Lost Paradise, deceived by me, though since<br> With dread attending when that fatal wound<br> Shall be inflicted by the seed of Eve<br> Upon my head. Long the decrees of Heaven<br> Delay, for longest time to Him is short;<br> And now, too soon for us, the circling hours<br> This dreaded time have compassed, wherein we<br> Must bide the stroke of that long-threatened wound<br> (At least, if so we can, and by the head<br> Broken be not intended all our power<br> To be infringed, our freedom and our being<br> In this fair empire won of Earth and Air)—<br> For this ill news I bring: The Woman's Seed,<br> Destined to this, is late of woman born.<br> His birth to our just fear gave no small cause;<br> But his growth now to youth's full power, displaying<br> All virtue, grace and wisdom to achieve<br> Things highest, greatest, multiplies my fear.<br> Before him a great Prophet, to proclaim<br> His coming, is sent harbinger, who all<br> Invites, and in the consecrated stream<br> Pretends to wash off sin, and fit them so<br> Purified to receive him pure, or rather<br> To do him honour as their King. All come,<br> And he himself among them was baptized—<br> Not thence to be more pure, but to receive<br> The testimony of Heaven, that who he is<br> Thenceforth the nations may not doubt. I saw<br> The Prophet do him reverence; on him, rising<br> Out of the water, Heaven above the clouds<br> Unfold her crystal doors; thence on his head<br> A perfect Dove descend (whate'er it meant);<br> And out of Heaven the sovraign voice I heard,<br> "This is my Son beloved,-in him am pleased.'<br> His mother, then, is mortal, but his Sire<br> He who obtains the monarchy of Heaven;<br> And what will He not do to advance his Son?<br> His first-begot we know, and sore have felt,<br> When his fierce thunder drove us to the Deep;<br> Who this is we must learn, for Man he seems<br> In all his lineaments, though in his face<br> The glimpses of his Father's glory shine.<br> Ye see our danger on the utmost edge<br> Of hazard, which admits no long debate,<br> But must with something sudden be opposed<br> (Not force, but well-couched fraud, well-woven snares),<br> Ere in the head of nations he appear,<br> Their king, their leader, and supreme on Earth.<br> I, when no other durst, sole undertook<br> The dismal expedition to find out<br> And ruin Adam, and the exploit performed<br> Successfully: a calmer voyage now<br> Will waft me; and the way found prosperous once<br> Induces best to hope of like success."</p>  
 <p>He ended, and his words impression left<br> Of much amazement to the infernal crew,<br> Distracted and surprised with deep dismay<br> At these sad tidings. But no time was then<br> For long indulgence to their fears or grief:<br> Unanimous they all commit the care<br> And management of this main enterprise<br> To him, their great Dictator, whose attempt<br> At first against mankind so well had thrived<br> In Adam's overthrow, and led their march<br> From Hell's deep-vaulted den to dwell in light,<br> Regents, and potentates, and kings, yea gods,<br> Of many a pleasant realm and province wide.<br> So to the coast of Jordan he directs<br> His easy steps, girded with snaky wiles,<br> Where he might likeliest find this new-declared,<br> This man of men, attested Son of God,<br> Temptation and all guile on him to try—<br> So to subvert whom he suspected raised<br> To end his reign on Earth so long enjoyed:<br> But, contrary, unweeting he fulfilled<br> The purposed counsel, pre-ordained and fixed,<br> Of the Most High, who, in full frequence bright<br> Of Angels, thus to Gabriel smiling spake:—</p>  
 <p>"Gabriel, this day, by proof, thou shalt behold,<br> Thou and all Angels conversant on Earth<br> With Man or men's affairs, how I begin<br> To verify that solemn message late,<br> On which I sent thee to the Virgin pure<br> In Galilee, that she should bear a son,<br> Great in renown, and called the Son of God.<br> Then told'st her, doubting how these things could be<br> To her a virgin, that on her should come<br> The Holy Ghosts, and the power of the Highest<br> O'ershadow her. This Man, born and now upgrown,<br> To shew him worthy of his birth divine<br> And high prediction, henceforth I expose<br> To Satan; let him tempt, and now assay<br> His utmost subtlety, because he boasts<br> And vaunts of his great cunning to the throng<br> Of his Apostasy. He might have learnt<br> Less overweening, since he failed in Job,<br> Whose constant perseverance overcame<br> Whate'er his cruel malice could invent.<br> He now shall know I can produce a man,<br> Of female seed, far abler to resist<br> All his solicitations, and at length<br> All his vast force, and drive him back to Hell—<br> Winning by conquest what the first man lost<br> By fallacy surprised. But first I mean<br> To exercise him in the Wilderness;<br> There he shall first lay down the rudiments<br> Of his great warfare, ere I send him forth<br> To conquer Sin and Death, the two grand foes.<br> By humiliation and strong sufferance<br> His weakness shall o'ercome Satanic strength,<br> And all the world, and mass of sinful flesh;<br> That all the Angels and aethereal Powers—<br> They now, and men hereafter-may discern<br> From what consummate virtue I have chose<br> This perfet man, by merit called my Son,<br> To earn salvation for the sons of men."</p>  
 <p>So spake the Eternal Father, and all Heaven<br> Admiring stood a space; then into hymns<br> Burst forth, and in celestial measures moved,<br> Circling the throne and singing, while the hand<br> Sung with the voice, and this the argument:—</p>  
 <p>"Victory and triumph to the Son of God,<br> Now entering his great duel, not of arms<br> But to vanquish by wisdom hellish wiles!<br> The Father knows the Son; therefore secure<br> Ventures his filial virtue, though untried,<br> Against whate'er may tempt, whate'er seduce,<br> Allure, or terrify, or undermine.<br> Be frustrate, all ye stratagems of Hell,<br> And, devilish machinations, come to nought!"</p>  
 <p>So they in Heaven their odes and vigils tuned.<br> Meanwhile the Son of God, who yet some days<br> Lodged in Bethabara, where John baptized,<br> Musing and much revolving in his breast<br> How best the mighty work he might begin<br> Of Saviour to mankind, and which way first<br> Publish his godlike office now mature,<br> One day forth walked alone, the Spirit leading<br> And his deep thoughts, the better to converse<br> With solitude, till, far from track of men,<br> Thought following thought, and step by step led on,<br> He entered now the bordering Desert wild,<br> And, with dark shades and rocks environed round,<br> His holy meditations thus pursued:—</p>  
 <p>"O what a multitude of thoughts at once<br> Awakened in me swarm, while I consider<br> What from within I feel myself, and hear<br> What from without comes often to my ears,<br> Ill sorting with my present state compared!<br> When I was yet a child, no childish play<br> To me was pleasing; all my mind was set<br> Serious to learn and know, and thence to do,<br> What might be public good; myself I thought<br> Born to that end, born to promote all truth,<br> All righteous things. Therefore, above my years,<br> The Law of God I read, and found it sweet;<br> Made it my whole delight, and in it grew<br> To such perfection that, ere yet my age<br> Had measured twice six years, at our great Feast<br> I went into the Temple, there to hear<br> The teachers of our Law, and to propose<br> What might improve my knowledge or their own,<br> And was admired by all. Yet this not all<br> To which my spirit aspired. Victorious deeds<br> Flamed in my heart, heroic acts-one while<br> To rescue Israel from the Roman yoke;<br> Then to subdue and quell, o'er all the earth,<br> Brute violence and proud tyrannic power,<br> Till truth were freed, and equity restored:<br> Yet held it more humane, more heavenly, first<br> By winning words to conquer willing hearts,<br> And make persuasion do the work of fear;<br> At least to try, and teach the erring soul,<br> Not wilfully misdoing, but unware<br> Misled; the stubborn only to subdue.<br> These growing thoughts my mother soon perceiving,<br> By words at times cast forth, inly rejoiced,<br> And said to me apart, 'High are thy thoughts,<br> O Son! but nourish them, and let them soar<br> To what highth sacred virtue and true worth<br> Can raise them, though above example high;<br> By matchless deeds express thy matchless Sire.<br> For know, thou art no son of mortal man;<br> Though men esteem thee low of parentage,<br> Thy Father is the Eternal King who rules<br> All Heaven and Earth, Angels and sons of men<br> A messenger from God foretold thy birth<br> Conceived in me a virgin; he foretold<br> Thou shouldst be great, and sit on David's throne,<br> And of thy kingdom there should be no end.<br> At thy Nativity a glorious quire<br> Of Angels, in the fields of Bethlehem, sung<br> To shepherds, watching at their folds by night,<br> And told them the Messiah now was born,<br> Where they might see him; and to thee they came,<br> Directed to the manger where thou lay'st;<br> For in the inn was left no better room.<br> A Star, not seen before, in heaven appearing,<br> Guided the Wise Men thither from the East,<br> To honour thee with incense, myrrh, and gold;<br> By whose bright course led on they found the place,<br> Affirming it thy star, new-graven in heaven,<br> By which they knew thee King of Israel born.<br> Just Simeon and prophetic Anna, warned<br> By vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake,<br> Before the altar and the vested priest.<br> Like things of thee to all that present stood.'<br> This having heard, straight I again revolved<br> The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ<br> Concerning the Messiah, to our scribes<br> Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake<br> I am-this chiefly, that my way must lie<br> Through many a hard assay, even to the death,<br> Ere I the promised kingdom can attain,<br> Or work redemption for mankind, whose sins'<br> Full weight must be transferred upon my head.<br> Yet, neither thus disheartened or dismayed,<br> The time prefixed I waited; when behold<br> The Baptist (of whose birth I oft had heard,<br> Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come<br> Before Messiah, and his way prepare!<br> I, as all others, to his baptism came,<br> Which I believed was from above; but he<br> Straight knew me, and with loudest voice proclaimed<br> Me him (for it was shewn him so from Heaven)—<br> Me him whose harbinger he was; and first<br> Refused on me baptism to confer,<br> As much his greater, and was hardly won.<br> But, as I rose out of the laving stream,<br> Heaven opened her eternal doors, from whence<br> The Spirit descended on me like a Dove;<br> And last, the sum of all, my Father's voice,<br> Audibly heard from Heaven, pronounced me his,<br> Me his beloved Son, in whom alone<br> He was well pleased: by which I knew the time<br> Now full, that I no more should live obscure,<br> But openly begin, as best becomes<br> The authority which I derived from Heaven.<br> And now by some strong motion I am led<br> Into this wilderness; to what intent<br> I learn not yet. Perhaps I need not know;<br> For what concerns my knowledge God reveals."</p>  
 <p>So spake our Morning Star, then in his rise,<br> And, looking round, on every side beheld<br> A pathless desert, dusk with horrid shades.<br> The way he came, not having marked return,<br> Was difficult, by human steps untrod;<br> And he still on was led, but with such thoughts<br> Accompanied of things past and to come<br> Lodged in his breast as well might recommend<br> Such solitude before choicest society.</p>  
 <p>Full forty days he passed-whether on hill<br> Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night<br> Under the covert of some ancient oak<br> Or ceder to defend him from the dew,<br> Or harboured in one cave, is not revealed;<br> Nor tasted human food, nor hunger felt,<br> Till those days ended; hungered then at last<br> Among wild beasts. They at his sight grew mild,<br> Nor sleeping him nor waking harmed; his walk<br> The fiery serpent fled and noxious worm;<br> The lion and fierce tiger glared aloof.<br> But now an aged man in rural weeds,<br> Following, as seemed, the quest of some stray ewe,<br> Or withered sticks to gather, which might serve<br> Against a winter's day, when winds blow keen,<br> To warm him wet returned from field at eve,<br> He saw approach; who first with curious eye<br> Perused him, then with words thus uttered spake:—</p>  
 <p>"Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place,<br> So far from path or road of men, who pass<br> In troop or caravan, for single none<br> Durst ever, who returned, and dropt not here<br> His carcass, pined with hunger and with drought.<br> I ask the rather, and the more admire,<br> For that to me thou seem'st the man whom late<br> Our new baptizing Prophet at the ford<br> Of Jordan honoured so, and called thee Son<br> Of God. I saw and heard, for we sometimes<br> Who dwell this wild, constrained by want, come forth<br> To town or village nigh (nighest is far),<br> Where aught we hear, and curious are to hear,<br> What happens new; fame also finds us out."</p>  
 <p>To whom the Son of God:—"Who brought me hither<br> Will bring me hence; no other guide I seek."</p>  
 <p>"By miracle he may," replied the swain;<br> 'What other way I see not; for we here<br> Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inured<br> More than the camel, and to drink go far—<br> Men to much misery and hardship born.<br> But, if thou be the Son of God, command<br> That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;<br> So shalt thou save thyself, and us relieve<br> With food, whereof we wretched seldom taste."</p>  
 <p>He ended, and the Son of God replied:—<br> "Think'st thou such force in bread? Is it not written<br> (For I discern thee other than thou seem'st),<br> Man lives not by bread only, but each word<br> Proceeding from the mouth of God, who fed<br> Our fathers here with manna? In the Mount<br> Moses was forty days, nor eat nor drank;<br> And forty days Eliah without food<br> Wandered this barren waste; the same I now.<br> Why dost thou, then, suggest to me distrust,<br> Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?"</p>  
 <p>Whom thus answered the Arch-Fiend, now undisguised:—<br> "'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate<br> Who, leagued with millions more in rash revolt,<br> Kept not my happy station, but was driven<br> With them from bliss to the bottomless Deep—<br> Yet to that hideous place not so confined<br> By rigour unconniving but that oft,<br> Leaving my dolorous prison, I enjoy<br> Large liberty to round this globe of Earth,<br> Or range in the Air; nor from the Heaven of Heavens<br> Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.<br> I came, among the Sons of God, when he<br> Gave up into my hands Uzzean Job,<br> To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;<br> And, when to all his Angels he proposed<br> To draw the proud king Ahab into fraud,<br> That he might fall in Ramoth, they demurring,<br> I undertook that office, and the tongues<br> Of all his flattering prophets glibbed with lies<br> To his destruction, as I had in charge:<br> For what he bids I do. Though I have lost<br> Much lustre of my native brightness, lost<br> To be beloved of God, I have not lost<br> To love, at least contemplate and admire,<br> What I see excellent in good, or fair,<br> Or virtuous; I should so have lost all sense.<br> What can be then less in me than desire<br> To see thee and approach thee, whom I know<br> Declared the Son of God, to hear attent<br> Thy wisdom, and behold thy godlike deeds?<br> Men generally think me much a foe<br> To all mankind. Why should I? they to me<br> Never did wrong or violence. By them<br> I lost not what I lost; rather by them<br> I gained what I have gained, and with them dwell<br> Copartner in these regions of the World,<br> If not disposer-lend them oft my aid,<br> Oft my advice by presages and signs,<br> And answers, oracles, portents, and dreams,<br> Whereby they may direct their future life.<br> Envy, they say, excites me, thus to gain<br> Companions of my misery and woe!<br> At first it may be; but, long since with woe<br> Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof<br> That fellowship in pain divides not smart,<br> Nor lightens aught each man's peculiar load;<br> Small consolation, then, were Man adjoined.<br> This wounds me most (what can it less?) that Man,<br> Man fallen, shall be restored, I never more."</p>  
 <p>To whom our Saviour sternly thus replied:—<br> "Deservedly thou griev'st, composed of lies<br> From the beginning, and in lies wilt end,<br> Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come<br> Into the Heaven of Heavens. Thou com'st indeed,<br> As a poor miserable captive thrall<br> Comes to the place where he before had sat<br> Among the prime in splendour, now deposed,<br> Ejected, emptied, gazed, unpitied, shunned,<br> A spectacle of ruin, or of scorn,<br> To all the host of Heaven. The happy place<br> Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy—<br> Rather inflames thy torment, representing<br> Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable;<br> So never more in Hell than when in Heaven.<br> But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King!<br> Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear<br> Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?<br> What but thy malice moved thee to misdeem<br> Of righteous Job, then cruelly to afflict him<br> With all inflictions? but his patience won.<br> The other service was thy chosen task,<br> To be a liar in four hundred mouths;<br> For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.<br> Yet thou pretend'st to truth! all oracles<br> By thee are given, and what confessed more true<br> Among the nations? That hath been thy craft,<br> By mixing somewhat true to vent more lies.<br> But what have been thy answers? what but dark,<br> Ambiguous, and with double sense deluding,<br> Which they who asked have seldom understood,<br> And, not well understood, as good not known?<br> Who ever, by consulting at thy shrine,<br> Returned the wiser, or the more instruct<br> To fly or follow what concerned him most,<br> And run not sooner to his fatal snare?<br> For God hath justly given the nations up<br> To thy delusions; justly, since they fell<br> Idolatrous. But, when his purpose is<br> Among them to declare his providence,<br> To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,<br> But from him, or his Angels president<br> In every province, who, themselves disdaining<br> To approach thy temples, give thee in command<br> What, to the smallest tittle, thou shalt say<br> To thy adorers? Thou, with trembling fear,<br> Or like a fawning parasite, obey'st;<br> Then to thyself ascrib'st the truth foretold.<br> But this thy glory shall be soon retrenched;<br> No more shalt thou by oracling abuse<br> The Gentiles; henceforth oracles are ceased,<br> And thou no more with pomp and sacrifice<br> Shalt be enquired at Delphos or elsewhere—<br> At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.<br> God hath now sent his living Oracle<br> Into the world to teach his final will,<br> And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell<br> In pious hearts, an inward oracle<br> To all truth requisite for men to know."</p>  
 <p>So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,<br> Though inly stung with anger and disdain,<br> Dissembled, and this answer smooth returned:—</p>  
 <p>"Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,<br> And urged me hard with doings which not will,<br> But misery, hath wrested from me. Where<br> Easily canst thou find one miserable,<br> And not inforced oft-times to part from truth,<br> If it may stand him more in stead to lie,<br> Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?<br> But thou art placed above me; thou art Lord;<br> From thee I can, and must, submiss, endure<br> Check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.<br> Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,<br> Smooth on the tongue discoursed, pleasing to the ear,<br> And tunable as sylvan pipe or song;<br> What wonder, then, if I delight to hear<br> Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire<br> Virtue who follow not her lore. Permit me<br> To hear thee when I come (since no man comes),<br> And talk at least, though I despair to attain.<br> Thy Father, who is holy, wise, and pure,<br> Suffers the hypocrite or atheous priest<br> To tread his sacred courts, and minister<br> About his altar, handling holy things,<br> Praying or vowing, and voutsafed his voice<br> To Balaam reprobate, a prophet yet<br> Inspired: disdain not such access to me."</p>  
 <p>To whom our Saviour, with unaltered brow:—<br> "Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,<br> I bid not, or forbid. Do as thou find'st<br> Permission from above; thou canst not more."</p>  
 <p>He added not; and Satan, bowing low<br> His gray dissimulation, disappeared,<br> Into thin air diffused: for now began<br> Night with her sullen wing to double-shade<br> The desert; fowls in their clay nests were couched;<br> And now wild beasts came forth the woods to roam.</p>
