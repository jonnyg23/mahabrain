 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Paradise Lost and Regained</i>, by John Milton, [1667 and 1671], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr>  <h1 align="center">PARADISE LOST</h1>  <h3 align="center">Eighth Book</h3>  <h3 align="center">The Argument</h3>  
 <p>     Adam inquires concerning celestial motions; is doubtfully answered, and exhorted to search rather things more worthy of knowledge. Adam assents, and, still desirous to detain Raphael, relates to him what he remembered since his own creation-his placing in Paradise; his talk with God concerning solitude and fit society; his first meeting and nuptials with Eve. His discourse with the Angel thereupon; who, after admonitions repeated, departs.</p>  
 <p>The Angel ended, and in Adam's ear<br> So charming left his voice that he a while<br> Thought him still speaking, still stood fixed to hear;<br> Then, as new-waked, thus gratefully replied:—</p>  
 <p>"What thanks sufficient, or what recompense<br> Equal, have I to render thee, divine<br> Historian, who thus largely hast allayed<br> The thirst I had of knowledge, and voutsafed<br> This friendly condescension to relate<br> Things else by me unsearchable-now heard<br> With wonder, but delight, and, as is due,<br> With glory attributed to the high<br> Creator? Something yet of doubt remains,<br> Which only thy solution can resolve.<br> When I behold this goodly frame, this World,<br> Of Heaven and Earth consisting, and compute<br> Their magnitudes-this Earth, a spot, a grain,<br> An atom, with the Firmament compared<br> And all her numbered stars, that seem to rowl<br> Spaces incomprehensible (for such<br> Their distance argues, and their swift return<br> Diurnal) merely to officiate light<br> Round this opacous Earth, this punctual spot,<br> One day and night, in all their vast survey<br> Useless besides-reasoning, I oft admire<br> How Nature, wise and frugal, could commit<br> Such disproportions, with superfluous hand<br> So many nobler bodies to create,<br> Greater so manifold, to this one use,<br> For aught appears, and on their Orbs impose<br> Such restless revolution day by day<br> Repeated, while the sedentary Earth,<br> That better might with far less compass move,<br> Served by more noble than herself, attains<br> Her end without least motion, and receives,<br> As tribute, such a sumless journey brought<br> Of incorporeal speed her warmth and light:<br> Speed, to describe whose swiftness number fails."</p>  
 <p>So spake our Sire, and by his countenance seemed<br> Entering on studious thoughts abstruse; which Eve<br> Perceiving, where, she sat retired in sight,<br> With lowliness majestic from her seat,<br> And grace that won who saw to wish her stay,<br> Rose, and went forth among her fruits and flowers,<br> To visit how they prospered, bud and bloom,<br> Her nursery; they at her coming sprung,<br> And, touched by her fair tendance, gladlier grew.<br> Yet went she not as not with such discourse<br> Delighted, or not capable her ear<br> Of what was high. Such pleasure she reserved,<br> Adam relating, she sole auditress;<br> Her husband the relater she preferred<br> Before the Angel, and of him to ask<br> Chose rather; he, she knew, would intermix<br> Grateful digressions, and solve high dispute<br> With conjugal caresses: from his lip<br> Not words alone pleased her. Oh, when meet now<br> Such pairs, in love and mutual honour joined?<br> With goddess-like demeanour forth she went,<br> Not unattended; for on her as Queen<br> A pomp of winning Graces waited still,<br> And from about her shot darts of desire<br> Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.<br> And Raphael now to Adam's doubt proposed<br> Benevolent and facile thus replied:—</p>  
 <p>"To ask or search I blame thee not; for Heaven<br> Is as the Book of God before thee set,<br> Wherein to read his wondrous works, and learn<br> His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years.<br> This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth<br> Imports not, if thou reckon right; the rest<br> From Man or Angel the great Architect<br> Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge<br> His secrets, to be scanned by them who ought<br> Rather admire. Or, if they list to try<br> Conjecture, he his fabric of the Heavens<br> Hath left to their disputes-perhaps to move<br> His laughter at their quaint opinions wide<br> Hereafter, when they come to model Heaven,<br> And calculate the stars; how they will wield<br> The mighty frame; how build, unbuild, contrive<br> To save appearances; how gird the Sphere<br> With Centric and Eccentric scribbled o'er,<br> Cycle and Epicycle, orb in orb.<br> Already by thy reasoning this I guess,<br> Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest<br> That bodies bright and greater should not serve<br> The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,<br> Earth sitting still, when she alone receives<br> The benefit. Consider, first, that great<br> Or bright infers not excellence. The Earth,<br> Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,<br> Nor glistering, may of solid good contain<br> More plenty than the Sun that barren shines,<br> Whose virtue on itself works no effect,<br> But in the fruitful Earth; there first receivod,<br> His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.<br> Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries<br> Officious, but to thee, Earth's habitant.<br> And, for the Heaven's wide circuit, let it speak<br> The Maker's high magnificence, who built<br> So spacious, and his line stretched out so far,<br> That Man may know he dwells not in his own—<br> An edifice too large for him to fill,<br> Lodged in a small partition, and the rest<br> Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.<br> The swiftness of those Circles at'tribute,<br> Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,<br> That to corporeal substances could add<br> Speed almost spiritual. Me thou think'st not slow,<br> Who since the morning-hour set out from Heaven<br> Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived<br> In Eden-distance inexpressible<br> By numbers that have name. But this I urge,<br> Admitting motion in the Heavens, to shew<br> Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;<br> Not that I so affirm, though so it seem<br> To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth.<br> God, to remove his ways from human sense,<br> Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,<br> If it presume, might err in things too high,<br> And no advantage gain. What if the Sun<br> Be centre to the World, and other Stars,<br> By his attractive virtue and their own<br> Incited, dance about him various rounds?<br> Their wandering course, now high, now low, then hid,<br> Progressive, retrograde, or standing still,<br> In six thou seest; and what if, seventh to these<br> The planet Earth, so steadfast though she seem,<br> Insensibly three different motions move?<br> Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe,<br> Moved contrary with thwart obliquities,<br> Or save the Sun his labour, and that swift<br> Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed,<br> Invisible else above all stars, the wheel<br> Of Day and Night; which needs not they belief,<br> If Earth, industrious of herself, fetch Day,<br> Travelling east, and with her part averse<br> From the Sun's beam meet Night, her other part<br> Still luminous by his ray. What if that light,<br> Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air,<br> To the terrestrial Moon to be as a star,<br> Enlightening her by day, as she by night<br> This Earth-reciprocal, if land be there,<br> Fields and inhabitants? Her spots thou seest<br> As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce<br> Fruits in her softened soil, for some to eat<br> Allotted there; and other Suns, perhaps,<br> With their attendant Moons, thou wilt descry,<br> Communicating male and female light—<br> Which to great sexes animate the World,<br> Stored in each Orb perhaps with some that live.<br> For such vast room in Nature unpossessed<br> By living soul, desert and desolate,<br> Only to shine, yet scarce to con'tribute<br> Each Orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far<br> Down to this habitable, which returns<br> Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.<br> But whether thus these things, or whether not—<br> Whether the Sun, predominant in heaven,<br> Rise on the Earth, or Earth rise on the Sun;<br> He from the east his flaming road begin,<br> Or she from west her silent course advance<br> With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps<br> On her soft axle, while she paces even,<br> And bears thee soft with the smooth air along—<br> Solicit not thy thoughts with matters hid:<br> Leave them to God above; him serve and fear.<br> Of other creatures as him pleases best,<br> Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou<br> In what he gives to thee, this Paradise<br> And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high<br> To know what passes there. Be lowly wise;<br> Think only what concerns thee and thy being;<br> Dream not to other worlds, what creatures there<br> Live, in what state, condition, or degreed-<br> Contented that thus far hath been revealed<br> Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven."</p>  
 <p>To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied:—<br> "How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure<br> Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene,<br> And, freed from intricacies, taught to live<br> The easiest way, nor with perplexing thoughts<br> To interrupt the sweet of life, from which<br> God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares,<br> And not molest us, unless we ourselves<br> Seek them with wandering thoughts, and notions vain!<br> But apt the mind or fancy is to rove<br> Unchecked; and of her roving is no end,<br> Till, warned, or by experience taught, she learn<br> That not to know at large of things remote<br> From use, obscure and subtle, but to know<br> That which before us lies in daily life,<br> Is the prime wisdom: what is more is fume,<br> Or emptiness, or fond impertinence,<br> And renders us in things that most concern<br> Unpractised, unprepared, and still to seek.<br> Therefore from this high pitch let us descend<br> A lower flight, and speak of things at hand<br> Useful; whence, haply, mentiin may arise<br> Of something not unreasonable to ask,<br> By sufferance, and thy wonted favour, deigned.<br> Thee I have heard relating what was done<br> Ere my remembrance; now hear me relate<br> My story, which perhaps, thou hast not heard.<br> And day is yet not spent; till then thou seest<br> How subtly to detain thee I devise,<br> Inviting thee to hear while I relate—<br> Fond, were it not in hope of thy reply.<br> For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven;<br> And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear<br> Than fruits of palm-tree, pleasantest to thirst<br> And hunger both, from labour, at the hour<br> Of sweet repast. They satiate, and soon fill,<br> Though pleasant; but thy words, with grace divine<br> Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety."</p>  
 <p>To whom thus Raphael answered, heavenly meek:—<br> "Nor are thy lips ungrateful, Sire of Men,<br> Nor tongue ineloquent; for God on thee<br> Abundantly his gifts hath also poured,<br> Inward and outward both, his image fair:<br> Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace<br> Attends thee, and each word, each motion, forms.<br> Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth<br> Than of our fellow-servant, and inquire<br> Gladly into the ways of God with Man;<br> For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set<br> On Man his equal love. Say therefore on;<br> For I that day was absent, as befell,<br> Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure,<br> Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell,<br> Squared in full legion (such command we had),<br> To see that none thence issued forth a spy<br> Or enemy, while God was in his work,<br> Lest he, incensed at such eruption bold,<br> Destruction with Creation might have mixed.<br> Not that they durst without his leave attempt;<br> But us he sends upon his high behests<br> For state, as sovran King, and to inure<br> Our prompt obedience. Fast we found, fast shut,<br> The dismal gates, and barricaded strong,<br> But, long ere our approaching, heard within<br> Noise, other than the sound of dance or song—<br> Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.<br> Glad we returned up to the coasts of Light<br> Ere Sabbath-evening; so we had in charge.<br> But thy relation now: for I attend,<br> Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine."</p>  
 <p>So spake the godlike Power, and thus our Sire:—<br> "For Man to tell how human life began<br> Is hard; for who himself beginning knew?<br> Desire with thee still longer to converse<br> Induced me. As new-waked from soundest sleep,<br> Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid,<br> In balmy sweat, which with his beams the Sun<br> Soon dried, and on the reeking moisture fed.<br> Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned,<br> And gazed a while the ample sky, till, raised<br> By quick instinctive motion, up I sprung,<br> As thitherward endeavoring, and upright<br> Stood on my feet. About me round I saw<br> Hill, dale, and shady woods, and sunny plains,<br> And liquid lapse of murmuring streams; by these,<br> Creatures that lived and moved, and walked or flew,<br> Birds on the branches warbling: all things smiled;<br> With fragrance and with joy my heart o'erflowed.<br> Myself I then perused, and limb by limb<br> Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran<br> With supple joints, as lively vigour led;<br> But who I was, or where, or from what cause,<br> Knew not. To speak I tried, and forthwith spake;<br> My tongue obeyed, and readily could name<br> Whate'er I saw. 'Thou Sun,' said I, 'fair light,<br> And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,<br> Ye hills and dales, ye rivers, woods, and plains,<br> And ye that live and move, fair creatures, tell,<br> Tell, if ye saw, how came I thus, how here!<br> Not of myself; by some great Maker then,<br> tin goodness and in power prae-eminent.<br> Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,<br> From whom I have that thus I move and live,<br> And feel that I am happier than I know!'<br> While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,<br> From where I first drew air, and first beheld<br> This happy light, when answer none returned,<br> On a green shady bank, profuse of flowers,<br> Pensive I sat me down. There gentle sleep<br> First found me, and with soft oppression seized<br> My drowsed sense, untroubled, though I thought<br> I then was passing to my former state<br> Insensible, and forthwith to dissolve:<br> When suddenly stood at my head a Dream,<br> Whose inward apparition gently moved<br> My fancy to believe I yet had being,<br> And lived. One came, methought, of shape divine,<br> And said, 'Thy mansion wants thee, Adam; rise,<br> First Man, of men innumerable ordained<br> First father! called by thee, I come thy guide<br> To the Garden of bliss, thy seat prepared.'<br> So saying, by the hand he took me, raised,<br> And over fields and waters, as in air<br> Smooth sliding without step, last led me up<br> A woody mountain, whose high top was plain,<br> A circuit wide, enclosed, with goodliest trees<br> Planted, with walks and bowers, that what I saw<br> Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed. Each tree<br> Loaden with fairest fruit, that hung to the eye<br> Tempting, stirred in me sudden appetite<br> To pluck and eat; whereat I waked, and found<br> Before mine eyes all real, as the dream<br> Had lively shadowed. Here had new begun<br> My wandering, had not He who was my guide<br> Up hither from among the trees appeared,<br> Presence Divine. Rejoicing, but with awe,<br> In adoration at his feet I fell<br> Submiss. He reared me, and, 'Whom thou sought'st I am,'<br> Said mildly, 'Author of all this thou seest<br> Above, or round about thee, or beneath.<br> This Paradise I give thee; count it thine<br> To till and keep, and of the fruit to eat.<br> Of every tree that in the Garden grows<br> Eat freely with glad heart; fear here no dearth.<br> But of the tree whose operation brings<br> Knowledge of Good and Ill, which I have set,<br> The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith,<br> Amid the garden by the Tree of Life—<br> Remember what I warn thee-shun to taste,<br> And shun the bitter consequence: for know,<br> The day thou eat'st thereof, my sole command<br> Transgressed, inevitably thou shalt die,<br> From that day mortal, and this happy state<br> Shalt lose, expelled from hence into a world<br> Of woe and sorrow.' Sternly he pronounced<br> The rigid interdiction, which resounds<br> Yet dreadful in mine ear, though in my choice<br> Not to incur; but soon his clear aspect'<br> Returned, and gracious purpose thus renewed:—<br> 'Not only these fair bounds, but all the Earth<br> To thee and to thy race I give; as lords<br> Possess it, and all things that therein live,<br> Or live in sea or air, beast, fish, and fowl.<br> In sign whereof, each bird and beast behold<br> After their kinds; I bring them to receive<br> From thee their names, and pay thee fealty<br> With low subjection. Understand the same<br> Of fish within their watery residence,<br> Not hither summoned, since they cannot change<br> Their element to draw the thinner air.'<br> As thus he spake, each bird and beast behold<br> Approaching two and two-these cowering low<br> With blandishment; each bird stooped on his wing.<br> I named them as they passed, and understood<br> Their nature; with such knowledge God endued<br> My sudden apprehension. But in these<br> I found not what methought I wanted still,<br> And to the Heavenly Vision thus presumed:—</p>  
 <p>"'O, by what name-or Thou above all these,<br> Above mankind, or aught than mankind higher,<br> Surpassestwfar my naming-how may I<br> Adore thee, Author of this Universe,<br> And all this good to Man, for whose well-being<br> So amply, and with hands so liberal,<br> Thou hast provided all things? But with me<br> I see not who partakes. In solitude<br> What happiness? who can enjoy alone,<br> Or, all enjoying, what contentment find?'<br> Thus I, presumptuous; and the Vision bright,<br> As with a smile more brightened, thus replied:—</p>  
 <p>"'What call'st thou solitude? Is not the Earth<br> With various living creatures, and the Air,<br> Replenished, and all these at thy command<br> To come and play before thee? Know'st thou not<br> Their language and their ways? They also know,<br> And reason not contemptibly; with these<br> Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.'<br> So spake the Universal Lord and seemed<br> So ordering. I, with leave of speech implored,<br> And humble deprecation, thus replied:—</p>  
 <p>"'Let not my words offend thee, Heavenly Power;<br> My Maker, be propitious while I speak.<br> Hast thou not made me here thy substitute,<br> And these inferior far beneath me set?<br> Among unequals what society<br> Can sort, what harmony or true delight?<br> Which must be mutual, in proportion due<br> Given and received; but, in disparity,<br> The one intense, the other still remiss,<br> Clnnot well suit with either, but soon prove<br> Tedious alike. Of fellowship I speak<br> Such as I seek, fit to participate<br> All rational delight, wherein the brute<br> Cannot be human consort. They rejoice<br> Each with their kind, lion with lioness;<br> So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined:<br> Much less can bird with beast, or fish with fowl,<br> So well converse, nor with the ox the ape;<br> Worse, then, can man with beast, and least of all.'</p>  
 <p>"Whereto the Almighty answered, not displeased:—<br> 'A nice and subtle happiness, I see,<br> Thou to thyself proposest, in the choice<br> Of thy associates, Adam, and wilt taste<br> No pleasure, though in pleasure, solitary.<br> What think'st thou, then, of Me, and this my state?<br> Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed<br> Of happiness, or not, who am alone<br> From all eternity? for none I know<br> Second to me or like, equal much less.<br> How have I, then, with whom to hold converse,<br> Save with the creatures which I made, and those<br> To me inferior infinite descents<br> Beneath what other creatures are to thee?'</p>  
 <p>"He ceased. I lowly answered:—'To attain<br> The highth and depth of thy eternal ways<br> All human thoughts come short, Supreme of Things!<br> Thou in thyself art perfect, and in Thee<br> Is no deficience found. Not so is Man,<br> But in degree-the cause of his desire<br> By conversation with his like to help<br> Or solace his defects. No need that thou<br> Should'st propagate, already infinite,<br> And through all numbers absolute, though One;<br> But Man by number is to manifest<br> His single imperfection, and beget<br> Like of his like, his image multiplied,<br> In unity defective; which requires<br> Collateral love, and dearest amity.<br> Thou, in thy secrecy although alone,<br> Best with thyself accompanied, seek'st not<br> Social communication-yet, so pleased,<br> Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt<br> Of union or communion, deified;<br> I, by conversing, cannot these erect<br> From prone, nor in their ways complacence find.<br> Thus I emboldened spake, and freedom used<br> Permissive, and acceptance found; which gained<br> This answer from the gratious Voice Divine:—</p>  
 <p>"'Thus far to try thee, Adam, I was pleased,<br> And find thee knowing not of beasts alone,<br> Which thou hast rightly named, but of thyself—<br> Expressing well the spirit within thee free,<br> My image, not imparted to the brute;<br> Whose fellowship, therefore, unmeet for thee,<br> Good Reason was thou freely shouldst dislike.<br> And be so minded still. I, ere thou spak'st,<br> Knew it not good for Man to be alone,<br> And no such company as then thou saw'st<br> Intended thee-for trial only brought,<br> To see how thou couldst judge of fit and meet.<br> What next I bring shall please thee, be assured,<br> Thy likeness, thy fit help, thy other self,<br> Thy wish exactly to thy heart's desire.'</p>  
 <p>"He ended, or I heard no more; for now<br> My earthly, by his heavenly overpowered,<br> Which it had long stood under, strained to the highth<br> In that celestial colloquy sublime,<br> As with an object that excels the sense,<br> Dazzled and spent, sunk down, and sought repair<br> Of sleep, which instantly fell on me, called<br> By Nature as in aid, and closed mine eyes.<br> Mine eyes he closed, but open left the cell<br> Of fancy, my internal sight; by which,<br> Abstract as in a trance, methought I saw,<br> Though sleeping, where I lay, and saw the Shape<br> Still glorious before whom awake I stood;<br> Who, stooping, opened my left side, and took<br> From thence a rib, with cordial spirits warm,<br> And life-blood streaming fresh; wide was the wound,<br> But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed.<br> The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands;<br> Under his forming hands a creature grew,<br> Man-like, but different sex, so lovely fair<br> That what seemed fair in all the world seemed now<br> Mean, or in her summed up, in her contained<br> And in her looks, which from that time infused<br> Sweetness into my heart unfelt before,<br> And into all things from her air inspired<br> The spirit of love and amorous delight.<br> She disappeared, and left me dark; I waked<br> To find her, or for ever to deplore<br> Her loss, and other pleasures all adjure:<br> When, out of hope, behold her not far off,<br> Such as I saw her in my dream, adorned<br> With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow<br> To make her amiable. On she came,<br> Led by her Heavenly Maker, though unseen<br> And guided by his voice, nor uninformed<br> Of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites.<br> Grace was in all her steps, heaven in her eye,<br> In every gesture dignity and love.<br> I, overjoyed, could not forbear aloud:—</p>  
 <p>"'This turn hath made amends; thou hast fulfilled<br> Thy words, Creator bounteous and benign,<br> Giver of all things fair-but fairest this<br> Of all thy gifts!-nor enviest. I now see<br> Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh, my Self<br> Before me. Woman is her name, of Man<br> Extracted; for this cause he shall forgo<br> Father and mother, and to his wife adhere,<br> And they shall be one flesh, one heart, one soul.'</p>  
 <p>"She heard me thus; and, though divinely brought,<br> Yet innocence and virgin modesty,<br> Her virtue, and the conscience of her worth,<br> That would be wooed, and not unsought be won,<br> Not obvious, not obtrusive, but retired,<br> The most desirable-or, to say all,<br> Nature herself, though pure of sinful thought—<br> Wrought in her so, that, seeing me, she turned.<br> I followed her; she what was honour knew,<br> And with obsequious majesty approved<br> My pleaded reason. To the nuptial bower<br> I led her blushing like the Morn; all Heaven,<br> And happy constellations, on that hour<br> Shed their selectest influence; the Earth<br> Gave sign of gratulation, and each hill;<br> Joyous the birds; fresh gales and gentle airs<br> Whispered it to the woods, and from their wings<br> Flung rose, flung odours from the spicy shrub,<br> Disporting, till the amorous bird of night<br> Sung spousal, and bid haste the Evening-star<br> On his hill-top to light the bridal lamp.</p>  
 <p>"Thus have I told thee all my state, and brought<br> My story to the sum of earthly bliss<br> Which I enjoy, and must confess to find<br> In all things else delight indeed, but such<br> As, use or not, works in the mind no change,<br> Nor vehement desire-these delicacies<br> I mean of taste, sight, smell, herbs, fruits, and flowers,<br> Walks, and the melody of birds: but here,<br> Far otherwise, transported I behold,<br> Transported touch; here passion first I felt,<br> Commotion strange, in all enjoyments else<br> Superior and unmoved, here only weak<br> Against the charm of beauty's powerful glance.<br> Or Nature failed in me, and left some part<br> Not proof enough such object to sustain,<br> Or, from my side subducting, took perhaps<br> More than enough-at least on her bestowed<br> Too much of ornament, in outward show<br> Elaborate, of inward less exact.<br> For well I understand in the prime end<br> Of Nature her the inferior, in the mind<br> And inward faculties, which most excel;<br> In outward also her resembling less<br> His image who made both, and less expressing<br> The character of that dominion given<br> O'er other creatures. Yet when I approach<br> Her loveliness, so absolute she seems<br> And in herself complete, so well to know<br> Her own, that what she wills to do or say<br> Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best.<br> All higher Knowledge in her presence falls<br> Degraded; Wisdom in discourse with her<br> Loses, discountenanced, and like Folly shews;<br> Authority and Reason on her wait,<br> As one intended first, not after made<br> Occasionally; and, to consum'mate all,<br> Greatness of mind and nobleness their seat<br> Build in her loveliest, and create an awe<br> About her, as a guard angelic placed."</p>  
 <p>To whom the Angel, with contracted brow:—<br> "Accuse not Nature! she hath done her part;<br> Do thou but thine! and be not diffident<br> Of Wisdom; she deserts thee not, if thou<br> Dismiss not her, when most thou need'st her nigh,<br> By attribu'ting overmuch to things<br> Less excellent, as thou thyself perceiv'st.<br> For, what admir'st thou, what transports thee so?<br> An outside-fair, no doubt, and worthy well<br> Thy cherishing, thy honouring, and thy love;<br> Not thy subjection. Weigh with her thyself;<br> Then value. Oft-times nothing profits more<br> Than self-esteem, grounded on just and right<br> Well managed. Of that skill the more thou know'st,<br> The more she will acknowledge thee her head,<br> And to realities yield all her shows—<br> Made so adorn for thy delight the more,<br> So awful, that with honour thou may'st love<br> Thy mate, who sees when thou art seen least wise<br> But, if the sense of touch, whereby mankind<br> Is propagated, seem such dear delight<br> Beyond all other, think the same voutsafed<br> To cattle and each beast; which would not be<br> To them made common and divulged, if aught<br> Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue<br> The soul of Man, or passion in him move.<br> What higher in her society thou find'st<br> Attractive, human, rational, love still;<br> In loving thou dost well; in passion not,<br> Wherein true Love consists not. Love refines<br> The thoughts, and heart enlarges-hath his seat<br> In Reason, and is judicious, is the scale<br> By which to Heavenly Love thou may'st ascend,<br> Not sunk in carnal pleasure; for which cause<br> Among the beasts no mate for thee was found."</p>  
 <p>To whom thus, half abashed, Adam replied:—<br> "Neither her outside formed so fair, nor aught<br> In procreation, common to all kinds<br> (Though higher of the genial bed by far,<br> And with mysterious reverence, I deem),<br> So much delights me as those graceful acts,<br> Those thousand decencies, that daily flow<br> From all her words and actions, mixed with love<br> And sweet compliance, which declare unfeigned<br> Union of mind, or in us both one soul—<br> Harmony to behold in wedded pair<br> More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear.<br> Yet these subject not; I to thee disclose<br> What inward thence I feel, not therefore foiled,<br> Who meet with various objects, from the sense<br> Variously representing, yet, still free,<br> Approve the best, and follow what I approve.<br> To love thou blam'st me not-for Love, thou say'st,<br> Leads up to Heaven, is both the way and guide;<br> Bear with me, then, if lawful what I ask.<br> Love not the Heavenly Spirits, and how their love<br> Express they-by looks only, or do they mix<br> Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?"</p>  
 <p>To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed<br> Celestial rosy-red, Love's proper hue,<br> Answered:—"Let it suffice thee that thou know'st<br> Us happy, and without Love no happiness.<br> Whatever pure thou in the body enjoy'st<br> (And pure thou wert created) we enjoy<br> In eminence, and obstacle find none<br> Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars.<br> Easier than air with air, if Spirits embrace,<br> Total they mix, union of pure with pure<br> Desiring, nor restrained conveyance need<br> As flesh to mix with flesh, or soul with soul.<br> But I can now no more: the parting Sun<br> Beyond the Earth's green Cape and verdant Isles<br> Hesperean sets, my signal to depart.<br> Be strong, live happy, and love! but first of all<br> Him whom to love is to obey, and keep<br> His great command; take heed lest passion sway<br> Thy judgment to do aught which else free-will<br> Would not admit; thine and of all thy sons<br> The weal or woe in thee is placed; beware!<br> I in thy persevering shall rejoice,<br> And all the Blest. Stand fast; to stand or fall<br> Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.<br> Perfet within, no outward aid require;<br> And all temptation to transgress repel."</p>  
 <p>So saying, he arose; whom Adam thus<br> Followed with benediction:—"Since to part,<br> Go, Heavenly Guest, Ethereal Messenger,<br> Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore!<br> Gentle to me and affable hath been<br> Thy condescension, and shall be honoured ever<br> With grateful memory. Thou to Mankind<br> Be good and friendly still, and oft return!"</p>  
 <p>So parted they, the Angel up to Heaven<br> From the thick shade, and Adam to his bower.</p>
