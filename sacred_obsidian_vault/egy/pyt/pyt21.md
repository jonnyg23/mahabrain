 <p>765a. To say: O Osiris N., take to thyself this thy libation, which is
 offered to thee by Horus,</p>
 
 <p>765b. in thy name of "He who is come from the cataract"; take to
 thyself thy natron that thou mayest be divine.</p>
 
 <p>765c. Thy mother Nut has made thee to be as a god to thine enemy (or, in
 spite of thee), in thy name of "God."</p>
 
 <p>766a. Take to thyself the efflux which goes forth from thee.</p>
 
 <p>766b. Horus has made me assemble for thee the gods from every place to which
 thou hast gone.</p>

 <p>766d. Horus has made me count for thee his children even to the place where
 thou wast drowned.</p>

 <p>767a. <i>Ḥr-rnp.wi</i> recognizes thee,
 for thou art made young again, ill this thy name of "Fresh water."</p>
 
 <p>767b. Horus is indeed a soul, for he recognizes his father in thee, in his
 name of "<i>Ḥr-bȝ-iti-rp.t</i>."</p>
 
 <p align="center"><i>Utterance
 424</i>.</p>
 
 <p>768a. To say: O N., this thy going, these thy goings;</p>
 
 <p>768b. is that going of Horus, by this his going, by these his goings,</p>
 
 <p>769a. as his runners hastened, so his envoys rushed on behind,</p>
 
 <p>769b. so that they might announce him to him who lifts up the arm in the
 East.</p>
 
 <p>769c. Rejoice, N.,</p>
 
 <p>769d. thine arms are like those of <i>Wpi.w</i>,
 thy face like that of <i>Wp-wȝ-wt</i>.</p>
 
 <p>770a. O N., may the king make an offering,</p>
 
 <p>770b. that thou mayest occupy thy Horite regions, that thou mayest pass
 through thy Setite regions.</p>
 
 <p>770c. Thou sittest on thy firm throne,</p>
 
 <p>770d. thou directest their words to him who is at the head of the Great
 Ennead, who are in Heliopolis.</p>
 
 <p>771a. O N., <i>Mḫnti-n-irti</i>
 protects thee,</p>
 
 <p>771b. thy herdsman, who is behind thy calves.</p>
 
 <p>771c. O N., <i>r</i>--- protects thee
 against the spirits.</p>
 
 <p>772a. O N., know</p>
 
 <p>772b. that thou shalt take for thyself this thy divine offering, that thou
 mayest be satisfied with it every day:</p>
 
 <p>773a. thousands of loaves of bread, thousands of mugs of beer, thousands of
 heads of oxen, thousands of geese,</p>
 
 <p>773b. thousands of all sweet things, thousands of all textures.</p>
 
 <p>7 74a. O N., thy water belongs to thee, thy abundance belongs to thee,</p>
 
 <p>774b. thy natron belongs to thee, (all) which is brought to thee by thy
 brother, <i>Nḫḫ</i>.</p>
 
 <p align="center"><i>Utterance
 425</i>.</p>
 
 <p>775a. To say: Osiris N., thou art avenged; I have given all gods to thee,</p>
 
 <p>775b. together with their inheritance, together with their food,</p>
 
 <p>775c. together with all their things. Thou shalt not die.</p>
