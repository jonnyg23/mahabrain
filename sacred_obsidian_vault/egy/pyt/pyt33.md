 <p align="center"><i>Utterance
 553</i>.</p>
 
 <p>1353a. To say: Geb has raised thee up; this thy spirit has been guarded for
 thee.</p>
 
 <p>1353b. Thy <i>mns</i>-jar remains; thy <i>mns</i>-jar is caused to remain.</p>
 
 <p>1353c. Thou art more exalted than Shu and Tefnut in the house of <i>Ḥtmw.t</i> (the destroyer), N.,</p>
 
 <p>1354a. for thou art verily a spirit who wast nursed by Nephthys with her
 left breast.</p>
 
 <p>1354b. Osiris has given to thee the spirits; take the eye of Horus to thee.</p>
 
 <p>1355a. These thy four ways which are before the grave of Horus</p>
 
 <p>1355b. are those whereon one goes (lit. goes a going) to the god</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 220</font></a></p>
 
 <p>as soon as the sun sets (or, as far as the setting of the sun).</p>
 
 <p>1356a. He takes hold of thine arm, after Seker, chief of <i>P<u>d</u>w-š</i> purified thee,</p>
 
 <p>1356b. (and he conducted thee) to thy throne which is in <i>ḳbḥ.w</i>.</p>
 
 <p>1357a. Raise thyself up, spirit of N.; sit, eat thou;</p>
 
 <p>1357b. let thy <i>ka</i> be seated, that
 he may eat bread and beer with thee without ceasing for ever and ever.</p>
 
 <p>1358a. Thy going is as a representative of Osiris;</p>
 
 <p>1358b. thy feet hit thine arms;</p>
 
 <p>1358c. they bring thee to thy feasts,</p>
 
 <p>1358d. to thy white teeth, (to) thy fingernails, (to) the <i><u>D</u>w.f</i>-nome.</p>
 
 <p>1359a. Thou ferriest over as the great bull to the green fields,</p>
 
 <p>1359b. to the pure places of Rē.</p>
 
 <p>1360a. Raise thyself up, spirit of N.; thy water belongs to thee, thine
 abundance belongs to thee;</p>
 
 <p>1360b. thine efflux belongs to thee, which issued from the secretion of
 Osiris.</p>
 
 <p>1361a. The double doors of heaven are open for thee; the double doors of <i>ḳbḥ.w</i> are undone for thee;</p>
 
 <p>1361b. the double doors of the tomb are open for thee; the double doors of
 Nut are unfastened for thee.</p>
 
 <p>1362a. "Greeting," says Isis; "ferry on in peace," says
 Nephthys,</p>
 
 <p>1362b. after she had seen thy father, Osiris, on the day of the <i>mm.t</i>-feast (or, of feasting him who is
 in need ?).</p>
 
 <p>1362c. Elevated is the <i><u>d</u>db.t</i>-chapel
 of the double <i>itr.t</i>-palace of the
 North, thy <i>Grg.w-bȝ</i>.</p>
 
 <p>1363a. Raise thyself up; shake off thy dust;</p>
 
 <p>1363b. remove the dirt which is on thy face; loose thy bandages.</p>
 
 <p>1363c. They are indeed not bandages; they are the locks of Nephthys.</p>
 
 <p>13 64a. Travel over the southern regions; travel over the northern regions;</p>
 
 <p>1364b. be seated on thy firm throne.</p>
 
 <p>1364c. Anubis, who is chief of the <i>sḥ-n<u>t</u>r</i>,
 commands that thy spirit be behind thee, that thy might be in thy body,</p>
 
 <p>1364d. that thou remain Chief of the mighty ones (or, spirits).</p>
 
 <p>1365a. Thou purifiest thyself with these thy four <i>nmś.t</i>-jars,</p>
 
 <p>1365b. (with) the <i>špn.t</i> and <i>ȝt</i>-jar, which come from the <i>sḥ-n<u>t</u>r</i> for thee, that thou mayest
 become divine.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 221</font></a></p>
 
 <p>1365c. The sky weeps for thee; the earth trembles for thee;</p>
 
 <p>1366a. the <i>śmnt.t</i>-woman laments
 for thee; the great <i>min.t</i> mourns for
 thee;</p>
 
 <p>1366b. the feet agitate for thee; the hands wave for thee,</p>
 
 <p>1366c. when thou ascendest to heaven as a star, as the morning star.</p>
 
 <p>1367a. N. is come to thee, his father; he is come to thee, Geb;</p>
 
 <p>1367b. he is united with your dead, O gods.</p>
 
 <p>1367c. Let him sit on the great throne, on the lap of his father <i>Mḫnti-'irti</i>;</p>
 
 <p>1368a. let him purify his mouth with incense and natron; let him purify his
 nails upper and lower.</p>
 
 <p>1368b. Let one do for him what was done for his father, Osiris, on the day
 of assembling the bones,</p>
 
 <p>1368c. of making firm (or, adjusting) the sandals, of crossing the feet
 (i.e. when ferrying over).</p>
 
 <p>1369a. To thee come the wise and the understanding;</p>
 
 <p>1369b. to thee comes the southern <i>itr.t</i>-palace,</p>
 
 <p>1369c. to thee comes the northern <i>itr.t</i>-palace,
 with a salutation,</p>
 
 <p>1369d. (thou) who endurest eternally at the head of the mighty ones.</p>
