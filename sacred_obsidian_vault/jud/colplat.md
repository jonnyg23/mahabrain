 In view of the changes that have taken place in the modern world and 
 the consequent need of stating anew the teachings of Reform Judaism, 
 the Central Conference of American Rabbis makes the following 
 declaration of principles. It presents them not as a fixed creed but 
 as a guide for the progressive elements of Jewry.
 
 
 </p><h3>A. Judaism and it's Foundations</h3>
 <ol>
 <li><em>Nature of Judaism.</em> Judaism is the historical religious 
 experience of the Jewish people. Though growing out of Jewish life, 
 its message is universal, aiming at the union and perfection of 
 mankind under the sovereignty of God. Reform Judaism recognizes the 
 principle of progressive development in religion and consciously 
 applies this principle to spiritual as well as to cultural and social 
 life. Judaism welcomes all truth, whether written in the pages of 
 scripture or deciphered from the records of nature. The new 
 discoveries of science, while replacing the older scientific views 
 underlying our sacred literature, do not conflict with the essential 
 spirit of religion as manifested in the consecration of manUs will, 
 heart and mind to the service of God and of humanity.
 
 <p>
 
 </p></li><li><em>God.</em> The heart of Judaism and its chief contribution to 
 religion is the doctrine of the One, living God, who rules the world 
 through law and love. In Him all existence has its creative source and
 mankind its ideal of conduct. Though transcending time and space, He 
 is the indwelling Presence of the world. We worship Him as the Lord of
 the universe and as our merciful Father.
 
 <p>
 </p></li><li><em>Man.</em> Judaism affirms that man is created in the Divine 
 image. His spirit is immortal. He is an active co-worker with God. As 
 a child of God, he is endowed with moral freedom and is charged with 
 the responsibility of overcoming evil and striving after ideal ends.
 
 <p>
 </p></li><li><em>Torah.</em> God reveals Himself not only in the majesty, 
 beauty and orderliness of nature, but also in the vision and moral 
 striving of the human spirit. Revelation is a continuous process, 
 confined to no one group and to no one age. Yet the people of Israel, 
 through its prophets and sages, achieved unique insight in the realm 
 of religious truth. The Torah, both written and oral, enshrines 
 Israel's ever-growing consciousness of God and of the moral law. It 
 preserves the historical precedents, sanctions and norms of Jewish 
 life, and seeks to mould it in the patterns of goodness and of 
 holiness. Being products of historical processes, certain of its laws 
 have lost their binding force with the passing of the conditions that 
 called them forth. But as a depository of permanent spiritual ideals, 
 the Torah remains the dynamic source of the life of Israel. Each age 
 has the obligation to adapt the teachings of the Torah to its basic 
 needs in consonance with the genius of Judaism.
 
 <p>
 </p></li><li><em>Israel.</em> Judaism is the soul of which Israel is the body. 
 Living in all parts of the world, Israel has been held together by the
 ties of a common history, and above all, by the heritage of faith. 
 Though we recognize in the group loyalty of Jews who have become 
 estranged from our religious tradition, a bond which still unites them
 with us, we maintain that it is by its religion and for its religion 
 that the Jewish people has lived. The non-Jew who accepts our faith is
 welcomed as a full member of the Jewish community. In all lands where 
 our people live, they assume and seek to share loyally the full duties
 and responsibilities of citizenship and to create seats of Jewish 
 knowledge and religion. In the rehabilitation of Palestine, the land 
 hallowed by memories and hopes, we behold the promise of renewed life 
 for many of our brethren. We affirm the obligation of all Jewry to aid
 in its upbuilding as a Jewish homeland by endeavoring to make it not 
 only a haven of refuge for the oppressed but also a center of Jewish 
 culture and spiritual life. Throughout the ages it has been IsraelUs 
 mission to witness to the Divine in the face of every form of paganism
 and materialism. We regard it as our historic task to cooperate with 
 all men in the establishment of the kingdom of God, of universal 
 brotherhood, Justice, truth and peace on earth. This is our Messianic 
 goal.
 <p>
 </p><h3>B. Ethics</h3>
 
 </li><li><em>Ethics and Religion.</em> In Judaism religion and morality 
 blend into an indissoluble unity. Seeking God means to strive after 
 holiness, righteousness and goodness. The love of God is incomplete 
 without the love of one's fellowmen. Judaism emphasizes the kinship of
 the human race, the sanctity and worth of human life and personality 
 and the right of the individual to freedom and to the pursuit of his 
 chosen vocation. justice to all, irrespective of race, sect or class, 
 is the inalienable right and the inescapable obligation of all. The 
 state and organized government exist in order to further these ends.
 
 <p>
 </p></li><li><em>Social justice.</em> Judaism seeks the attainment of a just 
 society by the application of its teachings to the economic order, to 
 industry and commerce, and to national and international affairs. It 
 aims at the elimination of man-made misery and suffering, of poverty 
 and degradation, of tyranny and slavery, of social inequality and 
 prejudice, of ill-will and strife. It advocates the promotion of 
 harmonious relations between warring classes on the basis of equity 
 and justice, and the creation of conditions under which human 
 personality may flourish. It pleads for the safeguarding of childhood 
 against exploitation. It champions the cause of all who work and of 
 their right to an adequate standard of living, as prior to the rights 
 of property. Judaism emphasizes the duty of charity, and strives for a
 social order which will protect men against the material disabilities 
 of old age, sickness and unemployment.
 
 <p>
 </p></li><li><em>Peace.</em> Judaism, from the days of the prophets, has 
 proclaimed to mankind the ideal of universal peace. The spiritual and 
 physical disarmament of all nations has been one of its essential 
 teachings. It abhors all violence and relies upon moral education, 
 love and sympathy to secure human progress. It regards justice as the 
 foundation of the well-being of nations and the condition of enduring 
 peace. It urges organized international action for disarmament, 
 collective security and world peace.
 <p>
 </p><h3>C. Religious Practice</h3>
 
 </li><li><em>The Religious Life.</em> Jewish life is marked by consecration
 to these ideals of Judaism. It calls for faithful participation in the
 life of the Jewish community as it finds expression in home, synagogue
 and school and in all other agencies that enrich Jewish life and 
 promote its welfare. The Home has been and must continue to be a 
 stronghold of Jewish life, hallowed by the spirit of love and 
 reverence, by moral discipline and religious observance and worship. 
 The Synagogue is the oldest and most democratic institution in Jewish 
 life. It is the prime communal agency by which Judaism is fostered and
 preserved. It links the Jews of each community and unites them with 
 all Israel. The perpetuation of Judaism as a living force depends upon
 religious knowledge and upon the Education of each new generation in 
 our rich cultural and spiritual heritage.
 
 <p>Prayer is the voice of religion, the language of faith and 
 aspiration. It directs man's heart and mind Godward, voices the needs 
 and hopes of the community and reaches out after goals which invest 
 life with supreme value. To deepen the spiritual life of our people, 
 we must cultivate the traditional habit of communion with God through 
 prayer in both home and synagogue.
 
 </p><p>Judaism as a way of life requires in addition to its moral and 
 spiritual demands, the preservation of the Sabbath, festivals and Holy
 Days, the retention and development of such customs, symbols and 
 ceremonies as possess inspirational value, the cultivation of 
 distinctive forms of religious art and music and the use of Hebrew, 
 together with the vernacular, in our worship and instruction.
 
 </p><p>These timeless aims and ideals of our faith we present anew to a 
 confused and troubled world. We call upon our fellow Jews to 
 rededicate themselves to them, and, in harmony with all men, hopefully
 and courageously to continue Israel's eternal quest after God and His 
 kingdom.
