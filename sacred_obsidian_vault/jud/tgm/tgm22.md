 <p>"TODAY, I will tell you about Ki-Tov or Twas Good,"' Rabbi Meir said, as the children were gathering round him.</p>  
 <p>"Some time ago I stopped at a little inn in a country town. At night I heard the innkeeper call:</p>  
 <p>"'Get up, get up. Whoever will come now, I will take on my donkeys!' Most of the guests were very happy. It would spare them so much trouble. And think of all the time they would save. So I could hear them answer sleepily,</p>  
 <p>"'Wait, I'll hurry------'</p>  
 <p>"'Wait, wait, I'm coming,' and quickly they got into their clothes.</p>  
 <p>"Now I thought it was strange for the innkeeper who was not known as a generous man, to be so kind to his guests. Why should he take all of them on his</p>  
 <p></p>  
 <p>donkeys? Of course I could not be certain, but I knew that the innkeeper was not kind enough to do so much for his guests. I wanted to warn them not to go, but before I knew it they were all gone. Afterwards I learnt that the innkeeper had arranged with a band of robbers to wait for him in the thick of the woods. When the innkeeper's guests arrived, they were robbed and killed.</p>  
 <p>"So when the innkeeper called again, I said:</p>  
 <p>"'No, thank you, I appreciate your kindness, but I cannot go.'</p>  
 <p>"'Why not,' urged the innkeeper, 'tomorrow you will have to travel all that way on foot.'</p>  
 <p>"'I know, but I must wait for my brother.'</p>  
 <p>"'Where is he? Maybe I can get him for you now. What's his name?' anxiously asked the innkeeper.</p>  
 <p>"'Oh, he must be in some synagogue now, where the men are busy studying Torah. His name is Ki-Tov or Twas Good.'</p>  
 <p>"The innkeeper went away and searched in every synagogue. He called, 'Ki-Tov, Ki-Tov, Twas Good, Twas Good, your brother is waiting for you at my inn. Come out, come out, from wherever you are!' But all in vain. Ki-Tov did not answer.</p>  
 <p>"After his other guests had been robbed and killed, the innkeeper came home. By that time the sun</p>

 <p>had risen and I was not afraid to start on my journey. I packed up and said good-bye to the innkeeper.</p>  
 <p>"'Oh, you are going without your brother! I thought you were waiting for your brother Ki-Tov, last night.'</p>  
 <p>"'That's true. I didn't lie to you. My brother has already arrived.'</p>  
 <p>"'Where is he?' asked the innkeeper as he looked about him puzzled.'</p>  
 <p>"'Look up to the sky--do you see that big light-shedding sun? That's my brother, Twas Good or Ki-Tov. You see why I call him Ki-Tov or Twas Good? Because when God made the sun, he looked at it and said, "Ki-Tov--for Twas Good."'</p>  
 <p>"'So good-bye, dear Sir. I'm off with my brother, Twas Good.'"</p>  
 <p>The children all clapped their hands and laughed heartily.</p>
