                          HAGGADA FOR PESACH
                 ACCORDING TO CHABAD-LUBAVITCH CUSTOM

                 ----------------------------------

                            SHABBAT HAGADOL

The Shabbat preceding Pesach is called Shabbat Hagadol (the Great
Shabbat), because of the great miracle that occured that day.

          (The Israelites in Egypt prepared the Pesach-lamb on the
           tenth of Nissan (Exodus 12:3), which was the Shabbat
           preceding the exodus (on the fifteenth).

           When questioned by their neighbours, they explained that
           these lambs would be sacrificed on the fourteenth of
           Nissan, and the night thereafter G-d would slay the
           firstborn of Egypt.

           The firstborn of Egypt then approached their parents and
           Pharaoh, begging for the release of Israel so that they
           themselves would be spared.

           When this request was denied, they rose in armed revolt
           which resulted in the slaying of numerous enemies of
           Israel.)

On Shabbat Hagadol, after minchah, we recite the Haggadah from
"We were slaves" to "to atone for all our sins";  for that day
marks the beginning of the redemption and its miracles.

    ********************************************************************

                ORDER OF THE SEARCH AND REMOVAL OF CHAMETZ

             It is customary to put pieces of hard bread in
             various places some time before the search, so
             that the one who searches will find them.

             According to the Kabbalah, one should place 10 pieces.

             Before starting the search, the following blessing is
             recited:

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who has
sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning
the removal of chametz.

             One is to search by candlelight in all hidden
             places, even cracks in the floor.

             One is not to speak between the blessing and the
             beginning of the search, even concerning the search
             itself.

             Throughout the search one should not speak about
             anything that is not relevant to the search.

             Members of the household should stand nearby to hear
             the blessing, with each one then searching his own
             place without speaking in between.

             Take heed to search first in the room nearest
             the place where the blessing was heard, and not
             to go to another room immediately after the blessing.

             After the search one must be careful that the
             chametz retained to be eaten or to be burnt in the
             morning, be put in a safe place, so that it not be
             carried about and thereby crumbled and spread by
             children or rodents.

             After the search one must also nullify [the chametz
             he may have overlooked] and say:

All leaven and anything leavened that is in my possession,
which I have neither seen nor removed, and about which I am
unaware, shall be considered nullified and ownerless as the
dust of the earth.

             On the fourteenth of Nissan; in the fifth hour of
             the day, one should make a special fire and burn
             the chametz and nullify it.

             For the nullification of the daytime say:

All leaven and anything leavened that is in my possession,
whether I have seen it or not, whether I have observed it
or not, whether I have removed it or not, shall be considered
nullified and ownerless as the dust of the earth.

             The ten pieces are to be burnt, and the following
             is said during the burning of the chametz:

May it be Your will, L-rd, our G-d and G-d of our fathers,
that just as I remove the chametz from my house and from my
possession, so shall You remove all the extraneous forces.

Remove the spirit of impurity from the earth, remove our evil
inclination from us, and grant us a heart of flesh to serve
You in truth.

Make all the sitra achara, all the kelipot, and all wickedness
be consumed in smoke, and remove the dominion of evil from the
earth. Remove with a spirit of destruction and a spirit of
judgment all that distress the Shekhina, just as You destroyed
Egypt and its idols in those days, at this time. Amen, Selah.

                            -----------------

          On the 14th of Nissan after Mincha (afternoon Prayer)

                     ORDER OF THE PESACH OFFERING
               SAID AFTER THE MINCHA (AFTERNOON) PRAYER

           "We offer the words of our lips in place of the sacrifice
           of bullocks."

           The Minchah prayer is instead of the daily afternoon
           offering, and in the time of the Beit Hamikdash the Pesach
           offering was sacrificed after the daily afternoon offering.
           Thus it is appropriate to study the order of the Pesach
           offering after Minchah, and say the following:

                ---------------------------------------

The Pesach offering is brought from yearling male lambs or goats, and
slaughtered anywhere in the Temple court only after midday of the
fourteenth of Nissan, after the slaughtering of the daily afternoon
offering and after the afternoon cleaning of the cups of the menorah.

One should not slaughter the Pesach offering while chametz is in his
possession. If he slaughtered it before the daily afternoon offering,
it is acceptable, provided that someone stir the blood of the Pesach
offering so that it will not congeal until the blood of the daily
afternoon offering will have been sprinkled, and then the blood of
the Pesach offering is sprinkled once toward the base of the altar.

How is it done? The shochet slaughters it, and the first Kohen at the
head of the line receives it and hands it over to his colleague, and
his colleague to his colleague, and the Kohen nearest the altar
sprinkles it once toward the base of the altar.

He returns the empty vessel to his colleague, and his colleague to
his colleague, receiving first the full vessel and then returning
the empty one.

There were rows of silver vessels and rows of golden vessels, and
the vessels did not have flat bottoms, lest they set them down and
the blood become congealed.

Afterwards they hung the Pesach offering, flayed it completely,
tore it open, cleansed its bowels until the wastes were removed.

They took out the parts offered on the altar, namely, the fat that
is on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys with
the fat on them, and the tail up to the backbone, and placed them
in a ritual vessel.

The Kohen then salted them and burned them upon the altar, each
one individually.

The slaughtering, the sprinkling of its blood, the cleansing of
its bowels and the burning of its fat override the Shabbat, but
other things pertaining to it do not override the Shabbat.

Likewise, if [the fourteenth of Nissan] falls on Shabbat, the Pesach
offerings are not carried home, but one group remains with their
Pesach offerings on the Temple mount, the second group sits in the
chel [an area just outside the Temple court], and the third stands
in its place [in the courtyard].

After nightfall they go to their places and roast the Pesach offering.

The Pesach offering was slaughtered in three groups, each group
consisting of no less than thirty men.

The first group entered, the Temple court was filled, they closed [its
doors], and while they were slaughtering it and offering its parts on
the altar, they [the Levi'im] recited the Hallel; if they finished
[Hallel] before all sacrificed, they repeated it, and if they repeated
it [and were not finished yet], they recited it a third time.

Each time Hallel was recited, [the Kohanim] sounded three blasts
of the trumpet: tekiah, teruah, tekiah.

When the offering was ended, they opened the doors of the Temple
court, the first group went out and the second entered, and they
closed the doors of the Temple court.

When they finished, they opened the doors, the second group went
out and the third entered.

The procedure of each group was the same.

After they all had left, they washed the Temple court, even on
Shabbat, of the filth of the blood.

How was the washing done? A water duct passed through the Temple
court and had an outlet from the court.

When they wished to wash the floor, they shut the outlet and the
stream overflowed its sides until the water rose and flooded the
[floor] all around and all the blood and dirt of the court were
gathered to it.

Then they opened the outlet, everything flowed out and the floor
was completely clean; this is the honor of the Temple.

If the Pesach offering was found to be unfit, one did not fulfill
his obligation until he brings another one.

              This is a very brief description of the order of the
              Pesach offering. The G-d-fearing person should recite
              it in its proper time, that its recital shall be
              regarded in place of its offering.

              One should be concerned about the destruction of the
              Beit Hamikdash, and plead before G-d, the Creator of the
              universe, that He rebuild it speedily in our days; Amen.


         BLESSINGS FOR CANDLE LIGHTING ON EREV PESACH &amp; PESACH

Blessed are you, L-rd our G-d, King of the universe, who has
sanctified us with His commandments, and commanded us to kindle
the [Shabbos and] Yom Tov Light.

Blessed are you, L-rd our G-d, King of the universe, who has granted
us life, sustained us and enabled us to reach this occasion.

                ------------------------------------------

                         ORDER OF THE HAGGADA

             Prepare a ke'arah (tray) on the table, with three
             matzot one on the other: first the Yisrael, on it
             the Levi and on it the Kohen.

             Above all these place on the right side the zero'a
             (bone), and opposite to it - on the left side -
             the betzah (egg); below these, in the center,
             the maror; [lower still,] below the bone place
             the kharoset, and opposite the egg the karpat;
             [below these,] under the marror, put the khazeret
             used for korekh.

               The first cup of wine is poured and the Kidush is
               recited.

When the festival occurs on Shabbat, say first "The sixth day"

Prepare the meal of the supernal King. This is the meal of
the Holy One, blessed be He, and His Shechinah.

The sixth day. And the heavens and the earth and all their hosts were
completed. And on the seventh day G-d finished His work which He had
made, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had
made. And G-d blessed the seventh day and made it holy, for on it He
rested from all His work which G-d created to make.

When the festival begins on a weekday begin here:

Attention Gentlemen.

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who
creates the fruit of the vine.

Blessed are You, G-d, our G-d, King of the universe, who has chosen
us from among all people, and raised us above all tongues, and made
us holy through His commandments. And You, G-d, our G-d, have given
us in love (On Shabbat add: [Shabbaths for rest and]) festivals for
happiness, feasts and festive seasons for rejoicing (On Shabbat add:
[this Shabbat-day and]) the day of this Feast of Matzot and this
Festival of holy convocation, the Season of our Freedom (On Shabbat
add: [in love]), a holy convocation, commemorating the departure
from Egypt.  For You have chosen us and sanctified us from all the
nations, and You have given us as a heritage Your holy (On Shabbat
add: [Shabbat and]) Festivals (On Shabbat add: [in love and favor]),
in happiness and joy.  Blessed are You, G-d, who sanctifies (On
Shabbat add: [the Shabbat and]) Israel and the festive seasons.

Blessed are You, G-d, our G-d, King of the universe, who has granted
us life, sustained us, and enabled us to reach this occasion.

When the festival falls on Saturday night add the following BEFORE
the blessing "Who has granted us life" :

Blessed are You, G-d, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates
the lights of fire.

Blessed are You, G-d, our G-d, King of the universe, who makes a
distinction between sacred and profane, between light and darkness,
between Israel and the nations, between the seventh day and the six
work-days. You have made a distinction between the holiness of the
Shabbat and the holiness of the festival, and You have sanctified the
seventh day above the six work-days. You have set apart and made holy
Your people Israel with Your holiness. Blessed are You, G-d, who makes
a distinction between holy and holy.


        Drink the cup of wine while seated, reclining on the left
        side as a sign of freedom.


                               URECHATZ

             Wash the hands without reciting the blessing.

                                KARPAS

               Take less than a (1 .oz) kezayit of the karpas,
               dip it into salt-water or vinegar, and recite the
               following blessing:

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates
the fruit of the earth.

               When reciting this blessing have in mind that it
               is also for the bitter herbs (of maror and korech,
               to be eaten later on).

                                YACHATZ

               Take the middle matzah and break it into two,
               one piece larger than the other. The larger piece
               is set aside to serve as afikoman. The smaller
               piece is put back, between the two matzot.

                                MAGGID

             Raise the tray with the matzot and say:

This is the bread of affliction that our fathers ate in the land
of Egypt. Whoever is hungry, let him come and eat; whoever is in
need, let him come and conduct the Seder of Pesach. This year [we
are] here; next year in the land of Israel. This year [we are]
slaves; next year [we will be] free people.

             The tray with the matzot is moved aside, and the
             second cup is POURED. (Do not drink it yet)


             Now the child asks Mah Nishtana?


What makes this night different from all [other] nights?

On all nights we need not dip even once, on this night we
do so twice!

And on all nights we eat chametz or matzah, and on this
night only matzah.

On all nights we eat any kind of vegetables, and on this
night maror!

On all nights we eat sitting upright or reclining, and on
this night we all recline!

          The tray is restored to its place with the matzah partly
          uncovered.  Now we say  "We were slaves. . .":

We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the L-rd, our G-d, took us
out from there with a strong hand and with an outstretched arm.
If the Holy One, blessed be He, had not taken our fathers out of
Egypt, then we, our children and our children's children would have
remained enslaved to Pharaoh in Egypt. Even if all of us were wise,
all of us understanding, all of us knowing the Torah, we would still
be obligated to discuss the exodus from Egypt; and everyone who
discusses the exodus from Egypt at length is praiseworthy.

It happened that Rabbi Eliezer, Rabbi Yehoshua, Rabbi Elazar ben
Azaryah, Rabbi Akiva and Rabbi Tarphon were reclining [at a seder]
in B'nei Berak. They were discussing the exodus from Egypt all that
night, until their students came and told them: "Our Masters! The
time has come for reciting the morning Shema!"

Rabbi Eleazar ben Azaryah said: "I am like a man of seventy years
old, yet I did not succeed in proving that the exodus from Egypt must
be mentioned at night-until Ben Zoma explained it: "It is said, `That
you may remember the day you left Egypt all the days of your life;'
now `the days of your life' refers to the days, [and the additional
word] `all' indicates the inclusion of the nights!"

The sages, however, said: "`The days of your life' refers to the
present-day world; and `all' indicates the inclusion of the days
of Mashiach."

Blessed is the Omnipresent One, blessed be He! Blessed is He who gave
the Torah to His people Israel, blessed be He! The Torah speaks of
four children: One is wise, one is wicked, one is simple and one does
not know how to ask.

The wise one, what does he say? "What are the testimonies, the
statutes and the laws which the L-rd, our G-d, has commanded you?"
You, in turn, shall instruct him in the laws of Pesach, [up to]
`one is not to eat any dessert after the Pesach-lamb.'

The wicked one, what does he say? "What is this service to you?!"
He says `to you,' but not to him! By thus excluding himself from the
community he has denied that which is fundamental. You, therefore,
blunt his teeth and say to him: "It is because of this that the L-rd
did for me when I left Egypt"; `for me' - but not for him! If he had
been there, he would not have been redeemed!"

The simpleton, what does he say? "What is this?" Thus you shall say
to him: "With a strong hand the L-rd took us out of Egypt, from the
house of slaves."

As for the one who does not know how to ask, you must initiate him,
as it is said: "You shall tell your child on that day, `It is because
of this that the L-rd did for me when I left Egypt.'"

One may think that [the discussion of the exodus] must be from the
first of the month. The Torah therefore says, `On that day.'

`On that day,' however, could mean while it is yet daytime; the Torah
therefore says, `It is because of this.' The expression `because of
this' can only be said when matzah and maror are placed before you.

In the beginning our fathers served idols; but now the Omnipresent One
has brought us close to His service, as it is said: "Joshua said to
all the people: Thus said the L-rd, the G-d of Israel, `Your fathers
used to live on the other side of the river - Terach, the father of
Abraham and the father of Nachor, and they served other gods.

"And I took your father Abraham from beyond the river, and I led him
throughout the whole land of Canaan. I increased his seed and gave him
Isaac, and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave Mount Seir
to possess it, and Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt."

Blessed is He who keeps His promise to Israel, blessed be He! For the
Holy One, blessed be He, calculated the end [of the bondage], in order
to do as He had said to our father Abraham at the "Covenant between
the Portions," as it is said: "And He said to Abraham, `You shall know
that your seed will be strangers in a land that is not theirs, and
they will enslave them and make them suffer, for four hundred years.
But I shall also judge the nation whom they shall serve, and after
that they will come out with great wealth.'"

                   According to the instructions of Rabbi Isaac Luria,
                   the wine cup is now raised and the Matzot to be
                   covered.

This is what has stood by our fathers and us! For not just one alone
has risen against us to destroy us, but in every generation they rise
against us to destroy us; and the Holy One, blessed be He, saves us
from their hand!

                   Put down the wine cup and uncover the Matzah.

Go forth and learn what Laban the Aramean wanted to do to our father
Jacob. Pharaoh had issued a decree against the male children only,
but Laban wanted to uproot everyone - as it is said: "The Aramean
wished to destroy my father; and he went down to Egypt and sojourned
there, few in number; and he became there a nation - great and mighty
and numerous."

"And he went down to Egypt" forced by Divine decree. "And he sojourned
there" - this teaches that our father Jacob did not go down to Egypt
to settle, but only to live there temporarily. Thus it is said,
"They said to Pharaoh, We have come to sojourn in the land, for there
is no pasture for your servants' flocks because the hunger is severe
in the land of Canaan; and now, please, let your servants dwell in the
land of Goshen."

"Few in number" as it is said: "Your fathers went down to Egypt with
seventy persons, and now, the L-rd, your G-d, has made you as numerous
as the stars of heaven."

"And he became there a nation" this teaches that Israel was
distinctive there.

"Great, mighty," as it is said: "And the children of Israel were
fruitful and increased abundantly, and multiplied and became very,
very mighty, and the land became filled with them."

"And numerous," as it is said: "I passed over you and saw you
wallowing in your bloods, and I said to you `By your blood you
shall live,' and I said to you `By your blood you shall live!'
I caused you to thrive like the plants of the field, and you increased
and grew and became very beautiful your bosom fashioned and your hair
grown long, but you were naked and bare."

"The Egyptians treated us badly and they made us suffer, and they put
hard work upon us."

"The Egyptians treated us badly," as it is said: Come, let us act
cunningly with [the people] lest they multiply and, if there should
be a war against us, they will join our enemies, fight against us and
leave the land."

"And they made us suffer," as it is said: "They set taskmasters
over [the people of Israel] to make them suffer with their burdens,
and they built storage cities for Pharaoh, Pitom and Ramses."

"And they put hard work upon us," as it is said: "The Egyptians made
the children of Israel work with rigor. And they made their lives
bitter with hard work, with mortar and with bricks and all manner of
service in the field, all their work which they made them work with
rigor."

And we cried out to the L-rd, the G-d of our fathers, and the L-rd
heard our voice and saw our suffering, our labor and our oppression.

"And we cried out to the L-rd, the G-d of our fathers," as it is said:
"During that long period, the king of Egypt died; and the children of
Israel groaned because of the servitude, and they cried out. And their
cry for help from their servitude rose up to G-d."

"And the L-rd heard our voice" as it said: "And G-d heard their
groaning, and G-d remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac and
Jacob."

"And he saw our suffering," this refers to the separation of husband
and wife, as it is said: "G-d saw the children of Israel and G-d took
note."

"Our labor," this refers to the "children," as it is said: "Every boy
that is born, you shall throw into the river and every girl you shall
keep alive."

"And our oppression," this refers to the pressure, as it is said:
"I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them."

"The L-rd took as out of Egypt with a strong hand and an outstretched
arm, and with a great manifestation, and with signs and wonders."

"The L-rd took us out of Egypt," not through an angel, not through
a seraph and not through a messenger.

The Holy One, blessed be He, did it in His glory by Himself!

Thus it is said: "In that night I will pass through the land of Egypt,
and I will smite every first-born in the land of Egypt, from man to
beast, and I will carry out judgments against all the gods of Egypt,
I the L-rd."

"I will pass through the land of Egypt," I and not an angel;

"And I will smite every first-born in the land of Egypt," I and
not a seraph;

"And I will carry out judgments against all the gods of Egypt,"
I and not a messenger;

"I- the L-rd," it is I, and none other!

"With a strong hand," this refers to the dever (pestilence) as it
is said: "Behold, the hand of the L-rd will be upon your livestock
in the field, upon the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds
and the flocks, a very severe pestilence."

"And with an outstretched arm," this refers to the sword, as it
is said: "His sword was drawn, in his hand, stretched out over
Jerusalem."

"And with a great manifestation,' this refers to the revelation
of the Shekhinah (Divine Presence), as it is said: "Has any G-d ever
tried to take for himself a nation from the midst of another nation,
with trials, signs and wonders, with war and with a strong hand and
an outstretched arm, and with great manifestations, like all that the
L-rd your G-d, did for you in Egypt before your eyes!"

"And with signs," this refers to the staff, as it is said:
"Take into your hand this staff with which you shall perform
the signs."

"And wonders," this refers to the blood, as it is said: "And I shall
show wonders in heaven and on earth.

                 When saying the following words "blood, and fire,
                 and pillars of smoke," spill three times from the
                 wine in the cup. Do not remove wine by dipping a
                 finger, but by spilling from the cup itself, and do
                 so into a broken/chipped dish.
                 (Have in mind that the cup symbolizes the aspect
                 of malchut which contains an aspect of "anger and
                 indignation." By means of our faculty of binah
                 (understanding) we pour out [that aspect of
                 "anger and indignation" - by spilling from the
                 wine in the cup into a broken dish which represents
                 kelipah, i.e., that which is called accursed [the
                 principle of evil]).

Blood, and fire, and pilalrs of smoke."

Another explanation: "Strong hand" indicates two [plagues];
"Outstretched arm," another two; "Great manifestation," another two;
"Signs," another two; and "Wonders," another two.

These are the Ten Plagues which the Holy One, blessed be He, brought
upon the Egyptians, namely as follows:


                 When saying the ten plagues, spill from the cup
                 itself ten times, as stated above (and when spilling,
                 again have in mind what was said above).  The wine
                 remaining in the cup (will have become `wine that
                 causes joy,'  thus) is not to be spilled, but other
                 wine is added to it [to refill the cup].

Blood.
Frogs.
Lice.
Wild Beasts.
Pestilence.
Boils.
Hail.
Locust.
Darkness.
Slaying of the First-born.

Rabbi Yehudah referred to them by acronyms:
DeTzaCh                       (blood, frogs, lice);
ADaSh                         (beasts, pestilence, boils);
BeAChaB                       (hail, locust, darkness, first-born).


Rabbi Yosi the Gallilean said: How do you know that the Egyptians
were stricken by ten plagues in Egypt, and then were struck by
fifty plagues at the sea?

In Egypt it says of them, "The magicians said to Pharaoh `This is
the finger of G-d.' At the sea it says, "Israel saw the great hand
that the L-rd laid against Egypt; and the people feared the L-rd, and
they believed in the L-rd and in His servant Moses."

Now, how often were they smitten by `the finger'? Ten plagues!

Thus you must conclude that in Egypt they were smitten by ten plagues,
at the sea they were smitten by fifty plagues!

Rabbi Eliezer said: How do we know that each individual plague which
the Holy One, blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt
consisted of four plagues?

For it is said: "He sent against them His fierce anger, fury, and
indignation, and trouble, a discharge of messengers of evil":
`Fury,' is one; `Indignation,' makes two; `Trouble,' makes three;
`Discharge of messengers of evil,' makes four.

Thus you must now say that in Egypt they were struck by forty plagues,
and at the sea they were stricken by two hundred plagues.

Rabbi Akiva said: How do we know that each individual plague which the
Holy One, blessed be He, brought upon the Egyptians in Egypt consisted
of five plagues?

For it is said: "He sent against them his fierce anger, fury,
and indignation, and trouble, a discharge of messengers of evil":
"His fierce anger," is one; "fury," makes two; "indignation," makes
three; "trouble," makes four; "discharge of messengers of evil,"
makes five. Thus you must now say that in Egypt they were struck by
fifty plagues, and at the sea they were stricken by two hundred and
fifty plagues.

How many levels of favors has teh Omnipresent One bestowed upon us:

If He had brought us out from Egypt, and had not carried out judgments
against them Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had carried out judgments against them, and not against their
idols Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had destroyed their idols, and had not smitten their first-born
Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had smitten their first-born, and had not given us their wealth
Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had given us their wealth, and had not split the sea for us
Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had split the sea for us, and had not taken us through it on
dry land Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had taken us through the sea on dry land, and had not drowned
our oppressors in it Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had drowned our oppressors in it, and had not supplied our needs
in the desert for forty years Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had supplied our needs in the desert for forty years, and had
not fed us the manna Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had fed us the manna, and had not given us the Shabbat Dayenu,
it would have sufficed us!

If He had given us the Shabbat, and had not brought us before Mount
Sinai Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had brought us before Mount Sinai, and had not given us the
Torah Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had given us the Torah, and had not brought us into the land of
Israel Dayenu, it would have sufficed us!

If He had brought us into the land of Israel, and had not built for us
the Beit Habechirah (Chosen House; the Beit Hamikdash) Dayenu, it
would have sufficed us!

Thus how much more so should we be grateful to the Omnipresent One for
the doubled and redoubled goodness that He has bestowed upon us; for
He has brought us out of Egypt, and carried out judgments against
them, and against their idols, and smote their first-born, and gave us
their wealth, and split the sea for us, and took us through it on dry
land, and drowned our oppressors in it, and supplied our needs in the
desert for forty years, and fed us the manna, and gave us the Shabbat,
and brought us before Mount Sinai, and gave us the Torah, and brought
us into the land of Israel and built for us the Beit Habechirah to
atone for all our sins.

Rabban Gamliel used to say: Whoever does not discuss the following
three things on Pesach has not fulfilled his duty, namely: Pesach (the
Pesach-sacrifice), Matzah (the unleavened bread) and Maror (the bitter
herbs).

Pesach - the Pesach-lamb that our fathers ate during the time of
the Beit Hamikdash - for what reason [did they do so]?

Because the Omnipresent passed over our fathers' houses in Egypt,
as it is said:

"You shall say, It is a Pesach-offering to the L-rd, because He
passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt when He
struck the Egyptians with a plague, and He saved our houses. And
the people bowed and prostrated themselves."

             Take the broken matzah into your hand and say:

This matzah that we eat for what reason? Because the dough of our
fathers did not have time to become leavened before the King of the
kings of kings, the Holy One, blessed be He, revealed Himself to them
and redeemed them.

Thus it is said: "They baked matzah-cakes from the dough that they
had brought out of Egypt, because it was not leavened; for they had
been driven out of Egypt and could not delay, and they had also not
prepared any [other] provisions."

                   Take the maror into your hand and say:

This maror that we eat for what reason? Because the Egyptians
embittered our fathers' lives in Egypt, as it is said:
"They made their lives bitter with hard service, with mortar and with
bricks, and with all manner of service in the field; all their service
which they made them serve with rigor."


In every generation a person is obligated to regard himself as if he
had come out of Egypt, as it is said: "You shall tell your child on
that day, it is because of this that the L-rd did for me when I left
Egypt."

The Holy One, blessed be He, redeemed not only our fathers from Egypt,
but He redeemed also us with them, as it is said: "It was us that He
brought out from there, so that He might bring us to give us the land
that He swore to our fathers."

              Cover the Matzah and raise the cup. The cup is to be
              held in the hand until the completion of the blessing,
              "Who Has Redeemed Us..."


Thus it is our duty to thank, to laud, to praise, to glorify, to
exalt, to adore, to bless, to elevate and to honor the One who did all
these miracles for our fathers and for us. He took us from slavery to
freedom, from sorrow to joy, and from mourning to festivity, and from
deep darkness to great light and from bondage to redemption. Let us
therefore recite before Him Halleluyah, Praise G-d!

Halleluyah - Praise G-d! Offer praise, you servants of the L-rd;
praise the Name of the L-rd. May the L-rd's Name be blessed from now
and to all eternity. From the rising of the sun to its setting, the
L-rd's Name is praised. The L-rd is high above all nations, His glory
is over the heavens. Who is like the L-rd, our G-d, who dwells on high
yet looks down so low upon heaven and earth! He raises the poor from
the dust, He lifts the needy from the dunghill, to seat them with
nobles, with the nobles of His people. He restores the barren woman
to the house, into a joyful mother of children.  Halleluyah - praise
G-d.

When Israel went out of Egypt, the House of Jacob from a people of
a foreign language, Judah became His holy one, Israel His dominion.
The sea saw and fled, the Jordan turned backward. The mountains
skipped like rams, the hills like young sheep. What is with you, O
sea, that you flee; Jordan, that you turn backward? Mountains, why do
you skip like rams; hills, like a pool of water, the flint-stone into
a spring of water.


Blessed are You, G-d, our G-d, King of the universe, who has redeemed
us and redeemed our fathers from Egypt, and enabled us to attain this
night to eat matzah and maror. So too, G-d, our G-d and G-d of our
fathers, enable us to attain other holidays and festivals that will
come to us in peace with happiness in the rebuilding of Your city, and
with rejoicing in Your service [in the Bet Hamikdash]. Then we shall
eat {NOTE: if the festival is on any day except Saturday night say:
&gt;&gt; of the sacrifices and of the Pesach-offerings &lt;&lt;  if the Seder is
on Saturday Night say: &gt;&gt; of the Pesach-offerings and of the
sacrifices &lt;&lt; } whose blood shall be sprinkled on the wall of Your
altar for acceptance; and we shall thank You with a new song for our
redemption and for the deliverance of our souls.  Blessed are You,
G-d, who redeemed Israel.

              Recite the following blessing, and drink the cup in
              the reclining position:

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates the
fruit of the vine.

                               RACHTZAH

                 Now the hands are washed with recital of the blessing
                 for washing the hands.

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who has
sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning
the washing of the hands.

                  One should not speak until after making the
                  next 2 blessings and eating the Matza.


                                 MOTZI

                 Take the Matzot in the order that they are lying
                 on the tray - the broken piece between the two
                 whole Matzot; hold them in your hand and recite
                 the following blessing:

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who brings forth
bread from the earth.

                                MATZAH

                 Do not break anything off the Matzot.
                 First put down the third Matza (the bottom one),
                 and recite the following blessing over the broken
                 Matza and the top one.

                 When reciting the following blessing, have in mind
                 that it refers also to the eating of the `Sandwich'
                 of Korach - which will be made with the third Matza -
                 and also the eating of the Afikoman.

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who has
sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning
the eating of Matza.

                 Now break off a Kezayit of the 2 Matzot held, and
                 eat the 2 pieces together in reclining position.

                                 MAROR

                 Now take a Kezayit of the Maror, dip it into the
                 Kharoset -but then shake off the Kharoset that
                 stuck to it, so that the bitter taste will not be
                 neutralized.  Recite the following blessing:

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who has
sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us concerning
the eating of Maror.

                 Now eat the Maror, without reclining.

                                KORECH

                 Take the 3'rd Matza, and also a Kezyit of the
                 Khazeret - which is to be dipped into Kharoset.
                 Combine the two [like a sandwich], and say the
                 following:

Thus did Hilel do at the time of the Bet HaMikdash: He would combine
Pesach - lamb, Matza and Maror and eat them together, as it said:
"They shall eat it with Matza and bitter herbs."

                 Now eat them together - in the reclining position.

                            SHULCHAN ORECH

                 Now eat and drink according to you need.
                 It is permitted to drink wine between the
                 second and third cups.


                                TZAFUN

                 After the above, take the Afikoman and divide it
                 among all the members of the household, by giving
                 everyone a Kezayit.

                 Take care not to drink after the Afikoman.

                 It is to be eaten in the reclining position and this
                 ought to be done before midnight.


                                BERACH

                  The third cup is poured now, and recite Birkat
                  Hamazon (Blessing after the Meal) over it.


A Song of Ascents. When the L-rd will return the exiles of Zion, we
will have been like dreamers. Then our mouth will be filled with
laughter, and our tongue with joyous song. Then will they say among
the nations, "The L-rd has done great things for these." The L-rd has
done great things for us, we were joyful. L-rd, return our exiles as
streams in the Negev. Those who sow in tears will reap with joyous
song. He goes along weeping, carrying the bag of seed; he will surely
come [back] with joyous song, carrying his sheaves.

A Psalm by the sons of Korach, a song whose foundation is in the holy
mountains. The L-rd loves the gates of Zion more than all the dwelling
places of Jacob. Glorious things are spoken of you, O city of G-d. I
will make mention of Rahab and Babylon unto those that know me; behold
Philistia and Tyre, as well as Cush, "This one was born there." But of
Zion it will be said, "This man and that man was born there," and He,
the Most High, will establish it. The L-rd will count the register of
the nations, "This one was born there." Selah. Singers and dancers
alike [will chant], "All my inner thoughts are of you."

I will bless the L-rd at all times; His praise is always in my mouth.
The ultimate conclusion, all having been heard: fear G-d and observe
His commandments, for this is the whole of man. My mouth will utter
the praise of the L-rd, and all flesh shall bless His holy Name
forever and ever. And we will bless the L-rd from now and forever;
Halleluyah praise G-d.

                   Before mayim acharonim (washing fingers) the
                   following verse is said:

This is the portion of a wicked man from G-d, and the heritage
assigned to him by G-d.

               After mayim acharonim, the following verse is said:

And he said to me: This is the table that is before the L-rd.

           *** When the Grace after Meal is said with a quorum
           *** of three or more males over the age of 13,
           *** the leader begins:

Gentlemen, let us say Grace!

               The others respond:

May the Name of the L-rd be blessed from now and forever.

               The Leader [repeats the response and] continues:

With the permission of the masters, teachers and gentlemen, let us
bless He of whose bounty we have eaten.

               The others respond:

Blessed be He of whose bounty we have eaten.

               [The leader repeats this response.]

               Those present who did not partake of the meal respond:

      Blessed and praised be His Name always, forever and ever.

           *** If there is a quorum of ten males over the age
           *** of 13 then the the leader begins:

Gentlemen, let us say Grace!

               The others respond:

May the Name of the L-rd be blessed from now and forever.

               The Leader [repeats the response and] continues:

With the permission of the masters, teachers and gentlemen, let us
bless our G-d He of whose bounty we have eaten.

               The others respond:

Blessed be our G-d He of whose bounty we have eaten.

               [The leader repeats this response.]

               Those present who did not partake of the meal respond:

      Blessed be our G-d and praised be His Name always, forever and
      ever.

               All who ate, male and female recite the Grace:

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who, in His
goodness, feeds the whole world with grace, with kindness and with
mercy. He gives food to all flesh, for His kindness is everlasting.
Through His great goodness to us continuously we d o not lack food,
and may we never lack it, for the sake of His great Name. For He is
a [benevolent] G-d who feeds and sustains all, does good to all,
and prepares food for all His creatures whom He has created, as it
is said: You open Your hand and satisfy the desire of every living
thing. Blessed are You L-rd, who provides food for all.

We thank You, L-rd, our G-d, for having given as a heritage to our
fathers a precious, good and spacious land; for having brought us out,
L-rd our G-d, from the land of Egypt and redeemed us from the house of
slaves; for Your covenant which You have sealed in our flesh; for Your
Torah which You have taught us; for Your statutes which You have made
known to us; for the life, favor and kindness which You have
graciously bestowed upon us; and for the food we eat with which You
constantly feed and sustain us every day, at all times, and at every
hour.

For all this, L-rd our G-d, we thank You and bless You. May Your Name
be blessed by the mouth of every living being, constantly and forever.
As it is written: When you have eaten and are satiated, you shall
bless the L-rd your G-d, for the good land which He has given you.
Blessed are You, L-rd, for the land and for the food.

Have mercy, L-rd our G-d, upon Israel Your people, upon Jerusalem Your
city, upon Zion the abode of Your glory, upon the kingship of the
house of David Your anointed, and upon the great and holy House which
is called by Your Name. Our G-d, our Father, Our Shepherd, feed us,
sustain us, nourish us and give us comfort; and speedily, L-rd our
G-d, grant us relief from all our afflictions.  L-rd, our G-d, please
do not make us dependent upon the gifts of mortal men nor upon their
loans, but only upon Your full, open, holy and generous hand, that we
may not be shamed or disgraced forever and ever.

On Shabat add:

[May it please You, G-d, our G-d, to strengthen us through Your
commandments, and through the precept of the Seventh Day, this
great and holy Shabbat. For this day is great and holy before You,
to refrain from work and to rest thereon with love, in accordance
with the commandment of Your will. In Your will, G-d, our G-d, bestow
upon us tranquility, that there shall be no trouble, sadness or grief
on the day of our rest. G-d, our G-d, let us see the consolation of
Zion Your city, and the rebuilding of Jerusalem Your holy city, for
You are the Master of [all] salvations and the Master of [all]
consolations.]

Our G-d and G-d of our fathers, may there ascend, come and reach,
be seen and accepted, heard, recalled and remembered before You, the
remembrance and recollection of us, the remembrance of our fathers,
the remembrance of Mashiach the son of David Your servant, the
remembrance of Jerusalem Your holy city, and the remembrance of all
Your people the House of Israel, for deliverance, well-being, grace,
kindness, mercy, good life and peace, on this day of the Festival of
Matzot, on this Festival of holy convocation. Remember us on this
[day], L-rd, our G-d, for good; recollect us on this [day] for
blessing; help us on this [day] for good life. With the promise of
deliverance and compassion, spare us and be gracious to us; have mercy
upon us and deliver us; for our eyes are directed to You, for You,
G-d, are a gracious and merciful King.

Rebuild Jerusalem the holy city speedily in our days. Blessed are You,
L-rd, who in His mercy rebuilds Jerusalem. Amen.

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, benevolent G-d,
our Father, our King, our Might, our Creator, our Redeemer, our Maker,
our Holy One, the Holy One of Jacob, our Shepherd, the Shepherd of
Israel, the King who is good and does good to all, each and every day.
He has done good for us, He does good for us, and He will do good for
us; He has bestowed, He bestows, and He will forever bestow upon us
grace, kindness and mercy, relief, salvation and success, blessing and
help, consolation, sustenance and nourishment, compassion, life, peace
and all goodness; and may He never cause us to lack any good.

May the Merciful One reign over us forever and ever.
May the Merciful One be blessed in heaven and on earth.
May the Merciful One be praised for all generations, and be
    glorified in us forever and all eternity, and honored
    in us forever and ever.
May the Merciful One sustain us with honor.
May the Merciful One break the yoke of exile from our neck and
    may He lead us upright to our land.
May the Merciful One send abundant blessing into this house
    and upon this table at which we have eaten.
May the Merciful One send us Elijah the Prophet may he be
    remembered for good and may he bring us good tidings,
    salvation and consolation.
May the Merciful One bless my father, my teacher, the master of
    this house, and my mother, my teacher, the mistress of this
    house; them, their household, their children, and all that is
    theirs; us, and all that is ours. Just as He blessed our
    forefathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob, "in everything," "from
    everything," with "everything," so may He bless all of us (the
    children of the Covenant) together with a perfect blessing,
    and let us say, Amen.

From On High, may there be invoked upon him and upon us such merit
which will bring a safeguarding of peace. May we receive blessing from
the L-rd and just kindness from the G-d of our salvation, and may we
find grace and good understanding in the eyes of G-d and man.

(On Shabbat add: May the Merciful One cause us to inherit that day
                 which will be all Shabbat and rest for life
                 everlasting.)


May the Merciful One cause us to inherit that day which is all good.

May the Merciful One grant us the privilege of reaching the days of
the Mashiach and the life of the World to Come. He is a tower of
salvation to His king, and bestows kindness upon His anointed, to
David and his descendants forever. He who makes peace in His heights,
may He make peace for us and for all Israel; and say, Amen.

Fear the L-rd, you His holy ones, for those who fear Him suffer no
want. Young lions are in need and go hungry, but those who seek the
L-rd shall not lack any good. Give thanks to the L-rd for He is good,
for His kindness is everlasting. You open Your hand and satisfy the
desire of every living thing. Blessed is the man who trusts in the
L-rd, and the L-rd will be his trust.

               Recite the blessing for the wine, and drink in
               reclining position.

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates
the fruit of the vine.

               The fourth cup is poured and the door is opened.
               Say the following:


Pour out Your wrath upon the nations that do not acknowledge You, and
upon the kingdoms that do not call upon Your Name. For they have
devoured Jacob and laid waste his habitation. Pour out Your
indignation upon them, and let the wrath of Your anger overtake them.
Pursue them with anger, and destroy them from beneath the heavens of
the L-rd.

                            HALLEL NIRTZAH

Not to us, L-rd, not to us, but to Your Name give glory, for the
sake of Your kindness and Your truth. Why should the nations say,
"Where, now, is their G-d?" Our G-d is in heaven, whatever He desires,
He does. Their idols are of silver and gold, the product of human
hands: they have a mouth, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot
see; they have ears, but cannot hear; they have a nose, but cannot
smell; their hands cannot feel; their feet cannot walk; they can make
no sound with their throat. Like them should be their makers, everyone
that trusts in them. Israel, trust in the L-rd! He is their help and
their shield. House of Aaron, trust in the L-rd! He is their help and
their shield. You who fear the L-rd, trust in the L-rd!  He is their
help and their shield.

The L-rd, mindful of us, will bless. He will bless the House of
Israel; He will bless the House of Aaron; He will bless those who fear
the L-rd, the small with the great. May the L-rd increase [blessing]
upon you, upon you and upon your children. You are blessed unto the
L-rd, the Maker of heaven and earth. The heavens are the heavens of
the L-rd, but the earth He gave to the children of man.  The dead do
not praise G-d, nor do those that go down into the silence [of the
grave]. But we will bless G-d, from now to eternity.  Halleluyah
Praise G-d.

I love the L-rd, because He hears my voice, my prayers. For He turned
His ear to me; all my days I will call [upon Him]. The pangs of death
encompassed me, and the agonies of the grave came upon me, trouble and
sorrow I encounter and I call u upon the Name of the L-rd: Please,
L-rd, deliver my soul! The L-rd is gracious and just, our G-d is
compassionate. The L-rd watches over the simpletons; I was brought low
and He saved me. Return, my soul, to your rest, for the L-rd has dealt
kindly with you. For You have delivered my soul from death, my eyes
from tears, my foot from stumbling. I will walk before the L-rd in the
lands of the living. I had faith even when I said, "I am greatly
afflicted;" [even when] I said in my haste, "All men are deceitful."

What can I repay the L-rd for all His kindness to me? I will raise the
cup of salvation and call upon the Name of the L-rd. I will pay my
vows to the L-rd in the presence of all His people. Precious in the
eyes of the L-rd is the death of His pious ones. I thank you, L-rd,
for I am Your servant. I am Your servant the son of Your handmaid,
You have loosened my bonds. To You I will bring an offering of
thanksgiving, and I will call upon the Name of the L-rd. I will pay my
vows to the L-rd in the presence of all His people, in the courtyards
of the House of the L-rd, in the midst of Jerusalem.  Halleluyah
Praise G-d.

Praise the L-rd, all nations! Extol Him, all peoples! For His kindness
was mighty over us, and the truth of the L-rd is everlasting.
Halleluyah Praise G-d.

Give thanks to the L-rd, for He is good, for His kindness is
everlasting.
Let Israel say [it], for His kindness is everlasting.
Let the House of Aaron say [it], for His kindness is everlasting.
Let those who fear the L-rd say [it], for His kindness is everlasting.

Out of narrow confines I called to G-d; G-d answered me with abounding
relief. The L-rd is with me, I will not fear what can man do to me?
The L-rd is with me, through my helpers, and I can face my enemies. It
is better to rely on the L-rd, than to trust in man. It is better to
rely on the L-rd, than to trust in nobles. All nations surround me,
but I cut them down in the Name of the L-rd. They surrounded me, they
encompassed me, but I cut them down in the Name of the L-rd. They
surrounded me like bees, yet they are extinguished like a fire of
thorns; I cut them down in the Name of the L-rd. You [my foes] pushed
me again and again to fall, but the L-rd helped me. G-d is my strength
and song, and this has been my salvation. The sound of joyous song and
salvation is in the tents of the righteous: "The right hand of the
L-rd performs deeds of valor. The right hand of the L-rd is exalted;
the right hand of the L-rd performs deeds of valor!" I shall not die,
but I shall live and relate the deeds of G-d. G-d has chastised me,
but He did not give me over to death. Open for me the gates of
righteousness; I will enter them and give thanks to G-d. This is the
gate of the L-rd, the righteous will enter it.

I thank You for You have answered me, and You have been a help to me
(Repeat this verse).

The stone scorned by the builders has become the main cornerstone
(Repeat this verse).

This was indeed from the L-rd, it is wondrous in our eyes (Repeat this
verse).

This day the L-rd has made, let us be glad and rejoice on it (Repeat
this verse).

O L-rd, please help us! O L-rd, please help us!
O L-rd, please grant us success! O L-rd, please grant us success!

Blessed is he who comes in the Name of the L-rd; we bless you from the
House of the L-rd. (Repeat this verse).

The L-rd is Almighty, He gave us light; bind the festival-offering
until [you bring it to] the horns of the altar. (Repeat this verse)

You are my G-d and I will thank You; my G-d, I will exalt You. (Repeat
this verse)

Give thanks to the L-rd, for He is good, for His kindness is
everlasting. (Repeat this verse).

L-rd, our G-d, all Your works shall praise You; Your pious ones, the
righteous who do Your will, and all Your people, the House of Israel,
with joyous song will thank and bless, laud and glorify, exalt and
adore, sanctify and proclaim the sovereignty of Your Name, our King.
For it is good to thank You, and befitting to sing to Your Name, for
from the beginning to the end of the world You are Almighty G-d.
Give thanks to the L-rd, for He is good for His kindness is
everlasting;

Give thanks to the G-d of gods for His kindness is everlasting;
Give thanks to the L-rd of lords for His kindness is everlasting;
Who alone does great wonders for His kindness is everlasting;
Who made the heavens with understanding for His kindness is
everlasting;
Who stretched out the earth above the waters for His kindness
is everlasting;
Who made the great lights for His kindness is everlasting;
The sun, to rule by day for His kindness is everlasting;
The moon and stars, to rule by night for His kindness is everlasting;
Who struck Egypt through their first-born for His kindness is
everlasting; (yud)
And brought Israel out of their midst for His kindness is everlasting;
With a strong hand and with an outstretched arm for His kindness
is everlasting;
Who split the Sea of Reeds into sections for His kindness
is everlasting;
And led Israel through it for His kindness is everlasting;
And cast Pharaoh and his army into the Sea of Reeds for His kindness
is everlasting; (hey)
Who led His people through the desert for His kindness is everlasting;
Who struck great kings for His kindness is everlasting;
And slew mighty kings for His kindness is everlasting;
Sichon, king of the Amorites for His kindness is everlasting;
And Og, king of Bashan for His kindness is everlasting;
And gave their land as a heritage for His kindness is everlasting;
(vav)
A heritage to Israel, His servant for His kindness is everlasting;
Who remembered us in our lowliness for His kindness is everlasting;
And delivered us from our oppressors for His kindness is everlasting;
Who gives food to all flesh for His kindness is everlasting;
Thank the G-d of heaven for His kindness is everlasting. (hey)

The soul of every living being shall bless Your Name, L-rd, our G-d;
and the spirit of all flesh shall always glorify and exalt Your
remembrance, our King. From the beginning to the end of the world You
are Almighty G-d; and other than You we have no King, Redeemer and
Savior who delivers, rescues, sustains, answers and is merciful in
every time of trouble and distress; we have no King but You. [You are]
the G-d of the first and of the last [generations], G-d of all
creatures, L-rd of all events, who is extolled with manifold praises,
who directs His world with kindness and His creatures with compassion.
Behold, the L-rd neither slumbers nor sleeps. He arouses the sleepers
and awakens the slumberous, gives speech to the mute, releases the
bound, supports the falling and raises up those who are bowed. To You
alone we give thanks. Even if our mouths were filled with song as the
sea, and our tongues with joyous singing like the multitudes of its
waves, and our lips with praise like the expanse of the sky; and our
eyes shining like the sun and the moon, and our hands spread out like
the eagles of heaven, and our feet swift like deer we would still be
unable to thank You L-rd, our G-d and G-d of our fathers, and to bless
Your Name, for even one of the thousands of millions, and myriads of
myriads, of favors, miracles and wonders which You have done for us
and for our fathers before us. L-rd, our G-d. You have redeemed us
from Egypt, You have freed us from the house of bondage, You have fed
us in famine and nourished us in plenty; You have saved us from the
sword and delivered us from pestilence, and raised us from evil and
lasting maladies. Until now Your mercies have helped us, and Your
kindnesses have not forsaken us; and do not abandon us, L-rd our G-d,
forever! Therefore, the limbs which You have arranged within us, and
the spirit and soul which You have breathed into our nostrils, and the
tongue which You have placed in our mouth they all shall thank, bless,
praise , glorify, exalt, adore, sanctify and proclaim the sovereignty
of Your Name, our King. For every mouth shall offer thanks to You,
every tongue shall swear by You, every eye shall look to You, every
knee shall bend to You, all who stand erect shall, l bow down before
You, all hearts shall fear You, and every innermost part shall sing
praise to Your Name, as it is written: "All my bones will say, L-rd,
who is like You; You save the poor from one stronger than he, the poor
and the needy from one who would rob him!" Who can be likened to You,
who is equal to You, who can be compared to You, the great, mighty,
awesome G-d, G-d most high, Possessor of heaven and earth! We will
laud You, praise You and glorify You, and we will bless Your holy Name
e, as it is said: "[A Psalm] by David; bless the L-rd, O my soul, and
all that is within me [bless] His holy Name."

You are the Almighty G-d in the power of Your strength; the Great in
the glory of Your Name; the Mighty forever, and the Awesome in Your
awesome deeds; the King who sits upon a lofty and exalted throne.

He who dwells for eternity, lofty and holy is His Name. And it is
written: "Sing joyously to the L-rd, you righteous; it befits the
upright to offer praise." By the mouth of the upright You are exalted;
by the lips of the righteous You are blessed ; by the tongue of the
pious You are sanctified; and among the holy ones You are praised.

In the assemblies of the myriads of Your people, the House of Israel,
Your Name, our King, shall be glorified with song in every generation.
For such is the obligation of all creatures before You, L-rd, our G-d
and G-d of our fathers, to thank, to laud, to praise, to glorify, to
exalt, to adore, to bless, to elevate and to honor You, even beyond
all the words of songs and praises of David son of Yishai, Your
anointed servant.

And therefore may Your Name be praised forever, our King, the great
and holy G-d and King in heaven and on earth. For to You, L-rd, our
G-d and G-d of our fathers, forever befits song and praise, laud and
hymn, strength and dominion, victory, greatness and might, glory,
splendor, holiness and sovereignty; blessings and thanksgivings to
Your great and holy Name; from the beginning to the end of the world
You are Almighty G-d. Blessed are You, L-rd, Almighty G-d, King, great
and extolled in praises, G-d of thanksgivings, L-rd of wonders,
Creator of all souls, Master of all creatures, who takes pleasure in
songs of praise; the only King, the Life of all worlds.

               Those who have the custom to recite hymns [after
               the Seder] should not do so now, between this blessing
               and the one for the fourth cup. One must recite the
               blessing for the fourth cup immediately now:

Blessed are You, L-rd, our G-d, King of the universe, who creates
the fruit of the vine.

                     Drink in reclining position.

                     Concluding Blessing for the Wine:

Blessed are You, L-rd our G-d, King of the universe for the vine and
the fruit of the vine, for the produce of the field, and for the
precious, good and spacious land which You have favored to give as an
heritage to our fathers, to eat of its fruit and be satiated by its
goodness. Have mercy, L-rd our G-d, on Israel Your people, on
Jerusalem Your city, on Zion the abode of Your glory, on Your altar
and on Your Temple. Rebuild Jerusalem, the holy city, speedily in our
days, and bring us up into it, and make us rejoice in it, and we will
bless You in holiness and purity (On Shabbat add: May it please You to
strengthen us on this Shabbat day) and remember us for good on this day
of the Festival of Matzot.  For You, L-rd, are good and do good to
all, and we thank You for the land and for the fruit of the vine.
Blessed are You, L-rd, for the land and for the fruit of the vine.


Afterwards say:

                         NEXT YEAR IN JERUSALEM!
