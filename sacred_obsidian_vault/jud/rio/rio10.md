 <p>TALMUDIC literature may be said to have commenced with Ezra's redaction of the Pentateuch, about five hundred years before the common era. Its main object was the interpretation and codification of <i>The Law</i>. It covers a vast field, embraces almost the whole range of religion and law of some eight hundred years, and engages almost every prominent Babylonian and Palestinian Jewish teacher of that entire period.</p>  
 <p>Its greatest creative activity was during the life-time of Jesus, and during a century or so after. Its subject-matter for the most part deals with the religious, ceremonial, civil, and criminal law, but it abounds also in ethical teachings, of which quite a number have found their way into the New Testamentsomewhat altered in their expression by reason of the latter's use of the Greek tongue.

 <p>the very form and spirit of Talmud writings. The well known Golden Rule is a paraphrase of that of the famous President of the Sanhedrin, and head of the most celebrated academy of all Palestine, Rabbi Hillel, a forerunner of Jesus. The <i>Lord's Prayer</i> has the phrasing as well as the spirit of the prayers of the Talmudic Rabbis. The justly celebrated <i>Sermon on the Mount</i> of the New Testament contains many a parallel to the teachings of the Talmud.

 <p>44. For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man who is a householder,   which went out early in the morning to hire laborers into his vineyard. And   when he had agreed with the laborers for a penny a day, he sent them into his   vineyard. And he went out about the third hour and saw others standing idle   in the marketplace. And said unto them, Go ye also into the vineyard, and   whatsoever is right that shall ye receive. So when even was come, the lord of   the vineyard saith unto his steward, Call the laborers and give them their   hire, beginning from the last unto the first. And when they came that were   hired about the eleventh hour they received every man a penny. And when they   had received it they murmured against the good man of the house. Saying,   these last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast made them equal unto us,   which have borne the burden and heat of the day.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="50%">   
 <p>44. A king hired a number of laborers to work in his garden. Among them   there was one whose labor was greatly pleasing in the eyes of the king. After   observing him a while, he called him to his side, walked up and down with   him, engaged in pleasant converse. In the evening the laborers came for their   pay, and the king gave to each his day's wage. To him, whom he had called   from his labor early in the day, he gave as much as to them who had toiled   all the day. These were displeased, and complained of unfair treatment,   inasmuch as they had labored all day long, and had received no more than he   who had toiled but little.<br>   When the king learned of their displeasure, he said, This laborer has labored   in but a few hours as much as ye have accomplished in all the day.</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>
