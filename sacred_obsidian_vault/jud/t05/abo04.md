 <p><a name="page_xi"><font size="1" color="green">p. xi</font></a></p> <h4 align="CENTER">SECTION NEZIKIN (JURISPRUDENCE).</h4> <h5 align="CENTER">SYNOPSIS OF SUBJECTS</h5> <h6 align="CENTER">OF</h6> <h1 align="CENTER">TRACT ABOTH (FATHERS OF THE SYNAGOGUE).</h1> 
 <p>[Several requests have been received by the translator that an index should be made to the volumes of the Talmud, as is customary with all modern works. It would be an utter impossibility to give a complete index of everything contained in the Talmud. Were it like other scientific works, which treat each subject separately, this could easily be done; but with the Talmud it is different. On one page many different subjects may be discussed, and again a single subject may occupy several pages. The Talmud, therefore, has never had an index.</p> 
 <p>After careful examination of the volumes, page by page, it has been decided to make a synopsis, <i>i.e.</i>, to give briefly the heads of the discussions and conversations upon each Mishna, indicating the page where the Mishna is to be found, and the Gemara of each one, which serves as a commentary. By this the reader should be able to refer to what he desires to know.</p> 
 <p>A synopsis is therefore given of every Mishna which discusses a single subject, with its accompanying Gemara--in this volume, the Tosephtha; but when several short Mishnas cover the same subject, a single synopsis is given of the whole, including the Gemara of each one; and where a chapter is short, a synopsis of the whole chapter is made, without dividing it into Mishnas.</p> 
 <p>This is the best that can be done, and it is hoped that readers will find it satisfactory.]</p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER I.</h3> 
 <p>MISHNA <i>A</i>. The Great Assembly originated three maxims. Be deliberate in judgment. How so? The books of Proverbs, Song of Songs, and Ecclesiastes were hidden. How was Adam created? Why was Adam created on the last hour of the sixth day? On the same day on which he was formed, on the very same day his countenance was created. According to others: "Be deliberate in judgment" means not to have an irascible manner. Erect safeguards for the Law. The safeguard of the Lord, of Adam the First. The legend about Eve and the serpent, etc. The ten curses with which Eve was cursed at that time. "Shall I and my cattle eat out of the same trough?" The tradition about the ox of Adam, the steer of Noah, and the ram sacrificed by Abraham, <a href="abo05.htm#page_1">1</a>-<a href="abo05.htm#page_11">11</a></p>

 <p>CONTINUATION OF CHAPTER II. OF TOSEPHTHA.--What is the safeguard that the Torah made to its words? What Elijah the prophet answered the widow of the scholar who died in the prime of his life. What is the safe guard that Moses made to his words? The reason why Moses broke the Tables? What is the safeguard that Job made to his words? The safe guard that the prophets made to their words. The safeguard that the Hagiographers made to their words. The safeguard that the sages made to their words, <a href="abo05.htm#page_11">11</a>-<a href="abo05.htm#page_19">19</a></p> 
 <p>CONTINUATION OF CHAPTER III. OF TOSEPHTHA.--Whoever takes a coin from charity when not in need of it, etc. Study the Law in thy old age, even if thou hast studied it in thy youth. If you gave a coin to a poor man in the morning, and another one begs of you in the evening, give him also. What happened to a poor man with R. Aqiba. What happened to Benjamin the just, <a href="abo05.htm#page_19">19</a>-<a href="abo05.htm#page_21">21</a></p> 
 <p>MISHNA <i>B</i>. The motto of Simeon the Just. Upon the Torah, how so? Upon service, how so? Upon bestowal of favors, how so? Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai and Vespasian. In three things mankind differ one from the other, <a href="abo05.htm#page_22">22</a>-<a href="abo05.htm#page_26">26</a></p> 
 <p>MISHNAS <i>C</i> AND <i>D</i>. Be not like slaves who serve their masters for the sake of compensation. Let the fear of Heaven be upon you. Let your house be the meeting place of the wise. How did R. Aqiba begin his wonderful career? Not less astonishing was the literary career of R. Eliezer. How his father Hyrkanus reached the seats of Ben Zizith Ha Kesseth, Nakdimon b. Gurion, and Calba Shebua, <a href="abo05.htm#page_26">26</a>-<a href="abo05.htm#page_32">32</a></p> 
 <p>MISHNAS <i>E</i> AND <i>F</i>. Let thy house be wide open for the poor. When the great affliction came upon Job, he prayed, etc. Teach thy house humility--the different explanations of this saying. Get thee a wise teacher. Judge everyone from his favorable side. The legend about a maiden who was led into captivity and the pious men who went to redeem her. Not only were the upright of former times themselves very strict and particular, but also their cattle were so. The ass of R. Hanina b. Dosa, <a href="abo05.htm#page_32">32</a>-<a href="abo05.htm#page_38">38</a></p>

 <p>MISHNAS <i>H</i> TO <i>K</i>. Make thyself not as those that predispose the Judges. Love work--how so? Do not care for superiority. See to it that your name be not known to the Government. Ye wise, be guarded in your words. Love peace--how so? Moses desired to die the same death Aaron did--how so? The legend of the death of Moses, at length. Pursue peace--how so? Love all men too, and bring them nigh unto the Law, <a href="abo05.htm#page_41">41</a>-<a href="abo05.htm#page_50">50</a></p> 
 <p>MISHNAS <i>L</i> TO <i>Q</i>. If I do not look to myself, who will do so? And if not now, when? He who does not desire to learn from his masters is not worthy to live. He who increases not, decreases--how so? He who serves himself with a tiara perishes. Fix a time for study. Promise little and do much. Receive everyone with friendly countenance. Make a master to thyself. "I have never found anything better for a man than silence." Three things support the world. The disciples of Hillel; of R. Johanan b. Zakkai--what was said about them and what they used to say. The consolation of R. Johanan b. Zakkai by his disciples when his son died. Thy</p> 
 <p><a name="page_xiii"><font size="1" color="green">p. xiii</font></a></p>

 <p>MISHNAS <i>A</i> TO <i>M</i>. In choosing the right path, see that it is one which is honorable to thyself and without offence to others. All who occupy them selves with communal affairs should do it in the name of Heaven. Do His will as if it were thy own, that He may do thy will as if it were His. Pass not judgment upon thy neighbor until thou hast put thyself in his place. The boor can never fear sin, and the ignorant can never be truly pious. The more feasting the more food for worms. What is the best thing to cultivate. Which is the evil way a man should shun. Warm thyself before the light of the wise. An envious eye, evil propensities, and misanthropy drive a man out of the world. The legend about Joseph the Just, R. Zadoq, R. Aqiba, R. Eliezer the Great, etc. How difficult it is for man to avoid the evil propensities. Love everyone except the infidels, the enticers, the misleaders, and the informers. Thy neighbor's property must be as sacred as thine own, <a href="abo05.htm#page_58">58</a>-<a href="abo06.htm#page_65">65</a></p> 
 <p>MISHNA <i>N</i>. Set thyself to learn the Law. Johanan b. Zakkai and the daughter of Nakdimon b. Gurion. Let noble purpose underlie thy every action. The sages who were recounted of R.

 <p>MISHNAS <i>A</i> TO <i>V</i>. Consider three things, and you will not fall into transgression. Pray always for the welfare of the Government. Whoever takes the words of the Torah to his heart. Render unto God what belongs to Him, for thou and all thou hast are His. Whomsoever fear of sin precedes, his wisdom prevails. He whose works are in excess of his wisdom, his wisdom will endure. Be pliant with thy chief. Receive every man with cheerfulness. Mockery and frivolity are the forerunners of immorality. Everything is foreseen and free will is given. The world is judged by grace. All that we possess is merely a trust. Without knowledge of religion there can be no true culture, and without true culture there is no knowledge of religion. Qinim, canons, astronomy, and geometry are after-courses of wisdom, <a href="abo06.htm#page_70">70</a>-<a href="abo07.htm#page_81">81</a></p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER IV.</h3> 
 <p>MISHNAS <i>A</i> TO <i>P</i>. Who is a wise man? He who learns from everybody. Despise no man, and consider nothing as too far removed to come to pass. Be exceedingly lowly of spirit. Wear not the law of God as a crown to exalt thyself withal. Judge not alone, for none may judge alone save One. Whatsoever congregation is for the sake of Heaven will in the end succeed. Let the honor of thy disciple be as dear unto thee as the honor of thine associate.</p> 
 <p><a name="page_xiv"><font size="1" color="green">p. xiv</font></a></p> 
 <p>Be careful in thy study, for error in study counts for an intentional sin, <a href="abo07.htm#page_81">81</a>-<a href="abo08.htm#page_86">86</a></p> 
 <p>MISHNA <i>Q</i>. Neither the security of the wicked nor the afflictions of the righteous are within the grasp of our understanding. Be beforehand in saluting every man. Be the lion's tail rather than the fox's head. Do not seek to appease thy friend in the hour of his passion. Look not upon the pitcher, but upon what it contains. Envy, sensuality, and ambition destroy life. Accept not the assurance of thy passions, that the grave will be a place of refuge for thee. Without thy consent wert thou created, born into the world without thy choice. Thou art living without thine own volition, without thine approval thou wilt have to die. About the death of Eliezer the Great. Set something apart for charity, before you are compelled to do so by others. Lower thy seat two or three rows from the place you intend to occupy. There are three persons whose life is not worth living. The safeguard for honor is refraining from laughter. The safeguard for wisdom is silence. Whoever marries a woman not suitable to him transgresses five negative commandments. Do not be as the lintel, which no hand can reach, etc., <a href="abo08.htm#page_86">86</a>-<a href="abo08.htm#page_95">95</a></p> 
 <p>MISHNA <i>Q</i>. (continued). Those that despise me shall be lightly esteemed. The support of the wise, etc. Do not keep away from a precept which has no limit. Let the honor of thy disciple, etc. There is grain in Judea, straw in Galilee, and chaff on the other side of the Jordan. There is no love such as the love of the Torah. There is no wisdom such as the wisdom of manners. Whoever maintains peace in his own household, etc. The words of the Torah are as difficult to acquire as silken garments and are lost as easily as, etc. All those things which are done in private shall be done as if they were done publicly. Do not isolate thyself from the community. The disciples are divided into three classes, etc. Whoever constitutes the Torah as the chief good, and considers worldly affairs as a secondary thing, etc. Conciliate not thy friend in the hour of his anger. The scholars are divided into four classes . One studies but does not teach others, etc. If one honor his friend for pecuniary considerations, he will in the end be dismissed in disgrace, etc. On account of the four different means of forgiveness, etc. Repentance must be to every one of them. However, one who has profaned the name of heaven has not the power to repent. Wherefore do scholars die before their time. Be careful in greeting thy neighbor He who neglects the words of the Law on account of his riches. There is a case where one transgresses ignorantly, etc. One who connects himself with transgressors, etc. The punishment of the liar is that even when he tells the truth he is not believed, <a href="abo08.htm#page_95">95</a>-<a href="abo08.htm#page_103">103</a></p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER V.</h3> 
 <p>MISHNAS <i>A</i> TO <i>G</i>. By ten sayings the world was created. For what purpose is this stated? Whence is it deduced that a single person is equal to the whole creation?

By means of ten trials the Holy One, blessed be He, tested our forefathers.

Every day a Heavenly voice goes forth from Mount Horeb and proclaims as follows, etc. He who learns from his companion one chapter, etc., is bound to do him honor.
