 <p><a name="page_xxix"><font size="1" color="green">p. xxix</font></a></p> <h4 align="CENTER">SECTION MOED (FESTIVALS).</h4> <h3 align="CENTER">SYNOPSIS OF SUBJECTS</h3> <h6 align="CENTER">OF</h6> <h1 align="CENTER">VOLUME I.--TRACT SABBATH.</h1> <h3 align="CENTER">SYNOPSIS OF SUBJECTS.</h3> 
 <p>SEVERAL requests have been received by the translator that an index should be made to the volumes of the Talmud, as is customary with all modern works. It would be an utter impossibility to give a complete index of everything contained in the Talmud. Were it like other scientific works, which treat each subject separately, this could easily be done; but with the Talmud it is different. On one page many different subjects may be discussed, and again a single subject may occupy several pages. The Talmud, therefore, has never had an index, not even the portions which have been translated.</p> 
 <p>After careful examination of the volumes, page by page, it has been decided to make a synopsis, <i>i.e.</i>, to give briefly the heads of the discussions and conversations upon each Mishna, indicating the page where the Mishna is to be found, and the Gemara of each one, which serves as a commentary. By this the reader should be able to refer to what he desires to know.</p> 
 <p>A synopsis is therefore given of every Mishna which discusses a single subject, with its accompanying Gemara; but when several short Mishnas cover the same subject, a single synopsis is given of the whole, including the Gemara of each one; and where a chapter is short and has but one subject, a synopsis of the whole chapter is made, without dividing it into Mishnas.</p> 
 <p>This is the best that can be done, and it is hoped that readers will find it satisfactory.</p> <h3 align="CENTER">CHAPTER I.</h3>
