 The object of this essay is to say about the dogmas of Judaism a word
 which I think ought not to be left unsaid. 
 
 <p>In speaking of dogmas it must be understood that Judaism does not
 ascribe to them any saving power. The belief in a dogma or a doctrine
 without abiding by its real or supposed consequences (eg. the, belief in
 <i>creatio ex nihilo</i> without keeping the Sabbath) is of no value. And
 the question about certain doctrines is not whether they possess or do not
 possess the desired charm against certain diseases of the soul, but
 whether they ought to be considered as characteristics of Judaism or not. 
 
 </p><p>It must again be premised that the subject, which occupied the thoughts
 of the greatest and noblest Jewish minds for so many centuries, has been
 neglected for a comparatively long time. And this for various reasons.
 First, there is Mendelssohn's assertion, or supposed assertion, in his
 <i>Jerusalem</i>, that Judaism has no dogmas -- an assertion which has
 been accepted by the majority of modern Jewish theologians as the only
 dogma Judaism possesses. You can hear it pronounced in scores of Jewish
 pulpits; you can read it written in scores of Jewish books. To admit the
 possibility that Mendelssohn was in error was hardly permissible,
 especially for those with [p. 148] whom he enjoys a certain infallibility.
 Nay, even the fact that he himself was not consistent in his theory, and
 on another occasion declared that Judaism has dogmas, only that they are
 purer and more in harmony with reason than those of other religions; or
 even the more important fact that he published a school-book for children,
 in which the so-called Thirteen Articles were embodied, only that instead
 of the formula "I believe,"  he substituted "I am convinced," -- even such
 patent facts did not produce much effect upon many of our modern
 theologians. [n. 1] They were either overlooked or explained away so as to
 make them harmonise with the great dogma of dogmalessness. For it is one
 of the attributes of infallibility, that the words of its happy possessor
 must always be reconcilable even when they appear to the eye of the
 unbeliever as gross contradictions. 
 
 </p><p>Another cause of the neglect into which the subject has fallen is that
 our century is an <i>historical</i> one. It is not only books that have
 their fate, but also whole sciences and literatures. In past times it was
 religious speculation that formed the favorite study of scholars, in our
 time it is history with its critical foundation on a sound philology. Now
 as these two most important branches of Jewish science were so long
 neglected -- were perhaps never cultivated in the true meaning of the
 word, and as Jewish literature is so vast and Jewish history so
 far-reaching and eventful, we cannot wonder that these studies have
 absorbed the time and the labour of the greatest and best Jewish writers
 in this century. 
 
 </p><p>There is, besides, a certain tendency in historical studies that is
 hostile to mere theological speculation. The historian deals with
 realities, the theologian with abstrac- [p149] tions. The latter likes to
 shape the universe after his system, and tells us how things ought to be,
 the former teaches us how they are or have been, and the explanation he
 gives for their being so and not otherwise includes in most cases also a
 kind of justification for their existence. There is also the <i>odium
 theologicum</i>, which has been the cause of so much misfortune that it is
 hated by the historian, whilst the superficial, rationalistic way in which
 the theologian manages to explain everything which does not suit his
 system is most repulsive to the critical spirit. 
 
 </p><p>But it cannot be denied that this neglect has caused much confusion.
 Especially is this noticeable in England, which is essentially a
 theological country, and where people are but little prone to give up
 speculation about things which concern their most sacred interest and
 greatest happiness. Thus whilst we are exceedingly poor in all other
 branches of Jewish learning, we are comparatively rich in productions of a
 theological character. We have a superfluity of essays on such delicate
 subjects as eternal punishment, immortality of the soul, the day of
 judgment, etc., and many treatises on the definition of Judaism. But
 knowing little or nothing of the progress recently made in Jewish
 theology, of the many protests against all kinds of infallibility, whether
 canonised in this century or in olden times, we in England still maintain
 that Judaism has no dogmas as if nothing to the contrary had ever been
 said. We seek the foundation of Judaism in political economy, in hygiene,
 in everything except religion. Following the fashion of the day to esteem
 religion in proportion to its ability to adapt itself to every possible
 and impossible metaphysical and social system, we are [p. 150] anxious to
 squeeze out of Judaism the last drop of faith and hope, and strive to make
 it so flexible that we can turn it in every direction which it is our
 pleasure to follow. But alas! the flexibility has progressed so far as to
 classify Judaism among the invertebrate species, the lowest order of
 living things. It strongly resembles a certain Christian school which
 addresses itself to the world in general and claims to satisfy everybody
 alike.  It claims to be socialism for the adherents of Karl Marx and
 Lassalle, worship of man for the followers of Comte and St. Simon; it
 carefully avoids the word "God" for the comfort of agnostics and sceptics,
 whilst on the other hand it pretends to hold sway over paradise, hell, and
 immortality for the edification of believers. In such illusions many of
 our theologians delight.  For illusions they are; you cannot be everything
 if you want to be anything. Moreover, illusions in themselves are bad
 enough, but we are menaced with what is still worse. Judaism, divested of
 every higher religious motive, is in danger of falling into gross
 materialism. For what else is the meaning of such declarations as "Believe
 what you like, but conform to this or that mode of life"; what else does
 it mean but "We cannot expect you to believe that the things you are
 bidden to do are commanded by a higher authority;  there is not such a
 thing as belief, but you ought to do them for conventionalism or for your
 own convenience." 
 
 </p><p>But both these motives -- the good opinion of our neighbours, as well
 as our bodily health -- have nothing to do with our nobler and higher
 sentiments, and degrade Judaism to a matter of expediency or diplomacy.
 Indeed, things have advanced so far that well-meaning, but ill-advised
 writers even think to render a service to Judaism [p. 151] by declaring it
 to be a kind of enlightened Hedonism, or rather a moderate Epicureanism. 
 
 </p><p>I have no intention of here answering the question, What is Judaism ?
 This question is not less perplexing than the problem, What is God's
 world? Judaism is also a great Infinite, composed of as many endless
 Units, the Jews. And these Unit-Jews have been, and are still, scattered
 through all the world, and have passed under an immensity of influences,
 good and bad. If so, how can we give an exact definition of the Infinite,
 called Judaism? 
 
 </p><p>But if there is anything sure, it is that the highest motives which
 worked through the history of Judaism are the strong belief in God and the
 unshaken confidence that at last this God, the God of Israel, will be the
 God of the whole world; or, in other words, Faith and Hope are the two
 most prominent characteristics of Judaism. 
 
 </p><p>In the following pages I shall try to give a short account of the
 manner in which these two principles of Judaism found expression, from the
 earliest times down to the age of Mendelssohn; that is, to present an
 outline of the history of Jewish Dogmas. First, a few observations on the
 position of the Bible and the Talmud in relation to our theme.
 Insufficient and poor as they may be in proportion to the importance of
 these two fundamental documents of Judaism, these remarks may nevertheless
 suggest a connecting link between the teachings of Jewish antiquity and
 those of Maimonides and his successors. 
 
 </p><h4><a name="bible">[The Bible]</a></h4>
 <p>I begin with the Scriptures. 
 
 </p><p>The Bible itself hardly contains a command bidding us <i>to
 believe</i>. We are hardly ordered, <i>e.g.</i>, to believe in the
 existence of God.  I say hardly, but I do not altogether deny the
 existence of such a command.  It is true that we [p. 152] do not find in
 the Scripture such words as: "You are commanded to believe in the
 existence of God." Nor is any punishment assigned as awaiting him who
 denies it. Notwithstanding these facts, many Jewish authorities -- among
 them such important men as Maimonides, R. Judah Hallevi, Nachmanides --
 perceive, in the first words of the Ten Commandments, "I am the Lord thy
 God,"  the command to believe in His existence. [n. 2]
 
 </p><p>Be this as it may, there cannot be the shadow of a doubt that the
 Bible, in which every command is dictated by God, and in which all its
 heroes are the servants, the friends, or the ambassadors of God, presumes
 such a belief in every one to whom those laws are dictated, and these
 heroes address themselves. Nay, I think that the word "belief" is not even
 adequate.  In a world with so many visible facts and invisible causes, as
 life and death, growth and decay, light and darkness; in a world where the
 sun rises and sets; where the stars appear regularly; where heavy rains
 pour down from the sky, often accompanied by such grand phenomena as
 thunder and lightning; in a world full of such marvels, but into which no
 notion has entered of all our modern true or false explanations -- who but
 God is behind all these things? "Have the gates," asks God, "have the
 gates of death been open to thee? or hast thou seen the doors of the
 shadow of death? . . .Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for
 darkness, where is the place thereof ? . .  . Hath the rain a father? or
 who hath begotten the drops of dew? . . . Canst thou bind the sweet
 influences of Pleiades, or loose the bands of Orion ?  . . . Canst thou
 send lightnings, that they may go, and say unto thee, Here we are?" (Job
 xxxviii.). Of all these wonders, God, [p. 153] was not merely the <i>prima
 causa</i>; they were the result of His direct action, without any
 intermediary causes. And it is as absurd to say that the ancient world
 believed in God, as for a future historian to assert of the nineteenth
 century that it believed in the effects of electricity. We see them, and
 so antiquity saw God. If there was any danger, it lay not in the denial of
 the existence of a God, but in having a wrong belief.  Belief in as many
 gods as there are manifestations in nature, the investing of them with
 false attributes, the misunderstanding of God's relation to men, lead to
 immorality. Thus the greater part of the laws and teachings of the Bible
 are either directed against polytheism, with all its low ideas of God, or
 rather of gods; or they are directed towards regulating God's relation to
 men. Man is a servant of God, or His prophet, or even His friend. But this
 relationship man obtains only by his conduct. Nay, all man's actions are
 carefully regulated by God, and connected with His holiness. The 19th
 chapter of Leviticus, which is considered by the Rabbis as the portion of
 the Law in which the most important articles of the Torah are embodied, is
 headed, "Ye shall be holy, for I the Lord your own God am holy." And each
 law therein occurring, even those which concern our relations to each
 other, is not founded on utilitarian reasons, but is ordained because the
 opposite of it is an offence to the holiness of God, and profanes His
 creatures, whom He desired to be as holy as He is. [n. 3]
 
 </p><p>Thus the whole structure of the Bible is built upon the visible fact of
 the existence of a God, and upon the belief in the relation of God to men,
 especially to Israel. In spite of all that has been said to the contrary,
 the Bible does lay stress upon belief, where belief is required. The [p. 
 154] unbelievers are rebuked again and again.  "For all this they sinned
 still, and believed not for His wondrous work," complains Asaph (Ps. 
 lxxviii. 32). And belief is praised in such exalted words as, "Thus saith
 the Lord, I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine
 espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that
 was not sown" (Jer.ii. 2). The Bible, especially the books of the
 prophets, consists, in great part, of promises for the future, which the
 Rabbis justly termed the "Consolations." [n. 4] For our purpose, it is of
 no great consequence to examine what future the prophets had in view,
 whether an immediate future or one more remote, at the end of days. At any
 rate, they inculcated hope and confidence that God would bring to pass a
 better time. I think that even the most advanced Bible critic -- provided
 he is not guided by some modern Aryan reasons -- must perceive in such
 passages as, "The Lord shall reign for ever and ever," "The Lord shall
 rejoice n his works," and many others, a hope for more than the
 establishment of the "national Deity among his votaries in Palestine." 
 
 </p><p>We have now to pass over an interval of many centuries, the length of
 which depends upon the views held is to the date of the close of the
 canon, and examine what the Rabbis, the representatives of the prophets,
 thought on this subject.  Not that the views of the author of the
 <i>Wisdom of Solomon</i>, of Philo and Aristobulus, and many others of the
 Judaeo-Alexandrian school would be uninteresting for us. But somehow their
 influence on Judaism was only a passing one, and their doctrines never
 became authoritative in the Synagogue. We must here confine ourselves to
 those who, even by the [p. 155] testimony of their bitterest enemies,
 occupied the seat of Moses. 
 
 </p><p>The successors of the prophets had to deal with new circumstances, and
 accordingly their teachings were adapted to the wants of their times.  As
 the result of manifold foreign influences, the visible fact of the
 existence of God as manifested in the Bible had been somewhat obscured.
 Prophecy ceased, and the Holy Spirit which inspired a few chosen ones took
 its place. Afterwards this influence was reduced to the hearing of a Voice
 from Heaven, which was audible to still fewer. On the other hand the
 Rabbis had this advantage that they were not called upon to fight against
 idolatry as their predecessors the prophets had been. The evil inclination
 to worship idols was, as the Talmud expresses it allegorically, killed by
 the Men of the Great Synagogue, or, as we should put it, it was suppressed
 by the sufferings of the captivity in Babylon. This change of
 circumstances is marked by the following fact: -- Whilst the prophets
 mostly considered idolatry as the cause of all sin, the Rabbis show a
 strong tendency to ascribe sin to a defect in, or a want of, belief on the
 part of the sinner. They teach that Adam would not have sinned unless he
 had first denied the "Root of all" (or the main principle), namely, the
 belief in the Omnipresence of God.  Of Cain they say that before murdering
 his brother he declared: "There is no judgment, there is no judge, there
 is no world to come, and there is no reward for the just, and no
 punishment for the wicked." [n. 5]
 
 </p><p>In another place we read that the commission of a sin in secret is an
 impertinent attempt by the doer to oust God from the world. But if
 unbelief is considered as [p. 156] the root of all evil, we may expect
 that the reverse of it, a perfect faith, would be praised in the most
 exalted, terms. So we read: Faith is so great that the man who possesses
 it may hope to become a worthy vessel of the Holy Spirit, or, as we should
 express it, that he may hope to obtain by this power the highest degree of
 communion with his Maker. The Patriarch Abraham, notwithstanding all his
 other virtues, only became "the possessor of both worlds" by the merit of
 his strong faith. Nay, even the fulfilment of a single law when
 accompanied by true faith is, according to the Rabbis, sufficient to bring
 man nigh to God. And the future redemption is also conditional on the
 degree of faith shown by Israel. [n. 6]
 
 </p><p>It has often been asked what the Rabbis would have thought of a man who
 fulfils every commandment of the Torah, but does not believe that this
 Torah was given by God, or that there exists a God at all. It is indeed
 very difficult to answer this question with any degree of certainty. In
 the time of the Rabbis people were still too simple for such a diplomatic
 religion, and conformity in the modern sense was quite an unknown thing.
 But from the foregoing remarks it would seem that the Rabbis could not
 conceive such a monstrosity as atheistic orthodoxy. For, as we have seen,
 the Rabbis thought that unbelief must needs end in sin, for faith is the
 origin of all good. Accordingly, in the case just supposed they would have
 either suspected the man's orthodoxy, or would have denied that his views
 were really what he professed them to be. 
 
 </p><h4><a name="mishnah">[The Mishnah]</a></h4>
 <p>Still more important than the above cited Agadic passages is one which
 we are about to quote from the tractate Sanhedrin. This tractate deals
 with the constitution of the supreme law-court, the examination of the
 witnesses, the functions of the judges, and the different punishment to be
 inflicted on the transgressors of the law. After having enumerated various
 kinds of capital punishment, the Mishnah adds the following words:
 
 </p><blockquote>"These are (the men) who are excluded from the life to come:
 He who says there is no resurrection from death; he who says there is no
 Torah given from heaven, and the Epikurus. [n. 7]</blockquote>
 
 This passage was considered by the Rabbis of the Middle Ages, as well as
 by modern scholars, the <i>locus classicus</i> for the dogma question.
 There are many passages in the Rabbinic literature which exclude man from
 the world to come for this or that sin. But these are more or less of an
 Agadic (legendary) character, and thus lend themselves to exaggeration and
 hyperbolic language. They cannot, therefore, be considered as serious
 legal dicta, or as the general opinion of the Rabbis. 
 
 <p>The Mishnah in Sanhedrin, however, has, if only by its position in a
 legal tractate, a certain Halachic (obligatory) character. And the fact
 that so early an authority as R. Akiba made additions to it guarantees its
 high antiquity. The first two sentences of this Mishnah are clear enough. 
 In modern language, and positively speaking, they would represent articles
 of belief in Resurrection and Revelation. Great difficulty is found in
 defining what was meant by the word <i>Epicurus</i>. The authorities of
 the Middle Ages, to whom I shall again have to refer, explain the Epikurus
 to be a man who denies the belief in reward and punishment; others
 identify him with one who denies the belief in Providence; while others
 again consider the Epikurus to be one who denies Tradition. But the paral-
 [p. 158] lel passages in which it occurs incline one rather to think that
 this word cannot be defined by one kind of heresy. It implies rather a
 frivolous treatment of the words of Scripture or of Tradition. In the case
 of the latter (Tradition) it is certainly not honest difference of opinion
 that is condemned; for the Rabbis themselves differed very often from each
 other, and even Mediaeval authorities, did not feel any compunction about
 explaining Scripture in variance with the Rabbinic interpretation, and
 sometimes they even went so far as to declare that the view of this or
 that great authority was only to be considered as an isolated opinion not
 deserving particular attention. What they did blame was, as already said,
 scoffing and impiety. We may thus safely assert that reverence for the
 teachers of Israel formed the third essential principle of Judaism. [n. 8]
 
 </p><p>I have still to remark that there occur in the Talmud such passages as
 "the Jew, even if he has sinned, is still a Jew," or "He who denies
 idolatry is called a Jew." These and similar passages have been used to
 prove that Judaism was not a positive religion, but only involved the
 negation of idolatry. But it has been overlooked that the statements
 quoted have more a legal than a theological character. The Jew belonged to
 his nationality even after having committed the greatest sin, just as the
 Englishman does not cease to be an Englishman -- in regard to treason and
 the like -- by having committed a heinous crime. But he has certainly
 acted in a very un-English way, and having outraged the feelings of the
 whole nation will have to suffer for his misconduct. The Rabbis in a
 similar manner did not maintain that he who gave up the belief in
 Revelation and Resurrection, and treated irreverently the teach- [p.  159]
 ers of Israel, severed his connection with the Jewish nation, but that,
 for his crime, he was going to suffer the heaviest punishment. He was to
 be excluded from the world to come. 
 
 </p><p>Still, important as is the passage quoted from Sanhedrin, it would be
 erroneous to think that it exhausted the creed of the Rabbis. The liturgy
 and innumerable passages in the Midrashim show that they ardently clung to
 the belief in the advent of the Messiah. All their hope was turned to the
 future redemption and the final establishment of the Kingdom of Heaven on
 earth. Judaism, stripped of this belief, would have been for them devoid
 of meaning. The belief in reward and punishment is also repeated again and
 again in the old Rabbinic literature. A more emphatic declaration of the
 belief in Providence than is conveyed by the following passages is hardly
 conceivable. "Everything is foreseen, and free will is given. And the
 world is judged by grace." Or, "the born are to die, and the dead to
 revive, and the living to be judged. For to know and to notify, and that
 it may be known that He (God) is the Framer and He the Creator, and He the
 Discerner, and He the judge, and He the Witness," etc. [n. 9]
 
 </p><p>But it must not be forgotten that it was not the habit of the Rabbis to
 lay down, either for conduct or for doctrine, rules which were commonly
 known. When they urged the three points stated above there must have been
 some historical reason for it. Probably these principles were controverted
 by some heretics. Indeed, the whole tone of the passage cited from
 Sanhedrin is a protest against certain unbelievers who are threatened with
 punishment. Other beliefs, not less essential, but less disputed, remain
 [p. 160] unmentioned, because there was no necessity to assert them. 
 
 </p><h4><a name="caraites">[The Caraites]</a></h4>
 <p>It was not till a much later time, when the Jews came into closer
 contact with new philosophical schools, and also new creeds which were
 more liable than heathenism was to be confused with Judaism, that this
 necessity was felt. And thus we are led at once to the period when the
 Jews became acquainted with the teachings of the Mohammedan schools. The
 Caraites came very early into contact with non-Jewish systems. And so we
 find that they were also the first to formulate Jewish dogmas in a fixed
 number, and in a systematic order. It is also possible that their
 separation from the Tradition, and their early division into little sects
 among themselves, compelled them to take this step, in order to avoid
 further sectarianism. 
 
 </p><p>The number of their dogmas amounts to ten. According to Judah Hadasi
 (150), who would appear to have derived them from his predecessors, their
 dogmas include the following articles: 
 
 </p><p></p><ol>
 <li><i>Creatio ex nihilo</i>;
 </li><li>The existence of a Creator, God;
 </li><li>This God is an absolute unity as well as incorporeal;
 </li><li>Moses and the other prophets were sent by God;
 </li><li>God has given to us the Torah, which is true and complete in every
 respect, not wanting the addition of the so-called Oral Law;
 </li><li>The Torah must be studied by every Jew in the original (Hebrew) 
 language;
 </li><li>The Holy Temple was a place elected by God for His manifestation;
 </li><li>Resurrection of the dead;
 </li><li>Punishment and reward after death;
 </li><li>The Coming of the Messiah, the son of David.
 </li></ol>
 
 How far the predecessors of Hadasi were influenced by a certain Joseph
 Albashir (about 950), of whom there exists a manuscript work, "Rudiments
 of Faith," I am unable to [p. 161] say. The little we know of him reveals
 more of his intimacy with Arabic thoughts than of his importance for his
 sect in particular and for Judaism in general. After Hadasi I shall
 mention here Elijah Bashazi, a Caraite writer of the end of the fifteenth
 century. This author, who was much influenced by Maimonides, omits the
 second and the seventh articles. In order to make up the ten he numbers
 the belief in the eternity of God as an article, and divides the fourth
 article into two. In the fifth article Bashazi does not emphasize so
 strongly the completeness of the Torah as Hadasi, and omits the portion
 which is directed against Tradition. It is interesting to see the
 distinction which Bashazi draws between the Pentateuch and the Prophets.
 While he thinks that the five books of Moses can never be altered, he
 regards the words of the Prophets as only relating to their
 contemporaries, and thus subject to changes. As I do not want to
 anticipate Maimonides' system, I must refrain from giving here the
 articles laid down by Solomon Troki in the beginning of the eighteenth
 century. For the articles of Maimonides are copied by this writer with a
 few slight alterations so as to dress them in a Caraite garb. 
 
 <p>I must dismiss the Caraites with these few remarks, my object being
 chiefly to discuss the dogmas of the Synagogue from which they had
 separated themselves. Besides, as in everything Caraitic, there is no
 further development of the question. As Bashazi laid them down, they are
 still taught by the Caraites of to-day. I return to the Rabbanites. [n.10]
 
 </p><h4><a name="saadiah">[Saadiah]</a></h4>
 <p>As is well known, Maimonides (1130-1205), was the first Rabbanite who
 formulated the dogmas of the Synagogue. But there are indications of
 earlier attempts. R. Saadiah [p. 162] Gaon's (892-942) work, <i>Creeds and
 Opinions</i>, shows such traces.  He says in his preface, "My heart
 sickens to see that the belief of my co-religionists is impure and that
 their theological views are confused." The subjects he treats in this
 book, such as
 </p><p>
 </p><ul>
 <li>creation,
 </li><li>unity of God,
 </li><li>resurrection of the dead,
 </li><li>the future redemption of Israel,
 </li><li>reward and punishment,
 </li></ul>
 
 and other kindred theological subjects might thus, perhaps, be considered
 as the essentials of the creed that the Gaon desired to present in a pure
 and rational form. R. Hannaneel, of Kairowan, [n. 11] in the first half of
 the eleventh century, says in one of his commentaries that to deserve
 eternal life one must believe in <i>four</i> things: 
 <p>
 </p><ol>
 <li>in God,
 </li><li>in the prophets,
 </li><li>in a future world where the just will be rewarded,
 </li><li>and in the advent of the Redeemer.
 </li></ol>
 
 From R. Judah Hallevi's <i>Cusari</i>, written in the beginning of the
 twelfth century, we might argue that the belief in the election of Israel
 by God was the cardinal dogma of the author. [n. 12] Abraham Ibn Daud, a
 contemporary of Maimonides, in his book <i>The High Belief</i>, [n.  13]
 speaks of <i>rudiments</i>, among which, besides such metaphysical
 principles as unity, rational conception of God's attributes, etc., the
 belief in the immutability of the Law, etc., is included. Still, all these
 works are intended to furnish evidence from philosophy or history for the
 truth of religion rather than to give a definition of this truth. The
 latter task was undertaken by Maimonides. 
 
 <h4><a name="maimonides">[Maimonides]</a></h4>
 <p>I refer to the thirteen articles embodied in his first work, <i>The
 Commentary to the Mishnah</i>. They are appended to the Mishnah in
 Sanhedrin, with which I dealt above. But though they do not form an
 independent treatise, Maimonides remarks must not be considered as merely
 incidental. [p. 163] That Maimonides was quite conscious of the importance
 of this exposition can be gathered from the concluding words addressed to
 the reader:
 
 </p><blockquote>"Know these (words) and repeat them many times, and think
 them over in the proper way. God knows that thou wouldst be deceiving
 thyself if thou thinkest thou hast understood them by having read them
 once or even ten times. Be not, therefore, hasty in perusing them. I have
 not composed them with out deep study and earnest reflection."</blockquote>
 
 <p>The result of this deep study was that the following Thirteen Articles
 constitute the creed of Judaism. They are: --
 </p><p>
 </p><ol>
 <li>The belief in the existence of a Creator;
 </li><li>The belief in His Unity;
 </li><li>The belief in His Incorporeality;
 </li><li>The belief in His Eternity;
 </li><li>The belief that all worship and adoration are due to Him alone;
 </li><li>The belief in Prophecy;
 </li><li>The belief that Moses was the greatest of all Prophets, both 
 before and
 after him;
 </li><li>The belief that the Torah was revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai;
 </li><li>The belief in the Immutability of this revealed Torah;
 </li><li>The belief that God knows the actions of men;
 </li><li>The belief in Reward and Punishment;
 </li><li>The belief in the coming of the Messiah;
 </li><li>The belief in the Resurrection of the dead.
 </li></ol>
 
 The impulse given by the great philosopher and still ,greater Jew was
 eagerly followed by succeeding generations, and Judaism thus came into
 possession of a dogmatic literature such as it never knew before
 Maimonides. Maimonides is the centre of this literature, and I shall
 accordingly speak in the remainder of this essay of Maimonists and
 Anti-Maimonists.  These terms really apply to the great controversy that
 raged round Maimonides <i>Guide of</i> [p. 164] <i>the Perplexed</i>, but
 I shall, chiefly for brevity's sake, employ them in these pages in a
 restricted sense to refer to the dispute concerning the Thirteen Articles. 
 
 <p>Among the Maimonists we may probably include the great majority of
 Jews, who accepted the Thirteen Articles without further question. 
 Maimonides must indeed have filled up a great gap in Jewish theology, a
 gap, moreover, the existence of which was very generally perceived. A
 century had hardly elapsed before the Thirteen Articles had become a theme
 for the poets of the Synagogue. And almost every country where Jews lived
 can show a poem or a prayer founded on these Articles. R. Jacob Molin
 (1420) of Germany speaks of metrical and rhymed songs in the German
 language, the burden of which was the Thirteen Articles, and which were
 read by the common people with great devotion. The numerous commentaries
 and homilies written on the same topic would form a small library in
 themselves. [n. 14] But on the other hand it must not be denied that the
 Anti-Maimonists, that is to say those Jewish writers who did not agree
 with the creed formulated by Maimonides, or agreed only in part with him,
 form also a very strong and respectable minority. They deserve our
 attention the more as it is their works which brought life into the
 subject and deepened it. It is not by a perpetual Amen to every utterance
 of a great authority that truth or literature gains anything. 
 
 </p><h4><a name="anti">[The Anti-Maimonists]</a></h4>
 <p>The Anti-Maimonists can be divided into two classes. The one class
 categorically denies that Judaism has dogmas. I shall have occasion to
 touch on this view when I come to speak of Abarbanel. Here I pass at once
 to the second class of Anti-Maimonists. This consists of those who agree
 with Maimonides as to the existence of dogmas [p. 165] in Judaism, but who
 differ from him as to what these dogmas are, or who give a different
 enumeration of them. 
 
 </p><p>As the first of these Anti-Maimonists we may regard Nachmanides, who,
 in his famous <i>Sermon in the Presence of the King</i>, speaks of three
 fundamental principles: 
 
 </p><p></p><ul>
 <li>Creation (that is, non-eternity of matter),
 </li><li>Omniscience of God, and
 </li><li>Providence.
 </li></ul>
 
 Next comes R. Abba Mari ben Moses, of Montpellier. He wrote at the
 beginning of the fourteenth century, and is famous in Jewish history for
 his zeal against the study of philosophy. We possess a small pamphlet by
 him dealing with our subject, and it forms a kind of prologue to his
 collection of controversial letters against the rationalists of his time.
 [n.  15] He lays down three articles as the fundamental teachings of
 Religion: 
 
 <p></p><ol>
 
 <li>Metaphysical: The existence of God, including His Unity and
 Incorporeality; 
 
 </li><li>Mosaic: <i>Creatio ex nihilo</i> by God -- a consequence of this
 principle is the belief that God is capable of altering the laws of nature
 at His pleasure; 
 
 </li><li>Ethical: Special Providence -- <i>i.e.</i>, God knows all our actions
 in all their details. 
 
 </li></ol>
 
 Abba Mari does not mention Maimonides' Thirteen Articles. But it would be
 false to conclude that he rejected the belief in the coming of the
 Messiah, or any other article of Maimonides. The whole tone and tendency
 of this pamphlet is polemical, and it is therefore probable that he only
 urged those points which were either doubted or explained in an unorthodox
 way by the sceptics of his time. 
 
 <p>Another scholar, of Provence, who wrote but twenty years later than
 Abba Mari -- R. David ben Samuel d'Estella (1320) -- speaks of the seven
 pillars of religion. They are: 
 
 </p><p></p><ul>
 <li>Revelation,
 </li><li>Providence,
 </li><li>Reward and Punishment, [p. 166]
 </li><li>the Coming of the Messiah,
 </li><li>Resurrection of the Dead,
 </li><li>Creatio ex nihilo, and
 </li><li>Free Will. [n. 16]
 </li></ul>
 
 Of authors living, in other countries, I have to mention here R.
 Shemariah, of Crete, who flourished at about the same time as R. David
 d'Estella, and is known from his efforts to reconcile the Caraites with
 the Rabbanites. This author wrote a book for the purpose of furnishing
 Jewish students with evidence for what he considered the five fundamental
 teachings of Judaism, viz.: 
 
 <p></p><ol>
 <li>The Existence of God;
 </li><li>The Incorporeality of God;
 </li><li>His Absolute Unity;
 </li><li>That God created heaven and earth;
 
 </li><li>That God created the world after His will 5106 years ago -- 5106 (1346
 A.C.), being the year in which Shemariah wrote these words. [n. 17]
 
 </li></ol>
 
 In Portugal, at about the same time, we find R. David ben Yom-Tob Bilia
 adding to the articles of Maimonides thirteen of his own, which he calls
 the "Fundamentals of the Thinking Man." Five of these articles relate to
 the functions of the human soul, that, according to him, emanated from
 God, and to the way in which this divine soul receives its punishment and
 reward. The other eight articles are as follows: 
 
 <p></p><ol>
 <li>The belief in the existence of spiritual beings -- angels;
 </li><li><i>Creatio ex nihilo</i>;
 
 </li><li>The belief in the existence of another world, and that this other
 world is only a spiritual one; 
 
 </li><li>The Torah is above philosophy;
 
 </li><li>The Torah has an outward (literal) meaning and an inward (allegorical)
 meaning; 
 
 </li><li>The text of the Torah is not subject to any emendation;
 
 </li><li>The reward of a good action is the good work itself, and the doer must
 not expect any other reward; 
 
 </li><li>It is only by the "commands relating to the heart," for instance, the
 belief in one eternal God, the loving and fearing Him, and [p. 167] not
 through good actions, that man attains the highest degree of perfection.
 [n. 18]
 
 </li></ol> 
 
 Perhaps it would be suitable to mention here another contemporaneous
 writer, who also enumerates twenty-six articles. The name of this writer
 is unknown, and his articles are only gathered from quotations by later
 authors. It would seem from these quotations that the articles of this
 unknown author consisted mostly of statements emphasising the belief in
 the attributes of God: as, His Eternity, His Wisdom and Omnipotence, and
 the like.  [n.19]
 
 <p>More important for our subject are the productions of the fifteenth
 century, especially those of Spanish authors. The fifteen articles of R.
 Lipman Muhlhausen, in the preface to his well-known <i>Book of Victory</i>
 [n. 20] (1410), differ but slightly from those of Maimonides. In
 accordance with the anti-Christian tendency of his polemical book, he lays
 more stress on the two articles of Unity and Incorporeality, and makes of
 them four. We can therefore dismiss him with this short remark, and pass
 at once to the Spanish Rabbis. 
 
 </p><h4><a name="chasdai">[Chasdai]</a></h4>
 <p>The first of these is R. Chasdai Ibn Crescas, who composed his famous
 treatise, <i>The Light of God</i>, about 1405. Chasdai's book is well
 known for its attacks on Aristotle, and also for its influence on Spinoza. 
 But Chasdai deals also with Maimonides' Thirteen Articles, to which he was
 very strongly opposed. Already in his preface he attacks Maimonides for
 speaking, in his <i>Book of the Commandments</i>, of the belief in the
 existence of God as an "affirmative precept." Chasdai thinks it absurd;
 for every commandment must be dictated by some authority, but on whose
 authority can we dictate the acceptance of this authority? His general
 objection to the Thirteen Articles [p. 168] is that Maimonides confounded
 dogmas or fundamental beliefs of Judaism, without which Judaism is
 inconceivable, with beliefs or doctrines which Judaism inculcates, but the
 denial of which, though involving a strong heresy, does not make Judaism
 impossible.  He maintains that if Maimonides meant only to count
 fundamental teachings, there are not more than seven; but that if he
 intended also to include doctrines, he ought to have enumerated sixteen.
 As beliefs of the first class -- namely, fundamental beliefs -- he
 considers the following articles: 
 
 </p><p></p><ol>
 <li>God's knowledge of our actions;
 </li><li>Providence;
 </li><li>God's omnipotence -- even to act against the laws of nature;
 </li><li>Prophecy;
 </li><li>Free will;
 
 </li><li>The aim of the Torah is to make man long after the closest communion
 with God. 
 
 </li></ol>
 
 The belief in the existence of God, Chasdai thinks, is an axiom with which
 every religion must begin, and he is therefore uncertain whether to
 include it as a dogma or not. As to the doctrines which every Jew is bound
 to believe, but without which Judaism is not impossible, Chasdai divides
 them into two sections: 
 
 <em>(a)</em>
 <ol>
 <li>Creatio ex nihilo;
 </li><li>Immortality of the soul;
 </li><li>Reward and Punishment;
 </li><li>Resurrection of the dead;
 </li><li>Immutability of the Torah;
 </li><li>Superiority of the prophecy of Moses;
 
 </li><li>That the High Priest received from God the instructions sought for,
 when he put his questions through the medium of the Urim and Thummim; 
 
 </li><li>The coming of the Messiah.
 </li></ol>
 
 <em>(b)</em>Doctrines which are expressed by certain religious ceremonies,
 and on belief in which these ceremonies are conditioned: 
 
 <p></p><ol>
 
 <li>The belief in the efficacy of prayer as well as in the power of the
 benediction of the priests to convey to us the blessing of God; 
 
 </li><li>God is merciful to the penitent;
 
 </li><li>Certain days in the year -- for instance, [p. 169] the Day of
 Atonement -- are especially qualified to bring us near to God, if we keep
 them in the way we are commanded. </li></ol>
 
 That Chasdai is a little arbitrary in the choice of his "doctrines," I
 need hardly say. Indeed, Chasdai's importance for the dogma-question
 consists more in his critical suggestions than in his positive results. He
 was, as we have seen, the first to make the distinction between
 fundamental teachings which form the basis of Judaism, and those other
 simple Jewish doctrines without which Judaism is not impossible. Very
 daring is his remark, when proving that Reward and Punishment, Immortality
 of the soul, and Resurrection of the dead must not be considered as the
 basis of Judaism, since the highest ideal of religion is to serve God
 without any hope of reward. Even more daring are his words concerning the
 Immutability of the Law. He says:  "Some have argued that, since God is
 perfection, so must also His law be perfect, and thus unsusceptible of
 improvement." But he does not think this argument conclusive, though the
 fact in itself (the Immutability of the Law) is true. For one might answer
 that this perfection of the Torah could only be in accordance with the
 intelligence of those for whom it was meant; but as soon as the recipients
 of the Torah have advanced to a higher state of perfection, the Torah must
 also be altered to suit their advanced intelligence. A pupil of Chasdai
 illustrates the words of his master by a medical parallel.  The physician
 has to adapt his medicaments to the various stages through which his
 patient has to pass. That he changes his prescription does not, however,
 imply that his medical knowledge is imperfect, or that his earlier
 remedies were ignorantly chosen; the varying condition of the invalid was
 the cause of the variation [p. 170] in the doctor's treatment. Similarly,
 were not the Immutability of the Torah a "doctrine," one might maintain
 that the perfection of the Torah would not be inconsistent with the
 assumption that it was susceptible of modification, in accordance with our
 changing and progressive circumstances. But all these arguments are purely
 of a theoretic character; for, practically, every Jew, according to
 Chasdai, has to accept all these beliefs) whether he terms them
 fundamental teachings or only Jewish doctrines. [n. 21]
 
 <p>Some years later, though he finished his work in the same year as
 Chasdai, R. Simeon Duran (1366-1444,) a younger contemporary of the
 former, made his researches on dogmas. His studies on this subject form a
 kind of introduction to his commentary on Job, which he finished in the
 year I405. Duran is not so strongly opposed to the Thirteen Articles as
 Chasdai, or as another "thinker of our people," who thought them an
 arbitrary imitation of the thirteen attributes of God. Duran tries to
 justify Maimonides; but nevertheless he agrees with "earlier authorities,"
 who formulated the Jewish creed in Three Articles -- The Existence of God,
 Revelation, and Reward and Punishment -- under which Duran thinks the
 Thirteen Articles of Maimonides may be easily classed. Most interesting
 are his remarks concerning the validity of dogmas. He tells us that only
 those are to be considered as heretics who abide by their own opinions,
 though they know that they are contradictory to the views of the Torah.
 Those who accept the fundamental teachings of Judaism, but are led by
 their deep studies and earnest reflection to differ in details from the
 opinions current among their co-religionists, and explain certain passages
 [p. 171] in the Scripture in their own way, must by no means be considered
 as heretics. We must, therefore, Duran proceeds to say, not blame such men
 as Maimonides, who gave an allegorical interpretation to certain passages
 in the Bible about miracles, or R. Levi ben Gershom, who followed certain
 un-Jewish views in relation to the belief in <i>Creatio ex nihilo</i>.
 Only the views are condemnable, not those who cherish them.  God forbid,
 says Duran, that such a thing should happen in Israel as to condemn honest
 inquirers on account of their differing opinions. It would be interesting
 to know of how many divines as tolerant as this persecuted Jew the
 fifteenth century can boast. [n. 21]
 
 </p><h4><a name="albo">[Albo]</a></h4>
 <p>We can now pass to a more popular but less original writer on our
 theme. I refer to R. Joseph Albo, the author of the <i>Roots</i>, [n. 23]
 who was the pupil of Chasdai, a younger contemporary of Duran, and wrote
 at a much later period than these authors. Graetz has justly denied him
 much originality. The chief merit of Albo consists in popularising other
 people's thoughts, though he does not always take care to mention their
 names. And the student who is a little familiar with the contents of the
 <i>Roots</i> will easily find that Albo has taken his best ideas either
 from Chasdai or from Duran.  As it is of little consequence to us whether
 an article of faith is called "stem," or "root," or "branch,"  there is
 scarcely anything fresh left to quote in the name of Albo.  The late Dr.
 Low, of Szegedin, was indeed right, when he answered an adversary who
 challenged him -- "Who would dare to declare me a heretic as long as I
 confess the Three Articles laid down by Albo?"  with the words "Albo
 himself." For, after all the subtle distinctions Albo makes between [p. 
 172] different classes of dogmas, he declares that every one who denies
 even the immutability of the Law or the coming of the Messiah, which are,
 according to him, articles of minor importance, is a heretic who will be
 excluded from the world to come. But there is one point in his book which
 is worth noticing. It was suggested to him by Maimonides, indeed; still
 Albo has the merit of having emphasised it as it deserves. Among the
 articles which he calls "branches" Albo counts the belief that the
 perfection of man, which leads to eternal life, can be obtained by the
 fulfilling of one commandment.  But this command must, as Maimonides
 points out, be done without any worldly regard, and only for the love of
 God. When one considers how many platitudes are repeated year by year by
 certain theologians on the subject of Jewish legalism, we cannot lay
 enough stress on this article of Albo, and we ought to make it better
 known than it has hitherto been. [n. 24]
 
 </p><p>Though I cannot enter here into the enumeration of the Maimonists, I
 must not leave unmentioned the name of R. Nissim ben Moses of Marseilles,
 the first great Maimonist, who flourished about the end of the thirteenth
 century, and was considered as one of the most enlightened thinkers of his
 age. [n. 25] Another great Maimonist deserving special attention is R.
 Abraham ben Shem-Tob Bibago, who may perhaps be regarded as the most
 prominent among those who undertook to defend Maimonides against the
 attacks of Chasdai and others. Bibago wrote <i>The Path of Belief</i>
 [n.26] in the second half of the fifteenth century, and was, as Dr.
 Steinschneider aptly describes him, a <i>Denkglaubiger</i>. But, above
 all, he was a believing Jew. When he was once asked, at the table of King
 [p. 173] John II., of Aragon, by a Christian scholar, "Are you the Jewish
 philosopher?" he answered, "I am a Jew who believes in the Law given to us
 by our teacher Moses, though I have studied philosophy." Bibago was such a
 devoted admirer of Maimonides that he could not tolerate any opposition to
 him. He speaks in one passage of the prudent people of his time who, in
 desiring to be looked upon as orthodox by the great mob, calumniated the
 Teacher (Maimonides), and depreciated his merits. Bibago's book is very
 interesting, especially in its controversial parts; but in respect to
 dogmas he is, as already said, a Maimonist, and does not contribute any
 new point on our subject. 
 
 </p><p>To return to the Anti-Maimonists of the second half of the fifteenth
 century. As such may be considered R. Isaac Aramah, who speaks of three
 foundations of religion: 
 </p><p>
 </p><ul>
 <li><i>Creatio ex nihilo</i>,
 </li><li>Revelation (?),
 </li><li>and the belief in a world to come. [n. 27]
 </li></ul>
 
 Next to be mentioned is R. Joseph Jabez, who also accepts only three
 articles: 
 <p>
 </p><ul>
 <li><i>Creatio ex nihilo,</i>
 </li><li>Individual Providence, and
 </li><li>the Unity of God. [n. 22]
 </li></ul>
 
 Under these three heads he tries to classify the Thirteen Articles of
 Maimonides. 
 
 <h4><a name="abarbanel">[Abarbanel]</a></h4>
 <p>The last Spanish writer on our subject is R. Isaac Abarbanel. His
 treatise on the subject is known under the title <i>Top of Amanah</i> [n.
 29] and was finished in the year 1495. The greatest part of this treatise
 forms a defence of Maimonides, many points in which are taken from Bibago.
 But, in spite of this fact, Abarbanel must not be considered a Maimonist.
 It is only a feeling of piety towards Maimonides, or perhaps rather a
 fondness for argument, that made him defend Maimonides against Chasdai and
 others. His own view is that it is a mistake [p. 174] to formulate dogmas
 of Judaism, since every word in the Torah has to be considered as a dogma
 for itself. It was only, says Abarbanel, by following the example of
 non-Jewish scholars that Maimonides and others were induced to lay down
 dogmas. The non-Jewish philosophers are in the habit of accepting in every
 science certain indisputable axioms from which they deduce the
 propositions which are less evident. The Jewish philosophers in a similar
 way sought for first principles in religion from which the whole of the
 Torah ought to be considered as a deduction. But, thinks Abarbanel, the
 Torah as a revealed code is under no necessity of deducing things from
 each other, for all the commandments came from the same divine authority,
 and, therefore, are alike evident, and have the same certainty. On this
 and similar grounds Abarbanel refused to acccept dogmatic articles for
 Judaism, and he this became the head of the school that forms a class by
 itself among the anti- Maimonists to which many of the great Cabbalists
 belong. But it is idle talk to cite this school in aid of the modern
 theory that Judaism has no dogmas. As we have seen, it was rather an
 <i>embarras de riches</i> that prevented Abarbanel from accepting the
 Thirteen Articles of Maimonides. To him and to the Cabbalists the Torah
 consists of at least 613 Articles. 
 
 </p><p>Abarbanel wrote his book with which we have just dealt, at Naples.  And
 it is Italy to which, after the expulsion of the Jews from Spain, we have
 to look chiefly for religious speculation. But the philosophers of Italy
 are still less independent of Maimonides than their predecessor in Spain. 
 Thus we find that R. David Messer Leon, R. David Vital, and others were
 Maimonists. 
 </p><h4><a name="delmedigo">[Delmedigo]</a></h4>
 <p>[p. 175] Even the otherwise refined and original thinker, R. Elijah
 Delmedigo (who died about the end of the fifteenth century) becomes almost
 impolite when he speaks of the adversaries of Maimonides in respect to
 dogmas. "It was only," he says, "the would-be philosopher that dared to
 question the articles of Maimonides. Our people have always the bad habit
 of thinking themselves competent to attack the greatest authorities as
 soon as they have got some knowledge of the subject. Genuine thinkers,
 however, attach very little importance to their objections." [n. 30]
 
 </p><p>Indeed, it seems as if the energetic protests of Delmedigo scared away
 the Anti-Maimonists for more than a century. Even in the following
 seventeenth century we have to notice only two Anti-Maimonists. The one is
 R.  Tobijah, the Priest (1652), who was of Polish descent, studied in
 Italy, and lived as a medical man in France. He seems to refuse to accept
 the belief in the Immutability of the Torah, and in the coming of the
 Messiah, as fundamental teachings of Judaism. [n. 31] The other, at the
 end of the seventeenth century (1695), is R. Abraham Chayim Viterbo, of
 Italy.  He accepts only six articles: 
 
 </p><p></p><ol>
 <li>Existence of God;
 </li><li>Unity;
 </li><li>Incorporeality;
 
 </li><li>That God was revealed to Moses on Mount Sinai, and that the prophecy
 of Moses is true; 
 
 </li><li>Revelation (including the historical parts of the Torah);
 </li><li>Reward and Punishment.
 </li></ol>
 
 As to the other articles of Maimonides, Viterbo, in opposition to other
 half-hearted Anti-Maimonists, declares that the man who denies them is not
 to be considered as a heretic ; though he ought to believe them. [n. 32]
 
 <p>I have now arrived at the limit I set to myself at the beginning of
 this essay. For, between the times of [p. 176] Viterbo and those of
 Mendelssohn, there is hardly to be found any serious opposition to
 Maimonides worth noticing here. Still I must mention the name of R. Saul
 Berlin (died 1794); there is much in his opinions on dogmas which will
 help us the better to understand the Thirteen Articles of Maimonides. As
 the reader has seen, I have refrained so far from reproducing here the
 apologies which were made by many Maimonists in behalf of the Thirteen
 Articles. For, after all their elaborate pleas, none of them was able to
 clear Maimonides of the charge of having confounded dogmas or fundamental
 teachings with doctrines. It is also true that the Fifth Article -- that
 prayer and worship must only be offered to God -- cannot be considered
 even as a doctrine, but as a simple precept. And there are other
 difficulties which all the distinctions of the Maimonists will never be
 able to solve. The only possible justification is, I think, that suggested
 by a remark of R. Saul. This author, who was himself -- like his friend
 and older contemporary Mendelssohn -- a strong Anti-Maimonist, among other
 remarks, maintains that dogmas must never be laid down but with regard to
 the necessities of the time. [n. 33]
 
 </p><p>Now R. Saul certainly did not doubt that Judaism is based on eternal
 truths which can in no way be shaken by new modes of thinking or changed
 circumstances. What he meant was that there are in every age certain
 beliefs which ought to be asserted more emphatically than others, without
 regard to their theological or rather logical importance. It is by this
 maxim that we shall be able to explain the articles of Maimonides. He
 asserted them, because they were necessary for his time. 
 
 </p><p>[p. 177]We know, for instance, from a letter of his son and from other
 contemporaries, that it was just at his time that the belief in the
 incorporeality of God was, in the opinion of Maimonides, a little relaxed.
 Maimonides, who thought such low notions of the Deity dangerous to
 Judaism, therefore laid down an article against them. He tells us in his
 <i>Guide</i> that it was far from him to condemn any one who was not able
 to demonstrate the Incorporeality of God, but he stigmatised as a heretic
 one who refused to believe it. This position might be paralleled by that
 of a modern astronomer who, while considering it unreasonable to expect a
 mathematical demonstration of the movements of the earth from an ordinary
 unscientific man, would yet regard the person who refused to believe in
 such movements as an ignorant faddist. 
 
 </p><p>Again, Maimonides undoubtedly knew that there may be found in the
 Talmud -- that bottomless sea with its innumerable undercurrents --
 passages that are not quite in harmony with his articles; for instance,
 the well-known dictum of R. Hillel, who said, there is no Messiah for
 Israel -- a passage which has already been quoted <i>ad nauseam</i> by
 every opponent of Maimonides from the earliest times down to the year of
 grace 1896. Maimonides was well aware of the existence of this and similar
 passages. But, being deeply convinced of the necessity of the belief in a
 future redemption of Israel -- in opposition to other creeds which claim
 this redemption exclusively for their own adherents -- Maimonides simply
 ignored the saying of R. Hillel, as an isolated opinion which contradicts
 all the consciousness and traditions of the Jew as expressed in thousands
 of other passages, and [p. 178] especially in the liturgy. Most
 interesting is Maimonides' view about such isolated opinions in a letter
 to the wise men of Marseilles. He deals there with the question of free
 will and other theological subjects. After having stated his own view he
 goes on to say: 
 
 </p><blockquote>"I know that it is possible to find in the Talmud or in
 the Midrash this or that saying in contradiction to the views you have
 heard from me. But you must not be troubled by them.  One must not refuse
 to accept a doctrine, the truth of which has been proved, on account of
 its being in opposition to some isolated opinion held by this or that
 great authority. Is it not possible that he overlooked some important
 considerations when he uttered this strange opinion ? It is also possible
 that his words must not be taken literally, and have to be explained in an
 allegorical way. We can also think that his words were only to be applied
 with regard to certain circumstances of his time, but never intended as
 permanent truths. . . .  No man must surrender his private judgment.  The
 eyes are not directed backwards but forwards."</blockquote>
 
  In another place Maimonides calls the suppression of one's own opinions
 for the reason of their being irreconcilable with the isolated views of
 some great authority -- a moral suicide. 
 
 <p>By such motives Maimonides was guided when he left certain views
 hazarded in the Rabbinic literature unheeded, and followed what we may
 perhaps call the religious instinct, trusting to his own conscience.  We
 may again be certain that Maimonides was clear-headed enough to see that
 the words of the Torah: "And there arose no prophet since in Israel like
 unto Moses"  (Deut. xxxiv. 10), were as little intended to imply a
 doctrine as the passage relating to the king Josiah, "And like unto [p. 
 179] him was there no king before him that turned to the Lord with all his
 heart . . . neither after him arose there any like him" (2 Kings xxiii.
 25).  And none would think of declaring the man a heretic who should
 believe another king to be as pious as Josiah. But living among followers
 of the "imitating creeds" (as he calls Christianity and Mohammedism), who
 claimed that their religion had superseded the law of Moses, Maimonides,
 consciously or unconsciously, felt himself compelled to assert the
 superiority of the prophecy of Moses. And so we may guess that every
 article of Maimonides which seems to offer difficulties to us contains an
 assertion of some relaxed belief, or a protest against the pretensions of
 other creeds, though we are not always able to discover the exact
 necessity for them. On the other hand, Maimonides did not assert the
 belief in free will, for which he argued so earnestly in his <i>Guide</i>.
 The common "man," with his simple unspeculative mind, for whom these
 Thirteen Articles were intended, "never dreamed that the will was not
 free," and there was no necessity of impressing on his mind things which
 he had never doubted. [n. 34]
 
 </p><p>So much about Maimonides. As to the Anti-Maimonists, it could hardly
 escape the reader that in some of the quoted systems the difference from
 the view of Maimonides is only a logical one, not a theological. Of some
 authors again, especially those of the thirteenth and fourteenth
 centuries, it is not at all certain whether they intended to oppose
 Maimonides. Others again, as for instance R. Abba Mari, R. Lipman, and R.
 Joseph Jabez, acted on the same principle as Maimonides, urging only those
 teachings of Judaism which they thought endangered. One could now, indeed,
 animated by the praiseworthy exam- [p. 180] ples given to us by
 Maimonides, also propose some articles of faith which are suggested to us
 by the necessities of our own time.  One might, for instance, insert the
 article, "I believe that Judaism is, in the first instance, a divine
 religion, <i>not</i> a mere complex of racial peculiarities and tribal
 customs." One might again propose an article to the effect that Judaism is
 a proselytising religion, having the mission to bring about God's kingdom
 on earth, and to include in that kingdom all mankind. One might also
 submit for consideration whether, it would not be advisable to urge a
 little more the principle that religion means chiefly a
 <i>Weltanschauung</i> and worship of God by means of holiness both in
 thought and in action. One would even not object to accept the article
 laid down by R. Saul, that we have to look upon ourselves as sinners.
 Morbid as such a belief may be, it would, if properly impressed on our
 mind, have perhaps the wholesome effect of cooling down a little our self
 importance and our mutual admiration that makes all progress among us
 almost impossible. 
 
 </p><p>But it was not my purpose to ventilate here the question whether
 Maimonides' articles are sufficient for us, or whether we ought not to add
 new ones to them. Nor do I attempt to decide what system we ought to
 prefer for recitation in the Synagogue -- that of Maimonides or that of
 Chasdai, or of any other writer. I do not think that such a recital is of
 much use. My object in this sketch has been rather to make the reader
 think about Judaism, by proving that it regulates not only our actions,
 but also our thoughts. We usually urge that in Judaism religion means
 life; but we forget that a life without guiding principles and thoughts is
 a Life not worth living. At [p. 181] least it was so considered by the
 greatest Jewish thinkers, and hence their efforts to formulate the creed
 of Judaism, so that men should not only be able to do the right thing, but
 also to think the right thing. Whether they succeeded in their attempts
 towards formulating the creed of Judaism or not will always remain a
 question. This concerns the logician more than the theologian.  But surely
 Maimonides and his successors did succeed in having a religion depending
 directly on God, with the most ideal and lofty aspirations for the future;
 whilst the Judaism of a great part of our modern theologians reminds one
 very much of the words with which the author of <i>Marius the
 Epicurean</i> characterises the Roman religion in the days of her decline:
 a religion which had been always something to be done rather than
 something to be thought, or believed, or loved. 
 
 </p><p>Political economy, hygiene, statistics, are very fine things. But no
 sane man would for them make those sacrifices which Judaism requires from
 us. It is only for God's sake, to fulfil His commands and to accomplish
 His purpose, that religion becomes worth living and dying for. And this
 can only be possible with a religion which possesses dogmas. 
 
 </p><p>It is true that every great religion is "a concentration of many ideas
 and ideals," which make this religion able to adapt itself to various
 modes of thinking and living. But there must always be a point round which
 all these ideas concentrate themselves. This centre is Dogma.
