 <p>1. Magnified and praised be the living God: he is, and there is no limit in time unto his being.</p>  
 <p>2. He is One, and there is no unity like unto his unity; inconceivable is he, and unending is his unity.</p>  
 <p>3. He hath neither bodily form nor substance: we can compare nought unto him in his holiness.</p>  
 <p>4. He was before anything that hath been created—even the first: but his existence had no beginning.</p>  
 <p>5. Behold he is the Lord of the universe: to every creature he teacheth his greatness and his sovereignty.</p>  
 <p>6. The rich gift of his prophecy he gave unto the men of his choice, in whom he gloried.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_3"><font size="1" color="green">p. 3</font></a></p>  
 <p>7. There hath never yet arisen in Israel a prophet like unto Moses, one who hath beheld his similitude,</p>  
 <p>8. The Law of truth God gave unto his people by the hand of his prophet who was faithful in his house.</p>  
 <p>9. God will not alter nor change his Law to everlasting for any other.</p>  
 <p>10. He watcheth and knoweth our secret thoughts: he beholdeth the end of a thing before it existeth.</p>  
 <p>11. He bestoweth lovingkindness upon a man according to his work; he giveth to the wicked evil according to his wickedness.</p>  
 <p>12. He will send our anointed at the end of days, to redeem them that wait for the end—his salvation.</p>  
 <p>13. In the abundance of his lovingkindness God will quicken the dead. Blessed for evermore be his glorious name.</p>  
 <p>He is Lord of the universe, who reigned ere any creature yet was formed:</p>  
 <p>At the time when all things were made by his desire, then was his name proclaimed King.</p>  
 <p>And after all things shall have had an end, he alone, the dreaded one, shall reign;</p>  
 <p>Who was, who is, and who will be in glory.</p>  
 <p>And he is One, and there is no second to compare to him, to consort with him:</p>  
 <p>Without beginning, without end: to him belong strength and dominion.</p>  
 <p>And he is my God—my Redeemer liveth—and a rock in my travail in time of distress;</p>  
 <p>And he is my banner and my refuge, the portion of my cup on the day when I call.</p>  
 <p>Into his hand I commend my spirit, when I sleep and when I wake:</p>  
 <p>And with my spirit, my body also: the Lord is with me, and I will not fear.</p>

 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and given us command concerning the washing of the hands.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast formed man in wisdom, and created in him many orifices and vessels. It is revealed and known before the throne of thy glory, that if one of these be opened, or one of those be closed, it would be impossible to exist and to stand before thee. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who healest all flesh and doest wondrously.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast sanctified us by thy commandments, and commanded us to occupy ourselves with the words of the Law.</p>  
 <p>Make pleasant, therefore, we beseech thee, O Lord our God, the words of thy Law in our mouth and in the mouth of thy people, the house of Israel, so that we with our offspring and the offspring of thy people, the house of Israel, may all know thy name and learn thy Law. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who teachest the Law to thy people Israel.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who hast chosen us from all nations and given us thy Law. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who givest the Law.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_5"><font size="1" color="green">p. 5</font></a></p>  
 <p>The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.</p>  
 <p align="center">Mishnah. Treatise Peah, ch. i.</p>  
 <p>These are the things which have no fixed measure (by enactment of the Law): the corners of the field, the first fruits, the offerings brought on appearing before the Lord at the three festivals, the practice of charity and the study of the Law.—These are the things, the fruits of which a man enjoys in this world, while the stock remains for him for the world to come: viz., honoring father and mother, the practice of charity, timely attendance at the house of study morning and evening, hospitality to wayfarers, visiting the sick, dowering the bride, attending the dead to the grave, devotion in prayer, and making peace between man and his fellow; but the study of the Law is equal to them all.</p>  
 <p>O my God, the soul which thou gavest me is pure; thou didst create it, thou didst form it, thou didst breathe it into me; thou preservest it within me; and thou wilt take it from me, but wilt restore it unto me hereafter. So long as the soul is within me, I will give thanks unto thee, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, Sovereign of all works, Lord of all souls! Blessed art thou, O Lord, who restorest souls unto dead bodies.</p>

 <p>And may it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to make us familiar with thy Law, and to make us cleave to thy commandments,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_8"><font size="1" color="green">p. 8</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> O lead us not into the power of sin, or of transgression or iniquity, or of temptation, or of scorn: let not the evil inclination have sway over us: keep us far from a bad man and a bad companion: make us cleave to the good inclination and to good works: subdue our inclination so that it may submit itself unto thee; and let us obtain this day, and every day, grace, favor and mercy in thine eyes, and in the eyes of all who behold us; and bestow lovingkindnesses upon us. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who bestowest lovingkindnesses upon thy people Israel.</p>  
 <p>May it be thy will, O Lord my God and God of my fathers, to deliver me this day, and every day, from arrogant men and from arrogance, from a bad mar., from a bad companion and from a bad neighbor, and from any mishap, and from the adversary that destroyeth; from a hard judgment, and from a hard opponent, whether he be a son of the covenant or be not a son or the covenant.</p>  
 <p>At all times let a man fear God as well in private as in public, acknowledge the truth, and speak the truth in his heart; and let him rise early and say:</p>  
 <p>Sovereign of all worlds! Not because of our righteous acts do we lay our supplications before thee, but because of thine abundant mercies. What are we? What is our life? What is our piety? What our righteousness?</p>  
 <p><a name="page_9"><font size="1" color="green">p. 9</font></a></p>  
 <p>What our helpfulness? What our strength? What our might? What shall we say before thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers? Are not all the mighty men as nought before thee, the men of renown as though they had not been, the wise as if without knowledge, and the men of understanding as if without discernment? For most of their works are void, and the days of their lives are vanity before thee, and the pre-eminence of man over the beast is nought, for all is vanity.</p>  
 <p>Nevertheless we are thy people, the children of thy covenant, the children of Abraham, thy friend, to whom thou didst swear on Mount Moriah; the seed of Isaac, his only son, who was bound upon the altar the congregation of Jacob, thy first barn son, whose name thou didst call Israel and Jeshurun by reason of the love wherewith thou didst love him, and the joy wherewith thou didst rejoice in him.</p>  
 <p>It is, therefore, our duty to thank, praise and glorify thee, to bless, to sanctify and to offer praise and thanksgiving unto thy name. Happy are we! how goodly is our portion, and how pleasant is our lot, and how beautiful our heritage! Happy are we who, early and late, morning and evening, twice every day, declare:</p>  
 <p>Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One. Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is forever and ever.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_10"><font size="1" color="green">p. 10</font></a></p>  
 <p>Thou wast the same ere the world was created; thou hast been the same since the world hath been created; thou art the same in this world, and thou wilt be the same in the world to come. Sanctify thy name upon them that sanctify it, yea, sanctify thy name throughout thy world; and through thy salvation let our horn be exalted and raised on high. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who sanctifiest thy name amongst the many,</p>  
 <p>Thou art the Lord our God in heaven and on earth, and in the highest heaven of heavens. Verily thou art the first and thou art the last, and beside thee there is no God. O gather them that hope for thee from the four corners of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that thou art God, thou alone, over all the kingdoms of the earth. Thou hast made the heavens and the earth, the sea and all that is therein; and which among all the works of thy hands, whether among those above or among those beneath, can say unto thee, What doest thou? Our Father who art in heaven, deal kindly with us for the sake of thy great name by which we are called; and fulfil unto us, O Lord our God, that which is written, At that time will I bring you in, and at that time will I gather you; for I will make you</p>

 <p>a name and a praise among all the peoples of the earth, when I bring back your captivity before your eyes, saith the Lord.</p>  
 <p align="center">Numbers xxviii. 1–8.</p>  
 <p>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My oblation, my food for my offerings made by fire, of a sweet savor unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in its due season. And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by fire which ye shall offer unto the Lord; he-lambs of the first year without blemish, two day by day, for a continual burnt offering. The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other lamb shalt thou offer at even; and the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil. It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount Sinai f or a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou pour out a drink offering of strong drink unto the Lord. And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meal offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof, thou shalt offer it, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savor unto the Lord.</p>

 <p>And on the sabbath day two he-lambs of the first year without blemish, and two tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof: this is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>On New Moon the following is added:—</i></p>  
 <p align="center">Numbers xxviii. 11–15.</p>  
 <p>And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the Lord; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven he-lambs of the first year without blemish; and three tenth parts of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for each bullock; and two tenth parts of fine flour for a meal offering, mingled with oil, for the one ram; and a several tenth part of fine flour mingled with oil for a meal offering unto every lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet savor, an offering made by fire unto the Lord. And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine for a bullock, and the third part of an hin for the ram, and the fourth part of an hin for a lamb: this is the burnt offering of every month throughout the months of the year. And one the-goat for a sin offering unto the Lord; it shall be offered beside the continual burnt offering, and the drink offering thereof.</p>

 <p align="center">Mishnah, Treatise Zebachim, ch. v.</p>  
 <p>1. Which are the places where the sacrifices were offered?—Those that were most holy were slain on the north side of the altar: the bull and the he-goat of the Day of Atonement were slain on the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side, and had to be sprinkled between the staves of the ark, and towards the veil, and upon the golden altar: one of these sprinklings omitted rendered the whole ceremony invalid. The remaining blood the priest poured out at the western base of the outer altar; if, however, he did not do so, the omission did not render the ceremony invalid.</p>  
 <p>2. The bulls and he-goats which were to be wholly burnt. were slain on the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side, and had to be sprinkled towards the veil and upon the golden altar: one of these sprinklings omitted rendered the whole ceremony invalid. The remaining blood the priest poured out at the western base of the outer altar; if, however, he failed to do so, it did not render the ceremony invalid: both these and the preceding offerings were burnt in the repository of ashes.</p>  
 <p>3. The sin offerings of the congregation and of the individual.—These are the sin offerings of the congregation: the he-goats offered on the new moon and on the festivals. They were slain on the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side, and of this blood four sprinklings had to be made, one upon each of the four corners of the altar. How was this done? The priest went up the ascent, passed on to the middle terrace that surrounded the altar, and came successively to the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_14"><font size="1" color="green">p. 14</font></a></p>  
 <p>south-east, the north-east, the north-west and the south-west corners. The remaining blood he poured out at the southern base of the altar. These sacrifices might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by the males of the priesthood, within the hangings of the court, the same day and evening until midnight.</p>  
 <p>4. The burnt offering belonged to the class of the most holy. It was slain on the north side; its blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side; and of its blood two sprinklings had to be made (at opposite angles of the altar) so as to constitute four, (a portion of the blood thus reaching each of the four sides of the altar). This offering had also to be flayed, dismembered and totally consumed by fire.</p>  
 <p>5. The peace offerings of the congregation and the trespass offerings.—These are the trespass offerings: the trespass offerings for robbery, for profane appropriation of sanctified objects, for carnally knowing a handmaid already promised in marriage; the trespass offering of a Nazirite who has become defiled by a dead body; the trespass offering of a leper at his cleansing; the trespass offering of one who is in doubt whether he has committed an act that has to be atoned for by a sin offering. All these were slain on the north side; their blood was received in a vessel of ministry on the north side; and of their blood two sprinklings had to be made at the altar in such a manner as to constitute four. These sacrifices might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by the males of the priesthood, within the hangings of the court, the same day and evening until midnight.</p>  
 <p>6. The thank offering and the ram of the Nazirite were holy in a minor degree. They might be slain in any part of the court, of their blood two sprinklings</p>  
 <p><a name="page_15"><font size="1" color="green">p. 15</font></a></p>  
 <p>had to be made at the altar in such a manner as to constitute four; and they might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by any person, in any part of the city, the same day and until midnight. To the portions thereof belonging to the priests the same rule 'applied as to the rest, except that the former might only be eaten by the priests, their wives, their children and their slaves.</p>  
 <p>7. The peace offerings were also holy in a minor degree. They might be slain in any part of the court; of their blood two sprinklings had to be made at the altar in such a manner as to constitute four, and they might be eaten, dressed after any manner, by any person, in any part of the city, during two days and one night. To the portions thereof belonging to the priests the same rule applied as to the rest, except that the former might only be eaten by the priests, their wives, their children and their slaves.</p>  
 <p>8. The first-born, the tithe of cattle and the paschal lamb were likewise holy in a minor degree. They might be slain in any part of the court; only one sprinkling of their blood had to be made; this, however, had to be done towards the base of the altar. In respect to their consumption the following differences prevailed: the first-born might be eaten only by the priests, while the tithe might be eaten by any person: both might be eaten, dressed after any manner, in any part of the city, during two days and one night. The paschal lamb might only be eaten the same evening until midnight; it might be partaken of by none but the previously appointed number of persons, and it might only be eaten roasted.</p>  
 <p align="center">Boraitha d’R. Ishmael.</p>  
 <p><small>Rabbi Ishmael says: There are thirteen exegetical principles</small></p>  
 <p><a name="page_16"><font size="1" color="green">p. 16</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>by which the Law is expounded:—1. The inference from minor to major. 2. The inference from a similarity of phrases. 3. A general law may be derived by induction from different cases which, occurring in the same or in different verses, have yet some feature in common. 4. A general proposition followed by the enumeration of particulars already comprehended in the general proposition, (in which case the scope of the proposition is limited by the things specified) 5. An enumeration of particulars followed by a general proposition in which they are also comprehended, (in which case the scope of the proposition extends also to the things not specified). 6. Two general propositions, separated from each other by an enumeration of particulars, include only such things as are similar to those specified 7. An inference drawn from a general proposition complemented by a particular term, and an inference drawn from a particular term complemented by a general proposition. 8. If anything is included in a general proposition and is then made the subject of a special statement, that which is predicated of it is not to be understood as limited to itself alone, but is to be applied to the whole of the general proposition 9. If anything is included in a general proposition, and is then singled out in order to be made the subject of a special statement, similar to the general proposition, this particularisation is intended, so far as its subject is concerned, to lessen and not to add to its restrictions. 10. If anything is included in a general proposition, and is then singled out in order to be made the subject of a special statement, not similar to the general proposition, this particularisation is intended in some respects to lessen and in others to add to its restrictions. 11. If anything is included in a general proposition, and is then made the subject of a fresh statement (not in harmony with the former), the terms of the general proposition will not apply to it, unless the Scripture distinctly indicates that they shall apply. 12. The meaning of a passage may be deduced from its context, or from some subsequent passage. 13. Similarly, when two passages are in contradiction to each other, the explanation can be determined only when a third text is found, capable of harmonizing the two.</small></p>

 <p>I am here enwrapping myself in this fringed robe, in fulfilment of the command of my Creator, as it is written in the Law, They shall make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments throughout their generations. And even as I cover myself with the Tallith in this world, so may my soul deserve to be clothed with a beauteous spiritual robe in the world to come, in the garden of Eden. Amen.</p>

They sate themselves with the fatness of thy house; and thou givest them to drink of the river of thy pleasures. For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light do we see light.

 <p align="center"><i>Meditation before laying the Tephillin</i>.</p>  
 <p>I am here intent upon the act of laying the Tephillin, in fulfilment of the command of my Creator, who hath commanded us to lay the Tephillin, as it is written in the Law, And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. Within these Tephillin are placed four sections of the Law, <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">*</font></a> that declare the absolute</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_18"><font size="1" color="green">p. 18</font></a></p>  
 <p>unity of God, and that remind us of the miracles and wonders which he wrought for us when he brought us forth from Egypt, even he who hath power over the highest and the lowest to deal with them according to his will. He hath commanded us to lay the Tephillin upon the hand as a memorial of his outstretched arm; opposite the heart, to indicate the duty of subjecting the longings and designs of our heart to his service, blessed be he; and upon the head over against the brain, thereby teaching that the mind, whose seat is in the brain, together with all senses and faculties, is to be subjected to his service, blessed be he. May the effect of the precept thus observed be to extend to me long life with sacred influences and holy thoughts, free from every approach, even in imagination, to sin and iniquity. May the evil inclination not mislead or entice us, but may we be led to serve the Lord as it is in our hearts to do. Amen.</p>

Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that seek the Lord. Search ye for the Lord and his strength; seek ye his face evermore. Remember his marvellous works that he hath done: his wonders, and the judgments of his mouth; O ye seed of Israel, his servant, ye children of Jacob, his chosen ones. He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth. Remember his covenant for ever, the word which he commanded to a thousand generations; (the covenant) which he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac; and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, to Israel for an everlasting covenant: saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, as the lot of your inheritance: when ye were but a few men in number; yea, few, and sojourners in it; and they went about from nation to nation, and from one kingdom to another people. He suffered no man to oppress them; yea, he rebuked kings for their sakes; (saying), Touch not mine</p>

Grandeur and majesty are before him: strength and gladness are in his place. Give unto the Lord, ye families of the peoples, give unto the Lord glory and strength. Give unto the Lord the glory due unto his name: take an offering, and come before him: worship the Lord in the beauty of holiness. Tremble before him all the earth; the world also is set firm, that it cannot be moved. Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; and let them say among the nations, The Lord reigneth. Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; let the plain exult, and all that is therein. Then shall the trees of the forest exult before the Lord, for he cometh to judge the earth. O give thanks unto the Lord; for he is good: for his lovingkindness endureth forever. And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us and deliver us from the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, from everlasting even to everlasting. And all the people said, Amen, and praised the Lord.</p>  
 <p>Exalt ye the Lord our God, and worship at his footstool;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_22"><font size="1" color="green">p. 22</font></a></p>  
 <p>holy is he. Exalt ye the Lord our God, aim worship at his holy mount; for the Lord our God is holy. And he, being merciful, forgiveth iniquity, and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up all his wrath. Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. Ascribe ye strength unto God: his majesty is over Israel, and his strength is in the skies. O God, thou art to be feared out of thy holy places: the God of Israel he giveth strength and power unto his people. Blessed be God. O God of vengeance, Lord, O God of vengeance, shine forth. Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render to the proud their desert. Salvation belongeth unto the Lord: thy blessing be upon thy people. (Selah.) The Lord of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our stronghold. (Selah. ) O Lord of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee. Save, .Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them, and carry them for ever Our soul waiteth for the Lord: he is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. Let thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped for thee. Show us thy lovingkindness, O Lord, and grant us thy salvation. Rise up for our help and set</p>  
 <p><a name="page_23"><font size="1" color="green">p. 23</font></a></p>  
 <p>us free for thy lovingkindness’ sake. I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee up out of the land of Egypt: open wide thy mouth and I will fill it. Happy is the people, that is in such a case: happy is the people, whose God is the Lord. And as for me, I have trusted in thy lovingkindness; my heart shall be glad in thy salvation: I will sing unto the Lord, because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p>

 <p align="center">Psalm xix.</p>  
 <p>For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. The heavens recount the glory of God, and the firmament declareth his handiwork. Day unto day poureth forth speech, and night unto night proclaimeth knowledge.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_24"><font size="1" color="green">p. 24</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> There is no speech nor language; their voice cannot be heard. Their sound is gone out through all the earth, and their words to the end of the world; in them hath he set a tent for the sun. And he is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and rejoiceth as a strong man to run his course. His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from his heat.—The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul: the testimony of the Lord is faithful, making wise the simple. The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring for ever; the judgments of the Lord are truthful, righteous altogether. More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine gold; sweeter also than honey and the droppings of the honeycomb. Moreover by them is thy servant warned: in keeping them there is great reward. Who can discern his errors? Clear thou me from hidden faults. Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me: then shall I be blameless, and I shall be clear from great transgression. Let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm xxxiv.</p>  
 <p align="center"><small>A Psalm of David; when he changed his behavior before Abimelech, who drove him away, and he departed.</small></p>

 <p>My soul shall make her boast in the Lord: the meek shall hear and rejoice.</p>  
 <p>O magnify the Lord with me, and let us exalt his name together.</p>  
 <p>I sought the Lord, and he answered me, and delivered me from all my fears.</p>  
 <p>They looked unto him. and shone with joy: and their faces shall not be confounded.</p>  
 <p>This sufferer cried, and the Lord heard him, and saved him out of all his troubles.</p>  
 <p>The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them that fear him, and delivereth them.</p>  
 <p>O taste and see that the Lord is good: happy is the man that taketh refuge in him.</p>  
 <p>O fear the Lord, ye his holy ones: for there is no want to them that fear him.</p>  
 <p>Young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek the Lord shall not want any good.</p>  
 <p>Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear of the Lord.</p>  
 <p>What man is he that delighteth in life, and loveth many days that he may see good?</p>  
 <p>Keep thy tongue from evil and thy lips from speaking guile.</p>  
 <p>Depart from evil and do good; seek peace and pursue it.</p>  
 <p>The eyes of the Lord are towards the righteous, and his ears are towards their cry.</p>  
 <p>The face of the Lord is against them that do evil, to cut off the remembrance of them from the earth.</p>  
 <p>(The righteous) cry, and the Lord hearkeneth, and delivereth them out of all their troubles.</p>  
 <p>The Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart, and saveth such as are of a contrite spirit.</p>

 <p>Many are the evil fortunes of the righteous: but the Lord delivereth him out of them all.</p>

 <p>Evil shall slay the wicked; and they that hate the righteous shall be condemned.</p>

 <p align="center">Psalm xc.</p>  
 <p>A Prayer of Moses, the man of God. O Lord, thou hast been a dwelling place unto us in all generations. Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou gavest birth to the earth and the world, even from everlasting to everlasting thou art God. Thou turnest man back to dust, and sayest, Return, ye children of men. For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it is past, and as a watch in the night. Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are in a sleep: in the morning they are like grass which sprouteth afresh. In the morning it bloometh and sprouteth afresh; in the evening it is cut down, and withereth. For we are consumed by thine anger, and in thy wrath are we confounded. Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in the light of thy countenance. For all our days have passed away in thy wrath, we bring our years to an end like a sound. The days of our years are threescore years and ten, or even by reason of strength fourscore years; yet is their pride but travail and nothingness; for it is soon gone by, and we fly away. Who knoweth the power of thine anger, and thy wrath according to the fear that is due unto thee? So teach us to number our days, that we may get us a heart of wisdom. Return, O Lord; how long?—and repent thee concerning thy</p>  
 <p><a name="page_27"><font size="1" color="green">p. 27</font></a></p>  
 <p>servants. O satisfy us in the morning with thy lovingkindness; that we may exult and rejoice all our days. Make us rejoice according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted us, the years wherein we have seen evil. Let thy work be made manifest unto thy servants, and thy majesty upon their children.</p>  
 <p>And let the pleasantness of the Lord our God be upon us; and establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of our hands establish thou it.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm xci.</p>  
 <p>He that dwelleth in the shelter of the Most High abideth under the shadow of the Almighty. I say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress; my God, in whom I trust.—For he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and from the noisome pestilence. He shall cover thee with his pinions, and under his wings shalt thou take refuge: his truth shall be a shield and a buckler. Thou shalt not be afraid of the terror by night, nor of the arrow that flieth by day; of the pestilence that walketh in darkness, nor of the plague that ravageth at noon day. A thousand may fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy right hand; it shall not come nigh unto thee. Only .with thine eyes shalt thou look on, and see the retribution of the wicked.—For thou, O Lord, art my refuge.—Thou hast made the Most High thy dwelling place; there shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any scourge come nigh thy tent. For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in all thy . ways. They shall bear thee upon their hands, lest thou strike thy foot against a stone. Thou shalt tread upon the lion and the adder; upon the young lion and the serpent shalt thou trample.—Because he hath set his love upon me,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="green">p. 28</font></a></p>  
 <p>therefore will I deliver him: I will set him on high, because he knoweth my name. When he calleth upon me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble: I will deliver him and honor him. With length of days will I satisfy him, and will let him see my salvation.</p>

 <p align="center">Psalm cxxxv.</p>  
 <p>Praise ye the Lord. Praise ye the name of the Lord; praise him, O ye servants of the Lord: ye that stand in the house of the Lord, in the courts of the house of our God. Praise ye the Lord; for the Lord is good: sing praises unto his name; for it is pleasant. For the Lord hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure. For I know that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all gods. Whatsoever the Lord pleaseth, that doeth he, in heaven and in earth, in the seas and in all deeps. He causeth vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth forth the wind out of his treasuries. It is he who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast. He sent signs and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants. It is he who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings; Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the kingdoms of Canaan: and gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel his people. Thy name, O Lord, endureth for ever; thy memorial, O Lord, throughout all generations. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself concerning his servants,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="green">p. 29</font></a></p>  
 <p>The idols of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's hands. They have mouths, but they speak. not; eyes have they, but they see not; they have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath in their mouths. They that make them shall become like unto them; yea, every one that trusteth in them. O house of Israel, bless ye the Lord: O house of Aaron, bless ye the Lord: O house of Levi, bless ye the Lord: ye that fear the Lord, bless ye the Lord. Blessed be the Lord out of Zion, who dwelleth at Jerusalem. Praise ye the Lord.</p>

 <p align="center">Psalm xxxiii.</p>  
 <p>Exult in the Lord, O ye righteous: praise is seemly for the upright. Give thanks unto the Lord with the lyre; sing praises unto him with the harp of ten strings. Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with shouts of joy. For the word of the Lord is right; and all his work is done in faithfulness. He loveth righteousness</p>  
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="green">p. 31</font></a></p>  
 <p>and justice: the earth is full of the lovingkindness of the Lord. By the word of the Lord the heavens were made; and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the sea together as a heap: he layeth up the floods in store-houses. Let all the earth fear the Lord: let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. For he spake, and it was; he commanded, and it stood fast. The Lord hath frustrated the design of the nations; he hath foiled the thoughts of the peoples. The counsel of the Lord standeth fast for ever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. Happy is the nation whose god is the Lord; the people whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance. The Lord looketh down from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of men; from the place of his habitation he gazeth upon all the inhabitants of the earth; he that fashioneth the hearts of them all, that giveth heed to all their works. A king is not saved by greatness of power: a mighty man is not delivered by greatness of strength. A horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he rescue any by his great power. Behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him, upon them that hope for his lovingkindness to deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in famine. Our soul waiteth for the Lord: he is our help and our shield. For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in his holy name. Let thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have hoped for thee.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm xcii.</p>  
 <p>A Psalm, a Song for the Sabbath Day. It is a good thing to give thanks unto the Lord, and to sing praises unto thy name, O Most High: to declare thy lovingkindness</p>  
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="green">p. 32</font></a></p>  
 <p>in the morning, and thy faithfulness every night, with an instrument of ten strings and with a harp, with thoughtful music upon the lyre. For thou, O Lord, hast made me rejoice through thy work: I will exult in the work of thy hands. How great are thy works, O Lord: thy thoughts are very deep. A brutish man knoweth it not, neither doth a fool understand this: when the wicked sprang up as the grass, and all the workers of iniquity flourished, it was that they might be destroyed for ever. But thou, O Lord, art on high for evermore. For, lo, thine enemies, O Lord, for, lo, thine enemies shall perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered. But my horn hast thou exalted, like that of the wild-ox: I am anointed with fresh oil. Mine eye also hath seen my desire on mine enemies; mine ears have heard my desire of them that rose up against me, doers of evil. The righteous shall spring up like a palm-tree; he shall grow tall like a cedar in Lebanon. Planted in the house of the Lord, they shall blossom in the courts of our God. They shall still shoot forth in old age; they shall be full of sap and green: to declare that the Lord is upright: he is my rock, and there is no unrighteousness in him.</p>  
 <p align="center">Psalm xciii.</p>  
 <p>The Lord reigneth; he hath robed him in majesty; the Lord hath robed him, yea, he hath girded himself with strength: the world also is set firm, that it cannot be moved. Thy throne is set firm from of old: thou art from everlasting. The streams have lifted up, O Lord, the streams have lifted tip their voice; the streams lift up their roaring. Than the voices of many waters, mighty waters, breakers of the sea, more mighty is the Lord on high.</p>

High praises of God are in their throat, and a two-edged sword in their hand; to execute vengeance upon the nations, and punishments upon the peoples: to bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the judgment written: this is an honor for all his loving ones. Praise ye the Lord.</p>

 <p>Praise ye the Lord. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his power. Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his abundant greatness. Praise him with the blast of the horn: praise him with the harp and the lyre. Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with stringed instruments and the pipe. Praise him with the clear-toned cymbals; praise him with the loud-sounding cymbals. Let everything that hath breath praise the Lord: praise ye the Lord.</p>

 <p>And David blessed the Lord in the presence of all the congregation: and David said, Blessed art thou, O Lord, the God of Israel our father, from everlasting to everlasting. Thine, O Lord, is the greatness, and the power, and the glory, and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the heaven and in the earth is thine; thine, O Lord, is the kingdom, and the supremacy as head over all.

 <p align="center">Nehemiah ix. 6–11.</p>  
 <p>Thou art the Lord, even thou alone; thou hast made the heavens, the heaven of heavens, and all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou givest life to them all; and the host of heaven worship thee. Thou art the Lord the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham: and foundest his heart faithful before thee:</p>  
 <p>And thou madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, even to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous. And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea; and shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt arrogantly against them; and didst make thee a name, as it is this day.</p>

 <p align="center">Exod. xiv. 30–xv. 18.</p>  
 <p>Thus the Lord saved Israel that day out of the hand of the Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea shore. And Israel saw the great power which the Lord put forth against the Egyptians, and the people feared the Lord: and they believed in the Lord, and in Moses his servant.</p>  
 <p>Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord, and spake, saying: I will sing unto the Lord, for he hath been highly exalted: the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. The Lord is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: this is my God, and I will glorify him; my father's God, and I will exalt him. The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name. Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: and his chosen captains are sunk in the Red Sea. The floods cover them: they went down into the depths like a stone. Thy right hand, O Lord, that is glorious in power, thy right hand, O Lord, dasheth in pieces the enemy. And in the greatness of thy majesty thou overthrowest them that rise up against thee: thou sendest forth thy wrath, it consumeth them as stubble. And with the</p>

The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil: my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty waters. Who is like unto thee, O Lord, amongst the mighty ones: who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, revered in praises, doing marvels? Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. Thou in thy lovingkindness hast led the people which thou hast redeemed: thou has guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation. The peoples have heard it; they tremble: pangs have taken hold of the inhabitants of Philistia. Then were the dukes of Edom confounded; the mighty men of Moab, trembling taketh hold of them: all the inhabitants of Canaan are melted away. Terror and dread falleth upon them: by the greatness of thine arm they are as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O Lord, till the people pass over, which thou hast acquired. Thou wilt bring them in, and plan them in the mountain of thine inheritance, the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.

 <p>not thou thy tender mercies from us, O Lord: let thy lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve us. Save us, O Lord our God, and gather us from amongst the nations, to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy praise. If thou shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord, who could stand? But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be feared. Not according to our sins wilt thou deal with us, nor requite us according to our iniquities. If our iniquities testify against us, work thou, O Lord, for thy name's sake. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. May the Lord answer us in the day of trouble, the name of the God of Jacob set us up on high. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Our Father, our King, be gracious unto us and answer us, for we have no good works of our own; deal with us in charity for thy name's sake. Our Lord, our God, hearken to the voice of our supplications, and remember unto us the covenant of our fathers, and save us for thy name's sake. And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast made thee a name as at this day; we have sinned, we have done wickedly. O Lord, according to all thy righteous acts, let thine anger and thy fury, I pray thee, be turned away from thy city Jerusalem, thy holy mountain; because for our sins and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are become a reproach to all that are round about us. Now therefore, hearken, O our God, unto the prayer</p>

 <p>Incline thine ear, O my God, and hear; open thine eyes, and behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy name: for we do not lay our supplications before thee because of our righteous acts, but because of thine abundant mercies. O Lord, hear; O Lord forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer not; for thine own sake, O my God, because thy city and thy people are called by thy name. O our Father, merciful Father, show us a sign for good, and gather our scattered ones from the four corners of the earth. Let all the nations perceive and know that thou art the Lord our God. And now, O Lord, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and thou art our potter, yea, we are all the work of thy hand. Save us for thy name's sake, our Rock, our King, and our Redeemer. Spare thy people, O Lord, and give not thine inheritance over to reproach, that the nations should make a by-word of them. Wherefore should they say among the peoples, Where is their God? We know that we have sinned, and there is none to stand up in our behalf; let thy great name stand for our defence in time of trouble. We know that we have no good works of our own; deal with us in charity for thy name's sake. As a father hath mercy upon his children, so, O Lord, have mercy upon us, and save us for thy name's sake.

O Lord our God, spare and be merciful; save the sheep of thy pasture; let not wrath rule over us, for our eyes are bent upon thee; save us for thy name's sake. Have mercy upon us for the sake of thy covenant; look, and answer us in time of trouble, for salvation is thine, O Lord. Our hope is in thee, O God of forgiveness. We beseech thee, forgive, O good and forgiving God, for thou art a gracious and merciful God and King.</p>  
 <p>We beseech thee, O gracious and merciful King, remember and give heed to the Covenant between the Pieces (with Abraham), and let the binding (upon the altar) of (Isaac) an only son appear before thee, to the welfare of Israel.

 <p>There is none gracious and merciful like thee, O Lord our God; there is none like thee, O God, slow to anger and abounding in lovingkindness and truth. Save us in thine abundant mercies; from fierceness and rage deliver us. Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob; look not unto our stubbornness and our wickedness and our sin. Turn from thy fierce anger, and repent of the evil against thy people. Remove from us the stroke of death, for thou art merciful, for such is thy way—showing lovingkindness freely throughout all generations. Spare thy people, O Lord, and deliver us from thy wrath, and remove from us the stroke of the plague, and harsh decrees, for thou art the Guardian of Israel. Unto thee, O Lord, belongeth righteousness, but unto us confusion of face. How may we complain? What can we say, what can we speak, or how can we justify ourselves? We will search our ways and try them, and turn again to thee; for thy right hand is stretched out to receive the penitent. Save, we beseech thee, O Lord; we beseech thee, O Lord, send prosperity. We beseech thee, O Lord, answer us on the day when we call. For thee, O Lord, we wait; for thee, O Lord, we hope; in thee, O Lord, we trust; be not silent, nor let us be oppressed; for the nations say, Their hope is lost. Let every knee and all that is lofty bow down to thee alone.</p>

 <p>ever; arise and save us, for we trust in thee. Our Father, our King, though we be without righteousness and good deeds, remember unto us the covenant of our fathers, and the testimony we bear every day that the Lord is One. Look upon our affliction, for many are our griefs and the sorrows of our heart. Have pity upon us, O Lord, in the land of our captivity, and pour not out thy wrath upon us, for we are thy people, the children of thy covenant. O God, look upon our sunken glory among the nations, and the abomination in which we are held as of utter defilement. How long shall thy strength remain in captivity, and thy glory in the hand of the foe? Arouse thy might and thy zeal against thine enemies, that they may be put to shame and broken down in their might. O let not our travail seem little in thy sight. Let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us in the day of our trouble; and if not for our sake, do it for thine own sake, and destroy not the remembrance of our remnant; but be gracious unto a people, who in constant love proclaim the unity of thy name twice every day, saying, Hear, O Israel: the Lord our God, the Lord is One.</p>  
 <p>And David said unto Gad, I am troubled exceedingly; let us fall, I pray thee, into the hand of the Lord, for his mercies are many; but let me not fall into the hand of man.</p>

 <p>O Lord, rebuke me not in thine anger: neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure. Be gracious unto me, O Lord; for I am withered away: O Lord, heal me; for my bones are troubled. My soul also is sore troubled: and thou, O Lord, how long? Return, O Lord, deliver my soul: save me for thy lovingkindness’ sake. For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks? I am weary with my groaning; every night I make my bed to swim; I melt away my couch with my tears. Mine eye wasteth away because of grief it waxeth old because of all mine adversaries. Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the Lord hath heard the voice of my weeping. The Lord hath heard my supplication; the Lord will receive my prayer. All mine enemies shall be ashamed and sore troubled: they shall turn back, they shall be ashamed suddenly.</p>

 <p>Our Father, our King, be gracious unto us, and answer us, for we have no good works of our own; deal with us in charity and lovingkindness, and save us.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_80"><font size="1" color="green">p. 80</font></a></p>  
 <p>As for us, we know not what to do; but our eyes are upon thee. Remember, O Lord, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses; for they have been ever of old. Let thy lovingkindness, O Lord, be upon us, according as we have waited for thee. Remember not against us the iniquities of our ancestors: let thy tender mercies speedily come to meet us; for we are brought very low. Be gracious unto us, O Lord, be gracious unto us; for we are sated to the full with contempt. In wrath remember to be merciful. For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust. Help us, O God of our salvation, for the sake of the glory of thy name; and deliver us, and pardon our sins, for thy name's sake.</p>

 <p>May the Father of mercy have mercy upon a people that have been borne by him.

The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart: the commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes. The Lord will give strength unto his people: the Lord will bless his people with peace. As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the Lord is tried: he is a shield unto all them that trust in him.</p>

 <p>For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David.

We will exult in thy salvation, and in the name of our God we will set up our banners: the Lord fulfil all thy petitions. Now know I that the Lord saveth his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the mighty saving acts of his right hand. Some trust in chariots and some in horses: but we will make mention of the name of the Lord our God. They are bowed down and fallen: but we are risen and stand upright.

 <p>But thou art holy, O thou that dwellest amid the praises of Israel.

 <p>and destroyeth not: yea, many a time he turneth his anger away, and doth not stir up all his wrath. For thou, O Lord, art good and forgiving, and abounding in lovingkindness to all them that call upon thee. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy Law is truth. Thou wilt show truth to Jacob and lovingkindness to Abraham, according as thou has sworn unto our fathers from the days of old.

O Lord of hosts, happy is the man that trusteth in thee. Save, Lord: may the King answer us on the day when we call. Messed is our God, who hath created us for his glory, and hath separated us from them that go astray, and hath given us the Law of truth and planted everlasting life in our midst. May he open our heart unto his Law, and place his love and fear within our hearts, that we may do his will and serve him with a perfect heart, that we may not labor in vain, nor bring forth for confusion. May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that we may keep thy statutes in this world, and be worthy to live to witness and inherit happiness and blessing in the days of the Messiah and in the life of the world to come. To the end that my glory may sing praise unto thee, and not be silent: O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever. Blessed is the man that trusteth in the Lord, and whose trust the Lord is.

 <p>It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else an truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_94"><font size="1" color="green">p. 94</font></a></p>  
 <p>We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law, the Lord shall reign for ever and ever. And it is said, And the Lord shall be king over all the earth: in that day shall the Lord be One, and his name One.</p>
