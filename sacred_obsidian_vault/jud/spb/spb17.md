 <p align="center"><i>Begin page <a href="spb04.htm#page_2">2</a> to "the Lord is One," <a href="spb05.htm#page_43">p. 43</a>. Then continue as follows:—</i></p>  
 <p>The breath of every living being shall bless thy name, O Lord our God, and the spirit of all flesh shall continually glorify and exalt thy memorial, O our King; from everlasting to everlasting thou art God; and beside thee we have no King who redeemeth and saveth, setteth free and delivereth, who supporteth and hath mercy in all times of trouble and distress; yea, we have no King but thee.</p>  
 <p>He is God of the first and of the last, the God of all creatures, the Lord of all generations, who is extolled with many praises, and guideth his world with lovingkindness and his creatures with tender mercies. The Lord slumbereth not, nor sleepeth; he arouseth the sleepers and awakeneth the slumberers; he maketh the dumb to speak, loseth the bound, supporteth .the falling, and raiseth up the bowed.</p>  
 <p>To thee alone we give thanks. Though our mouths were full of song as the sea, and our tongues of exultation as the multitude of its waves, and our lips of praise as the wide-extended firmament; though our eyes shone with light like the sun and the moon, and our hands were spread forth like the eagles of heaven, and our feet were swift as hinds, we should still be unable to thank thee and to bless thy name, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, for one thousandth or one ten thousandth</p>  
 <p><a name="page_183"><font size="1" color="green">p. 183</font></a></p>  
 <p>part of the bounties which thou hast bestowed upon our fathers and upon us. Thou didst redeem us from Egypt, O Lord our God, and didst release us from the house of bondage; during famine thou didst feed us, and didst sustain us in plenty; from the sword thou didst rescue us, from pestilence thou didst save us, and from sore and lasting diseases thou didst deliver us. Hitherto thy tender mercies have helped us, and thy lovingkindnesses have not left us: forsake us not, O Lord our God, for ever. Therefore the limbs which thou hast spread forth upon us, and the spirit and breath which thou hast breathed into our nostrils, and the tongue which thou hast set in our mouths, lo, they shall thank, bless, praise, glorify, extol, reverence, hallow and assign kingship to thy name, O Our King. For every mouth shall give thanks unto thee, and every tongue shall swear unto thee; every knee shall bow to thee, and whatsoever is lofty shall prostrate itself before thee; all hearts shall fear thee, and all the inward parts and reins shall sing unto thy name, according to the word that is written, All my bones shall say, Lord, who is like unto thee? Thou deliverest the poor from him that is stronger than he, the poor and the needy from him that robbeth him. Who is like unto thee, who is equal to thee, who can be compared unto thee, O God, great, mighty, and awful, most high God, Possessor of heaven and earth? We will praise,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_184"><font size="1" color="green">p. 184</font></a></p>  
 <p>laud and glorify thee, and we will bless thy holy name, as it is said, (A Psalm of David,) Bless the Lord, O my soul; and all that is within me, bless his holy name. Thou art God in thy power and might, great in thy glorious name, mighty for ever and awful by thy awful acts, the King who sitteth upon a high and lofty throne.</p>  
 <p>He who inhabiteth eternity, exalted and holy is his name; and it is written, Exult in the Lord, O ye righteous; praise is seemly for the upright.</p>  
 <p>By the mouth of the upright thou shalt be praised, by the words of the righteous thou shalt be blessed, by the tongue of the loving ones thou shalt be extolled, and in the midst of the holy thou shalt be hallowed.</p>  
 <p>In the assemblies also of the tens of thousands of thy people, the house of Israel, thy name, O our King, shall be glorified with joyous dies in every generation; for such is the duty of all creatures in thy presence, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, to thank, praise, laud, glorify, extol, honor, bless, exalt and adore thee, even beyond all the words of song and praise of David the son of Jesse, thy servant and anointed.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_185"><font size="1" color="green">p. 185</font></a></p>  
 <p>Praised be thy name for ever, O our King, the great and holy God and King, in heaven and on earth; for unto thee, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, song and praise are becoming, hymn and psalm, strength and dominion, victory, greatness and might, renown and glory, holiness and sovereignty, blessings and thanksgivings from henceforth even for ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, God and King, great in praises, God of thanksgivings, Lord of wonders, who makest choice of song and psalm, O King and God, the life of all worlds.</p>

All shall extol thee for ever, thou Creator of all things, O God who openest every day the doors of the gates of the East, and cleavest the windows of the firmament, bringing forth the sun from his place, and the moon from her dwelling,</p>

 <p>giving light to the whole world and to its inhabitants whom thou createst by thy attribute of mercy. In mercy thou givest light to the earth and to there that dwell thereon, and in thy goodness renewest the creation every day continually; O King, who alone wast exalted from aforetime, praised, glorified and extolled from days of old. O everlasting God, in thine abundant mercies, have mercy upon us, Lord of our strength, Rock of our stronghold, Shield of our salvation, thou Stronghold of ours! There is none to be compared unto thee, neither is there any beside thee; there is none but thee: who is like unto thee? There is none to be compared unto thee, O Lord our God, in this world, neither is there any beside thee, O our King, for the life of the world to come; there is none but thee, O our Redeemer, for the days of the Messiah; neither is there any like unto thee. O our Saviour, for the resurrection of the dead.</p>  
 <p>God, the Lord over all works, blessed is he, and ever to be blessed by the mouth of everything that hath breath. His greatness and goodness fill the universe; knowledge and understanding surround him: he is exalted above the holy Chayoth and is adorned in glory above the celestial chariot <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_17"><font size="1">*</font></a>: purity and rectitude are before his throne,</p>

 <p>lovingkindness and tender mercy before his glory. The luminaries are good which our God hath created: he formed them with knowledge, understanding and discernment; he gave them might and power to rule in the midst of the world. They are full of lustre, and they radiate brightness: beautiful is their lustre throughout all the world. They rejoice in their going forth, and are glad in their returning; they perform with awe the will of their Master. Glory and honor they render unto his name, exultation and rejoicing at the remembrance of his sovereignty. He called unto the sun, and it shone forth in light: he looked, and ordained the figure of the moon. All the hosts on high render praise unto him, the Seraphim, the Ophanim and the holy Chayoth ascribing glory and greatness</p>  
 <p>To the God who rested from all his works, and on the seventh day exalted himself and sat upon the throne of his glory; who robed himself in glory on the day of rest, and called the Sabbath day a delight. This is the praise of the Sabbath day, that God rested thereon from all his work, when the Sabbath day itself offered praise and said, "A Psalm, a song of the Sabbath day, It is good to give thanks into the Lord." <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_18"><font size="1">*</font></a> Therefore let all his creatures glorify and bless God; let them render praise, honor</p>

 <p>and greatness to the God and King who is Creator of all things, and who, in his holiness, giveth an inheritance of rest to his people Israel on the holy Sabbath day. Thy name, O Lord our God, shall be hallowed, and thy remembrance, O our King, shall be glorified in heaven above and on earth beneath. Be thou blessed, O our Savior, for the excellency of thy handiwork, and for the bright luminaries which thou hast made: they shall glorify thee for ever.</p>  
 <p>Be thou blessed, O our Rock, our King and Redeemer, Creator of holy beings, praised be thy name for ever, O our King; Creator of ministering spirits, all of whom stand in the heights of the universe, and proclaim with awe in unison aloud the words of the living God and everlasting King. All of them are beloved, pure and mighty, and all of them in dread and awe do the will of their Master: and all of them open their mouths in holiness and purity, with song and psalm, while they bless and praise, glorify and reverence, sanctify and ascribe sovereignty to—</p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>The name of the Divine King, the great, mighty and dreaded One, holy is he; and they all take upon themselves the yoke of the kingdom of heaven one from the other, and give sanction to one another to hallow their Creator: in tranquil joy of spirit, with pure speech and holy melody they all respond in unison, and exclaim with awe:</p>  
 <p><big>Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.</big></p>  
 <p>And the Ophanim and the holy Chayoth with a noise of great rushing, upraising themselves towards the Seraphim, thus over against them offer praise and say:</p>  
 <p><big>Blessed be the glory of the Lord from his place.</big></p>  
 <p>To the blessed God they offer pleasant melodies; to the King, the living and ever-enduring God, they utter hymns and make their praises heard; for he alone performeth mighty deeds, and maketh new things; he is the Lord of battles; he soweth righteousness, causeth salvation to spring forth, createth remedies, and is revered in praises. He is the Lord of wonders, who in his goodness reneweth the creation every day continually; as it is said, (O give thanks) to him that maketh great lights, for his lovingkindness</p>

 <p>endureth for ever. O cause a new light to shine upon Zion, and may we all be worthy soon to enjoy its brightness. Blessed art thou, O Lord, Creator of the luminaries.</p>  
 <p>With abounding love hast thou loved us, O Lord our God, with great and exceeding pity hast thou pitied us. O our Father, our King, for our fathers’ sake, who trusted in thee, and whom thou didst teach the statutes of life, be also gracious unto us and teach us. O our Father, merciful Father, ever-compassionate, have mercy upon us: O put it into our hearts to understand and to discern, to mark, learn and teach, to heed, to do and to fulfil in love all the words of instruction in thy Law. Enlighten our eyes in thy Law, and let our hearts cleave to thy commandments, and unite our hearts to love and fear thy name, so that we be never put to shame. Because we have trusted in thy holy, great and revered name, we shall rejoice and be glad in thy salvation. O bring us in peace from the four corners of the earth, and make us go upright to our land; for thou art a God who worketh salvation. Thou hast chosen us from all peoples and tongues, and hast brought us near unto thy great name for ever in faithfulness, that we might in love give thanks unto thee and proclaim thy unity. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast chosen thy people Israel in love.</p>

 <p>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign -upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.</p>

And I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; and the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and the land yield not her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes.

 <p>True and firm, established and enduring, right and faithful, beloved and precious, desirable and pleasant, revered and mighty, well-ordered and acceptable, good and beautiful is this thy word unto us for ever and ever. It is true, the God of the universe is our King, the Rock of Jacob, the Shield of our salvation: throughout all generations he endureth and his name endureth; his throne is established, and his kingdom and his faithfulness endure for ever. His words also live and endure; they are faithful and desirable for ever and to all eternity, as for our fathers so also for us, our children, our generations, and for all the generations of the seed of Israel his servants.</p>  
 <p>For the first and for the last ages thy word is good and endureth for ever and ever; it is true and trust, worthy, a statute which shall not pass away. True it is that thou art indeed the Lord our God and the God of our fathers, our King, our fathers’ King, our Redeemer, the Redeemer of our fathers, our Maker, the Rock of our salvation; our Deliverer and Rescuer from everlasting, such is thy name; there is no God beside thee.</p>

True it is that thou art indeed the first and thou art the last beside thee we have no King, Redeemer and Savior. From Egypt thou didst redeem us, O Lord our God, and from the house of bondmen thou didst deliver us; all their first-born thou didst slay, but thy first-born thou didst redeem; thou didst divide the Red Sea, and drown the proud; but thou madest the beloved to pass through, while the waters covered their adversaries, not one of whom was left. Wherefore the beloved praised and extolled God, and offered hymns, songs, praises, blessings and thanksgivings to the King and God, who liveth and endureth; who is high and exalted, great and revered; who bringeth low the haughty, and raiseth up the lowly, leadeth forth the prisoners, delivereth the meek, helpeth the poor, and answereth his people when they cry unto him; even praises to the Most High God, blessed is he, and ever to be blessed. Moses and the children of Israel sang a song unto thee with great joy, saying. all of them,</p>

Blessings and thanksgivings be to thy great and holy name, because thou hast kept us in life and hast preserved us; so mayest thou continue to keep us in life and to preserve us. O gather our exiles to thy holy courts to observe thy statutes, to do thy will, and to serve thee with a perfect heart; seeing that we give thanks unto thee. Blessed be the God to whom thanksgivings are due.</small></div>  
 <p>We give thanks unto thee, for thou art the Lord our God and the God of our fathers for ever and ever; thou art the Rock of our lives, the Shield of our salvation through every generation. We will give thanks unto thee and declare thy praise for our lives which are committed into thy hand, and for our souls which are in thy charge, and for thy miracles, which are daily with us, and for thy wonders and thy benefits, which are wrought at all times, evening, morn and noon. O thou who art all-good, whose mercies fail not; thou, merciful Being, whose lovingkindnesses never cease, we have ever hoped in thee.</p>

 <p><small>O inscribe all the children of thy covenant for a happy life.</small></p>  
 <p>And everything that liveth shall give thanks unto thee for ever, and shall praise thy name in truth, O God, our salvation and our help. Blessed art thou, O Lord, whose name is All-good, and unto whom it is becoming to give thanks.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>At the repetition of the Amidah by the Reader the following is introduced:—</i></p>  
 <p><small>Our God and God of our fathers, bless us with the three-fold blessing of thy Law written by the hand of Moses thy servant, which was spoken by Aaron and his sons, the priests, thy holy people, as it is said, The Lord bless thee, and keep thee: the Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee: the Lord turn his face unto thee, and give thee peace.</small></p>  
 <p>Grant peace, welfare, blessing, grace, lovingkindness and mercy unto us and unto all Israel, thy people. Bless us, O our Father, even all of us together, with the light of thy countenance; for by the light of thy countenance thou hast given us, O Lord our God, the Law</p>  
 <p><a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></a></p>  
 <p>of life, lovingkindness and righteousness, blessing, mercy, life and peace; and may it be good in thy sight to bless thy people Israel at all times and in every hour with thy peace.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>On the Sabbath of Penitence say:—</i></p>  
 <p><small>In the book of life, blessing, peace and good sustenance may we be remembered and inscribed before thee, we and all thy people the house of Israel, for a happy life and for peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who makest peace.</small></p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord, who blessest thy people Israel with peace.</p>  
 <p>O my God! guard my tongue from evil and my lips from speaking guile; and to such as curse me let my soul be dumb, yea, let my soul be unto all as the dust. Open my heart to thy Law, and let my soul pursue thy commandments. If any design evil against me, speedily make their counsel of none effect, and frustrate their designs. Do it for the sake of thy name, do it for the sake of thy right hand, do it for the sake of thy holiness, do it for the sake of thy Law. In order that thy beloved ones may be delivered, O save with thy right hand, and answer me. Let the words of my mouth</p>

 <p>and the meditation of my heart be acceptable before thee, O Lord, my Rock and my Redeemer. He who</p>  
 <p>maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel, and say ye, Amen.</p>  
 <p>May it be thy will, O Lord our God and God of our fathers, that the temple be speedily rebuilt in our days, and grant our portion in thy Law. And there we will serve thee with awe, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years. Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant unto the Lord, as in the days of old, and as in ancient years.</p>

 <p>Who in mercy givest light to the earth and to them that dwell thereon, and in thy goodness re-newest the creation every day continually. How manifold are thy works, O Lord! In wisdom hast thou made them all: the earth is full of thy possessions. O King, who alone wast exalted <a name="page_187"><font size="1" color="green">p. 187</font></a> from aforetime, praised, glorified and extolled from days of old; O everlasting God, in thine abundant mercies, have mercy upon us, Lord of our strength Rock of our stronghold, Shield of our salvation, thou Stronghold of ours! The blessed God, great in knowledge, prepared and formed the rays of the sun: it was a boon he produced as a glory to his name: he set the luminaries round about his strength. The chiefs of his hosts are holy beings that exalt the Almighty, and continually <a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="green">p. 189</font></a> declare the glory of God and his holiness. Be thou blessed, O Lord our God, for the excellency of thy handiwork, and for the bright luminaries which thou hast made: they shall glorify thee for ever.</p>
