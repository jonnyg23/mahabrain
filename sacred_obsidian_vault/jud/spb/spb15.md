 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px"><small>Blessed, praised, glorified, exalted and extolled be the name of the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who is the first and the last, and beside him there is no God.

 <p><i>Cong. and Reader</i>.—Blessed is the Lord who is to be blessed for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p>Blessed art thou, O Lord our God, King of the universe, who at thy word bringest on the evening twilight, with wisdom openest the gates of the heavens, and with understanding changest times and variest the seasons, and arrangest the stars in their watches in the sky, according to thy will. Thou createst day and night; thou rollest away the light from before the darkness, and the darkness from before the light; thou makest the day to pass and the night to approach, and dividest the day from the night, the Lord of hosts is thy name; a God living and enduring continually, mayest thou reign over us for ever and ever. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who bringest on the evening twilight.</p>  
 <p>With everlasting love thou hast loved the house of Israel, thy people; a Law and commandments, statutes and judgments hast thou taught us. Therefore. O Lord</p>  
 <p><a name="page_160"><font size="1" color="green">p. 160</font></a></p>  
 <p>our God, when we lie down and when we rise up we will meditate on thy statutes: yea, we will rejoice in the words of thy Law and in thy commandments for ever; for they are our life and the length of our days and we will meditate on them day and night. And mayest thou never take away thy love from us. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who lovest thy people Israel.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>When Prayers are not said with the Congregation, add:—</i></p>

 <p align="center">Deut. vi. 4–9.</p>  
 <p>Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is One.</p>  
 <p><small>Blessed be His name, whose glorious kingdom is for ever and ever.</small></p>  
 <p>And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might. And these words, which I command thee this day, shalt be upon thine heart: and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they shall be for frontlets between thine eyes. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thy house, and upon thy gates.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_161"><font size="1" color="green">p. 161</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">Deut. xi. 13–21.</p>  
 <p>And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto my commandments which I command you this day, to love the Lord your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul, that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil. And I will give grass in thy field for thy cattle, and thou shalt eat and be satisfied. Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them; and the anger of the Lord be kindled against you, and he shut up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield not her fruit; and ye perish quickly from off the good land which the Lord giveth you. Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul: and ye shall bind them for a sign upon your</p>  
 <p><a name="page_162"><font size="1" color="green">p. 162</font></a></p>  
 <p>hand, and they shall be for frontlets between your eyes. And ye shall teach them your children, talking of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when thou risest up. And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house, and upon thy gates: that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, upon the land which the Lord sware unto your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.</p>  
 <p align="center">Numbers xv. 37–41.</p>  
 <p>And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make them a fringe upon the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and that they put upon the fringe of each corner a cord of blue: and it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the Lord, and do them; and that ye go not about after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray: that ye may remember and do</p>

 <p>all my commandments, and be holy unto your God. I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the Land of Egypt, to be your God; I am the Lord your God.</p>  
 <p>True and trustworthy is all this, and it is established with us that he is the Lord our God, and there is none beside him, and that we, Israel, are his people. It is he who redeemed us from the hand of kings, even our King, who delivered us from the grasp of all the terrible ones; the God, who on our behalf dealt out punishment to our adversaries, and requited all the enemies of our soul; who doeth great things past finding out, yea, and wonders without number; who holdeth our soul in life, and hath not suffered our feet to be moved; who made us tread upon the high places of our enemies, and exalted our horn over all them that hated us; who wrought for us miracles and vengeance upon Pharaoh, signs and wonders in the land of the children of Ham; who in his wrath smote all the first-born of Egypt, and brought forth his</p>  
 <p><a name="page_164"><font size="1" color="green">p. 164</font></a></p>  
 <p>people Israel from among them to everlasting freedom; who made his children pass between the divisions of the Red Sea, but sank their pursuers and their enemies in the depths. Then his children beheld his might; they praised and gave thanks unto his name, and willingly accepted his sovereignty. Moses and the children of Israel sang a song unto thee with great joy, saying, all of them,</p>  
 <p>Who is like unto thee, O Lord, among the mighty ones? Who is like unto thee, glorious in holiness, revered in praises, doing wonders?</p>  
 <p><small>Thy children beheld thy sovereign power, as thou didst cleave the sea before Moses: they exclaimed, This is my God! and said,</small></p>  
 <p>The Lord shall reign for ever and ever.</p>  
 <p>And it is said, For the Lord hath delivered Jacob, and redeemed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who hast redeemed Israel.</p>  
 <p>Cause us, O Lord our God, to lie down in peace, and raise us up, O our King, unto life. Spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace; direct us aright through thine own good counsel; save us for thy name's sake; be thou a shield about us; remove from is every enemy, pestilence, sword, famine and sorrow;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_165"><font size="1" color="green">p. 165</font></a></p>  
 <p><small>remove also the adversary from before us and from behind us. O shelter us beneath the shadow of thy wings; for thou, O God, art our Guardian and our Deliverer; yea, thou, O God, art a gracious and merciful King; and guard our going out and our coming in unto life and unto peace from this time forth and for evermore; yea, spread over us the tabernacle of thy peace. Blessed art thou, O Lord, who spreadest the tabernacle of peace over us and over all thy people Israel, and over Jerusalem.</small></p>

 <p>And the heaven and the earth were finished and all their host. And on the seventh day God had finished his work which he had made; and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had made.

 <p align="center"><i>The following is not said on Festivals, on the Intermediate Sabbath of a Festival, or on the evening after a Festival:—</i></p>  
 <p align="center">Mishnah, Treatise Sabbath, ch. ii.</p>  
 <p>1. With what materials may the Sabbath lamp be lighted, and with what may it not be lighted? It may not be lighted with cedar-bast, nor with uncombed flax, nor with floss-silk, nor with willow-fibre, nor with nettle fibre, nor with waterweeds</p>  
 <p><a name="page_175"><font size="1" color="green">p. 175</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (all these forming imperfect wicks). It may also not be lighted with pitch, nor with liquid wax, nor with oil made from the seeds of the cotton plant, nor with oil which, having been set apart as a heave-offering and having become defiled, is condemned to be destroyed by burning, nor with the fat from the tails of sheep, nor with tallow. Nahum the Mede, says one may use tallow when it has been boiled, but the other sages say, that whether so prepared or not, it may not be used. 2. On a festival one may not use such consecrated oil as has been condemned, after defilement, to be burnt. R. Ishmael says, one may not, from respect to the Sabbath, use tar. The sages permit the use of all kinds of oil; the oil of sesamum, of nuts, of radish seeds, of fish, of colocynth seeds, as well as tar and naphtha. R. Tarphon says, one may use no other than olive oil for lighting the Sabbath lamp. 3. No part of a tree may be used as a wick for lighting, with the exception of flax (spoken of in Joshua ii. 6 as "the flax of a tree"); nor is any part of a tree, if used in the construction of a tent, capable of acquiring pollution according to the law concerning the pollution of tents, except flax. If a slip of cloth has been folded but not singed, R. Eliezer says it may become unclean, and may not be used as a wick for lighting; R. Akiba says it remains clean, and may be used. 4. One may not perforate an egg-shell, fill it with oil, and place it above the opening of the lamp, so that drops of oil may fall therein; he may not even employ an earthenware vessel in this manner; but R. Jehudah permits it. If, however, the potter had originally joined the two parts, then it is allowed, because it is actually only one vessel. A person may not fill a bowl with oil, place it by the side of the lamp, and put the end of the wick into it, so that it may draw the oil to the flame; but R. Jehudah permits it. 5. He who extinguishes the light, because he is in fear of heathens, or robbers, or of en evil spirit. or to enable a sick person to sleep, is absolved;</p>  
 <p><a name="page_176"><font size="1" color="green">p. 176</font></a></p>  
 <p>if his object is to save the lamp, the oil, or the wick, he is guilty of a breach of the Sabbath law. R. Jose absolves from such guilt in every case except in that of the one whose object is to save the wick, because by thus extinguishing it, he converts it into a coal. 6. For three transgressions women die in childbirth: because they have been negligent in regard to their periods of separation, in respect to the consecration of the first cake of the dough, and in the lighting of the Sabbath lamp. 7. Three things a man must say to his household on Sabbath eve towards dusk: Have ye separated the tithe? Have ye made the Erub? Kindle the Sabbath lamp. If it be doubtful whether it is dark, that which is certainly untithed must not then be tithed, vessels must not be immersed to purify them from their defilement, nor must the Sabbath lamps be lighted; but that which is doubtfully untithed may be tithed, the Erub may be made, and hot victuals may be covered to retain their heat.</p>  
 <p align="center">Talmud Babli. End of Treatise Berachoth.</p>  
 <p>R. Eleazar said in the name of R. Chanina, The disciples of the sages increase peace throughout the world, as it is said, And all thy children shall be taught of the Lord; and great shall be the peace of thy children. (Read not here <i>banayich</i>, by children, but <i>bonayich</i>, thy builders.)—Great peace have they who love thy Law; and there is no stumbling for them. Peace be within thy rampart, prosperity within thy palaces. For my brethren and companions’ sakes I would fain speak peace concerning thee. For the sake of the house of the Lord our God I would seek thy good. The Lord will give strength unto his people; the Lord will bless his people with peace.</p>  
 <p align="center"><i>Kiddush is said by the Reader, <a href="spb16.htm#page_181">p. 181</a></i>.</p>  
 <p>It is our duty to praise the Lord of all things, to ascribe greatness to him who formed the world in the beginning, since he hath not made us like the nations of other lands, and hath not placed us</p>  
 <p><a name="page_177"><font size="1" color="green">p. 177</font></a></p>  
 <p>like other families of the earth, since he hath not assigned unto us a portion as unto them, nor a lot as unto all their multitude. For we bend the knee and offer worship and thanks before the supreme King of kings, the Holy One, blessed be he, who stretched forth the heavens and laid the foundations of the earth, the seat of whose glory is in the heavens above, and the abode of whose might is in the loftiest heights. He is our God; there is none else; in truth he is our King; there is none besides him; as it is written in his Law, And thou shalt know this day, and lay it to thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above and upon the earth beneath: there is none else.</p>  
 <p>We therefore hope in thee, O Lord our God, that we may speedily behold the glory of thy might, when thou wilt remove the abominations from the earth, and the idols will be utterly cut off, when the world will be perfected under the kingdom of the Almighty, and all the children of flesh will call upon thy name, when thou wilt turn unto thyself all the wicked of the earth. Let all the inhabitants of the world perceive and know that unto thee every knee must bow, every tongue must swear. Before thee, O Lord our God, let them bow and fall; and unto thy glorious name let them give honor; let them all accept the yoke of thy kingdom, and do thou reign over them speedily, and for ever and ever. For the kingdom is thine, and to all eternity thou wilt reign in glory; as it is written in thy Law,</p>

 <p align="center"><i>The following Kaddish is said by a Mourner</i>.</p>  
 <p><i>Mourner</i>.—Magnified and sanctified be his great name in the world which he hath created according to his will. May he establish his kingdom during your if e and during your days, and during the life of all the house of Israel, even speedily and at a near time, and say ye, Amen.</p>  
 <p><i>Cong. and Mourner</i>.—Let his great name be blessed for ever and to all eternity.</p>  
 <p><i>Mourner</i>.—Blessed, praised and glorified, exalted, extolled and honored, magnified and lauded be the name of the Holy One, blessed be he; though he be high above all the blessings and hymns, praises and consolations, which are uttered in the world; and say ye, Amen.</p>  
 <p><i>Cong</i>.—Let the name of the Lord be blessed from this time forth and for evermore.</p>  
 <p><i>Mourner</i>.—May there be abundant peace from heaven, and life for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.</p>  
 <p><i>Cong</i>.—My help is from the Lord, who made heaven and earth.</p>  
 <p><i>Mourner</i>.—He who maketh peace in his high places, may he make peace for us and for all Israel; and say ye, Amen.</p>  
 <p>1. Magnified and praised be the living God: he is, and there is no limit in time unto his being.</p>  
 <p>2. He is One, and there is no unity like unto his unity; inconceivable is he, and unending is his unity.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_179"><font size="1" color="green">p. 179</font></a></p>  
 <p>3. He hath neither bodily form nor substance: we can compare nought unto him in his holiness.</p>  
 <p>4. He was before anything that hath been created—even the first: but his existence had no beginning.</p>  
 <p>5. Behold he is the Lord of the universe: to every creature he teacheth his greatness and his sovereignty.</p>  
 <p>6. The rich gift of his prophecy he gave unto the men of his choice, in whom he gloried.</p>  
 <p>7. There hath never yet arisen in Israel a prophet like unto Moses, one who hath beheld his similitude.</p>  
 <p>8. The Law of truth God gave unto his people by the hand of his prophet, who was faithful in his house.</p>  
 <p>9. God will not alter nor change his Law to ever, lasting for any other.</p>  
 <p>10. He watcheth and knoweth our secret thoughts: he beholdeth the end of a thing before it existeth.</p>  
 <p>11. He bestoweth lovingkindness upon a man according to his work; he giveth to the wicked evil according to his wickedness.</p>  
 <p>12. He will send our anointed at the end of days, to redeem them that wait for the end—his salvation.</p>  
 <p>13. In the abundance of his lovingkindness God will quicken the dead. Blessed for evermore be his glorious name.</p>

 <p align="center">The following is said in the Home by the Master of the House:—</p>  
 <p align="center">Proverbs xxxi. 10–31.</p>  
 <p>A woman of worth who can find? For her price is far above rubies. The heart of her husband trusteth in her; and he shall have no lack of gain. She doeth him good and not evil all the days of her life. She seeketh wool and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands. She is like the merchant-ships; she bringeth her food from afar. She riseth also while it is yet night, and setteth forth provision for her household, and their portion for her maidens. She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineyard. She girdeth her loins with strength, and maketh strong her arms. She perceiveth that her earnings are good: her lamp goeth not out by night. She putteth her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she putteth forth her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of the snow for her household; for all her household are clothed with scarlet. She maketh for herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is fine linen and purple. Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the elders of the land. She maketh linen garments and selleth them; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant. Strength and majesty are her clothing; and she laugheth at the time to come. She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and the law of lovingkindness is on her tongue. She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and call her happy; her husband also, and he praiseth her, saying, Many daughters have done worthily, but thou excellest them all. Favor is false, and beauty is vain; but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her works praise her in the gates.</p>
