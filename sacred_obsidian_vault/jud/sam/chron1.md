 <p>Preface.</p>
 
 <p>~~~~~~~~~</p>
 
 <p>   The Samaritan Book
 of Joshua was first brought to the notice of European scholars by the eminent
 Orientalist, Joseph J. Scaliger, who obtained a manuscript of it from the
 Samaritans of Cairo, in the year 1584. This MS. was deposited by him in the
 library of the University of Leyden, and for a long period remained the only
 copy of the work in Europe; in fact, it is only within the last half of the
 present century that other MSS. have been obtained; one of these is now in the
 possession of the British Museum, and another is said to be in the library of
 trinity College, Cambridge. To the celebrated Swiss theologian and scholar,
 Johann Heinrich Hottinger, is due the credit of making the contents of this
 work fully known to scholars; this he did in his <i>Exercitationes
 Anti-Moriniance de Pentateucho Samaritano</i>, published in 1644, wherein he
 gave a condensed Latin translation, or rather epitome, of the whole chronicle:
 he likewise treated of it in other of his writings, especially in his <i>Smegma
 Orient</i>, (1657), which contains a fair resume' of its contents. Hottinger's
 works remained the principle source from which scholars drew their information
 of the character and contents of this chronicle of the Samaritans, until in the
 year 1848, T.W.J. Juynboll edited the Arabic text of the Leyden MS. with a
 complete Latin translation to which were added elaborate dissertations and
 copious critical notes. This translation of Juynboll's at once superseded all
 that had preceded it, and has ever since remained the standard.</p>
 
 <p><b>   The translation now offered- the first that
 has ever been attempted in English- is made directly from the Arabic text as
 printed by Juynboll, while the MS. in the British Museum has been examined and
 consulted in many cases. To those who may take the trouble to compare this
 English translation with Juynboll's Latin, it may occasion surprise to find
 that, in the interpretation of a considerable number of passages they
 materially differ; if such will, however, only turn to the original Arabic and
 consult it, the writer confidently believes that the English rendering will be
 found to more exactly represent the original than the Latin. It should be borne
 in mind, however, that the Leyden MS. is in the Samaritan characters, though written
 in the Arabic language, which the scribe often wrote in a most careless and
 negligent manner, and hence the MS. is in many places exceedingly difficult to
 decipher. Juynboll edited it in Arabic characters, but, on account of the
 wretchedness of the writing, was often driven to conjectural readings and
 emendations, yet he always placed in the margin the exact, or supposed, words
 of the text, thus affording the student an opportunity to form an independent
 judgment as to the justice and accuracy of his emendations, and upon careful
 consideration one is sometimes forced to the conclusion that Juynboll has
 unintentionally erred, both in his reading of the text and in his conjectural
 corrections, and that the discarded words in the margin are in some cases to be
 preferred to his attempted improvements. These facts will explain some of the
 variations which distinguish this translation from the Latin one of Juynboll. </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   It is not the intention of the writer to
 detract one whit from the praise which is due to Juynboll, for the care he
 bestowed upon his work and for his truly able translation and the scholarly and
 erudite notes that he added to it; to all of which the writer here makes
 acknowledgment of his great indebtedness. </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   Next to the Jews there is scarcely any
 people that excite the interest of biblical students more warmly than the
 Samaritans. Their origin, their history, their literature and their traditions
 are questions that have brought to their investigation a succession of able
 scholars, and are to day still subjects of intense interest and research. The
 present translation is put forth with the hope that it may not be unwelcome to
 the many who are interested in these subjects, but to whom this Chronicle in
 the original language has been a sealed book.</b></p>
 
 <p><b>   Among the Samaritans themselves this book
 is not held to be of Divine inspiration- for they believe that only the five
 books of Moses are inspired- nevertheless, they greatly revere it and hold it
 in the highest estimation, and believe it to contain a true and authentic
 history of the period of which it treats. 
 As to when it was composed and who was its author we have no positive
 knowledge. From the inscription which the Leyden MS. bears we learn that the first
 part of the codex, as it now stands, was written in A.D. 1362-3, and the latter
 part in A.D. 1513. Juynboll's researches led him to the conclusion that it was
 redacted into its present form about A.D. 1300, out of earlier documents. This
 is probably the fact, and it is all that can be safely predicated as to the
 time of its compilation.</b></p>
 
 <p><b>   A marked feature of the book is the number
 of legends and traditions it contains, some of which- so far as we are aware-
 are to be met with nowhere else. Most of them, however, are intimately
 connected with similar legends current in the East, and show a common origin
 with those of the Jews, and frequently with those of the Mohammedans. In the
 notes an effort has been made to notice such Jewish or Moslem legends and
 traditions as are identical or show an affinity with those mentioned in the
 text, in order that the reader may see wherein the various versions agree or
 differ. Care has been taken also to identify, so far as it was possible, all
 places or localities mentioned in the Chronicle, and to give their ancient
 Hebrew names. This, it is believed, will not be without value to all such as
 are unfamiliar with the modern Arabic names of the places in Palestine, and who
 might otherwise be at a loss to know the Arabic names in the Chronicle.</b></p>
 
 <p><b>   To all who are interested in the history,
 geography and legends of Palestine this Chronicle of the Samaritans will be of
 particular interest; and while it is not to be denied that many of its
 statements are incredible, still the fact that much of it contains is of true value
 and is not to be ignored, but may be used discriminately to good advantage by
 scholars to shed light upon a large range of subjects, our knowledge of which
 is and always has been extremely limited; in support of this we might refer to
 the recognition it has received at the hands of such writers as Bishop Patrick,
 Dean Stanley, Capt. Condor and others.</b></p>
 
 <p><b>   In conclusion, the translator wishes to
 express his obligation to his father, Rev. Oliver Crane, DD., LL.D., for his
 kindly interest and encouragement throughout, and for many good criticisms and
 suggestions in revising the manuscript, and also to his friend Antun `Abdallah
 Salih of Beirut, Syria, for valuable assistance in interpreting certain obscure
 and corrupt passages in the original.</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER I.</p>
 
 <p>IN THE NAME OF GOD, THE COMPASSIONATE.</p>
 
 <p><b>  </b></p>
 
 <p><b> This is the book narrating the chronicles of
 the children of Israil, from the time that our master Musa (Moses), the
 prophet- peace be upon him- the son of `Amran, invested Yush'a (Joshua) the son
 of Nun with the Kalifate over his people. All of this is translated from the
 Hebrew language into the Arabic language, after the manner of a rapid
 translation by word of mouth, and giving only the statement of the narrative,
 and nothing more: even what God- Powerful and Glorious- showed forth of signs
 and miracles and wonders, which man is too weak to adequately specify and
 describe; such as, what happened at the Urdun (Jordan), and also at the time
 when the giants were humbled, and with what victory and power and might and
 authority God came to his (Joshua's) assistance; also what they (the children
 of Israel) witnessed at the time of their entering the land, besides what they
 witnessed in Wady el-Mujib, and on mount Sina (Sinai) and its vast wilderness,
 with the essential incidents of this event which God made manifest, even the
 quaking of its mountains, together with what there was of thunders and
 lightnings connected with this, and joining the fires to the very heaven, and
 their hearing the code of their laws from the divine and eternal voice, from
 whom shone forth flashes of light, representing the form of its writer, even
 the Creator. Afterwards what happened to them at the greater Sea, not to
 mention what their adversaries witnessed in Greater Misr (Egypt), and what
 calamities overtook their enemies, such as Fir'aun (Pharaoh) and his army, and
 `Amlaq (the Amalekites) and its host, and Sihun (Sihon) and his kingdom, and
 `Uj (Og) the father of `Anaq with his sorcery, and kings of Mab (Moab) with
 their greatness. Also what happened unto Qarun (Korah) the son of the uncle of
 Harun (Aaron) and to the company who were with him, namely that some of them
 the earth opened its mouth and swallowed, and they went down alive to the
 deepest depths, while as to others of them the divine fire came forth and
 consumed their bodies. And also what happened to the people while they were in
 the wilderness forty years, suffering want, without a guide and with no
 provisions or clothing, and barely living and existing; whom the cloud
 overshadowed by day and the pillar of fire protected from cold by night, and
 whose food was the manna from heaven; and when there was need of water, our
 master Musa- peace be upon him- the son of `Amran, brought it forth for them
 from the rock and from the parched ground and stone, until they themselves had
 drank, and all that were in the company both living souls and animals. And it
 shall come to pass, that when they who are possessed of intelligence, but are
 yet unbelieving, shall have heard of what God did bountifully bestow upon them
 (the children of Israel), and with what happiness He did surround them, and how
 He lifted off of them all calamities, whether heavenly or earthly, and also
 what new things He revealed unto them, then they will know that, there is no
 Lord but their (the children of Israel) Lord and no prophet, but their prophet,
 and no book but their Book, and no true religion but their religion; and (they
 shall also understand) the excellency of the perfect creed, and the certainly
 of its validity, and that it is greatest in rendering praise to the Creator-
 Mighty and Glorious- the One who is omnipotent to do whatever He pleaseth. And
 when one shall hear of the decline of the kingdom of the children of Israil,
 and what calamities and misfortunes and exiles and dispersions overtook them by
 reason of their disobedient doings and their rebellious actions, his fear will
 be increased for Him from Whom nothing escapes and of Whose kingdom nothing is
 destroyed- Blessed be he and exalted! And now of Him do we implore complete
 right-guidance and all-embracing favor in His mercy. Verily He is a hearer and
 answerer (of prayer). </b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER II</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF THE INVESTURE OF YUSH'A THE
 SON OF NUN WITH THE KHALIFATE OF THE PROPHET- PEACE BE UPON HIM.</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   At the completion of the hundred and
 nineteenth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, of the life of our
 master Musa the prophet- peace be upon him- God revealed unto him in the plain
 of Mab (Moab), that he should lay his hand upon the head of Yush'a, the son of
 Nun, the spiritual man; meaning by this, that he (Moses) should give him
 (Joshua) information of the profound secret, and revealed to him the vision of
 his dream and the science of knowledge, as much as he was capable of bearing;
 by the which his heart would be strengthened and his spirit perfected and his
 soul elevated, and the rule over the creatures (the children of Israel) be
 rendered easy unto him; and that he should also inform him of the Name, by
 which he should put to flight hostile armies, and by which a nation that no
 country could contain and whose numbers were countless might be confounded. And
 He ordered him(Moses) to set him (Joshua) before el-`Azar (Eleazar) the imam-
 peace be upon him- and to assemble unto him(Joshua) the people of learning and
 knowledge with the nobles and rulers, and ratify a compact with him, and make a
 new covenant with him, and invest him with the kingly authority, and install
 him in the rule over all the children of Israil. Thereupon the Prophet laid on
 el-`Azar the imam- peace be upon him- the command, which rested on him, to
 superintend the affair with completeness and splendor, and not to enter upon
 any affair or turn aside under any circumstance, except after he had seen to
 this. And at the completion of his inauguration, the priests sounded with
 trumpets, and the heralds made proclamation for his standard, and the banners
 and flags were unfurled to his reign. Our master, the prophet Musa- peace be
 upon him- had seen that he (Joshua) was wont to go forth in the front line of
 battle during his (Moses') days, in order that he might by actual trial gain
 experience of what he knew and had observed. And immediately he (Moses) gave
 command that, there should be selected out from the children of Israil- meaning
 by this, that there should be chosen from among them- twelve thousand men; from
 each tribe one thousand men; and thereupon he would with these make an attack
 upon the Midyanites, to take satisfaction for Israil out of them and their country.
 Now, before mention is made of the cause of this retaliation, we would remark,
 that the children of Israil had been restrained from intermeddling in any way
 with the affairs of the `Ammanites and Mabites, and were under orders not to
 appropriate to themselves any of their territory; and they did do only what
 necessity compelled them to do with them. Hereafter we will explain and
 elucidate this, by the will of God and his assistance, and the goodness of his
 guidance and favor.</b></p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p>CHAPTER III</p>
 
 <p>THE AFFAIR OF BILA'AM WITH THE KING OF MAB.</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   When the children of Israil went down into
 the plain of Mab, God revealed unto our master Musa, God revealed unto our
 master Musa, the Prophet- upon him be the most excellent peace- that he should
 not have anything to do with the `Ammanites and Mabites, nor should he wage war
 with them; "Because I," said God, "will not appropriate any of their lands to
 the children of Israil." And he (Moses) obeyed this and did accordingly. Now
 when it reached the ears of the kings of Mab and `Amman and Midyan what had
 happened unto Sihun and `Ug, of destruction and ruin and the taking captive of
 people and the talking of cities, forsooth they were sore distressed and feared
 exceedingly because of this; and they sent messages unto Bila'am, the son of
 B'aur (Beor), by men pre-eminent in sorcery and wisdom- for all the solders
 knew of him by reason of his invocations. And the delegates came into his
 presence, and said unto him: "The five kings of Mab and `Amman send unto thee
 their salutations, and say to thee: O, our master and our chief, we know that
 circumstances are brought about by thee, a knowledge of which the people of
 learning fall short of attaining unto, and that whatsoever thou blessest, is
 blessed, and whomever thou cursest, is cursed; and that thou canst put to route
 all armies by thy invocations and words. Now, perchance, there has already
 reached thee  what has happened in Misr
 through the children of Israil, and in the sea and in the wilderness, and what
 happened unto `Amlaq, the chief of tribes, by reason of them, and what they did
 with Sihun and `Ug, and what they have resolved upon in reference to their
 permanent dwelling-places. And now their army has descended upon our border,
 and they are working for our destruction, and already they cover the face of
 the land; and we have come unto thee and hope to obtain relief of thee and
 security from them, through thy own free blessing and propitious aid, and also
 through what we have decided upon of happiness for thee, and the rendering of
 thy will absolute. Perchance now, our condition will be improved through thy
 agency, and thou wilt curse this people, and wilt prevail over them and effect
 a change in present circumstances through thy renown which is spread abroad,
 and the dignity of thy authority in consequence of thy circumstances, riches
 and servants; and there will be glory to us and to thee among all kings, in
 addition to what reward will be added unto this, in consideration for thy grand
 beneficence toward a people whom no country can obtain, and whose numbers are
 countless and beyond reckoning; for thou wilt have prevented a multitude from
 being murdered by fire. For the character and manner of this army is, that it
 is not restrained by a feeling of shame from an old man, nor does it accord
 protection to a woman, or have pity on a child, or show compassion toward an
 animal; for they do nothing else but murder with the sword, and stone to death
 with stones, and crucify, and burn with fire: yea, this is its custom, and it
 does not allow any mercy to be shown, or protection to be granted, unto any and
 it spares not even a leafless palm branch in its annihilating and destroying.
 By God, O our master, hasten unto us, bringing with thee whatever is necessary,
 and be not wanting unto us in this matter which involves the preservation of
 life, and we will reward a good deed with its like, and an evil deed with its
 like. And now, peace."</b></p>
 
 <p><b>   And when Bila'am heard this message, he
 made reply to the company of wise and trained men, and said unto them: "I will
 treat with due respect your rights, and the rights of those who urge you on in
 this message; but my action is controlled by the One whom I serve, if He gives
 me permission to go with you, I would accomplish your desire and the desire of
 those who urge you on in the message, and I would accomplish their (the
 children of Israil's) destruction, and in the end complete their annihilation,
 and would leave unto you a memory, for which you would praise me to the end of
 the ages. And now decide to lodge with me this night, and I will hear what
 shall be addressed unto me, and we will wholly act in accordance therewith,
 whether it be of good or evil." And the people consented, and lodged with him.
 And he began to offer worship to the One whom he was accustomed to serve, and
 it was said unto him: "Do not thou go with the people, nor curse Israil, for
 they are blessed." And he came to them with these words; thereupon they
 returned to the kings, and informed them of what had happened; but this only increased
 the more their desire after them, and this was high honor to him. And now there
 rode unto Bila'am more illustrious delegates than those who had gone before,
 and greater by far than they; yet they made less promises to him, and said in
 the second message: "Now see to it that thou comest unto us; for we are able to
 honor thee, and to give bountifully unto thee." Thereupon the people came unto
 him with this message; and Bila'am answered the messengers and said: "It is
 necessary that ye understand that, if the kings should give unto me their
 houses full of silver and gold, I cannot transgress what my Lord commands; but
 now abide this night with me, and I will hear what communication shall be
 addressed to me, and I will act in accordance with it, whether it be favorable
 or unfavorable." So the people lodged with him; and the man started in on the
 beginning of his performance and service and worship. God then desired to make
 a manifestation of His mysteries: now behold He could not do this Himself, nor
 could He do it through one who worshipped Him after the manner of anyone of the
 children of Israil, nor could He do it by writing, or by the agency of any of
 His angels, but forsooth only by sending unto him His very Command. And the
 companion of Bila'am upon beholding the spectre of the Command of God, fled
 away from it, and he became the visible form of the agent of the Creator who
 addressed Bila'am; for this was the device employed to communicate with him.
 And the Command of God said to him: "Did not I say unto thee, O Bila'am, when
 the people came unto thee; `go with them'?"; making inquiry to see what craving
 Bila'am had for the journey. But he answered him not a syllable, though his
 usual custom was to say: "Not so; for without my God I give ear to nothing."
 And he did not fully believe that he had heard the correct interpretation of
 the speech, until He commanded him to mount and ride, and then he was made to
 saddle his ass, and went along with the wise men of Mab. And the anger of the
 Creator was aroused, because of his starting out on the journey before he had
 sought instruction (of God), and he placed Himself in the way to make an attack
 upon him. Now he (Balaam) was riding upon his she-ass, and boasting of her
 before the people of learning, that he had no need of a guide when with her,
 and that he had no necessity ever to beat her. But when she espied the Agency
 of the Creator- Mighty and Glorious- standing in the way, with His drawn sword
 in His hand, she swerved aside out of the way through fear of Him; and this was
 the first of the putting to shame of Bila'am and of his remorse; and he beat
 her with his staff. And the Agency of the Creator removed to a place between
 walls in a field, and stood still; and when the ass behold Him, she shied into
 one of the walls and injured Bila'am's foot, and he beat her more violently.
 And when the learned and wise men beheld this, they said unto him: "O our
 master, it cannot be that there is a cause for her opposition to the execution
 of this mandate of the Divine Word?" And he answered and said unto them: "It
 was desired that this mandate should be carried out." And the Agency of God
 again passed on, until He stopped in a narrow place where there was no turning
 out either to the right or to the left; and when the ass beheld Him, she lay
 down under him (Balaam), and he again beat her violently. And God put speech on
 the tongue of the animal, and thereupon she said to Bila'am: "What have I done
 unto thee that thou shouldest beat me these three times? Am not I thine ass upon
 whom thou ridden since thou hast created up till now? Have I ever acted badly
 toward thee like as this time?" And he said: "No." Then God opened the eyes of
 Bila'am, so that he saw the Agency of God, even an angel standing in the way
 with His drawn sword in His hand, and he threw himself down before Him; and
 said unto him: "Why hast thou beaten thine ass three times? If thou hadst got
 right in front of me, I would have killed thee and saved he alive; for I have
 seen the wickedness of thy inclination. Now however, go along with the people,
 but keep carefully to what I shall say unto thee, and do not overstep it."
 Thereupon Bila'am journeyed on; and when the kings heard of his journeying,
 they came out to meet him, and they found him perplexed in his affair, and he
 informed them as to what had happened, and that in accordance with it he could
 not do anything except by the command of God- Mighty and Glorious. And the
 people took him to the cliff which is described in the holy Pentateuch, that he
 might behold all the children of Israil. Now after the man had been thus met
 and honored and made much of, his zeal was increased to obtain to the uttermost
 degree the love of the people. Thereupon he built on the cliff that has been
 described seven altars, and offered up on every altar a calf and a ram, and
 began to worshipping that he might hear what would be addressed unto him. And
 he heard what did not please him, and he announced what he had heard to the
 company of the kings; and they said to him: "Remove unto another place, and
 perhaps there the cursing of this place will be easier." And he obeyed them,
 and he did like he had done the first time, and he heard greater things than
 the first communication; and he began to go to the extreme in glorifying the
 children of Israil and honoring them. And the king of Mab said to him: "If thou
 dost not curse them, do not bless them." Then he besought them that he might
 remove unto another place, and he went and did as he had done the second time.
 And his eyes fell upon the desert and he saw the tribes of Israil, and divine
 spirits were guarding them, that is, the angels were protecting them every
 soul; and he turned away the evil eye from them, and hastened to glorify and
 bless them, until he said concerning them: "O Israil, cursed be he who curseth
 thee, and blessed be he who blesseth thee." And the anger of the king was
 aroused against him; but Bila'am said unto him; "Let not thine anger be aroused
 against me; did I not say unto thee that I could not act contrary to what I am commanded?
 But now assemble the kings with thee, that I may inform them your company of
 what will happen unto you and others besides you of the people, and I will give
 you information about a device, which, if carried out, will occasion their
 annihilation. Thereupon the kings assembled, and he made known unto them
 marvelous news, the explanation of which would be long; and he said to them:
 "Round about these people the holy angels keep guard, and the King of the
 heavens and the earth is with them, and it is not allowable to make use of
 sorcery against them, nor the science of astrology; nor will His heart
 repudiate them, except when they give themselves over to unbelief, or are led
 to do so by some stratagem, then the Creator will become angry with them and they
 will perish, and not a single one of them will survive."</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER IV.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF THE STRATAGEM AND ARTIFICE
 USED BY BILA'AM </p>
 
 <p>AGAINST THE CHILDREN OF ISRAIL</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   When the kings heard him relate what has
 preceded, they said to him: "How is the way to accomplish what thou hast
 mentioned concerning their destruction?" And he looked up the last resource of
 infidelity and pollution, and made it known unto them, and said to them:
 "Select of the most beautiful and fair women as many as ye can, and the king shall
 be the first to send forth his daughter with them; thereupon give unto each one
 of them an idol which she may worship, and an ornament which she may look at,
 and perfume which she may inhale, and food and drink; and the daughter of the
 king should be in a chariot which is wafted along with the wind, and it should
 be enjoined upon her that she make it her aim to go to the tabernacle, and pay
 her respects to no one except to their chief unto whom the crowd show
 deference, for he is their chief. And if in this she meets his approval, then
 she shall say unto him: " Wilt thou not receive me, or eat of my food and drink
 of my drink and offer sacrifices unto my god? For after this I will be thine,
 and with thee will do whatsoever thou desirest." For know, O king, that by the
 chief of this people being polluted, both he and his company will perish, and
 of them there will not remain a survivor." And the kings did what he
 recommended unto them; and there were collected to them twenty-four thousand
 girls, and they sent them away on the Sabbath day. And as they descended
 opposite the tabernacle, the chief of the tribe of Shim'aun (Simeon) rose up;
 for he was the chief of fifty-nine thousand men and was in the advance. And the
 daughter of the king advanced unto him, for she on beholding the great
 deference shown to him by his companions supposed him to be the prophet Musa-
 peace be upon him, and he ate of her food and drank of her drink and worshipped
 the idol which was in her hand, and after this she was submissive to him in his
 desire. Thereupon everyone of them- I mean this particular tribe- took one girl
 for himself; and the Creator became angry at the people, and destroyed of them
 in the wink of an eye four thousand men together with four thousand girls. And
 had not Finahas (Phinehas) the imam- peace be upon him- rushed from the
 presence of Musa the Prophet- peace be upon him- while he and his assembly were
 weeping at the door of the tabernacle, and seized in his hand a lance and
 bursting in upon them thrust through the man and girl- I mean the daughter of
 the king- and dispatched them, assuredly would the wrath of the Creator have
 destroyed the whole people; but by this action he removed and warded off the
 Divine anger from the children of Israil. And to Finahas- peace be upon him-
 there resulted from this noble fame and an excellent remembrance, and a
 covenant to the end of the ages. And praise be to God the Creator without
 cessation!</b></p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p>CHAPTER V.</p>
 
 <p>THE HISTORY OF MIDYAN.</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   When the stratagem of Bila'am against the children
 of Israil was accomplished and there had perished of them this great number,
 and they had been overtaken by this calamity, God revealed to the prophet Musa-
 peace be upon him- that he should take vengeance for the children of Israil
 upon the people of Midyan, before that he should return to his elements
 (meaning by this, before his decease). So he commanded Yush'a the son of Nun,
 at the time of his investing him with his successorship, that he should go
 forth with the company which he specially mentioned, and with him Finahas, the
 imam, for he had gained the victory and a name, and he it was who had averte3d
 the Divine anger, and not anyone else, for he had hastened to obey his Lord.
 Now Bila'am had returned unto the king of Mab to congratulate him over the
 calamity of the children of Israil, and he found the kings collected together
 and indulging in joy and merriment, and before they were aware, 12,000 men had
 surrounded their city, whereupon they made haste in sending out the harlots
 with ornaments and censers and perfumes, taking for granted that what they had
 made a successful beginning in would be carried out to a perfect completion.
 But they (<i>i.e.,</i> the Israelites) slaughtered these (the women) with the
 sword. Then Finahas- peace be upon him- with his cousin, went in advance and
 sounded with the trumpets, and the walls of the fortress fell down in ruins,
 and the army entered into Midyan, and they killed simultaneously the five kings
 and every man whom they found in it. And they began to make inquires about
 Bila'am, and they found him in a house of worship, and lo, he engaged in
 worship and was performing service. And they brought him out, and he was
 talking in speech that was unintelligible and could not be understood, because
 of the greatness of his confusion and bewilderment and the aberration of his
 mental faculties. And Yusha, the son of Nun, exerted himself to preserve him
 alive, that our master Musa- the peace of God be upon him- might behold him;
 but they of the tribe of Shima'un who beheld him were not obedient, nay, even,
 they cried out the Law against him, and put him to death. And Yusha said: "Who
 killed him? Why have ye done this, seeing we had taken him under our
 protection?" And they said unto him: " O our master, there should be no protection
 granted to an infidel, nor security to a sorcerer; had we not killed him, he
 might have effected the accomplishment of a stratagem against thee and against
 thy people. And we have dared to go contrary to thee in killing him, because of
 what was in our hearts concerning his deed, and if there be sin in our action
 in violating the protection accorded to him, lo, we assume it; but to our
 master belongs such exalted sentiments that he will look with liberality upon
 our excuse." And he approved of what they said and justified their action. And
 the people plundered Midyan, and drove away its cattle and took captive its
 women and children; and not a thing remained in it but they took it. And they
 returned laden with booty, victorious and safe; not a single man of them was
 missing. And our master Musa, the prophet- peace be upon him- with el-`Azar
 (Eleazar), the imam, the son of Harun (Aaron), and a crowd of chiefs went out
 to meet them. And when the beheld what there was among their number of captive
 women, our master Musa, the Prophet- upon him be the most excellent peace-
 became angry at them, and said to them: "This crowd has been the cause of your
 destruction." Thereupon he commanded them to kill every women who had known a
 man, and every boy child, and that none should remain except female children
 who had not known a man; and that they, together with the company that was with
 them, should separate themselves seven days for the purpose of purification.
 And they did so. And the number of the female captives who remained over after
 those who were killed, was thirty-two thousand girls; and of sheep there was
 675,000 head, and of cattle there was 72,000 head; and of horses and mules and
 camels, 61,000 head; and of gold and silver and vessels and general goods, such
 a quantity as is impossible to define and describe. But, more wonderful than
 this, was the unharmed condition of the 12,000 men who entered a province such
 as this was, without the loss of a single man of them, or even one of them
 being overtaken by the bow of a sword or hit with a stone. Blessed be God, the
 One who is able to do whatsoever He pleaseth, and of Him do I ask assistance,
 and unto Him do I put my trust, and unto Him do I return penitently.</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER VI</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT OUR MASTER MUSA, THE
 PROPHET- </p>
 
 <p>PEACE BE UPON HIM- EXPOUNDED, BEFORE HIS
 DEATH.</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   When God informed our master Musa, the
 Prophet, of the time when he could no longer remain alive, He commanded him to
 go up unto the mountain known as Nabah (Nebo). And he (Moses) proceeded to give
 instructions to Yusha, the son of Nun, and to the children of his brother, and
 to the assembly of the leaders, with regard to all necessary matters. And they
 remained with him some time, along will all the officers of the army and the
 people of wisdom; and he put them under a covenant that they would go with the
 children of Israil in the way which he had commanded them, and not swerve from
 it either to the right or to the left; and he ordered the priests to sound upon
 the trumpets, and send forth heralds who should proclaim throughout the
 congregation of the children of Israil: "Whoever desires to see our master Musa
 the Prophet- the most excellent, peace be upon him- let him come, that he may
 hear his blessing and whatever he shall reveal, and look upon him and bid him
 farewell, before he goes to the place which God has chosen for him." Thereafter
 he entered into the tabernacle and offered on the brazen altar the sacrifices,
 and lifted up the veil, even the veil of the holy house, and cast incense upon
 the golden altar, and worshipped his Lord; and then he bid farewell to the
 temple and what there was in it of omnipotence and divine majesty, and went
 out. And all the children of Israil according to their ranks were gathered
 together unto him, and he sat down upon an exalted seat, as was his custom,
 whereon he was elevated above the people and the light of his countenance shone
 as the rays of the sun. And he began to deliver an address unto the
 congregation of the children of Israil, in which he gathered together just as
 many as a servant of God could, of passages of praise to God, whose names are
 holy: and in it he expounded intelligence of the Divine favor which were to
 come, and the cause of Wrath and Error. And he informed the children of Israil
 concerning the deluge of fire, and the day of vengeance and reward, and defined
 the time of his return unto them. Then he announced unto them what should
 happen unto every tribe, and that would marshal them complete in the days of
 final perfection and completion. And he blessed them altogether, and they
 listened unto him. And, when the time came to bid farewell to each individual
 army, they began to cry aloud and wail and weep; and after a space of time he
 commanded them to be quiet and to sit down. Then he departed, walking slowly up
 the ascent of the mountain unto which God had ordered him to ascend, and with
 him were Yusha, the son of Nun, and el'Azar the imam, and the assembly of the
 leaders who were bidding him farewell and weeping at the approach of his separation
 from them and clinging to him. And when the farewells were prolonged with them,
 and night drew near, a pillar of divine fire descended and separated between
 them and their master- peace be upon him- and no one knows what happened to him
 after this, even unto this time. His allotted period of life had reached its
 limit, and the term of his existence among men- peace be unto him- and now his
 dealings were directly with his Lord and His angels. And of God do we beg that
 He would unite us to him through His mercy. Behold He is over all things
 powerful, and He is my sufficiency and illustrious Protector.</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER VII.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT YUSH'A, HIS DISCIPLE,
 SAID, </p>
 
 <p>AFTER THE DISAPPEARANCE OF HIS LORD AND
 MASTER.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   When the master Musa, the Prophet- peace be
 upon him- disappeared from him and from the congregation of the children of
 Israil, and the </b><b>COMMAND separated him
 from them, which event he was unable to avert from himself, and there passed
 away from them the sight of him, and when all had completely despaired of his
 return, Yush'a, the son of Nun, wept for him and proclaimed with his loudest
 voice, saying: "O Master! The death of every one of the children of Adam, from
 the first to last, was witnessed, and his grave seen; but thou! Who has seen thy
 grave? What prophet of the prophet can attain unto thy glory, or prolong his
 memory unto the extent thy memory is prolonged? Where is one who has brought to
 life the dead and caused the living to die, through the permission of his Lord,
 besides thee? Unto what prophet do the infidels bear testimony as to his
 prophetic office, except thee? What prophet, in the ages past or yet to come,
 did cause his congregation to hear the voice of the Creator from the regions of
 the heavens, except thee? Where is one who shall arise, and his words ascend on
 high and ward off the Divine anger, and bring down Divine mercy, except thee?
 What prophet fasted before his Lord, until he fasted one hundred and twenty
 days including the nights, except thee? What prophet boasted of his being the
 one who held converse with God without anything intervening between them,
 except thee? Where is one, who has trodden the fire, and cleft the darkness,
 and rent the clouds, and reached unto the curtain of omnipotence, besides thee?
 What book ascribed to any prophet has it the teaching of the worship of the
 Creator, and of how access may be had to Him, except they book? O one who
 killed the Nil (Nile) with his rod! O one who did reveal new things! O one who
 showed forth wonders! O one who manifested signs! O one who light up the
 darkness! O one who cleft the sea with his rod! O one-who put to rout armies
 with his hand! O one who warded off the Divine anger by his petitions! O one
 who brought down Divine mercy by his intercessions! O one whose very sustenance
 was the worship of his Lord! O one who went out from the boundaries of humanity
 and human power into the Divine power! O one who understood the past and knew
 what was to come! O one who ruled his enemies by his invocation! O my master
 and my lord! How can I exist and how can they people exist, now that thou art
 gone? After this his weeping increased as did also the weeping of the
 congregation that was with him, and when the grief and wailing had been long
 indulged in, with submission and humility, it was announced to Yush'a, the son
 of Nun, saying: "Return thou and those that are with thee of the army, and do
 not oppose the command of God"-May His name be glorious.</b></p>

 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   When Yush'a, and the priests returned after
 bidding farewell to the prophet- peace be upon him,- the congregation of the
 children of Israil met them, and they commenced weeping for their master, yea,
 every company by company, and they continued weeping for him thirty days and
 nights. And the nations heard their clamor and wailing and crying, and they
 assembled together in confederation on the borders and rejoiced exceedingly
 when they were informed of the death of the prophet- peace be upon him, -and
 they resolved to encounter the children of Israil. But when God- Powerful and
 Mighty- perceived the conspiracy of the Canaanites, of those who were assembled
 unto them, He made a manifestation of Divine power and revealed unto Yusha, the
 son of Nun, that he should strengthen his own and the people's courage, by
 saying unto them: "That as He had been with them in the past, so would He be
 with them in the future so long as they continued in worshipful submission."
 Praise he unto Him to Whom belongs the kingdom and the majesty and the power
 and eternal existence. There is no God but He, and no kingdom but His kingdom.</b></p>

 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   After the death of Musa, Kalimu'l-lah, God
 made a revelation unto Yush'a, the son of Nun, the disciple of Musa, the
 servant of God, saying unto him: "O Yush'a, arise, start out, and with thy
 people pass over the Urdun (Jordan) unto the land which I am about to give unto
 the children of Israil; all the places which your feet shall tread shall belong
 to you. Your boundary shall be from the wilderness to el-Ludnan (Lebanon), and
 from the river el-Farah (Euphrates) unto the uttermost sea; and no enemy shall
 stand before you. O Yush'a, do not abolish the reading of what Musa the prophet
 inscribed and wrote, with what is intrusted unto the Liwanites (Levites) in the
 place in the holy house, and learn from it night and day, even all the days of
 thy life, that thou mayest be instructed; for if thou observest the same and
 dost not swerve from what is commanded thee to the right or to the left, thou
 wilt succeed and prosper, and thy enemies will be put to rout by thee, and thou
 shalt tread upon their necks." And at this time the communication ended.</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER X.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF YUSH'A ASSEMBLING THE
 CHILDREN OF ISRAIL,</p>
 
 <p>AND HIS RENEWING THE COVENANT WITH THEM</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   After Yush'a, had heard what God had
 revealed unto him, he joined unto himself el-Azar, the imam- peace be upon him-
 and he sat down upon his sacred chair, while Yush'a sat upon his royal chair.
 And there gathered unto them, the holy priests, and the Liwanites who offered
 the sacrifices, and the twelve chiefs who always attended them, and the chief
 judges, and the seventy chosen wise men, and the officers over the thousands,
 and hundreds, and fifties, and tens. And with the assembling of this congress,
 the trumpets sounded and the heralds went forth proclaiming a general
 assembling of the children of Israil. And it was not but an hour before there
 were gathered unto them the old men and the young, with many of the women and
 children and all the army. And then Yush'a, began to enumerate to them the
 things that God-Powerful and Mighty- had manifested by the hand of our master Musa
 the Prophet- peace be upon him- in their behalf and that of their predecessors.
 Next he recalled to them wherein they had acted contrary to Him, and tried Him,
 and rebelled against Him. And he said unto them: "O assembled men, I am going
 to bind you to the covenant and compact which existed before the death of the
 Prophet- peace be upon him- that you will not associate others with God, and
 that you will see to the promulgation of the laws upon which this covenant is
 founded, and it is, namely, the explanation of the law, and the explanation of
 what the obedient will receive and what shall befall the disobedient. And now
 this covenant in which I do confirm you is not with you and you alone, but
 includes you and those whom ye shall beget unto the end of the ages." And he
 told them what the other nations were wedded to, concerning the worship of
 idols; and informed them that God was with them as long as they remained in
 obedience, but that He would remove His favor from them upon their acting
 disobediently, and that then their ways would not prosper, nor would there be a
 united nation. Then he proclaimed in his loudest voice: "Assembled men, let
 there not be among you a disseminator of corrupt designs, spikes of corn and
 wormwood, (meaning by this, one who associates others with God and unites the
 worship of others with His worship); nor let there be among you one who
 cogitates in his heart wicked doctrines, or opposition to the command of God-
 Powerful and Mighty- lest there be a destruction of his mighty, holy nation and
 all its greatness, and separation from the Creator-may His name be holy- and
 your enemies attain unto their desires and plunder you of your cattle, and
 wives, and children. For whoever adopts these views, or any part of them, there
 shall fall upon him all the calamities which were written in the Holy Law, and
 God will blot out the remembrance of him under heaven, and will make him
 distinguished by reason of his calamities, apart from all the tribes of Israil.
 And so, be sincere with your souls and your conscience, that I may renew the
 covenant with you in accordance with what you may say; and God and His heavens
 and His earth, and His angels, shall bear witness against you in what happens
 between us and you; may the sentence be in your favor and not against you. And
 now if ye continue in keeping what has been commanded you, God- may He be
 blessed and exalted- will bless you and keep you and protect you and lead you
 to victory and will subdue your enemies and give the land, concerning which He
 swore, by His own omnipotence, unto your ancestors, Ibrahim, and Ishaq (Isaac)
 and Yaqub (Jacob)- peace be upon them. And He will keep you, and will keep the
 land in all happiness, and He will remove calamities and all disasters, and
 multiply you; but when ye shall have been disobedient and rebellious, the
 Divine favor will be removed from you; and the Divine power from your side, and
 from your support, and the angels will be removed from your side, and the name
 of the greatest King depart from giving you assistance, and there shall fall
 upon you those things which are written in the book of Wrath and Curse, and He
 will scatter your troops, and forget your affairs and the enemies will take
 possession of you, and there will remain no longer to you a king, or shrine, or
 possessions, or men, and God will disperse you throughout the regions of the
 earth from one extremity of it to the other, and He will make you servants and
 subjects. So now, whatever ye say and believe and covenant, let it be the real
 covenant binding upon you, and let this second covenant be added unto that
 which He covenanted with you through our master Musa the Prophet- peace be upon
 him. Therefore act sincere from your souls, and the secret thoughts of your
 hearts.</b></p>

 <p>AND THE COVENANT THAT THEY ENTERED INTO AT
 THAT TIME.</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   The congregation of the children of Israil
 answered him, while crying out, weeping and humbling themselves before God, and
 casting their souls into His hands, saying: "O our master and our lord, we hear
 and will obey the command of God- Mighty and Powerful- and of His true and
 faithful Prophet, and also thy command, O king, and the command of our imam and
 our rulers, and there will be no opposition to what ye order, and no deviation
 from what ye say either to the right or to the left, nor from whatever our
 master Musa, the Prophet- peace be upon him- has ordained, and there shall be
 no rejection of a single part of it; and whoever shall rebel and deviate, and
 act treacherously, let upon him be the Curse and Wrath, for after this manner
 did our master Musa, the Prophet- peace be upon him- agree with us and impose
 conditions upon us, and put us under oath, and covenant with us, and offer up
 for us the sacrifices, and we answered him as we have answered you. And God is
 the witness over us in this, and He is our sufficiency and bountiful
 Protector."</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER XII.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT YUSH'A, THE SON OF NUN,
 DID IN </p>
 
 <p>ORGANIZING THE ARMY, AND THE MEMBERS
 THEREOF.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   When Yush'a, beheld the zeal of the people
 he said, "The One who has insight into you and your purposes is God." And he
 renewed with them the covenant and compact, and offered for them the offerings,
 and the imam blessed them. Thereupon he and the imam, each of them, sat down on
 his throne; and he summoned the leaders, and demanded of them that they should
 make out a census of the children of Israil, tribe by tribe, and that the
 enumeration throughout the congregation, should embrace all men from the age of
 twenty years up to the age of fifty years, excepting the tribe of Lawi (Levi).
 And he ordered that this tribe should be enumerated, from the boy of a month
 old upwards: for so had our master Musa, the Prophet- peace be upon him- given
 orders before his death. But such as were under age twenty of age and over
 fifty years of age were not to be included in the enumeration. And the leaders
 made out the census, and the whole amounted to 601,730 men, although of this
 number the tribe of Rawban (Reuben), and the tribe of Gad, and the half tribe
 of Manashshah (Manasseh), had their landed possessions behind the Urdun
 (Jordan), even nine cities with their districts, which had belonged to Sihun
 and `Ug, the sons of Anaq; three cities and their provinces had been conquered
 by Nabih and his cousin of the tribe of Manashshah. For it did come to pass
 that, when our master Musa, the Prophet- peace be upon him- conquered these
 cities and destroyed their inhabitants, that there gathered unto him the
 leaders of these two tribes and a half, and they said unto him: "O our master
 and our lord, these cities suit us, for we have many animals and cattle, even
 though they be approximately less than one sixth of the assigned lands, while
 the whole number of the census of our men comes close on to one fifth of the
 army of the children of Israil." And he rebuked them, supposing that they
 preferred settling apart from their brethren. But they answered: "Behold we
 will leave our luggage and our cattle in these cities, and we will march
 forward under one enrolment, thrusting aside every pretext, and we will not
 return to our assigned lands until our brethren have got possession of all
 their assigned lands, and after that we will return unto our assigned lands and
 to our own places." And our master Musa, the Prophet- the most excellent, peace
 be upon him- answered them favorably, in reply to what they had asked of him,
 and assigned to them while he was alive this region. And the first of those
 whom Yush'a, the son of Nun, enrolled in his army, were the two and a half tribes,
 and the whole number of their enrolment was 110,580 men; and-according to these
 figures- the chiefs apportioned out the land from the Urdun to the sea. And
 this is the enrolment, based on the census, of the prosperous, victorious,
 holy, triumphant and blessed army. And the census of the tribe of Lawi was
 apart from the company of which mention has been made before; for the members
 of this tribe did not engage in the wars, nor did they separate from the
 service of their Lord; and the whole of their census, from a boy one month old
 and upwards, was 23,000 men. And when the leaders came with the enrolment of
 the census, Yush'a the son of Nun made them appear before him, and he announced
 good tidings unto them, namely, that God would bless them so as that there
 would result from one, a thousand as our master Musa the Prophet- peace be upon
 him- promised them from God- may His name be blessed.</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER
 XIII.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF THE SPIES WHOM YUSHA, </p>
 
 <p>THE KING SENT FORTH.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   When Yush'a, the son of Nun, heard about
 the mustering of the Kanaanites, and the assembling of the giants, he sent out
 spies from the men of experience, intelligence, prudence and piety, to see the
 army of the enemies and make an investigation, and to proceed to Yar'ha
 (Jericho) and make an investigation as to the number of its men, and of those
 who were collected unto them, and then returning make it known to him. So the
 spies bid the army farewell, and invoked God's favor, and started out on their
 journey, having changed their outward appearance to the condition of ones who
 had come from far distant places. Now the spies knew all the languages spoken
 in the army of the enemies. And when they arrived at it they began to weep, and
 the enemy asked them, what news they had, and they said, "We are men from the
 people of the east, our companions have heard tidings of this great nation,
 which was for forty years in the wilderness without a guide or provisions, and
 the report reached our company that they have a Lord whom they speak of as `The
 King of the heavens and earth,' and that He has appropriated unto them both our
 country and your country, and so our companions have sent us out, that we may
 find out the truth of what has been reported unto us, and make it known to
 them. And we have journeyed and already passed by you a long time ago, while ye
 were busily engrossed in your occupations, and we did come to the army of that
 nation and found them perplexed, wandering round and round in the wilderness,
 and the secret among them was, that their God had become angry at them, and
 would not bring any of them into the land except two men; so we have returned
 with this good news, gladdened and rejoicing.</b></p>
 
 <p><b>   Now when it was so at this time that, we
 know what this nation had done with Sihun and `Ug, and with their lands and
 territories, and also what they did with the kings of Midyan and Mab, and the
 talking of their women and children and that this nation was bent upon entering
 your country and then our country, we made haste that we might make known to our
 companions the truth of this. And we journeyed unto them from the mountains,
 and we had but just reached the vicinity of the camps, when there came forth
 unto us three or four men, and each of them took hold of one of us, and fetched
 us into the presence of the new king, who had been invested with the kingdom as
 successor to Musa the Prophet- the best of peace be upon him. Now his companion
 was merciful who lifted not up his glance to any one; but this one was as a
 giant man, whose conversation broke souls, and whose speech split hearts, and
 whose reproach struck astonishment into minds. And we had but just stood in his
 presence when he knew our name and our origin and our country, and when we
 started out, and the places at which we had encamped, and in all that he
 mentioned unto us he was correct. And we at once believed in him and his Lord,
 through fear of him, but he answered us, that: This faith is not a faith to be
 accepted, when ye do so through fear; yet there is no fear for you; go, return
 and say to all whom ye meet and to your companions: Look out for your own
 welfare, and whoever flees away is safe, but whoever remains shall perish. For
 after the space of a week, the water of the Urdun will stand still for me by
 the command of our Lord- the Highest- until His people shall cross over; and
 not a fortress shall be shut in their faces, when they shall have gone around
 it seven circuits, for its walls will fall, and all they who remain, who are
 found inside, will perish: and the city and territory will be our territory,
 and the assigned lands shall become ours, assigned unto us by the King of the
 heavens and earth; whose creatures and servants all kings are. And this is the
 whole of what we heard from him, and we know that his name is Yush'a, the son
 of Nun, and that he is the one who put to route the Amlaq (the Amalekites), and
 is the slayer of Sihun and the destroyer of `Ug, and the one who ruined the
 kings of Midyan and Mab. O woe to us and woe to you, and whatever is attached
 unto our country and your country; for they are a people who have no pity, nor
 do they leave survivors or show compassion, nor do they make a truce, except
 with those who are outside of us and you, for we stand, in their estimation, in
 the character of infidels and profligates and as a haughty and rebellious
 people; and the one who is lucky among us and among you is he who takes his own
 people between his hands and flees away with all speed, until he shall have got
 out beyond all their assigned lands, ere he feels regret where regret will
 profit him nothing." And the men rode on and pursed their journey, and after
 this manner did they speak with all whom they met until they returned to Yariha
 (Jericho), and here it became known about them, and they were sought after to
 be destroyed, and they begged protection of a woman who was called Rehab the
 innkeeper, whose house was beside the walls of the city, and she took them out
 and concealed them, and gave excuse unto those who sought them, saying, that
 they had already returned. Then she made a covenant with them and they with
 her, that, if God- Mighty and Powerful- should vanquish for them this city,
 they would spare her, and spare whatever souls were in her courtyard, of her
 own people. And the spies enjoined upon her to fix upon the roof of her house a
 sign which they should know, so that when she knew they were drawing nigh unto
 the city, she should display it; but they stipulated with her, that they would
 be innocent of the blood of all such as were found, of her own people, outside
 of the courtyard. And she brought them out, by night, and God willed their safe
 escape, and they returned to the army. And they told the king and the imam and
 their congregation, what they had witnesses and what had happened, what they
 witnessed and what had happened to them, and what favor the woman had done in
 their behalf. And the congregation answered them that they would spare the
 woman, in accordance with what they had covenanted with her. And the report of
 her spread abroad throughout the army, and the whole congregation of them knew
 her. </b></p>

 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF THE SUMMONING OF THE
 CHILDREN OF ISRAIL</p>
 
 <p>TO UNDERTAKE THE JOURNEY.</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   When Yush'a, the king, heard the statement
 of the spies, he sent forth the leaders, to proclaim throughout the army that
 they should proceed in the journey, having with them provisions for three days,
 and also to say in the proclamation: "O assemblies of men? Fear not, nor be
 dismayed, for God, your God, is about to journey with you, that He may show
 forth with you a miracle at this time, to make you successful over your
 enemies; and as to the miracle which God will show forth with you at the Urdun,
 the like of it has not been heard of in the ages past, now shall the like of it
 be heard of in the ages yet to come. And it is the first terror of you that
 shall fall upon the hearts of your enemies. Therefore, know, that the holy
 priests shall carry the golden ark, which is the ark of the covenant, which
 covenant is celestial substance, for it is the tablets whose writings was of
 Divine light: lo they are celestial substance; and when the priests with the
 ark shall enter the water of the Urdun, the water will stand still, and subside
 by the power of the ALMIGHTY, until that the water below flows away, while the
 water above shall mount up and increase upon itself, until all the children of
 Israil, and those who are in their company, shall pass over in absolute
 dryness."</b></p>
 
 <p><b>   The Yush'a, the son of Nun, himself called
 out and said: "O assemblies of men! God commands you that there should be
 between you and the priests who carry the ark an extent of equal space to two
 thousand yards, so do not approach unto it within this distance, that God may
 complete His work with you." The he ordered the twelve chiefs to take from
 under the feet of the priests, twelve stones, after that the children of Israil
 had finished the passage over the Urdun, and that each one of them should write
 his name upon his stone, in order that what had happened might be preserved and
 perpetuated through the eternity of the ages to come, even the miracle which
 God- may His name be glorious- would show on the Urdun. And the Liwanites
 (Levites) proclaimed with loudest voice: "Praise be to God of Gods, and Lord of
 Lords, to Whose commandments, animate and inanimate things are obedient, and
 the heavens and the earth and the seas and the rivers and all that therein is.
 There is no God but He, and no kingdom lasts but His kingdom, nor any power but
 His power, nor any sovereign except under His sovereignty. Perish whoever deny
 Him and believe in another than He, for He is the God.</b></p>

 commanded them. And the cloud was lifted up, on the first (day) of the first
 month, of the first year of the first period of seven years of the Jubil
 (Jubilee) even from the beginning of the entering in of the children of Israil
 within the boundaries of the assigned lands. And up to this time there had
 elapsed, of the days of the world as established by the law, two thousand,
 seven hundred and ninety-four complete years, and this reckoning of time is
 correct, which the learned know by chronological computations based on the era
 of the flood. And the priests proceeded forward when the cloud was lifted up,
 and attained to the distance from the army which he prescribed unto them. And
 when the priests with the ark approached the water of the Urdun, the Liwanites
 shouted aloud, and the congregation of the children of Israil joined in with
 them, saying with one voice; "There is no power or strength in the presence of
 Thy power, O Lord of worlds!" And the water stood still, and rose up in
 accumulation, by the power of its Creator; He who is almighty over whatever He
 wills, the Worker of miracles and wonders. And continued to be heaped up, wave
 upon wave, until it became like unto huge mountains, while the priests stood
 praising God, and shouting halleluiahs and saying: "Praise be unto Him, in
 obedience to whom every thing exists." And they stood, with the ark, on the dry
 ground in the midst of the Urdun, until all the children of Israil, with their
 large throng, and their cattle, had passed over on the dry ground through the
 midst of the Urdun, on its bottom, and it was dry like as in the days of
 harvest. And the Liwanites were praising and shouting halleluiahs, and saying:
 "Praise be unto Him in obedience to whom every thing exists. Praise be unto Him
 by whose will this is come to pass." And when the people came out of the Urdun
 they observed the commandment, and took the twelve stones from under the feet
 of the priests, and each man wrote his name upon his stone, and the king also
 took a similar stone. And when the priests with the ark came up out, the waters
 rushed down with great tumult, and winds blew violently with the rushing down
 of the waters. And the nations heard about this great miracle, and their hearts
 were broken up, and their confederated troops were scattered. And the water of
 the Urdun destroyed, at that time, many places which were near it, by reason of
 the great violence of the wind which accompanied it. And God does whatever He
 wishes- Glorious be His name. And of Him do I ask assistance, and upon Him do I
 put my trust, and unto Him be the praise for what He has bestowed.</b></p>

 <p>AN ACCOUNT OF THE HYMN OF PRAISE, WHICH</p>
 
 <p>YUSHA THE KING OFFERED UP.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   Then Yush'a, the son of Nun, and the
 children of Israil offered up the hymn of praise, which our master Musa the
 Prophet- peace be upon him- offered up at the sea of el-Qulzum, and they added
 thereunto praises and halleluiahs, and rendered praise and thanksgiving for
 what God had generously bestowed upon them. And among the number of the hymns
 of praise which they offered up, they said: "Who is like unto Thee, O Thou who
 art perfect in holiness! O Thou who dost inspire terror! O Thou who dost reveal
 secret things! O Thou who dost perform new things! O Thou worker of miracles! O
 Thou displayer of wonders! How, O our Lord, shall we address Thee? O Thou
 revealer of signs! O Thou who makest light the darkness! Who is like unto Thee?
 There is no likeness like unto thy likeness, for Thou art the origin of actions
 and likenesses and bodies, and forms, and shapes, and spiritual things, which
 are endowed with the attributes of Thy nature." On that day Yush'a, the son of
 Nun, was magnified in honor among the children of Israil, and they feared him
 as they had feared Musa the Prophet- peace be upon him- and they knew that God
 was with him. And Yush'a, the son of Nun, set up twelve stones as a monument,
 rising up in the Urdun. And the chiefs erected the twelve stones in a place
 called Jalil (Gilgal), that the generations to come might behold them, and
 remember the drying up of the Urdun, and so praise to Doer of miracles; and that
 fathers might tell sons of this deed, and that kings and nations might hear
 that our God is the one conquering God. And when the kings of esh-Sham (Syria)
 heard of the children of Israil's crossing over into the land appointed unto
 them, and about the stoppage of the water of the Urdun, and its drying up, they
 arrayed themselves in funeral robes, and were smitten with fear, and some of
 them died through fear of the children of Israil, on account of the greatness
 of the awe which they inspired. And God made a revelation to Yush'a, the son of
 Nun, saying: "To-day have I spread awe of you and your people over these
 nations, and I have lifted off from thee, and from thy people, every impurity
 and infirmity." And Yush'a named the place Jalil, and it is its name unto the
 end of the ages. And praise be unto God, the One who endureth without
 cessation.</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER
 XVII.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF ANCIENT YARIHA (JERICHO), </p>
 
 <p>AT THE TIME OF ITS CONQUEST.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   Upon the departure of the king from the
 place which he had named Jalil, they encamped in the district of Yariha, on the
 first day (of the feast of unleavened bread), the fourteenth day (of the first
 month). And they kept the Passover at this time, and ate unleavened bread from
 the new crops. And the manna ceased with their entrance into the land, and
 their eating of its crops, and of the fruit of its trees. And when the army had
 drawn near round about the city, Yush'a the son of Nun, retired apart from the
 camps, that he might worship his Lord by night, and when he had finished his
 devotions, he lifted up his eyes, and behold, the figure of a man standing,
 with his sword drawn in his hand, and he called out to him: "Yush'a!" Thereupon
 he (Joshua) replied: "Art thou of us, or of our adversaries?" And he answered
 him, and said: "I am the messengers of God, who rule over punishments." And he
 (Joshua) cast himself before him on the ground, because of his majesty. Then he
 rose up and said to him: "Lay upon thy servant the command which has been
 brought unto him." And he said unto him: "King, take off thy shoes from off
 they feet; for the place whereon thou standest is a holy place. God- Powerful
 and Mighty- says unto thee; O Yush'a, look before thee, behold I am about to
 place in thy hand this disobedient city, even Yariha, with its king and its
 people; now therefore choose for thyself, from among every tribe a thousand
 men. And they shall go round about the city, six circuits in six days, with the
 golden ark, the ark of the covenant, before them; and they shall not talk in
 conversation, or be intent upon anything except offering up praises and
 halleluiahs, nor shall they make an intermission in this, or raise any great
 tumult during the space of six days; yet the two priests shall be along with
 the two clamorous trumpets. But on the seventh day they shall go round about
 the city the seventh time, and the two priests shall sound with the two
 trumpets, and when the company hear the sound of the trumpets: then let them
 shout with a loud voice, three times, saying: `God is omnipotent in battles.
 God is His name.' And at the completion of this act, the wall of the city will
 be demolished, and the fortresses will fall down before the people, and the
 army shall enter the city and destroy it." And Yush'a returned and assembled
 the leaders of his people, and commanded that they should select twelve
 thousand men. And when they came unto him, he gave orders to them to march, and
 with them should be the sintly priests, bearing the ark and two trumpets. And
 he gave instructions unto the company, that they should offer up halleluiahs
 and praises, during the six days, in a low tone of voice; but on the seventh
 day they should round about the city six times, "And on the seventh time around
 the priests shall sound the trumpets, and upon their hearing the trumpets, the
 whole army shall shout with a loud voice, and instantly advance: and then the
 fortifications will be demolished, and God will put the city in your hands. And
 when this has been successfully accomplished by you, and ye have attained the
 city, ye shall put to death every breathing thing which ye find in it, whether
 of men or animals. And ye shall destroy it and burn it, and shall not leave in
 it any, except the woman who is known as Rahab the innkeeper; her ye shall
 spare, and also those souls that are in her courtyard, according as the spies
 made covenant with her. O assemblies of Men! Be watchful of yourselves; do not
 take anything from the city; burn its gold and silver and brass and iron, and
 all its appurtenances, and do not meddle with anything that is devoted; for
 then would ye and the army perish." And the people did as he instructed them.
 And on the seventh circuit the priests sounded with the two trumpets, and they
 cried out with a great shout; and at that, the walls of the city fell down, and
 the army entered in, and put to death every breathing thing in it from man even
 to animals. And they collected all the furniture which was in it, and placed it
 in the middle of the city, and burned it, and it became a mound never to be
 rebuilt. And Yush'a proclaimed in the loudest voice; " O assemblies of men! It
 is forbidden unto you, and unto those who shall rise up of your seed, to build
 up in this city one single stone." And it is the first of the rebellious
 cities, known as Ancient Yariha; and this city was devoted, destroyed, burned
 and converted into a mound, never to be built up or restored, throughout
 eternal ages. And this was done after the spies had entered the courtyard of
 the woman, and brought out her and every soul that was in her courtyard, and
 preserved them from death. And the name of Yush'a, by this act of his, was
 spread abroad unto the different regions of the earth. And a man of the
 children of Israil committed a trespass, and entered into the temple of the
 idols of this city, and he found therein a goodly thing of gold, and tongue of
 gold, their weight was two thousand, two hundred and fifty mithqals, and he
 took them and concealed them in his tent; now it had been forbidden him to even
 touch it, not to mention his taking it in theft, and hiding it in his place of
 abode. And the Lord became angry with the children of Israil, on account of
 him. And neither the leaders nor the king knew about this deed. But praise be
 unto Him who knows secrets, and who shows forth miracles. Blessed be His name,
 and exalted be His fame.</b></p>

 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE ONE</p>
 
 <p>WHO TOOK THE DEVOTED THING.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   When it was morning of the day of which
 mention has already been made, Yush'a the king, and all the army, came before
 the temple, and he made chiefs present themselves before el'Azar, the imam-
 peace be upon him,- and upon him were the jewels. And the jewel which was
 inscribed with the name of Yahudah (Judah) grew black; and he, in succession,
 presented the tribe of Yahudah, in its companies, name by name, before the
 jewel; and it grew black at the family of Zarah (Zerah), the son of Yahudah,
 And the man at once presented himself and stood before Yush'a the king. And the
 king said unto him: "O man! Lift up thy face to the King of the heavens and
 earth, and know that He knows secrets, and, O, woe be to the one who imagines
 that he can conceal from Him anything, or cover up from Him a matter. So now
 confess as to how you have sinned, and what you have taken of the devoted
 thing; for God has become angry with His people on your account." And the man
 answered him, and said: "I know, O king, that I have committed a great sin
 before God, Who knows what is secret and concealed, and I have been a traitor
 to the covenant of God, and of His messenger; for I entered the temple of the
 chief idol of Yariha, and there found a goodly thing of gold, and tongue of
 gold, and their weight was two thousand and fifty mithqals, and my soul became
 greedy for this, and I took it and buried it in my tent. And now if a crime
 like mine can be pardoned, well and good, seeing that God is merciful and
 compassionate; but if there is no pardon for it, then let there be executed
 what thou shalt command in my affair." Then the king sent immediately
 trustworthy people, and they brought what the man had mentioned he had felt
 greedy after, and so had taken it. And the governor and his associates, the
 chiefs, brought him before the temple of the creator, and command was given
 that he should be burned outside the camp. And he took the man and burned both
 him and whatever children he had, and cattle, and all that he possessed, and he
 placed all in a deep valley, and commanded the whole army to stone it with
 stones. And he named the valley: The valley of `Akur (Achor). And after this God
 removed His anger from the children of Israil; for what they did appeased Him.
 And unto Him be praise; for His bounty and the excellency of His favor and
 goodness. </b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER XIX.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF HOW CERTAIN PEOPLES OF THE
 KANAANITES</p>
 
 <p>PRACTICED A STRATAGEM, AND OBTAINED
 PROTECTION OF THE KING.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   After the capture of the city, the king and
 his people returned unto the place which was named Jalil.  And they took no notice until there came
 unto them a company of men, whose faces were blackened, and their garments and
 shoes worn out, and with them was bread that had become putrid. And they
 approached unto the king and unto the chiefs of the children of Israil, in this
 place, and saluted them, as the like of them were wont to salute, and they
 prostrated themselves before the assembly; then they said to the king: "We seek
 protection of thee and of thy people, that we may exist in your company; for we
 are of those who choose for ourselves, God your Lord." And he answered them:
 "Verily I will not grant protection unto you, unless ye inform me who ye are
 and from what place ye come." And they answered him: "We are people from a far
 distance, we have heard of your fame, and what signs and wonders God- Powerful
 and Mighty- has revealed to the children of Israil, even in the sea, and in the
 desert, and in Wady el-Mujib, and what has happened unto the kings through you.
 And now, O king, we have repaired unto thee that we might be in the company of
 those who beg protection with thee; for we believe in thy Lord, and we will not
 resist whatever thou shalt prescribe unto us, be it small or great. And behold
 thou seest our blackened faces, and our worn-out clothes, and our dried-out
 food; for we did not start out from our places, to come here in garments of old
 clothes, but this is the necessary result after the long journey. And now trust
 us with protection, that we may exist in the company of this great, blessed,
 holy people." And Yush'a bid some of his people advance unto them, and he
 entered into a covenant with them, and swore unto them by the God of Israil,
 that they would not kill them, nor those who were members of their company. And
 when it was after three days, the king found out that, that they were of his
 enemies, from three towns near him, on the south of the blessed mountain, and
 they were: Jaba'un (Gibeon) and Qiryah (Kirjath-jearim), and Birut (Beeroth).
 And no one of the army was able to go to this place, because of the protection
 granted, and the oath, and covenant. Thereupon the king summoned the men, and
 said unto them; "Why did ye conceal from em, and say that ye were from a
 distance, while ye were neighbors?" And they answered him, and said: "We knew
 that the God of the children of Israil, had commanded you to destroy these
 places, and not to spare the sword in any place in which a soul was, and we
 feared for ourselves, and did what we did; and now we are in thy hands, O king,
 do with us whatever you decide upon." And he set them at liberty, and make
 proclamation throughout the children of Israil, saying: "Do not kill them; but
 they shall become among the class of those cutting wood and drawing water for
 the beasts." And they did this with them, according to what he commanded.<br>

 <p>CHAPTER XX.</p>
 
 <p>AN ACCOUNT OF THE KANAANITES, WHOSE </p>
 
 <p>TERRITORIES THE LAND WAS.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   Some of the Kana'anites, when they heard of
 the children of Israil's passing over the Urdun, had fled to one people and
 another; but when they had been informed of what had befallen Yariha and its
 people, all those who were dwelling around Urdun, and the great sea, gathered
 themselves together, and entered into an agreement, and made preparation to
 meet the children of Israil, and join in battle with them. And the sent five of
 their chiefs, with the majority of the army with them; and they were bidden to
 advance and make an attack upon the three towns which had sued for themselves
 protection with the children of Israil. And they began with Jaba'un and put its
 people to great straits. And the inhabitants of Jaba'un sent unto Yush'a, the
 king, to inform him of the truth concerning the intentions of the kings, and
 that they had already commenced by destroying them, and that they were now in a
 state of severe siege and extreme distress; and they pled their cause with him
 with the greatest emphasis, and begged him to deliver them from this enemy, who
 was carrying out the designs against them. And while they proceeded on their
 journey, the king collected his assembly, and God made a revelation to him in
 that night, saying: "Do not fear, O Yush'a, behold I am about to give over into
 thy hands these five chiefs; do not let a single man of them, or of their
 soldiers, escape safe." So he marched forward and surprised the army of the
 enemies by night, and the watchword of the children of Israil was GOD THE
 OMNIPOTENT IN BATTLES, GOD IS HIS NAME. And the five kings were driven in
 flight before them unto Kasahah, and unto Maqadah (Makkedah). And when the
 children of Israil came up with them, they conquered them, and did not spare in
 killing them. And Yush'a spoke unto the day to stand still, and it stood still;
 and the day was great, for God heard the voice of the children of Israil, and
 sent forth the angels with them. And the five kings, the chiefs already
 mentioned, fled and found a cave in Maqadah. Then the king ordered to place
 great stones on the mouth of the cave, that he might keep them under guard,
 until they (the children of Israil) should return, when they have made an end
 of destroying the rest of the army. And he killed the multitude of the people,
 and not a single man of them did escape safe. Then they returned to the cave,
 and the king gave command to bring them (the five kings) out, and to throw them
 down upon their faces and ordered the prominent leaders of the army to tread
 with the soles of their shoes upon their necks; and he said to the children of
 Israil: "Be strong and of good courage, and fear not, nor be dismayed, for thus
 shall God do with your enemies." The he gave command that the kings should be
 killed, and be crucified until the setting of the sun; and after sunset he gave
 orders, that they should be placed in the cave to which they fled, along with
 the wood upon which they had been crucified, and also that there should be
 placed over the mouth of the cave, a mound of stones, to perpetuate the
 knowledge of this unto the end of ages. And they did what he ordered, and the,
 being gladdened, assembled together.</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER XXI</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF THIS ARMY, AND ITS TRIUMPH, </p>
 
 <p>AND THE DESTRUCTION OF ITS ENEMIES.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   When it was the beginning of the eight
 month (now this is the time of the journeying of this army), the king divided
 the infantry and cavalry into three bands, and sent each band in a different
 direction, while he and they who were with him journeyed along in the highway,
 tending towards the hostile people; and he first alone was the one who
 surprised the enemies' camp, and he held them for a considerable time in an
 engagement, and they were not as yet recovered from the surprise, when there
 arose a cloud of dust, and the army approached from every side. And when the
 children of Israil behold one another, they shouted out with loudest voice: God
 is our Lord, who wages instead of us the war." And God on that day showed
 miracles with the enemy, for it came to pass that every one who would flee fire
 met him and burned him up. And a spectre appeared among them, so that the
 horses did stampede with them, upon hearing the shouts of the children of
 Israil and carried them down to death; and the hours of the day were lengthened
 out for them, as God had promised them, until they had accomplished in it the
 results of a whole year, and not a remnant in it the results of a whole year,
 and not a remnant of the enemies was left after this battle. And the king from
 Mahzun wrote a letter unto el-Azar, the imam, binding it on the wing of a bird;
 telling him in it the good news about what God had bestowed upon them, and what
 He had shown forth among them of miracles and signs, which should be eulogized.
 And he also informed him that he would not return until he should have taken possession
 of the remaining territorial districts for the children of Israil. And he set
 the bird at liberty on the mourning of the fifth day, and it immediately
 proceeded on its journey, under the blessing of God and the goodness of His
 guidance and grace. </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   And he (Yush'a) continued descending upon
 one city after another, and taking possession of  them, and doing with the rebellious like unto what we have
 already mentioned, until he had completed the subjugation of the territories,
 and then he returned in the first month of the second year. And it resulted,
 that he, in one year, took possession of all their territories, and this was
 the region of the seven Kana'anites, whose fame is enduring, well known and
 spread abroad. Then he and all who were with him removed apart for
 purification; now there descended from the blessed mountain a great river which
 watered the lowlands, and to it the king went down with all his army. And when
 he had completed his purification, el-Azar the imam offered up for the sacrifices,
 and they celebrated a grand feast, the carrying out of which was complete and
 consummate. Never was there witnessed a better feast than it; for the people
 were united, not having as yet dispersed throughout their territorial sections,
 and when they did shout, and praise, and exult with halleluiahs, they were
 heard in the most distant and remote places. And when the feast was over, the
 king and his assembly gathered together, and began to arrange the distribution
 of the territories among their people; and they asked God, Mighty and Powerful,
 for His favor and guidance.</b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER
 XXII.</p>
 
 <p>AN ACCOUNT OF THE APPORTIONMENT OF THE
 TERRITORIES</p>
 
 <p>BELONGING TO THE CHILDREN OF ISRAIL, AND
 THEIR BOUNDRIES.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   The king selected men from the
 geometricians and their associates, and from the land surveyors, and those who
 were well skilled in matters pertaining to lands, and from those who were
 assisted in surveying, and those who were expert in estimating. And he gave
 instructions that they should divide it into ten parts; and he himself set
 about equitably distributing the nine and one half tribes over the ten
 sections. Thereupon he defined unto them the boundaries of the lands, according
 to what our master Musa the Propet- peace be upon him- explained in the chapter
 of the boundaries, which is mentioned in the Law, where he says: "When ye come
 into the land of Kana'an (and this is the land that shall fall unto you for an
 inheritance, according to the boundaries thereof), then your south quarter
 shall be from the wilderness of Sin along by the places of Edum." And this is
 the boundary of the lands of the two and one half tribes. And then he again
 says: "And your boundary on the south shall be, from the furthest eastern part
 of the salt sea unto the side of Misr (Egypt); and the goings forth of this
 boundary shall be at the gulf." That is, from the isthmus of the wilderness; by
 which is meant the land of el-Hejaz (Arabia), and esh-Sham (Syria), and the
 pass of Haljat (?), a narrow place which reaches to the sea (the Arabah). And the
 going forth thereof shall be southward of Quds-er-Raqim"; meaning thereby, to
 the south of a place called Quds-barna (Kadesh-barnea), upon the bonders of
 esh-Sham and el-Hejaz; for the idea held by the people of that time was to the
 effect that it came unto el-Khaq (?) until it reached unto the Nil of Misr
 (Nile of Egypt), which is the valley whose going forth are to the sea, the
 coast line of which extents from Misr to Falastin (Palestine) and to er-Rum
 (Greece). "And your western boundary shall be the last sea." And the last sea
 is from Misr unto esh-Sham. "And the border towards esh-Sahm extends from the
 great sea to the mountain el-Jabal (Mount. Hor) and to Ainan of Hums
 (Hazar-enan)." The king here meaning the bend in the mountain el-Libnan (Lebanon),
 as far as the limit of its land in the district of Dimashq (Damascus), until
 coming eastward it goes around it, and returns sloping downwards unto the
 Urdun, and its goings forth are unto the salt sea, which is the final point
 designated in the beginning of the chapter. "And this," (said Joshua) "is the
 smaller part of the assigned land but they (the surveyors) shall make a return
 on the half of the greater assigned territories, according to the sum of the
 census of the nine and one half tribes." Then he instructed them that they
 should set apart forty-eight cities, out of all the territories of the children
 of Israil, unto the Liwanites, taken out from the divisions; and from their
 total number there should be six cities of them (even three cities from the
 whole number of the cities of the two and one half tribes, and three cities
 form the whole of the assigned lands of the nine and one half tribes),
 concerning which cities God- Mighty and Powerful- gave command that they should
 be set apart, and he named them; "Cities of repulse"; that is, of refuge to the
 one who flees thereunto, even to the one who should kill his companion
 inadvertently, that is, by accident, or through carelessness, without
 intention, or malice aforethought; so would these cities be a repulse to the
 avenger. And the slayer shall not be killed until he shall have stood before
 the judge and the assembly of the leaders; and now if he did kill
 intentionally, he shall himself be killed; but, if it was through carelessness,
 then he shall flee unto some one of these cities, and he shall not go forth
 from it until the chief imam dies; and if he do go forth outside of the
 boundary of this city, and the avenger meet him and slay him, then shall he be
 innocent of his blood. And the men (that is, the geometricians and the
 estimators and they who ere skilled in matters pertaining to lands) started out
 on their journey, according as they had been commanded.</b></p>

 XXIII.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF WHAT YUSH'A DID UNTIL THE</p>
 
 <p>SURVEYORS RETUNED UNTO HIM.</p>
 
 <p><b> </b></p>
 
 <p><b>   After this the king assembled the two and
 one half tribes before el-Azar, the imam- peace be upon him-and the leaders;
 and they thanked them for their deeds and the help and assistance they had
 rendered, and said unto them: "Ye have zealously observed the covenant of God
 and the covenant of our master Musa- the best of peace be upon him- and there
 now no longer remains to us an argument against you; for verily, ye have acted
 kindly, and have preserved life and borne hardships, and have been patient in
 abstaining from visiting those whom ye have left behind, until your brothers
 have gained their goal in taking possession of their assigned lands. And now
 your standing is exalted, and your deeds grow before God your Lord, who is the
 rewarder of good deeds, with their like a thousand- fold; and ye have got
 possession of your assigned lands, which are most excellent for your people,
 and in them ye have no opponent or oppressor. And these are our wishes of good
 fortune to you in it: may God multiply unto you in addition to it, its like."
 Then he gathered together their prominent men, and invested them with robes of
 honor, and gave presents unto them. And he commanded them and enjoined upon
 them, to go over the list of the census; and they did this, and not a single man
 of them was missing. And they did eat and drink together, and renewed the
 covenant between them, that they would remain in obedience unto God always, and
 in the love of His Prophet, and keep His commandments; and that they would come
 to the support of one another whenever any tidings should reach them, whether
 by night or by day, in ease or in distress, in joy or in sorrow; nor would they
 have a falling out with each other, nor pretend to be asleep; but, on the
 contrary, would vie with one another in showing haste and speed. And they
 proceeded to bind themselves unto this with a great oath. And el-`Azar, the
 imam- peace be upon him- offered up for them the sacrifices, and then the
 leaders of the congregation of the children of Israil gathered together to bid
 them farewell. Thereupon the king appointed as king over the 110,580 men (which
 was the number of the two and one half tribes), Nabih (Nobah)the son of Jil'ad
 (Gilead), of the tribe of Manashehah, and invested him with the royal robe, and
 placed upon him a crown, and had him ride one of his chosen horses, and sent
 forth before him a herald, proclaiming: "This is the king of the two and one
 half tribes, who is invested with their judicial matters, who shall oversee
 their affairs; the chief leader of their army; the chief orator among them; the
 one who shall be asked concerning their affairs and every judgment of his shall
 be carried out, and in whatever matter of judgment to el-`Azar, the imam- peace
 be upon him. O assembled men! Whosoever shall oppose his decree, or withdraw
 from obedience to him, the blood of this one can be shed, and all the people
 shall be innocent of his crime." Then he delivered unto him a copy of the book
 of our master Musa, the son of `Amran the Prophet- peace be upon him- and he enjoined
 him to read it night and day, and informed him that in it were marvelous
 indicatory signs, showing how life may be prolonged in this present fleeting
 world and in the world to come, and also that in its reading was protection
 from spirits, and the evil eye, and calamities, and witchery, and the skill of
 the enemy. And he gave over to him twelve tribes, whom he commanded to adhere
 unto him and not leave him, until he should have corresponded with every chief
 of a tribe resident at the court of the king and the saint of God; and he also
 selected for him men from the learned, who might ease him in the administration
 of the government, and whom he might consult in important matters which
 unexpectedly arose to him. And, moreover, he gave over to him two thousand men
 of the Liwanites, who should take up their residence in the cities that had
 been set apart unto them among these tribes, and these should receive the
 portion of God, and the portion of His saints: tithes and votive offerings; and
 should perform whatsoever sacrifices were incumbent upon them in every month,
 and should execute the judicial sentences in the presence of their leaders, and
 should establish prayers for them, and oversee the matters which it is unlawful
 for any body else but them to do. Thereupon the banners were unfurled before
 him (Nabih) and the trumpets sounded, and the saint of God and the king
 (Joshua) rode out with their assembly to bid them farewell; and it was a great
 day, the like of which it was not possible could have existed in the world. And
 they proceeded on their journey under the protection of God, victorious,
 triumphant, happy and rejoicing. And when the news reached their friends who
 were watching over their affairs on the other side of the Urdun, their assembly
 came out to meet them. And Nabih divided out that region according to the sum
 of the number of his companions. And the Liwanites entered into their places,
 and attended to the offering of praises and halleluiahs. And glory be to God,
 for His bountiful favors unto them. </b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER
 XXIV.</p>
 
 <p>THE ACCOUNT OF THE RETURN OF THE MEN WHO
 WERE EMINENT IN MAKING</p>
 
 <p>SURVEYS AND ESTAMATING JUST PROPORTIONS,
 UNTO</p>
 
 <p>YUSH'A, THE SON OF NUN, THE KING.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>   After the return of the geometricians, and
 those who were trained in surveying the land out into fields and equitably
 proportioning them, and in rendering correct judgments as to their trees and
 everything that would hinder their cultivation, the king and the twelve chiefs
 assembled together. Now these were they to whom our master Musa the Prophet-
 peace be upon him- had given instructions that they should unite with him in
 dividing out the land; with the restriction, however, that no one should
 obstinately oppose him, nor should any quarrel or dispute occur between them;
 and they began to arrange the division of it into ten parts, and distributed
 the tribes over the ten parts according to the greater or less numbers a tribe
 had, until they had equalized all this. And when they did come to an agreement
 with regard to it, they permanently settled it and perfected it, and clearly
 set forth; and when the opinion of the assembly was agreed as to the rectitude
 of this, they brought up the lists unto the saint of God, the imam el-`Azar-
 peace be upon him- and when he had carefully perused it, he wrote it, he wrote
 with his own hand a copy of the distribution and divisions of the tribes.
 Thereupon he wrote ten tickets, inscribed on which were the parts of the
 distributions and of the assigned lands, and he wrote the name of each one of
 the parts of the tribes upon a ticket, and gave unto each several chief his
 ticket. And then each chief went apart with his people and assembled the
 leaders of his followers, and divided out every part according to the sum of
 the census, to every man according to the size of his family. And with every
 one (of the chiefs) there went forth some of the geometricians and surveyors to
 equitably arrange matters among them. And the district embracing the excellent
 mountain fell among the assigned lands of Yusha the king, the son of Nun, and
 of his comrade Kalab (Caleb) the leader of the whole tribe, and with which he
 had started out on the journey (from Egypt) in company with him (Yusha). Thus
 was every one permanently located in his place. And he (Yusha) distributed some
 of the Liwanites, every one in the place which had been set apart for him out
 of the whole of the assigned lands, over and above the division, that they
 might administer the affairs of the people in reference to prayers and judicial
 matters, and also receive the tithes and perform the sacrifices. And he
 assigned unto each tribe chief-justices who should correspond with the imam,
 and give him information of what happened in their districts. Then Yusha the
 king built a fortress on the mountain to the north of the Blessed Mount, which
 (fortress) is known as Shamrun (Samaria). And this wont was to visit with
 el-Azar one day in each week; and one day with the learned, that he might take
 counsel with them; and one day with the chiefs, that he might inquire into
 their affairs; and one day he spent in attending to his own business and
 matters; and on three days he left not the book of God, during night and day.
 And this was his method in his administration of government, when he was not
 out waging war; for he did not hold himself aloof from them. And he built a
 synagogue on the summit of the Blessed Mount, and collected and kept in it the
 tabernacle of the Lord, and no one, after him, did hold it, except the priests
 and the Liwanites. </b></p>

 <p>CHAPTER XXV.</p>
 
 <p>AN ACCOUNT OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE
 CHILDREN OF ISRAIL</p>
 
 <p>AFTER THE DISTRIBUTION.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><b>Then the children
 of Israil began to inhabit their assigned lands and to put them under perfect
 cultivation, and to worship their Lord with acceptable service, and to fulfill
 on each day whatsoever sacrifices were incumbent upon them. And God showed
 forth with them blessings and watchful care, so that calamities were removed
 away from them; and not a single one of the kings of the enemies did have power
 to do any violence unto them. So that there was a multitude of their own
 travelers journeying from every province unto the Blessed Mount three times a
 year, along with various kings, with wealth and joy and gladness; and not one
 of the enemies dared even to look towards them, or stand up in opposition to
 them. And the king and the leaders and the whole army continued in rest and
 tranquility for a period of twenty years. There was no molestation or
 insurrection since now their surrounding enemies were far removed from them and
 dispersed throughout the regions of the earth; and they who were near them had
 made peace with them, so no one was stirring up a commotion, nor was there a
 kingdom spreading itself abroad except their kingdom, or any hand outstretched
 except their hands. And not a single day did pass but that they hears news of
 all their companions; and thus did they continue to have intelligence of them,
 until this period came to a close. Then after this there happened those things
 which by the will of God, and His assistance, we will narrate and explain. (To
 Him be the praise.)</b></p>
