 <p>PREFATORY NOTE.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>   This book is printed by the generosity of
 Mr. E. K. Warren, an American friend of the Samaritans, and is furnished to the
 High Priest in order that its sale may afford a small revenue for the Samaritan
 colony. These people are very poor, and tourists who wish to assist in the
 maintenance</p>
 
 <p>Of the school
 can do so by the purchase of this and other books for sale by them.</p>
 
 <p>   The editor desires to ask American tourists
 visiting Palestine to make their purchases of Samaritan books as directly as
 possible from the priests at Nablous (Shechem). Spurious manuscripts are for
 sale by dealers and others. The High Priest guarantees that all copies of the
 Samaritan books sold at the Synagogue are correct and entire, and that the
 proceeds go to the school.</p>
 
 <p>   Throughout many centuries this singular
 little sect has continued to live under the shadow of its holy mountain. Some
 good purpose, surely, God will yet reveal through their existence. This book,
 which is curious and interesting, will assist to a correct understanding of
 their life and teaching.</p>

 <p>INTRODUCTORY NOTE.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>   The following work was prepared, at the
 request of the editor, by the Samaritan High Priest, and is designed to answer
 the questions which are most frequently asked of the Samaritan priests, both by
 strangers and by some of their own communion. He has entitled the book, "Book
 of Enlightenment for the Instruction of the Inquirer." It is written in Arabic
 in neat manuscript, the quotations from Scripture being in the Samaritan
 Hebrew, and written in red ink.</p>
 
 <p>   It cannot be pretended that the questions
 are in every case those that the average American scholar is most eager to
 purpose. But the book as a whole is not only interesting but instructive. It is
 a succinct statement of the present tenets of the Samaritans, and a fine
 example of their dialect. The attention of scholars is increasing directly to
 the Samaritans for the valuable side light which their customs throw on many
 questions of Jewish practice. The editor believes that this is a permanently
 valuable document.</p>
 
 <p>   The questions which the High Priest
 undertakes to answer are the following: -</p>
 
 <p>1.                  
 Concerning <i>the duration of the plagues of Egypt. -</i> His
 answer is, that the whole time covered by the plagues, including the intervals
 between them, was two months and a half.</p>
 
 <p>2.                  
 Concerning <i>the number and classification of the miracles. -</i>
 He counts the number as eleven, holding that the sign of the rod in the hand of
 Moses should be counted a sign in itself, in addition to the specific miracles
 wrought by it, in the plagues. He classifies the miracles as those wrought by
 God alone, those wrought by God through Moses, those wrought through Aaron, and
 those in which both Moses and Aaron employed.</p>
 
 <p>3.                  
 Concerning <i>the origin and significance of the ceremonial
 year. - </i>He holds that the new calendar established at the time of the
 Exodus was really the reestablishment of the calendar begun at the creation.</p>
 
 <p>4.                  
 Concerning<i> the time of the institution of the Passover. - </i>This
 leads him into a full discussion of all that is involved in the Passover, and
 incidentally brings in the condemnation of a heretic who taught that the
 prohibition of fire which belongs to the Sabbath does not apply to the
 Passover. This heretic, who is nameless here, lived in 1753 A.D. But he did not
 succeed in gaining converts, even his own wife deserting his teaching; and the
 priest offers a prayer for his restoration, though he would appear to have been
 long dead.</p>
 
 <p>5.                  
 Concerning <i>the Passover when the date falls on the Sabbath.
 -</i> The answer is, that, in this case, the sacrifice must take place on
 Friday, after sunset. To this answer he appends proof that Mount Gerizim is the
 one place where this sacrifice should be offered.</p>
 
 <p>6.                  
 Concerning <i>the forty years in the wilderness. - </i>The
 answer is, that the ordinances of the Passover, Circumcision, and the Shekinah
 were faithfully observed.</p>
 
 <p>7.                  
 Concerning <i>the fasts of Moses. - </i>The answer is, that
 Moses fasted for three periods of forty days each, and not merely two such
 periods.</p>
 
 <p>8.                  
 Concerning <i>the writing of the Commandments. - </i>The
 answer, is, that the Commandments were written for the sake of verbal accuracy
 and permanent preservation, and the greater reverence paid to a certain word of
 God, which might have been lost or corrupted if transmitted orally.</p>
 
 <p>9.                  
 Concerning <i>the revelation of the Torah. --</i> The answer,
 given at great length and with wide variety of proof, is, that the complete
 Torah was written in a single roll by the hand of God, and came down to Moses
 complete. The apparent exceptions are noted, and the main proposition is
 established by seven proofs.</p>
 
 <p>10.              
 Concerning<i> the two stone tablets. -- </i>The answer is, that
 the first set of two tablets was created by God on the third day of creation.
 The inscription was in horizontal lines and in uncial characters. The writing
 miraculously disappeared when Moses broke the stones; the breaking of them if
 the writing had remained would have been either impossible or a great sin. The
 second set Moses hewed out, but God wrote on them. The size was as follows:
 length, one and one half cubits; breadth, three fourths of a cubit, combined
 thickness, two and one half cubits, completely filling the ark.</p>
 
 <p>11.              
 Concerning <i>the tablets of testimony. --</i> The answer is,
 that the stone tablets were called the tablets of testimony because they were a
 living testimony and covenant, testifying both the will of God and the promise
 of his people.</p>
 
 <p>12.              
 Concerning<i> the transcription of the Torah. --</i> The answer
 is, that the written Torah was given to Moses between the two sets of tablets
 containing the Commandments, and was copied by Moses and the priests. Whether
 the original copy, written directly by God, was ever taken out of the tent,
 where Joshua guarded it, is disputed. Some hold that it was exhibited once in
 seven years. The two copies made by Moses were all that were commonly seen.</p>
 
 <p>13.              
 Concerning <i>the Jordan. -- </i>The answer is, that the Jordan
 is the river of Law. There the manna ceased, and the Law became fully
 operative.</p>
 
 <p>14.              
 Concerning <i>the shining of Moses' face. -- </i>The answer is,
 that this phenomenon- the more remarkable because Moses had been fasting for
 forty days- was due to the effulgence of the angel Gabriel, who, without the
 knowledge of Moses, lent him his own presence and celestial brightness.</p>
 
 <p>15.              
 Concerning <i>the water at Rephidim. --</i> The answer is, that
 the smiting of the rock was an authentication of Moses, and a rebuke to those
 who complained. </p>
 
 <p>16.              
 Concerning <i>the battle with the Amalekites. --</i> The answer
 is, that this was a testimony to the nations of the favor of Jehovah for his
 people Israel.</p>
 
 <p>17.              
 Concerning <i>the reason for not destroying the Amalekites
 earlier. --</i> In order that Israel might know that its strength was in
 Jehovah. In this connection the High Priest goes outside the Torah, and,
 quoting from "the book attributed to Joshua," refers to the stopping of the sun
 as an event of this campaign. The battle occurred on Friday, he explains, and
 the standing of the sun was to preserve the Sabbath unbroken by the battle.</p>
 
 <p>18.              
 Concerning <i>the time of Jethro's visit. --</i> It occurred in
 the second year of the Exodus.</p>
 
 <p>19.              
 Concerning <i>the sons of Moses. -- </i>They returned with
 their mother, and their descendants still live, nomads, but monotheists. In
 this connection the High Priest refutes the slander against Moses, that, after
 the departure of Zipporah, Moses married a negress. Against the Jews, to whom
 the priest attributes this slander, he cries, "May God fight them for this!"
 The woman, he says, was none other than Zipporah herself, and the word does not
 mean "Black" but "beautiful."</p>
 
 <p>20.              
 Concerning <i>the heir of an adulteress. -- </i>The high
 priest, who condemns her to death, inherits her property.</p>
 
 <p>21.              
 Concerning <i>the face of Laban. -- </i>Jacob read the heart of
 Laban in his face, and knew that he was in disfavor. The face reveals the
 heart.</p>
 
 <p>22.              
 Concerning <i>Oaths. -- </i>The High Priest classifies these,
 with some elaboration, into oaths permissible and prohibited; the prohibited
 oaths are of three kinds- those of falsehood, conjecture, or triviality; and
 the permissible, those that affirm truthfully and reverently.</p>
 
 <p>23.              
 Concerning <i>the inheritance of a woman who marries outside
 the tribe. --</i>Her inheritance remains to her heirs within the tribe. It is
 forfeited so far as she, her husband, and her children are concerned.</p>
 
 <p>24.              
 Concerning <i>the use of rennet. -- </i>The prohibition of
 seething a kid in its mother's milk had not been carried, so far as the High
 Priest knows, to the point of forbidding the use of the kid's stomach in the
 making of cheese. When attention was called to this, however, he investigated
 the matter; and while he could find no question of this particular in the
 literature of his people, it seemed to him clear that the use of rennet was a
 violation of the Law, so he prohibited it, establishing a new precedent. In
 this, however, he does not condemn those who preceded him, as what they did in
 violation of the Law in this regard was done inadvertently.</p>
 
 <p>25.              
 Concerning <i>the abridgment by laymen of the authority of the
 priesthood. -- </i>Some laymen having insisted that there should be a group of
 lay associates with the priests to pass upon questions where the rights of the
 priesthood are involved, the High Priest refutes their claim, showing that the
 laity have no right to intermeddle in matters of his character, and
 incidentally showing with how great respect the high priest himself ought to be
 treated.</p>
 
 <p>   The High Priest closes by hurling two
 questions at those who oppose him. The first is, that they will explain the
 command not to remove the ancient landmark. The second is, that they explain
 the command, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." With these two arguments-
 one against the method, and the other against the spirit, of those who oppose
 him- the High Priest closes the book.</p>

 <p>THE
 BOOK OF ENLIGHTENMENT.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>   IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL GOD, IN WHOM IS MY TRUST. At some previous
 times, on many occasions, members of my own tribe have asked me questions, the
 solution of which was hidden from them. I have answered these inquiries from
 time to time in accordance with the best efforts of my weak mind and poor
 understanding. I have wished also to record the substance of those answers,
 both for safekeeping, and for the benefit of following generations. <i>I pray
 God for his help. Amen.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Praise be to God, the quintessence of
 Unity; the indivisible and eternal;</p>
 
 <p>   To him who is far above either mother or
 son;</p>
 
 <p>   To the forgiver of sins to every on that
 repents with purity of conscience;</p>
 
 <p>   To him who overlooks shortcomings, and
 consoles the disconsolate hearts;</p>
 
 <p>   To him who alone is perfect and eternal,
 and liable neither to malady nor disease;</p>
 
 <p>   He
 is eternal and immutable, far above destruction, or any possible damage;</p>
 
 <p>   He is the Everlasting, who is too exalted
 to be represented either by image or likeness;</p>
 
 <p>   And is far above measurement or drawing.</p>
 
 <p>   He is described by the most exalted names;</p>
 
 <p>   To him belongs the ineffable name "AHIH
 ASHR AHIH."</p>
 
 <p>   He is the one who hears and beholds all
 things.</p>
 
 <p>   Verily he hears the flowing of water in the
 most parched wilderness,</p>
 
 <p>   And sees the black ants in the darkest
 recesses of the rock. </p>
 
 <p>   There is no God but he;</p>
 
 <p>   None but he is worthy to be worshipped.</p>
 
 <p>   He is invisible, eternal in his eternity,</p>
 
 <p>   And Lord of all the heavens.</p>
 
 <p>   Exalted and blessed be his Name!</p>
 
 <p>   He is praised in the secret and in the
 open;</p>
 
 <p>   In the conscience and by the tongue;</p>
 
 <p>   Inwardly and outwardly.</p>
 
 <p>   He is the only judge,</p>
 
 <p>   Who will avenge himself on the rebellious
 on the last day.</p>
 
 <p>   <i>Holy be his great name! Amen.</i></p>

 <p>I.       
 THE DURATION OF THE PLAGUES OF EGYPT.</p>
 
 <p>      I have been asked, concerning the
 wonders which took place with respect to Pharaoh and his people, How long did
 each and all of the plagues last? The answer is as follows: -</p>
 
 <p>   As to the period during which the wonders
 took place by the hand of our lord, the apostle Moses (upon whom be peace),[1]
 while he was in Egypt, it was that of two months and a half.</p>
 
 <p>   The first wonder took place in the eleventh
 month, and the last took place in the first. It is so affirmed by our
 traditions, handed down from father to son, and is so accepted and agreed upon
 by the people of Israel.</p>
 
 <p>   We believe that the wonder of the staff
 that turned into a serpent lasted less than a single day. As to the wonder of
 blood, it lasted seven days; for we read: "And seven days were fulfilled after
 Jehovah[2]
 had smitten the river." The period of the wonder of frogs lasted two days. That
 of the plague of lice is not mentioned. Some assert that the plague has
 continued on Egypt ever since that day[3].</p>
 
 <p>   The plague of flies lasted only one day,
 and left them on the day following. The miracle of the destruction of the
 cattle lasted only one hour. As to the wonder of the boils with blains, it
 lasted a whole week. The miracle with the hail lasted one day; likewise lasted
 the plague of locusts. The miracle of darkness lasted three days, as we read:
 "For a period of three days no man saw his brother." The period of the killing
 of the first-born lasted one single hour. To one who might make the statement
 that these periods would not make out the total time of two and one half
 months, as previously indicated, the answer is, that there transpired some
 intervals of time between one miracle and another. It is asserted that the time
 divisions were uniform, and that each was of seven days, including the period
 of each miracle and the interval; for, as soon as the miracle of blood ceased,
 the Nile let loose on them its frogs, and the whole earth was filled with them.
 However, a certain amount of space elapsed after each miracle, that the two
 apostles might have time to carry their message to Pharaoh and to receive his
 reply thereto, and act accordingly. Thus the whole period of miracles amounted
 to two months and a half.</p>
 
 <p><i>   And God possesses the best knowledge of all
 things.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <h6 align="CENTER">II.      THE
 NUMBER AND CLASSIFICATION OF THE MIRACLES.</h6>
 
 <p>   The next question is concerning the meaning
 of the words "Pharaoh shall not listen to you."</p>
 
 <p>   The first purpose of this prediction is in
 order that the words of God may be confirmed; namely, "Pharaoh shall not listen
 to you, and I will produce my power upon the Egyptians." It was God's purpose
 that Pharaoh should know and feel, together with his people, these signs and
 wonders while he was still hardened in his unbelief.</p>
 
 <p>   Secondly, that these miracles might be a
 warning to those who should come later on. Otherwise it would have been
 possible for God to destroy Pharaoh with his people in the twinkling of an eye.
 In fact, God desired by this prediction and his delay to show the greatness of
 his apostle and the veracity of his statements; he therefore performed these
 astounding wonders through him as a memorial to all the generations, in order
 that the one who reads them, and meditates on them, may continue in his
 fidelity to him and consider and fear the treacherous unbeliever. He made us
 know, therefore, that the unwillingness of Pharaoh to hearken unto his two
 messengers resulted in what he said," that my miracles may be multiplied in the
 land of Egypt." The genuineness of the mission of these two men was proved; for
 we read: "and Moses and Aaron performed all these miracles" (Ex.xi.10). There
 exist among the learned men some who claim that these miracles amounted to ten
 in number, thus omitting from their reckoning the miracle of the staff which
 was turned into a serpent. Some say that the latter is only a sign, and not a
 miracle. But those who claim that the number of miracles is ten do
 unconsciously prove it to be twenty, for, according to them, the happening of
 the miracles is miraculous and its disappearance is also miraculous.</p>
 
 <p>It
 is more correct, however, to count them as eleven miracles, for the matter of
 the staff was both a sign and a miracle, according to the statement of God:
 "Show me a sign," or a miracle (Ex. Vii. 9); for a sign is in itself a miracle.
 This statement is proved by the words of God, which have already been quoted
 (Ex. xi. 10), which verse includes all the miracles that have transpired. The
 same is affirmed by more than one of God's statements, as in the same chapter
 and verse, "and God hardened the heart of Pharaoh; he neither hearkened unto
 them nor let the people depart from his land."</p>
 
 <p>   These miracles include within themselves
 many others, the details of which are lengthy and numerous. Here are, however,
 some of the principal divisions. </p>
 
 <p>1.       The
 bringing of the flies, murrain, and the killing of the first-born. These are
 the direct doings of God, without the instrumentality of the two apostles. It
 must be understood, however, that the message which accompanied these wonders
 was delivered by Moses, who, with his brother, knew about them. </p>
 
 <p>2.        Those which were done by God by the hand of
 Moses alone, while Aaron had simply to notify Pharaoh with the words of his
 brother. They are the hail, the locusts, and the darkness. These were done
 simply by Moses, and Aaron had only in the intercession which accompanied them.</p>
 
 <p>3.       These
 which God performed by the hand of Aaron, while Moses had only to give command.
 They are the turning of the staff into a serpent, the miracle of frogs, and
 that of lice. </p>
 
 <p>4.       Those
 in which both brothers took part. They are the turning of water into blood, and
 the boils.</p>
 
 <p>   But the real agent of all was indeed God
 (who is highly exalted). He only used these two apostles to prove the
 truthfulness of their message, and to show forth their high character and
 standing, and that the rest of the world might know, as we have already stated.
 The line found in Ex. Xi. 9 does simply indicate to us that there were
 performed ten wonders on Pharaoh; and that, in spite of their bitterness and
 hardship, in spite of the tortures which he suffered therefrom, he did not let
 the children of Israel depart from his land except after the killing of the
 first-born, which wonder makes the eleventh. Compare Ex. Vii. 3: "And I will .
 . . . multiply my signs and my wonders in the land of Egypt. But Pharaoh will
 not hearken unto you until I lay my hand on Egypt, and bring out my hosts, my
 people the children of Israel, from the land of Egypt." The laying of his hand
 does not refer to the killing of the first-born: "And I will stretch forth my
 hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I shall perform in the midst of
 it. Thereupon he shall let you depart" (Ex. Iii. 20). This verse refers to the
 performance of all the wonders. <i>And to God belongs the best knowledge.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>III.         
 THE ORIGIN AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE CEREMONIAL YEAR.</p>
 
 <p>   I have been asked, concerning the passage
 "This month shall be to you the beginning of months" (Ex. Xii.2), Did the
 Israelites know, previous to this statement, that this month was the first
 month of their year, or did they begin so to look on it afterwards? The
 following is in answer. <i> And my
 success comes from God.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Yes; they knew it as the first month from
 ancient times; for, in the account of the deluge (Gen. viii. 13), we read: "In
 the six hundredth and first year and the first month, on the first day of the
 month," etc. The same mention is given in Ex. xii. 2, in order that the noble
 and exalted nature of the month might be shown, and that we might know that the
 delivery of the children of Israel from Egypt's bondage took place thereon.
 There is, however, a stronger reason. It is called the first month of the year,
 that we may thereby find with exactness the various times of the year which we
 are commanded to observe, and as such they are called the days of fulfillment
 of righteousness. During the same, on well-known periods we have our festival
 days. Compare the reference given in Ex. Xii. 3, "Speak to the congregation of
 Israel, saying, that on the tenth of this month, they shall take for themselves
 each a sheep," etc. Read as far as the sixth verse, wherein it is said, "and it
 shall be kept by you until the fourteenth of this month." From these references
 we conclude that this month was the first, and with it the year begins; that on
 the tenth day of the same month sacrificial offerings are to be chosen and kept
 till the close of the fourteenth day. The sacrifices should take place on the
 evening of the night of the fifteenth of the month. Beginning with that day up
 to the twenty-first, unleavened bread must be eaten for seven days; and that
 day, which is the twenty-first, must be spent in the service of God. In this
 manner the arrangement of festival days was made out, each according to his
 time and month, as their order is given in the Book of the Law; and that is why
 the month is called the first.</p>
 
 <p>   As to the command that the celebration of
 the Passover on its proper times should take place to the end of generations,
 it is because the offering of Passover during the days of Darkness are
 equivalent to those of the entire year. They are equivalent to the peace
 offerings. To continue to celebrate the same will lead us to the days of the
 appearance of God's Pleasure and the coming of the second prophet. The mystery
 which affirms God's Pleasure, falling as it does in this month, will doubtless
 be approved to us that the return of God's Pleasure will be during the same
 month, namely, the first. As to the command of God in reference to the
 celebration of the Passover in its time, one is referred to Ex. Xii. 17: "Ye
 shall observe and fulfill this day in your generations as an eternal ordinance";
 "Ye shall keep this command as an eternal ordinance to thee and to thy
 children" (ver. 24). Again: "Thou shalt keep this ordinance in its time from
 year to year" (Ex. Xiii. 10). Compare also Deut. xvi. 1: "Keep the month of
 Abib." Thus it appears that the month of Abib is the first month, corresponding
 to April. The keeping of this month is simply for giving praise and tanks to
 God for having saved them from the servitude of the Egyptians. They should also
 continue to mention the reason for God's action in bringing them out of Egypt.
 See, therefore, Deut. xvi. 12: "and remember also that thou wert a slave in the
 land of Egypt." As to the usefulness of celebrating this ordinance from year to
 year as the ages pass, it consists in blotting out the sins of each year as
 long it is kept on the first month, which is April, when occur the return of
 God's Pleasure and the reappearance and reestablishment of the Shekinah on
 Mount Gerizim. As to the time and place, both are proved by the word of God.
 The Shekinah was established in the wilderness by Moses on the first month, and
 when our lord Joshua (upon whom be peace) set it up on Mount Gerizim, it was on
 the first month. Its return will be by the will of God on the first month. And
 that is the reason why God commanded and declared the keeping of its season. As
 to the place, it shall be in the chosen place, the place whose selection was
 revealed after their entrance into the Holy Land. No other place shall be
 substituted for it; only in it and within its boundaries. In proof of the same,
 compare Deut. xvi. 5: "It shall not be lawful unto me to sacrifice the Passover
 within any of the towns, " etc. and: "But it must be in the place which the
 Lord thy God has chosen that his name may dwell there. There shalt thou sacrifice
 the Passover in the evening at sunset," etc. This place is Mount Gerizim. <i>And
 God knows all things.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>IV.         
 THE TIME OF THE INSTITUTION OF THE PASSOVER.</p>
 
 <p>  
 Were the apostles Moses and Aaron given the ordinance of the Passover,
 and the manner of its performance, on the first day of the first month, or on
 some other of its days previous to the fourteenth?</p>
 
 <p>   There is a variety of opinions given by the
 learned men. Some claim that the probability is that the command was given on
 the first of the month, with the provision that on the tenth they should choose
 the offerings and keep them under surveillance until the evening of the
 fourteenth. During these days the offerings would have been washed daily, and
 cleansed and purified from all the blemishes and forms of animal filth until
 the Egyptians were assured that Israel was ready to offer them to his God.
 Their intention was revealed during this period of four days, and the Egyptians
 could not pretend that the Israelites had sacrificed their offerings in a
 concealed manner. There are others who claim that the command was given by God
 only on the fourteenth of April, on the day known as Alfajool. In proof of the
 same compare Ex. xi. 4: "In the midst of the night I will go out into the midst
 of the land of Egypt." Pharaoh, who realized that every threatening made him by
 the apostle Moses (upon whom be peace) would be fulfilled, placed guards around
 his own first-born prince, lest he should perish with the first-born of the
 Egyptians. Naturally he commanded them to watch over his son without
 remittance, and not to sleep throughout the whole night. The guards were
 probably men of trust, famous for their courage and daring, and they obeyed the
 command of Pharaoh with all diligence. While they were in the most careful act of
 watchfulness over the first-born of Pharaoh, behold the latter was dead in the
 midst of them, while they were around him and without having noticed any one
 entering among them. These words belong to the high priest Merkah (may God's
 pleasure be upon him). Amen.</p>
 
 <p>   Now if any one should say that, if God's
 command was given on the fourteenth of the month, he would not have said, also,
 "on the tenth of this month," in reply to this question it must be said that
 the words of God here form a part of the ordinance of the Passover, and they
 were a command to those of the coming generations, for he said also: "That
 which remaineth of it until mourning shall be burned in fire" (Ex. xii. 10);
 while they did not remain in Egypt, but rather got up early and left in all
 haste.</p>
 
 <p>   Now the reconciliation of this command of
 the Passover in a year when it shall fall on the Sabbath will be given in its
 time, if God will help.</p>
 
 <p>   The learned elder, of blessed memory,
 Ishmael Arrabjee, mentioned in his book named "Hitoroth,"- that is to say,
 Legislation, - informs us that the command of the Lord to the two apostles took
 place on the day known to us as the day of Alfajool, while they were still in
 Egypt on the night of the Passover.</p>
 
 <p>   Thus our learned men differ. <i>And God
 possesses the best knowledge.</i></p>
 
 <p>   This book became extinct in the twelfth
 century, because none took care of it in those days. Part of it is still with
 the writer, and another part with some of the Samaritan people. If God will
 grant me the required years I shall gather what can be found according to my
 ability. It contains Toroot and Mosoot, and possesses some fine
 interpretations. These words belong to my uncle, the generous and literary
 sheik Shamsu- Deen Sadkah. May God grant him forgiveness; for it is a very interesting
 book. <i>And the knowledge of the unknown belongs to God.</i></p>
 
 <p><i>Remarks concerning the Ordinance of the Passover.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Our people who swell in the villages and
 countries which are more or less remote from the Chosen Place used to sacrifice
 the offerings of the Passover where they lived. We know also, from verified
 reports, that in those days a party that belonged to the Chosen Place used to
 burn large fires upon the top of Mount Gerizim, that those living in the
 adjacent countries, such as Askelon, and Caesarea, and other towns, might see
 the same and act accordingly. Those who came and sacrificed in the Chosen Place
 were permitted to sacrifice either sheep or oxen, but those who sacrificed in
 other places were not permitted to sacrifice, except sheep. But in our
 generation, and ion the past ones beginning from a period of three hundred
 years ago. It has been agreed that offerings shall be made nowhere except on
 the Chosen Place, or if the mountain itself should ever become impossible, then
 on its slope or in places as near to it as practicable.</p>
 
 <p>   This is to harmonize with the saying of God
 in Deut. xvi. 5: "It shall not be lawful unto thee to sacrifice the Passover
 within any of thy gates, [that is, in towns,] which the Lord they God has given
 thee, but only in the Place which the Lord thy God has chosen, that his name
 might dwell therein. There shalt thou sacrifice the Passover."</p>
 
 <p>   Again, the custom has not varied from
 ancient times until the present (that is, from the period of two hundred years
 ago until now), that only sheep, and none else, shall be used for sacrifices.
 In our days it has been agreed to choose only sheep of white color, because
 that is the color of the best and the noblest of the sheep. He who lives in any
 other place beyond the boundaries of the Chosen Place must hasten to the Chosen
 Place, and there sacrifice the Passover. Should he be late in coming without
 having any legal cause to delay him, he commits a great sin, and becomes liable
 to what God ordered in Num. ix. 13: "If a man be clean, and does not make a
 journey, and has failed to sacrifice the Passover, that soul shall be cut off
 from among the people; for he has not sacrificed to God in season. That man
 shall bear his own sins." If a man asks, How can a man bear his own sins if he
 has been cut off from his own people? And, Did he not pay for his sins by
 having been killed? The answer is, that since his action was intentional, his
 sins will be counted against him till the day of vengeance, when, in the day of
 judgment and account, he shall be compelled to render an account of his sins
 and shall be punished for them. His killing became necessary both because he
 has offended his Lord, and also in order that others in this world may be led
 to consider and not transgress likewise.</p>
 
 <p>   Questions of this character are numerous in
 the Law. Among the conditions of the Passover is that the sacrifices shall be
 chosen on the tenth of the month and kept with diligence until the time of
 their offering, according to the command of God in Ex. xii. 3, etc.: "On the
 tenth of this month they shall take for themselves every man a lamb according
 to the houses of their fathers, a lamb for every house; and if the house be too
 small for a lamb, the family shall join in company with its neighbor who lives
 nearest to his house according to the numbers of souls," etc., to the line
 where it is said, "the same shall be kept until the fourteenth day of the
 month." During these five days the sacrifices must be examined, and the
 condition of the animals found out, lest they have some of the objections to
 disqualify them, such as blisters, which is characteristic of the sheep, or a
 redness of eye, or a possibly fatal disease. Their hoofs must be cleansed;
 especially those parts which grow within the hoofs, for they are liable to much
 dirt, and whatever defects they may be found to possess disqualify them from
 being sacrificed. A sheep is particularly disqualified by such a blemish as a
 break in the leg or defect in sight. All their members should be cleansed from
 dirt; for they tread upon the defiled things while walking in the streets and
 highways. Occasionally there grow between their hoofs diseased parts which
 disqualify them.</p>
 
 <p>   Every Israelite must be taxed according to
 his share with the cost of those sacrifices to fulfill the command of the Lord,
 "According to their souls' price"; and this command includes all, the man and
 the woman and the child. Any one who is not taxed, and does not pay out of his
 own material substance, cannot have sacrifices. But he who is too poor, and
 does not possess anything in this world, may serve in the preparation of the
 sacrifices, and substitute his labor for money, and thus make up what he would
 have been taxed as his share. And if a man lives with a family, and has always
 been looked upon as a member of it, he may pay the taxes that will cover all
 its members, whether they be wife, child, or servants, in accordance with the
 words of God found in Ex. xii. 4: "If the house, however, has no one to pay the
 full price, it may join with its nearest neighbor, and the price be divided in
 accordance with the number of those who partake of the sacrifice." This, of
 course, was in the days of the large growth and multitude of the Israelites,
 but when their conditions changed for the worse, and their number decreased
 exceedingly, a number of them, large or small, would agree and undertake to
 procure their sacrifices as they saw fit. But nowadays, on account of our small
 number, we make a common fund of the little we possess. We all gather together into
 one company and have one furnace, and this has been done for nearly one hundred
 and twenty-five years. This we do because of our weakness and ill prosperity,
 and on account of the days of darkness. It is not permissible for any one to
 sacrifice except with his own relations. Of course the married woman, wherever
 she is, will sacrifice with her husband and will eat with him.</p>
 
 <p>   Among other ordinances is one that, on the
 fourteenth day, all the people of Israel should cleanse their houses and
 dwelling places, and clear them out entirely of leaven, according to Ex. xxiii.
 18: "Do not offer thy sacrifices with leavened bread, and let no fat of the
 Passover remain until morning." Therefore, the people of Israel agreed not to
 eat leavened bread on that day. Moreover, in order that any leaven previously
 eaten may have been digested thoroughly in the body, they eat not leavened
 bread on the fourteenth, lest they violate the words of the Lord by eating it
 for eight days. Compare Ex. xii. 18: "By an ordinance forever ye shall eat
 unleavened bread in the first month on the fourteenth day at even until the
 twenty-first at even." According to this command, seven days only must be
 completed. </p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that none of the
 people of Israel should offer sacrifices unless he be pure in body, void of all
 defilements and their causes. He must not have the least reason of being
 defiled.</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that the whole people
 should gather together, according to Ex. xii. 6: "And the whole company of the
 children of Israel should kill it at evening, " that they all may witness the
 offerings of God, and all may remember his favors upon them and upon their
 forefathers, and the signs and wonders which he performed for them, their
 delivery from servitude.</p>
 
 <p>   This remembrance is necessary/ Compare Ex.
 xii. 14: "It shall be a memorial unto you this day." Compare also what Moses
 said, "Remember also this day" (Ex. xiii. 3). Much can be said in reference to
 these commands.</p>
 
 <p>   During the celebration of the Passover the
 people must indulge greatly in praises, in exultations and glorifications, and
 must not cease doing so throughout the whole night; for it is called the Night
 of God. Compare, with others, Ex. xii, 42: "This night belongs to God; it shall
 be kept by the children of Israel in all their generations."</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that the offering
 should be sacrifices at evening, not before and not after. It must be done as
 the sun goes under, that it may have a well-defined demarcation. As to our
 custom when the Passover falls on the Sabbath, it will be explained later on,
 by God's Word.</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that the sacrifice
 which is offered must be examined internally, lest it may have broken bones, or
 weak lungs, or any internal disease.</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that all its fat,
 including the two kidneys, must be taken away, for if any of these remain with
 it it cannot be offered. The right shoulder, together with the fat, must be
 removed, before it can be broiled with the meat.</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that it must be
 broiled thoroughly in fire. There is no question about the verse in Deut. xvi.
 7. It does not imply that the meat should be cooked with water, for the command
 has already been given that it should not be eaten raw or cooked with water."</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that it must be
 salted according to the common taste. It must not be eaten without salt.
 Compare Lev. ii. 13: With all thine oblations thou shalt offer salt."</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that it must be eaten
 in the middle of the night, and all those who partake of it must do so in the
 guise of men who are about to go on a journey and are prepared to travel. They
 must be girded in the middle; must have their leather shoes on their feet, and
 their staves in their hands, according to Ex. xii. 11: "Thus shall ye eat it.
 Your loins must be girded, your sandals must be on your feet and your staves in
 your hands." In other words, in eating it the triumph and joy of the Exodus may
 be celebrated, for it is a Passover and a salvation from the oppression in
 which our forefathers found themselves: "Ye shall eat it greedily, for it is a
 Passover to God." Thus they would remember the departure of the forefathers
 from Egypt. They ate it while on the point of departure, and they ate it with
 greediness, on account of the anxiety caused by the impending journey: "For
 haste hast thou left Egypt: that thou mayest remember thy departure out of the
 land of Egypt all the days of thy life" (Deut. xvi. 3).</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that it must be eaten
 with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. As to the eating of it with unleavened
 bread, it is to remind them of the state of oppression and poverty and
 difficulty in which they were while in Egypt; for unleavened bread was called,
 in another place, <i>lehem eneh</i>, that is, "the bread of the poor" For often
 the poor, and those on the point of a long journey on account of their poverty,
 haste or hunger, would take the flour, and knead it and bake it all at once,
 and eat it in haste without waiting for it to be leavened. The traveler may do
 likewise from his haste or the anxiety which he feels. He may become impatient
 should he wait until it becomes leavened. <i>But God possess the best
 knowledge.</i></p>
 
 <p>   As to the eating of bitter herbs, it is
 that they may remember also the bitter lives which their forefathers lived, the
 oppressive servitude and the excessive tasks with which they were cumbered. As
 to the making of unleavened bread, it must be done with all carefulness lest
 any foreign matter be mixed with it. It must be selected from the whole amount
 of wheat chosen for the season. It must be cleansed, especially at its grinding
 at the mill; it must not be gathered up out of the wheat which has been
 threshed by the oxen, for while they are drawing the threshing instrument they
 might defile it by their urine and dung. Compare Lev. xxii. 25: "Neither from
 the hand of a foreigner shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these,
 because their corruption is in them; there is a blemish in them; they shall not
 be accepted for you." Now if there is no wheat of which the conditioned portion
 can be taken; if there be no Israelitish farmers from whom the required amount
 can be taken, ears of wheat must be picked at the time of harvest and preserved
 until it can be prepared for the making of unleavened bread.</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that the lamb must be
 roasted entirely as a whole, with its head and its legs, without any part being
 cut off, except the right shoulder, which is removed that the same may be eaten
 afterward, being the property of the priests, the sons of Levi. Compare Ex.
 xii. 9: "Its head with its legs and the inwards thereof."</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that it must not be
 taken out from the place where it is cooked; it must not be taken from one
 place to another: "Thou shalt not carry forth aught of the flesh `brought out
 of the house'" (Ex. xii. 46), lest it may undergo some disqualification, or
 lest it may be changed. No bone of it shall be broken. "Neither shall ye break
 the bones thereof."</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that no foreigner
 shall touch it, and no foreigner shall eat of it except him who possess the
 religion of Israel and has been circumcised, he may eat of it; he may sacrifice
 it as any of the Israelites, according to Ex. xii. 44: "But every man's servant
 who is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat
 thereof."</p>
 
 <p>   Now as to strangers, our Law says (in the
 same chapter, ver. 48): "When a stranger shall sojourn with thee and will keep
 the Passover of Jehovah, if he be a male, let him be circumcised; then he shall
 be as one born in the land." This statement includes any one, whether he be
 stranger or not, who has taken up this religion and introduced himself under
 the ordinances of the of the Law. He who does that, let it be announced to him
 that his standing before God and in the house of the Lord is like the standing
 of the Israelite. For he said in the same chapter, "He shall be like a native
 in the land, for he has submitted himself and restrained his passions unto the
 will of God. Let him therefore be fruitful."</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that its fat must be
 burned, and whatever fatness may be found in the head and in the shoulder, and
 whatever may remain of the flesh and bones and members, without leaving a
 particle of it, in accordance with the command of God in Ex. xii. 10: "leave
 nothing of it until the morning."</p>
 
 <p>   Every Israelite must cease working, that he
 may have a part in the offering of the sacrifice. The least work must not be
 done, and he who excludes the preparation of food in general, claiming that it
 can be done on the day of the Passover, he has surely ignored the word of God,
 for if any work were intended besides that of Passover the word "only" or
 "singly" would not have been employed. For this work does surely refer to the
 Passover only, and therefore the taking part in the Passover is the only thing
 that can be done at the prescribed time, in accordance with the command of God.
 If, however, the objector of these explanations would suggest that God, in
 saying "for every soul," meant that whatever may be eaten may be prepared on
 the day of the Passover, but must not be eaten except by the Israelite who is
 pure, the answer is, that God had this command only for the children of Israel,
 and if he had simply said, "Whatever may be eaten by every soul may be
 prepared," we might be convinced. But since he added a conditional word, which
 is <i>ibdo, </i>namely, "only" or "singly," and concluded his saying by the
 word <i>ikm</i>, that is, "to you," it follows that he meant the Passover, and
 that they alone were responsible for its observance. <i>And to God belongs the
 highest wisdom.</i></p>
 
 <p>   If, however, some one may say that the
 preparation of the is simply limited to a day, but not the preparation of other
 food God meant for two days, namely, that day of the Passover and the day of
 the Feast of Unleavened Bread, he is surely mistaken; for the saying of Jehovah
 referred only to the day of the Passover. Yes, God said that the least doing
 must not be done in them, namely, in those two days, but he made an additional remark
 in Ex. xii.16, which surely refers to the Passover only. The duty of every
 Israelite should be to be diligent and watchful lest something disqualifying
 might happen to his sacrifice.</p>
 
 <p>   Another condition is, that early in the
 morning the whole host shall rise and depart to their places and homes. Compare
 Deut. xvi. 7: "Then in the mourning go to and leave for thy tents." The duty of
 every Israelite is, that he should make known the joy of the Passover in his
 home, and should bless God for the salvation of his home, and should bless God
 for salvation of his forefathers from their enemies; and for the standing, the
 high standing which is only his; and for the help by which he has been enabled
 to fulfill his Passover duty, especially in the days of darkness; for the
 absence of harm done by his enemies; and for the liberty given him in preparing
 his sacrifice. Such things must be attributed to God's mercy and favor, and
 should be looked upon as the best guide to submission to this will. It is
 indeed a marvelous thing that, during the observance of the ordinance, none
 thinks of harming the Israelite, whether it be his body or his property. It is
 in assurance of the fulfillment of God's saying in Ex. xxxiv. 24: "No man shall
 desire thy land when thou goest up to appear before the Lord thy God." Let the
 Israelite watch over this holy day and cease from all works, in accordance with
 Ex. xii. 16: "And the first day there shall be to you a holy convocation, and
 on the seventh day a holy convocation; no manner of work shall be done in
 them." This command is, of course, to include the Passover and the seventh day,
 which is the first of unleavened bread, "Save that which every man may eat,
 that alone may be done of you." This exception is made, referring to Passover sacrifice
 and its preparation; and whatever may be needed to attend to the same is
 allowable. No other labor is permissible, and the Jewish people are in error in
 their claim, for they have taken this verse as intended for every feast in
 which they allow the cooking of all kinds of food. They have abandoned the
 ordinance, and perform things which are no mentioned in the holy Torah. They
 perform, however, the feast of unleavened bread, but only in part. The Gentiles
 claim that the Jews used blood, human blood, in their unleavened bread, which
 is, I believe, incorrect, and the report of a slaughter, for blood is a
 defiling thing with them as it is with us.<i> And to God belongs the best
 wisdom.</i></p>
 
 <p>   But as to the ordinance of the Passover,
 the Jews have entirely neglected it, although it is an ordinance given to all
 generations forever. Compare Ex. xii. 17: "Ye shall keep this ordinance, for on
 this very day I have brought your hosts out of the land of Egypt. Ye shall
 observe and fulfill this day throughout your generations." Let the reader
 answer, What other day than on the day of Passover did God bring the children
 of Israel out of Egypt? And there can be no greater testimony of this fact than
 this line in Ex. xii. 17: "Ye shall observe this ordinance."</p>
 
 <p>   It is plain enough that the words above
 refer to the Passover, and that all works on that day are unlawful, with the
 exception of the work which concerns the preparation of the Passover. For the
 command as to the prohibition of work on these two days was given before that
 of the Sabbath; and as the praiseworthy and highly exalted God wished to
 arrange for the rest of the annual feasts, he began with the commands
 concerning the feast of the Passover and ended with that of the eighth feast.
 He informed us that the standing of these feasts is as high as that of the
 Sabbath; for he often implied the Sabbath in mentioning the other feast days.
 Compare Lev. xxiii. 2: "The festival days of the Lord, ye shall call
 convocations of holiness, these are festival days." Such saying includes both
 the festival days and the Sabbath, for he has coupled the Sabbath with the
 festival days: "Six days shalt thou do work, but on the Sabbath there is a
 complete cessation of labor, a holy convocation. The least work ye shall not
 do; it is a rest day in your dwellings." The he began mentioning the festival
 days in their order, and in the same manner the Sabbath; and as the Sabbath was
 devoted to God, likewise the rest of the festival days are devoted to him.
 Compare Lev. xxiii. 4: "These are the festival of the Lord which ye shall call
 out in their seasons." Such a line is comprehensive, and the standing of the
 one festival is of equal importance. </p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><i>The Condemnation of a Heresy as to the Use of Fire.</i></p>
 
 <p>   What is wonderful in short-sighted and ignorant
 people who know little of the fullest import of the holy law is, that they
 claim that the feast of the Passover has nothing to do with the Sabbath, and
 does not have the obligations of the Sabbath. Thus one Israelite living outside
 of our own town in the year 1171 of the Hegira[4]
 did adopt a disgusting custom, and resolved upon making fire in his home during
 the festival days, claiming that fire is prohibited only on the Sabbath; as if,
 according to this theory, joy cannot be obtained except by making fire! Such
 persons are indeed ignorant; for, if joy is not obtained except through fire,
 the Sabbath had been worthier, in which the prohibition of fire is commanded.
 These words are taken from the learned sheik Mosallam Almoyan Addanafy, who
 erred therein, for the man who has given birth to such a deed is well nigh
 losing his religion. The reason for prohibiting the making of fire, on this, as
 on other festival days, is, that work need not be necessary. There is no
 exception which permits the making of fire in their homes. And that is why the
 revelation concerning the prohibition of fire was brought down just about the
 time the revelation concerning the building of the Shekinah was brought down.
 Before the apostle Moses (upon whom be peace) had given the tabernacle
 revelation, he gathered the whole people, and made them acquainted with the
 command of God concerning the keeping of the Sabbath and the prohibition of
 fire making. Compare Ex. xxxv. 3: "Do not make any fire in all your dwellings
 on the day of the Sabbath." We know well what is meant by the word "day,"
 namely, "from sunset to sunset." Compare Gen. i, 15; also Lev. xxiii. 32: "From
 sunset to sunset ye shall cease from work." Thus we know that by "day" we
 understand twenty-four hours, without paying attention to those who claim that
 the meaning of the "day" her is intended to imply only the period from sunrise
 to sunset, and excludes the night. After that revelation the apostle gave them
 the instruction concerning the building of the tabernacle. His insistence upon
 the total abstinence from making fire on it should be observed. The man who
 took upon himself the license of making fire upon the festival day was induced
 by his action to commit greater offenses; for, as I have read that this same
 heretic prepared on the festival day coffee for himself and drank it; he also
 smoked tobacco, and as this commodity brought about one of the principal
 confessions, he committed a great offense and transgresses the command of the
 Lord concerning all festival days: "Ye shall not do any work" (Lev. xxiii. 3).
 The action of that man caused them to do exactly what might defile him; for on
 the festival days he visited, and sat in conversation with, people of lewd
 character in cafes and the like, and associated with people who differed with
 him in religion. Like <i>Haggoyim</i> [the Gentiles] and others, instead of
 spending the day in the worship of God, he spent it in idleness, and in
 whatever might change and degrade the character of the day. He made himself
 like the Jews, who may justly be called by the aforesaid name for their deeds.
 All this was contrary to the sayings of God (whose Name is exalted) that on
 such days fulfillment of righteousness must be done. On such days our duties
 must be holy and pure; we must avoid al things that may reflect upon the day,
 and all defilements or anything that may have their shadows. We must be
 occupied in the worship of the exalted God, in reading his law and the like,
 which includes prayer, reading of appropriate portions, etc. This ignorant man,
 however, instead of sanctifying the day, defiled it. The elements of purity
 cannot be harmonized with those of impurity. Let it be known, therefore, that
 God (to whom be praise) prohibited us from doing any work on such days as are
 devoted to him, that he may fulfill righteousness on them by doing whatever is
 pure and holy, and by avoiding whatever may desecrate and defile us, that we
 who keep them may justly fulfill his sayings, "Ye shall be sanctified and be
 holy, for I am holy." Such days must be kept holy, and not defiled with works
 which may keep us away from worship, as is the case on the rest of the common
 days.</p>
 
 <p>   And thou, O ignorant and obstinate man,
 consider what great favor God bestowed upon his people Israel! He made them
 holy, set them apart, and preferred them above the rest, and gave them feasts
 which may claim a divine origin, and for a lawful purpose proceeding from the
 command of the Lord God (who is highly exalted) which sets definitely their
 times and seasons contrary to what may be found in another god. For no other
 god has instituted these festival days, nor is our God their author, but rather
 the god who made these customs is himself made by hands. Woe unto thee if thou
 wilt persist in this obstinacy , and wilt refuse the heritage with which the
 Lord of Creation has endowed thee! Consider also what he has said about thee;
 about thy duty and about thy claim for him concerning the observance of his
 times, Lev. xix. 2: "be ye holy for I am holy, the Lord your God"; also in
 chapter xxvi,: "Be ye holy unto me, I am the Lord God who hath set you apart
 from the nations, that ye may be mine."</p>
 
 <p>   A most surprising thing, indeed, that
 persons who are well acquainted with the purpose of these statements may act
 contrary to them. If the ignorant may say, "I have done nothing; I have done
 only things which are commanded in the law, and if the prohibitions of making
 fire during the festival days were mentioned I would not have made fire," such
 a statement would confirm his ignorance and his persistence therein. For the
 command was not given to prohibit the making of fire, except that no work, not
 even the lest, may be done, and there is no festival day, but a command in
 regard to it was given as follows: "Every work that is to be done thou shalt
 not do." About some of them he gave the following command in Lev. xxiii. 21:
 "Ye shall call on that very day a holy convocation for yourselves. The least
 work ye shall not do. It shall be an ordinance in your dwellings forever and to
 all generations"; and if the festival days had something in addition to the
 days of the Sabbath, this day to which a reference is made by the same verse
 would be the most worthy of all, for God instituted the Sabbath as the day of
 "the short feast," and in that there is no difference between the Sabbath and
 the rest in so far as prohibiting work entirely; for he said about the Sabbath
 in Lev. xxiii. 3: "It is a Sabbath for the Lord in all your dwellings." He also
 said in Lev. xxiii. 21, "An ordinance forever in all your dwellings unto all
 your generations." The reference in the word <i>Moshbotekim</i> is to the
 making of fire, for works may take place either in the dwelling of man or
 outside of it, but the making of fire must necessarily take place within the
 dwelling. "Do not make fire in all your dwellings on the day of the Sabbath."
 In the reference where the word <i>Moshbotekim</i> occurs , it is always given
 before <i>Dorotikim</i>, in order that all generations may know that this
 command has been given them beforehand, handed down from father to son as the
 time goes by; and whenever a new generation rises up, its hoses may be seen
 void of fire on all the festival days, as on the Sabbath. New generations
 should do as those who preceded them in obedience to the command of God in
 Deut. xxxii. 7: "Ask thy father, and he will inform thee; the elders, and they
 will speak unto thee." This is exactly to answer any one who might confide in
 the heresy referred to above, without heeding the righteous truth, and
 following those who preceded him according to what they had handed him and what
 they themselves practiced, believing that his mind and knowledge are better
 than those of his ancestors.  Such
 thinking as this is an additional proof of his stupendous ignorance and lack of
 knowledge, and of the scarcity of his understanding; for we have a proverb
 which runs as follows: "The path of thy forefathers leads thy steps to safety
 and truth." It is also said, "he who follows his own way shall be led astray."
 If that man's mind was sane, others might have followed him, but there was none
 who did so, not even his own wife. Thus he was alone in his belief, and it is
 current among the rest of the nations that the voice of the majority is the
 voice of truth, insomuch that they say, "The voice of the people is the voice
 of God."</p>
 
 <p>   This is indeed the general impression; for
 of the large number of learned teachers who are well known for their
 understanding of the hidden mysteries of the words of the Law, and who have
 left behind them several books, none did presume what this man has affirmed in
 his doings. There were, indeed, men who could support their claims with greater
 logic and in more charming style, but may God forbid that any teacher, whether
 it be in the days of God's favor or in these days of darkness, should do likewise.
 This man was led further by his ignorance, so much so that he set apart the day
 of fasting, from the rest of the festival days, and on it he claimed that that
 no fire should be made. He lied twice in this statement; for he applied to this
 day a statement which was given particularly for the sake of the Sabbath. But
 if it applies to this day, why not to the rest of the festival days, which
 have, on the whole, the same general plan and regulations?</p>
 
 <p>   If one should say that, in regard to the
 past, the Torah has declared <i>Shebet Shebet</i>, namely, "A Sabbath to be
 kept," he could not infer from that fire should not be made therein; for these
 same words were mentioned in reference to the year of rest. Compare Lev. xxv.
 2, "Thou shalt keep a Sabbath unto the land"; and apparently, according to him,
 fire must not be made during the entire year! But, will all that, work was not
 prohibited. May God preserve us from doing after the manner of this ignorant
 heretic, who is trying to establish an ugly heritage. May he protect us from
 committing a similar error, and inspire us always with obedience to him, and
 faithfulness to his worship. May he bring us nearer to his pleasure. Verily he
 is a faithful hearer. May he also bring to guidance this ignorant man, and take
 him off from his folly; for truly he is in the lowest depth of ignorance. May
 he examine his condition, and wake up in his soul, and combat himself and let
 folly alone, and repent of his deed, and return to God, to the supreme and
 exalted God, with a repentance that is pure and unselfish. If he will do this,
 God may return to him, for he is merciful and gracious, for thus he spoke of
 himself to those who may seek him, in Deut. iv. 29: "Return to thy God, and he
 shall not forget thee, nor forget the covenant which he has made with thy
 forefathers."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><i>End of the Condemnation.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Let us now return to what may be said
 concerning the fulfillment of the Passover ordinance. For our words have been,
 so far, quite brief in mentioning the conditions of its fulfillment. </p>
 
 <p>  There remains yet a condition- that the
 eating of the Passover is obligatory upon every Israelite, whether he be
 present or absent, and if he be <i>tameth</i>, namely, "defiled." The eating of
 the unleavened bread must last seven days completely from sunset of the
 fourteenth of the first month; that is, from the beginning of the night of the
 fifteenth till sunset of the twenty-first up till beginning of the night of the
 twenty-second. In accordance with Ex. xii. 17-19, "an eternal ordinance. In the
 first month on the fourteenth day thereof at sunset ye shall eat unleavened
 bread until the twenty-first day of the month at sunset. Ye shall eat seven
 days," namely, seven complete days. This is an eternal ordinance. The
 fulfillment thereof is obligatory; for it is like circumcision; there is no
 escape therefrom. But at the beginning of night of the twenty-second day at
 sunset the end of these seven days is declared without subtraction. And he who
 eats leavened bread in those seven days must perish in accordance with the
 command of God in Ex. xii. 19: "He who shall eat leavened bread shall be cut
 off from the people of Israel whether he be a stranger or a native of the
 land." The destroying of all leavened food in all dwellings of Israel has been
 emphasized again and again even in the places where their works, whether the
 dwelling of man be in a vineyard or in a garden or in a field, even the
 instruments of plowing and planting, must not be defiled therewith, for God
 said in Deut. xvi. 4: "And there shall be no leaven seen with thee in all thy
 borders seven days." Some of our learned men went so far as to prohibit the
 keeping of <i>Burgol</i>, which is wheat boiled and coarsely ground, or even
 bran, or any kind of leaven. They advise that such be taken before the coming
 of the feast and be deposited in the houses of neighbors among <i>Hagoyim</i>
 [the Gentiles], and be returned after the passing of the feast, namely, the
 seven days of unleavened bread. I presume that this advise is due to the
 extremity to which our people may be reduced in destroying all leaven, for they
 indulge in those materials which have been mentioned. They (may God multiply
 them), at the approach of the feast, about the beginning of the first month,
 begin to clean up all their food receptacles by putting a new coat of white
 zinc on their brazen dishes and by buying new implements, such as china dishes
 and ware, glasses, water jars, cups, and water pitchers. They also clean their
 houses both in the interior and exterior. They wash all they have of carpets,
 rugs, counterpanes, and blankets, leaving nothing of household implements that
 may not be washed. All this is done before the arrival of the feast. Still we
 go in this generation to make our Passover in the plains outside of the town on
 Mount Gerizim in the tents. We leave for that place two or three days before
 the feast, and remain there till the second feast, remaining seven days on the
 mountain until morning. We do according to the command given in Deut. xvi. 7,
 8, namely, "In the morning direct thyself, and return to thy dwellings [tents].
 Six days shalt thou eat unleavened food; and on the seventh day there shall be
 a solemn assembly to the Lord thy God. Thou shalt do no manner of work
 therein." And thus we do nowadays to the favor of the exalted God. We pass seven
 days in our tents; and the day of convocation, which is the seventh, we leave
 our tents for the holy dwelling, which is the place of the temple and altar,
 and there we perform our duties; and when the convocation has ended, each
 returns to his tent and attends to his needs. At sunset they gather about the
 high priest, each having in his hand some <i>hachamess</i>, - "unleavened
 bread," -- and the high priest reads, in company with those present, beginning
 with the words, "For in the day of Jehovah," and so on to the end of the surah.</p>
 
 <p>   After this, the surah beginning with the
 words "And the blood was," to the end of that surah. They receive three
 addresses, reciting everything in good order, and then they eat unleavened
 bread. On the morning of the following day they immediately descend the
 mountain, each going to his own business.</p>
 
 <p>   We have been brief in our words, avoiding
 lengthy and tiresome details, but the one who desires to read further
 concerning the subjects may be well satisfied in reading the book called
 "Attabakh," attributed to the learned 
 and wise sheik Hasam Assoory of Tyrus. <i>May God grant him forgiveness,
 and gather us with him in the garden of delight. Amen.</i></p>
 
 <p><i> </i></p>
 
 <p><i>V. THE PASSOVER WHEN THE DATE FALLS ON THE SABBATH.</i></p>
 
 <p>   To the question, Suppose that the Passover
 should fall on the Sabbath, why is it that sacrifices must take place on the
 day Friday after sunset, and what are the reasons therefore? My answer here
 follows.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>   And my success comes from God.</p>
 
 <p>   Praise be to him who is a generous Giver.</p>
 
 <p>   Who directs to the right path,</p>
 
 <p>   Who does according to his own will,</p>
 
 <p>   And as he chooses to do.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>   In answer to this question, namely, of
 offering the sacrifice of the Passover when it falls on the Sabbath, and why we
 are obliges to kill the sacrifice on Friday, I would say, first, that on the
 Sabbath all manner of work is absolutely prohibited, in accordance with the
 words of the decalogue, "Do not do any work on it, for he who does any work on
 it shall die." References of this nature are many in which work is prohibited
 on the Sabbath. On this account our learned men (may the Lord grant them
 forgiveness) inferred that the Passover should be done on Friday, as he said,
 "Do not leave anything of it until the morning." Then he added, "and whatever
 may be left of it until morning ye shall burn with fire"; for this addition is
 surely meant to be performed in case the Passover falls on the Sabbath, for why
 should God repeat in the same line the same prohibition given before? He said,
 also, in another place, in Deut. xvi. 4: "There shall not be left any flesh
 which thou shalt sacrifice on the first day until morning." This, also, would
 indicate to us that the sacrifice would take place only at sunset. It surely
 explains what must be done in case the Passover falls on the Sabbath. For the
 sacrifices then may be eaten on the Sabbath; and should there be left any bones
 or parts of it or flesh, they must all be burned in the night of Sunday. The
 following reference is given in regard to the sacrifice of the Passover when it
 happens on the Sabbath: "On the first month on the fourteenth day of the month,
 between the two evenings, ye shall have the Passover for the Lord" (Lev. xxiii.
 5). Now God did not mention "between the two evenings,' except when he had in
 view the falling of the Passover on the Sabbath. The evenings with us number
 three: first, the going down of the sun in a westerly direction; second, the
 immersion of the disk of the sun into the sea; and, third, the disappearance of
 the redness of the western skies from the sun. Now, whenever the Passover falls
 on the Sabbath, the killing of the sacrifices takes place as the sun goes down,
 that is, after six o'clock of the fourteenth. The ordinance of the Sabbath must
 not be violated; therefore, whatever may be left of the sacrifice is placed
 under watch until the night of the Sabbath after sunset, and should be burned
 then on the altar, in the manner that we have already mentioned. <i>And to God
 belongs the best wisdom.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><i>Mount Gerizim.</i></p>
 
 <p>   A few words affirming that Mount Gerizim is
 the chosen place; and replying to the Jews, who claim that the place was
 intended to be chosen, and was chosen, only at the hand of Solomon; and
 convincing all with testimonies taken from the Law, well known and of legal
 nature, in a brief manner. <i>And to God belongs the best wisdom.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Our opponents claim that the chosen place
 appears only at the hand of Solomon, and that there was no real temple in
 Israel before the time of that king. Thus they attribute to the exalted Creator
 (to whom be praise) but little knowledge of the past and future, for surely he
 could not have known about the chosen place or he would have indicated it to is
 chosen place or he would have indicated it to his chosen, to whom he made great
 revelations. But God is higher, far above these things, for they are
 contradicted strongly by passages of the Law. What otherwise did God mean by
 his command to Abraham (to whom be peace) in Gen. xii. 1: "Now move out of thy
 land, and of the place of thy birth, and of the house of thy father, and into
 the land which I shall reveal unto thee"? Then it is said about Abraham: "And
 Abraham went into the land unto the place of Shechem, unto the plain of Moreh.
 Then the angels of the Lord appeared to him and announced to him the grant of this
 land unto his seed" (ver. 9). From this same chapter we read: "And the angel of
 the Lord appeared unto Abraham and said unto him, To thy seed will I give this
 land." And this took place while our lord Abraham, asking him to sacrifice his
 son, our lord Isaac (upon whom be peace), God's command was given in this
 manner (Gen. xxii. 2): "Take thy only son, Isaac, whom thou lovest, and go with
 him, journeying unto the land of Moreh," etc.</p>
 
 <p>   Now Abraham obeyed the command of the Lord,
 and after his son was redeemed, he said in the same chapter, "God is seen,"
 which is to mean to-day, "in a mountain God is seen," meaning a mountain of God
 answers prayers quickly. This is as much as was said about the mountain in the
 days of our lords Abraham and Isaac (upon whom be peace). Concerning what was
 said about it in the days of our lord Jacob (upon whom be peace), we may write
 that when Jacob went to his uncle Laban, he slept in the chosen place and had a
 dream, in which he saw a ladder reaching the high heavens; and when he arose
 from his sleep he said, "No doubt this is the house of God and the gate of
 heaven" (Gen. xxviii. 17). The he made a vow to God, which was conditional upon
 God's favor and mercy. Compare Gen. xviii. 20-22: "And Jacob vowed a vow,
 saying, If God be with me, and preserve me bread to eat, and clothes to wear,
 and if I return in peace to the house of my father, God will be my master, and
 this stone, which I have set up as a pillar, shall be the house of God. Also
 whatever thou giveth to me I shall surely tithe it for thee." And after his
 return from his uncle's in possession of his desire and fulfillment of his
 purpose which he prayed from his Lord, it is said in Genesis xxxiii. 18, "And
 Jacob entered the city of Nablous [Shechem] in peace." There he fulfilled what
 he had vowed upon himself to the exalted Lord. From these testimonies it became
 plain unto us, and we fully realize that the standing of Mount Gerizim is above
 all others. To it the prayer of Moses refers in his hymn which he sung by the sea
 as in Ex. xv. 17: "Thou shalt bring them, and plant them in the mountain of thy
 inheritance, in the place which the Lord has chosen for his dwelling, which thy
 hand has prepared, O God." Then he prayed for the upbuilding of this place, as,
 in the same verse, we read, "O Lord, build it up by thy might."</p>
 
 <p>   These passages do affirm unto us that there
 was then in existence a chosen place, known to our fathers, Abraham, Isaac and
 Jacob (upon whom be peace). If, however, we should surrender, and say, as our
 opponents do, that our lord Abraham went to Jerusalem, and there he offered his
 son Isaac as a sacrifice; that our lord Isaac slept and dreamed there, and made
 a vow in the same, why was not Jerusalem singled out and made known as a chosen
 place? Why was it left for David and Solomon to discover that their great
 forefathers had been in error in supposing Mount Gerizim to be the real
 sanctuary? Such a belief is faulty, and cannot be trusted by a sane mind,
 namely, that our most high and exalted Jehovah would command his prophets to go
 to places which are unchosen and unknown. God (may his name be praised) is
 above all such insinuations. The Jews err, and God is infallible. So much is
 enough for those who desire the truth, and I pray God for his help in avoiding false
 testimony and fallacious argumentation. <i>Verily he knows the unknown, and
 covers the sins of those who groan from their iniquities.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>VI. THE FORTY YEARS IN THE WILDERNESS.</p>
 
 <p>   I was asked by some, How long did the
 children of Israel remain in the wilderness, and were the forty years solar or
 lunar? Did they offer the Passover sacrifice and eat the unleavened bread, or
 did they not offer the sacrifice of the Passover and eat unleavened bread, or
 did they practice circumcision during their stay in the wilderness, as our
 opponents claim? Did they offer the daily sacrifices or not, and the monthly
 sacrifice, and those of the feast, while they had with them the Shekinah, and
 fire was kept continually on the altar?</p>
 
 <p>   The children of Israel fulfilled all the ordinances
 which they were commanded in the Torah, among them the Passover ordinance, for
 it is one of the greatest ordinances. Our fathers used to perform it according
 to the rules and regulations, and ate it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs
 throughout the forty years. Our opponents claim that our fathers ceased from
 celebrating the Passover during the period of forty years which they spent in
 the wilderness. Against this statement I appeal to God! How could they attend
 to this ordinance while they were in Egypt, surrounded by the most oppressive
 conditions, and then neglect it when they entered the wilderness with perfect
 liberty? How could they cease from performing an ordinance which was given to
 them as long as the world lasts, being at the time in a place where no one
 would oppose them?</p>
 
 <p><i>Cattle for Sacrifice in the Wilderness.</i></p>
 
 <p>   I am asked, Whence did they obtain the
 sacrifices, since they were in the wilderness and had no cattle? Nay, they had
 their cattle with them, and it is the same with which they left Egypt. Compare
 Ex. xii. 38: "Also went with them a mixed multitude, and sheep and oxen and
 cattle in a large number." Of these they used to offer their daily sacrifices,
 and whatever sacrifices were required, according to the times and seasons. They
 made the unleavened bread from the manna which was daily brought down upon
 them, and was their food for a period of forty years. If the opponents say that
 manna cannot be called bread, I will answer that such a name be applied to it,
 for the Lord did so design it before bringing it down to them: "Behold, I am
 raining upon you bread from heaven" (Ex. xvi. 4).</p>
 
 <p>   Now, as to the period of forty years
 complete, I would say that the manna was given them during that period, less
 two months of the first year. And it is said that it did not cease from them
 except when they encamped in the plain of Moreh, by the side of Mount Gerizim.
 The verse "They ate manna until they entered into the boundaries of the Land of
 Canaan" (Ex. xvi. 35), means that the same ceased from being given to them when
 they arrived at the boundaries of the land of Canaan. As the verse "The
 children of Israel ate manna forty years" means the forty years were fulfilled,
 including the month and a half or two which transpired of the first year without
 the manna. On the fifteenth day of the forty-first year, when they began to eat
 of the fruits, the falling of the manna ceased. Then they surely must have
 crossed the Jordan on the tenth of the first month of that year. Which,
 according to tradition, may have been Tuesday, or more accurately Wednesday.
 They stopped in the Gilgal on Thursday, and they ate manna in it, and on Friday
 they went out and gathered three omers of manna for each, which, according to
 our traditions, is due to the fact that the blessed feast of the Passover took
 place in that period. Some of our best chroniclers say that the Passover took
 place on Monday. Thus their first feast in the Holy Land was the Passover, and
 that on Monday, for they ate it of unleavened bread made of the flour of the
 land which they baked; and this is the true version of it, I think.</p>
 
 <p>   Those who claim that those who entered into
 the wilderness or were born during the forty years were not circumcised make a
 terrible mistake. What prohibited them from doing so? For they were commanded
 with this ordinance from the times of our lord Abraham (upon whom be peace).
 They understood how absolute and definite are the punishments of those who do
 not perform it. Passages to that effect are numerous, for whosoever is born
 among the Israelites, and is not circumcised on the eight day, is not counted
 with the people, and that soul is destroyed from the number of its people. What
 our opponents claim in this matter is unacceptable and irrational, and so much
 is enough in this brief treatise. <i>I pray thee, God, for the attainment of my
 desire and the grace of avoiding falsehood and error. Amen, O God, and Amen.</i></p>
 
 <p><i> </i></p>
 
 <p>VII. THE FASTS OF MOSES.</p>
 
 <p>   A question concerning the fasting of our
 lord Moses: Was it forty days during the first fasting, and forty days during
 the second only, or did he undergo three fastings, namely three forties,
 according to what our learned men have informed us? <i>May God's pleasure be
 upon them all.</i></p>
 
 <p>   When did these fastings begin, and when did
 they end? The answer is given through a plain Scriptural statement. <i>And God
 possesses the best knowledge.</i></p>
 
 <p>   The fastings of our lord Moses (may peace
 be his portion) were three in number, each lasting forty days. The first one is
 mentioned in the surah beginning with <i>Alah-Alai-Haharah,</i> where, in Ex.
 xxiv. 18, we read: "And Moses was on the mountain forty days and forty nights."
 Now when Moses (upon whom be peace) departed from the presence of God, and went
 down and saw what the people were doing, and beheld that accursed calf, with
 that frightful scene around it, he throw the two tablets from his hand and
 broke them at the base of the mountain, doing what we read was done with the
 worshippers of the calf, for God destroyed them in that time. Thus we read in
 Ex. xxxii, 30, 31: And in the morning Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned
 a great sin, and I am about to ascend before God and pray, and perhaps I will
 intercede for your sins; therefore Moses returned to God." There he fasted for
 the second time forty days, while interceding for the people, until God had
 accepted his prayers and had forgiven the people. We know this from Deut. ix.
 18: "Then I prayed before Jehovah, as before, and during forty days and forty
 nights I neither ate bread nor drank water, because of your sins which ye have
 committed to do the evil thing before Jehovah to offend him." </p>
 
 <p>   We know, besides, that God commanded him to
 make two other tablets like the first one and commanded him to engrave them, as
 it is revealed in Ex. xxxiv. 1: "Jehovah said unto Moses, Hew thee two tablets
 of stone like the two first ones," etc. And in the second line of the same
 chapter we read: "And be ye ready in the morning, and ascend in the morning
 unto Mount Sinai." It is well known that this command of God (may his name be
 praised) was given after the second fasting of forty days. Compare Deut. x. 1:
 "At that time Jehovah said unto me, Hew thee two tables of stone like unto the
 first." Moses hewed unto himself the second two stone tablets on that day, and
 on the following he went with them up into the mountain, for we read in Ex.
 xxxiv. 2: "And be ye ready in the morning, and go up in the morning to Mount
 Sinai, and stand there before me upon the top of the mountain. Let no man go up
 with thee."</p>
 
 <p>   While on this mountain he fasted forty days
 for the third time. For we read in the same chapter, namely, Ex, xxxiv. 27028:
 "And Jehovah said unto Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of
 these words I have made a covenant with thee and with Israel. And he was there
 with Jehovah forty days and forty nights; he did neither eat bread, nor drink
 water. And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten
 commandments." It is known, also, which the Torah, that the first fasting of
 the apostle Moses (may the peace of God be upon him) began on Friday, which is
 known with us as the day <i>Kohleh-Ha-Ibrim</i> ("the gathering of Hebrews");
 for on Monday God commanded him in Ex. xix. 10-11, "And Jevovah said unto
 Moses, Go unto the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-marrow, and let them
 wash their clothes. And be ready against the third day; for the third day
 Jovovah will come down in the sight of all the people upon Mount Sinai." The
 third day would be Wednesday, which is with us the Pentecost day, and on that
 day the righteous God (may he be praised) uttered the ten commandments, which
 day became with them a great day, whose importance has kept well known until
 our days. It is named "the Day of Mekratah." On the selfsame day Moses
 pronounced, in the hearing of the people, the ten commandments, as stated in
 Ex. xix. 25: "So Moses went down unto the people, and spoke unto them." He gave
 them an exposition of God's statues and what God had addressed to him, for we
 read in Exodus, "Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob and announce to the
 children of Israel"; and we read also: "And Moses came and explained to the
 people all the commandments of the Lord and his statues." He also did what is
 given in Ex. xxiv. 4: "And Moses wrote all the words of Jehovah, and rose up early
 in the morning, and builded an altar under the hill, and twelve pillars,
 according to the twelve tribes of Israel." And that morning was the morning of
 the fifth day, which was Thursday, as mentioned by the learned doctor Sadakah
 in his exposition book. On that day they offered sacrifices upon the altar, and
 what Moses has written of the commands of God was read to them.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>VIII.  THE WRITING OF
 THE COMMANDMENTS.</p>
 
 <p>   We have been asked, What was the use of
 writing the commandments of God and reading them to the people after the people
 had been addressed directly with them, and after they had answered, "All the
 words which Jehovah hath said will we do" (Ex. xxiv. 3)?</p>
 
 <p>   The answer is like this: A man will agree
 with another upon some thing. He writes first the agreement and reads it to
 him. The second party agrees or disagrees to the agreement, and that is why the
 people answered, "We will do," in Hebrew, <i>Nesheh</i>. They said the second
 time, "We shall obey and do," equivalent to <i>Nechmoa Unecheh</i> in Hebrew.
 And when the young man of Israel had killed the offering of oxen upon the altar
 which the apostle had built, the latter took the blood, and put half of it in
 basins, and the other half he sprinkled on the altar; but the half which was
 kept in the basin he sprinkled over the children of Israel. Thus the blood fell
 upon their clothing and the ten commandments <i>Eshret Hadebarim</i> were
 inscribed upon the people according as they were heard from the mouth of the
 Almighty God, who made a covenant with them, according to Ex. xxiv. 8: "And he
 said, Behold the blood of the covenant which Jehovah has made with you
 concerning all these words." In another place, namely, Ex. xxxiv. 27, we read:
 "According to the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee and
 with Israel." This covenant was made with them, that they might not commit any
 transgression in the commandments of the High God (whose name is exalted). It
 is the fourth commandment of the seven which God had made with the children of
 Israel. <i>And God knows best, and to him belongs the best wisdom.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Now, after the fulfillment of all these
 things, God said, in Ex. xxiv. 12:<i> Elah, Elai Haharah</i>, namely, "Come up
 to me to the mountain." This, therefore, according to the revelation, was on
 Friday, upon which his first fastings took place. On the morning of the
 forty-first day he descended the mountain, and found what the people had done
 in reference to the calf, and took the same, and burned it on that very day. It
 is well known what he did on that day. On the following morning he returned to
 the mountain to intercede for the people and for their transgressions, as we
 have already stated. He remained there fasting for forty days, and on the
 fulfillment of the forty days he descended, and hewed out the two tablets on
 the day of his descent. On the morning he returned and ascended the mountain,
 to obtain the writing upon the second two tablets. Compare Ex. xxxiv. 2: "And
 be ready by the morning, and come up by the morning to Mount Sinai." Thus the
 whole period previous to this amounted to eighty-two days. After he had fasted
 another forty days, the period totaled one hundred and twenty-two days, the
 period totaled one hundred and twenty-two days plus the day on which he
 descended. Now, as four days had proceeded, namely, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday,
 and Thursday, and as doubtless one day or two were omitted from one month, the
 descent of the apostle Moses (upon whom may be the best peace), after the end
 of the third forty days, was, in all probability, on the morning of the ninth
 day of the seventh month, that is, on the day known with us as <i>Teshet Iomey
 Hateshobah</i>, that is, "the nine days of repentance."</p>
 
 <p>   On that day Moses commanded the people to
 fast on the tenth of the seventh month, known with them as "the day of the
 great atonement," in Hebrew <i>Iom Hakeforim</i>. This is in accordance with
 what our learned doctor of blessed memory, Sadakah, has said. This account
 would be true if the third month had fallen on Monday. If it had fallen on the
 Sabbath, then the omission of only one day in the four months we have mentioned
 could have taken place, for it is impossible that four months should occur
 without the omission of a single day, as our learned men claim that the new
 moon of the first month which the Passover was celebrated in Egypt took place
 on Thursday. This is quite proved. Thus, following in the least these accounts,
 we would think that one month in these six months had been omitted; and it is
 said that the six days which are mentioned in Ex. xxiv. 16, "And a cloud
 covered it for six days," were included in the fasting of the apostle Moses in
 his first fasting. <i>And God has the best knowledge of all these things.</i> </p>
 
 <p>   This is what my tired understanding and
 weak mind have been able to record concerning this question, and I pray God for
 forgiveness if any addition or subtraction has been made.</p>
