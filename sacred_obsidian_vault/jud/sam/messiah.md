 <p>   The 
 Samaritan priests, appreciating the interest of American and European 
 Christians, are now willing to sell to them accurate modern copies of the 
 ancient books of the Samaritan religion. I think it well, however, to warn 
 intending purchasers, that not all the copies offered for sale, even in Nablus, 
 are accurate. Some people of little learning, relying on the ignorance of 
 tourists, have made garbled copies of our Torah, and have sold them to tourists 
 or correspondents. Manuscripts purchased at our Synagogue, from myself or my 
 sons will be certified as complete and correct. Several recent purchasers have 
 sent their manuscripts to me for inspection, and I have been sorry not to be 
 able to certify to their correctness. It grieves us to have our Law incorrectly 
 copied. I request my friend, Dr. Barton, to make this statement to intending 
 purchasers. We desire that such copies of our sacred books, as go forth into 
 Christian libraries shall be accurate. Any manuscript purchased in our 
 Synagogue, and bearing my seal, is genuine and complete.</p>

 <p>THE 
 MESSIANIC HOPE OF THE SAMARITANS.</p>
 <p>INTRODUCTION.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>I COUNT it no small 
 honor that I am permitted to introduce to American and English readers the 
 author of the following little treatise, Jacob, Son of Aaron, High Priest of the 
 Samaritans. Through him the hope of ages utters its voice in expectation of a 
 Messiah still to come. So far as I know the messianic hope of this ancient and 
 almost forgotten sect has never before been set forth with authority and 
 completeness in a modern tongue.</p>
 <p>   The High 
 Priest lives at Nablus, the modern Shechem, at the foot of his sacred mountain, 
 Gerizim. Jerusalem has been destroyed again and again, and its name almost 
 forgotten; but this little sect still clings to its holy mountain, and speaks 
 its unheeded message in a strange language and to a world that has almost 
 forgotten the existence of this ancient and now diminutive congregation.</p>
 <p>   A few 
 years ago it was my privilege to visit the Samaritan colony at Shechem, and to 
 establish an acquaintance with the High Priest out of which has grown an 
 interesting correspondence.</p>
 <p>   In 
 January 1906, I learned from Mr. E.K. Warren, who had visited Jerusalem as 
 chairman of the World's Sunday School Convention in 1904, that some 
 correspondents of his had discovered what they believed was an independent 
 source of information concerning the life of our Lord. The letter which he 
 showed me read in part as follows: </p>
 <p>   "It seems 
 to me we have made a discovery which will greatly interest you. The Samaritans 
 have a genealogy of their high priests, which I have never heard has been 
 translated. Each high priest notes what during his priestly office occurs of 
 note. One of these high priests speaks of `Jesus the Son of Mary' being born, 
 and another of his being crucified during his term. I have secured an Arabic 
 hand-written transcript of this record and their history, which, with the 
 translation of those passages into English, we are sending under separate cover 
 to you." (page 
 2)</p>
 <p>   I at once 
 wrote to the High Priest, who wrote me under date of February 28, 1906:</p>
 <p>   "I have 
 received your letter, and the explanation which you require about the genealogy 
 of the priests, and the information (photo with caption: 
 `Jacob, son of Aaron, High Priest of the Samaritans.') about Jesus Christ 
 and his crucifixion. It is found with us. We gathered the information from 
 various historians and papers which were with us of very ancient date. These 
 were written by priests (page 3) long 
 before our time. The ancient papers were sold to a learned Jew about 35 years 
 ago. The name of the Jew was Abraham of the Museum of the Russians. He bought 
 all the papers which were with us, and we have not one of those papers now. But 
 before those papers were sold I gathered the history from those papers of 
 ancient date. The history as now written includes the history of our 
 congregation and all that happened to us from the day we entered the Holy Land 
 to the present time. If you wish one of those histories, I will send it. It will 
 be useful to you." (photo with caption: 
 `high priest and the Holy scroll of Nablous.') </p>
 <p>   Meantime 
 Mr. Warren received a copy of the book from his correspondents in Jerusalem. It 
 was a manuscript volume of 494 pages in Arabic, with a tabular supplement of 13 
 pages. Later word was received that the High Priest's cousin Isaac had a copy of 
 a part of the chronicle, one leaf of which was sent to him for examination, and 
 by him forwarded to me. It was on very old parchment, 8 x 12 inches. The book 
 contained 15 such leaves, and one other, (page 4) the 
 first one, in paper; the original first leaf having been worn out. For this 
 chronicle he wanted 200 pounds sterling.</p>
 <p>   Prof. 
 Abdullah Ben Kori of Pacific University examined the book, and reported its 
 contents. It proved to be the Samaritan Chronicle of Abulfath, compiled about 
 1355 A.D. (756 of the Hegira), and brought down to date. The work of Abulfath 
 was edited by Edward Vilmar and published in Gotha in Arabic, in 1865. The 
 narrative ends with the reign of Haroun-al-Raschid. This chronicle the High 
 Priest had taken, and from the records and traditions of his ancestors, the 
 priests of the Samaritans, had brought the chronicle down to date. (photo with caption: `A 
 village Fountain') Before I had determined the precise character of the 
 book, I had secured a translation of those portions relating to Jesus, and had 
 discovered that they were, in their present form, not earlier than the period of 
 the Crusades. Their references to Jesus are here given:</p>
 <p><i>About the Birth of 
 Jesus, the Son of Joseph the Carpenter.</i></p>
 <p>   "In the 
 days of the high-priesthood of Yahokeem, who was high priest for about 
 thirty-two years, occurred the birth of Jesus, son of (page 5) Joseph 
 the carpenter, of the sect of the Jews: hence the date from our ancestor Adam 
 (to whom be peace) to the appearance of the son of Mary, 4290 years, and from 
 the commencement of Fansota to the birth of the said Jesus, the son of Mary, 
 1236. And his birth took place in Bethlehem, and his resort was to Nazareth, and 
 many of the sect of the Jews were gathered to him, until his chief men were from 
 among them. And the Jews hated him with bitter hatred, and sought in every way 
 to slay him, because they claimed that his works were contrary to the law of 
 their religion, and opposed to the traditions of their elders in every matter. 
 And when he had gathered apostles, he delegated them to various countries. Among 
 (photo with 
 caption: `Department store at Nablous.') these, Peter was sent to Rome 
 and Andrew to the Soudan, Matthew accompanying him. This Matthew wrote a Gospel; 
 (this word is Greek2 and signifies "good 
 news"). This Matthew wrote his Gospel in the year 41 after the death of Jesus, 
 and it is said that he wrote it in Judea. Thomas was sent to Babylon, and Philip 
 to Kerwan, and Africa, and Paul to Eliya, and its neighborhood. This Paul (page 6) wrote a 
 number of epistles which the Christians have. And he at first was called Saul, 
 and it is said that he was born in Tarsus, capital of Cilicia. It is said he 
 belonged to the tribe of Benjamin, but more truly he belongs to the tribe of 
 Judah. He wrote fourteen epistles. Before he wrote these he sent an epistle to 
 Salonica in the year 52 after the slaying of Jesus, the son of Mary: the last 
 was the second epistle to the people of Timothy in the fifty-sixth year after 
 the slaying of Jesus. And Simon was sent to the country of Barbary. And the said 
 Jesus had other disciples than these, among whom was Mark, who also wrote a 
 gospel, and of whom it was said that he was a disciple of Peter. It is said that 
 he wrote his (photo with caption: 
 `Plows in the Valley of Shechem') Gospel at the dictation of peter to the 
 people of Rome. It is said that he wrote his Gospel forty-eight years after the 
 death of his master Peter. Among the others there was Luke, who was from the 
 city of Anitoch and Sabius, practicing medicine; and it was said that he was 
 originally a heathen. After he became a Christian it is said that he became a 
 disciple of Paul. It was said that he wrote his Gospel in Boeotia, which is a 
 state in Greece, and its king was Tabis Cade. Among the others was John, who was 
 from Bethsaida, a town of Galilee. He was the son of Zebedee and Salome. He was 
 (page 7) in 
 his youth a fisherman, and Jesus ordained him as an apostle. He also wrote a 
 Gospel in the year 101 after the death of Jesus, but more correctly in the year 
 97 after the slaying of Jesus. Because he reached the age of 115. And it is said 
 that he wrote a part of his Gospel in the island of Patmos, and part after his 
 return from there, in Ephesus: and he continued at the writing of his Gospel 
 from the year 64 to the year 97 after the slaying of Jesus..........</p>
 <p>   "To 
 return to the subject of Jesus, the son of Mary, whom the sect of Jews, his 
 relatives, accounted an illegitimate son of Joseph the carpenter; Herod the king 
 sought to slay him, and he fled from (photo with caption: 
 `Children near Shechem.") his hands and was a fugitive from him and from 
 his relatives the Jews. At this time the High Priest Yahokeem[3] died, in the mercy of God, and was succeeded by the High Priest Jonathan, who 
 held the office twenty-seven years. In his day Jesus, the son of Mary, was 
 crucified by the Emperor Tiberius. With him were crucified two sinners, who 
 according to the law of the Jews, were worthy of death. One of them was 
 crucified on his right, and the (page 8) other on 
 his left, and this was in the Jebusite city of Aelia,[4] through the instrumentality of Pilateh who ruled over the sect of the Jews. </p>
 <p>   "This 
 Jesus never molested the Samaritans, all the days of his life; neither were the 
 Samaritans concerned with him or molested (photo with caption: 
 `Mother and Child.') him. But he was a plague to his relatives and his 
 co-religionists, from whom he sprang. These are the sect of the Jews who hated 
 him with a bitter hatred. (page 9)</p>
 <p>   "The Jews 
 were also the cause of the death of John, a disciple of the same Jesus; and they 
 deceived Herod through the means of a young maiden, whom they presented to him 
 for his pleasure. And when she found out that said King Herod was dead in love 
 with her and her beauty, and was inclined to her, it was not difficult for her; 
 and he beheaded said John. Said Herod was at Sabaste at that time. The reason 
 for him naming him John the Baptist was that originally the Jews believed in his 
 being righteous, and believed on him, and were also baptized of him; but stopped 
 doing so when they saw that he was a lover of Jesus, son of Mary. Because they 
 asked John not to baptize Jesus; but he took him to Jericho and baptized him 
 there; for the Jews believed that any one who was baptized in those waters was 
 freed from all their uncleanliness and sins. Since that time baptism was 
 changed, and taken up by the Christians and refused by the Jews; and the Jews 
 instituted in its place to pass through the waters of the Jordan, believing 
 whoever did so would be cleansed from their sins. But when the Christian kings 
 came into power, they forbade them from doing that."</p>
 <p>   While 
 this evidently possessed no value as a source of information concerning the 
 events of our Lord's life, it seemed to me to have interest as an 
 interpretation. And it caused me to question the High Priest farther as to his 
 view of the person of Christ, and his hope of a Christ to come. He wrote me in 
 answer:</p>
 <p>   "Concerning your question about Christ who has come and the Christ who is 
 to come, I have sent you a long epistle. I trust in God it will reach you and 
 that you will be pleased with it."</p>
 <p>   The 
 document is a manuscript booklet of 21 pages written in Arabic, with Scripture 
 quotations in Samaritan Hebrew and in red ink. Prof. Ben Kori has translated it 
 very faithfully, bringing to the work a very accurate knowledge of the Arabic. I 
 preface it with further word about its author taken from near the end of the 
 chronicle above referred to, when it begins with the death of his uncle and 
 predecessor, and his own induction to the priesthood:</p>
 <p>   "In the 
 year 1292 (i.e., 1874 A.D.) in the beginning of the year, in the days of the 
 High Priest Omran, on the night of Friday of the month of Moharem, the days of 
 his priesthood came to an end, and he died, to the mercy of God. And he left 
 Isaac and Salaam his sons: and he also His Excellency, his nephew Jacob, the son 
 of his brother, who succeeded him in the priesthood and commandery. And Jacob, 
 the aforesaid High Priest, who can trace his generation to antiquity, acquired 
 great respect from the Mohammedan government, and from the children of his own 
 people; may God multiply (page 10, Photo with 
 caption: `Samaritan Pentateuch and Genesis. Owned by Dr. Wm. E. Barton.') (page 
 11.) their like. And he became perfect in his personality, and through 
 the good counsels by which he became the highest of his people. And there is 
 none who would oppose him in significant title of his priesthood. May God 
 lengthen his honorable existence. His is great ability in writing Hebrew and 
 Arabic; and he is very zealous upon the enemies of his religion. Amen. To him 
 belong several Hebrew compositions, and also a book containing ten chapters 
 concerning the origin of the Samaritan people and their customs and their 
 religion. And he is the man who gathered the various portions of this history; 
 for he is the foremost of his age and time. And may God be exalted, and lengthen 
 the days of his honorable existence. Amen."</p>
 <p>   It is 
 evident that this little treatise raises as many questions as it answers. We 
 cannot help wondering whether the Messiah of the Samaritans is to be a prophet 
 and only a prophet. The High Priest speaks throughout of a Second Kingdom, but 
 gives no hint as to whether the Messiah is to be a king. Apparently his office 
 is to be prophetic and spiritual; and the political offices of the kingdom may 
 be discharged by others. Of this we may not be to sure; and fortunately we shall 
 be able to secure the information at first hand, and will await further 
 information from the High Priest himself.</p>
 <p>   Also we 
 wonder whether the Messiah is to be a priest; and whether the sacrifices are 
 considered prophetic of his coming, and are to be discontinued at his appearing. 
 And we shall be glad to know what is to become of other nations and religions. 
 We will inquire of the High Priest; but meantime here is the little treatise as 
 we sent it. An interesting piece of rabbinical logic it is; and one which cannot 
 fail to be suggestive to American and English readers.</p>

 <p>THE CHRIST WHOM THE SAMARITANS

 <p>IN THE NAME OF THE MOST MERCIFUL

 <p>     Praise be to the powerful King, the Omniscient, the Conqueror, the One 
 who chose Israel and conferred honor upon (photo of written letter

 revealed the truth to all creation through his apostle Moses, son of Amram, upon 
 him and his righteous fathers, each and all, the best of peace! (page 13)</p>
 <p>   As the 
 minds of the majority of this our generation are not able to undertake a 
 detailed research after most of the truths that are in the Torah, on account of 
 hindrances and other life relations, (photo with caption: 
 `The High Priest at the time of Prayer.) one whose requests are binding 
 on me and whom I would respect by obliging him to the utmost of my power, 
 requested me to write down for him some statements in proof of the Second 
 Kingdom. (page 
 14) To this request I gave an affirmative answer and composed, 
 accordingly, this essay; in order that men's minds may become prepared for the 
 triumph and the vanquishing of evil and adversity. I pray God, in the meanwhile, 
 for success; verily He hears and answers. Amen.</p>
 <p>   The 
 reference concerning the establishment of the Second Kingdom, affirming the 
 appearance of "THBH" or a Prophet at the end of time of whose appearance we have 
 a promise, is found in Ex. xx, (photo with caption: 
 `Samaritan High Priest reciting history of the first Passover. Exodus XXII. On 
 Top of Mt. Gerizim, Passover celebration of 1906.) in the last verses, 
 which are not found in the Torah of the Jews. It reads, "They said well. Let 
 their consciences uphold my fear, and the keeping of my commandments, all the 
 time: so that it may be done well unto them and their children. I shall set up 
 for them a prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee, and I shall put my 
 words into his mouth and he shall speak to them all that I command him. And it 
 shall be that the man who harkens not to the words which he speaks, I shall make 
 him thereto responsible." These words concern the prophet in whose coming we 
 believe. (page 
 15) Again, "The prophet who dares to address words in my name and speaks 
 what I have not commanded him, and he that speaks in the name of foreign gods 
 shall be killed." The same is stated again in Deuteronomy, as also one may find 
 in the Torah of the Jews, Deut. xviii. 15.</p>
 <p>   Now, 
 proofs concerning the Prophet and his coming amount to ten in the holy Torah, 
 and they are given in the way of symbols.</p>
 <p>   A part of 
 the first proof is denoted in the meaning of the sleep that fell upon Abraham in 
 Gen. xv. 17, beginning with "<i>Wa iehi hashemesh</i>," i.e. "and the sun was." 
 The second part consists in the fact that when our lord Abraham was assured of 
 God's promise to him, given in the chapter beginning with <i>Achar haddebarim 
 haelleh,"</i> i.e., "After these things," as follows: "Look up toward heaven and 
 count the stars, if thou be able to count them;" and He added: "thus shall thy 
 seed be." I say when this assurance was given him, he wanted to know whether or 
 not their kingdom and the fulfillment of the covenant rested on conditions. He 
 desired to find out the order of events; and hence his question given in the 
 same chapter, verse 8: "Whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it?" God (who 
 is exalted) knowing Abraham's purpose and the aim of his question, informed him 
 that the kingdom and the fulfillment of the covenant rested on certain 
 conditions: therefore He said to him (in the same chapter, verse 9): "Take me a 
 heifer of three years old, a she-goat of three years old, a ram of three years 
 old, etc." He also informed him of the manner of offering them. Concerning the 
 beasts it is said: "He divided through," just as it has been revealed unto Moses 
 (upon him be peace) in the first chapter and twelfth verse of the book of 
 Leviticus, as follows: "And he shall cut it according to its pieces." Referring 
 to the birds, Gen. xv. 11 says: "He divided not," just as one reads in Lev. 1. 
 17: "And he shall rend it between its wings but clear through." Herein 
 indications are given as to what is fit for sacrifice offerings. In the word 
 <i>meshulleshet</i>, we understand that peace offerings are to be divided into 
 three parts: (a) God's part or portion, as it is indicated; (b) The high 
 priest's portion, consisting of the heave thigh and wave breast; (c) Israel's 
 portion, consisting of the remainder. Now, allusion is made to the first kingdom 
 in the section beginning with "<i>Haiah hashemesh</i>." First in verse 12: "And 
 they will enslave them and oppress them for four hundred years," down to and 
 including verse 14, "And after that they shall go out with much wealth." Here he 
 was informed that their servitude during these years and what would transpire 
 for and against them (page 16) will 
 not come about in his days; for we read in the same chapter, verse 15: "But thou 
 shalt go to thy fathers in peace, and thou shalt be buried in a good old age." 
 When He was through these informations concerning the first kingdom, as to how 
 it would begin and ho He would hide his pleasure and how the truth would be 
 falsified- Compare "And the sun had disappeared," meaning of course, His 
 pleasure, and "Darkness came,"</p>
 <p>That is erring away- he included those concerning the 
 reappearance of his pleasure and the (Photo with caption: 
 Samaritans prostrating themselves in Prayer. On top of Mount Gerizim, Passover 
 celebration of 1906.) beginning of the second kingdom. God assured that 
 to him with a firm covenant, saying (xv. 18): "In that day God made a covenant 
 with Abraham, saying, To thy seed will I give this land, from the river of Egypt 
 as far as the great river, the Euphrates river." By this he was referring to the 
 second kingdom, for the Jews did not possess that territory during the first 
 kingdom. Concerning the passage, "And behold a smoking furnace and a sheet of 
 fire," we (page 
 17) shall give a later explanation, in its proper place. Now, the 
 scattered mention of "Seven nations" refers to those whom God had destroyed 
 before Israel, and whose lands He caused Israel to possess. But we have here a 
 mention of eleven nations. They are those whose lands Israel shall possess in 
 the second kingdom, from the river of Egypt as far as the great river, the river 
 Euphrates, and as far as the far sea. Here ends the first proof.</p>
 <p>   The 
 second consists in that to which Jacob called the attention of his sons, in 
 Chapter IX. Jacob (may peace be his lot) had, indeed, included in his sayings 
 some subtle meanings. He said: "gather yourselves," referring to the first 
 kingdom and Israel's gathering and coming out of Egypt. He referred, also, to 
 its wandering away and the evil consequences resulting therefrom; for in the 
 same chapter and verse, he says: "And I will inform you as to what shall befall 
 you in the latter days." Even our lord Moses, the apostle (may peace be upon 
 him), said in Deut. iii. 29: "And evil shall befall  you in the latter days." Such days are 
 the days of error. But these will disappear and be displaced by those of his 
 pleasure and the return of the kingdom, in reference to the words, "Gather 
 yourselves." Such is affirmed by God (who is exalted) in the holy book, in Deut. 
 xxx. 4: "From thence will IHVH, thy god, gather thee and from thence will he 
 fetch thee." But this will take place only when perfect obedience is assured and 
 conditions of repentance are fulfilled. We pray the Lord (who is exalted) for 
 success in our affairs. May He mend our doings and bring us to the days of his 
 pleasure, when the Shekinah will appear. Verily He is able to dispose of 
 everything He will.</p>
 <p>    The 
 third proof is found in connection with the hand of the apostle Moses (upon him 
 be peace), and with its change to whiteness and return to its first state. The 
 meaning is that He (who is exalted) indicated thereby to the apostle that the 
 truth will appear at his hand, and then it will disappear. His hand was, 
 therefore, designated as "leprous," and "as white as snow," referring to purity. 
 The word <i>Mesoraat</i> reminds us of the days of error. <i>Kashaleg</i> would 
 indicate that though error is prevailing and God's pleasure is taken away, there 
 would remain a portion that would cling to the law, believe in its truthfulness, 
 obtaining thus care from God for the purpose of preserving his covenant, 
 according as we find the word of God in Lev. xxvi, 42: "I shall remember my 
 covenant with Jacob and I shall remember my covenant also with Isaac and my 
 covenant with Abraham." Also the passage in the same chapter beginning with 
 verse 44: "But still, though they are (page 18) in the 
 land of their enemies," etc. That these conditions are to disappear and the 
 return of God's pleasure is to follow, is illustrated by the fact that the 
 apostle's hand assumed its former state; for in the book of Exodus iv. 7 we 
 read: "Behold it became again like his flesh." This agrees fully with the 
 promise: "But I will remember, in their favor, the covenant of their ancestors." 
 What would prove, moreover, the days of error, is the passage in the same 
 chapter, verse 43: "And the land shall be deserted by them," i.e., it shall be 
 empty of them. Their return and the restoration of their kingdom is affirmed 
 thus: "I will remember the covenants of their <i>(</i>photo with caption: 
 "Jacob's Well") ancestors, in their favor." That the kingdom shall be 
 lasting is indicated by the passage: "That I may be their God, I am the Lord:" 
 for God (who is exalted) is eternal with no change (may His highness be 
 exalted!).</p>
 <p>   The 
 fourth argument consists of a part of the parable of Balaam in Numbers xxiv. 17: 
 "A star shall come out of Jacob and a rod shall rise out of Israel," to "the 
 sons of uproar." Herein certain characteristics of the first kingdom are 
 mentioned. We are informed, also, that such a kingdom was removed from Israel to 
 Esau (see verse 18): "And Edom shall be a possession;" then it (page 19) shall 
 be handed to Esau, then to Ishmael by way of inheritance, in accordance with the 
 verse: "And Esau shall be an inheritance to his enemies." Thus by the end of the 
 kingdom of "Ishmael," "Ieshrael" shall reign. Thus we read later: "And Israel 
 shall act valiantly," referring to its victory, as we read in verse 19: "And the 
 one, who is from Jacob, shall have dominion," i.e., shall have the rulership. 
 All such is firmly proved, and God knows best all matters.</p>
 <p>   The fifth 
 proof is found in the section beginning with: "If ye shall bring forth 
 children." This section is divided in three stages. The first stage refers to 
 the days of rebellion and the loss of the kingdom and the disappearance of the 
 Shekinah, (compare Deut. iv. 25) : "And ye shall corrupt yourselves," etc. The 
 second concerns the necessity of repentance and God's satisfaction that its 
 conditions have been fulfilled, (compare verse 29 of the same chapter): "Then if 
 thou shalt seek," etc. The third deals with God's return to them with his 
 pleasure, with rulership and kind doings. Compare verse 31: "For the Lord thy 
 God is a merciful God," etc.</p>
 <p>   The sixth 
 proof is derived from the disasters that would befall the enemy. Says Deut. 
 xxix. 22, "And the last generation shall say," down to "They shall see the 
 plagues of the land," including "And no grass shall grow therein." The 
 references to the places which are the object of God's displeasure, are 
 sufficient to convict of error those of Israel who have strayed from the truth. 
 Deut xxix. 24 says: "All nations shall say, why hath God done thus unto this 
 land?" and they shall confess their error and their forsaking the truth and 
 their continued lethargy in falsehood, and it shall be answered as in verse 25: 
 "because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, the God of their fathers, which 
 He made with them, when He brought them out of the land of Egypt." Also verse 
 27: "Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against that land." Those who 
 will say these words are the faithful to the law of truth, and this will take 
 place when the truth shall appear. Its appearance will have its signs, just as 
 the appearance of falsehood has its own signs: and all will be recorded in its 
 own place.</p>
 <p>   The 
 seventh proof is discerned in the noted section beginning with, "And then all 
 these things are come upon thee," designating thereby that, at the end of the 
 days of falsehood, minds will be rectified, religions purified, good doings 
 practiced and impurities washed away. With all these things, perfection is, 
 however, to be obtained from God (whose is might and glory). Compare Deut. xxx. 
 6: "And the Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed, 
 that thou mayest love the Lord thy God," etc. (page 20) Then 
 they shall come up and rule the land and truth shall triumph. Compare verse 3: 
 "And the Lord thy God will return, `with' thy <i>repentance,[5] </i>Also as far as "More than thy fathers."</p>
 <p>   The eight 
 proof is found in the section beginning with, "Give ear." Deut. xxxiii. 22 says: 
 "A fire is kindled in my anger and it burns to the lowest pit." This is given 
 after the extreme rebellion of Israel has been related, compare verse 24: "They 
 have moved me to jealously with that which no God; they have provoked me (photo with caption: 
 `Joseph's Tomb and Mount Ebal.') with their vanities." Next to these 
 words we read: "But I will move them to jealousy with those that are not a 
 people; with a foolish nation will I provoke them." After that, the holy of 
 holies of the enemy will be disgraced and truth eill be triumphant; that is 
 <i>Bethiahweh, har Gerizim, Bethel</i>. Israel will have the kingdom: "I became 
 kindled in the fire of my anger," etc., as far as "It is the fire that will 
 burn," <i>Migdash Zerutah</i>. Compare verse 22: "It will eat up the land and 
 its produces." It is the fire concerning which (page 21) we read 
 xxix. 23: "All its land is burning; it shall not be sown nor shall it bear," 
 etc.</p>
 <p>   What 
 would also prove the second kingdom is Gen. xv. 17: "And behold a smoking 
 furnace and a fire torch." Thus would show that the triumph of truth will 
 proceed from God (who is exalted and honored) in having the form of these two 
 symbols. The fire of the one will descend upon <i>Al migdash-Zerutah</i>, the 
 other will descend upon <i>Al har Gerizim</i> in order to purify it of the 
 defilements of those who accept another sanctuary instead of it. Then will truth 
 triumph and the kingdom be restored. Compare Deut. xxxii, 22: "It shall lick the 
 foundations of the mountains." It is the fire (Photo with caption: 
 `Valley of Sychar and Ancient Tomb.) that will descend upon Mount 
 Gerizim. Do you not see that when <i>Migdash Zerutah</i> were mentioned, the 
 word <i>Tokel</i> was used, meaning annihilation; while with the mention of 
 <i>Gerizim</i>, the word is <i>Telahet?</i> This distinctly means, "It will 
 lick," that is, it will purify but not annihilate. The latter is used in the 
 same meaning as <i>Tahiru bash, </i>ye shall pass in fire, referring to 
 purification. We have, indeed, two consecutive expressions that have nearly the 
 same meaning; but God knows best! The use of <i>Gerizim</i> in plural is out of 
 respect to it, and it should be, therefore, elliptically understood in the 
 expression: "It will lick the traces of the mountains." (page 
 22)</p>
 <p>   The 
 ninth proof is found in the section beginning with "<i>Zoth habberaka</i>," 
 i.e., "This is the blessing," in Deut. xxxiii. 4, which is: "They are sitting at 
 thy feet and receiving thy words," etc. The reference is about the seed of our 
 lord Abraham, namely, the children of Esau and of Ishmael, whom God invited, in 
 the day of gathering, to enter into his service to keep the law. Compare verse 2 
 of the same chapter: "And shone from Seir unto them," referring to the children 
 of Esau, in harmony with Gen. xxxvi. 8: :And Esau dwelt in Mount Seir." Compare 
 also Deut. xxxiii. 2: "And he glimmered from the mountain of Paran," meaning the 
 children of Ishmael, in harmony with Gen. xxi. 21: "And he (Ishmael) dwelt in 
 the wilderness of Paran." Thus, from these plain references one can not doubt 
 that truth will appear in favor of Israel, through the fact that these nations 
 shall return to its religion, though they had already refused, as it is without 
 doubt, to enter its religion and to submit to its laws. But God (who is exalted) 
 has informed us that they will submit themselves to the Law, for we read in 
 Deut. xxxiii. 4: "They are sitting at thy feet and receiving thy words." This, 
 however, will take place when God's pleasure shall be restored; when the clouds 
 shall alight upon the Shekinah, in the house of God, on mount Gerizim. This is 
 in fulfillment of Ex. xv. 17: "Thus, O God, hast made a sanctuary: O Lord build 
 it up with thy might by the ever presence of the Shekinah and of offerings."[6] The ever presence of the Shekinah is linked with God's eternity, as the next 
 verse indicates: "The Lord will reign for ever and ever." They will say, 
 "<i>Torah asher sy-wah lanu Mosheh,</i>" i.e., "The law which Moses commanded 
 us," thereby confessing the veracity of the prophecy of our lord Moses (upon him 
 be peace); that he was sent for the sake of the truth to the whole world. They 
 will also concede that God (may He be exalted) brought down the Law upon Israel, 
 and thereby honored Israel above all nations and made him the prince of the 
 whole world; for it is said in Deut. xxxiii. 4: a possession of the people of 
 Jacob." May God, who is exalted, bring the time near by His might and will. 
 AMEN, LORD, AMEN!</p>
 <p>   The 
 tenth proof is contained in chapter 34 of Deuteronomy, beginning with: "And 
 Moses went up from Arabat Moab." Here said in Exodus xxxiv. 10: "I will perform 
 miracles with thee," etc. It is: "And the Lord showed him all the land" down to 
 "As far as the great sea," and "To thy seed will I give," referring to the 
 children of Moses (upon him be peace). This was not exclusive: The (page 23) mention 
 of the fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob (upon them be peace) has already 
 preceded. They were the people of the covenant, oath and promise for giving the 
 land to their seed, and it is the twelve tribes that came out of the lions of 
 Jacob. Therefore in saying to the apostle Moses (upon him be peace): "This is 
 the land I swore to thy fathers to give to their seed," He meant that to each of 
 them He made an oath. For example, He said to Abraham in Gen xii. 7: "To thy 
 seed will I give this land." To Isaac He said in xxvi. 3 of the same book: "To 
 thee and thy seed will I give those lands." And to Jacob He said in the same 
 book (xxxv. 12): "And the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac, to thee I give; 
 to thy seed give I the land."</p>
 <p>   We 
 have proved the establishment of the kingdom, its restoration and the 
 reappearance of the Shekinah and its duration; but the things that are hidden 
 belong to the Lord, our God, and those that are revealed are for ourselves and 
 children.</p>
 <p>   As 
 to the appearance and coming of the lord Christ, recorded in our chronicles, we 
 regard its validity not from the viewpoint of our law, but as a matter of 
 history. As to the Messiah, with whose coming we are promised, there are proofs 
 and demonstrations in regard to his coming. As our learned men have explained in 
 their voluminous commentaries, he will rise and perform miracles and 
 demonstrations; he will uphold religion and justice. Among other proofs he will 
 produce the following three:</p>
 <p>1.       The reproduction of the ark of testimony, which is the greatest 
 attestation for Israel. For Deut. xxix. 29 says: "It shall be there FOR THEE as a 
 witness." This upholds strongly the veracity of our Torah; it has only 
 twenty-two letters, in harmony with the numerical value of "B" and "K,"[7] with no addition or retraction, and not as the Jews pretend, for their version 
 possesses twenty-eight letters.</p>
 <p>2.       He will produce, at his hand, the staff which was given 
 by the Creator (who is exalted) to our lord Moses (upon him be peace), about 
 whose attribute a reference is made as follows: "And this shall be to thee as a 
 sign," in order that miracles be performed thereby.</p>
 <p>3.       He must produce the omer of manna which our fathers ate, 
 while in the wilderness, for forty years. This is the greatest proof, because, 
 after all this period, it will be found to have undergone not the slightest 
 change. When our ancestors, in the days when manna used to fall, would keep some 
 of it till the marrow, it would become rotten and wormy. Therefore, it would be 
 a proof none could deny (page 24) (photo with 
 caption: `Chart of the Tabernacle in the wilderness. With symbols of the temple 
 furniture to be restored by the Messiah, as illustrated on the case of the Holy 
 Scroll. From a drawing by the High Priest.) (page 25) if it should appear 
 sound after this long interval, and remain in its sound state. Thus the people 
 of the second kingdom might see it, and confess reverently and increase in 
 exalting and glorifying the Creator (who is exalted), for the power of producing 
 such a marvel.</p>
 <p>   These three proofs must be verified by the Prophet; and without them his 
 claim would be considered illegal. No matter could ever be sustained unless with 
 two or three testimonies, in accordance with the saying of the holy Law: "Upon 
 the testimony of two or three witnesses a matter is sustained." Without such 
 proof he has no standing.</p>
 <p>   But 
 how many have appeared and claimed the prophecy through signs and dreams, 
 against whom the Law has warned us? Read: "If there arise in thy midst a prophet 
 or a dreamer of dreams, and if he give thee a sign or miracle, and if the sign 
 or miracle whereof he spoke unto thee take place, and then say unto thee, Come 
 let us follow other unknown gods and worship them: listen not to the words of 
 that prophet or dreamer of that dream." The foregoing is found in Deuteronomy 
 xiii. 1. Verse 6 of the same chapter says: "If thy brother, the son of thy 
 father or the son of thy mother, or thy daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or 
 thy friend, who is as thyself, would entice thee, saying: Come, let us worship 
 other gods, that are unknown to thee and to thy fathers, from the nations that 
 are around thee, whether near or far away from thee, thou shalt not listen," 
 etc.</p>
 <p>   Testimonies similar to the foregoing are many in the Torah of the law, 
 that is, the Old Testament, and so much is enough concerning this question.</p>
 <p><i>   This is all that my frail mind could suggest for this essay; and God 
 knows best!</i> (Writing in Arabic and a seal mark in Arabic.) (page26)</p>

 <p>FURTHER COMMENTS OF THE SAMARITAN HIGH 
 PRIEST.</p>
 <p>COMMUNICATED BY WILLIAM E. 
 BARTON, D.D.</p>
 <p> </p>
 <p>   The 
 treatise of the Samaritan High Priest 
 on "The Messianic Hope of the Samaritans" was submitted to the author, and it 
 reached him at the time of the Passover on the top of Mt. Gerizim. It was read 
 to him and he heard it with approval, but in comment on the footnote at the 
 bottom of page 8, he explained that the name Aelia, given to Jerusalem after its 
 destruction, is not used (Photo 
 with caption: `Ruin of temple on the top of Mt. Gerizim.) by the Samaritans for the city itself, but 
 denotes a village near the present site of Jerusalem, the spot where Eli set up 
 his tabernacle. He adds that the place now called Shiloh, near Sinjil, which 
 Christians suppose to have been the Shiloh of Eli and Samuel, was not the real 
 Shiloh. The High Priest then proceeds to answer the questions asked him 
 concerning the Messiah.</p>
 <p>   In the little treatise the Messiah 
 was depicted as a prophet. But the Christian messiah is spoken of as "Prophet, 
 Priest and King." It seemed an interesting question whether the Messiah 
 of (page 27) the Samaritans were to 
 be more than a prophet. The High Priest answers this 
 inquiry:</p>
 <p>   "There is nothing in prophecy to 
 say whether he will be of the priestly line or not. Some of our learned men say 
 he will come from the children of Aaron, and be a priest. Others say that he 
 will be of the children of Joseph, and `like unto his brethren.' My own private 
 opinion is that he will be of the children of Joseph."</p>
 <p>   Of course the Samaritan hope is 
 not colored by any of the Jewish memories of the throne of David, and the 
 treatise gave no (Photo 
 with caption: `Samaritan High Priest and His family.) hint as to any kingly rule. Asked concerning 
 this, the High Priest answers: </p>
 <p>   "The Messiah will be a prophet, 
 and will be acknowledged as a prophet. That will be his title, as the prophecies 
 give it. But he will also be a king."</p>
 <p>   The High Priest was asked 
 concerning two or three Old Testament passages frequently quoted as Messianic. 
 He replies:</p>
 <p>   "The promise that the seed of the 
 woman shall bruise the serpent's head, in Genesis iii, 15, has no Messianic 
 significance whatever. It has a very long interpretation, but the substance is 
 this: (page 28) </p>
 <p>   "The serpent has intruded upon 
 man, and the man who seeks revenge upon the serpent does so with much advantage 
 yet with peril. He will have his heel bruised, but ultimately will overcome the 
 serpent and kill it."</p>
 <p>   "Of course the serpent is only a 
 serpent."</p>
 <p>   "While there is some difference of 
 opinion about Gen. xlix. 55, which tells at what time the scepter shall depart 
 from Judah, there (photo 
 with caption: Crypt of old Crusaders' church showing Jacob's well.) is light to be found in the form of the name 
 Shiloh. The Jews make it two words, but in the Samaritan Torah it is but one 
 word, and that is the name Solomon. The characteristics which Jacob attributes 
 to Shiloh belong very well to the character of Solomon. For he it was who set up 
 idolatry in Jerusalem that he might please his heathen wives; and further built 
 there the temple for the pretended ark, as I have told in another place. Then it 
 was (page 
 29) that the scepter departed 
 from Judah, and under his son Rehoboam, though he came back to the true capital, 
 Shechem, to be anointed king, the true Israel revolted, and set up the kingdom 
 in Shechem where it belonged, and the scepter departed from 
 Judah."</p>
 <p>   To Christians it will be 
 interesting to know whether the Samaritan Messiah is expected to be in any sense 
 divine. The High Priest answers: (photo with caption: Jacob's well showing ruins of the old Crusaders' church.) 
 </p>
 <p>   The Messiah will not be in any 
 sense a Son of God. He will be prophet like Moses and like his brethren, as it 
 is told in Deut. xviii, 15-22:</p>
 <p>   "'The Lord thy God will raise up 
 unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto 
 him ye shall hearken; according to all that thou desiredst of the Lord thy God 
 in Horeb in the day of the assembling, saying, Let me not hear again the 
 (page 
 30) voice of the Lord my God, 
 neither let me see this great fire any more, that I die not. And the Lord said 
 unto me, they have well said that which they have spoken. I will raise them up a 
 prophet from among their brethren, like unto thee; and I will put my words in 
 his mouth, and he shall speak unto them all that I shall command him. And it 
 shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall 
 speak in my name, I will require it of him. But the prophet, which shall speak a 
 word presumptuously in my name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that 
 shall speak in the name of other gods, that same prophet shall die. And 
 (photo 
 with caption: Old olive grove outside Nablous.) if thou say in thine heart, How shall we 
 know the word which the Lord hath spoken? When a prophet speaketh in the name of 
 the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the ting which the 
 Lord hath not spoken: the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously, thou shalt not 
 be afraid of him.'</p>
 <p>   "This is the passage of the Torah 
 which tells us what the Messiah will be, and I hope you will read it with clear 
 eye, as you always read everything."</p>
 <p>   Another thing was asked of the 
 High Priest, namely, what (page 
 31) would be the attitude of the 
 Messiah toward Christians and other nations. He answers:</p>
 <p>   The Messiah will be a prophet, as 
 I have told you, and will no doubt work signs to prove his mission. There will 
 be unusual signs and wonders, which I described in the little book. But he is to 
 be a king, and rule the earth from Shechem, the ancient seat of power, and from 
 his holy mountain, Gerizim. He will call all the world to acknowledge him, and 
 will do so. He will bring blessings to all nations that acknowledge him." 
 (photo 
 with caption: View from High Priest's House. (The rock of Jotham is seen on the 
 hill above.) </p>
 <p>   Still one thing was asked the High 
 Priest as he sat in his tent while the fires were heating the ovens for the 
 sacrifice of the lambs for the Passover, Will the Passover continue after the 
 Messiah comes? </p>
 <p>   He answered:</p>
 <p>   "The Passover will continue after 
 the Messiah comes. It is a perpetual feast. It has no reference whatever to the 
 Messiah."</p>
 <p>   I am sure that these answers will 
 be interesting to very many readers of the little treatise already printed. 
 (page 
 32)</p>
 <p>   The priest wishes also that a word 
 be inserted cautioning Americans and Englishmen who buy manuscripts in the 
 Samaritan tongue that it is not safe to buy them except at the Samaritan 
 synagogue; as the demand for them has led unauthorized persons to make incorrect 
 copies, some of which have come to him to be authenticated; and he finds them 
 imperfect, and some of them fraudulent. The synagogue is very glad to sell 
 copies of the Pentateuch and of their other books. The copies which they have 
 for sale are of course modern copies made by the priests and authenticated. It 
 is to be hoped that the oldest manuscript will not pass from the (photo 
 with caption: Samaritan synagogue with ancient Pentateuch on the chair.) 
 possession of the Samaritan 
 community. This, their greatest treasure, held in most holy veneration, should 
 not depart from its historic home in the bare little synagogue at the base of 
 Mount Gerizim so long as the Samaritan community exists.</p>
 <p>   The oldest of the Samaritan 
 manuscripts, and that from which all the others are derived, is believed by many 
 scholars to be as old as the Christian era, and is generally conceded to be the 
 oldest manuscript of the Bible in the world. Strange as it may seem, our Old 
 Testament manuscripts are much less ancient than those of the New. There are 
 three New Testament manuscripts which date (page 
 33) from 300 to 450 A.D., - the 
 Alexandrian, known as Codex A, in the British Museum; the Vatican, known as 
 Codex B, which is in the Vatican at Rome; and the Sinaitic, known as Codex 
 Aleph, which is treasured at St. Petersburg. One of these is in possession of 
 the Greek Church, another of the Roman, and the other of the Protestants, which 
 illustrates the dependence of all sects in Christendom on the same things and on 
 each other. But the Old Testament manuscripts we have none in Hebrew going back 
 of the tenth century. The Samaritans have one nearly a millennium 
 older!</p>
 <p>   Five years ago I saw this oldest 
 manuscript. The High Priest stood guard over it, and one of his sons exhibited 
 the next oldest roll which on all ordinary occasions is shown in place of the 
 oldest one. The ancient one is supposed to be shown to the Samaritans once a 
 year only, on the day of Atonement, and never to outsiders. Most travelers who 
 suppose themselves to have seen it have seen only the substitute. The original 
 is written on a yellow parchment, not brown or white, without ruled lines, and 
 the writing is smaller and less regular than in the substitute. The ordinary ink 
 of the Samaritans is dense black and glossy, but this is purple. It has been 
 re-inked in many places. At least a third of it has cracked way, for it is very 
 brittle, the black is reinforced by other parchment, and the missing portions 
 have been supplied. It is many years since it has been unrolled, and the High 
 Priest writes that to unroll it would be to injure if not destroy it. He is 
 willing to consider the question of photographing such pages as can be exposed 
 without endangering the parchment, but not the entire work. The old book is kept 
 under lock and key, and covered with rich green cloth.</p>
 <p>   I have what may possibly be a 
 fragment of that old codex. I obtained it from a son of the High Priest as a 
 premium with a larger purchase. No Samaritan, I hope has yet reached a depth of 
 depravity which have lead him to mutilate that book for money, but in many 
 places bits have been worn out of it, and this is such a scrap, five and one 
 half by three and one half inches from the lowest margin of the manuscript, and 
 containing Genesis xxvi, 20-22. The letters are small and irregular; it has been 
 re-inked at least twice in places; the lines are not ruled; the parchment is 
 yellow and brittle and wrinkled; and above all, the ink, which is so faded and 
 over-written that it would be difficult to tell from the front of the leather 
 what was the original color, has stained the back of the parchment a distinct 
 purple. If it is true as Deutsch affirms, that (page 
 34) "the ink is black in all 
 cases except the scroll at Nablous," then I may not be counted over-credulous in 
 thinking the relic I obtained (photo 
 with caption: view near Nablous.) from the young priest Abalhassan as being of 
 distinct interest among literary treasures. (page 
 35)</p>
 <p>   Pictures of the Samaritan 
 Pentateuch are not rare, though in almost every case it is the substitute roll 
 that has been photographed. They give a good general idea of the appearance of 
 the Holy Scroll. The case is of silver, as large as a stove-pipe, cut lengthwise 
 into three sections, and with two sets of hinges at the back, so that it will 
 (photo 
 with caption: High Priest with ancient Pentateuch manuscript.) open and show a column of text, or close and 
 protect all from the light. At the top are three large knobs, the middle one a 
 dummy and the two end ones rollers by which the parchment is rolled forward or 
 back. The case inside is about eighteen inches high; but the knobs above and the 
 legs below make the entire height about (page 
 36) thirty inches. The five 
 books of Moses, which are all the Bible which the Samaritans receive, are 
 written on the hair side of skins of lambs offered in sacrifice. The entire roll 
 is probable sixty or more feet in length. I presume no one knows how long it is, 
 though Condor was told that it contains twenty-four skins. As a Hebrew 
 Pentateuch which I brought in Jerusalem has fifty-two skins, and another on 
 exhibition at the St. Louis Fair (which I also bought) has more, I think 
 Condor's estimate too low.</p>
 <p>   The Samaritan colony now is very 
 small and poor. There were 152 of them in 1901, 97 males and only 55 females. 
 While this is a greater number than that of the passengers of the Mayflower, and 
 their descendants now are legion, there is little prospect that the Samaritans 
 will leave such a posterity. They expect to be brought practically to 
 extinction, but to be restored when their Messiah comes.</p>
 <p>   So far as the treatise indicates, 
 the Samaritans do not look for any vicarious sacrifice on the part of their 
 Messiah. His career, when he comes, would appear to be one of victory and 
 tranquil rule, primarily religious, but with some political significance. The 
 sacrifices are declared not to be prophetic of his mission. The passages quoted 
 by Christians from the Pentateuch as messianic are held not to refer to him. 
 Practically the whole content of Samaritan messianic prophecy appears to be 
 derived from Deut. xviii. 15-22, in which the Messiah is a prophet like unto 
 Moses, raised up from among the people, and one of their own brethren.
