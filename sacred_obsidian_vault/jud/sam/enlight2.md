 <p>IX.  THE REVELATION
 OF THE TORAH.</p>
 
 <p>   I have been asked by some concerning the
 noble Torah, as to the time of its revelation, and whether it was revealed all
 at once, or at different times according to the events. What Biblical
 explanations could be given which are of a convincing nature?</p>
 
 <p>   Let it be known unto thee, O questioner,
 that the holy Torah was revealed in one roll by the supreme righteous God,
 written in the handwriting of the Almighty, in characters that are well known,
 containing all the verses and divisions and commands and prohibitions and
 explanations and other knowledge from the very beginning to the end. This is
 according to what our most learned high priest Hasam Assoory of Tyrus has
 written in his book, known as the book of "Tabach."  They err, those among our people (whom may God diminish) claiming
 that the commandments of the Torah and its prohibitions were addressed to the
 apostle Moses (upon whom be peace), who wrote them down himself. Now their
 claim is wrong, from various points of view. </p>
 
 <p>   Take, for instance, the question of the
 manna. It was given to the people on the sixteenth day of the second month of
 the first year of their departure from Egypt, and continued to be given unto
 them while they were in the wilderness for a period of forty years, both solar
 and lunar, until they arrived in the land of Canaan. Compare Ex. xvi. 35: "And
 the children of Israel ate the manna for forty years, until they arrived at the
 borders of Canaan." Consider, for instance, the question of sprinkling the
 water which he commanded to be done in the ninth day of the first month of the
 second year of their departure from Egypt. Examples of this nature can be
 multiplied. Thus it is plain that the apostle Moses (upon whom be peace)
 received delivered unto him all the Torah written in all perfection. Of this
 there are various proofs.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>   First. God does not create anything unless
 he provides for its necessity and usefulness. To verify my statement concerning
 Torah, I will begin citing Ex. xxiv. 12, "Ascend unto me to the mountain, and
 be there: and I will give thee the two tablets, and the law and the
 commandments, which I have written down for their instruction." The words "the
 law" and "the commandments" refer to the roll of the Law, which is the Torah,
 without the least doubt. We can prove that this one referrer to is found in the
 same book, chapter xxxii. 32, "otherwise bolt me out from thy roll which thou
 hast written." The word <i>Sepher,</i> means "roll" wherever it is found,
 although some interpreters render it by the word "book."</p>
 
 <p>   Second. That the Torah was revealed and
 came down completely in one roll is proved by the fact that it mentions events
 before their happening. Compare, for instance, what God has said concerning the
 river which comes out of the garden and which divides into four parts. The
 first part surrounds the land of "Hewilah," which is Egypt. The second
 surrounds the land of the Soudan. The third is that which runs east of the land
 of Mosul. The fourth is the Euphrates. This statement was given in the
 beginning of creation, before the existence of either Egypt or Soudan or any
 other country. Then when God created Eve out of the rib of our father Adam
 (upon whom be peace), he said in Gen. xxiv. 29: "Therefore shall a man leave
 his father and mother, and cleave unto his wife." Then there were neither
 father nor mother and none but Adam and Eve, and this was the first commandment
 given unto the seed of Adam.</p>
 
 <p>   Third. What was meant by the reference to
 the age of Moses, the son of Amram, in Genesis, "And his days shall be one
 hundred and twenty years"?</p>
 
 <p>   Fourth. The statement concerning the
 daughters of Lot, wherein it was said, about the first, "And the oldest gave
 birth to a son whom she called Moab, and he is the father of Moab unto this
 day"; and of the second, "And the younger gave birth to a son whom she called
 Ben-Ammi, and he is the father of the children of Ammon unto this day" (Gen.
 xix. 37-38). Now the saying "unto this day" is to mean that the same could be
 applied to the end of generations.</p>
 
 <p>   Fifth. The report of God of the death of
 our lord Isaac (upon whom be peace) which should have been given after the
 story of out lord Joseph (upon whom be peace), for the death of Isaac took
 place after Joseph had passed twelve years in Egypt.</p>
 
 <p>   Sixth. We can find proof in Gen. xxxvi. 31,
 where it is said: "These are the kings which reigned in Edom, before there
 reigned a king of the children of Israel." The names of the kings are there
 given, and the last king was Hadad. He was the same king concerning whom verse
 14 of chapter xx. Of Numbers is given: "And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh
 to the king of Edom," who was really Hadad, in accordance with the instructions
 of our learned men. For in Lev. xxxvi. All the kings were said to have died,
 with the exception of the last one, whose death was not mentioned, and who did
 not die until after the children of Israel had possessed the land. Besides,
 everything that was mentioned in the first book, which was Genesis, took place
 before the time of Moses (upon whom be peace).</p>
 
 <p>  
 Seventh. The question of Manna is another proof. It was sent down on the
 sixteenth day of the second month. The statement which reads, "And the children
 of Israel ate the manna to the end," was given at the beginning of the fortieth
 year; and if the Torah had not descended upon Moses in one single year, this
 statement would not have been written down at the end of the fortieth year.</p>
 
 <p>   Eighth. God said that there should be a
 place of refuge for a man who has killed another man unknowingly, and that the
 refugee should remain in the place until the death of the high priest. Now this
 statement was written at the end of the fourth book, and these places were to
 be established after the conquest of the holy land. We find it, however,
 mentioned in the second book, which is Exodus, in the surah beginning with
 chapter xxi., verse 7. Read, therefore, verse 13, "Make therefore a place of
 refuge for him, that he may flee thereto." This statement was given at the
 beginning of the fortieth year, but the children of Israel had no high priest,
 nor had they the order of the priesthood. Similar examples might be cited to
 prove our point.</p>
 
 <p>   Now, as to those who claim that the Torah
 was given piece by piece in accordance with the events that happened, then it
 must have descended on several prophets, beginning with our lord Adam, the
 father of all mankind (upon whom be peace), and ending with the last, who is
 Joshua; for the Torah closes with Moses (may peace be his portion), and the
 installment of Joshua, his successor (upon whom be peace). Now, if any one
 should say, "Every prophet wrote the happenings of his days during his
 lifetime, and the same was done by our lord Moses, who wrote everything in the
 Law" this supposition is liable to faults and exaggerations, and Moses could
 not help writing down every statement of the least portion of the contents of
 the Torah. Supposing that this is true, who, then, wrote the account of the
 tower of Babel and what happened to its builders? Surely they did not do it!
 Who wrote the affair of the daughters of Lot? For their father knew nothing of
 it, as we read in Gen. xix. 33-35, proving his entire innocence. Surely it
 could not be true that the daughters themselves reported it! And who might have
 informed us of the affair of Tamar, the daughter-in-law of Judah? She surely
 would not have reported the truth. And then, again, during the life of Moses,
 who was present with Balak and Balaam, who may be considered worthy of belief,
 that he might inform Moses of the same; that the latter might write it down as
 the Torah gives it in detail, and also concerning the ass of Balaam and the
 language which he spoke? God indeed understands all languages. He knows what is
 visible and invisible. I suppose the speech of the ass was in the same language
 which was understood by the people of that land, namely, Hebrew.</p>
 
 <p>   We know, also, that the Torah was given in
 one single roll by reading and understanding its contents; for, if it had been
 given in accordance with the progress of the events as they happened, it would
 have been written in the style of a history. But the style is indeed quite
 different. The visit of Jethro to his brother-in-law, that is, to Moses was
 mentioned, as well as the advice he gave to our lord Moses (upon whom be peace)
 in Ex. xviii. The account concludes with verse 27, "And Moses sent his
 father-in-law, and he went to his land"; but the exact date of the departure of
 Jethro is given in Numbers, just on the day the people of Israel left Mount
 Sinai. Chapter x. 29 says: "And Moses said to Hobab, the son of Raguel, the
 father-in-law of Moses (for Jethro was called also Hobab), We are about to
 leave."</p>
 
 <p>   In Exodus the erecting of the tabernacle on
 the first day of the first month of the second year of the departure of the
 children of Israel from Egypt was mentioned (read Ex. xvi. 33). From these we
 know that the tabernacle was erected and finished on the first month of the
 second year, and on the first day of the month. We know also, that whenever the
 cloud disappeared from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel would move
 onward, and this was the uniform beginning of their journeys. So much only is
 said, but what has been said is again affirmed in Lev. i. 1, "And Jehovah
 called out Moses, and spoke to him out of the tabernacle of the congregation,
 saying," etc. But after the end of the third book and whatever it contained of
 meanings and advice, Numbers, which is the fourth book, takes up the same
 question again. It begins: "And Jehovah spake unto Moses in the wilderness of
 Sinai, in the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the second
 month of the second year after their departure from the land of Egypt, saying,
 Count up the congregation of the children of Israel," etc., which is plain
 enough. Therefore, it must be understood that one month after the erection of
 the tabernacle, God commanded that the children of Israel be numbered, that the
 census be taken of the tribes of the children of Israel. But nearly one fourth
 of the book may be read before the question of the completion of the erection
 of the tabernacle is taken up, in chapter vii. In the first verse, which reads:
 "And it came to pass on the day when Moses had fully set up the tabernacle, and
 had anointed it and sanctified it," etc. Now if the events should have been consecutively
 mentioned in accordance with their time order, this surah and all that follows
 it as far as chapter ix., verse 15, which reads: "And in the day of the
 erection of the tabernacle," etc., should either begin the book of Leviticus or
 be an end to the book of Exodus.</p>
 
 <p>   Also the surah beginning with Num. vi. 22,
 which reads: "And Jehovah spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto Aaron and unto
 his sons, saying, In this way ye shall bless the children of Israel, saying
 unto them, Jehovah bless thee, and keep thee," etc., should have come before
 the surah mentioned in Lev. ix.22, which reads: "Then Aaron lifted up his hands
 towards the people, and blessed them," etc. The command of the blessing is
 given in Num. vi. 22, while the fulfillment of it is previously mentioned in
 Lev. ix. 22. While the blessing takes place, the water of consecration should
 be sprinkled over the people, which was the part of Mishael and Elzaphan when
 they picked up Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, and moved them when they
 were dead. Thus they were defiled with the defilement of the dead person.
 Therefore God commanded that this water of consecration be instituted on their
 account. This was on the eighth day of consecration, but the preparation of the
 water of consecration took place on the ninth day of the first month of the
 second year of their departure from the land of Egypt, but the purification of
 Elzaphan and Mishael must have taken place only on the night of the fifteenth
 day of the month, which is the night of the Passover, and they could not
 perform the Passover nor eat it on account of the pollution, therefore God
 commanded the doing of the second Passover on their account. To prove this we
 sill state that ever since God commanded that the Passover should be performed
 on the night of the fifteenth of the first month of the second year, this has
 been so done. So he made plain statements in regard to the second Passover, in
 Num. ix. 6 and the following verses, during that year to be performed for the
 benefit of the polluted man, which, according to our learned doctor, were the
 above mentioning events without regard to their chronological order. Examples
 of this nature are many, and we do not intend to mention them, for we believe
 if the apostle Moses (upon whom be peace) had written down the events as they
 transpired, a due attention would have been given to chronological order.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><i>Concerning Specific Records Made by Moses.</i></p>
 
 <p>   If one should ask, How could you explain
 Ex. xii. 14? The answer is, God commanded Moses (upon whom be peace) to write
 the memorial of the blotting out of the Amalekites, and read the same to Joshua
 (upon whom be peace), to acquaint him with it, although the learned high priest
 Sadakah, of blessed memory, wrote in regard to this roll, which is mentioned in
 the afore said verse, that Moses had it to remind him of events which he would
 copy into the Torah when later he compiled the complete work. This statement of
 the high priest will be refuted later on.</p>
 
 <p>   Now the meaning of this verse is the same
 as that found in Ex. xxiv. 4, namely, "Moses wrote down all the words of God";
 and verse 7 reads: "And Moses took the roll of the covenant, and read it in the
 hearing of the people." In the same manner we read Num. v. 23.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><i>The Cases where Moses was in Uncertainty concerning the
 Divine Will.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Now if one should say, Granting that the
 apostle Moses (upon whom be peace) received the whole Torah, containing all the
 events, why is it that in Lev. xxiv. 12 we find Moses somewhat undecided as to
 the case of the son of Shelomith when he blasphemed the name of Jehovah,
 namely, that Moses put this man in prison until Jehovah should reveal unto them
 his will? Again, in ix. 7 when he was asked, Why should we cease from offering
 to God sacrifices in their season? He answered in the following verse, "Wait
 until I hear what Jehovah shall command unto you." Again, when they found a man
 cutting wood on the Sabbath, and brought him before the apostle Moses, he said
 in Num. xv. 34: "let him be kept under guard until it may be known what must be
 done with him." And nothing was done until an answer was returned, as the holy
 Torah asserts.</p>
 
 <p>   When the apostle Moses (upon whom be peace)
 received the roll, he placed it in his tent, as it is mentioned in Ex. xxxiii.
 7: "And Moses removed the tent, and erected it outside of the encampment." In
 the beginning of the month he received a command from God to read the Torah,
 and to write a copy of it as it is written in Deut. i. 3: "In the fortieth
 year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month," etc. And then
 verse 5, "Moses had begun to copy this law." He used to be judge of Israel
 during those forty years, as we read in Ex. xviii. 16: "I judge between man and
 man, and acquaint them with the commandments of God and his laws." Whenever he
 met with difficulties he used to have recourse to God for enlightenment, lest
 false judgments might be rendered. For he was far above false judgments. As to
 the time when he received the roll, according to the most learned man, the
 relative of ours, the one of blessed memory, Hasam Assoory of Tyrus, in his
 book called "Attabakh," the roll was given to Moses at the end of his forty
 days' fast, when he received the two tablets which were later on dashed to
 pieces. My opinion, and I pray God for forgiveness if I am mistaken, is that
 Moses received it at the end of his second forty days' fast; for in his first
 fast he received the first two tablets; and during his second fast he received
 the roll of the law; and during his third forty days' fast he received the second
 two tablets. This conclusion may be reached from the wording of the law. <i>And
 God possesses the best knowledge.</i> </p>
 
 <p>   It was for this roll that our lord Moses
 removed his tent outside of the encampment, and placed in it the roll, the tent
 being called the "meeting tent." Our lord Joshua was its guard, keeping it in
 this tent in accordance with Ex. xxxiii. 2, where we read: "And his servant
 Joshua Ben Nun did not go out of the middle of the tent." Do you not see that
 the apostle took him in his company during the first forty days' fast, as we
 read in Ex. xxiv. 13: "And Moses and his servant Joshua arose and ascended to
 the mountain of God," etc.? During the second forty days, Joshua remained at
 the base of the mountain, gathering his food of the manna, until the descent of
 Moses with the two tablets. What proves that Joshua remained throughout all
 those days at the foot of the mountain is found in EX. xxxii. 17; for, when the
 apostle Moses descended with the two tablets after his fast of forty days, we
 read: "And Joshua heard the voice of the people in shouting, and he said to
 Moses, There must be a war cry in the encampment." If he had been present among
 the people he would not have said this in an inquiring manner.</p>
 
 <p>   During the second forty days' fast Joshua
 did not accompany Moses, nor did anybody else; for we read in Ex. xxxiv. 3:
 "Let no man go up with thee."</p>
 
 <p>   If any one should ask why the high priest
 Merkah, of blessed memory, said in reference to the Decalogue, "And he wrote of
 them five writings," the meaning is, that the Decalogue includes in its
 explanation the whole Torah. And he who desires to investigate further may look
 up the commentary of the law written by Aben Hajar, and that of the high priest
 Merkah, which possess full explanations as to the meaning of the various
 readings of the law. He declares likewise that the Torah descended as a whole
 from before the presence of God, written by the very hand of the Almighty, and
 handed down to his apostle Moses Ben Amram (upon whom may be the best of regard).
 Therefore, as can be seen from several passages chosen from his writings, and
 from the writings of our crowned poet, our lord Moses Ben Amram received the
 Torah in one roll containing all the ordinances, commandments, and
 prohibitions, all the news and teachings, which are attributed to have come
 from God, and which therefore are true and righteous, not liable to addition or
 detraction, with plain characters inscribed in the very material of the roll
 with the color of fire, as we read in Deuteronomy,---</p>
 
 <p>   "From his right hand they have a fire of
 law. Blessed art thou, O Israel. Blessed art thou, for what thy Jehovah has
 granted to thee, for the high station to which he has raised thee, for the
 abundance of favors which he has bestowed on thee above all others. Thou art
 the noble race; from thee the world becomes acquainted with virtue and
 knowledge; from thee the wise men receive their wisdom, and their laws are
 derived from thy laws; from its sea of abundance they have drunk; upon it they
 have relied and to its wisdom they have helped themselves, becoming thereby thy
 disciples."</p>
 
 <p>   Compare Deut. xxxiii. 3: "They shall bow
 before thy feet, and receive instruction from thy words"; for thy ennobling and
 thy honor that God spoke in Deut. iv. 6: "Since thy wisdom and prudence is
 before the eyes of the Gentiles who will hear all these commands, they will
 say, Verily this people is wise and prudent and far-seeing."  Continue to read to verse 8: "And what
 people is so great that it has commands and ordinances so just as those found
 in this law?" Again, verses 32, 33: "Ask now of the days that are past, which
 were before thee, since the day when God created man on earth, and from one end
 of the heaven to the other end of heaven, whether anything has ever been as
 this great thing, or whether there has ever been heard anything like it? Did
 any people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of fire as thou
 hast heard, and remain alive?"</p>
 
 <p>   Many similar examples could be multiplied
 which would make the exposition in this book somewhat lengthy. May God make you
 and us among those who cover us with the cover of righteousness, who put on the
 cover of righteousness and clothe themselves with the robe of purity. We have
 taken the privilege to explain fully in regard to this matter, that the
 obstinate may be made wise and abandon his way. He is ignorant who belies us by
 saying that the law did not come down from the righteous presence of God in one
 roll from beginning to end. He ignores the words of God and the meaning of his
 law. It may suffice us to say that even our opponents, such as <i>Haggoyim</i>,
 testify that no other book came as a whole from before the presence of God
 except the holy Torah. So much is enough to him who is not swayed by his lust,
 who follows truth and receives the divine guidance. </p>
 
 <p><i>The Most
 High God is most righteous, and possesses the best knowledge. I pray his
 forgiveness for all addition and subtraction.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>X.
 THE TWO STONE TABLETS.</p>
 
 <p>   I have been asked by some, concerning the two stone tablets
 which were broken, When were they prepared, and what happened to the writing
 after the breaking of the tablets? When were the second tablets placed in the
 chest? What was their size? What Scriptural grounds can be adduced to prove
 these answers?</p>
 
 <p>   The first two tablets were created by God in the beginning, and
 some claim that this was done on the third day of the creation, according to
 the high priest Micah. Others say that the two tablets were prepared when they
 were needed. We believe that the first statement is more valid. The writing was
 engraved upon them like the engraving of a signet ring, and was done by the
 hand of the Almighty. (Compare Ex. xxxi. 18, "written by the fingers of God.")
 It is said that the two tablets were the creation of God, and that their
 writings were the writings of the Divine Essence, engraved upon the two tablets
 which were handed to the apostle Moses by the chief of the angels, that is by
 Gabriel, the Archangel, at the close of Moses' forty days' fast. Some say that
 Moses found them before him at his feet at the place wherein he was tenting
 while on the mountain. This statement, I believe, (and I pray God to shield me
 from mistakes,) is more correct than that the Power Divine handed them to him
 without his seeing anything; for he was standing in darkness listening to the
 address of God coming from the midst of the fire. The writing was plain on
 either side, and all characters were horizontal in shape, without being
 connected the one with the other. Each tablet was a cubit and a half in length
 and in breadth, but three fourths of a cubit in height. They fitted the chest
 wonderfully. The thickness of both of them combined equaled two cubits and a
 half, in accordance with the height of the chest.</p>
 
 <p>   When Moses descended from the mountain and arrived at the
 outskirts of the encampment, he saw the calf and the frolic scene around it
 (and may such a scene never take place again), and his anger was boundless, and
 he dashed the two tablets to the earth in their presence and broke them. But,
 before doing so, he showed the people the two tablets, their bright likeness
 and wonderful engraving, declaring to then that God was angry at their deed,
 and hence they were unfit to receive the tablets. At that moment, God (may his
 name be exalted) caused the writing to disappear, and commanded Moses (upon
 whom be peace) to dash them on the ground. If God had not blotted out his
 writing from the two tablets, it would not have been lawful or possible unto
 Moses to break them. Thus the same disappeared up to heaven by the power of
 God, and nobody knew what became of them.</p>
 
 <p>   After his second fasting, while he was interceding for this
 great sin, his prayers having been answered, God commanded him to hew unto
 himself two tablets like unto the first, having the same shape and size. He,
 therefore, following the instruction of God, ascended the mountain and fasted
 forty days for the third time. And the two tablets were taken away from him and
 engraved by the hand of God, like the first two, with the ten commandments,
 only without addition or subtraction.</p>
 
 <p>   He came
 down with them on the ninth day of the seventh month, as we have stated
 already, and placed them in the chest which he had purposely prepared for them
 in his tent. And he placed them beside the holy Torah until the tabernacle was
 erected, when he deposited them in that, which Bezaleel had made, as we read in
 Exodus, "And he took and placed the testimonies in the chest." But the command
 was given first in Numbers, "And place the testimonies which I give thee in the
 chest." This was confirmed later on in Numbers: "And it was there as Jehovah
 commanded." </p>
 
 <p><i>And God possesses the best
 wisdom.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XI.
 THE TABLETS OF TESTIMONY.</p>
 
 <p>   Why were
 the two tablets called the tablets of testimony and the tablets of stone? They
 were called the tablets of testimony that they might be a living testimony,
 written in the correct and original Hebrew language, and containing all the
 Decalogue, against whomever may transgress them or change them or garble them.
 They were called so also, probably, because the children of Israel testified
 unto themselves to accept them and to act in accordance with all of what God
 spoke in Mount Sinai in their hearing and presence. Compare Exodus: "Whatever
 God commanded us we will obey and do." And that is probably why they were
 called tablets of stone to indicate that they were solid and of hard nature.
 The meaning, however, is deep, and God only fathoms its secrets.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XII.
 THE TRANSCIPTION OF THE TORAH.</p>
 
 <p>   When was the roll of the law read which was given to our lord
 Moses Ben Amram, when was it transcribed by his noble hand, and when did the
 children of Israel read the same and learn it, after the death of the apostle?</p>
 
 <p>   When the apostle received from God the holy roll, he placed it
 in his tent outside of the encampment, and God used to speak to him after the
 fog had encompassed the tent and covered the place where the holy roll was
 deposited. This was done there when consultation concerning the daily affairs
 of the people was needed. The commandments, however, were given to him in the
 tabernacle, between the two cherubim. The roll remained in its place for forty
 years. It was placed by the side of the chest which Bezaleel had prepared for
 the two tablets as soon as the tabernacle was erected, as we have stated
 before. During the first of the eleventh month of the fortieth year, Moses
 began to copy the holy law, and deposited two copies which he finished in the
 first month, one with the Levites, the other with the elders. Compare Duet.
 xxxi. 9: "And Moses wrote this law, and handed it to the priests, the sons of
 Levi, and to all the elders of Israel." And he taught them its content, as we
 find in the same chapter, verse 19. Some say that that verse refers to all the
 content of the law; for, at the end of these words, we read: "And after Moses
 finished writing down the commandments of this law in the roll," etc., he
 commanded the Levites to take the roll that came from God, and place it beside
 the chest of the two tablets. Compare Deut. xxxi. 26: "Take the roll of the
 Torah, and place it by the side of the chest of the covenant of your God, and
 let it be unto thee a witness."</p>
 
 <p>   The death of our lord Moses took place in the beginning of the
 twelfth month of the fortieth year, and the children of Israel mourned him
 during that whole month. And on the first day of the first month they left
 Arabat Moab, and on the tenth of the same they crossed the Jordan.</p>
 
 <p>   It is said they crossed the sea on Wednesday, and heard the
 voice of God on Wednesday, and crossed the Jordan on Wednesday. <i>And unto God
 belongs all wisdom and power.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XIII.   THE JORDAN.</p>
 
 <p>   If any one should ask, What is the Jordan? Answer, It is the
 river of the Torah.</p>
 
 <p>   They celebrated the Passover after they crossed the Jordan, and
 on the second day of the feast of Passover manna disappeared, and they ate from
 the products of the land and made therefrom unleavened bread. Then they began
 their seven years' war against the enemy, and on the seventh month of the
 seventh year they conquered their enemies entirely, and were rested, and
 erected the tabernacle on Mount Gerizim, which is the chosen place of the
 dwelling of the Most High God. They built the stone altar in accordance with
 the command of God, and offered due sacrifice, and fasted during the great day
 of sin covering, and celebrated the Feast of Tabernacles. On that day the high
 priest Eleazar Ben Aaron began to read the law to the people from the copy
 handed to them by Moses, the apostle of God, written by his noble hand, as we
 see in Deut. xv. 1, "At the end of seven years," in the first year of rest,
 when the children of Israel shall celebrate the feast and appear before the
 Lord they God in the place which he chose, shalt thou read before them this
 Torah in the hearing of the children of Israel. He began its reading on the
 feast day, and on the seventh day it was finished. It is said that he used to
 read to them some book each day.</p>
 
 <p>      He would stand on a high place, and would raise his voice so
 the whole people could hear his words and understand the meaning, and the
 import of the Torah,- what was to them pure and what was impure, the verses
 that were intended for men and those that were intended for women, all that God
 commanded that they should do and perform. Compare Num. xxxi. 12: "Gather ye
 the people, men and women, and the children and the neighbors and the
 strangers," that they may hear and be instructed. Some learned men say that, on
 account of the large number of people and the large space occupied by their
 tents, the high priest could not make himself understood to the farthest as
 well as the nearest to him, and therefore he used to adopt two plans: either to
 gather them in separate numbers and read to each; or to read to the chiefs of
 the people, the men of understanding, and have them instruct the rest. <i>And
 God knows best.</i></p>
 
 <p>   It is said that whenever seven years would pass, when the year
 of rest would take place, the high priest used to enter the tabernacle on the
 day of Sin Covering to burn incense. He would return, and with him he would
 have the roll of the Torah. And would read it to the people of Israel,
 according to one of the above plans during one of the seven days of the feast
 of Tabernacles. He would keep the roll throughout that whole year, for the
 people used to be scattered after their plowing and planting, tree-pruning, and
 the rest of their work. The scribes would present themselves before the high
 priest and examine the writing of the roll, the placement of characters, and
 the true spelling. During the second year, on the day of Sin Covering, he would
 return the roll to its place. Some learned men, however, say that the roll was
 never removed from its place in the tabernacle. It was only the roll that was
 written by the hand of Moses that was taken out and shown to the people, which
 is quite correct. <i>And God knows best the truth.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XIV.   THE SHINING OF MOSES' FACE.</p>
 
 <p>   I was asked by some, concerning the face of our lord Moses Ben
 Amram when it was bright and shone with light, When did it happen, and how did
 he use to deal with the people when he used to read them the words of God?</p>
 
 <p>   After the three forty days' fastings, light darted out from him
 with dazzling effulgence, outwardly and inwardly, and his noble face shone.
 This was one of the greatest wonders that he performed; for the one who keeps
 up fasting becomes feeble, he loses his strength, and the energy upon his face
 is lost. It was the contrary in his case; for, in spite of the long fasting, he
 shone with divine light, through the favor of God. This is implied in the
 saying of God in Ex. xxxiv. 10: "With thee I will do wonders again, which have
 never before been performed in all the earth, and before all men, and in all
 nations,"- meaning that none of the jewels of the earth will ever compare in
 brightness with this light with which he shone. He added "and in all nations,"
 meaning that there has never been any man among all the peoples of the earth
 who had ever come near possessing the same.</p>
 
 <p>   Verse 11 reads: "And all the people of which thou art will see
 that the work which the Lord thy God will so thee is wonderful," meaning that
 this wonder will be seen by the people without their being conscious of it. For
 we read in Ex. xxxiv. 39: "And Moses knew not that the skin of his face began
 to shine while he was speaking with him." And when he descended from the
 mountain, the children of Israel, with his brother Aaron, saw him while his
 face was brighter than the light of the sun. And they were dazzled with his
 look, and were afraid to approach him, as we read in verse 30, "they were
 afraid to approach him," although he knew nothing about the condition of his
 face, for he was like other men, and unable to see his own face. Calling them
 to draw near, he was informed of what they saw. Therefore he made for himself a
 face veil, in order that the people might behold him (may the peace of God be
 upon him). So then, whenever he addressed them, he would uncover his face, and
 would speak with them the words of God; and when he was through his address
 they would not be able to behold him. Whenever he went into the presence of God
 he unveiled himself, but when he addressed the people he put on the veil. <i>And
 God knows best.</i></p>
 
 <p>   I was asked by some, concerning Ex. xxiv. 10, "And they saw the
 God of Israel, and there was under his feet as it were a paved work of sapphire
 stone, as clear as the cloudless heaven," What did they see? They saw indeed
 our lord Gabriel the Archangel, the servant of the glorious God. To interpret
 the word <i>Elohim</i> as God would be gross ignorance, for God has neither member
 nor claw, because in the same verse we read: "under his feet." For God (who is
 exalted) is not seen, and cannot be likened to anything. Compare Ex. xxxiii.
 20: "For no man shall see me and live."</p>
 
 <p>   The word <i>Elohim</i> has different interpretations. It may be
 applied just as the words Rabbi and <i>Adonai</i> to several titled persons,
 such as the governor, sultan, etc., the number of which may render this
 treatise long. Therefore what they saw was not God, but Gabriel, as we have
 said. He was standing on a platform in the guise of a column as pure as a
 jewel, and very transparent, as we read in xxxiv. 10, "having the transparency
 of heaven in clearness. Our lord Gabriel was in the service of Hakkabod
 (Glory), whose look was like the very consuming fire. Compare Ex. xxiv. 17,
 "And the appearance of the glory of God was like the very consuming fire on the
 top of the mountain in the presence of the children of Israel."</p>
 
 <p>   At this time they were commanded what we read in Ex. xxiv. 1:
 "And he said to Moses, Come up thou and Aaron, and Nadab, and Abihu, and
 seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship from afar." It is said also, Let
 Moses and Aaron and Nadeb and Abihu and Ithamar come. And they saw the Lord of
 Israel while they were at the base of the mountain, but the people observed the
 light from the encampment, as we read in the same chapter, "in the presence of
 the children of Israel." This was on a different day from that of the day of
 the address before the Decalogue, for there we read in Ex. xix. 21: "Hurry down
 and warn this people, lest they be emboldened to see Jehovah." He also warned
 him to declare unto the people, even unto the priests, not to approach the
 mountain. He commanded them to consecrate themselves lest the chief angel
 should strike them. Compare verse 22: "And let the priests also, that come near
 unto Jehovah, sanctify themselves, lest the angel of Jehovah strike them down";
 and that is why we read in xxix. 11: "And upon the nobles of the children of
 Israel he laid not his hand," which means that they, with the exception of the
 apostles, did not embolden themselves, and did not approach without receiving a
 command, and did not commit any evil thing without being struck by the Lord.
 But they were favored with strength and power from on high, when they saw the
 chief archangel in that wonderful sea.</p>
 
 <p>   They returned safely and with gladness, eating and drinking.
 Compare Ex. xxiv. 11: "And they saw the angel of the Lord, and they ate and
 drank." Moses, however, did not receive the address which was all made in the
 presence of the people of Israel.</p>
 
 <p>   And I pray God for forgiveness for any addition or subtraction.
 This is what my tired mind and sickly understanding could discover. <i>And God
 possesses the best knowledge.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XV.            
 THE WATER AT REPHIDIM.</p>
 
 <p>   To the question, What happened in Rephidim of miracles, on
 account of the lack of water, and its appearance through Moses? My answer here
 follows.</p>
 
 <p>   Before the war with the Amalekites they encamped in Rephidim and
 were very thirsty, as, when they encamped there, they found no water. They
 quarreled with the apostle Moses (upon whom be peace), and told him: "Arise,
 and give us water, that we may drink, together with our children and babes and
 cattle." But the apostle told them: "Why quarrel ye with me, and tempt Jehovah?"
 They let him alone; but, on account of their parching thirst, they returned
 unto him, and said: "Did you intend to bring us out of Egypt that we might
 perish of thirst? If we ourselves were guilty, and did not deserve to be given
 water, the children and the cattle, in what have they sinned, that they should
 die of thirst?" The apostle, knowing that they were to strike him down, cried
 to God for help, and the answer was immediate: "Pass before the people, and be
 not afraid, and take with thee some of the elders of Israel."</p>
 
 <p>   This was done that they might behold the wonder, and not in
 company with the people; for the place from which he caused the water to gush
 forth was far away, and all the people could not behold it. And Jehovah knew
 that there was no good in their coming to it to behold it. The place was Horeb.
 In verse 6 it reads, "Behold, I," meaning that the angel will stand in a pillar
 of cloud in the place which he was to strike.</p>
 
 <p>   Arriving, the apostle, in company with the elders, smote the rock
 with his well-known staff; and behold the water in abundance flowing out of it,
 which formed a large river. This river is the one alluded to in Deut. ix. 21,
 "I have cast its dust in the river which flowed from the mountain." It divided
 into two branches, one branch toward Rephidim and the other toward the
 wilderness of Sinai, of which they drank during their stay in the wilderness.
 That place was called Meribah in Ex. xvii. 7: "And he called the name of the
 place Massah Meribah." The first word, Masseh, refers to their tempting God, as
 we read in xxii. 2; and this was due to their great ignorance, lack of faith
 and trust in the presence of God, and in his power to overcome their hunger and
 their thirst. Verse 7 proves this; for in it we are told that they said: "Is
 God among us, or not?" This was prohibited by God, as we read in Deut. vi. 16:
 "Ye shall not tempt Jehovah your God, as ye tempted him in Massah." The word
 "Meribah" refers to the quarrel which they had with the apostle. <i>But God
 knows best.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XVI.   THE BATTLE WITH THE AMALEKITES.</p>
 
 <p>   As to the question of the Amalekites' battle and the reason why
 the Amalekites came from a far country to fight them in that place, we may
 answer, that this took place for several reasons: First, that God might remind
 them of what they had committed in past sins, when they desired water and
 tempted him, quarreling with his apostle, that they might reform and repent.
 Second, when the king of the Amalekites heard of the arrival of the children of
 Israel, and feared lest they would attack his land on account of his courage
 and his strength of character and his God-offending pride, he sought to fight
 them in the wilderness easier than it would be possible for him had they been
 in a nearly settled country, thereby showing to the rest of the nations his
 audacity and boldness. Therefore God sentenced him to perdition, as we read in
 Num. xxi. 20: "The first of the nations is Amalek, but its end is perdition."</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XVII.
 THE REASON FOR NOT DESTROYING THE AMALEKITES EARLIER.</p>
 
 <p>   Should one ask, Why did not God destroy, as he was able, the
 Amalekites before they fought the children of Israel? We answer, God was surely
 able to do so, but he allowed this to help him, that it might be an example and
 reminder, like the affair of Pharaoh, together with the miracles that took
 place to his advantage and to that of his people: that the children of Israel
 might know the great favor of God in destroying this Amalek, who was a giant,
 and greater than he God had never before created; and that they might know the
 art of war and tactics and courage, so that, when Sihon and Og and the rest
 should come against them, they would fight without fear.</p>
 
 <p>   Again, the coming of this great giant with his Amalekites was
 for the purpose of destroying all those who complained and quarreled with out
 lord Moses in connection with the water. Compare xvii. 11. As to the real
 battle, Moses gave its conduct to Joshua Ben Nun because he was sure of his
 courage, and that the apostle Moses might stay on the mountain interceding and
 praying for success. Of this our lord Moses had informed his disciple Joshua,
 saying to him, that what he would do would take place on the marrow. At that
 time, therefore, he ascended the mountain in company with Aaron and Hur, who
 was the grandfather of Bezaleel, who built the tabernacle.</p>
 
 <p>   One stood on his right and the other on his left, while the
 apostle stood interceding and praying, with his hands raised towards heaven
 towards the holy place, and his staff in his hand. Verse 12 tells us that his
 hands became tired; and therefore Aaron and Hur supported them, for he was
 higher than they, as they placed under him a stone, and he sat on it: "But
 Moses' hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put under him, and he sat
 thereon."</p>
 
 <p>   Now if some ask, Why did the apostle not keep his hands raised,
 since he knew that in raising them Israel had victory, and in lowering them
 Amalek had it? Why did he not keep his hands raised until all the Amalekites
 had perished? The answer is, that this was done in accordance with the command
 of God when he ordered that others should lower them, that beholders may know
 the high station he had before God. They, no less than the whole nation, had
 need to know. This took place, according to what we have kept in our memory, on
 Friday.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><i>The
 Standing of the Sun.</i></p>
 
 <p>   The battle did not cease at the end of the day. Therefore the
 sun stopped for a sufficient time to allow Joshua a complete victory over the
 Amalekites before sunset. Amalek and the people who followed him must be killed
 before the coming in of the Sabbath, for at the sunset the Sabbath would begin,
 and Israel would be bound in with its conditions, and could not continue to
 fight. This we have taken from the book attributed to him and know as the book
 of Joshua. <i>And God knows all these things best.</i></p>
 
 <p>   However, we could infer this from Ex. xvii. 12, for we read:
 "And his hands were kept steady until the going down of the sun." This was due,
 probably, to what we know of the same verse and the preceding one. When Amalek
 and his people were destroyed, God commanded Moses to write down the record of
 this battle in a roll, and to read it in the hearing of Joshua, that he and the
 people might know that God blotted out the name and the mention of the
 Amalekites from under the entire heaven, that the people might recover their
 courage, as they had been terribly afraid, since the giant had come from a very
 far place to fight them boldly. Then the apostle built in that place an altar,
 and sacrificed thank offerings to God for his health, and called the place
 "Jehovah is my standard," meaning "O Jehovah, thou art my high mark. To thee I
 direct myself in the time of need, as men direct themselves to the standard of
 the king wherein his camp is in the time of need." Some learned men claim that
 the name was not called <i>Nessij</i>, but <i>Ness</i>, without the <i>ij</i>,
 meaning that this altar was to be a standard of a sign to Israel whereby the
 nations should know what God had done for them in delivering them from Amalek.
 Therefore it was called <i>Hanness</i>, meaning the standard of the sign. Some
 say it is derived from <i>Hannoseh</i>, which is the name given to the angel
 who is occupied with the affairs of Israel, and this is the interpretation of
 our most devout and chiefest of poets, our lord Phinehas, in the words to be
 spoken on the great day of great fasting, and those of his son our lord
 Abishah. Among the secret properties of this name one is it contains the exact
 numerical value of the period our lord Moses lived- 120 years.   NeSeh=120.</p>
 
 <p>    The apostle closed his words with the saying, "The hand is upon
 the throne of Jehovah. (He has sworn) there will be a war for Jehovah with
 Amalek from generation to generation." Some explain the last two words forever
 and ever. This was done so that Joshua might not be carried off with his
 strength and courage because he destroyed Amalek, but that he might remember
 his ability was from God, that he might be humble and attribute nothing to
 himself. From the word <i>Kessah</i> we have now what we call "the verse of the
 throne," for the word means "throne." <i>And God possesses the best knowledge.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Any one that desires to learn further, let him read what our
 learned men have written upon the Sabbath of Amalek. This is all that my sickly
 intelligence and weak mind has discovered, and <i>we will some day return to
 God.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XVIII.   THE TIME OF JETHRO'S VISIT.</p>
 
 <p>   A question concerning the story of Jethro: When did he come to
 his son-in-law? Was it while he was in Rephidim or after? According to the
 Torah, he arrived at Rephidim before Israel went to Mount Sinai; but we cannot
 be led with the order, for the words of the Torah may imply the time either
 before or after. We believe, however, that it is more correct to hold that his
 visit was on Mount Sinai. Compare Ex. xviii. 5: "And Jethro, the father-in-law
 of Moses, came with his sons and his wife to the wilderness where he was
 encamped, at the mount of God." These words are clear enough, and need no more
 explanation. According to the commentaries written by that most excellent
 doctor of blessed memory, Sadakah, his visit to Mount Sinai was in the second
 year after the erection of the tabernacle. We can prove that from the words
 given in the fifth book i.6: "Jehovah our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, ye
 have dwelt long enough in this mountain. Turn and take your journey," etc. Then
 in the next passage, beginning with verse 9: "And I spake unto you at that
 time, saying, I am not able to bear you alone myself," etc.</p>
 
 <p>   Read the following verses, where he informs us that he
 established "chiefs of thousands and of hundreds," referring to what Jethro his
 father-in-law had advised him. Thus we know that it was before their departure
 from Mount Sinai this new arrangement was done. It was due to Jethro, who gave
 the advice the very morning of the day when he arrived at where the apostle
 was, as we read in Ex. xviii. 13. This passage is the greatest proof to us that
 Jethro arrived in the beginning of the second year of the departure of the
 Israelites from Egypt, after the erection of the tabernacle. Therefore no
 attention should be paid to the suggestion that his visit took place before
 their entrance into the wilderness of Sinai, for we read in Ex. xviii. 27: "And
 Moses sent his father-in-law, who went to his home." Again, we know the
 departure of Jethro to his land took place during the time when they were about
 to leave Mount Sinai, as we read in Num. x. 29: "And Moses said to Jethro, the
 son of Hobab the Midianite, his father-in-law, We are about to leave." And he
 asked him to go with them; but he refused, saying, "No, I cannot go, but I
 shall go to my land and to my kindred." And this is an additional and plain
 testimony to our position.</p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p><i>Why
 Both Hobab and Jethro?</i></p>
 
 <p>   If one asks, Why was he called here Hobab when his name was
 Jethro? We will say, The name <i>Hobab</i> means "loving," and was given to him
 by the apostle Moses. Compare deut. xxxiii. 3, <i>af hobeb ammim</i>, "he
 loveth (is lover of) the people." He loved piety, and offered sacrifices of
 thanks to God for his great favors to Israel, for delivering them from Egypt.
 Read Ex. xviii. 10-12: "Blessed be Jehovah, who delivered you from the hand of
 the Egyptians, and from that of Pharaoh,...and Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took
 a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God." To those who assert that Jethro took
 place while he was high priest of Midian, but his people continued in their
 heathenish way, and he left them, believing in God and in his oneness. That is
 why the people lost their respect for him, and his daughters were driven away,
 and not allowed by the shepherds to water their sheep; for it was but right
 that his sheep should have been given the right of way first and allowed to
 drink, for Jethro was the high priest. Were it not for his conversion, Moses
 would not have entered into his family by marrying one of his daughters.</p>
 
 <p>   The words of Jethro, <i>Attah yadaty</i>, "Now I know," imply
 only a declaration, but nothing reflecting on his former belief. Having heard
 of the deeds of God's power and greatness, he renewed his belief in him and his
 greatness by saying, "God is greater than all the gods."</p>
 
 <p>   If one should say, Why was not the account of the visit
 postponed, and recorded at its own place? We would reply in two ways: First, as
 it was God's plan to record ordinances and occurrences, some anticipating others,
 and as the account of Jethro's visit was short, he recorded it here. Second,
 God may have recorded Jethro's visit in chapter xviii., in order that it  might be read immediately after the account
 of the battle with Amalek, that Jethro's superiority and nobility of character
 might be the more noticed. He was related to Amalek, being the son of Reuel and
 a descendant of Esau; and Amalek, we know, was the son of Eliphaz, a descendent
 of Esau. The latter came to do evil to Israel, but the former came to do good; and
 that is what prompted Moses to call him <i>Hobab,</i> or "lover," and to be
 pleased with his counsel, which he obeyed. He therefore asked what may be read
 in Num. x. 31-32. A like example and precedent may be found in Genesis, where
 the account of Judah is given in the story of Joseph, and where it is said that
 when Judah saw the harlot woman, he went to her, but as to Joseph, when the
 harlot saw him she sought him, but he ran away from her, and the difference and
 superiority of the one over the other may be well marked out. <i>Enough. The
 best knowledge is that of God.</i></p>
 
 <p>   The most learned and wise doctor, Jacob Ben Isaak, the physician
 of Askelon, says, in his book called "The Commentaries of Ordinances," that
 Jethro made two visits to his son-in-law; first, in company with Moses' wife
 and two children; and last with the intention of settling down with him and
 entering into his religion and fulfilling the ordinances, together with all
 those who moved with him of his children and neighbors, thereby becoming like the
 Israelites, with the same rights and privileges. It is said that the children
 of Jethro received a portion of the promised land in preference to the rest of
 the Gentiles, who were converted to our religion.  <i>God alone, however, is infallible.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XIX.   THE SONS OF MOSES.</p>
 
 <p>   To the question, whether the children of
 Moses, with their mother, returned with Jethro or remained with Moses, I
 answer, The wife of Moses, or the mother of the children, remained with the
 apostle without ever being known by him, as we know from Num. xii. 1: "And
 Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses on account of the beautiful woman whom he
 had taken." This <i>Ishah</i>, or "woman," was exactly the same Zeborah, and
 not, as the Jews pretend, that the apostle Moses took a Cushite woman as a wife,
 -<i>Kusheet, </i>that is " a black woman." <i>May God fight them for this
 imputation on the Apostle!</i> The fact is that the apostle Moses did never
 remarry, not to say that he had married a black woman, a marriage that was
 quite prohibited, and the Israelites were absolutely forbidden to approach such
 women. The qualifying word is <i>Kasheet</i>, which means "beautiful," and not
 Kusheet, as the Jews had it, meaning "black," thereby reversing the meaning of
 the passage[1].</p>
 
 <p>   For the apostle, after conversing with God
 in the burning bush, did never know a woman; and we will prove this in another
 place, if the Lord wills. As to the children, according to our lord high priest
 Jacob, in his book entitled "Pleasure Hours," they returned with Jethro; but
 the apostle, fearing they might go astray after his death, in accordance with
 what he said in Deut. xxxi.39, wrote them a copy of the Torah, and handed it to
 them, and sent them in company with their grandfather Jethro. They, however,
 did not return to their former place, but in company with a party of people,
 who were to see to the fulfillment of the Torah and its commands, went towards
 the east, and their descendants are still living; but they had a nomadic life,
 like the Arabs, dwelling in their hair tents. The writer of the aforesaid book
 says that their descendants will live unto the end, in their obedience to God.
 When Moses bade his children good-by, the writer says, he uttered the following
 words: "Peace be to you, O Gershom and Eliezer!" This was a covenant of peace,
 a guarantee from all dangers, and it would not be possible that their race be
 cut off to the end of the world. Only Jehovah had concelled them and set them
 afar, that none may know their whereabouts until he permits it. <i>And God
 knows best!</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XX.   THE HEIR OF AN
 ADULTRESS.</p>
 
 <p>   Question: Should a man take to himself a
 woman as his wife he discovers afterwards to have violated her purity, and who
 is adjudged to be killed; if she is killed, who will be her heir?</p>
 
 <p>   Her heir will be the high priest who
 adjudges her to death. None else, whether he be a relative or neighbor, or even
 her husband, can inherit the least thing from her. This can be inferred from
 Num. v. 5-8: "When a man or a woman commit any sin...if the person have no
 kinsman to whom restitution may be made for the guilt, such restitution that is
 made unto Jehovah for guilt must be the priest's." The writer of this answer
 compares it with the case of the inheritance of the daughters of Zelophehad,
 who would not have inherited their father, unless it were for the fact that he
 did rebel against God, for they said: "He was not among them that gathered
 themselves against Jehovah in the company of Korah: but he died in his own sin"
 (Num. xxvii.3). His sin resulted from his work on the Sabbath: on that day he
 was discovered felling wood, which was not rebellion, and therefore his
 daughters deserved to inherit him. The unbeliever or rebellious, according to
 our learned men, can neither inherit nor be inherited. It is said that in such
 a case as we have already mentioned, the money advanced, or whatever was
 promised to the woman by the husband before the marriage to be paid by him
 after the marriage, even if it were advanced to her previous to the discovery
 of her guilt, the same forms a part of her inheritance, and he can lay no claim
 to it. <i>And God knows the unknown.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XXI. THE FACE OF LABAN.</p>
 
 <p>   Why is it that in Gen. xxxi.2, "And Jacob
 saw the face of Laban, and, behold, they were not <i>Eynam</i> as before," the
 plural form is used? The reading <i>Eynam</i> refers surely as well to the children
 of Laban.[2]
 For the first verse reads, "And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying,
 Jacob hath taken away all that was our father's." Thus <i>Eynam</i> refers to
 them as well as to their father. Our lord Jacob discovered the inner change of
 Laban from that of his face; for nothing he concealed within himself but leaked
 through the features of his face and the utterances of his tongue. The
 countenance of man is the mirror of his soul. Some say that the sharp sight of
 the believer unveils the inner soul. <i>But God knows best.</i></p>
 
 <p><i> </i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XXII.  CONCERNING
 OATHS.</p>
 
 <p>   How can you harmonize the command of the
 Decalogue, "Do not pronounce the name of Jehovah thy God in vain," and the one,
 "Do not swear falsely in my name," with "His words he shall not unbind or
 break"? Answer: The command given in Deut. v. 11, meaning, "Thou shalt not
 raise," etc., really does not mean to prohibit something the carrying of which
 is sinful, nor the raising or lifting of an object from one place to another;
 but the command means simply, "Do not pronounce" the name of the Most High in
 false utterances, just as we have the same words <i>Lo tish-sha</i> in the
 prohibitive command <i>Lo tish-sha shoma shaw</i>, meaning, "Do not pronounce
 or raise a false report"- avoid spreading reports of the veracity of which you
 are not sure. Our learned men have divided oaths under three heads.</p>
 
 <p>   First. The prohibited oath of falsehood, as
 meaning "Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor," and "Thou
 shalt not bear vain or untruthful witness."</p>
 
 <p>   Second. The prohibited oath for selling or
 buying commodities either without weight or measure, but by mere guesswork.</p>
 
 <p>   Third. The prohibited oaths which are made
 for no purpose whatever, and nothing is affirmed or denied thereby. From the
 command "Thou shalt not swear falsely in my name," we may infer that an oath
 may be either obligatory, or lawful, or vicious. The first is the right of the
 one accused of crime but without evidence. The oath is to be made in the court
 before the judge, for Jehovah said, "In my name thou shalt swear"; also, "The
 oath of Jehovah shall be between them." The lawful oath is that which binds a
 man to performance if the act be lawful; as, refraining from eating, drinking,
 fasting, and wearing costly apparels, etc. The oath is such cases is binding,
 and must be carried out. The vicious oath is that which is made falsely,
 coupling the name of the Most High God with things unlikely or false, and
 thereby dishonoring him. Compare "Ye shall not swear falsely in my name, and
 thus profane the name of God. I am Jehovah."</p>
 
 <p>   The punishment of such a transgression must
 be meted out with death. The transgressor profanes the name God by such an
 oath, made in any other tongue. As to Lev. v. 2, it means that the swearer
 rashly must be bound to his oath, if sin is not to be committed; but if his
 oath is due to causes which render him unconscious of his oath, such as
 drinking, he is not responsible; if conscious, he is quite responsible and must
 carry out his obligation. Then God said, "He shall not break his word; he shall
 do according to all that which proceeded out of his mouth."</p>
 
 <p>   Our learned men have written with great
 zeal concerning the import of "Thou shalt not pronounce the name of Jehovah
 they God falsely." Of the many allusions this passage contains, one is to the
 hypocrite, who shows piety to the world, but who is secretly attached to his
 sins and to a life of immorality, a slave to his passions, and therefore his
 connection with God is groundless, and the pronunciation of God's name is in
 vain, and untrue to his conviction. Therefore God said: "For Jehovah will not
 hold him guiltless, who pronounces his name falsely." Clear! The man whose
 conduct is so characterized is more afraid of the creature than of the Creator,
 and cannot be guiltless before God, for his false oath. Every word God as given
 in the revealed Torah through our lord Moses (upon whom be peace) possesses
 several allusions which are to be applied in their proper places. This is
 enough for the man who lays aside his prejudice, and is willing to receive
 guidance and act piously. In all such things let God be the final judge, and
 let the sentence he utters be carried out. This is all which a tired mind and
 sickly intelligence could discover. <i>But the Most High knows best what is
 ideally right.</i></p>
 
 <p><i> </i></p>
 
 <p>XXIII.   THE
 INHERITANCE OF A WOMAN WHO MARRIES OUTSIDE THE TRIBE.</p>
 
 <p>   If a man should die leaving behind him
 wealth, such as land, etc., but no male heir who may legally inherit him; if he
 should be survived by daughters, married in families other than his and outside
 of the tribe, what should be done with the wealth of the defunct? Have the
 daughters any rightful claim on them or not? What would follow? The answer
 (praise be to God only) is as follows. The daughters who are the only offspring
 of their parents should marry their cousins of their tribe, if they desire
 valid claim to their shares, in order that the inheritance may continue to be
 theirs. Remember that the daughters of Zelophehad, when their request was
 granted, were conditioned to marry in the tribe of their father; for the
 inheritance  should never pass from one
 tribe to another. Our predecessors (may God be pleased with them) said, and
 their saying must be obeyed, that even if the daughter who has inherited from
 her father should desire to marry a man outside of her tribe she would be
 disinherited, and others worthier than she, who belong to the tribe, would
 receive the inheritance. This statement is absolute, and liable to no
 modification. The land of the defunct should not be transferred to his
 daughters who are his only heirs, but who have married into another tribe. The
 inheritance of their father must remain intact; another tribe in not to enjoy
 its use. It must be preserved and carefully guarded until God's purpose is made
 manifest relative to the daughters of the defunct. Should their husbands die,
 they are entitled to the inheritance; should they die, the inheritance becomes
 the property of the House of God, if there is none that may have a legal claim
 to it. Cf. Num. v. 8, "And if there is no kinsman to the man that restitution
 may be made to him for the guilt, the restitution that is made for the guilt
 unto Jehovah shall belong to the priest." The restitution to the priest is made
 as if to the House of God. This is according to our understanding of the law
 and to the exact interpretation of our learned men.  <i>But the Most High God knows best the exact truth. Verily he
 knows the unknown.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <p>XXIV.   THE USE OF
 RENNET.</p>
 
 <p>   Some of my people asked me concerning the
 use made by our predecessors of the rennet of the suckling kid, in order to
 make cheese, by placing it in milk, and the continuance of this custom until
 the attention of the humble writer was called to it, resulting in its
 abolition; and since then we have not discovered any using it. As to the use of
 the rennet by our people, I may say it is surely a great vice which our people
 introduced inadvertently. They had either taken it from the Jews, or had been
 deceived into adopting it by some indifferent believers in the days of <i>Benutan</i>.
 Nobody seemed to have spoken against the practice, as it is evident many
 generations had come and passed without the least attention having been called
 to it.</p>
 
 <p>   If one should ask, How could this have
 taken place during all this time and period, the length of which is unknown,
 and none of the former learned and able men had ever attempted to oppose and
 prohibit the practice? For an answer, I can only say that God, in his divine
 foreknowledge, knew that doubtless some faults would be unknowingly committed
 by his hosts, and their eyes could not discover them, and therefore, he said in
 Lev. iv. 13: "And if the whole congregation of Israel shall err, and a certain
 thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly." Otherwise no need of this passage
 would have been found. No guilt is therefore to be laid on us, or on those who
 preceded us, for this practice; for it was due to a general inadvertence.
 Behold how careful we are in our use of meat in connection with milk or milk in
 connection with meat. Should a vessel have the least trace of flesh or milk;
 should it not even be very clean, and then any of the two substances, flesh or
 milk, be placed in it, it becomes, according to us, <i>Tamay</i>, that is,
 "defiled." Even if the salt that touched the meat be used with milk, the same
 state of pollution would follow, and we could not use the milk.</p>
 
 <p>   The rennet is, in reality, one of the
 portions of the sheep or kid that belongs to the priest, and should be
 immediately delivered to him, and no delay made: for it is <i>Kadosh</i>,
 "holy." Since it contains milk, and the butcher removes it and cuts it while
 both knife and hands are stained with flesh and blood, it becomes binding to us
 to have nothing to do with its use as food, if we are to be faithful to our
 tradition and practices. I, therefore, in order to keep my religious duties,
 have put its use under the ban. Its eating is neither necessary nor binding,
 and we have neither command nor law to that effect; but we use it as we use
 butter and fat and the like. It is unlike the unleavened bread and the
 sacrifices of the Passover which must be eaten. We must not defile our souls by
 a doubtful thing which we can easily do. God said, "Do not defile your souls,"
 and "Ye shall be holy to God," etc. This is sufficient. </p>
 
 <p><i>To obey is
 safest, and God knows best.</i></p>
 
 <p> </p>
 
 <h6 align="CENTER">XXV.        
 THE ABRIDGMENT BY LAYMEN OF THE AUTHORITY</h6>
 
 <p>OF THE PRIESTHOOD.</p>
 
 <p>   A few men of the laity protested that they
 should be "associates" of the Scribes in giving judgments and supervising the
 estates of the priesthood. Can there be any attention paid to them, and have
 they any right to their claim? If what they claim is vain, please give them a
 confuting reply, and convict them strongly of their vicious pretensions; and
 may the kind giver reward you!</p>
 
 <p>   The answer: The noble Torah gives the
 children of Levi complete authority over all the estates or offerings of the
 temple. None else can have any hand in these matters. Thus said God in Num.
 xviii. 1: "And Jehovah said to Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy fathers' house
 with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary. And thou and thy sons with
 thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. And thy brethren also, the
 line of Levi, the tribe of thy father, draw them near with thee, that they will
 be responsible as he was." God foreknew that the descendants of Aaron are the
 children of Levi. Again, we are plainly told that in whatever matter not
 indicated by the law, the decision of the priests, the sons of Levi, should
 prevail, and could not be modified unless by some legal reasons. Read Deut. xviii.
 8: "If there be concealed from thee a matter in judging, as between blood and
 blood, between plea and plea, or stroke and stroke, matters of
 controversy...arise, and go up to the place, which Jehovah thy God has chosen, to
 the Levite priests." Their decision is binding, as we read in verse 10:
 "according to the decision they shall tell thee thou shalt do; thou shalt not
 turn aside from the sentence they shall show thee, neither to the right nor to
 the left." The same is affirmed in those things set apart fro God: "Then the
 priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad; as the priest shall value it,
 so it shall stand" (Lev. xxvii. 14).</p>
 
 <p>   In addition, I must say that, from
 Scriptural inferences, the high priest of the people must have his due honor.
 None should injure his name or measure up himself beyond him, as one may do
 with others. His people should pay him their respects and esteem, and should
 not look at him as any of their ordinary fellow citizens. Distinction and
 preference should be given all his people, for it is apparent to all
 intelligent people that not every man of any grade could be made into a high
 priest, lest his practices humiliate him and keep him aloof, lest God be
 displeased and his worship be vain; this especially given with reference to the
 Levites, who are, as the righteous Lord has said, the chosen persons for
 priesthood, prayer, blessing, and divine judgments. Compare Deut. xviii. 5:
 "For Jehovah thy God has chosen him out of all thy tribes, that he may stand to
 serve in the name of Jehovah, he and his sons all the days." This means that
 they were chosen from ancient days to be honored and respected.</p>
 
 <p>   I have found, also, that the Levite must
 not be discarded and others followed: "Beware of the discarding the Levite the
 length of thy days on earth" (Deut. xii. 19). It is in connection with the
 tribe of Levi that the apostle Moses made the prayer found in Deut. xxxiii. 11,
 that its prayers may be heard, and blessings may be bestowed; that its enemies
 may be crushed, as "O Jehovah, bless his strength, and be pleased with the
 words of his hands." A warning is given that the Levite may not be opposed, as
 we read in the same verse: "But break through the lions of those that rebel
 against him and hate him." The learned Hasam Assoory of Tyrus explains these
 words as follows: He who harbors any evil thing or hatred against this tribe,
 Jehovah will smite him with great calamities, and his plans will fail; for the
 prayers or curses of the Levites shoot through faster than very arrows. As to the
 words "Break through the lions of the opposers and haters," they mean that he
 who would plan to do such things is only a darer, who is unaware of his
 conditions, and is like the man who drinks poison to try it. To impress the
 people with dire consequences of such an attempt, he says, "Who could oppose
 him?" Therefore, I believe that it is not lawful to depart at any time from
 their given decisions and pleasures, nor is it lawful to call a halt to them
 through reasons of expediency, on merely mental grounds- for they have been
 long before empowered by the declarations of the Torah, and it is not to be
 imagined that the decisions of others are applicable to them unless there is
 against them a legal plea. <i>And God knows best.</i></p>
 
 <p>   Now I ask you readers of this my epistle to
 explain to me the exact meaning of the words of Jehovah in Deut. xix. 14, "Thou
 shalt not remove the landmarks of thy neighbors which the ancients have set
 up." What meaning do you put on the word <i>Reeshoneem</i>, "first ones,"
 "ancient ones"? God has affirmed this command with strong terms, for he said,
 "Cursed be the man who changes the landmarks of his neighbor."</p>
 
 <p>   Pray, inform me, also, concerning the
 meaning of the words, "Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. I am God." How
 contrary to this command do we act! How we do hate each other, and how we do
 backbite each other! To these things is due our downfall and utter relapse. So
 much is sufficient.</p>
 
 <p>   And, as
 for the rest, though it is unknown to me, and I understand not even the
 boundaries of that I know not, it is definite in the mind of God, and he knows
 all. Amen.</p>
