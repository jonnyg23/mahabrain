 <p>PHILOSOPHY I have read, and thoroughly understood,<br> The utmost depth of my teachers’ knowledge have I sounded.<br> This God graciously granted to me,<br> Giving me a heart to understand wisdom.<br> Thus I became the Author of this Book,<br> And I have clearly set forth the whole matter,<br> That Rich and Poor might understand.<br> There is nothing like it upon earth;<br> Nor (God be praised) have I therein forgotten my humble self.<br> I am acquainted with the only true foundation:<br> Therefore preserve this Book with care,<br> And take heed that you study it again and again.<br> Thus shall you receive and learn the truth,<br> And use this great gift of God for good ends.<br> O God the Father, which art of all the beginning and end,<br> We beseech thee for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ<br> To enlighten our minds and thoughts,<br> That we may praise Thee without ceasing,<br> And accomplish this Book according to Thy will!<br> Direct Thou everything to a good end,<br> And preserve us through Thy great mercy.—<br> With the help of God I will shew you this Art,<br> And will not hide or veil the truth from you.<br> After that you understand me aright,<br> You will soon be free from the bonds of error.<br> For there is only <i>one</i> substance,<br> In which all the rest is hidden;<br> Therefore, keep a good heart.<br> Coction, time, and patience are what you need;<br> If you would enjoy the precious reward,<br> You must cheerfully give both time and labour.<br> For you must subject to gentle coction the seeds and the metals,</p>
