 				EPISTLE TO HENRY II  
 <p>
 TO THE MOST INVINCIBLE 
 MOST POWERFUL AND MOST CHRISTIAN 
 HENRY, KING OF FRANCE THE SECOND: 
 MICHEL NOSTRADAMUS, 
 HIS VERY HUMBLE AND VERY OBEDIENT SERVANT AND SUBJECT, 
 WISHES VICTORY AND HAPPINESS 
 </p><p>
 Ever since my long-beclouded face first presented itself before the  
 immeasurable deity of your Majesty, O Most Christian and Most Victorious King, 
 I have remained perpetually dazzled by that sovereign sight. I have never 
 ceased to honor and venerate properly that date when I presented myself  
 before a Majesty so singular and so humane. I have searched for some occasion 
 on which to manifest high heart and stout courage, and thereby obtain even  
 greater recognition of Your Most Serene Majesty. But I saw how obviously  
 impossible it was for me to declare myself. 
 </p><p>
 While I was seized with this singular desire to be transported suddenly from  
 my long-beclouded obscurity to the illuminating presence of the first monarch  
 of the universe, I was also long in doubt as to whom I would dedicate these  
 last three Centuries of my prophecies, making up the thousand. After having  
 meditated for a long time on an act of such rash audacity, I have ventured to  
 address Your Majesty. I have not been daunted like those mentioned by that  
 most grave author Plutarch, in his Life of Lycurgus, who were so astounded at  
 the expense of the offerings and gifts brought as sacrifices to the temples  
 of the immortal gods of that age, that they did not dare to present anything  
 at all. Seeing your royal splendor to be accompanied by such an incomparable  
 humanity, I have paid my address to it and not as those Kings of Persia whom  
 one could neither stand before nor approach. 
 </p><p>
 It is to a most prudent and most wise Prince that I have dedicated my  
 nocturnal and prophetic calculations, which are composed rather out of a  
 natural instinct, accompanied by a poetic furor, than according to the strict  
 rules of poetry. Most of them have been integrated with astronomical  
 calculations corresponding to the years, months and weeks of the regions,  
 countries and most of the towns and cities of all Europe, including Africa  
 and part of Asia, where most of all these coming events are to transpire.  
 They are composed in a natural manner. 
 </p><p>
 Indeed, someone, who would do well to blow his nose, may reply that the  
 rhythm is as easy as the sense is difficult. That, O Most Humane king, is  
 because most of the prophetic quatrains are so ticklish that there is no  
 making way through them, nor is there any interpreting of them. 
 </p><p>
 Nevertheless, I wanted to leave a record in writing of the years, towns,  
 cities and regions in which most of the events will come to pass, even those  
 of the year 1585 and of the year 1606, reckoning from the present time, which  
 is March 14, 1557, and going far beyond to the events which will take place  
 at the beginning of the seventh millenary, when, so far as my profound  
 astronomical calculations and other knowledge have been able to make out,  
 the adversaries of Jesus Christ and his Church will begin to multiply greatly. 
 </p><p>
 I have calculated and composed all during choice hours of well-disposed days,  
 and as accurately as I could, all when Minerva was free and not unfavorable.  
 I have made computations for events over almost as long a period to come as  
 that which has already passed, and by these they will know in all regions  
 what is to happen in the course of time, just as it is written, with  
 nothing superfluous added, although some may say, There can be no truth  
 entirely determined concerning the future.  
 </p><p>
 It is quite true, Sire, that my natural instinct has been inherited from my  
 forebears, who did not believe in predicting, and that this is natural  
 instinct has been adjusted and integrated with long calculations. At the same  
 time, I freed my soul, mind and heart of all care, solicitude and vexation.  
 All of these prerequisites for presaging I achieved in part by means of the  
 brazen tripod.  
 </p><p>
 There are some who would attribute to me that which is not mine at all. The  
 eternal God alone, who is the thorough searcher of humane hearts, pious, just  
 and merciful, is the true judge, and it is to him I pray to defend me from  
 the calumny of evil men. These evil ones, in their slanderous way, would  
 likewise want to inquire how all your most ancient progenitors, the Kings of  
 France, have cured the scrofula, how those of other nations have cured the  
 bite of snakes, how those of yet other nations have had a certain instinct  
 for the art of divination and still others which would be too long to recite  
 here. 
 </p><p>
 Notwithstanding those who cannot contain the malignity of the evil spirit, as  
 time elapses after my death, my writings will have more weight than during my  
 lifetime. Should I, however, have made any errors in my calculation of dates,  
 or prove unable to please everybody, I beg that your more than Imperial  
 Majesty will forgive me. I protest before God and his Saints that I do not  
 propose to insert any writings in this present Epistle that will be contrary  
 to the true Catholic faith, whilst consulting the astronomical calculations  
 to the best of my ability. 
 </p><p>
 Such is the extent of time past, subject to correction by the most learned  
 judgment, that the first man, Adam, came 1,242 years before Noah (not  
 reckoning by such Gentile calculations as Varro used, but simply by the Holy  
 Scriptures, as best my weak understanding and astronomical calculations can  
 interpret them.) About 1,080 years after Noah and the universal flood came  
 Abraham, who, according to some, was a first-rate astrologer and invented the  
 Chaldean alphabet. About 515 or 516 years later came Moses, and from his time  
 to that of David about 570 years elapsed. From the time of David to that of  
 out Savior and Redeemer, Jesus Christ, born of the unique Virgin, 1,350 year  
 elapsed, according to some chronographs. Some may object that this  
 calculation cannot be true, because it differs from that of Eusebius. From  
 the time of the human redemption to the detestable heresy of the Saracens  
 about 621 years elapsed. From this one can easily add up the amount of time  
 gone by. 
 </p><p>
 Although my calculations may not hold good for all nations, they have,  
 however, been determined by the celestial movements, combined with the  
 emotion, handed down to me by my forebears, which comes over me at certain  
 hours. But the danger of the times, O Most Serene King, requires that such  
 secrets should not be bared except in enigmatic sentences having, however,  
 only one sense and meaning, and nothing ambiguous or amphibological inserted.  
 Rather they are under a cloudy obscurity, with a natural infusion not unlike  
 the creation of the world, according to the calculation and Punic Chronicle  
 of Joel: I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh and your sons and daughters  
 will prophesy. But such Prophecy proceeded from the mouth of the Holy Ghost  
 who was the sovereign and eternal power, together with the heavens, and  
 caused some of them to predict great and marvelous events. 
 </p><p>
 As for myself, I would never claim such a title, never, please God. I readily  
 admit that all proceeds from God and render to Him thanks, honor and immortal  
 praise. I have mixed therewith no divination coming from fate. All from God  
 and nature, and for the most part integrated with celestial movements. It is  
 much like seeing in a burning mirror, with clouded vision, the great events,  
 sad, prodigious and calamitous events that in due time will fall upon the  
 principal worshippers. First, upon the temples of God; secondly, upon those  
 who, sustained by the earth, approach such a decadence. Also a thousand other  
 calamitous events which will be known to happen in due time. 
 </p><p>
 For God will take notice of the long barrenness of the great dame, who  
 thereupon will conceive two principal children. But she will be in danger,  
 and the female to whom she will have given birth will also, because of the  
 temerity of the age, be in danger of death in her eighteenth year, and will  
 be unable to live beyond her thirty-sixth year. She will leave three males,  
 and one female, and of these two will not have had the same father. 
 </p><p>
 There will be great differences between the three brothers, and then there  
 will be such great cooperation and agreement between them that the three and  
 four parts of Europe will tremble. The youngest of them will sustain and  
 augment the Christian monarchy, and under him sects will be elevated, and  
 suddenly cast down, Arabs will be driven back, kingdoms united and new laws  
 promulgated. 
 </p><p>
 The oldest one will rule the land whose escutcheon is that of the furious  
 crowned lions with their paws resting upon intrepid arms. 
 </p><p>
 The one second in age, accompanied by the Latins, will penetrate far, until  
 a second furious and trembling path has been beaten to the Great St. Bernard  
 Pass. From there he will descend to mount the Pyrenees, which will not,  
 however, be transferred to the French crown. And this third one will cause a  
 great inundation of human blood, and for a long time Lent will not include  
 March. 
 </p><p>
 The daughter will be given for the preservation of the Christian Church. Her  
 lord will fall into the pagan sect of the new infidels. Of her two children,  
 one will be faithful to the Catholic Church, the other an infidel. 
 </p><p>
 The unfaithful son, who, to his great confusion and later repentance, will  
 want to ruin her, will have three widely scattered regions, namely, the Roman, 
 Germany and Spain, which will set up diverse sects by armed force. The 50th  
 to the 52th degree of latitude will be left behind. 
 </p><p>
 And all will render the homage of ancient religions to the region of Europe  
 north of the 48th parallel. The latter will have trembled first in vain  
 timidity but afterwards the regions to its west, south and east will tremble.  
 But the nature of their power will be such that what has been brought about  
 by concord and union will prove insuperable by warlike conquests. 
 </p><p>
 In nature they will be equal, but very different in faith. 
 </p><p>
 After this the barren Dame, of greater power than the second, will be  
 received by two of the nations. First, by them made obstinate by the onetime  
 masters of the universe. Second, by the latter themselves. 
 </p><p>
 The third people will extend their forces towards the circuit of the East of  
 Europe where, in the Pannonias, they will be overwhelmed and slaughtered. By  
 sea they will extend their Myrmidons and Germans to Adriatic Sicily. But they  
 will succumb wholly and the Barbarian sect will be greatly afflicted and  
 driven out by all the Latins. 
 </p><p>
 Then the great Empire of the Antichrist will begin where once was Attila's  
 empire and the new Xerxes will descend with great and countless numbers, so  
 that the coming of the Holy Ghost, proceeding from the 48th degree, will make  
 a transmigration, chasing out the abomination of the Christian Church, and  
 whose reign will be for a time and to the end of time.  
 </p><p>
 This will be preceded by a solar eclipse more dark and gloomy than any since  
 the creation of the world, except that after the death and passion of Jesus  
 Christ. And it will be in the month of October than the great translation  
 will be made and it will be such that one will think the gravity of the earth  
 has lost its natural movement and that it is to be plunged into the abyss of  
 perpetual darkness. 
 </p><p>
 In the spring there will be omens, and thereafter extreme changes, reversals  
 of realms and mighty earthquakes. These will be accompanied by the  
 procreation of the new Babylon, miserable daughter enlarged by the  
 abomination of the first holocaust. It will last for only seventy-three  
 years and seven months. 
 </p><p>
 Then there will issue from the stock which had remained barren for so long,  
 proceeding from the 50th degree, one who will renew the whole Christian  
 Church. A great place will be established, with union and concord between  
 some of the children of opposite ideas, who have been separated by diverse  
 realms. And such will be the peace that the instigator and promoter of  
 military factions, born of the diversity of religions, will remain chained to  
 the deepest pit. And the kingdom of the Furious One, who counterfeits the  
 sage, will be united. 
 </p><p>
 The countries, towns, cities, realms and provinces which will have abandoned  
 their old customs to gain liberty, but which will in fact have enthralled  
 themselves even more, will secretly have wearied of their liberty. Faith lost  
 in their perfect religion, they will begin to strike to the left, only to  
 return to the right. Holiness, for a long time overcome, will be replaced in  
 accordance with the earliest writings. 
 </p><p>
 Thereafter the great dog, the biggest of curs, will go forth and destroy all, 
 the same old crimes being perpetrated again. Temples will be set up again as  
 in ancient times, and the priest will be restored to his original position  
 and he will begin his whoring and luxury, and will commit a thousand crimes. 
 </p><p>
 At the eve of another desolation, when she is atop her most high and sublime  
 dignity, some potentates and warlords will confront her, and take away her  
 two swords, and leave her only the insignia, whose curvature attracts them.  
 The people will make him go to the right and will not wish to submit  
 themselves to those of the opposite extreme with the hand in acute position,  
 who touch the ground, and want to drive spurs into them. 
 </p><p>
 The people of the world from this benevolent slavery to which they had  
 voluntary submitted. He will put himself under the protection of Mars,  
 stripping Jupiter of all his honors and dignities, and establish himself  
 in the free city in another scant Mesopotamia. The chief and governor will  
 be cast out from the middle and hung up, ignorant of the conspiracy of one  
 of the conspirators with the second Thrasibulus, who for a long time will  
 have directed all this. 
 </p><p>
 Then the impurities and abominations, with a great shame, will be brought  
 out and manifested in the shadows of the veiled light, and will cease towards  
 the end of the change in reign. The chiefs of the Church will be backward in  
 the love of God, and several of them will apostatize from the true faith. Of  
 the three sects, that which is in the middle, because of its own partisans,  
 will be thrown a bit into decadence. The first one will be exterminated  
 throughout all Europe and most of Africa by the third one, making use of the  
 poor in spirit who, led by madmen to libidinous luxury, will adulterate. 
 </p><p>
 The supporting common people will rise up and chase out the adherents of the  
 legislators. From the way realms will have been weakened by the Easterners,  
 it will seem that God the Creator has loosed Satan from the prisons of hell  
 to give birth to the great Dog and Dogam, who will make such an abominable  
 breach in the Churches that neither the reds nor the whites without eyes or  
 hands will know what to make of it, and their power will be taken from them. 
 </p><p>
 Then will commence a persecution of the Churches the like of which was never  
 seen. Meanwhile, such a plague will arise that more than two thirds of the  
 world will be removed. One will be unable to ascertain the true owners of  
 fields and houses, and weeds growing in the streets of cities will rise  
 higher than the knees. For the clergy there will be but utter desolation. The  
 warlords will usurp what is returned from the City of the Sun, from Malta and  
 the Isles of Hyhres. The great chain of the port which wakes its name from  
 the marine ox will be opened. 
 </p><p>
 And a new incursion will be made by the maritime shores, wishing to deliver  
 the Sierra Morea from the first Mahometan recapture. Their assaults will not  
 all be in vain, and the place which was once the abode of Abraham will be  
 assaulted by persons who hold the Jovialists in veneration. And this city of  
 "Achem" will be surrounded and assailed on all sides by a most powerful force 
 of warriors. Their maritime forces will be weakened by the Westerners, and  
 great desolation will fall upon this realm. Its greatest cities will be  
 depopulated and those who enter will fall under the vengeance of the wrath  
 of God. 
 </p><p>
 The sepulcher, for long an object of such great veneration, will remain in  
 the open, exposed to the sight of the heavens, the Sun and the Moon. The holy  
 place will be converted into a stable for a herd large and small, and used  
 for profane purposes. Oh, what a calamitous affliction will pregnant women  
 bear at this time. 
 </p><p>
 For hereupon the principal Eastern chief will be vanquished by the  
 Northerners and Westerners, and most of his people, stirred up, will be put  
 to death, overwhelmed or scattered. His children, offspring of many women,  
 will be imprisoned. Then will be accomplished the prophecy of the Royal  
 Prophet, Let him hear the groaning of the captives, that he might deliver the  
 children of those doomed to die.  
 </p><p>
 What great oppression will then fall upon the Princes and Governors of  
 Kingdoms, especially those which will be maritime and Eastern, whose tongues  
 will be intermingled with all others: the tongue of the Latins, and of the  
 Arabs, via the Phoenicians. And all these Eastern Kings will be chased,  
 overthrown and exterminated, but not altogether, by means of the forces of  
 the Kings of the North, and because of the drawing near of our age through  
 the three secretly united in the search for death, treacherously laying traps  
 for one another. This renewed Triumvirate will last for seven years, and the  
 renown of this sect will extend around the world. The sacrifice of the hole  
 and immaculate Wafer will be sustained. 
 </p><p>
 Then the Lords of "Aquilon" [the North], two in number, will be victorious  
 over the Easterners, and so great a noise and bellicose tumult will they  
 make amongst them that all the East will tremble in terror of these brothers, 
 yet not brothers, of "Aquilon" [the North]. 
 </p><p>
 By this discourse, Sire, I present these predictions almost with confusion,  
 especially as to when they will take place. Furthermore, the chronology of  
 time which follows conforms very little, if at all, with that which has  
 already been set forth. Yet it was determined by astronomy and other sources,  
 including Holy Scriptures, and thus could not err. If I had wanted to date  
 each quatrain, I could have done so. But this would not have been agreeable  
 to all, least of all to those interpreting them, and was not to be done until  
 Your Majesty granted me full power to do so, lest calumniators be furnished  
 with an opportunity to injure me. 
 </p><p>
 Anyhow, I count the years from the creation of the world to the birth of Noah  
 as 1,506, and from the birth of Noah to the completion of the Ark, at the  
 time of the universal deluge, as 600 (let the years be solar, or lunar, or a  
 mixture of the ten) I hold that the Sacred Scriptures use solar years. And  
 at the end of these 600 years, Noah entered the Ark to be saved from the  
 deluge. This deluge was universal, and lasted one year and two months. And  
 295 years elapsed from the end of the flood to the birth of Abraham, and 100  
 from then till the birth of Isaac. And 60 years later Jacob was born. 130  
 years elapsed between the time he entered Egypt and the time he came out.  
 Between the entry of Jacob into Egypt and the exodus, 430 years passed. From  
 the exodus to the building of the Temple by Solomon in the fourth year of  
 his reign, 480 years. According to the calculations of the Sacred Writings,  
 it was 490 years from the building of the Temple to the time of Jesus Christ.  
 Thus, this calculation of mine, collected from the holy writ, comes to about  
 4,173 years and 8 months, more or less. Because there is such a diversity of  
 sects, I will not go beyond Jesus Christ. 
 </p><p>
 I have calculated the present prophecies according to the order of the chain  
 which contains its revolution, all by astronomical doctrine modified by my  
 natural instinct. After a while, I found the time when Saturn turns to enter  
 on April 7 till August 25, Jupiter on June 14 till October 7, Mars from April  
 17 to June 22, Venus from April 9 to May 22, Mercury from February 3 to  
 February 24. After that, from June 1 to June 24, and from September 25 to  
 October 16, Saturn in Capricorn, Jupiter in Aquarius, Mars in Scorpio, Venus  
 in Pisces, Mercury for a month in Capricorn, Aquarius and Pisces, the Moon  
 in Aquarius, the Dragon's head in Libra: its tail in opposition following a  
 conjunction of Jupiter and Mercury with a quadrature of Mars and Mercury,  
 and the Dragon's head coinciding with a conjunction of the Sun and Jupiter.  
 And the year without an eclipse peaceful. 
 </p><p>
 But not everywhere. It will mark the commencement of what will long endure.  
 For beginning with this year the Christian Church will be persecuted more  
 fiercely than it ever was in Africa, and this will last up to the year 1792,  
 which they will believe to mark a renewal of time. 
 </p><p>
 After this the Roman people will begin to re-establish themselves, chasing  
 away some obscure shadows and recovering a bit of their ancient glory. But  
 this will not be without great division and continual changes. Thereafter  
 Venice will raise its wings very high in great force and power, not far  
 short of the might of ancient Rome. 
 </p><p>
 At that time the great sails of Byzantium, allied with the Ligurians and  
 through the support and power of "Aquilon" [the Northern Realm], will impede  
 them so greatly that the two Cretans will be unable to maintain their faith.  
 The arks built by the Warriors of ancient times will accompany them to the  
 waves of Neptune. In the Adriatic great discord will arise, and that which  
 will have been united will be separated. To a house will be reduced that  
 which was, and is, a great city, including "Pampotamia" and "Mesopotamia" of  
 Europe at 45, and others of 41, 42 and 37 degrees. 
 </p><p>
 It will be at this time and in these countries that the infernal power will  
 set the power of its adversaries against the Church of Jesus Christ. This  
 will constitute of the second Antichrist, who will persecute that Church and  
 its true Vicar, by means of the power of three temporal kings who in their  
 ignorance will be seduced by tongues which, in the hands of the madmen, will  
 cut more than any sword. 
 </p><p>
 The said reign of the Antichrist will last only to the death of him who was  
 born at the beginning of the age and of the other one of Lyon, associated  
 with the elected one of the House of Modena and of Ferrara, maintained by  
 the Adriatic Ligurians and the proximity of great Sicily. Then the Great St.  
 Bernard will be passed. 
 </p><p>
 The Gallic Ogmios will be accompanied by so great a number that the Empire  
 of his great law will extend very far. For some time thereafter the blood of  
 the Innocent will be shed profusely by the recently elevated guilty ones.  
 Then, because of great floods, the memory of things contained in these  
 instruments will suffer incalculable loss, even letters. This will happen to  
 the "Aquiloners" [the Northern People] by the will of God. 
 </p><p>
 Once again Satan will be bound, universal peace will be established among  
 men, and the Church of Jesus Christ will be delivered from all tribulations,  
 although the Philistines would like to mix in the honey of malice and their  
 pestilent seduction. This will be near the seventh millenary, when the  
 sanctuary of Jesus Christ will no longer be trodden down by the infidels  
 who come from "Aquilon" [the North]. The world will be approaching a great  
 conflagration, although, according to my calculations in my prophecies, the  
 course of time runs much further. 
 </p><p>
 In the Epistle that some years ago I dedicated to my son, Cisar Nostradamus,  
 I declared some points openly enough, without presage. But here, Sire, are  
 included several great and marvelous events which those to come after will  
 see. 
 </p><p>
 During this astrological supputation, harmonized with the Holy Scriptures,  
 the persecution of the Ecclesiastical folk will have its origin in the power  
 of the Kings of "Aquilon" [the North], united with the Easterners. This  
 persecution will last for eleven years, or somewhat less, for then the chief  
 King of "Aquilon" will fall. 
 </p><p>
 Thereupon the same thing will occur in the South, where for the space of  
 three years the Church people will be persecuted even more fiercely through  
 the Apostatic seduction of one who will hold all the absolute power in the  
 Church militant. The hole people of God, the observer of his law, will be  
 persecuted fiercely and such will be their affliction that the blood of the  
 true Ecclesiastics will flow everywhere. 
 </p><p>
 One of the horrible temporal Kings will be told by his adherents, as the  
 ultimate in praise, that he has shed more of human blood of Innocent  
 Ecclesiastics than anyone else could have spilled of wine. This King will  
 commit incredible crimes against the Church. Human blood will flow in the  
 public streets and temples, like water after an impetuous rain, coloring the  
 nearby rivers red with blood. The ocean itself will be reddened by another  
 naval battle, such that one king will say to another, Naval battles have  
 caused the sea to blush.  
 </p><p>
 Then, in this same year, and in those following, there will ensue the most  
 horrible pestilence, made more stupendous by the famine which will have  
 preceded it. Such great tribulations will never have occurred since the  
 first foundation of the Christian Church. It will cover all Latin regions,  
 and will leave traces in some countries of the Spanish. 
 </p><p>
 Thereupon the third King of "Aquilon" [the North], hearing the lament of the  
 people of his principal title, will raise a very mighty army and, defying  
 the tradition of his predecessors, will put almost everything back in its  
 proper place, and the great Vicar of the hood will be put back in his former  
 state. But desolated, and then abandoned by all, he will turn to find the  
 Holy of Holies destroyed by paganism, and the old and new Testaments thrown  
 out and burned. 
 </p><p>
 After that Antichrist will be the infernal prince again, for the last time.  
 All the Kingdoms of Christianity will tremble, even those of the infidels,  
 for the space of twenty-five years. Wars and battles will be more grievous  
 and towns, cities, castles and all other edifices will be burned, desolated  
 and destroyed, with great effusion of vestal blood, violations of married  
 woman and widows, and sucking children dashed and broken against the walls  
 of towns. By means of Satan, Prince Infernal, so may evils will be committed  
 that nearly all the world will find itself undone and desolated. Before  
 these events, some rare birds will cry in the air: Hui, Hui [Today, today]  
 and some time later will vanish. 
 </p><p>
 After this has endured for a long time, there will be almost renewed another  
 reign of Saturn, and golden age. Hearing the affliction of his people, God  
 the Creator will command that Satan be cast into the depths of the bottomless  
 pit, and bound there. Then a universal peace will commence between God and  
 man, and Satan will remain bound for around a thousand years, and then all  
 unbound. 
 </p><p>
 All these figures represent the just integration of Holy Scriptures with  
 visible celestial bodies, namely, Saturn, Jupiter, Mars and others conjoined,  
 as can be seen at more length in some of the quatrains. I would have  
 calculated more profoundly and integrated them even further, Most Serene  
 King, but for the fact that some given to censure would raise difficulties.  
 Therefore I withdraw my pen and seek nocturnal repose. 
 </p><p>
 Many events, most powerful of all Kings, of the most astounding sort are to  
 transpire soon, but I neither could nor would fit them all into this epistle; 
 but in order to comprehend certain horrible facts, a few must be set forth.  
 So great is your grandeur and humanity before men, and your piety before the  
 gods, that you alone seem worthy of the great title of the Most Christian  
 King, and to whom the highest authority in all religion should be deferred.  
 </p><p>
 But I shall only beseech you, Most Clement King, by this singular and prudent 
 humanity of yours, to understand rather the desire of my heart, and the  
 sovereign wish I have to obey Your Most Serene Majesty, ever since my eyes  
 approached your solar splendor, than the grandeur of my labor can attain to  
 or acquire. From Salon, this 27th of June, 1558.
