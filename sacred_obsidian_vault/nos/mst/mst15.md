 <p><a name="page_337"><font size="1" color="green">p. 337</font></a></p>  <h3 align="center">CHAPTER THREE</h3>  <h3 align="center">In the Twentieth Century</h3>  
 <p>As THIS LAST CHAPTER IS BEING assembled with the horrid word "deadline"--Oh, anathema to writers!--ringing in the author's ears, one portion of her attention is on the radio, one on the newspaper, and the rest on the ancient quatrains, written so long ago, and yet so full of meaning for those who live in the present day. Today's news is in the prophecies of the <i>Centuries</i>. Russia and England are now fighting on the same side, while war rages in the Orient, just as Nostradamus predicted. Before this book is off the presses, more striking predictions may have seen fulfillment. And perhaps there will be verses, omitted here because their meaning was not yet clear, which will have become clear through the rapid onrush of events. It is difficult to indicate chronological sequence in events of the future, and any interpreter's confusion on this point in unavoidable. Nostradamus may have juggled order to further mask identification and meaning. Also many of the quatrains had to be omitted for lack of space. Those most pertinent to our time, and to the development</p>  
 <p><a name="page_338"><font size="1" color="green">p. 338</font></a></p>  
 <p>of the future, are given first consideration here.</p>  
 <p>The final chapter of the historic cycle of the Nostradamus predictions is naturally the most exciting to us who live in the midst of its predicted alarms and tragic drama and can foresee, in part, some of the fearsome days of the future. Nostradamus has given in the course of the Centuries many dates, both actual years and astronomically stated times. He has not given, directly, the date for the emergence of France from her yoke of bondage. But in the opinion of this author he has given it in the number of his verses, one of the cryptic methods which he enjoyed using for his half-concealments. The final edition of his work contained ten Centuries which by right should have totaled a thousand quatrains. There were but nine hundred and forty-four. If one takes these two facts as giving the elements of a historic date, and adds them, the date is 1944.</p>  
 <p>This is not to be taken, however, as the date for the crowning of a new king of France, but rather perhaps of his coming to the fore, or raising the royal standard, together with a new attitude in France. In other words, it is the turning point. Several verses indicate that the stabilization of Europe, and the fullness of a new king's power will not come until 1952-3.</p>  
 <p>The present Pretender to the French throne is Henri, Duc de Guise. He corresponds in the facts of his life to the description given by the prophet of the coming king. The last king of his line, he would be the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_339"><font size="1" color="green">p. 339</font></a></p>  
 <p>first to bear the name Henry since the founder of the Bourbon dynasty, Henry of Navarre, and would complete the cycle of the house of Bourbon-Orleans, whose first ruler was born within the lifetime of Nostradamus.</p>  <h4 align="center">1914 AND ITS CONSEQUENCES</h4>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">A horrible war in the Occident draws near.<br> The year following its outbreak there will be a scourge<br> So powerful and terrible that young, old and livestock will be affected.<br> There will be blood and battle when Mercury, Mars and Jupiter are in France.</div>  
 <p>In March, 1915, the second year of World War I, these three planets were in conjunction in Pisces; the Sun, in the chart of the Third Republic, is in the ninth degree of Virgo, the opposing sign to that of the conjunction. The full Moon of that month, occurring March 1st, on the day of the second battle of Ypres, fell on nine of Virgo, exactly on the Sun of the Republic.</p>  
 <p>The new Moon of the 15th of March fell in Pisces, thus giving emphasis to the other planets in that sign which, since it is opposite Virgo, is the house of enemies of the government, and of war. It is in the precision of such details as this that the vision of Nostradamus seems the most fabulous. For vision it was. No</p>  
 <p><a name="page_340"><font size="1" color="green">p. 340</font></a></p>  
 <p>astrologer on earth, lacking the chart of the Republic (and it was then of course unborn), could have made a forecast based upon it.</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">A bridge made of small boats will be quickly built (pontoons)<br> To attack the great Prince of the Belgians.<br> There will be fighting in trenches not far from Brussels,<br> They (the enemy) will outstrip him, putting seven at a time to the sword.</div>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">After a considerable period of plenty (forty-four years)<br> The sky will touch the country around Rheims.<br> Oh, what bloody conflict raging around the people of this locality, draws near.<br> Nor fathers, nor sons, nor rulers will dare go near it.</div>  
 <p>Around Rheims, center of the two battles of the Marne, the artillery duel developed such clouds of smoke that the sky seemed to touch the land, and the horror of so many dead deterred even relatives and officials from the agony of the place. The prophet's picture is as accurate as it is harrowing.</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Fugitives, aerial warfare above the bayonets,<br> Sportive ravens neighboring the conflict,<br> The cry goes up from earth for heavenly aid and rescue<br> When the fighting comes close to the walls (of Paris).</div>

The swelling wave will touch them,<br> Hunger and thirst will deplete them, even the weakest will be under armes.</div>  
 <p>In 1917 a shot from a Big Bertha killed people in a church in Paris. The Seine was very high that year, at times touching the walls.</p>  
 <p align="center">VIII-48</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Saturn in Cancer, Jupiter with Mars,<br> A university professor, wise as a Chaldean seer, under <a name="page_342"><font size="1" color="green">p. 342</font></a> the aegis of a vigorous young nation, with the fullest round measure will save the country in February.<br> There will be the fall of Château-fort, and assault on three fronts.<br> The conflict will take place near Serbia. It is a mortal war.</div>  
 <p>Saturn was in Cancer throughout the first six months of 1917, leaving the sign at the end of June. On the 3rd of February Woodrow Wilson broke off diplomatic relations with Germany. In June Mars and Jupiter came to conjunction when the first American contingent of troops sailed for France. Nothing could be more precise than this astronomical timing of the period from the first cheering announcement to France of the break which meant this country was coming in, to the sailing of the first troops of the A.E.F. to "save the land."</p>  
 <p>Nostradamus made use of a triple anagram to characterize President Wilson, which is a triumph of ingenuity and condensation.</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The inhabitants of the isles (Britain) will be blockaded for a long time.<br> They will summon their vigor and might against the enemies.<br> Those outside shall die, defeated by hunger.<br> They will experience a greater hunger than they have ever known.</div>

 <p>The battle of Jutland is very well indicated in these two verses and the device of camouflage is duly observed by the prophet.</p>

 <p>An illustration in the <i>Jour</i>, for the 26th of February, 1937, showed coins of 1914 as a full moon, those for 1918 as half moon, those for 1936, a quarter</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">When the kingdom is divided and quarreling over the brothers,<br> One of them will take the arms and name of Britain.<br> The English title (of the other) will be tardily considered.<br> Night overtaking him, he will leave for France.</div>  
 <p>These are the events around the abdication of Edward VIII.</p>

 <p>In the papal elections of 1922 many thought that the papacy would go to the Spanish cardinal, Merry del Val. It was given instead to Monsignor Ratti, Pius XI, who though Italian, came from what was anciently Cisalpine Gaul.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_347"><font size="1" color="green">p. 347</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">V-92</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">After the elevation to the papacy, which will last for seventeen years,<br> Five will change in the revolution of this term,<br> Then one will be elected from the same time<br> Who will not be very conformable to the Romans.</div>  
 <p>Pope Pius XI reigned seventeen years. The five governments which underwent changes in his time were Italy, Germany, Austria, Czechoslovakia and Spain. Pius XII is not too "conformable" to Mussolini's ideas.</p>  
 <p align="center">*</p>  <h4 align="center">THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS</h4>  
 <p align="center">V-13</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">Near Lake Leman there will be a house of prostitution<br> Presided over by a foreign woman, who will seek to betray the city.<br> Before she is murdered by the Germans, there will be a great flight.<br> Then those from the Rhineland will begin their invasion.</div>  
 <p>The house is the League of Nations, run by foreign policies. Nostradamus, as we have seen, in earlier quatrains here included, did not trust the League.</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The King will desire to enter into the New City<br> But his enemies will eventually drive him out.<br> A captive, he will be free. False things will be spoken and perpetrated.<br> The King, living outside, will keep himself aloof from his enemies.</div>

 <p>Yes, that was the time they imposed the Italian sanctions and the British fleet backed down.</p>

 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">For a long time in the sky a gray bird will be seen Near<br> Dole and the land of Tuscany<br> Holding in its beak a green branch.<br> Soon the great man will die and he will conclude the war.</div>  
 <p>The reference to the dove and the olive branch of the League of Nations seems to close with a reference to the death of Woodrow Wilson. Perhaps the exigencies of rhyme induced the prophet to mention his concluding war, after the man "will die". The meaning is clear enough, but cart-before-horse.</p>  
 <p align="center">II-23</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The palace birds will be driven off by another bird (German eagle)<br> Soon after the prince (Hitler) comes into power.<br> How many times that enemy (Germany) has been driven back across the river (Rhine). <a name="page_350"><font size="1" color="green">p. 350</font></a><br> Caught outside its own country the tether of the bird has been seized and held.</div>

 <p>The two besieged, or limited, by the League, are Hitler and Mussolini quenching their thirst for power</p>  
 <p><a name="page_351"><font size="1" color="green">p. 351</font></a></p>  
 <p>with Czechoslovakia and Ethiopia. The strong man is Daladier; the dreamer, Chamberlain.</p>

 <p align="center">II-40</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">A little later, but no great interval,<br> By land and sea will come the great tumult.<br> Naval warfare on a scale greater than ever<br> With explosions and guns will increase the onslaught.</div>

 <p>One can only say that the comparison of Mussolini to Aretino is unflattering to the early journalist and satirist.</p>  
 <p align="center">*</p>  <h4 align="center">THE SPANISH REVOLUTION</h4>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">The Greek dame of despicable beauty<br> With her lucky achievement of innumerable civil processes,<br> Will be imported into Spain,<br> Where she will be captured and perish miserably.</div>  
 <p>Because of the Greek ideas which characterized the French Revolution and Directorate, foreseen by Nostradamus, he usually calls a government <i>la dame</i>, and uses throughout the <i>Centuries</i> the Greek Woman, or Castula to signify it. Here he sees the importation of democratic principles into Spain, crystallized in the Spanish Republic.</p>  
 <p align="center">I-19</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">When they shall complete the area of the Coffin<br> The Spaniards will make trouble for their aristocratic blood.<br> Their population will be greatly decimated, <a name="page_353"><font size="1" color="green">p. 353</font></a><br> Their leader will be in flight, hidden by the troughs of blood.</div>  
 <p>The author has seen a newspaper reference to the flight of the late ex-King, Alfonso, in a boat carrying a cargo of fresh-killed meat, but cannot cite the reference.</p>  
 <p>The reference to the Coffin area is fascinating. Bertina Harding, in <i>The Phantom Crown</i>, tells how young Maximilian visited the tombs of his ancestors while in Spain in 1856. "The mystery of Philip II's oracle confronted him. In the octagon-shaped chamber, at the center of the mausoleum, the eccentric monarch had fitted out a permanent abode for his embalmed ancestors. That was not all. After providing accommodation for ten defunct forebears, he had added with dreadful insight, space for as many crowned successors to himself as he deemed probable. Tier on tier the marble coffins stood, thirty in all. And only three were empty . . . but the Queen, Isabella II, was fitting up a nursery in her palace at Madrid for this expected heir, Alfonso XII. Would there then be but one more Alfonso? A thirteenth? The Archduke fell into uncomfortable reflections while a phlegmatic guide rattled a bunch of keys.</p>  
 <p>"'When they are quite full', the man said, pointing at the coffins, 'we will get the Republic.'"</p>  
 <p>The construction of the tombs (the Coffin) was probably begun by Philip II during the lifetime of Nostradamus.</p>

 <p align="center">*</p>  <h4 align="center">THE SECOND GREAT WAR</h4>  
 <p align="center">II-56</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">When corruption and massacre have not put a stop to the situation<br> And there is death in the bomb-craters struck from high heaven,<br> The head of the Church will die when he sees the ruin<br> And those who are shipwrecked clinging to the rock.</div>

 <p>The meaning of this is that the old gods and myths revived will dominate human action. Such a revival has been seen in Germany, and Hitler's belief in his relationship to the figures in Wagnerian drama is well known to all readers of magazines and newspapers today. The left hand meant in the prophet's day, not Communism but peace or <a href="errata.htm#14">pacifism</a>. This verse, from a man of peace, is a powerful indictment of the prewar policy of his country.</p>  
 <p>Interesting is the phraseology of a <i>New York Times</i> editorial (June 22, 1941) on the subject of myths, commenting on a speech by President Conant, of Harvard: "President Conant's new nihilists are the people who believe in the Myth as the great motive force in history.

 <p>Saturn in Aries is associated with acquisitiveness. The prophet appears here to indicate the period of January 1938, when Saturn entered the sign and Mercury became direct in Sagittarius, to January of 1939 when Saturn turned direct preparatory to leaving the sign, and again Mercury was in the Archer's sign. Nostradamus pays close attention to the times when the planets change from retrograde to direct motion, as did all of the older astrologers who would have noted these details in the prophet's mention of astronomical timing. This time was a period of new and grave economic problems for both Italy, which had not then entered the war, and for the United States whose economic policy, born of the war, was not then fully formulated. The death of a pope during this period would have been felt by Nostradamus as a further deep affliction to Italy.</p>

 <p>This verse seems to describe 1940 in the spring, when Mussolini's agents were active on all fronts before his entrance into the war. He of the Calf is Hitler born under Taurus, sign of the Bull, Ox or Calf. The prophet here implies that he is not only Taurus, but the Golden Calf as well. He, Hitler, was, as one recalls, busily explaining that he had nothing against the French--only their government.</p>

 <p>This warlike conjunction will occur on November 12, 1947.

 <p>It has been noted that Hitler, who was inspired by Mussolini's success, has consistently surrounded himself with seven leaders who carry out his orders and develop his ideas. Whether this is happenstance or related to some of his ideas on occultism is not known, but the number seven has some association with the occult in the minds of many and its legends are very ancient.</p>

 <p>This very well describes conditions after the fall of France. The author does not know the exact number of members of the former government now dead or imprisoned at Rion; but it is close on seven. France, through Clemenceau, was responsible for the peace of Versailles.</p>

 <p>This verse is as puzzling as it is intriguing. The Bellerophon was the ship that took Napoleon to Saint Helena. Here it is a symbol of England. Classically, Bellerophon was a hero who retired after involuntarily causing the death of Praytus, his friend and hunting companion, while both were guests in the house of Praytus' father-in-law. The meaning could be that England allied with a government of France, the Republic (which is not the true son of France but an in-law), while both are guests of France, will meet tragedy; that England (at Dunquerque) will be responsible for the death of (Praytus) the French government.</p>  
 <p>Then the symbolism changes, and seems to indicate Britannia, "for a thousand years" a sea-going power from the days of William the Conqueror, will taste defeat, and thereafter both Britain and her antagonist, Germany, the crossed brother, will perish.</p>

 <p>Rudolf Hess is said to have fled because his mind was troubled at the thought of occupation and war in the Holy Land which shocked his Catholicism. The horned bull is Hitler, the Taurean, who has brought the war to the Holy Land.</p>  
 <p>When the <i>Robin Moo</i>r was sunk the <i>New York World-Telegram</i> carried a story from the survivors which stated that the submarine hoisted no flag, but was painted with the large device of a red bull.

 <p>This triple conjunction last occurred September 2nd, 1940, just before the invasion of Greece.</p>  
 <p>Nostradamus lived too near the time of Jeanne d’Arc, and he was too passionately French, to feel other than jealousy and distrust of England, a power which he saw steadily expanding through centuries to greater possessions than his own nation. From early times a prophecy of the downfall of England had been handed down from the Welsh prophet, Merlin. Eustache Deschamps, the French bard of the early fifteenth century, used the Merlin prophecy in one of his satiric poems. Nostradamus has come very near to</p>  
 <p><a name="page_377"><font size="1" color="green">p. 377</font></a></p>  
 <p>copying it. Both of these troubadours hoped Merlin was right, and, because of that, one may perhaps discount something of the gloom that hangs about Nostradamus’ forecasts for England. The lines of Deschamps are these.</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">According to the prophet of the Isle of Giants,<br> Which has since been called Albion,<br> The people were tardily converted to a belief in God.<br> The Isle will be completely desolated.<br> Through their pride will come their day of hardship<br> Concerning which their prophet Merlin<br> Predicted their dolorous end<br> When he wrote: "you will lose life and land."<br> When that has happened, men will point out to foreigners and those from neighboring countries<br> Where in former times there was England.</div>  
 <p>Nostradamus elaborates on the theme in the following verses. No specific dates are indicated in these prophecies for England, some of which may be quite distant.</p>  
 <p align="center">X-100</p>  
 <p></p><div style="margin-left: 32px">England will be a great empire,<br> The all-powerful land surrounded by water will endure for more than three hundred years.<br> Her commerce will traverse sea and land,<br> The Portuguese will not be satisfied with that.</div>  
 <p><a name="page_378"><font size="1" color="green">p. 378</font></a></p>  
 <p>Portugal was the great maritime rival of Britain at the time Nostradamus wrote this. There is something deeply symbolic in the fact that this verse is the closing one of the <i>Centuries</i>. It is as if there were an implication that the end of England would be the end of the world as we know it. It is like the old saying about Rome: "While stands the Colosseum, Rome shall stand, when falls the Colosseum, Rome shall fall, and when Rome, falls the world." The civilized world today has a similar feeling about England and her relationship to all that is held free and precious.</p>

 <p>This is a peculiarly interesting verse. In his letter to King Henry the prophet speaks of "the great trembling of the earth together with the increase of the new Babylon, wretched daughter (of the Revolution), augmented by the abomination of the first holocaust</p>  
 <p><a name="page_385"><font size="1" color="green">p. 385</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> (1792). It will hold its power for just seventy-three years and seven months. Then there shall issue from the long barren tree (of the monarchy), born at the 50th Parallel (latitude of the Franco-Belgian border), one who will revitalize the entire Christian Church. And there shall be created a peace, union and concord between the children of opposed and separate races."</p>  
 <p>If 1944, as previously analyzed from the number of verses and Centuries (this author may possibly be alone in seeing such a connection; certainly the first to say so), it <a href="errata.htm#16">constitutes</a> Nostradamus’ date for the beginning of "France Second," over which the new and great Henry V is to rule.</p>  
 <p>If to the date of the Battle of Sedan, September 1st, 1870, the seventy-three years and seven months of the prophet are added, it brings us to March, 1944. If the seventy-three years are subtracted from the date of the downfall of Napoleon III at Sedan one gets 1797, dating the rise of Napoleon I. Napoleon III died in 1873, which is a kind of echo of the number. Nostradamus mentions, not in a prophetic connection, the Hebrew prophet Joel. This is in the letter to the King. It seemed odd to single out for no reason this one short Biblical book and not to refer to other prophets. But on looking into Joel, one discovers that the book has just three chapters and seventy-three verses. The French Republic has had three chapters too, the First, Second and Third Republics. This number 73 is a peculiar one.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_386"><font size="1" color="green">p. 386</font></a></p>  
 <p>Nostradamus gives the precise date of the French Revolution, also in the letter to the King. "Then will be seen the beginning of events of long duration, and in the first year there will be a great persecution of the Christian Church. This will break out in the year one thousand seven hundred and ninety-two. The people will think that it is a renewing of the age."</p>  
 <p>If 1792 is taken as a starting point, and two additions of the number of Joel, 73, are made, one has the date of 1938.</p>  
 <p>Returning to the quatrain, the verse of course refers to the government of Napoleon I, which returned to power under Louis Napoleon. Yet as has been shown, the verse has a much more subtle application, and the seventy-three years does not refer to the tenure of power of either man, but to cycles which included their years. The rise of one and the downfall of the other give points of reference for use of the number.</p>

 <p align="center">*</p>  <h4 align="center">DISCOVERY OF THE TOMB OF A SAINT</h4>  
 <p>The fascinating prophecy given below concerns the finding of a tomb of some early Christian saint, which is to happen in April of whatever year. The prophet does not indicate a closer date except that the "new party" will be founded upon the bones of the saint,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_404"><font size="1" color="green">p. 404</font></a></p>  
 <p>whom he calls the Great Roman. This presumably means the Christian royalist party of the coming King. The saint may possibly be one of the early Christians of the time of Trajan, who journeyed into Gaul and died there. Under Trajan the Roman Empire reached its greatest expansion of territory. It also achieved a very high and wide-spread culture. The persecution of Christians was, however, very severe. The verses seem to point to an analogy between Trajan and the imperialist ambitions of Mussolini, who is perhaps typified in the mention of Prince Ulpian. Trajan's name was Marcus Ulpius Trajan. Nostradamus’ reference to the golden lamp of Trajan would seem to mean the spiritual lamp of Christianity which, though buried under persecution, still glows in its secret place in the old Roman province, now Provence. The parallel is made by the prophet between the persecuted Christians of Trajan's day, of whom the old saint may have been one, and the modern Christians, whose lamp must also burn in secret, persecuted by dictators.</p>

 <p align="center">*</p>  <h4 align="center">THE RISE OF THE ORIENT</h4>  
 <p>The author, sometime ago, cited some of the predictions in the following verses to a well-known military commentator. He said that they were not news. That men in his particular work who were always scanning future horizons for long-range prophecies of their own had long accepted the rise of the Orient as a fait accompli of the future, and that for this reason the political forecasters gave triple attention to every item that came out of Asia and Africa. Nostradamus in his own day saw the might of the Orient and its menace to Christian Europe, and he knew that cycles return.</p>

 <p>Probably the prophet looks back from this advanced time to what is Portugal today, as this is a small country and may be incorporated in a large one. A modern French commentator, realizing its size, says, naïvely enough, that Portugal will send for the U. S. fleet!</p>

 <p align="center">*</p>  <h4 align="center">THE END OF THE AGE</h4>  
 <p>Not only ever since the Christian era, but long before in the songs and lamentations of the Hebrew prophets, the end of the great precessional era of the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_413"><font size="1" color="green">p. 413</font></a></p>  
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Fishes, Pisces, has been foretold in a wealth of tragic and saddening detail. It is not the end of the world, as many people of old times thought, but the end of a grand period, and the birth of a new age with a different type of thought and civilization. Nostradamus prophesied that it would be marked by the downfall of old Europe, and be ushered in with earthquakes and eclipses such as the Bible describes in the scene of the Crucifixion.</p>  
 <p>Science recognizes that from time to time the earth changes the inclination of its axis. They know this from fossil remains (which, for example, show that Alaska had once a warm climate, and other localities show that similar changes have taken place). But science has no knowledge of what causes this change, nor in what cycle of years its return may be expected. Nor does Nostradamus specify the date for this occurrence, but by implication he links it with the phenomenon of the double eclipse which will take place in 1999.</p>  
 <p>The two eclipses will occur in the sign Leo, a partial one on July 28th, and a total one on August 11. The event is a very rare astronomical phenomenon. Camille Flammarion wrote of it in detail. All astronomers then living will prepare to observe it with every advanced resource of scientific equipment. Nostradamus, in both his letter to the King and in his verses, has given his picture of what he predicts will affect the entire world. Science is just beginning to have an understanding of terrestrial phenomena, such as floods and earthquakes, coming as the result of celestial phenomena, the doctrine</p>  
 <p><a name="page_414"><font size="1" color="green">p. 414</font></a></p>  
 <p>held by astrologers for thousands of years. Science has arrived at some limited conclusions forced by the necessity for better long-range weather forecasting. But the study of earthquakes, floods and volcanoes, made in the light of the gravitational and magnetic strains and stresses of the Sun, Moon and planets, is still in its infancy and as yet almost nothing is known about it. The wise men of old knew these things, and Nostradamus knew them. He needed no telescope for the double eclipse, and he not only saw it, but he saw the train of events that came with it, something no giant telescope can show.</p>  
 <p>In his letter to the King the prophet has this to say of the last years of the twentieth century:</p>  
 <p>"Then shall begin the great empire of Antichrist in the invasions of Xerxes and Attila ('one who will revive the King of the Angoumois,' and the Oriental invasion) who will come with a countless throng, so that the advent of the Holy Spirit, from the 48th parallel, will make a great change and chase away the abomination of Antichrist that made war on the sovereign Vicar of Christ (the Pope) and against his Church for a time and to the end of time. This will be preceded by an eclipse of the Sun, of denser darkness than has ever been seen since the Creation and up to the passion and crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and from that time until the coming one. There will take place in the month of October a great translation made so that the earth will seem to lose the weight of its natural motion in an abyss of endless darkness. There will be premonitory</p>  
 <p><a name="page_415"><font size="1" color="green">p. 415</font></a></p>  
 <p>signs in the spring, and there will be extreme changes, overthrows of kingdoms, and earthquakes."</p>  
 <p>"In the last period all the Christian kingdoms, and those of the infidels, will be shaken for twenty-five years. The wars and battles will be more injurious. Towns, cities, castles, and other buildings will be burned, laid waste, and destroyed, with great bloodshed of vestals, violation of wives and widows, and children at the breast dashed and broken against the walls of the towns. Satan, the prince infernal, will commit so many evils that nearly the whole world will be afflicted and desolated.</p>  
 <p>"After this has endured for a certain length of time, Saturn will almost renew his cycle (twenty-nine years), but God the Creator will bring an age of gold. He will heed the affliction of His people, and He will bind Satan and throw him into the abyss. Then shall begin between God and man a universal peace, and Satan will be bound for a thousand years. Then the cycle will return in grand power, Satan will be once more unbound against the Church."</p>

 <p>This configuration occurs in April, 1998. It is in that year that Nostradamus predicts the great invasion of France. The path of the solar eclipse, which will be total, passes through northern France and Belgium.</p>

 <p>Diana is the Moon, so that Monday will be the Pope's day of rest. The Moon rules changes, travels and voyagings, and it is involved in mental frenzies and distracted mentalities. In the famous prophecy of Malachi, in his descriptions of the popes yet to come he names third before Petrus Romanus (the last one named) <i>De Medietate Lunae</i>. De Medietate Lunae means "relating to the half-Moon, which is the crescent of Diana." Malachi's further description of this pope is: "From the half-moon proceeds this pope sent to Rome by the Divine Doctor, Hail, our well-beloved Pius XII, most holy Mediator, future victim." The</p>  
 <p><a name="page_418"><font size="1" color="green">p. 418</font></a></p>  
 <p>present incumbent of the holy See is Pius XII, and more than any previous pope he has "wandered afar." But otherwise the description does not fit, nor does he come in the order given by Malachi. According to the Monk of Padua there will be two popes after the Lunar, and three more before him. Nostradamus names him as the "penultimate" pope. In the times of the Avignon popes and the Great Schism Cardinal Pietro di Luna was one of the false popes. Eustache Deschamps, a famous satiric poet of that time, whose writings were not only familiar to Nostradamus but imitated and quoted by him, wrote a satire called, "Of the Schism in the Church Which is Much Troubled by the Moon" (Luna). Some of Nostradamus’ lines are very close to lines in this satire.</p>
