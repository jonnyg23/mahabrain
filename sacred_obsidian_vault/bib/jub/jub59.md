 <p>XXVIII. And he went on his journey, and came to the land of the east, to Laban, the brother of Rebecca, and he was with him, and served him for Rachel his daughter one week. <a name="fr_678"></a><a href="#fn_676"><font size="1">1</font></a> 2. <a name="fr_679"></a><a href="#fn_677"><font size="1">2</font></a> And in the first year of the third week he said unto him: "Give </p><table align="RIGHT" width="10%" cellpadding="8">

  me my wife, for whom I have served thee seven years;" and Laban said unto Jacob. "I will give thee thy wife." 3. And Laban made a feast, and took Leah his elder daughter, and gave (her) to Jacob as a wife, and gave her Zilpah his handmaid for an handmaid; and Jacob did not know, for he thought that she was Rachel. 4. And he went in unto her, and behold, she was Leah; and Jacob was angry with Laban, and said unto him: "Why hast thou dealt thus with me? Did not I serve thee for Rachel and not for Leah? Why hast thou wronged me? Take thy daughter, and I will go; for thou hast done evil to me." 5. For Jacob loved Rachel more than Leah; for Leah's eyes were weak, but her form was very handsome; but Rachel had beautiful eyes and a beautiful and very handsome form. <a name="fr_680"></a><a href="#fn_678"><font size="1">3</font></a> 6. And Laban said to Jacob: "It is not so done in our country, to give the younger before the elder." <a name="fr_681"></a><a href="#fn_679"><font size="1">4</font></a> And it is not right to do this; for thus it is ordained and written in the heavenly tables, <a name="fr_682"></a><a href="#fn_680"><font size="1">5</font></a> that no one should give his younger daughter before the elder--but the elder one giveth first and after her the younger--and the man who doeth so, they set down guilt against him in heaven, and none is righteous that doeth this thing, for this deed is evil before the Lord.

And command thou the children of Israel that they do not this thing; let them neither take nor give the younger before they have given the elder, for it is very wicked. 8. <a name="fr_683"></a><a href="#fn_681"><font size="1">1</font></a> And Laban said to Jacob: "Let the seven days of the feast of this one pass by, and I shall give thee Rachel, <a name="fr_684"></a><a href="#fn_682"><font size="1">2</font></a> that thou mayest serve me another seven years, that thou mayest pasture my sheep as thou didst in the former week." 9. And on the day when the seven days of the feast of Leah had passed, Laban gave Rachel to Jacob, that he might serve him another seven years, and he gave to Rachel Bilhah, the sister of Zilpah <a name="fr_685"></a><a href="#fn_683"><font size="1">3</font></a> as a handmaid. 10.

And when Rachel saw that Leah had borne four sons to Jacob, Reuben and Simeon and Levi and Judah, she said unto him: "Go in unto Bilhah my handmaid, and she will conceive, and bear a son unto me." 18.

And in the days when Joseph was born, Jacob said to Laban: "Give me my wives and sons, and let me go to my father Isaac, and let me make me an house; for I have completed the years in which I have served thee for thy two daughters, and I will go to the house of my father." 26. And Laban said to Jacob: "†Tarry with me for thy wages† <a name="fr_688"></a><a href="jub60.htm#fn_686"><font size="1">1</font></a>, and pasture my flock for me again, and take thy wages." 27.

And all the sheep brought forth spotted and speckled and black, variously marked, <a name="fr_690"></a><a href="jub60.htm#fn_688"><font size="1">3</font></a> and they brought forth again lambs like themselves, and all that were spotted were Jacob's and those which were not were Laban's. 29. And Jacob's possessions multiplied exceedingly, and he possessed oxen and sheep <a name="fr_691"></a><a href="jub60.htm#fn_689"><font size="1">4</font></a> and asses and camels, and menservants and maidservants. 30. And Laban and his sons envied Jacob, and Laban took back his sheep from him, and he observed him with evil intent.
