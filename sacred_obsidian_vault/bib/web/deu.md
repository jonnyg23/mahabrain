  <h3 align="center">World English Bible: Deuteronomy</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, in the Arabah over against Suph, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth, and Dizahab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> It is eleven days' [journey] from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Kadesh Barnea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> It happened in the fortieth year, in the eleventh month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spoke to the children of Israel, according to all that Yahweh had given him in commandment to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> after he had struck Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth, at Edrei.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Beyond the Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to declare this law, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> "Yahweh our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying, You have lived long enough in this mountain:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> turn, and take your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all [the places] near there, in the Arabah, in the hill country, and in the lowland, and in the South, and by the seashore, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their seed after them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> I spoke to you at that time, saying, "I am not able to bear you myself alone:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Yahweh your God has multiplied you, and behold, you are this day as the stars of the sky for multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Yahweh, the God of your fathers, make you a thousand times as many as you are, and bless you, as he has promised you!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> How can I myself alone bear your encumbrance, and your burden, and your strife?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Take wise men of understanding and well known according to your tribes, and I will make them heads over you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> You answered me, and said, "The thing which you have spoken is good [for us] to do."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> So I took the heads of your tribes, wise men, and known, and made them heads over you, captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, and captains of fifties, and captains of tens, and officers, according to your tribes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> I commanded your judges at that time, saying, Hear [the causes] between your brothers, and judge righteously between a man and his brother, and the foreigner who is living with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear the small and the great alike; you shall not be afraid of the face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is too hard for you, you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> I commanded you at that time all the things which you should do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> We traveled from Horeb, and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw, by the way to the hill country of the Amorites, as Yahweh our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh Barnea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> I said to you, "You have come to the hill country of the Amorites, which Yahweh our God gives to us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> Behold, Yahweh your God has set the land before you: go up, take possession, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you; don't be afraid, neither be dismayed."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> You came near to me everyone of you, and said, "Let us send men before us, that they may search the land for us, and bring us word again of the way by which we must go up, and the cities to which we shall come."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> The thing pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one man for every tribe:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> and they turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the valley of Eshcol, and spied it out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> They took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought it down to us, and brought us word again, and said, "It is a good land which Yahweh our God gives to us."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> Yet you wouldn't go up, but rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> and you murmured in your tents, and said, "Because Yahweh hated us, he has brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> Where are we going up? our brothers have made our heart to melt, saying, 'The people are greater and taller than we; the cities are great and fortified up to the sky; and moreover we have seen the sons of the Anakim there.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> Then I said to you, "Don't dread, neither be afraid of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> Yahweh your God who goes before you, he will fight for you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> and in the wilderness, where you have seen how that Yahweh your God bore you, as a man does bear his son, in all the way that you went, until you came to this place."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> Yet in this thing you didn't believe Yahweh your God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> who went before you in the way, to seek you out a place to pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way you should go, and in the cloud by day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:34">1:34</a> Yahweh heard the voice of your words, and was angry, and swore, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:35">1:35</a> "Surely not one of these men of this evil generation shall see the good land, which I swore to give to your fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:36">1:36</a> except Caleb the son of Jephunneh: he shall see it; and to him will I give the land that he has trodden on, and to his children, because he has wholly followed Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:37">1:37</a> Also Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, saying, "You also shall not go in there:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:38">1:38</a> Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall go in there: encourage you him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:39">1:39</a> Moreover your little ones, whom you said should be a prey, and your children, who this day have no knowledge of good or evil, they shall go in there, and to them will I give it, and they shall possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:40">1:40</a> But as for you, turn, and take your journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:41">1:41</a> Then you answered and said to me, "We have sinned against Yahweh, we will go up and fight, according to all that Yahweh our God commanded us." Every man of you put on his weapons of war, and presumed to go up into the hill country.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:42">1:42</a> Yahweh said to me, "Tell them, 'Don't go up, neither fight; for I am not among you; lest you be struck before your enemies.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:43">1:43</a> So I spoke to you, and you didn't listen; but you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh, and were presumptuous, and went up into the hill country.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:44">1:44</a> The Amorites, who lived in that hill country, came out against you, and chased you, as bees do, and beat you down in Seir, even to Hormah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:45">1:45</a> You returned and wept before Yahweh; but Yahweh didn't listen to your voice, nor gave ear to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:46">1:46</a> So you stayed in Kadesh many days, according to the days that you stayed [there].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea, as Yahweh spoke to me; and we encircled Mount Seir many days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> "You have encircled this mountain long enough. Turn northward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Command the people, saying, 'You are to pass through the border of your brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir; and they will be afraid of you: take good heed to yourselves therefore;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> don't contend with them; for I will not give you of their land, no, not so much as for the sole of the foot to tread on; because I have given Mount Seir to Esau for a possession.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> You shall purchase food of them for money, that you may eat; and you shall also buy water of them for money, that you may drink.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> For Yahweh your God has blessed you in all the work of your hand; he has known your walking through this great wilderness: these forty years Yahweh your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> So we passed by from our brothers the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, from the way of the Arabah from Elath and from Ezion Geber. We turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Yahweh said to me, "Don't bother Moab, neither contend with them in battle; for I will not give you of his land for a possession; because I have given Ar to the children of Lot for a possession."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> (The Emim lived therein before, a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> these also are accounted Rephaim, as the Anakim; but the Moabites call them Emim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> The Horites also lived in Seir before, but the children of Esau succeeded them; and they destroyed them from before them, and lived in their place; as Israel did to the land of his possession, which Yahweh gave to them.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> "Now rise up, and cross over the brook Zered." We went over the brook Zered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> The days in which we came from Kadesh Barnea, until we were come over the brook Zered, were thirty-eight years; until all the generation of the men of war were consumed from the midst of the camp, as Yahweh swore to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Moreover the hand of Yahweh was against them, to destroy them from the midst of the camp, until they were consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> So it happened, when all the men of war were consumed and dead from among the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> that Yahweh spoke to me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> "You are this day to pass over Ar, the border of Moab:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and when you come near over against the children of Ammon, don't bother them, nor contend with them; for I will not give you of the land of the children of Ammon for a possession; because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> (That also is accounted a land of Rephaim: Rephaim lived therein before; but the Ammonites call them Zamzummim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> a people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakim; but Yahweh destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> as he did for the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites from before them; and they succeeded them, and lived in their place even to this day:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> and the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim, who came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and lived in their place.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> "Rise up, take your journey, and pass over the valley of the Arnon: behold, I have given into your hand Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> This day will I begin to put the dread of you and the fear of you on the peoples who are under the whole sky, who shall hear the report of you, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> "Let me pass through your land: I will go along by the highway, I will turn neither to the right hand nor to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> You shall sell me food for money, that I may eat; and give me water for money, that I may drink: only let me pass through on my feet,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> as the children of Esau who dwell in Seir, and the Moabites who dwell in Ar, did to me; until I shall pass over the Jordan into the land which Yahweh our God gives us."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him; for Yahweh your God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into your hand, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> Yahweh said to me, "Behold, I have begun to deliver up Sihon and his land before you: begin to possess, that you may inherit his land."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Jahaz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> Yahweh our God delivered him up before us; and we struck him, and his sons, and all his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> We took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones; we left none remaining:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> only the livestock we took for a prey to ourselves, with the spoil of the cities which we had taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> From Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, and [from] the city that is in the valley, even to Gilead, there was not a city too high for us; Yahweh our God delivered up all before us:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> only to the land of the children of Ammon you didn't come near; all the side of the river Jabbok, and the cities of the hill country, and wherever Yahweh our God forbade us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Yahweh said to me, "Don't fear him; for I have delivered him, and all his people, and his land, into your hand; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> So Yahweh our God delivered into our hand Og also, the king of Bashan, and all his people: and we struck him until none was left to him remaining.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> We took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we didn't take from them; sixty cities, all the region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> All these were cities fortified with high walls, gates, and bars; besides the unwalled towns a great many.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> We utterly destroyed them, as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every inhabited city, with the women and the little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> But all the livestock, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey to ourselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> We took the land at that time out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> ([which] Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> all the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, to Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> (For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of the Rephaim; behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; isn't it in Rabbah of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was its length, and four cubits its breadth, after the cubit of a man.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> This land we took in possession at that time: from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, and half the hill country of Gilead, and its cities, gave I to the Reubenites and to the Gadites:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> and the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, the kingdom of Og, gave I to the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, even all Bashan. (The same is called the land of Rephaim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Jair the son of Manasseh took all the region of Argob, to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and called them, even Bashan, after his own name, Havvoth Jair, to this day.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> I gave Gilead to Machir.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> To the Reubenites and to the Gadites I gave from Gilead even to the valley of the Arnon, the middle of the valley, and the border [of it], even to the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> the Arabah also, and the Jordan and the border [of it], from Chinnereth even to the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, under the slopes of Pisgah eastward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> I commanded you at that time, saying, "Yahweh your God has given you this land to possess it: you shall pass over armed before your brothers the children of Israel, all the men of valor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> But your wives, and your little ones, and your livestock, (I know that you have much livestock), shall live in your cities which I have given you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> until Yahweh gives rest to your brothers, as to you, and they also possess the land which Yahweh your God gives them beyond the Jordan: then you shall return every man to his possession, which I have given you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, "Your eyes have seen all that Yahweh your God has done to these two kings: so shall Yahweh do to all the kingdoms where you go over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> You shall not fear them; for Yahweh your God, he it is who fights for you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> I begged Yahweh at that time, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> "Lord Yahweh, you have begun to show your servant your greatness, and your strong hand: for what god is there in heaven or in earth, that can do according to your works, and according to your mighty acts?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Please let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> But Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and didn't listen to me; and Yahweh said to me, "Let it suffice you; speak no more to me of this matter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> Go up to the top of Pisgah, and lift up your eyes westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and see with your eyes: for you shall not go over this Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> But commission Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him; for he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit the land which you shall see."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> So we stayed in the valley over against Beth Peor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and to the ordinances, which I teach you, to do them; that you may live, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, gives you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> You shall not add to the word which I command you, neither shall you diminish from it, that you may keep the commandments of Yahweh your God which I command you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> Your eyes have seen what Yahweh did because of Baal Peor; for all the men who followed Baal Peor, Yahweh your God has destroyed them from the midst of you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> But you who did cling to Yahweh your God are all alive this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Behold, I have taught you statutes and ordinances, even as Yahweh my God commanded me, that you should do so in the midst of the land where you go in to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples, who shall hear all these statutes, and say, "Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> For what great nation is there, that has a god so near to them, as Yahweh our God is whenever we call on him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> What great nation is there, that has statutes and ordinances so righteous as all this law, which I set before you this day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Only take heed to yourself, and keep your soul diligently, lest you forget the things which your eyes saw, and lest they depart from your heart all the days of your life; but make them known to your children and your children's children;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> the day that you stood before Yahweh your God in Horeb, when Yahweh said to me, "Assemble me the people, and I will make them hear my words, that they may learn to fear me all the days that they live on the earth, and that they may teach their children."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> You came near and stood under the mountain; and the mountain burned with fire to the heart of the sky, with darkness, cloud, and thick darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Yahweh spoke to you out of the midst of the fire: you heard the voice of words, but you saw no form; only [you heard] a voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to perform, even the ten commandments; and he wrote them on two tables of stone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Yahweh commanded me at that time to teach you statutes and ordinances, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> Take therefore good heed to yourselves; for you saw no kind of form on the day that Yahweh spoke to you in Horeb out of the midst of the fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> Lest you corrupt yourselves, and make yourself an engraved image in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, the likeness of any winged bird that flies in the sky,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> the likeness of anything that creeps on the ground, the likeness of any fish that is in the water under the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> and lest you lift up your eyes to the sky, and when you see the sun and the moon and the stars, even all the army of the sky, you are drawn away and worship them, and serve them, which Yahweh your God has allotted to all the peoples under the whole sky.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> But Yahweh has taken you, and brought you forth out of the iron furnace, out of Egypt, to be to him a people of inheritance, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Furthermore Yahweh was angry with me for your sakes, and swore that I should not go over the Jordan, and that I should not go in to that good land, which Yahweh your God gives you for an inheritance:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> but I must die in this land, I must not go over the Jordan; but you shall go over, and possess that good land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> Take heed to yourselves, lest you forget the covenant of Yahweh your God, which he made with you, and make you an engraved image in the form of anything which Yahweh your God has forbidden you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> For Yahweh your God is a devouring fire, a jealous God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> When you shall father children, and children's children, and you shall have been long in the land, and shall corrupt yourselves, and make an engraved image in the form of anything, and shall do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh your God, to provoke him to anger;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that you shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto you go over the Jordan to possess it; you shall not prolong your days on it, but shall utterly be destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> Yahweh will scatter you among the peoples, and you shall be left few in number among the nations, where Yahweh shall lead you away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> There you shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> But from there you shall seek Yahweh your God, and you shall find him, when you search after him with all your heart and with all your soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> When you are in oppression, and all these things are come on you, in the latter days you shall return to Yahweh your God, and listen to his voice:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> for Yahweh your God is a merciful God; he will not fail you, neither destroy you, nor forget the covenant of your fathers which he swore to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:32">4:32</a> For ask now of the days that are past, which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and from the one end of the sky to the other, whether there has been [any such thing] as this great thing is, or has been heard like it?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:33">4:33</a> Did ever a people hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you have heard, and live?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:34">4:34</a> Or has God tried to go and take him a nation from the midst of [another] nation, by trials, by signs, and by wonders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by an outstretched arm, and by great terrors, according to all that Yahweh your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:35">4:35</a> It was shown to you so that you might know that Yahweh is God. There is no one else besides him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:36">4:36</a> Out of heaven he made you to hear his voice, that he might instruct you: and on earth he made you to see his great fire; and you heard his words out of the midst of the fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:37">4:37</a> Because he loved your fathers, therefore he chose their seed after them, and brought you out with his presence, with his great power, out of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:38">4:38</a> to drive out nations from before you greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land for an inheritance, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:39">4:39</a> Know therefore this day, and lay it to your heart, that Yahweh he is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath; there is none else.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:40">4:40</a> You shall keep his statutes, and his commandments, which I command you this day, that it may go well with you, and with your children after you, and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh your God gives you, forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:41">4:41</a> Then Moses set apart three cities beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:42">4:42</a> that the manslayer might flee there, who kills his neighbor unawares, and didn't hate him in time past; and that fleeing to one of these cities he might live:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:43">4:43</a> [namely], Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, for the Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, for the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan, for the Manassites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:44">4:44</a> This is the law which Moses set before the children of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:45">4:45</a> these are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which Moses spoke to the children of Israel, when they came forth out of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:46">4:46</a> beyond the Jordan, in the valley over against Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the children of Israel struck, when they came forth out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:47">4:47</a> They took his land in possession, and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:48">4:48</a> from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the Arnon, even to Mount Sion (the same is Hermon),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:49">4:49</a> and all the Arabah beyond the Jordan eastward, even to the sea of the Arabah, under the slopes of Pisgah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, Hear, Israel, the statutes and the ordinances which I speak in your ears this day, that you may learn them, and observe to do them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Yahweh our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> Yahweh didn't make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, even us, who are all of us here alive this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> Yahweh spoke with you face to face on the mountain out of the midst of the fire,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> (I stood between Yahweh and you at that time, to show you the word of Yahweh: for you were afraid because of the fire, and didn't go up onto the mountain;) saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> "I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> "You shall have no other gods before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> "You shall not make an engraved image for yourself, [nor] any likeness [of anything] that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is in the water under the earth:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> you shall not bow down yourself to them, nor serve them; for I, Yahweh, your God, am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, and on the third and on the fourth generation of those who hate me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> and showing loving kindness to thousands of those who love me and keep my commandments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> "You shall not take the name of Yahweh your God in vain: for Yahweh will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> "Observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, as Yahweh your God commanded you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> You shall labor six days, and do all your work;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God, in which you shall not do any work, you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your livestock, nor your stranger who is within your gates; that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> You shall remember that you were a servant in the land of Egypt, and Yahweh your God brought you out of there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm: therefore Yahweh your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> "Honor your father and your mother, as Yahweh your God commanded you; that your days may be long, and that it may go well with you, in the land which Yahweh your God gives you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> "You shall not murder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> "Neither shall you commit adultery.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> "Neither shall you steal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> "Neither shall you give false testimony against your neighbor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> "Neither shall you covet your neighbor's wife; neither shall you desire your neighbor's house, his field, or his male servant, or his female servant, his ox, or his donkey, or anything that is your neighbor's."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> These words Yahweh spoke to all your assembly on the mountain out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. He wrote them on two tables of stone, and gave them to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> It happened, when you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, that you came near to me, even all the heads of your tribes, and your elders;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> and you said, "Behold, Yahweh our God has shown us his glory and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God does speak with man, and he lives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> Now therefore why should we die? For this great fire will consume us: if we hear the voice of Yahweh our God any more, then we shall die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> Go near, and hear all that Yahweh our God shall say: and tell us all that Yahweh our God shall tell you; and we will hear it, and do it."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> Yahweh heard the voice of your words, when you spoke to me; and Yahweh said to me, "I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they have spoken to you: they have well said all that they have spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> Oh that there were such a heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their children forever!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> "Go tell them, Return to your tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> But as for you, stand here by me, and I will tell you all the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which you shall teach them, that they may do them in the land which I give them to possess it."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:32">5:32</a> You shall observe to do therefore as Yahweh your God has commanded you: you shall not turn aside to the right hand or to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:33">5:33</a> You shall walk in all the way which Yahweh your God has commanded you, that you may live, and that it may be well with you, and that you may prolong your days in the land which you shall possess.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Now this is the commandment, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh your God commanded to teach you, that you might do them in the land where you go over to possess it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> that you might fear Yahweh your God, to keep all his statutes and his commandments, which I command you, you, and your son, and your son's son, all the days of your life; and that your days may be prolonged.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Hear therefore, Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be well with you, and that you may increase mightily, as Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has promised to you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Hear, Israel: Yahweh is our God; Yahweh is one:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> and you shall love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> These words, which I command you this day, shall be on your heart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> You shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> It shall be, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land which he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give you, great and goodly cities, which you didn't build,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> and houses full of all good things, which you didn't fill, and cisterns dug out, which you didn't dig, vineyards and olive trees, which you didn't plant, and you shall eat and be full;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> then beware lest you forget Yahweh, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> You shall fear Yahweh your God; and you shall serve him, and shall swear by his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> You shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the peoples who are around you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> for Yahweh your God in the midst of you is a jealous God; lest the anger of Yahweh your God be kindled against you, and he destroy you from off the face of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> You shall not tempt Yahweh your God, as you tempted him in Massah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> You shall diligently keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he has commanded you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> You shall do that which is right and good in the sight of Yahweh; that it may be well with you, and that you may go in and possess the good land which Yahweh swore to your fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> to thrust out all your enemies from before you, as Yahweh has spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> When your son asks you in time to come, saying, "What do the testimonies, the statutes, and the ordinances, which Yahweh our God has commanded you mean?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> then you shall tell your son, "We were Pharaoh's bondservants in Egypt: and Yahweh brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> and Yahweh showed great and awesome signs and wonders on Egypt, on Pharaoh, and on all his house, before our eyes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> and he brought us out from there, that he might bring us in, to give us the land which he swore to our fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> Yahweh commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear Yahweh our God, for our good always, that he might preserve us alive, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> It shall be righteousness to us, if we observe to do all this commandment before Yahweh our God, as he has commanded us."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> When Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, and shall cast out many nations before you, the Hittite, and the Girgashite, and the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> and when Yahweh your God shall deliver them up before you, and you shall strike them; then you shall utterly destroy them: you shall make no covenant with them, nor show mercy to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> neither shall you make marriages with them; your daughter you shall not give to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> For he will turn away your son from following me, that they may serve other gods: so the anger of Yahweh would be kindled against you, and he would destroy you quickly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> But you shall deal with them like this: you shall break down their altars, and dash their pillars in pieces, and cut down their Asherim, and burn their engraved images with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> For you are a holy people to Yahweh your God: Yahweh your God has chosen you to be a people for his own possession, above all peoples who are on the face of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Yahweh didn't set his love on you, nor choose you, because you were more in number than any people; for you were the fewest of all peoples:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> but because Yahweh loves you, and because he would keep the oath which he swore to your fathers, has Yahweh brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of the house of bondage, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> Know therefore that Yahweh your God, he is God, the faithful God, who keeps covenant and loving kindness with them who love him and keep his commandments to a thousand generations,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> and repays those who hate him to their face, to destroy them: he will not be slack to him who hates him, he will repay him to his face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> You shall therefore keep the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I command you this day, to do them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> It shall happen, because you listen to these ordinances, and keep and do them, that Yahweh your God will keep with you the covenant and the loving kindness which he swore to your fathers:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> and he will love you, and bless you, and multiply you; he will also bless the fruit of your body and the fruit of your ground, your grain and your new wine and your oil, the increase of your livestock and the young of your flock, in the land which he swore to your fathers to give you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> You shall be blessed above all peoples: there shall not be male or female barren among you, or among your livestock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> Yahweh will take away from you all sickness; and none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which you know, he will put on you, but will lay them on all those who hate you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> You shall consume all the peoples whom Yahweh your God shall deliver to you; your eye shall not pity them: neither shall you serve their gods; for that will be a snare to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> If you shall say in your heart, "These nations are more than I; how can I dispossess them?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> you shall not be afraid of them: you shall well remember what Yahweh your God did to Pharaoh, and to all Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> the great trials which your eyes saw, and the signs, and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which Yahweh your God brought you out: so shall Yahweh your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> Moreover Yahweh your God will send the hornet among them, until those who are left, and hide themselves, perish from before you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> You shall not be scared of them; for Yahweh your God is in the midst of you, a great and awesome God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> Yahweh your God will cast out those nations before you by little and little: you may not consume them at once, lest the animals of the field increase on you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> But Yahweh your God will deliver them up before you, and will confuse them with a great confusion, until they be destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> He will deliver their kings into your hand, and you shall make their name to perish from under the sky: no man shall be able to stand before you, until you have destroyed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> You shall burn the engraved images of their gods with fire. You shall not covet the silver or the gold that is on them, nor take it for yourself, lest you be snared in it; for it is an abomination to Yahweh your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> You shall not bring an abomination into your house, and become a devoted thing like it. You shall utterly detest it, and you shall utterly abhor it; for it is a devoted thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> You shall observe to do all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may live, and multiply, and go in and possess the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> You shall remember all the way which Yahweh your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, to prove you, to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep his commandments, or not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> He humbled you, and allowed you to hunger, and fed you with manna, which you didn't know, neither did your fathers know; that he might make you know that man does not live by bread only, but by everything that proceeds out of the mouth of Yahweh does man live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> Your clothing didn't grow old on you, neither did your foot swell, these forty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> You shall consider in your heart that as a man chastens his son, so Yahweh your God chastens you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> You shall keep the commandments of Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> For Yahweh your God brings you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of springs, and underground water flowing into valleys and hills;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates; a land of olive trees and honey;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> a land in which you shall eat bread without scarceness, you shall not lack anything in it; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you may dig copper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> You shall eat and be full, and you shall bless Yahweh your God for the good land which he has given you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> Beware lest you forget Yahweh your God, in not keeping his commandments, and his ordinances, and his statutes, which I command you this day:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> lest, when you have eaten and are full, and have built goodly houses, and lived therein;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> and when your herds and your flocks multiply, and your silver and your gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> then your heart be lifted up, and you forget Yahweh your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> who led you through the great and terrible wilderness, [in which were] fiery serpents and scorpions, and thirsty ground where there was no water; who brought you forth water out of the rock of flint;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> who fed you in the wilderness with manna, which your fathers didn't know; that he might humble you, and that he might prove you, to do you good at your latter end:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> and [lest] you say in your heart, "My power and the might of my hand has gotten me this wealth."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> But you shall remember Yahweh your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth; that he may establish his covenant which he swore to your fathers, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> It shall be, if you shall forget Yahweh your God, and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I testify against you this day that you shall surely perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> As the nations that Yahweh makes to perish before you, so you shall perish; because you wouldn't listen to the voice of Yahweh your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Hear, Israel: you are to pass over the Jordan this day, to go in to dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourself, cities great and fortified up to the sky,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> a people great and tall, the sons of the Anakim, whom you know, and of whom you have heard say, "Who can stand before the sons of Anak?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> Know therefore this day, that Yahweh your God is he who goes over before you as a devouring fire; he will destroy them, and he will bring them down before you: so you shall drive them out, and make them to perish quickly, as Yahweh has spoken to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Don't say in your heart, after Yahweh your God has thrust them out from before you, saying, "For my righteousness Yahweh has brought me in to possess this land;" because Yahweh drives them out before you because of the wickedness of these nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> Not for your righteousness, or for the uprightness of your heart, do you go in to possess their land; but for the wickedness of these nations Yahweh your God does drive them out from before you, and that he may establish the word which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Know therefore, that Yahweh your God doesn't give you this good land to possess it for your righteousness; for you are a stiff-necked people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Remember, don't forget, how you provoked Yahweh your God to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that you went forth out of the land of Egypt, until you came to this place, you have been rebellious against Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> Also in Horeb you provoked Yahweh to wrath, and Yahweh was angry with you to destroy you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> When I was gone up onto the mountain to receive the tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant which Yahweh made with you, then I stayed on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> Yahweh delivered to me the two tables of stone written with the finger of God; and on them [was written] according to all the words, which Yahweh spoke with you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> It came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights, that Yahweh gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables of the covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> Yahweh said to me, "Arise, get down quickly from here; for your people whom you have brought forth out of Egypt have corrupted themselves; they have quickly turned aside out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a molten image."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> Furthermore Yahweh spoke to me, saying, "I have seen this people, and behold, it is a stiff-necked people:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name from under the sky; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> So I turned and came down from the mountain, and the mountain was burning with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> I looked, and behold, you had sinned against Yahweh your God; you had made yourselves a molten calf: you had turned aside quickly out of the way which Yahweh had commanded you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> I took hold of the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands, and broke them before your eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> I fell down before Yahweh, as at the first, forty days and forty nights; I did neither eat bread nor drink water; because of all your sin which you sinned, in doing that which was evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, with which Yahweh was angry against you to destroy you. But Yahweh listened to me that time also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Yahweh was very angry with Aaron to destroy him: and I prayed for Aaron also at the same time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> I took your sin, the calf which you had made, and burnt it with fire, and stamped it, grinding it very small, until it was as fine as dust: and I cast its dust into the brook that descended out of the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> At Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth Hattaavah, you provoked Yahweh to wrath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> When Yahweh sent you from Kadesh Barnea, saying, "Go up and possess the land which I have given you;" then you rebelled against the commandment of Yahweh your God, and you didn't believe him, nor listen to his voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> You have been rebellious against Yahweh from the day that I knew you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> So I fell down before Yahweh the forty days and forty nights that I fell down, because Yahweh had said he would destroy you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> I prayed to Yahweh, and said, "Lord Yahweh, don't destroy your people and your inheritance, that you have redeemed through your greatness, that you have brought forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; don't look to the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness, nor to their sin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> lest the land you brought us out from say, 'Because Yahweh was not able to bring them into the land which he promised to them, and because he hated them, he has brought them out to kill them in the wilderness.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> Yet they are your people and your inheritance, which you brought out by your great power and by your outstretched arm."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> At that time Yahweh said to me, "Cut two tables of stone like the first, and come up to me onto the mountain, and make an ark of wood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> I will write on the tables the words that were on the first tables which you broke, and you shall put them in the ark."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> So I made an ark of acacia wood, and cut two tables of stone like the first, and went up onto the mountain, having the two tables in my hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> He wrote on the tables, according to the first writing, the ten commandments, which Yahweh spoke to you on the mountain out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly: and Yahweh gave them to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> I turned and came down from the mountain, and put the tables in the ark which I had made; and there they are as Yahweh commanded me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> (The children of Israel traveled from Beeroth Bene Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died, and there he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> From there they traveled to Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> At that time Yahweh set apart the tribe of Levi, to bear the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, to stand before Yahweh to minister to him, and to bless in his name, to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> Therefore Levi has no portion nor inheritance with his brothers; Yahweh is his inheritance, according as Yahweh your God spoke to him.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> I stayed on the mountain, as at the first time, forty days and forty nights: and Yahweh listened to me that time also; Yahweh would not destroy you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> Yahweh said to me, "Arise, take your journey before the people; and they shall go in and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers to give to them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Now, Israel, what does Yahweh your God require of you, but to fear Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to love him, and to serve Yahweh your God with all your heart and with all your soul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> to keep the commandments of Yahweh, and his statutes, which I command you this day for your good?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> Behold, to Yahweh your God belongs heaven and the heaven of heavens, the earth, with all that is therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Only Yahweh had a delight in your fathers to love them, and he chose their seed after them, even you above all peoples, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no more stiff-necked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> For Yahweh your God, he is God of gods, and Lord of lords, the great God, the mighty, and the awesome, who doesn't respect persons, nor takes reward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> He does execute justice for the fatherless and widow, and loves the foreigner, in giving him food and clothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> Therefore love the foreigner; for you were foreigners in the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> You shall fear Yahweh your God; you shall serve him; and you shall cling to him, and you shall swear by his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> He is your praise, and he is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things, which your eyes have seen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> Your fathers went down into Egypt with seventy persons; and now Yahweh your God has made you as the stars of the sky for multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Therefore you shall love Yahweh your God, and keep his instructions, and his statutes, and his ordinances, and his commandments, always.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Know this day: for I don't speak with your children who have not known, and who have not seen the chastisement of Yahweh your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his outstretched arm,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> and his signs, and his works, which he did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and to all his land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> and what he did to the army of Egypt, to their horses, and to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red Sea to overflow them as they pursued after you, and how Yahweh has destroyed them to this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> and what he did to you in the wilderness, until you came to this place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> and what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben; how the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> but your eyes have seen all the great work of Yahweh which he did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> Therefore you shall keep all the commandment which I command you this day, that you may be strong, and go in and possess the land, where you go over to possess it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> and that you may prolong your days in the land, which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give to them and to their seed, a land flowing with milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> For the land, where you go in to possess it, isn't as the land of Egypt, that you came out from, where you sowed your seed, and watered it with your foot, as a garden of herbs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> but the land, where you go over to possess it, is a land of hills and valleys, [and] drinks water of the rain of the sky,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> a land which Yahweh your God cares for: the eyes of Yahweh your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year even to the end of the year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> It shall happen, if you shall listen diligently to my commandments which I command you this day, to love Yahweh your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all your soul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> that I will give the rain of your land in its season, the former rain and the latter rain, that you may gather in your grain, and your new wine, and your oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> I will give grass in your fields for your livestock, and you shall eat and be full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> Take heed to yourselves, lest your heart be deceived, and you turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> and the anger of Yahweh be kindled against you, and he shut up the sky, so that there shall be no rain, and the land shall not yield its fruit; and you perish quickly from off the good land which Yahweh gives you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> Therefore you shall lay up these my words in your heart and in your soul; and you shall bind them for a sign on your hand, and they shall be for symbols between your eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> You shall teach them your children, talking of them, when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> You shall write them on the door posts of your house, and on your gates;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> that your days may be multiplied, and the days of your children, in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers to give them, as the days of the heavens above the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> For if you shall diligently keep all this commandment which I command you, to do it, to love Yahweh your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> then will Yahweh drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than yourselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> Every place whereon the sole of your foot shall tread shall be yours: from the wilderness, and Lebanon, from the river, the river Euphrates, even to the hinder sea shall be your border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> No man shall be able to stand before you: Yahweh your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you on all the land that you shall tread on, as he has spoken to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> the blessing, if you shall listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, which I command you this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> and the curse, if you shall not listen to the commandments of Yahweh your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you this day, to go after other gods, which you have not known.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> It shall happen, when Yahweh your God shall bring you into the land where you go to possess it, that you shall set the blessing on Mount Gerizim, and the curse on Mount Ebal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> Aren't they beyond the Jordan, behind the way of the going down of the sun, in the land of the Canaanites who dwell in the Arabah, over against Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:31">11:31</a> For you are to pass over the Jordan to go in to possess the land which Yahweh your God gives you, and you shall possess it, and dwell therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:32">11:32</a> You shall observe to do all the statutes and the ordinances which I set before you this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> These are the statutes and the ordinances which you shall observe to do in the land which Yahweh, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess it, all the days that you live on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> You shall surely destroy all the places in which the nations that you shall dispossess served their gods, on the high mountains, and on the hills, and under every green tree:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> and you shall break down their altars, and dash in pieces their pillars, and burn their Asherim with fire; and you shall cut down the engraved images of their gods; and you shall destroy their name out of that place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> You shall not do so to Yahweh your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> But to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose out of all your tribes, to put his name there, even to his habitation you shall seek, and there you shall come;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> and there you shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> and there you shall eat before Yahweh your God, and you shall rejoice in all that you put your hand to, you and your households, in which Yahweh your God has blessed you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> You shall not do after all the things that we do here this day, every man whatever is right in his own eyes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> for you haven't yet come to the rest and to the inheritance, which Yahweh your God gives you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> But when you go over the Jordan, and dwell in the land which Yahweh your God causes you to inherit, and he gives you rest from all your enemies around you, so that you dwell in safety;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> then it shall happen that to the place which Yahweh your God shall choose, to cause his name to dwell there, there you shall bring all that I command you: your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the wave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which you vow to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> You shall rejoice before Yahweh your God, you, and your sons, and your daughters, and your male servants, and your female servants, and the Levite who is within your gates, because he has no portion nor inheritance with you.</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> Even as the gazelle and as the hart is eaten, so you shall eat of it: the unclean and the clean may eat of it alike.</p>

 <p><a name="an_28:68">28:68</a> Yahweh will bring you into Egypt again with ships, by the way of which I said to you, You shall see it no more again: and there you shall sell yourselves to your enemies for bondservants and for bondmaids, and no man shall buy you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:1">29:1</a> These are the words of the covenant which Yahweh commanded Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab, besides the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:2">29:2</a> Moses called to all Israel, and said to them, You have seen all that Yahweh did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:3">29:3</a> the great trials which your eyes saw, the signs, and those great wonders:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> but Yahweh has not given you a heart to know, and eyes to see, and ears to hear, to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes have not grown old on you, and your shoes have not grown old on your feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> You have not eaten bread, neither have you drunk wine or strong drink; that you may know that I am Yahweh your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> When you came to this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us to battle, and we struck them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> and we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half-tribe of the Manassites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that you may prosper in all that you do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> You stand this day all of you before Yahweh your God; your heads, your tribes, your elders, and your officers, even all the men of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:11">29:11</a> your little ones, your wives, and your foreigner who is in the midst of your camps, from the one who cuts your wood to the one who draws your water;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> that you may enter into the covenant of Yahweh your God, and into his oath, which Yahweh your God makes with you this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> that he may establish you this day to himself for a people, and that he may be to you a God, as he spoke to you, and as he swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> but with him who stands here with us this day before Yahweh our God, and also with him who is not here with us this day</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> (for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we came through the midst of the nations through which you passed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> and you have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which were among them);</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or tribe, whose heart turns away this day from Yahweh our God, to go to serve the gods of those nations; lest there should be among you a root that bears gall and wormwood;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> and it happen, when he hears the words of this curse, that he bless himself in his heart, saying, "I shall have peace, though I walk in the stubbornness of my heart, to destroy the moist with the dry."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> Yahweh will not pardon him, but then the anger of Yahweh and his jealousy will smoke against that man, and all the curse that is written in this book shall lie on him, and Yahweh will blot out his name from under the sky.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> Yahweh will set him apart to evil out of all the tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant that is written in this book of the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> The generation to come, your children who shall rise up after you, and the foreigner who shall come from a far land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and the sicknesses with which Yahweh has made it sick;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> [and that] the whole land of it is sulfur, and salt, [and] a burning, [that] it is not sown, nor bears, nor any grass grows therein, like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which Yahweh overthrew in his anger, and in his wrath:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> even all the nations shall say, "Why has Yahweh done thus to this land? What does the heat of this great anger mean?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> Then men shall say, "Because they forsook the covenant of Yahweh, the God of their fathers, which he made with them when he brought them forth out of the land of Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> and went and served other gods, and worshiped them, gods that they didn't know, and that he had not given to them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> therefore the anger of Yahweh was kindled against this land, to bring on it all the curse that is written in this book;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:28">29:28</a> and Yahweh rooted them out of their land in anger, and in wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as at this day."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:29">29:29</a> The secret things belong to Yahweh our God; but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> It shall happen, when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you shall call them to mind among all the nations, where Yahweh your God has driven you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> and shall return to Yahweh your God, and shall obey his voice according to all that I command you this day, you and your children, with all your heart, and with all your soul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> that then Yahweh your God will turn your captivity, and have compassion on you, and will return and gather you from all the peoples, where Yahweh your God has scattered you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> If [any of] your outcasts are in the uttermost parts of the heavens, from there will Yahweh your God gather you, and from there he will bring you back:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> and Yahweh your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you shall possess it; and he will do you good, and multiply you above your fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> Yahweh your God will circumcise your heart, and the heart of your seed, to love Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, that you may live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> Yahweh your God will put all these curses on your enemies, and on those who hate you, who persecuted you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> You shall return and obey the voice of Yahweh, and do all his commandments which I command you this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> Yahweh your God will make you plenteous in all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your body, and in the fruit of your livestock, and in the fruit of your ground, for good: for Yahweh will again rejoice over you for good, as he rejoiced over your fathers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> if you shall obey the voice of Yahweh your God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in this book of the law; if you turn to Yahweh your God with all your heart, and with all your soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> For this commandment which I command you this day, it is not too hard for you, neither is it far off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> It is not in heaven, that you should say, "Who shall go up for us to heaven, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, "Who shall go over the sea for us, and bring it to us, and make us to hear it, that we may do it?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> But the word is very near to you, in your mouth, and in your heart, that you may do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> Behold, I have set before you this day life and good, and death and evil;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> in that I command you this day to love Yahweh your God, to walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his ordinances, that you may live and multiply, and that Yahweh your God may bless you in the land where you go in to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> But if your heart turns away, and you will not hear, but shall be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> I denounce to you this day, that you shall surely perish; you shall not prolong your days in the land, where you pass over the Jordan to go in to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse: therefore choose life, that you may live, you and your seed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> to love Yahweh your God, to obey his voice, and to cling to him; for he is your life, and the length of your days; that you may dwell in the land which Yahweh swore to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> He said to them, "I am one hundred twenty years old this day; I can no more go out and come in: and Yahweh has said to me, 'You shall not go over this Jordan.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> Yahweh your God, he will go over before you; he will destroy these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess them: [and] Joshua, he shall go over before you, as Yahweh has spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> Yahweh will do to them as he did to Sihon and to Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land; whom he destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> Yahweh will deliver them up before you, and you shall do to them according to all the commandment which I have commanded you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> Be strong and courageous, don't be afraid, nor be scared of them: for Yahweh your God, he it is who does go with you; he will not fail you, nor forsake you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> Moses called to Joshua, and said to him in the sight of all Israel, "Be strong and courageous: for you shall go with this people into the land which Yahweh has sworn to their fathers to give them; and you shall cause them to inherit it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> Yahweh, he it is who does go before you; he will be with you, he will not fail you, neither forsake you: don't be afraid, neither be dismayed."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and to all the elders of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> Moses commanded them, saying, "At the end of [every] seven years, in the set time of the year of release, in the feast of tents,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> when all Israel is come to appear before Yahweh your God in the place which he shall choose, you shall read this law before all Israel in their hearing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> Assemble the people, the men and the women and the little ones, and your foreigner who is within your gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and fear Yahweh your God, and observe to do all the words of this law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> and that their children, who have not known, may hear, and learn to fear Yahweh your God, as long as you live in the land where you go over the Jordan to possess it."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, your days approach that you must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the Tent of Meeting, that I may commission him." Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the Tent of Meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> Yahweh appeared in the Tent in a pillar of cloud: and the pillar of cloud stood over the door of the Tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Behold, you shall sleep with your fathers; and this people will rise up, and play the prostitute after the strange gods of the land, where they go to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall come on them; so that they will say in that day, 'Haven't these evils come on us because our God is not among us?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evil which they shall have worked, in that they are turned to other gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> "Now therefore write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me against the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> For when I shall have brought them into the land which I swore to their fathers, flowing with milk and honey, and they shall have eaten and filled themselves, and grown fat; then will they turn to other gods, and serve them, and despise me, and break my covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> It shall happen, when many evils and troubles are come on them, that this song shall testify before them as a witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I know their imagination which they frame this day, before I have brought them into the land which I swore."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> He commissioned Joshua the son of Nun, and said, "Be strong and courageous; for you shall bring the children of Israel into the land which I swore to them: and I will be with you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> It happened, when Moses had made an end of writing the words of this law in a book, until they were finished,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> that Moses commanded the Levites, who bore the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> "Take this book of the law, and put it by the side of the ark of the covenant of Yahweh your God, that it may be there for a witness against you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> For I know your rebellion, and your stiff neck: behold, while I am yet alive with you this day, you have been rebellious against Yahweh; and how much more after my death?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> Assemble to me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth to witness against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> For I know that after my death you will utterly corrupt yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will happen to you in the latter days; because you will do that which is evil in the sight of Yahweh, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> Moses spoke in the ears of all the assembly of Israel the words of this song, until they were finished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> Give ear, you heavens, and I will speak. Let the earth hear the words of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> My doctrine shall drop as the rain. My speech shall condense as the dew, as the small rain on the tender grass, as the showers on the herb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> For I will proclaim the name of Yahweh. Ascribe greatness to our God!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> The Rock, his work is perfect, for all his ways are justice: a God of faithfulness and without iniquity, just and right is he.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> They have dealt corruptly with him, [they are] not his children, [it is] their blemish. [They are] a perverse and crooked generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> Do you thus requite Yahweh, foolish people and unwise? Isn't he your father who has bought you? He has made you, and established you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> Remember the days of old. Consider the years of many generations. Ask your father, and he will show you; your elders, and they will tell you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he separated the children of men, he set the bounds of the peoples according to the number of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> For Yahweh's portion is his people. Jacob is the lot of his inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> He found him in a desert land, in the waste howling wilderness. He surrounded him. He cared for him. He kept him as the apple of his eye.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> As an eagle that stirs up her nest, that flutters over her young, he spread abroad his wings, he took them, he bore them on his feathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> Yahweh alone led him. There was no foreign god with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> He made him ride on the high places of the earth. He ate the increase of the field. He caused him to suck honey out of the rock, oil out of the flinty rock;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> Butter of the herd, and milk of the flock, with fat of lambs, rams of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the finest of the wheat. Of the blood of the grape you drank wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> But Jeshurun grew fat, and kicked. You have grown fat. You have grown thick. You have become sleek. Then he forsook God who made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> They moved him to jealousy with strange [gods]. They provoked him to anger with abominations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> They sacrificed to demons, [which were] no God, to gods that they didn't know, to new [gods] that came up of late, which your fathers didn't dread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> Of the Rock who became your father, you are unmindful, and have forgotten God who gave you birth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> Yahweh saw [it], and abhorred [them], because of the provocation of his sons and his daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> He said, "I will hide my face from them. I will see what their end shall be; for they are a very perverse generation, children in whom is no faithfulness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God. They have provoked me to anger with their vanities. I will move them to jealousy with those who are not a people. I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> For a fire is kindled in my anger, Burns to the lowest Sheol, Devours the earth with its increase, and sets the foundations of the mountains on fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> "I will heap evils on them. I will spend my arrows on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> [They shall be] wasted with hunger, and devoured with burning heat and bitter destruction. I will send the teeth of animals on them, With the poison of crawling things of the dust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> Outside the sword shall bereave, and in the rooms, terror; on both young man and virgin, The nursing infant with the gray-haired man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> I said, I would scatter them afar. I would make the memory of them to cease from among men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> were it not that I feared the provocation of the enemy, lest their adversaries should judge wrongly, lest they should say, 'Our hand is exalted, Yahweh has not done all this.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> For they are a nation void of counsel. There is no understanding in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would consider their latter end!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> How could one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, and Yahweh had delivered them up?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves being judges.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, of the fields of Gomorrah. Their grapes are grapes of gall, Their clusters are bitter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> Their wine is the poison of serpents, The cruel venom of asps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> "Isn't this laid up in store with me, sealed up among my treasures?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> Vengeance is mine, and recompense, at the time when their foot slides; for the day of their calamity is at hand. The things that are to come on them shall make haste."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:36">32:36</a> For Yahweh will judge his people, and have compassion on his servants, when he sees that [their] power is gone, There is none [remaining], shut up or left at large.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:37">32:37</a> He will say, "Where are their gods, The rock in which they took refuge;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:38">32:38</a> Which ate the fat of their sacrifices, And drank the wine of their drink offering? Let them rise up and help you! Let them be your protection.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:39">32:39</a> "See now that I, even I, am he, There is no god with me. I kill, and I make alive. I wound, and I heal. There is no one who can deliver out of my hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:40">32:40</a> For I lift up my hand to heaven, And say, As I live forever,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:41">32:41</a> if I whet my glittering sword, My hand take hold on judgment; I will render vengeance to my adversaries, and will recompense those who hate me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:42">32:42</a> I will make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword shall devour flesh with the blood of the slain and the captives, from the head of the leaders of the enemy."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:43">32:43</a> Rejoice, you nations, [with] his people, for he will avenge the blood of his servants. He will render vengeance to his adversaries, And will make expiation for his land, for his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:44">32:44</a> Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the ears of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:45">32:45</a> Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:46">32:46</a> He said to them, "Set your heart to all the words which I testify to you this day, which you shall command your children to observe to do, [even] all the words of this law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:47">32:47</a> For it is no vain thing for you; because it is your life, and through this thing you shall prolong your days in the land, where you go over the Jordan to possess it."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:48">32:48</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses that same day, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:49">32:49</a> "Go up into this mountain of Abarim, to Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and see the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel for a possession;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:50">32:50</a> and die on the mountain where you go up, and be gathered to your people, as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor, and was gathered to his people:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:51">32:51</a> because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel at the waters of Meribah of Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because you didn't sanctify me in the midst of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:52">32:52</a> For you shall see the land before you; but you shall not go there into the land which I give the children of Israel."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> This is the blessing, with which Moses the man of God blessed the children of Israel before his death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> He said, "Yahweh came from Sinai, And rose from Seir to them. He shone forth from Mount Paran. He came from the ten thousands of holy ones. At his right hand was a fiery law for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> Yes, he loves the people. All his saints are in your hand. They sat down at your feet; [Everyone] shall receive of your words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> Moses commanded us a law, An inheritance for the assembly of Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> He was king in Jeshurun, When the heads of the people were gathered, All the tribes of Israel together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> "Let Reuben live, and not die; Nor let his men be few."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> This is [the blessing] of Judah: and he said, "Hear, Yahweh, the voice of Judah. Bring him in to his people. With his hands he contended for himself. You shall be a help against his adversaries."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> Of Levi he said, "Your Thummim and your Urim are with your godly one, whom you proved at Massah, with whom you strove at the waters of Meribah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> who said of his father, and of his mother, 'I have not seen him;' Neither did he acknowledge his brothers, Nor did he know his own children: For they have observed your word, and keep your covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> They shall teach Jacob your ordinances, and Israel your law. They shall put incense before you, and whole burnt offering on your altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> Yahweh, bless his substance. Accept the work of his hands. Strike through the hips of those who rise up against him, of those who hate him, that they not rise again."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> Of Benjamin he said, "The beloved of Yahweh shall dwell in safety by him. He covers him all the day long. He dwells between his shoulders."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> Of Joseph he said, "His land is blessed by Yahweh, for the precious things of the heavens, for the dew, for the deep that couches beneath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> for the precious things of the fruits of the sun, for the precious things of the growth of the moons,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> for the chief things of the ancient mountains, for the precious things of the everlasting hills,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> for the precious things of the earth and its fullness, the good will of him who lived in the bush. Let [the blessing] come on the head of Joseph, On the crown of the head of him who was separate from his brothers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> The firstborn of his herd, majesty is his. His horns are the horns of the wild ox. With them he shall push the peoples all of them, [even] the ends of the earth: They are the ten thousands of Ephraim. They are the thousands of Manasseh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> Of Zebulun he said, "Rejoice, Zebulun, in your going out; and Issachar, in your tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> They shall call the peoples to the mountain. There they will offer sacrifices of righteousness, for they shall draw out the abundance of the seas, the hidden treasures of the sand."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> Of Gad he said, "He who enlarges Gad is blessed. He dwells as a lioness, and tears the arm, yes, the crown of the head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> He provided the first part for himself, for there was the lawgiver's portion reserved. He came [with] the heads of the people. He executed the righteousness of Yahweh, His ordinances with Israel."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> Of Dan he said, "Dan is a lion's cub that leaps out of Bashan."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> Of Naphtali he said, "Naphtali, satisfied with favor, full of the blessing of Yahweh, Possess the west and the south."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:24">33:24</a> Of Asher he said, "Asher is blessed with children. Let him be acceptable to his brothers. Let him dip his foot in oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:25">33:25</a> Your bars shall be iron and brass. As your days, so your strength will be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:26">33:26</a> "There is none like God, Jeshurun, who rides on the heavens for your help, In his excellency on the skies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:27">33:27</a> The eternal God is [your] dwelling place. Underneath are the everlasting arms. He thrust out the enemy from before you, and said, 'Destroy!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:28">33:28</a> Israel dwells in safety; the fountain of Jacob alone, In a land of grain and new wine. Yes, his heavens drop down dew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:29">33:29</a> You are happy, Israel. Who is like you, a people saved by Yahweh, the shield of your help, the sword of your excellency! Your enemies shall submit themselves to you. You shall tread on their high places."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. Yahweh showed him all the land of Gilead, to Dan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, to the hinder sea,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> and the South, and the Plain of the valley of Jericho the city of palm trees, to Zoar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> Yahweh said to him, "This is the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, 'I will give it to your seed.' I have caused you to see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> So Moses the servant of Yahweh died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab over against Beth Peor: but no man knows of his tomb to this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> Moses was one hundred twenty years old when he died: his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> The children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping in the mourning for Moses were ended.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for Moses had laid his hands on him: and the children of Israel listened to him, and did as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> There has not arisen a prophet since in Israel like Moses, whom Yahweh knew face to face,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> in all the signs and the wonders, which Yahweh sent him to do in the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his land,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> and in all the mighty hand, and in all the great terror, which Moses worked in the sight of all Israel.</p>
