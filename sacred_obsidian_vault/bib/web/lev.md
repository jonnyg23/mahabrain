 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Yahweh called to Moses, and spoke to him out of the Tent of Meeting, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When anyone of you offers an offering to Yahweh, you shall offer your offering of the livestock, from the herd and from the flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> "'If his offering is a burnt offering from the herd, he shall offer a male without blemish. He shall offer it at the door of the Tent of Meeting, that he may be accepted before Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> He shall lay his hand on the head of the burnt offering, and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> He shall kill the bull before Yahweh. Aaron's sons, the priests, shall present the blood and sprinkle the blood around on the altar that is at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> He shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> The sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire on the altar, and lay wood in order on the fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> and Aaron's sons, the priests, shall lay the pieces, the head, and the fat in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> but its innards and its legs he shall wash with water. The priest shall burn the whole on the altar, for a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> "'If his offering is from the flock, from the sheep, or from the goats, for a burnt offering, he shall offer a male without blemish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before Yahweh. Aaron's sons, the priests, shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> He shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat. The priest shall lay them in order on the wood that is on the fire which is on the altar,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> but the innards and the legs he shall wash with water. The priest shall offer the whole, and burn it on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> "'If his offering to Yahweh is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall offer his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and burn it on the altar; and its blood shall be drained out on the side of the altar;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and he shall take away its crop with its filth, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, in the place of the ashes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> He shall tear it by its wings, but shall not divide it apart. The priest shall burn it on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> "'When anyone offers an offering of a meal offering to Yahweh, his offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil on it, and put frankincense on it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> He shall bring it to Aaron's sons, the priests; and he shall take his handful of its fine flour, and of its oil, with all its frankincense; and the priest shall burn its memorial on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'. It is a most holy thing of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> "'When you offer an offering of a meal offering baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> If your offering is a meal offering of the griddle, it shall be of unleavened fine flour, mixed with oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> You shall cut it in pieces, and pour oil on it. It is a meal offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> If your offering is a meal offering of the pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> You shall bring the meal offering that is made of these things to Yahweh: and it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> The priest shall take from the meal offering its memorial, and shall burn it on the altar, an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> That which is left of the meal offering shall be Aaron's and his sons'. It is a thing most holy of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> "'No meal offering, which you shall offer to Yahweh, shall be made with yeast; for you shall burn no yeast, nor any honey, as an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> As an offering of firstfruits you shall offer them to Yahweh: but they shall not ascend for a pleasant aroma on the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Every offering of your meal offering you shall season with salt; neither shall you allow the salt of the covenant of your God to be lacking from your meal offering. With all your offerings you shall offer salt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> "'If you offer a meal offering of first fruits to Yahweh, you shall offer for the meal offering of your first fruits grain in the ear parched with fire, bruised grain of the fresh ear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> You shall put oil on it, and lay frankincense on it: it is a meal offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> The priest shall burn as its memorial, part of its bruised grain, and part of its oil, along with all its frankincense: it is an offering made by fire to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> "'If his offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings; if he offers it from the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it at the door of the Tent of Meeting: and Aaron's sons, the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> He shall offer of the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; the fat that covers the innards, and all the fat that is on the innards,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar on the burnt offering, which is on the wood that is on the fire: it is an offering made by fire, of a pleasant aroma to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> "'If his offering for a sacrifice of peace offerings to Yahweh is from the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> If he offers a lamb for his offering, then he shall offer it before Yahweh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering, and kill it before the Tent of Meeting: and Aaron's sons shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> He shall offer from the sacrifice of peace offerings an offering made by fire to Yahweh; its fat, the entire tail fat, he shall take away close to the backbone; and the fat that covers the inwards, and all the fat that is on the inwards,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by the loins, and the cover on the liver, with the kidneys, he shall take away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> The priest shall burn it on the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> "'If his offering is a goat, then he shall offer it before Yahweh:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> and he shall lay his hand on its head, and kill it before the Tent of Meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar.</p>

 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> "Speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'If anyone sins unintentionally, in any of the things which Yahweh has commanded not to be done, and does any one of them:</p>

 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, "Boil the flesh at the door of the Tent of Meeting, and there eat it and the bread that is in the basket of consecration, as I commanded, saying, 'Aaron and his sons shall eat it.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_8:36">8:36</a> Aaron and his sons did all the things which Yahweh commanded by Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> It happened on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron and his sons, and the elders of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> and he said to Aaron, "Take a calf from the herd for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer them before Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> You shall speak to the children of Israel, saying, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, both a year old, without blemish, for a burnt offering;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> and a bull and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before Yahweh; and a meal offering mixed with oil: for today Yahweh appears to you.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> They brought what Moses commanded before the Tent of Meeting: and all the congregation drew near and stood before Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Moses said, "This is the thing which Yahweh commanded that you should do: and the glory of Yahweh shall appear to you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Moses said to Aaron, "Draw near to the altar, and offer your sin offering, and your burnt offering, and make atonement for yourself, and for the people; and offer the offering of the people, and make atonement for them; as Yahweh commanded."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> So Aaron drew near to the altar, and killed the calf of the sin offering, which was for himself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the base of the altar:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> but the fat, and the kidneys, and the cover from the liver of the sin offering, he burned upon the altar; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> The flesh and the skin he burned with fire outside the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> He killed the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons delivered the blood to him, and he sprinkled it around on the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> They delivered the burnt offering to him, piece by piece, and the head: and he burned them upon the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> He washed the innards and the legs, and burned them on the burnt offering on the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> He presented the people's offering, and took the goat of the sin offering which was for the people, and killed it, and offered it for sin, like the first.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> He presented the burnt offering, and offered it according to the ordinance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> He presented the meal offering, and filled his hand from there, and burned it upon the altar, besides the burnt offering of the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons delivered to him the blood, which he sprinkled around on the altar,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> and the fat of the bull and of the ram, the fat tail, and that which covers the innards, and the kidneys, and the cover of the liver:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> and they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burned the fat on the altar:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> and the breasts and the right thigh Aaron waved for a wave offering before Yahweh, as Moses commanded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> Aaron lifted up his hands toward the people, and blessed them; and he came down from offering the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace offerings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> There came forth fire from before Yahweh, and consumed the burnt offering and the fat upon the altar: and when all the people saw it, they shouted, and fell on their faces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, each took his censer, and put fire in it, and laid incense on it, and offered strange fire before Yahweh, which he had not commanded them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> And fire came forth from before Yahweh, and devoured them, and they died before Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what Yahweh spoke of, saying, 'I will show myself holy to those who come near me, and before all the people I will be glorified.'" Aaron held his peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said to them, "Draw near, carry your brothers from before the sanctuary out of the camp."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> So they drew near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp, as Moses had said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> Moses said to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons, "Don't let the hair of your heads go loose, neither tear your clothes; that you don't die, and that he not be angry with all the congregation: but let your brothers, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which Yahweh has kindled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> You shall not go out from the door of the Tent of Meeting, lest you die; for the anointing oil of Yahweh is on you." They did according to the word of Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> Yahweh spoke to Aaron, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> "Drink no wine nor strong drink, you, nor your sons with you, when you go into the Tent of Meeting, that you don't die: it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> and that you are to make a distinction between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> and that you are to teach the children of Israel all the statutes which Yahweh has spoken to them by Moses."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Moses spoke to Aaron, and to Eleazar and to Ithamar, his sons who were left, "Take the meal offering that remains of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire, and eat it without yeast beside the altar; for it is most holy;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> and you shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion, and your sons' portion, of the offerings of Yahweh made by fire: for so I am commanded.</p>

 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Moses diligently inquired about the goat of the sin offering, and, behold, it was burned: and he was angry with Eleazar and with Ithamar, the sons of Aaron who were left, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> "Why haven't you eaten the sin offering in the place of the sanctuary, since it is most holy, and he has given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before Yahweh?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> Behold, its blood was not brought into the inner part of the sanctuary: you certainly should have eaten it in the sanctuary, as I commanded."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> Aaron spoke to Moses, "Behold, this day they have offered their sin offering and their burnt offering before Yahweh; and such things as these have happened to me: and if I had eaten the sin offering today, would it have been pleasing in the sight of Yahweh?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> When Moses heard that, it was pleasing in his sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying to them,</p>
