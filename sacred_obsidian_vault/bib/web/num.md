 <p><a name="an_7:89">7:89</a> When Moses went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with Yahweh, he heard his voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat that was on the ark of the Testimony, from between the two cherubim: and he spoke to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> "Speak to Aaron, and tell him, 'When you light the lamps, the seven lamps shall give light in front of the lampstand.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> Aaron did so. He lit its lamps to light the area in front of the lampstand, as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> This was the workmanship of the lampstand, beaten work of gold. From its base to its flowers, it was beaten work: according to the pattern which Yahweh had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> "Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and cleanse them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> You shall do this to them, to cleanse them: sprinkle the water of cleansing on them, let them shave their whole bodies with a razor, and let them wash their clothes, and cleanse themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> Then let them take a young bull, and its meal offering, fine flour mixed with oil; and another young bull you shall take for a sin offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting. You shall assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> You shall present the Levites before Yahweh. The children of Israel shall lay their hands on the Levites,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> and Aaron shall offer the Levites before Yahweh for a wave offering, on the behalf of the children of Israel, that it may be theirs to do the service of Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> "The Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, and you shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering to Yahweh, to make atonement for the Levites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> You shall set the Levites before Aaron, and before his sons, and offer them as a wave offering to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the children of Israel, and the Levites shall be mine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> "After that, the Levites shall go in to do the service of the Tent of Meeting: and you shall cleanse them, and offer them as a wave offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> For they are wholly given to me from among the children of Israel; instead of all who open the womb, even the firstborn of all the children of Israel, I have taken them to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> For all the firstborn among the children of Israel are mine, both man and animal. On the day that I struck all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified them for myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> I have taken the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of the children of Israel in the Tent of Meeting, and to make atonement for the children of Israel; that there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the children of Israel come near to the sanctuary."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children of Israel did so to the Levites. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the children of Israel did to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> The Levites purified themselves from sin, and they washed their clothes; and Aaron offered them for a wave offering before Yahweh; and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> After that, the Levites went in to do their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron, and before his sons: as Yahweh had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> "This is that which belongs to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall go in to wait on the service in the work of the Tent of Meeting;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> and from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting on the work, and shall serve no more,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> but shall minister with their brothers in the Tent of Meeting, to perform the duty, and shall do no service. You shall do thus to the Levites concerning their duties."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> "Moreover let the children of Israel keep the Passover in its appointed season.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> On the fourteenth day of this month, at evening, you shall keep it in its appointed season--according to all its statutes, and according to all its ordinances, you shall keep it."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Moses spoke to the children of Israel, that they should keep the Passover.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> They kept the Passover in the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month, at evening, in the wilderness of Sinai. According to all that Yahweh commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> There were certain men, who were unclean because of the dead body of a man, so that they could not keep the Passover on that day, and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Those men said to him, "We are unclean because of the dead body of a man. Why are we kept back, that we may not offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season among the children of Israel?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> Moses answered them, "Wait, that I may hear what Yahweh will command concerning you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> "Say to the children of Israel, 'If any man of you or of your generations is unclean by reason of a dead body, or is on a journey far away, he shall still keep the Passover to Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> In the second month, on the fourteenth day at evening they shall keep it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> They shall leave none of it until the morning, nor break a bone of it. According to all the statute of the Passover they shall keep it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> But the man who is clean, and is not on a journey, and fails to keep the Passover, that soul shall be cut off from his people. Because he didn't offer the offering of Yahweh in its appointed season, that man shall bear his sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> "'If a foreigner lives among you, and desires to keep the Passover to Yahweh; according to the statute of the Passover, and according to its ordinance, so shall he do. You shall have one statute, both for the foreigner, and for him who is born in the land.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> On the day that the tabernacle was raised up, the cloud covered the tabernacle, even the Tent of the Testimony: and at evening it was over the tabernacle as it were the appearance of fire, until morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> So it was continually. The cloud covered it, and the appearance of fire by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> Whenever the cloud was taken up from over the Tent, then after that the children of Israel traveled; and in the place where the cloud remained, there the children of Israel encamped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> At the commandment of Yahweh, the children of Israel traveled, and at the commandment of Yahweh they encamped. As long as the cloud remained on the tabernacle they remained encamped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> When the cloud stayed on the tabernacle many days, then the children of Israel kept Yahweh's command, and didn't travel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Sometimes the cloud was a few days on the tabernacle; then according to the commandment of Yahweh they remained encamped, and according to the commandment of Yahweh they traveled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> Sometimes the cloud was from evening until morning; and when the cloud was taken up in the morning, they traveled: or by day and by night, when the cloud was taken up, they traveled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> Whether it was two days, or a month, or a year that the cloud stayed on the tabernacle, remaining on it, the children of Israel remained encamped, and didn't travel; but when it was taken up, they traveled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> At the commandment of Yahweh they encamped, and at the commandment of Yahweh they traveled. They kept Yahweh's command, at the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> "Make two trumpets of silver. You shall make them of beaten work. You shall use them for the calling of the congregation, and for the journeying of the camps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> When they blow them, all the congregation shall gather themselves to you at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> If they blow just one, then the princes, the heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> When you blow an alarm, the camps that lie on the east side shall go forward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> When you blow an alarm the second time, the camps that lie on the south side shall go forward. They shall blow an alarm for their journeys.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> But when the assembly is to be gathered together, you shall blow, but you shall not sound an alarm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> "The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets. This shall be to you for a statute forever throughout your generations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> When you go to war in your land against the adversary who oppresses you, then you shall sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before Yahweh your God, and you will be saved from your enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> "Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your months, you shall blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; and they shall be to you for a memorial before your God. I am Yahweh your God."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> It happened in the second year, in the second month, on the twentieth day of the month, that the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle of the testimony.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> The children of Israel went forward according to their journeys out of the wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud stayed in the wilderness of Paran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> They first went forward according to the commandment of Yahweh by Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> First, the standard of the camp of the children of Judah went forward according to their armies. Nahshon the son of Amminadab was over his army.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Nethanel the son of Zuar was over the army of the tribe of the children of Issachar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Eliab the son of Helon was over the army of the tribe of the children of Zebulun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> The tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who bore the tabernacle, went forward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> The standard of the camp of Reuben went forward according to their armies. Elizur the son of Shedeur was over his army.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was over the army of the tribe of the children of Simeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> Eliasaph the son of Deuel was over the army of the tribe of the children of Gad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> The Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary. The others set up the tabernacle before they arrived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> The standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set forward according to their armies. Elishama the son of Ammihud was over his army.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was over the army of the tribe of the children of Manasseh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> Abidan the son of Gideoni was over the army of the tribe of the children of Benjamin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> The standard of the camp of the children of Dan, which was the rear guard of all the camps, set forward according to their armies. Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai was over his army.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> Pagiel the son of Ochran was over the army of the tribe of the children of Asher.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> Ahira the son of Enan was over the army of the tribe of the children of Naphtali.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> Thus were the travels of the children of Israel according to their armies; and they went forward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> Moses said to Hobab, the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses' father-in-law, "We are journeying to the place of which Yahweh said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us, and we will treat you well; for Yahweh has spoken good concerning Israel."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:30">10:30</a> He said to him, "I will not go; but I will depart to my own land, and to my relatives."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:31">10:31</a> He said, "Don't leave us, please; because you know how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and you can be our eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:32">10:32</a> It shall be, if you go with us, yes, it shall be, that whatever good Yahweh does to us, we will do the same to you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:33">10:33</a> They set forward from the Mount of Yahweh three days' journey. The ark of the covenant of Yahweh went before them three days' journey, to seek out a resting place for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:34">10:34</a> The cloud of Yahweh was over them by day, when they set forward from the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:35">10:35</a> It happened, when the ark went forward, that Moses said, "Rise up, Yahweh, and let your enemies be scattered! Let those who hate you flee before you!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:36">10:36</a> When it rested, he said, "Return, Yahweh, to the ten thousands of the thousands of Israel."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> The people were complaining in the ears of Yahweh. When Yahweh heard it, his anger was kindled; and Yahweh's fire burnt among them, and consumed some of the outskirts of the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> The people cried to Moses; and Moses prayed to Yahweh, and the fire abated.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> The name of that place was called Taberah, because Yahweh's fire burnt among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> The mixed multitude that was among them lusted exceedingly: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, "Who will give us flesh to eat?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> We remember the fish, which we ate in Egypt for nothing; the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> but now we have lost our appetite. There is nothing at all except this manna to look at."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> The manna was like coriander seed, and its appearance like the appearance of bdellium.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> The people went around, gathered it, and ground it in mills, or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes of it. Its taste was like the taste of fresh oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> When the dew fell on the camp in the night, the manna fell on it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man at the door of his tent; and the anger of Yahweh was kindled greatly; and Moses was displeased.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> Moses said to Yahweh, "Why have you treated with your servant so badly? Why haven't I found favor in your sight, that you lay the burden of all this people on me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> Have I conceived all this people? Have I brought them forth, that you should tell me, 'Carry them in your bosom, as a nurse carries a nursing infant, to the land which you swore to their fathers?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> Where could I get meat to give to all this people? For they weep to me, saying, 'Give us meat, that we may eat.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> If you treat me this way, please kill me right now, if I have found favor in your sight; and don't let me see my wretchedness."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom you know to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the Tent of Meeting, that they may stand there with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> I will come down and talk with you there. I will take of the Spirit which is on you, and will put it on them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, that you not bear it yourself alone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> "Say to the people, 'Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow, and you will eat flesh; for you have wept in the ears of Yahweh, saying, "Who will give us flesh to eat? For it was well with us in Egypt." Therefore Yahweh will give you flesh, and you will eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> You will not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> but a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it is loathsome to you; because that you have rejected Yahweh who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, "Why did we come out of Egypt?"'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> Moses said, "The people, among whom I am, are six hundred thousand men on foot; and you have said, 'I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> Shall flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to be sufficient for them?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Has Yahweh's hand grown short? Now you will see whether my word will happen to you or not."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> Moses went out, and told the people the words of Yahweh; and he gathered seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the Tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> Yahweh came down in the cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the Spirit that was on him, and put it on the seventy elders: and it happened that when the Spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but they did so no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> But two men remained in the camp. The name of one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the Spirit rested on them; and they were of those who were written, but had not gone out to the Tent; and they prophesied in the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> A young man ran, and told Moses, and said, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his chosen men, answered, "My lord Moses, forbid them!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> Moses said to him, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all Yahweh's people were prophets, that Yahweh would put his Spirit on them!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> Moses went into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:31">11:31</a> A wind from Yahweh went out and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, about a day's journey on this side, and a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and about two cubits above the surface of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:32">11:32</a> The people rose up all that day, and all the night, and all the next day, and gathered the quails. He who gathered least gathered ten homers; and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:33">11:33</a> While the flesh was yet between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of Yahweh was kindled against the people, and Yahweh struck the people with a very great plague.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:34">11:34</a> The name of that place was called Kibroth Hattaavah, because there they buried the people who lusted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:35">11:35</a> From Kibroth Hattaavah the people traveled to Hazeroth; and they stayed at Hazeroth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married; for he had married a Cushite woman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> They said, "Has Yahweh indeed spoken only with Moses? Hasn't he spoken also with us?" And Yahweh heard it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> Now the man Moses was very humble, above all the men who were on the surface of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> Yahweh spoke suddenly to Moses, to Aaron, and to Miriam, "You three come out to the Tent of Meeting!" The three of them came out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Yahweh came down in a pillar of cloud, and stood at the door of the Tent, and called Aaron and Miriam; and they both came forward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> He said, "Hear now my words. If there is a prophet among you, I Yahweh will make myself known to him in a vision. I will speak with him in a dream.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> My servant Moses is not so. He is faithful in all my house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> With him I will speak mouth to mouth, even plainly, and not in riddles; and he shall see Yahweh's form. Why then were you not afraid to speak against my servant, against Moses?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> The anger of Yahweh was kindled against them; and he departed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> The cloud departed from over the Tent; and behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. Aaron looked at Miriam, and behold, she was leprous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> Aaron said to Moses, "Oh, my lord, please don't count this sin against us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> Let her not, I pray, be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when he comes out of his mother's womb."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> Moses cried to Yahweh, saying, "Heal her, God, I beg you!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "If her father had but spit in her face, shouldn't she be ashamed seven days? Let her be shut up outside of the camp seven days, and after that she shall be brought in again."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> Miriam was shut up outside of the camp seven days, and the people didn't travel until Miriam was brought in again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> Afterward the people traveled from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> "Send men, that they may spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel. Of every tribe of their fathers, you shall send a man, every one a prince among them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> Moses sent them from the wilderness of Paran according to the commandment of Yahweh: all of them men who were heads of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> These were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Nun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> Of the tribe of Joseph, [namely], of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> These are the names of the men who Moses sent to spy out the land. Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun Joshua.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, "Go up this way by the South, and go up into the hill country:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> and see the land, what it is; and the people who dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, whether they are few or many;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> and what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in camps, or in strongholds;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> and what the land is, whether it is fat or lean, whether there is wood therein, or not. Be courageous, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> So they went up, and spied out the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, to the entrance of Hamath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> They went up by the South, and came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> They came to the valley of Eshcol, and cut down from there a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it on a staff between two; [they brought] also of the pomegranates, and of the figs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> That place was called the valley of Eshcol, because of the cluster which the children of Israel cut down from there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> They returned from spying out the land at the end of forty days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> They went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> They told him, and said, "We came to the land where you sent us; and surely it flows with milk and honey; and this is its fruit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> However the people who dwell in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified, [and] very great: and moreover we saw the children of Anak there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> Amalek dwells in the land of the South: and the Hittite, and the Jebusite, and the Amorite, dwell in the hill country; and the Canaanite dwells by the sea, and along by the side of the Jordan."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, "Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> But the men who went up with him said, "We aren't able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:32">13:32</a> They brought up an evil report of the land which they had spied out to the children of Israel, saying, "The land, through which we have gone to spy it out, is a land that eats up its inhabitants; and all the people who we saw in it are men of great stature.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> There we saw the Nephilim, the sons of Anak, who come of the Nephilim: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> All the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> All the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, "Would that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would that we had died in this wilderness!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> Why does Yahweh bring us to this land, to fall by the sword? Our wives and our little ones will be a prey: wouldn't it be better for us to return into Egypt?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> They said one to another, "Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of those who spied out the land, tore their clothes:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> and they spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, "The land, which we passed through to spy it out, is an exceeding good land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> If Yahweh delights in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which flows with milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> Only don't rebel against Yahweh, neither fear the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is removed from over them, and Yahweh is with us. Don't fear them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> But all the congregation threatened to stone them with stones. The glory of Yahweh appeared in the Tent of Meeting to all the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "How long will this people despise me? and how long will they not believe in me, for all the signs which I have worked among them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> I will strike them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> Moses said to Yahweh, "Then the Egyptians will hear it; for you brought up this people in your might from among them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that you Yahweh are in the midst of this people; for you Yahweh are seen face to face, and your cloud stands over them, and you go before them, in a pillar of cloud by day, and in a pillar of fire by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> Now if you killed this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of you will speak, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> 'Because Yahweh was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he has slain them in the wilderness.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> Now please let the power of the Lord be great, according as you have spoken, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> 'Yahweh is slow to anger, and abundant in loving kindness, forgiving iniquity and disobedience; and that will by no means clear [the guilty], visiting the iniquity of the fathers on the children, on the third and on the fourth generation.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> Please pardon the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of your loving kindness, and according as you have forgiven this people, from Egypt even until now."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> Yahweh said, "I have pardoned according to your word:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> but in very deed, as I live, and as all the earth shall be filled with the glory of Yahweh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> because all those men who have seen my glory, and my signs, which I worked in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have tempted me these ten times, and have not listened to my voice;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of those who despised me see it:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> but my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and has followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite dwell in the valley: tomorrow turn, and go into the wilderness by the way to the Red Sea."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> "How long [shall I bear] with this evil congregation, that murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> Tell them, 'As I live, says Yahweh, surely as you have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:29">14:29</a> your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness; and all who were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:30">14:30</a> surely you shall not come into the land, concerning which I swore that I would make you dwell therein, except Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:31">14:31</a> But your little ones, that you said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which you have rejected.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:32">14:32</a> But as for you, your dead bodies shall fall in this wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:33">14:33</a> Your children shall be wanderers in the wilderness forty years, and shall bear your prostitution, until your dead bodies be consumed in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:34">14:34</a> After the number of the days in which you spied out the land, even forty days, for every day a year, you will bear your iniquities, even forty years, and you will know my alienation.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:35">14:35</a> I, Yahweh, have spoken, surely this will I do to all this evil congregation, who are gathered together against me: in this wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:36">14:36</a> The men, whom Moses sent to spy out the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up an evil report against the land,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:37">14:37</a> even those men who did bring up an evil report of the land, died by the plague before Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:38">14:38</a> But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, remained alive of those men who went to spy out the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:39">14:39</a> Moses told these words to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:40">14:40</a> They rose up early in the morning, and went up to the top of the mountain, saying, "Behold, we are here, and will go up to the place which Yahweh has promised: for we have sinned."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:41">14:41</a> Moses said, "Why now do you disobey the commandment of Yahweh, since it shall not prosper?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:42">14:42</a> Don't go up, for Yahweh isn't among you; that you not be struck down before your enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:43">14:43</a> For there the Amalekite and the Canaanite are before you, and you shall fall by the sword: because you are turned back from following Yahweh, therefore Yahweh will not be with you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:44">14:44</a> But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of Yahweh, and Moses, didn't depart out of the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:45">14:45</a> Then the Amalekite came down, and the Canaanite who lived in that mountain, and struck them and beat them down, even to Hormah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> "Speak to the children of Israel, and tell them, 'When you have come into the land of your habitations, which I give to you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> and will make an offering by fire to Yahweh, a burnt offering, or a sacrifice, to accomplish a vow, or as a freewill offering, or in your set feasts, to make a pleasant aroma to Yahweh, of the herd, or of the flock;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> then he who offers his offering shall offer to Yahweh a meal offering of a tenth part [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with the fourth part of a hin of oil:</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:33">15:33</a> Those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:34">15:34</a> They put him in custody, because it had not been declared what should be done to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:35">15:35</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside of the camp."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:36">15:36</a> All the congregation brought him outside of the camp, and stoned him to death with stones; as Yahweh commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:37">15:37</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took [men]:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> and they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred fifty princes of the congregation, called to the assembly, men of renown;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, "You take too much on yourself, since all the congregation are holy, everyone of them, and Yahweh is among them: why then lift yourselves up above the assembly of Yahweh?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> When Moses heard it, he fell on his face:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> and he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, "In the morning Yahweh will show who are his, and who is holy, and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he shall choose he will cause to come near to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> Do this: take censers, Korah, and all his company;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> and put fire in them, and put incense on them before Yahweh tomorrow: and it shall be that the man whom Yahweh chooses, he shall be holy. You have gone too far, you sons of Levi!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> Moses said to Korah, "Hear now, you sons of Levi!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> Is it a small thing to you, that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of Yahweh, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them;</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against Yahweh: and Aaron, what is he that you murmur against him?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; and they said, "We won't come up:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, but you must also make yourself a prince over us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> Moreover you haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: will you put out the eyes of these men? We won't come up."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> Moses was very angry, and said to Yahweh, "Don't respect their offering: I have not taken one donkey from them, neither have I hurt one of them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> Moses said to Korah, "You and all your company go before Yahweh, you, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> and each man take his censer, and put incense on them, and each man bring before Yahweh his censer, two hundred fifty censers; you also, and Aaron, each his censer."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> They each took his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense thereon, and stood at the door of the Tent of Meeting with Moses and Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> Korah assembled all the congregation against them to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to all the congregation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> They fell on their faces, and said, "God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and will you be angry with all the congregation?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> "Speak to the congregation, saying, 'Get away from around the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram!'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> Moses rose up and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> He spoke to the congregation, saying, "Depart, please, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest you be consumed in all their sins!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> So they went away from the tent of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood at the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> Moses said, "Hereby you shall know that Yahweh has sent me to do all these works; for [I have] not [done them] of my own mind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then Yahweh hasn't sent me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> But if Yahweh make a new thing, and the ground open its mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down alive into Sheol; then you shall understand that these men have despised Yahweh."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> It happened, as he made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground split apart that was under them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> and the earth opened its mouth, and swallowed them up, and their households, and all the men who appertained to Korah, and all their goods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> So they, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into Sheol: and the earth closed on them, and they perished from among the assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> All Israel that were around them fled at the cry of them; for they said, "Lest the earth swallow us up!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> Fire came forth from Yahweh, and devoured the two hundred fifty men who offered the incense.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:37">16:37</a> "Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter the fire yonder; for they are holy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:38">16:38</a> even the censers of these sinners against their own lives; and let them be made beaten plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before Yahweh; therefore they are holy; and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:39">16:39</a> Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers, which those who were burnt had offered; and they beat them out for a covering of the altar,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:40">16:40</a> to be a memorial to the children of Israel, to the end that no stranger, who isn't of the seed of Aaron, comes near to burn incense before Yahweh; that he not be as Korah, and as his company: as Yahweh spoke to him by Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:41">16:41</a> But on the next day all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, "You have killed Yahweh's people!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:42">16:42</a> It happened, when the congregation was assembled against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the Tent of Meeting: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of Yahweh appeared.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:43">16:43</a> Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:44">16:44</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:45">16:45</a> "Get away from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment!" They fell on their faces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:46">16:46</a> Moses said to Aaron, "Take your censer, and put fire from off the altar in it, and lay incense on it, and carry it quickly to the congregation, and make atonement for them; for wrath has gone out from Yahweh! The plague has begun."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:47">16:47</a> Aaron did as Moses said, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague has begun among the people: and he put on the incense, and made atonement for the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:48">16:48</a> He stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:49">16:49</a> Now those who died by the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides those who died about the matter of Korah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:50">16:50</a> Aaron returned to Moses to the door of the Tent of Meeting: and the plague was stayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> "Speak to the children of Israel, and take of them rods, one for each fathers' house, of all their princes according to their fathers' houses, twelve rods: write every man's name on his rod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> You shall write Aaron's name on the rod of Levi; for there shall be one rod for each head of their fathers' houses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> You shall lay them up in the Tent of Meeting before the testimony, where I meet with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> It shall happen, that the rod of the man whom I shall choose shall bud: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> Moses spoke to the children of Israel; and all their princes gave him rods, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> Moses laid up the rods before Yahweh in the tent of the testimony.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> It happened on the next day, that Moses went into the tent of the testimony; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi was budded, and put forth buds, and produced blossoms, and bore ripe almonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> Moses brought out all the rods from before Yahweh to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Put back the rod of Aaron before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the children of rebellion; that you may make an end of their murmurings against me, that they not die."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> Moses did so. As Yahweh commanded him, so he did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> The children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, "Behold, we perish! We are undone! We are all undone!</p>

 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> It shall be a perpetual statute to them: and he who sprinkles the water for impurity shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> "Whatever the unclean person touches shall be unclean; and the soul that touches it shall be unclean until evening."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> The children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came into the wilderness of Zin in the first month: and the people stayed in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> There was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> The people strove with Moses, and spoke, saying, "We wish that we had died when our brothers died before Yahweh!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> Why have you brought the assembly of Yahweh into this wilderness, that we should die there, we and our animals?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> Why have you made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us in to this evil place? It is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the Tent of Meeting, and fell on their faces: and the glory of Yahweh appeared to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> "Take the rod, and assemble the congregation, you, and Aaron your brother, and speak to the rock before their eyes, that it give forth its water; and you shall bring forth to them water out of the rock; so you shall give the congregation and their livestock drink."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> Moses took the rod from before Yahweh, as he commanded him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly together before the rock, and he said to them, "Hear now, you rebels; shall we bring you water out of this rock for you?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> Moses lifted up his hand, and struck the rock with his rod twice: and water came forth abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their livestock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> Yahweh said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you didn't believe in me, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore you shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> These are the waters of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with Yahweh, and he was sanctified in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, saying: "Thus says your brother Israel: You know all the travail that has happened to us:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> how our fathers went down into Egypt, and we lived in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians dealt ill with us, and our fathers:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> and when we cried to Yahweh, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and brought us forth out of Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of your border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> "Please let us pass through your land: we will not pass through field or through vineyard, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go along the king's highway; we will not turn aside to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed your border."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> Edom said to him, "You shall not pass through me, lest I come out with the sword against you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> The children of Israel said to him, "We will go up by the highway; and if we drink of your water, I and my livestock, then will I give its price: let me only, without [doing] anything [else], pass through on my feet."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> He said, "You shall not pass through." Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border, so Israel turned away from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> They traveled from Kadesh: and the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron in Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> "Aaron shall be gathered to his people; for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you rebelled against my word at the waters of Meribah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to Mount Hor;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> and strip Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered [to his people], and shall die there."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> Moses did as Yahweh commanded: and they went up into Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them on Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mountain: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> When all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they wept for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> The Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the South, heard tell that Israel came by the way of Atharim; and he fought against Israel, and took some of them captive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> Israel vowed a vow to Yahweh, and said, "If you will indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> Yahweh listened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and the name of the place was called Hormah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> They traveled from Mount Hor by the way to the Red Sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> The people spoke against God, and against Moses, "Why have you brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, and there is no water; and our soul loathes this light bread."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> Yahweh sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> The people came to Moses, and said, "We have sinned, because we have spoken against Yahweh, and against you. Pray to Yahweh, that he take away the serpents from us." Moses prayed for the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Make a fiery serpent, and set it on a standard: and it shall happen, that everyone who is bitten, when he sees it, shall live."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> Moses made a serpent of brass, and set it on the standard: and it happened, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the serpent of brass, he lived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in Oboth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> They traveled from Oboth, and encamped at Iyeabarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> From there they traveled, and encamped in the valley of Zered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> From there they traveled, and encamped on the other side of the Arnon, which is in the wilderness, that comes out of the border of the Amorites: for the Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> Therefore it is said in the book of the Wars of Yahweh, "Vaheb in Suphah, the valleys of the Arnon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> the slope of the valleys that incline toward the dwelling of Ar, leans on the border of Moab."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> From there they traveled to Beer: that is the well of which Yahweh said to Moses, "Gather the people together, and I will give them water."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> Then sang Israel this song: "Spring up, well; sing to it:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> the well, which the princes dug, which the nobles of the people dug, with the scepter, and with their poles." From the wilderness [they traveled] to Mattanah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> and from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looks down on the desert.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> "Let me pass through your land: we will not turn aside into field, or into vineyard; we will not drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's highway, until we have passed your border."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz; and he fought against Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> Israel struck him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon; for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> Israel took all these cities: and Israel lived in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its towns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to the Arnon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> Therefore those who speak in proverbs say, "Come to Heshbon. Let the city of Sihon be built and established;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> for a fire has gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon. It has devoured Ar of Moab, The lords of the high places of the Arnon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> Woe to you, Moab! You are undone, people of Chemosh! He has given his sons as fugitives, and his daughters into captivity, to Sihon king of the Amorites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> We have shot at them. Heshbon has perished even to Dibon. We have laid waste even to Nophah, Which reaches to Medeba."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:31">21:31</a> Thus Israel lived in the land of the Amorites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:32">21:32</a> Moses sent to spy out Jazer; and they took its towns, and drove out the Amorites who were there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:33">21:33</a> They turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:34">21:34</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Don't fear him: for I have delivered him into your hand, and all his people, and his land; and you shall do to him as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:35">21:35</a> So they struck him, and his sons and all his people, until there was none left him remaining: and they possessed his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> The children of Israel traveled, and encamped in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan at Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> Moab was very afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> Moab said to the elders of Midian, "Now this multitude will lick up all that is around us, as the ox licks up the grass of the field." Balak the son of Zippor was king of Moab at that time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> He sent messengers to Balaam the son of Beor, to Pethor, which is by the River, to the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, "Behold, there is a people who came out from Egypt. Behold, they cover the surface of the earth, and they are staying opposite me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> Please come now therefore curse me this people; for they are too mighty for me: perhaps I shall prevail, that we may strike them, and that I may drive them out of the land; for I know that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> The elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> He said to them, "Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as Yahweh shall speak to me." The princes of Moab stayed with Balaam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> God came to Balaam, and said, "Who are these men with you?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> Balaam said to God, "Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent to me, [saying],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> 'Behold, the people that is come out of Egypt, it covers the surface of the earth: now, come curse me them; perhaps I shall be able to fight against them, and shall drive them out.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> God said to Balaam, "You shall not go with them. You shall not curse the people; for they are blessed."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> Balaam rose up in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, "Go to your land; for Yahweh refuses to permit me to go with you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> The princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, "Balaam refuses to come with us."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> They came to Balaam, and said to him, "Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, 'Please let nothing hinder you from coming to me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> for I will promote you to very great honor, and whatever you say to me I will do. Please come therefore, and curse this people for me.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> Balaam answered the servants of Balak, "If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I can't go beyond the word of Yahweh my God, to do less or more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> Now therefore, please wait also here this night, that I may know what Yahweh will speak to me more."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, "If the men have come to call you, rise up, go with them; but only the word which I speak to you, that you shall do."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his donkey, and went with the princes of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> God's anger was kindled because he went; and the angel of Yahweh placed himself in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and the donkey turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam struck the donkey, to turn her into the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> Then the angel of Yahweh stood in a narrow path between the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she thrust herself to the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he struck her again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> The angel of Yahweh went further, and stood in a narrow place, where there was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> The donkey saw the angel of Yahweh, and she lay down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he struck the donkey with his staff.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> Yahweh opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, "What have I done to you, that you have struck me these three times?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> Balaam said to the donkey, "Because you have mocked me, I wish there were a sword in my hand, for now I would have killed you."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> The donkey said to Balaam, "Am I not your donkey, on which you have ridden all your life long to this day? Was I ever in the habit of doing so to you?" He said, "No."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> Then Yahweh opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of Yahweh standing in the way, with his sword drawn in his hand; and he bowed his head, and fell on his face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:32">22:32</a> The angel of Yahweh said to him, "Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come forth as an adversary, because your way is perverse before me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:33">22:33</a> and the donkey saw me, and turned aside before me these three times. Unless she had turned aside from me, surely now I would have killed you, and saved her alive."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:34">22:34</a> Balaam said to the angel of Yahweh, "I have sinned; for I didn't know that you stood in the way against me. Now therefore, if it displeases you, I will go back again."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:35">22:35</a> The angel of Yahweh said to Balaam, "Go with the men; but only the word that I shall speak to you, that you shall speak." So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:36">22:36</a> When Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to the City of Moab, which is on the border of the Arnon, which is in the utmost part of the border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:37">22:37</a> Balak said to Balaam, "Didn't I earnestly send to you to call you? Why didn't you come to me? Am I not able indeed to promote you to honor?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:38">22:38</a> Balaam said to Balak, "Behold, I have come to you: have I now any power at all to speak anything? The word that God puts in my mouth, that shall I speak."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:39">22:39</a> Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath Huzoth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:40">22:40</a> Balak sacrificed cattle and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the princes who were with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:41">22:41</a> It happened in the morning, that Balak took Balaam, and brought him up into the high places of Baal; and he saw from there the utmost part of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> Balaam said to Balak, "Build me here seven altars, and prepare me here seven bulls and seven rams."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam offered on every altar a bull and a ram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> Balaam said to Balak, "Stand by your burnt offering, and I will go: perhaps Yahweh will come to meet me; and whatever he shows me I will tell you." He went to a bare height.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> God met Balaam: and he said to him, "I have prepared the seven altars, and I have offered up a bull and a ram on every altar."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> Yahweh put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and thus you shall speak."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> He returned to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, he, and all the princes of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> He took up his parable, and said, "From Aram has Balak brought me, the king of Moab from the mountains of the East. Come, curse Jacob for me. Come, defy Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> How shall I curse whom God has not cursed? How shall I defy whom Yahweh has not defied?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> For from the top of the rocks I see him. From the hills I see him. Behold, it is a people that dwells alone, and shall not be reckoned among the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> Who can count the dust of Jacob, or number the fourth part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous! Let my last end be like his!"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> Balak said to Balaam, "What have you done to me? I took you to curse my enemies, and behold, you have blessed them altogether."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> He answered and said, "Must I not take heed to speak that which Yahweh puts in my mouth?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> Balak said to him, "Please come with me to another place, where you may see them; you shall see but the utmost part of them, and shall not see them all: and curse me them from there."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> He took him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered up a bull and a ram on every altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> He said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offering, while I meet [Yahweh] yonder."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> Yahweh met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, "Return to Balak, and say this."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> He came to him, and behold, he was standing by his burnt offering, and the princes of Moab with him. Balak said to him, "What has Yahweh spoken?"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> He took up his parable, and said, "Rise up, Balak, and hear! Listen to me, you son of Zippor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> God is not a man, that he should lie, nor the son of man, that he should repent. Has he said, and will he not do it? Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> Behold, I have received a command to bless. He has blessed, and I can't reverse it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> He has not seen iniquity in Jacob. Neither has he seen perverseness in Israel. Yahweh his God is with him. The shout of a king is among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:22">23:22</a> God brings them out of Egypt. He has as it were the strength of the wild ox.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> Surely there is no enchantment with Jacob; Neither is there any divination with Israel. Now it shall be said of Jacob and of Israel, What has God done!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> Behold, the people rises up as a lioness, As a lion he lifts himself up. He shall not lie down until he eat of the prey, and drinks the blood of the slain."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> Balak said to Balaam, "Neither curse them at all, nor bless them at all."</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> When Balaam saw that it pleased Yahweh to bless Israel, he didn't go, as at the other times, to meet with enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel dwelling according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came on him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says;</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, "I called you to curse my enemies, and, behold, you have altogether blessed them these three times.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> Therefore now flee you to your place! I thought to promote you to great honor; but, behold, Yahweh has kept you back from honor."</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> He took up his parable, and said, "Balaam the son of Beor says, the man whose eye was closed says;</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> He looked at Amalek, and took up his parable, and said, "Amalek was the first of the nations, But his latter end shall come to destruction."</p>

 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak also went his way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> Israel stayed in Shittim; and the people began to play the prostitute with the daughters of Moab:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> for they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods; and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> Israel joined himself to Baal Peor: and the anger of Yahweh was kindled against Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> Yahweh said to Moses, "Take all the chiefs of the people, and hang them up to Yahweh before the sun, that the fierce anger of Yahweh may turn away from Israel."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> Moses said to the judges of Israel, "Everyone kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal Peor."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> Behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brothers a Midianite woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, while they were weeping at the door of the Tent of Meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> When Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose up from the midst of the congregation, and took a spear in his hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> and he went after the man of Israel into the pavilion, and thrust both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her body. So the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> Those who died by the plague were twenty-four thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> Yahweh spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> "Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, in that he was jealous with my jealousy among them, so that I didn't consume the children of Israel in my jealousy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> Therefore say, 'Behold, I give to him my covenant of peace:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> and it shall be to him, and to his seed after him, the covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was jealous for his God, and made atonement for the children of Israel.'"</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> Now the name of the man of Israel that was slain, who was slain with the Midianite woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a fathers' house among the Simeonites.</p>

 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> It happened after the plague, that Yahweh spoke to Moses and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> Yahweh's anger was kindled in that day, and he swore, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, and Joshua the son of Nun; because they have followed Yahweh completely.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> Yahweh's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander back and forth in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation, who had done evil in the sight of Yahweh, was consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> "Behold, you have risen up in your fathers' place, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of Yahweh toward Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> For if you turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and you will destroy all this people."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> They came near to him, and said, "We will build sheepfolds here for our livestock, and cities for our little ones:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> but we ourselves will be ready armed to go before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> For we will not inherit with them on the other side of the Jordan, and forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side of the Jordan eastward."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> Moses said to them, "If you will do this thing, if you will arm yourselves to go before Yahweh to the war,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> and every armed man of you will pass over the Jordan before Yahweh, until he has driven out his enemies from before him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> and the land is subdued before Yahweh; then afterward you shall return, and be guiltless towards Yahweh, and towards Israel; and this land shall be to you for a possession before Yahweh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> "But if you will not do so, behold, you have sinned against Yahweh; and be sure your sin will find you out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> Build cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which has proceeded out of your mouth."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> The children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, "Your servants will do as my lord commands.</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> So Moses commanded concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the heads of the fathers' [houses] of the tribes of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> Moses said to them, "If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over the Jordan, every man who is armed to battle, before Yahweh, and the land shall be subdued before you; then you shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> but if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan."</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> The children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, "As Yahweh has said to your servants, so will we do.</p>
