 <p align="center"><a href="../apo/ma1002.htm">Apo</a></p><p>1 In those days arose Mattathias the son of John, the son of Simeon, a priest of the sons of Joarib, from Jerusalem, and dwelt in Modin. </p>
 <p>2 And he had five sons, Joannan, called Caddis: </p>
 <p>3 Simon; called Thassi: </p>
 <p>4 Judas, who was called Maccabeus: </p>
 <p>5 Eleazar, called Avaran: and Jonathan, whose surname was Apphus. </p>
 <p>6 And when he saw the blasphemies that were committed in Juda and Jerusalem, </p>
 <p>7 He said, Woe is me! wherefore was I born to see this misery of my people, and of the holy city, and to dwell there, when it was delivered into the hand of the enemy, and the sanctuary into the hand of strangers? </p>
 <p>8 Her temple is become as a man without glory. </p>
 <p>9 Her glorious vessels are carried away into captivity, her infants are slain in the streets, her young men with the sword of the enemy. </p>
 <p>10 What nation hath not had a part in her kingdom and gotten of her spoils? </p>
 <p>11 All her ornaments are taken away; of a free woman she is become a bondslave. </p>
 <p>12 And, behold, our sanctuary, even our beauty and our glory, is laid waste, and the Gentiles have profaned it. </p>
 <p>13 To what end therefore shall we live any longer? </p>
 <p>14 Then Mattathias and his sons rent their clothes, and put on sackcloth, and mourned very sore. </p>
 <p>15 In the mean while the king's officers, such as compelled the people to revolt, came into the city Modin, to make them sacrifice. </p>
 <p>16 And when many of Israel came unto them, Mattathias also and his sons came together. </p>
 <p>17 Then answered the king's officers, and said to Mattathias on this wise, Thou art a ruler, and an honourable and great man in this city, and strengthened with sons and brethren: </p>
 <p>18 Now therefore come thou first, and fulfil the king's commandment, like as all the heathen have done, yea, and the men of Juda also, and such as remain at Jerusalem: so shalt thou and thy house be in the number of the king's friends, and thou and thy children shall be honoured with silver and gold, and many rewards. </p>
 <p>19 Then Mattathias answered and spake with a loud voice, Though all the nations that are under the king's dominion obey him, and fall away every one from the religion of their fathers, and give consent to his commandments: </p>
 <p>20 Yet will I and my sons and my brethren walk in the covenant of our fathers. </p>
 <p>21 God forbid that we should forsake the law and the ordinances. </p>
 <p>22 We will not hearken to the king's words, to go from our religion, either on the right hand, or the left. </p>
 <p>23 Now when he had left speaking these words, there came one of the Jews in the sight of all to sacrifice on the altar which was at Modin, according to the king's commandment. </p>
 <p>24 Which thing when Mattathias saw, he was inflamed with zeal, and his reins trembled, neither could he forbear to shew his anger according to judgment: wherefore he ran, and slew him upon the altar. </p>
 <p>25 Also the king's commissioner, who compelled men to sacrifice, he killed at that time, and the altar he pulled down. </p>
 <p>26 Thus dealt he zealously for the law of God like as Phinees did unto Zambri the son of Salom. </p>
 <p>27 And Mattathias cried throughout the city with a loud voice, saying, Whosoever is zealous of the law, and maintaineth the covenant, let him follow me. </p>
 <p>28 So he and his sons fled into the mountains, and left all that ever they had in the city. </p>
 <p>29 Then many that sought after justice and judgment went down into the wilderness, to dwell there: </p>
 <p>30 Both they, and their children, and their wives; and their cattle; because afflictions increased sore upon them. </p>
 <p>31 Now when it was told the king's servants, and the host that was at Jerusalem, in the city of David, that certain men, who had broken the king's commandment, were gone down into the secret places in the wilderness, </p>
 <p>32 They pursued after them a great number, and having overtaken them, they camped against them, and made war against them on the sabbath day. </p>
 <p>33 And they said unto them, Let that which ye have done hitherto suffice; come forth, and do according to the commandment of the king, and ye shall live. </p>
 <p>34 But they said, We will not come forth, neither will we do the king's commandment, to profane the sabbath day. </p>
 <p>35 So then they gave them the battle with all speed. </p>
 <p>36 Howbeit they answered them not, neither cast they a stone at them, nor stopped the places where they lay hid; </p>
 <p>37 But said, Let us die all in our innocency: heaven and earth will testify for us, that ye put us to death wrongfully. </p>
 <p>38 So they rose up against them in battle on the sabbath, and they slew them, with their wives and children and their cattle, to the number of a thousand people. </p>
 <p>39 Now when Mattathias and his friends understood hereof, they mourned for them right sore. </p>
 <p>40 And one of them said to another, If we all do as our brethren have done, and fight not for our lives and laws against the heathen, they will now quickly root us out of the earth. </p>
 <p>41 At that time therefore they decreed, saying, Whosoever shall come to make battle with us on the sabbath day, we will fight against him; neither will we die all, as our brethren that were murdered im the secret places. </p>
 <p>42 Then came there unto him a company of Assideans who were mighty men of Israel, even all such as were voluntarily devoted unto the law. </p>
 <p>43 Also all they that fled for persecution joined themselves unto them, and were a stay unto them. </p>
 <p>44 So they joined their forces, and smote sinful men in their anger, and wicked men in their wrath: but the rest fled to the heathen for succour. </p>
 <p>45 Then Mattathias and his friends went round about, and pulled down the altars: </p>
 <p>46 And what children soever they found within the coast of Israel uncircumcised, those they circumcised valiantly. </p>
 <p>47 They pursued also after the proud men, and the work prospered in their hand. </p>
 <p>48 So they recovered the law out of the hand of the Gentiles, and out of the hand of kings, neither suffered they the sinner to triumph. </p>
 <p>49 Now when the time drew near that Mattathias should die, he said unto his sons, Now hath pride and rebuke gotten strength, and the time of destruction, and the wrath of indignation: </p>
 <p>50 Now therefore, my sons, be ye zealous for the law, and give your lives for the covenant of your fathers. </p>
 <p>51 Call to remembrance what acts our fathers did in their time; so shall ye receive great honour and an everlasting name. </p>
 <p>52 Was not Abraham found faithful in temptation, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness? </p>
 <p>53 Joseph in the time of his distress kept the commandment and was made lord of Egypt. </p>
 <p>54 Phinees our father in being zealous and fervent obtained the covenant of an everlasting priesthood. </p>
 <p>55 Jesus for fulfilling the word was made a judge in Israel. </p>
 <p>56 Caleb for bearing witness before the congregation received the heritage of the land. </p>
 <p>57 David for being merciful possessed the throne of an everlasting kingdom. </p>
 <p>58 Elias for being zealous and fervent for the law was taken up into heaven. </p>
 <p>59 Ananias, Azarias, and Misael, by believing were saved out of the flame. </p>
 <p>60 Daniel for his innocency was delivered from the mouth of lions. </p>
 <p>61 And thus consider ye throughout all ages, that none that put their trust in him shall be overcome. </p>
 <p>62 Fear not then the words of a sinful man: for his glory shall be dung and worms. </p>
 <p>63 To day he shall be lifted up and to morrow he shall not be found, because he is returned into his dust, and his thought is come to nothing. </p>
 <p>64 Wherefore, ye my sons, be valiant and shew yourselves men in the behalf of the law; for by it shall ye obtain glory. </p>
 <p>65 And behold, I know that your brother Simon is a man of counsel, give ear unto him alway: he shall be a father unto you. </p>
 <p>66 As for Judas Maccabeus, he hath been mighty and strong, even from his youth up: let him be your captain, and fight the battle of the people. </p>
 <p>67 Take also unto you all those that observe the law, and avenge ye the wrong of your people. </p>
 <p>68 Recompense fully the heathen, and take heed to the commandments of the law. </p>
 <p>69 So he blessed them, and was gathered to his fathers. </p>
 <p>70 And he died in the hundred forty and sixth year, and his sons buried him in the sepulchres of his fathers at Modin, and all Israel made great lamentation for him. </p>

 <p>61 καὶ οὕτως ἐννοήθητε κατὰ γενεὰν καὶ γενεάν ὅτι πάντες οἱ ἐλπίζοντες ἐπ᾽ αὐτὸν οὐκ ἀσθενήσουσιν </p>
 <p>62 καὶ ἀπὸ λόγων ἀνδρὸς ἁμαρτωλοῦ μὴ φοβηθῆτε ὅτι ἡ δόξα αὐτοῦ εἰς κόπρια καὶ εἰς σκώληκας </p>
 <p>63 σήμερον ἐπαρθήσεται καὶ αὔριον οὐ μὴ εὑρεθῇ ὅτι ἐπέστρεψεν εἰς τὸν χοῦν αὐτοῦ καὶ ὁ διαλογισμὸς αὐτοῦ ἀπολεῖται </p>
 <p>64 τέκνα ἀνδρίζεσθε καὶ ἰσχύσατε ἐν τῷ νόμῳ ὅτι ἐν αὐτῷ δοξασθήσεσθε </p>
 <p>65 καὶ ἰδοὺ Συμεων ὁ ἀδελφὸς ὑμῶν οἶδα ὅτι ἀνὴρ βουλῆς ἐστιν αὐτοῦ ἀκούετε πάσας τὰς ἡμέρας αὐτὸς ἔσται ὑμῶν πατήρ </p>
 <p>66 καὶ Ιουδας Μακκαβαῖος ἰσχυρὸς δυνάμει ἐκ νεότητος αὐτοῦ αὐτὸς ἔσται ὑμῖν ἄρχων στρατιᾶς καὶ πολεμήσει πόλεμον λαῶν </p>
 <p>67 καὶ ὑμεῖς προσάξετε πρὸς ὑμᾶς πάντας τοὺς ποιητὰς τοῦ νόμου καὶ ἐκδικήσατε ἐκδίκησιν τοῦ λαοῦ ὑμῶν </p>
 <p>68 ἀνταπόδοτε ἀνταπόδομα τοῖς ἔθνεσιν καὶ προσέχετε εἰς πρόσταγμα τοῦ νόμου </p>
 <p>69 καὶ εὐλόγησεν αὐτούς καὶ προσετέθη πρὸς τοὺς πατέρας αὐτοῦ </p>
 <p>70 καὶ ἀπέθανεν ἐν τῷ ἕκτῳ καὶ τεσσαρακοστῷ καὶ ἑκατοστῷ ἔτει καὶ ἐτάφη ἐν τάφοις πατέρων αὐτοῦ ἐν Μωδεϊν καὶ ἐκόψαντο αὐτὸν πᾶς Ισραηλ κοπετὸν μέγαν </p>

 <p>2 et habebat filios quinque, Joannem, qui cognominabatur Gaddis:</p>
 <p>3 et Simonem, qui cognominabatur Thasi:</p>
 <p>4 et Judam, qui vocabatur Machabæus:</p>
 <p>5 et Eleazarum, qui cognominabatur Abaron: et Jonathan, qui cognominabatur Apphus:</p>
 <p>6 hi viderunt mala, quæ fiebant in populo Juda, et in Jerusalem.</p>
 <p>7 Et dixit Mathathias: Væ mihi! ut quid natus sum videre contritionem populi mei, et contritionem civitatis sanctæ, et sedere illic, cum datur in manibus inimicorum?</p>
 <p>8 Sancta in manu extraneorum facta sunt: templum ejus sicut homo ignobilis.</p>
 <p>9 Vasa gloriæ ejus captiva abducta sunt: trucidati sunt senes ejus in plateis, et juvenes ejus ceciderunt in gladio inimicorum.</p>
 <p>10 Quæ gens non hæreditavit regnum ejus et non obtinuit spolia ejus?</p>
 <p>11 Omnis compositio ejus ablata est. Quæ erat libera, facta est ancilla.</p>
 <p>12 Et ecce sancta nostra, et pulchritudo nostra, et claritas nostra desolata est, et coinquinaverunt ea gentes.</p>
 <p>13 Quo ergo nobis adhuc vivere?</p>
 <p>14 Et scidit vestimenta sua Mathathias, et filii ejus: et operuerunt se ciliciis, et planxerunt valde.<br>
 </p>
 <p>15 Et venerunt illuc qui missi erant a rege Antiocho, ut cogerent eos, qui confugerant in civitatem Modin, immolare, et accendere thura, et a lege Dei discedere.</p>
 <p>16 Et multi de populo Israël consentientes accesserunt ad eos: sed Mathathias et filii ejus constanter steterunt.</p>
 <p>17 Et respondentes qui missi erant ab Antiocho, dixerunt Mathathiæ: Princeps, et clarissimus et magnus es in hac civitate, et ornatus filiis et fratribus:</p>
 <p>18 ergo accede prior, et fac jussum regis, sicut fecerunt omnes gentes, et viri Juda, et qui remanserunt in Jerusalem: et eris tu, et filii tui, inter amicos regis, et amplificatus auro, et argento, et muneribus multis.</p>
 <p>19 Et respondit Mathathias, et dixit magna voce: Etsi omnes gentes regi Antiocho obediunt, ut discedat unusquisque a servitute legis patrum suorum, et consentiat mandatis ejus:</p>
 <p>20 ego et filii mei, et fratres mei, obediemus legi patrum nostrorum:</p>
 <p>21 propitius sit nobis Deus: non est nobis utile relinquere legem, et justitias Dei:</p>
 <p>22 non audiemus verba regis Antiochi, nec sacrificabimus transgredientes legis nostræ mandata, ut eamus altera via.</p>
 <p>23 Et ut cessavit loqui verba hæc, accessit quidam Judæus in omnium oculis sacrificare idolis super aram in civitate Modin, secundum jussum regis:</p>
 <p>24 et vidit Mathathias, et doluit, et contremuerunt renes ejus, et accensus est furor ejus secundum judicium legis, et insiliens trucidavit eum super aram:</p>
 <p>25 sed et virum, quem rex Antiochus miserat, qui cogebat immolare, occidit in ipso tempore, et aram destruxit:</p>
 <p>26 et zelatus est legem, sicut fecit Phinees Zamri filio Salomi.</p>
 <p>27 Et exclamavit Mathathias voce magna in civitate, dicens: Omnis qui zelum habet legis, statuens testamentum, exeat post me.</p>
 <p>28 Et fugit ipse, et filii ejus in montes, et reliquerunt quæcumque habebant in civitate.<br>
 </p>
 <p>29 Tunc descenderunt multi quærentes judicium, et justitiam, in desertum:</p>
 <p>30 et sederunt ibi ipsi, et filii eorum, et mulieres eorum, et pecora eorum: quoniam inundaverunt super eos mala.</p>
 <p>31 Et renuntiatum est viris regis, et exercitui qui erat in Jerusalem civitate David, quoniam discessissent viri quidam, qui dissipaverunt mandatum regis, in loca occulta in deserto, et abiissent post illos multi.</p>
 <p>32 Et statim perrexerunt ad eos, et constituerunt adversus eos prælium in die sabbatorum,</p>
 <p>33 et dixerunt ad eos: Resistitis et nunc adhuc? exite, et facite secundum verbum regis Antiochi, et vivetis.</p>
 <p>34 Et dixerunt: Non exibimus, neque faciemus verbum regis, ut polluamus diem sabbatorum.</p>
 <p>35 Et concitaverunt adversus eos prælium.</p>
 <p>36 Et non responderunt eis, nec lapidem miserunt in eos, nec oppilaverunt loca occulta,</p>
 <p>37 dicentes: Moriamur omnes in simplicitate nostra: et testes erunt super nos cælum et terra, quod injuste perditis nos.</p>
 <p>38 Et intulerunt illis bellum sabbatis: et mortui sunt ipsi, et uxores eorum, et filii eorum, et pecora eorum usque ad mille animas hominum.</p>
 <p>39 Et cognovit Mathathias et amici ejus, et luctum habuerunt super eos valde.</p>
 <p>40 Et dixit vir proximo suo: Si omnes fecerimus sicut fratres nostri fecerunt, et non pugnaverimus adversus gentes pro animabus nostris et justificationibus nostris, nunc citius disperdent nos a terra.</p>
 <p>41 Et cogitaverunt in die illa, dicentes: Omnis homo, quicumque venerit ad nos in bello die sabbatorum, pugnemus adversus eum: et non moriemur omnes, sicut mortui sunt fratres nostri in occultis.<br>
 </p>
 <p>42 Tunc congregata est ad eos synagoga Assidæorum fortis viribus ex Israël, omnis voluntarius in lege:</p>
 <p>43 et omnes, qui fugiebant a malis, additi sunt ad eos, et facti sunt illis ad firmamentum.</p>
 <p>44 Et collegerunt exercitum, et percusserunt peccatores in ira sua, et viros iniquos in indignatione sua: et ceteri fugerunt ad nationes, ut evaderent.</p>
 <p>45 Et circuivit Mathathias et amici ejus, et destruxerunt aras:</p>
 <p>46 et circumciderunt pueros incircumcisos quotquot invenerunt in finibus Israël: et in fortitudine.</p>
 <p>47 Et persecuti sunt filios superbiæ, et prosperatum est opus in manibus eorum:</p>
 <p>48 et obtinuerunt legem de manibus gentium, et de manibus regum, et non dederant cornu peccatori.<br>
 </p>
 <p>49 Et appropinquaverunt dies Mathathiæ moriendi, et dixit filiis suis: Nunc confortata est superbia, et castigatio, et tempus eversionis, et ira indignationis.</p>
 <p>50 Nunc ergo, o filii, æmulatores estote legis, et date animas vestras pro testamento patrum vestrorum,</p>
 <p>51 et mementote operum patrum, quæ fecerunt in generationibus suis: et accipietis gloriam magnam, et nomen æternum.</p>
 <p>52 Abraham nonne in tentatione inventus est fidelis, et reputatum est ei ad justitiam?</p>
 <p>53 Joseph in tempore angustiæ suæ custodivit mandatum, et factus est dominus Ægypti.</p>
 <p>54 Phinees pater noster, zelando zelum Dei, accepit testamentum sacerdotii æterni.</p>
 <p>55 Jesus dum implevit verbum, factus est dux in Israël.</p>
 <p>56 Caleb dum testificatur in ecclesia, accepit hæreditatem.</p>
 <p>57 David in sua misericordia consecutus est sedem regni in sæcula.</p>
 <p>58 Elias, dum zelat zelum legis, receptus est in cælum.</p>
 <p>59 Ananias et Azarias et Misaël credentes, liberati sunt de flamma.</p>
 <p>60 Daniel in sua simplicitate liberatus est de ore leonum.</p>
 <p>61 Et ita cogitate per generationem et generationem: quia omnes qui sperant in eum, non infirmantur.</p>
 <p>62 Et a verbis viri peccatoris ne timueritis, quia gloria ejus stercus et vermis est:</p>
 <p>63 hodie extollitur, et cras non invenietur: quia conversus est in terram suam, et cogitatio ejus periit.</p>
 <p>64 Vos ergo filii, confortamini, et viriliter agite in lege: quia in ipsa gloriosi eritis.</p>
 <p>65 Et ecce Simon frater vester, scio quod vir consilii est: ipsum audite semper, et ipse erit vobis pater.</p>
 <p>66 Et Judas Machabæus, fortis viribus a juventute sua, sit vobis princeps militiæ, et ipse aget bellum populi.</p>
 <p>67 Et adducetis ad vos omnes factores legis: et vindicate vindictam populi vestri.</p>
 <p>68 Retribuite retributionem gentibus, et intendite in præceptum legis.<br>
 </p>
 <p>69 Et benedixit eos, et appositus est ad patres suos.</p>
 <p>70 Et defunctus est anno centesimo et quadragesimo sexto: et sepultus est a filiis suis in sepulchris patrum suorum in Modin, et planxerunt eum omnis Israël planctu magno.</p>
