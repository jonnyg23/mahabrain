 <p><a name="an_deu:21:1">1</a> If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not known who hath smitten him; <a name="an_deu:21:2">2</a> then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that is slain. <a name="an_deu:21:3">3</a> And it shall be, that the city which is nearest unto the slain man, even the elders of that city shall take a heifer of the herd, which hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the yoke. <a name="an_deu:21:4">4</a> And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a rough valley, which may neither be plowed nor sown, and shall break the heifer's neck there in the valley. <a name="an_deu:21:5">5</a> And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near—for them the LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto Him, and to bless in the name of the LORD; and according to their word shall every controversy and every stroke be. <a name="an_deu:21:6">6</a> And all the elders of that city, who are nearest unto the slain man, shall wash their hands over tin heifer whose neck was broken in the valley. <a name="an_deu:21:7">7</a> And they shall speak and say: `Our hands have not shed this blood, neither have our eyes seen it. <a name="an_deu:21:8">8</a> Forgive, O LORD, Thy people Israel whom Thou hast redeemed, and suffer not innocent blood to remain in the midst of Thy people Israel.' And the blood shall be forgiven them. <a name="an_deu:21:9">9</a> So shalt thou put away the innocent blood from the midst of thee, when thou shalt do that which is right in the eyes of the LORD.</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center">‏כי תצא‎</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:21:10">10</a> When thou goest forth to battle against thine enemies, and the LORD thy God delivereth them into thy hands, and thou carriest them away captive, <a name="an_deu:21:11">11</a> and seest among the captives a woman of goodly form, and thou hast a desire unto her, and wouldest take her to thee to wife; <a name="an_deu:21:12">12</a> then thou shalt bring her home to thy house; and she shall shave her head, and pare her nails; <a name="an_deu:21:13">13</a> and she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her, and shall remain in thy house, and bewail her father and her mother a full month; and after that thou mayest go in unto her, and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife. <a name="an_deu:21:14">14</a> And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her at all for money, thou shalt not deal with her as a slave, because thou hast humbled her.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:21:15">15</a> If a man have two wives, the one beloved, and the other hated, and they have borne him children, both the beloved and the hated; and if the first-born son be hers that was hated; <a name="an_deu:21:16">16</a> then it shall be, in the day that he causeth his sons to inherit that which he hath, that he may not make the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_239"><font size="1" color="green">p. 239</font></a></p>  
 <p>son of the beloved the first-born before the son of the hated, who is the first-born; <a name="an_deu:21:17">17</a> but he shall acknowledge the first-born, the son of the hated, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath; for he is the first-fruits of his strength; the right of the first-born is his.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:21:18">18</a> If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, that will not hearken to the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and though they chasten him, will not hearken unto them; <a name="an_deu:21:19">19</a> then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate of his place; <a name="an_deu:21:20">20</a> and they shall say unto the elders of his city: `This our son is stubborn and rebellious, he doth not hearken to our voice; he is a glutton, and a drunkard.' <a name="an_deu:21:21">21</a> And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that he die; so shalt thou put away the evil from the midst of thee; and all Israel shall hear, and fear.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_deu:21:22">22</a> And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree; <a name="an_deu:21:23">23</a> his body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou shalt surely bury him the same day; for he that is hanged is a reproach unto God; that thou defile not thy land which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.</p>
