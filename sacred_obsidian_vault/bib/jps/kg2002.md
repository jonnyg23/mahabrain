 <p><a name="an_kg2:2:1">1</a> And it came to pass, when the LORD would take up Elijah by a whirlwind into heaven, that Elijah went with Elisha from Gilgal. <a name="an_kg2:2:2">2</a> And Elijah said unto Elisha: `Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me as far as Beth-el.' And Elisha said: `As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' So they went down to Beth-el.—<a name="an_kg2:2:3">3</a> And the sons of the prophets that were at Beth-el came forth to Elisha, and said unto him: `Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day?' And he said: `Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.'—<a name="an_kg2:2:4">4</a> And Elijah said unto him: `Elisha, tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to Jericho.' And he said: `As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' So they came to Jericho.—<a name="an_kg2:2:5">5</a> And the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho came near to Elisha, and said unto him: `Knowest thou that the LORD will take away thy master from thy head to-day?' And he answered: `Yea, I know it; hold ye your peace.'—<a name="an_kg2:2:6">6</a> And Elijah said unto him: `Tarry here, I pray thee; for the LORD hath sent me to the Jordan.' And he said: `As the LORD liveth, and as thy soul liveth, I will not leave thee.' And they two went on.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:2:7">7</a> And fifty men of the sons of the prophets went, and stood over against them afar off; and they two stood by the Jordan. <a name="an_kg2:2:8">8</a> And Elijah took his mantle, and wrapped it together, and smote the waters, and they were divided hither and thither, so that they two went over on dry ground. <a name="an_kg2:2:9">9</a> And it came to pass, when they were gone over, that Elijah said unto Elisha: `Ask what I shall do for thee, before I am taken from thee.' And Elisha said: `I pray thee, let a double portion of thy spirit be upon me.' <a name="an_kg2:2:10">10</a> And he said: `Thou hast asked a hard thing; nevertheless, if thou see me when I am taken from thee, it shall be so unto thee; but if not, it shall not be so.' <a name="an_kg2:2:11">11</a> And it came to pass, as they still went on, and talked, that, behold, there appeared a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, which parted them both asunder; and Elijah went up by a whirlwind into heaven.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:2:12">12</a> And Elisha saw it, and he cried: `My father, my father, the chariots of Israel and the horsemen thereof!' And he saw him no more; and he took hold of his own clothes, and rent them in two pieces. <a name="an_kg2:2:13">13</a> He took up also the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and went back, and stood by the bank of the Jordan. <a name="an_kg2:2:14">14</a> And he took the mantle of Elijah that fell from him, and smote the waters, and said: `Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?' and when he also had smitten the waters, they were divided hither and thither; and Elisha went over.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:2:15">15</a> And when the sons of the prophets that were at Jericho some way off</p>  
 <p><a name="page_443"><font size="1" color="green">p. 443</font></a></p>  
 <p>saw him, they said: `The spirit of Elijah doth rest on Elisha.' And they came to meet him, and bowed down to the ground before him. <a name="an_kg2:2:16">16</a> And they said unto him: `Behold now, there are with thy servants fifty strong men; let them go, we pray thee, and seek thy master; lest peradventure the spirit of the LORD hath taken him up, and cast him upon some mountain, or into some valley.' And he said: `Ye shall not send.' <a name="an_kg2:2:17">17</a> And when they urged him till he was ashamed, he said: `Send.' They sent therefore fifty men; and they sought three days, but found him not. <a name="an_kg2:2:18">18</a> And they came back to him, while he tarried at Jericho; and he said unto them: `Did I not say unto you: Go not?'</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:2:19">19</a> And the men of the city said unto Elisha: `Behold, we pray thee, the situation of this city is pleasant, as my lord seeth; but the water is bad, and the land miscarrieth.' <a name="an_kg2:2:20">20</a> And he said: `Bring me a new cruse, and put salt therein.' And they brought it to him. <a name="an_kg2:2:21">21</a> And he went forth unto the spring of the waters, and cast salt therein, and said: `Thus saith the LORD: I have healed these waters; there shall not be from thence any more death or miscarrying.' <a name="an_kg2:2:22">22</a> So the waters were healed unto this day, according to the word of Elisha which he spoke.</p>  
 <p><a name="an_kg2:2:23">23</a> And he went up from thence unto Beth-el; and as he was going up by the way, there came forth little children out of the city, and mocked him, and said unto him: `Go up, thou baldhead; go up, thou baldhead.' <a name="an_kg2:2:24">24</a> And he looked behind him and saw them, and cursed them in the name of the LORD. And there came forth two she-bears out of the wood, and tore forty and two children of them. <a name="an_kg2:2:25">25</a> And he went from thence to mount Carmel,and from thence he returned to Samaria.</p>
