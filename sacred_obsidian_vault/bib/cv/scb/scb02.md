But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy <i>closet</i>, and when thou hast <i>shut thy door</i>, pray to thy Father which is in <i>secret</i>. (Matt. 6:5, 6.)</p>  
 <p> </p>  
 <p align="center"><a name="an_38">38</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">IMPORTUNITY IN PRAYER COMMENDED.</p>  
 <p>Because this widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her <i>continual</i> coming she <i>weary</i> me. . . . And shall not God avenge his own elect, which cry <i>day</i> and <i>night</i> unto him? (Luke 18:5, 7.)</p>

 <p>All the days of the vow of his separation there shall <i>no razor</i> come upon his <i>head;</i> until the days be fulfilled in the which he separateth himself unto the Lord, he shall be holy, and shall let the <i>locks of the hair</i> of his head <i>grow</i>. (Num. 6:5.)</p>

 <p>Remember the <i>Sabbath</i> day to keep it holy. (Ex. 20:8.)</p>  
 <p align="center">THE SABBATH REPUDIATED.</p>  
 <p>The new moons and <i>sabbaths</i>, the calling of assemblies, I cannot away with; it is <i>iniquity</i>. (Is. 1:13.)</p>  
 <p>One man esteemeth one day above another; another esteemeth <i>every day alike</i>. Let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind. (Rom. 14:5.)</p>  
 <p>Let no man therefore judge you in meat and drink, or in respect of a <i>holy day</i>, or of the new moon; or of the <i>sabbath</i><i> days</i>. (Col. 2:16.)</p>

 <p align="center"><a name="an_42">42</a>.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE SABBATH INSTITUTED BECAUSE GOD RESTED ON THE SEVENTH DAY.</p>  
 <p>For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in them is, and <i>rested on the seventh day;</i> wherefore the Lord <i>blessed</i> the Sabbath day and <i>hallowed</i> it. (Ex. 20:11.)</p>  
 <p align="center">THE SABBATH INSTITUTED <b>BECAUSE GOD BROUGHT THE ISRAELITES OUT OF EGYPT</b>.</p>

 <p>And they found a man that <i>gathered sticks</i> upon the Sabbath day. . . . And all the congregation brought him without the camp and <i>stoned</i> him with stones, and <i>he died;</i> as the Lord <i>commanded Moses</i>. (Num. 15:32, 36.)</p>  
 <p align="center">JESUS CHRIST <b>BROKE</b> THE SABBATH AND <b>JUSTIFIED HIS DISCIPLES</b> IN THE SAME.</p>  
 <p>Therefore did the Jews persecute Jesus, and sought to slay him, because he had <i>done these things</i> on the <i>Sabbath day</i>. (John 5:16.)</p>  
 <p>At that time Jesus went on the <i>Sabbath day</i> through the corn; and his disciples were a hungered, and began to pluck the ears of corn, and to eat. But when the Pharisees saw it they said unto him, Behold, thy disciples do that which is <i>not lawful</i> to do upon the Sabbath day. But he said unto them, . . . . Have ye not read in the law, how that on the Sabbath days the priests in the temple <i>profane</i> the Sabbath, and are <i>blameless?</i> (Matt. 12:1, 2, 3, 5.)</p>

 <p>There is <i>nothing unclean</i> of itself. (Rom. 14:14.)</p>  
 <p align="center">CERTAIN KINDS OF ANIMALS <b>PROHIBITED</b> FOR FOOD.</p>  
 <p>Nevertheless, these shall ye <i>not eat</i>, of them that chew the cud or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the <i>camel</i> and the <i>hare</i>, and the <i>coney</i><i>;</i> for they chew the cud, but divide not the hoof; therefore, they are <i>unclean</i> unto you.

 <p>Now, therefore, <i>swear</i> unto me here by God. . . . And Abraham said, I will <i>swear</i>. . . . Therefore, he called the place Beersheba [the well of the oath]; because there they sware both of them. (Gen. 21:23, 24, 31.)</p>  
 <p>And Jacob <i>sware</i> by the fear of his father Isaac. (Gen. 31:53.)</p>  
 <p>Because he [God] could swear by no greater, he <i>sware</i> by himself. (Heb. 6:13.)</p>  
 <p align="center">THE TAKING OF OATHS <b>FORBIDDEN</b>.</p>  
 <p>But I say unto you, <i>swear not at all;</i> neither by heaven for it is God's throne; nor by the earth for it is his footstool. (Matt. 5:34.)</p>
