 <p align="center"><small><i>The Good Shepherd</i>.</small></p>  
 <p>VERILY, verily, I say unto you, He that entereth not by the door into the sheepfold, but climbeth up some other way, the same is a thief and a robber.</p>  
 <p>2 But he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep.</p>  
 <p>3 To him the porter openeth; and the sheep hear his voice: and he calleth his own sheep by name, and leadeth them out.</p>  
 <p>4 And when he putteth forth his own sheep, he goeth before them, and the sheep follow him; for they know his voice.</p>  
 <p>5 And a stranger will they not follow, but will flee from him: for they know not the voice of strangers.</p>  
 <p>6 I am the good shepherd: the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep.</p>  
 <p>7 But he that is an hireling, and not the shepherd, whose own the sheep are not, seeth the wolf coming, and leaveth the sheep, and fleeth: and the wolf catcheth them, and scattereth the sheep.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_87"><font size="1" color="green">p. 87</font></a></p>  
 <p>8 The hireling fleeth, because he is an hireling, and careth not for the sheep.</p>  
 <p>9 I am the good shepherd, and know my <i>sheep</i>, and am known of mine.</p>  
 <p>10 And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one fold, <i>and</i> one shepherd.</p>
