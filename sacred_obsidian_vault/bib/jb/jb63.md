 <p>AND take heed to yourselves, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting, and drunkenness, and cares of this life, and so that day come upon you unawares.</p>  
 <p>2 For as a snare shall it come on all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth.</p>  
 <p>3 Watch ye therefore, and pray always, that ye may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass, and to stand before the Son of man.</p>  
 <p>4 When the Son of man shall come in his glory, and all the holy angels with him, then shall he sit upon the throne of his glory:</p>  
 <p>5 And before him shall be gathered all nations: and he shall separate them one from another, as a shepherd divideth <i>his</i> sheep from the goats:</p>  
 <p>6 And he shall set the sheep on his right hand, but the goats on the left.</p>  
 <p>7 Then shall the King say unto them on his right hand, Come, ye blessed of my Father, inherit</p>  
 <p><a name="page_142"><font size="1" color="green">p. 142</font></a></p>  
 <p>the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world:</p>  
 <p>8 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink: I was a stranger, and ye took me in:</p>  
 <p>9 Naked, and ye clothed me: I was sick, and ye visited me: I was, in prison, and ye came unto me.</p>  
 <p>10 Then shall the righteous answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, and fed <i>thee?</i> or thirsty, and gave <i>thee</i> drink?</p>  
 <p>11 When saw we thee a stranger, and took <i>thee</i> in? or naked, and clothed <i>thee?</i></p>  
 <p>12 Or when saw we thee sick, or in prison, and came unto thee?</p>  
 <p>13 And the King shall answer and say unto them, Verily I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye have done <i>it</i> unto one of the least of these my brethren, ye have done <i>it</i> unto me.</p>  
 <p>14 Then shall he say also unto them on the left hand, Depart from me, ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels:</p>  
 <p>15 For I was an hungred, and ye gave me no meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me no drink:</p>  
 <p><a name="page_143"><font size="1" color="green">p. 143</font></a></p>  
 <p>16 I was a stranger, and ye took me not in: naked, and ye clothed me not: sick, and in prison, and ye visited me not.</p>  
 <p>17 Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw we thee an hungred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did not minister unto thee?</p>  
 <p>18 Then shall he answer them, saying, Verily, I say unto you, Inasmuch as ye did <i>it</i> not to one of the least of these, ye did <i>it</i> not to me.</p>  
 <p>19 And these shall go away into everlasting punishment: but the righteous into life eternal.</p>
