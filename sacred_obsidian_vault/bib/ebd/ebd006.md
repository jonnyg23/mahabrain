 <p><a name="000"><b>Accad</b></a>     The high land or mountains, a city in the land of Shinar. It has been identified with the mounds of Akker Kuf, some 50 miles to the north of Babylon; but this is doubtful. It was one of the cities of Nimrod's kingdom (<a href="../kjv/gen010.htm#010">Gen 10:10</a>). It stood close to the Euphrates, opposite Sippara. (See SEPHARVAIM.) It is also the name of the country of which this city was the capital, namely, northern or upper Babylonia. The Accadians who came from the "mountains of the east," where the ark rested, attained to a high degree of civilization. In the Babylonian inscriptions they are called "the black heads" and "the black faces," in contrast to "the white race" of Semitic descent. They invented the form of writing in pictorial hieroglyphics, and also the cuneiform system, in which they wrote many books partly on papyrus and partly on clay. The Semitic Babylonians ("the white race"), or, as some scholars think, first the Cushites, and afterwards, as a second immigration, the Semites, invaded and conquered this country; and then the Accadian language ceased to be a spoken language, although for the sake of its literary treasures it continued to be studied by the educated classes of Babylonia. A large portion of the Ninevite tablets brought to light by Oriental research consists of interlinear or parallel translations from Accadian into Assyrian; and thus that long-forgotten language has been recovered by scholars. It belongs to the class of languages called agglutinative, common to the Tauranian race; i.e., it consists of words "glued together," without declension of conjugation. These tablets in a remarkable manner illustrate ancient history. Among other notable records, they contain an account of the Creation which closely resembles that given in the book of Genesis, of the Sabbath as a day of rest, and of the Deluge and its cause. (See BABYLONIA, CHALDEA.)

 <p><a name="001"><b>Accho</b></a>     Sultry or sandy, a town and harbor of Phoenicia, in the tribe of Asher, but never acquired by them (<a href="../kjv/jdg001.htm#031">Jdg 1:31</a>). It was known to the ancient Greeks and Romans by the name of Ptolemais, from Ptolemy the king of Egypt, who rebuilt it about 100 B.C.. Here Paul landed on his last journey to Jerusalem (<a href="../kjv/act021.htm#007">Act 21:7</a>). During the crusades of the Middle Ages it was called Acra; and subsequently, on account of its being occupied by the Knights Hospitallers of Jerusalem, it was called St. Jean d'Acre, or simply Acre.

 <p><a name="002"><b>Accuser</b></a>     Satan is styled the "accuser of the brethren" (<a href="../kjv/rev012.htm#010">Rev 12:10</a>. Compare <a href="../kjv/job001.htm#006">Job 1:6</a>; <a href="../kjv/zac003.htm#001">Zac 3:1</a>), as seeking to uphold his influence among men by bringing false charges against Christians, with the view of weakening their influence and injuring the cause with which they are identified. He was regarded by the Jews as the accuser of men before God, laying to their charge the violations of the law of which they were guilty, and demanding their punishment. The same Greek word, rendered "accuser," is found in <a href="../kjv/joh008.htm#010">Joh 8:10</a> (but omitted in the Revised Version); <a href="../kjv/act023.htm#030">Act 23:30</a>, <a href="../kjv/act023.htm#035">Act 23:35</a>; <a href="../kjv/act024.htm#008">Act 24:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/act025.htm#016">Act 25:16</a>, <a href="../kjv/act025.htm#018">Act 25:18</a>, in all of which places it is used of one who brings a charge against another. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="003"><b>Aceldama</b></a>     The name which the Jews gave in their proper tongue, i.e., in Aramaic, to the field which was purchased with the money which had been given to the betrayer of our Lord. The word means "field of blood." It was previously called "the potter's field" (<a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#007">Mat 27:7</a>, <a href="../kjv/mat027.htm#008">Mat 27:8</a>; <a href="../kjv/act001.htm#019">Act 1:19</a>), and was appropriated as the burial-place for strangers. It lies on a narrow level terrace on the south face of the valley of Hinnom. Its modern name is Hak ed-damm. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="004"><b>Achaia</b></a>     The name originally of a narrow strip of territory in Greece, on the north-west of the Peloponnesus. Subsequently it was applied by the Romans to the whole Peloponnesus, now called the Morea, and the south of Greece. It was then one of the two provinces (Macedonia being the other) into which they divided the country when it fell under their dominion. It is in this latter enlarged meaning that the name is always used in the New Testament (<a href="../kjv/act018.htm#012">Act 18:12</a>, <a href="../kjv/act018.htm#027">Act 18:27</a>; <a href="../kjv/act019.htm#021">Act 19:21</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom015.htm#026">Rom 15:26</a>; <a href="../kjv/rom016.htm#005">Rom 16:5</a>, etc.). It was at the time when Luke wrote the Acts of the Apostles under the proconsul form of government; hence the appropriate title given to Gallio as the "deputy," i.e., proconsul, of Achaia (<a href="../kjv/act018.htm#012">Act 18:12</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="005"><b>Achaichus</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/co1016.htm#017">Co1 16:17</a>), one of the members of the church of Corinth who, with Fortunatus and Stephanas, visited Paul while he was at Ephesus, for the purpose of consulting him on the affairs of the church. These three probably were the bearers of the letter from Corinth to the apostle to which he alludes in <a href="../kjv/co1007.htm#001">Co1 7:1</a>. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="006"><b>Achan</b></a>     Called also Achar, i.e., one who troubles (<a href="../kjv/ch1002.htm#007">Ch1 2:7</a>), in commemoration of his crime, which brought upon him an awful destruction (<a href="../kjv/jos007.htm#001">Jos 7:1</a>). On the occasion of the fall of Jericho, he seized, contrary to the divine command, an ingot of gold, a quantity of silver, and a costly Babylonish garment, which he hid in his tent. Joshua was convinced that the defeat which the Israelites afterwards sustained before Ai was a proof of the divine displeasure on account of some crime, and he at once adopted means by the use of the lot for discovering the criminal. It was then found that Achan was guilty, and he was stoned to death in the valley of Achor. He and all that belonged to him were then consumed by fire, and a heap of stones was raised over the ashes. 
 </p>
 <p><a name="007"><b>Achbor</b></a>     Gnawing = mouse.     (1.) An Edomitish king (<a href="../kjv/gen036.htm#038">Gen 36:38</a>; <a href="../kjv/ch1001.htm#049">Ch1 1:49</a>). (2.) One of Josiah's officers sent to the prophetess Huldah to inquire regarding the newly-discovered book of the law (<a href="../kjv/kg2022.htm#012">Kg2 22:12</a>, <a href="../kjv/kg2022.htm#014">Kg2 22:14</a>). He is also called Abdon (<a href="../kjv/ch2034.htm#020">Ch2 34:20</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="008"><b>Achish</b></a>     Angry, perhaps only a general title of royalty applicable to the Philistine kings.     (1.) The king with whom David sought refuge when he fled from Saul (<a href="../kjv/sa1021.htm#010">Sa1 21:10</a>). He is called Abimelech in the superscription of Ps. 34. It was probably this same king to whom David a second time repaired at the head of a band of 600 warriors, and who assigned him Ziklag, whence he carried on war against the surrounding tribes (<a href="../kjv/sa1027.htm#005">Sa1 27:5</a>). Achish had great confidence in the valor and fidelity of David (<a href="../kjv/sa1028.htm#001">Sa1 28:1</a>, <a href="../kjv/sa1028.htm#002">Sa1 28:2</a>), but at the instigation of his courtiers did not permit him to go up to battle along with the Philistine hosts (<a href="../kjv/sa1029.htm#002">Sa1 29:2</a>). David remained with Achish a year and four months. (2.) Another king of Gath, probably grandson of the foregoing, to whom the two servants of Shimei fled. This led Shimei to go to Gath in pursuit of them, and the consequence was that Solomon put him to death (<a href="../kjv/kg1002.htm#039">Kg1 2:39</a>). 
 </p>
 <p><a name="009"><b>Achmetha</b></a>     (<a href="../kjv/ezr006.htm#002">Ezr 6:2</a>), called Ecbatana by classical writers, the capital of northern Media. Here was the palace which was the residence of the old Median monarchs, and of Cyrus and Cambyses. In the time of Ezra, the Persian kings resided usually at Susa of Babylon. But Cyrus held his court at Achmetha; and Ezra, writing a century after, correctly mentions the place where the decree of Cyrus was found.
