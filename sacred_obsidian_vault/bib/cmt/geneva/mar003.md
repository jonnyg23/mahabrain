 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#001">Mark 3:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">mar 3:1</a></font></span></p>And (1) he entered again into the synagogue; and there was a man there which had a (a) withered hand. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) Thirdly, because they preferred the ceremonial law (which was but an addition to the moral law) before the moral law, whereas in reality they should have learned from this the true use of the ceremonial law. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) That is, unprofitable and dead.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#004">Mark 3:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mar 3:4</a></font></span></p>And he saith unto them, Is it lawful to do good on the sabbath days, or to do evil? to save (b) life, or to kill? But they held their peace. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) He uses here the figure of speech called synecdoche, for this type of saying, "to save the life", is the same as saying "to save the man".  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005">Mark 3:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mar 3:5</a></font></span></p>And when he had looked round about on them (c) with anger, being grieved for the (d) hardness of their hearts, he saith unto the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he stretched [it] out: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Men are angry when they have wrong done to them, but not without sin: but Christ is angry without sin, and he is not sorry for the injury that is done to him as much as he is for their wickedness; and therefore he had pity upon them, and because of that he is said to have been grieved. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) As though their heart had been closed up and had grown together, so that wholesome doctrine had no effect upon them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#006">Mark 3:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mar 3:6</a></font></span></p>(2) And the Pharisees went forth, and straightway took counsel with the (e) Herodians against him, how they might destroy him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) The more the truth is suppressed, the more it comes out. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) See (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#016">Mat 22:16</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#008">Mark 3:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mar 3:8</a></font></span></p>And from Jerusalem, and from Idumaea, and [from] (f) beyond Jordan; and they about Tyre and Sidon, a great multitude, when they had heard what great things he did, came unto him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Which Josephus called stony or rocky.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#009">Mark 3:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mar 3:9</a></font></span></p>And he spake to his disciples, that a small ship should (g) wait on him because of the multitude, lest they should throng him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Should always be ready for him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#010">Mark 3:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mar 3:10</a></font></span></p>For he had healed many; insomuch that they pressed upon him for to touch him, as many as had (h) plagues. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Diseases with which God scourges men as it were with whips.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#011">Mark 3:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mar 3:11</a></font></span></p>And (i) unclean spirits, when they saw him, fell down before him, and cried, saying, Thou art the Son of God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) In those whom they had entered into: or by the figure of speech called metonymy, it refers to those who were vexed with the unclean spirits.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#014">Mark 3:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mar 3:14</a></font></span></p>(3) And he (k) ordained twelve, that they should be with him, and that he might send them forth to preach, 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) The twelve apostles are set apart to be trained for the office of the apostleship. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(k) Chose and appointed twelve to be familiar and well acquainted with him.

 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Whom Luke also calls Judas: and to make a distinction the other Judas is called Iscariot.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#019">Mark 3:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">mar 3:19</a></font></span></p>And Judas Iscariot, which also betrayed him: and they went into an (m) house. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) The disciples whom Christ had taken as part of his company and to live with him come home to his house, to be with him from this point on.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#021">Mark 3:21</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(4) None are worse enemies of the gospel than they that should be enemies of it the least. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) Literally, "they that were of him", that is, his relatives: for they that were mad were brought to their relatives.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">mar 3:28</a></font></span></p>(5) Verily I say unto you, All sins shall be forgiven unto the sons of men, and blasphemies wherewith soever they shall blaspheme: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) Only those who know Christ and maliciously attack him are without hope of salvation.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#030">Mark 3:30</a></p>
