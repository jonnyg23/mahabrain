 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#001">John 16:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">joh 16:1</a></font></span></p>These (1) things have I spoken unto you, that ye should not be offended. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(1) The ministers of the gospel must expect all types of reproaches, not only by those who are open enemies, but even by those also who seem to be of the same household, and the very pillars of the Church.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#007">John 16:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">joh 16:7</a></font></span></p>(2) Nevertheless I tell you the truth; It is expedient for you that I go away: for if I go not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will send him unto you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(2) The absence of Christ according to the flesh is profitable to the Church in that it causes the Church to be wholly dependant upon his spiritual power.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#008">John 16:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">joh 16:8</a></font></span></p>(3) And when he is come, he will (a) reprove the (b) world of sin, and of righteousness, and of judgment: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(3) The Spirit of God works so mightily by the preaching of the word that he forces the world, whether or not it wants to, to confess its own unrighteousness and Christ's righteousness and almightiness. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(a) He will so reprove the world, that those of the world will not be able to give any excuse. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(b) He refers to the time that followed his ascension, when as all those opposed were manifestly reproved, through the pouring out of the Holy Spirit upon the Church: so that the very enemies of Christ were reproved of sin, in that they were forced to confess that they were deceived, in that they believed not, and therefore they said to Peter in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#037">Act 2:37</a>), "Men and brethren, what shall we do?"  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#010">John 16:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">joh 16:10</a></font></span></p>Of (c) righteousness, because I go to my Father, and ye see me no more; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Of Christ himself: for when the world will see that I have poured out the Holy Spirit they will be forced to confess that I was just, and was not condemned by my Father when I went out of this world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#011">John 16:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">joh 16:11</a></font></span></p>Of (d) judgment, (e) because the prince of this world is judged. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Of that authority and power which I have both in heaven and in earth. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) That is, because they will then understand and indeed know that I have overcome the devil, and govern the world, and then all men will see that they set themselves against you in vain, for I will arm you with heavenly power by which you may destroy every high thing which is lifted up against the knowledge of God; (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2010.htm#005">Co2 10:5</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#012">John 16:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">joh 16:12</a></font></span></p>(4) I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye cannot bear them now. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(4) The doctrine of the apostles proceeded from the Holy Spirit, and is most perfect.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#014">John 16:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">joh 16:14</a></font></span></p>(5) He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall shew [it] unto you. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(5) The Holy Spirit brings no new doctrine, but teaches that which was uttered by Christ's own mouth, and imprints it in our minds.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#016">John 16:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">joh 16:16</a></font></span></p>(6) A (f) little while, and ye shall not see me: and again, a little while, and ye shall see me, (g) because I go to the Father. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(6) The grace of the Holy Spirit is a most distinct mirror in which Christ is truly beheld with the most sharp sighted eyes of faith, and not with the blurred eyes of the flesh: and by this we feel a continual joy even in the midst of sorrows. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(f) When a little time is past. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(g) For I go on to eternal glory, so that I will be much more present with you than I was before: for then you will feel indeed what I am, and what I am able to do.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#025">John 16:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">joh 16:25</a></font></span></p>(7) These things have I spoken unto you in proverbs: but the time cometh, when I shall no more speak unto you in proverbs, but I shall shew you plainly of the Father. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(7) The Holy Spirit, who was poured upon the apostles after the ascension of Christ, instructed both them in all the central mysteries and secrets of our salvation, and also the Church by them, and he will also instruct the Church until the end of the world.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#026">John 16:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">joh 16:26</a></font></span></p>(8) At that day ye shall ask in my name: and I say not unto you, that I will pray the Father for you: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(8) The sum of the worship of God is the invocation of the Father in the name of the Son the mediator, who is already heard for us, for whom he both abased himself, and is now also glorified.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#029">John 16:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">joh 16:29</a></font></span></p>(9) His disciples said unto him, Lo, now speakest thou plainly, and speakest no proverb. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(9) Faith and foolish security differ greatly.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#032">John 16:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">joh 16:32</a></font></span></p>(10) Behold, the hour cometh, yea, is now come, that ye shall be scattered, every man to his own, and shall leave me alone: and yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(10) Neither the wickedness of the world, neither the weakness of his own, can diminish anything of the virtue of Christ.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh016.htm#033">John 16:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">joh 16:33</a></font></span></p>(11) These things I have spoken unto you, that (h) in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but be of good cheer; I have overcome the world. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(11) The surety and foundation of the Church depends only upon the victory of Christ. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(h) That in me you might be thoroughly quieted. For by "peace" is meant here that quiet state of mind which is completely contrary to disquietness and great sadness.
