 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#002">Exodus 23:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">exo 23:2</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not follow a multitude to [do] evil; neither shalt thou speak in a cause (a) to decline after many to wrest [judgment]: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Do that which is godly, though few favour it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#004">Exodus 23:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">exo 23:4</a></font></span></p>If thou meet thine enemy's ox or his ass going astray, thou shalt surely (b) bring it back to him again. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) If we are bound to do good to our enemies beast, how much more to our enemy himself, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Mat 5:44</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#005">Exodus 23:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">exo 23:5</a></font></span></p>If thou see the (c) ass of him that hateth thee lying under his burden, and wouldest forbear to help him, thou shalt surely help with him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) If God commands us to help our enemy's donkey under his burden, will he suffer us to cast down our brethren with heavy burdens?  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#007">Exodus 23:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">exo 23:7</a></font></span></p>Keep thee far from a false matter; and the (d) innocent and righteous slay thou not: for I will not justify the wicked. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Whether you are the magistrate or are commanded by the magistrate.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#009">Exodus 23:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">exo 23:9</a></font></span></p>Also thou shalt not oppress a stranger: for ye know the (e) heart of a stranger, seeing ye were strangers in the land of Egypt. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) For since he is a stranger, his heart is sorrowful enough.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#013">Exodus 23:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">exo 23:13</a></font></span></p>And in all [things] that I have said unto you be circumspect: and make (f) no mention of the name of other gods, neither let it be heard out of thy mouth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Neither by swearing by them, nor speaking of them, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa016.htm#004">Psa 16:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#003">Eph 5:3</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">exo 23:15</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt keep the feast of (g) unleavened bread: (thou shalt eat unleavened bread seven days, as I commanded thee, in the time appointed of the month Abib; for in it thou camest out from Egypt: and none shall appear before me empty:) 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) That is, Easter, in remembrance that the angel passed over and spared the Israelites, when he slew the first born of the Egyptians.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#016">Exodus 23:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">exo 23:16</a></font></span></p>And the (h) feast of harvest, the firstfruits of thy labours, which thou hast sown in the field: and the (i) feast of ingathering, [which is] in the end of the year, when thou hast gathered in thy labours out of the field. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Which is Whit Sunday, in token that the law was given 50 days after they departed from Egypt. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(i) This is the feast of tabernacles, signifying that they lived for 40 years in the tents or the tabernacles in the wilderness.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#018">Exodus 23:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">exo 23:18</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with (k) leavened bread; neither shall the fat of my sacrifice remain until the morning.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#019">Exodus 23:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">exo 23:19</a></font></span></p>The first of the firstfruits of thy land thou shalt bring into the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his (l) mother's milk. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) Meaning, that no fruit should be taken before just time: and by this all cruel and wanton appetites are controlled.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#021">Exodus 23:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">exo 23:21</a></font></span></p>Beware of him, and obey his voice, provoke him not; for he will not pardon your transgressions: for my (m) name [is] in him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) I will give him my authority, and he will govern you in my name.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#024">Exodus 23:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">exo 23:24</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt not bow down to their gods, nor serve them, nor do after their works: but thou shalt (n) utterly overthrow them, and quite break down their images. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) God commands his own to not only not worship idols, but to destroy them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#025">Exodus 23:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">exo 23:25</a></font></span></p>And ye shall serve the LORD your God, and he shall bless thy (o) bread, and thy water; and I will take sickness away from the midst of thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) That is, all things necessary for this present life.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#027">Exodus 23:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">exo 23:27</a></font></span></p>I will send my (p) fear before thee, and will destroy all the people to whom thou shalt come, and I will make all thine enemies turn their backs unto thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(p) I will make them afraid of your coming and send my angel to destroy them, as in (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo035.htm#002">Exo 35:2</a>).  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#031">Exodus 23:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">exo 23:31</a></font></span></p>And I will set thy bounds from the Red sea even unto the sea (q) of the Philistines, and from the (r) desert unto the (s) river: for I will deliver the inhabitants of the land into your hand; and thou shalt drive them out before thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(q) Called the Sea of Syria. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(r) Of Arabia called desert.
