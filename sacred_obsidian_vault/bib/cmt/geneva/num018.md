 <p>
 </p><p>(a) If you trespass in anything concerning the ceremonies of the sanctuary of your office, you will be punished.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#003">Numbers 18:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">num 18:3</a></font></span></p>And they shall (b) keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, the things which are committed to you, or, which you command them.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#004">Numbers 18:4</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(c) Which was not of the tribe of Levi.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#008">Numbers 18:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">num 18:8</a></font></span></p>And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of mine heave (d) offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) As the first fruit, first born, and the tithes.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#009">Numbers 18:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">num 18:9</a></font></span></p>This shall be thine of the most holy things, [reserved] from the (e) fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat offering of theirs, and every sin offering of theirs, and every trespass offering of theirs, which they shall render unto me, [shall be] most holy for thee and for thy sons. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) That which was not burned should be the priests.

 <p>
 </p><p>(f) That is, in the sanctuary between the court and the holiest of holies.

 <p>
 </p><p>(g) Read (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev010.htm#014">Lev 10:14</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>(i) Because they are appointed for sacrifice.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#019">Numbers 18:19</a></p>

 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, sure, stable and incorruptible.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020">Numbers 18:20</a></p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">num 18:23</a></font></span></p>But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they shall bear (n) their iniquity: [it shall be] a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the children of Israel they have no inheritance. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(n) If they fail in their office, they will be punished.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#027">Numbers 18:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">num 18:27</a></font></span></p>And [this] your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as though [it were] the (o) corn of the threshingfloor, and as the fulness of the winepress. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(o) As acceptable as the fruit of your own ground or vineyard.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#029">Numbers 18:29</a></p>
