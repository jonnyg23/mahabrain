 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#001">Psalms 62:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">psa 62:1</a></font></span></p>"To the chief Musician, to Jeduthun, A Psalm of David." Truly (a) my soul waiteth upon God: from him [cometh] my salvation. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) Though Satan tempted him to murmur against God, yet he bridled his affections, and resting on God's promise.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#002">Psalms 62:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">psa 62:2</a></font></span></p>(b) He only [is] my rock and my salvation; [he is] my defence; I shall not be greatly moved. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) It appears by the often repetition of this word, that the prophet endured many temptations by resting on God and by patience he overcame them all.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#003">Psalms 62:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">psa 62:3</a></font></span></p>How long will ye imagine mischief against a (c) man? ye shall be slain all of you: as a (d) bowing wall [shall ye be, and as] a tottering fence. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) He means himself, being the man whom God had appointed to the kingdom. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(d) Though you seem to be in honour, yet God will suddenly destroy you.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#005">Psalms 62:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">psa 62:5</a></font></span></p>(e) My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation [is] from him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) David was greatly moved by these troubles, therefore he stirs up himself to trust in God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#007">Psalms 62:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">psa 62:7</a></font></span></p>In God [is] my salvation and my (f) glory: the rock of my strength, [and] my refuge, [is] in God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) These vehement and often repetitions were necessary to strengthen his faith against the horrible assault of Satan.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#008">Psalms 62:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">psa 62:8</a></font></span></p>Trust in him at all times; [ye] people, (g) pour out your heart before him: God [is] a refuge for us. Selah. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) He admonishes us of our wicked nature, which would rather hide our sorrow and bite the bridle, than utter our grief to God to obtain remedy.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#010">Psalms 62:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">psa 62:10</a></font></span></p>Trust not in oppression, and (h) become not vain in robbery: if riches increase, set not your heart [upon them]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Give yourselves wholly to God by putting away all things that are contrary to his law.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#011">Psalms 62:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">psa 62:11</a></font></span></p>God hath spoken (i) once; twice have I heard this; that power [belongeth] unto God. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He has plainly born witness to his power, so that no one needs to doubt it.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa062.htm#012">Psalms 62:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">psa 62:12</a></font></span></p>Also unto thee, O Lord, [belongeth] mercy: for thou (k) renderest to every man according to his work. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) So that the wicked will feel your power, and the godly your mercy.
