 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#018">Job 8:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">job 8:18</a></font></span></p>If he destroy him from his place, then [it] shall (k) deny him, [saying], I have not seen thee. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That is, so that there remains nothing there to prove whether the tree had grown there or not.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#019">Job 8:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 8:19</a></font></span></p>Behold, this [is] the joy (l) of his way, and out of the earth shall others grow. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) To be planted in another place, where it may grow as it pleases.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#021">Job 8:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">job 8:21</a></font></span></p>Till he fill thy mouth with (m) laughing, and thy lips with rejoicing. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(m) If you are godly, he will give you opportunity to rejoice and if not your affliction will increase.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#002">Job 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 8:2</a></font></span></p>How long wilt thou speak these [things]? and [how long shall] the words of thy mouth (a) [be like] a strong wind? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He declares that their words which would diminish anything from the justice of God, are but as a puff of wind that vanishes away.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#004">Job 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">job 8:4</a></font></span></p>If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them away for their (b) transgression; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) That is, has rewarded them according to their iniquity, meaning that Job should be warned by the example of his children, that he not offend God.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#005">Job 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 8:5</a></font></span></p>If thou (c) wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy supplication to the Almighty; 
 <p>
 </p><p>(c) That is, if you turn while God calls you to repentance.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#007">Job 8:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 8:7</a></font></span></p>Though thy beginning (d) was small, yet thy latter end should greatly increase. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) Though the beginning is not as pleasant as you would like, yet in the end you will have sufficient opportunity to please yourself.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#008">Job 8:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 8:8</a></font></span></p>For (e) enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare thyself to the search of their fathers: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) He wills Job to examine all antiquity and he will find it true which he here says.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#009">Job 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">job 8:9</a></font></span></p>(For we [are but of] (f) yesterday, and know nothing, because our days upon earth [are] a shadow:) 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) Meaning, that it is not enough to have the experience of ourselves, but to be confirmed by the examples of those who went before us.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#011">Job 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">job 8:11</a></font></span></p>Can the rush (g) grow up without mire? can the flag grow without water? 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) As a rush cannot grow without moisture, so the hypocrite because he does not have faith which is watered with God's Spirit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#014">Job 8:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 8:14</a></font></span></p>Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust [shall be] a (h) spider's web. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Which is today and tomorrow swept away.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job008.htm#016">Job 8:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 8:16</a></font></span></p>He [is] (i) green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in his garden. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) He compares the just to a tree, which although it is moved from one place to another, yet flourishes: so the affliction of the godly turns to their profit.
