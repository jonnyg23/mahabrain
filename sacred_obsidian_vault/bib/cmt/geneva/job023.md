 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#002">Job 23:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 23:2</a></font></span></p>Even to day [is] my complaint (a) bitter: my stroke is heavier than my groaning. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(a) He shows the just cause of his complaining and concerning that Eliphaz had exhorted him to return to God, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job022.htm#021">Job 22:21</a>) he declares that he desires nothing more, but it seems that God would not be found of him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#006">Job 23:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 23:6</a></font></span></p>Will he (b) plead against me with [his] great power? No; but he would (c) put [strength] in me. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(b) Using his absolute power and saying because I am God, I may do what I will. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(c) Of his mercy he would give me power to answer him.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#007">Job 23:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">job 23:7</a></font></span></p>(d) There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be delivered for ever from my judge. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(d) When he of his mercy has given strength to maintain their cause.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#008">Job 23:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 23:8</a></font></span></p>(e) Behold, I go forward, but he [is] not [there]; and backward, but I cannot perceive him: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(e) Meaning, that if he considers God's justice, he is not able to comprehend his judgments on what side or whatever part he turns himself.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#010">Job 23:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 23:10</a></font></span></p>But he knoweth the (f) way that I take: [when] he hath tried me, I shall come forth as gold. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(f) God has this preeminence about me, that he knows my way: that is, that I am not able to judge his work, he shows also his confidence, that God uses him for his profit.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#012">Job 23:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">job 23:12</a></font></span></p>Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I have (g) esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary [food]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(g) His word is more precious to me than the meat with which the body is sustained.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#013">Job 23:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">job 23:13</a></font></span></p>But he [is] in one [mind], and who can (h) turn him? and [what] his soul desireth, even [that] he doeth. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(h) Job confesses that at the present he did not feel God's favour and yet was assured that God had appointed him to a good end.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#014">Job 23:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 23:14</a></font></span></p>For he performeth [the thing that is] appointed for me: and (i) many such [things are] with him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(i) In many points man is not able to attain to God's judgments.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#016">Job 23:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 23:16</a></font></span></p>For (k) God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me: 
 <p>
 </p><p>(k) That I should not be without fear.  
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job023.htm#017">Job 23:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 23:17</a></font></span></p>Because I was not cut off before the (l) darkness, [neither] hath he covered the darkness from my face. 
 <p>
 </p><p>(l) He shows the cause for his fear, which is, that he being in trouble sees no end, nor yet knows the cause.
