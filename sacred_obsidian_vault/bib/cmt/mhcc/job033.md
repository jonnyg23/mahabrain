 <p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#001">Job 33:1-7</a>) Elihu offers to reason with Job.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#008">Job 33:8-13</a>) Elihu blames Job for reflecting upon God.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014">Job 33:14-18</a>) God calls men to repentance.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019">Job 33:19-28</a>) God sends afflictions for good.
 </p><p>(<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#029">Job 33:29-33</a>) Elihu entreats Job's attention.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 33:1</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Job had desired a judge to decide his appeal. Elihu was one according to his wish, a man like himself. If we would rightly convince men, it must be by reason, not by terror; by fair argument, not by a heavy hand. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#008">Job 33:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 33:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Elihu charges Job with reflecting upon the justice and goodness of God. When we hear any thing said to God's dishonour, we ought to bear our testimony against it. Job had represented God as severe in marking what he did amiss. Elihu urges that he had spoken wrong, and that he ought to humble himself before God, and by repentance to unsay it. God is not accountable to us. It is unreasonable for weak, sinful creatures, to strive with a God of infinite wisdom, power, and goodness. He acts with perfect justice, wisdom, and goodness, where we cannot perceive it. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#014">Job 33:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">job 33:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>God speaks to us by conscience, by providences, and by ministers; of all these Elihu discourses. There was not then, that we know of, any Divine revelation in writing, though now it is our principal guide. When God designs men's good, by the convictions and dictates of their own consciences, he opens the heart, as Lydia's, and opens the ears, so that conviction finds or forces its way in. The end and design of these admonitions are to keep men from sin, particularly the sin of pride. While sinners are pursuing evil purposes, and indulging their pride, their souls are hastening to destruction. That which turns men from sin, saves them from hell. What a mercy it is to be under the restraints of an awakened conscience! 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job033.htm#019">Job 33:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 33:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Job complained of his diseases, and judged by them that God was angry with him; his friends did so too: but Elihu shows that God often afflicts the body for good to the soul. This thought will be of great use for our getting good from sickness, in and by which God speaks to men. Pain is the fruit of sin; yet, by the grace of God, the pain of the body is often made a means of good to the soul. When afflictions have done their work, they shall be removed. A ransom or propitiation is found. Jesus Christ is the Messenger and the Ransom, so Elihu calls him, as Job had called him his Redeemer, for he is both the Purchaser and the Price, the Priest and the sacrifice. So high was the value of souls, that nothing less would redeem them; and so great the hurt done by sin, that nothing less would atone for it, than the blood of the Son of God, who gave his life a ransom for many. A blessed change follows. Recovery from sickness is a mercy indeed, when it proceeds from the remission of sin. All that truly repent of their sins, shall find mercy with God. The works of darkness are unfruitful works; all the gains of sin will come far short of the damage. We must, with a broken and contrite heart, confess our sins to God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#009">Jo1 1:9</a>. We must confess the fact of sin; and not try to justify or excuse ourselves. We must confess the fault of sin; I have perverted that which was right. We must confess the folly of sin; So foolish have I been and ignorant. Is there not good reason why we should make such a confession?

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">job 33:29</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Elihu shows that God's great and gracious design toward the children of men, is, to save them from being for ever miserable, and to bring them to be for ever happy. By whatever means we are kept back from the we shall bless the Lord for them at least, and should bless him for them though they be painful and distressing. Those that perish for ever are without excuse, for they would not be healed.
