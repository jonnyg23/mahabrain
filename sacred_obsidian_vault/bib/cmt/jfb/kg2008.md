 <p>
 </p><p>Then spake Elisha unto the woman--rather "had spoken." The repetition of Elisha's direction to the Shunammite is merely given as an introduction to the following narrative; and it probably took place before the events recorded in chapters 5 and 6. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the Lord hath called for a famine--All such calamities are chastisements inflicted by the hand of God; and this famine was to be of double duration to that one which happened in the time of Elijah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam005.htm#017">Jam 5:17</a>) --a just increase of severity, since the Israelites still continued obdurate and incorrigible under the ministry and miracles of Elisha (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#021">Lev 26:21</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#024">Lev 26:24</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev026.htm#028">Lev 26:28</a>).

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#002">4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">kg2 8:2</a></font></span></p>she . . . sojourned in the land of the Philistines seven years--Their territory was recommended to her from its contiguity to her usual residence; and now that this state had been so greatly reduced, there was less risk than formerly from the seductions of idolatry; and many of the Jews and Israelites were residing there. Besides, an emigration thither was less offensive to the king of Israel than going to sojourn in Judah.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#003">4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">kg2 8:3</a></font></span></p>she went forth to cry unto the king for her house and for her land--In consequence of her long-continued absence from the country, her possessions were occupied by her kindred, or had been confiscated by the crown. No statute in the law of Moses ordained that alienation. But the innovation seems to have been adopted in Israel.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#004">4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">kg2 8:4</a></font></span></p>the king talked with Gehazi--Ceremonial pollution being conveyed by contact alone, there was nothing to prevent a conference being held with this leper at a distance; and although he was excluded from the town of Samaria, this reported conversation may have taken place at the gate or in one of the royal gardens. The providence of God so ordained that King Jehoram had been led to inquire, with great interest, into the miraculous deeds of Elisha, and that the prophet's servant was in the act of relating the marvellous incident of the restoration of the Shunammite's son when she made her appearance to prefer her request. The king was pleased to grant it; and a state officer was charged to afford her every facility in the recovery of her family possession out of the hands of the occupier.

 <p>
 </p><p>Elisha came to Damascus--He was directed thither by the Spirit of God, in pursuance of the mission formerly given to his master in Horeb (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#015">Kg1 19:15</a>), to anoint Hazael king of Syria. On the arrival of the prophet being known, Ben-hadad, who was sick, sent to inquire the issue of his disease, and, according to the practice of the heathens in consulting their soothsayers, ordered a liberal present in remuneration for the service.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#009">4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">kg2 8:9</a></font></span></p>forty camels' burden--The present, consisting of the rarest and most valuable produce of the land, would be liberal and magnificent. But it must not be supposed it was actually so large as to require forty camels to carry it. The Orientals are fond of display, and would, ostentatiously, lay upon forty beasts what might very easily have been borne by four. 
 <p>
 </p><p>Thy son Ben-hadad--so called from the established usage of designating the prophet "father." This was the same Syrian monarch who had formerly persecuted him (see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2006.htm#013">Kg2 6:13-14</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#010">4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">kg2 8:10</a></font></span></p>Go, say . . . Thou mayest certainly recover--There was no contradiction in this message. This part was properly the answer to Ben-hadad's inquiry [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#009">Kg2 8:9</a>]. The second part was intended for Hazael, who, like an artful and ambitious courtier, reported only as much of the prophet's statement as suited his own views (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#014">Kg2 8:14</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#011">4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">kg2 8:11</a></font></span></p>he settled his countenance stedfastly until he was ashamed--that is, Hazael. The steadfast, penetrating look of the prophet seemed to have convinced Hazael that his secret designs were known. The deep emotions of Elisha were justified by the horrible atrocities which, too common in ancient warfare, that successful usurper committed in Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032">Kg2 10:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003">Kg2 13:3-4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#022">Kg2 13:22</a>).
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#015">4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">kg2 8:15</a></font></span></p>took a thick cloth, &amp;c.--a coverlet. In the East, this article of bedding is generally a thick quilt of wool or cotton, so that, with its great weight, when steeped in water, it would be a fit instrument for accomplishing the murderous purpose, without leaving any marks of violence. It has been supposed by many doubtful that Hazael purposely murdered the king. But it is common for Eastern people to sleep with their faces covered with a mosquito net; and, in some cases of fever, they dampen the bedclothes. Hazael, aware of those chilling remedies being usually resorted to, might have, with an honest intention, spread a refreshing cover over him. The rapid occurrence of the king's death and immediate burial were favorable to his instant elevation to the throne.

 <p>
 </p><p>Jehoram the son of Jehoshaphat . . . began to reign--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#001">Kg2 3:1</a>). His father resigned the throne to him two years before his death.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#018">4 Kings (2 Kings) 8:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">kg2 8:18</a></font></span></p>daughter of Ahab--Athaliah, through whose influence Jehoram introduced the worship of Baal and many other evils into the kingdom of Judah (see 2Ch. 21:2-20). This apostasy would have led to the total extinction of the royal family in that kingdom, had it not been for the divine promise to David (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2007.htm#016">Sa2 7:16</a>). A national chastisement, however, was inflicted on Judah by the revolt of Edom, which, being hitherto governed by a tributary ruler (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2003.htm#009">Kg2 3:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1022.htm#047">Kg1 22:47</a>), erected the standard of independence (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2021.htm#009">Ch2 21:9</a>).

 <p>
 </p><p>Ahaziah his son reigned in his stead--(See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2022.htm#001">Ch2 22:1</a>).
