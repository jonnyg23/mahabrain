(Eze. 11:1-25)
 <p>
 </p><p>east gate--to which the glory of God had moved itself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze010.htm#019">Eze 10:19</a>), the chief entrance of the sanctuary; the portico or porch of Solomon. The Spirit moves the prophet thither, to witness, in the presence of the divine glory, a new scene of destruction. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>five and twenty men--The same as the twenty-five (that is, twenty-four heads of courses, and the high priest) sun-worshippers seen in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016">Eze 8:16</a>. The leading priests were usually called "princes of the sanctuary" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa043.htm#028">Isa 43:28</a>) and "chiefs of the priests" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2036.htm#014">Ch2 36:14</a>); but here two of them are called "princes of the people," with irony, as using their priestly influence to be ringleaders of the people in sin (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#002">Eze 11:2</a>). Already the wrath of God had visited the people represented by the elders (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze009.htm#006">Eze 9:6</a>); also the glory of the Lord had left its place in the holy of holies, and, like the cherubim and flaming sword in Eden, had occupied the gate into the deserted sanctuary. The judgment on the representatives of the priesthood naturally follows here, just as the sin of the priests had followed in the description (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#012">Eze 8:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#016">Eze 8:16</a>) after the sin of the elders. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Jaazaniah--signifying "God hears." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>son of Azur--different from Jaazaniah the son of Shaphan (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011">Eze 8:11</a>). Azur means "help." He and Pelatiah ("God delivers"), son of Benaiah ("God builds"), are singled out as Jaazaniah, son of Shaphan, in the case of the seventy elders (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze008.htm#011">Eze 8:11-12</a>), because their names ought to have reminded them that "God" would have "heard" had they sought His "help" to "deliver" and "build" them up. But, neglecting this, they incurred the heavier judgment by the very relation in which they stood to God [FAIRBAIRN].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">eze 11:3</a></font></span></p>It is not near--namely, the destruction of the city; therefore "let us build houses," as if there was no fear. But the Hebrew opposes English Version, which would require the infinitive absolute. Rather, "Not at hand is the building of houses." They sneer at Jeremiah's letter to the captives, among whom Ezekiel lived (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#005">Jer 29:5</a>). "Build ye houses, and dwell in them," that is, do not fancy, as many persuade you, that your sojourn in Babylon is to be short; it will be for seventy years (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer025.htm#011">Jer 25:11-12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer029.htm#010">Jer 29:10</a>); therefore build houses and settle quietly there. The scorners in Jerusalem reply, Those far off in exile may build if they please, but it is too remote a concern for us to trouble ourselves about [FAIRBAIRN], (Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#022">Eze 12:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze012.htm#027">Eze 12:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#004">Pe2 3:4</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>this city . . . caldron . . . we . . . flesh--sneering at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer001.htm#013">Jer 1:13</a>, when he compared the city to a caldron with its mouth towards the north. "Let Jerusalem be so if you will, and we the flesh, exposed to the raging foe from the north, still its fortifications will secure us from the flame of war outside; the city must stand for our sakes, just as the pot exists for the safety of the flesh in it." In opposition to this God says (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#011">Eze 11:11</a>), "This city shall not be your caldron, to defend you in it from the foe outside: nay, ye shall be driven out of your imaginary sanctuary and slain in the border of the land. "But," says God, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#007">Eze 11:7</a>, "your slain are the flesh, and this city the caldron; but (not as you fancy, shall ye be kept safe inside) I will bring you forth out of the midst of it"; and again, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze024.htm#003">Eze 24:3</a>, "Though not a caldron in your sense, Jerusalem shall be so in the sense of its being exposed to a consuming foe, and you yourselves in it and with it."

 <p>

Bloody crimes within the city brought on it a bloody foe from without (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze007.htm#023">Eze 7:23-24</a>). They had made it a caldron in which to boil the flesh of God's people (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mic003.htm#001">Mic 3:1-3</a>), and eat it by unrighteous oppression; therefore God will make it a caldron in a different sense, one not wherein they may be safe in their guilt, but "out of the midst of" which they shall be "brought forth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer034.htm#004">Jer 34:4-5</a>).

 </p><p>
 </p><p>wilt thou make a full end of the remnant--Is Pelatiah's destruction to be the token of the destruction of all, even of the remnant? The people regarded Pelatiah as a mainstay of the city. His name (derived from a Hebrew root, "a remnant," or else "God delivers") suggested hope. Is that hope, asks Ezekiel, to be disappointed?
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#015">Ezekiel 11:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">eze 11:15</a></font></span></p>thy brethren . . . brethren--The repetition implies, "Thy real brethren" are no longer the priests at Jerusalem with whom thou art connected by the natural ties of blood and common temple service, but thy fellow exiles on the Chebar, and the house of Israel whosoever of them belong to the remnant to be spared. 
 <p>
 </p><p>men of thy kindred--literally, "of thy redemption," that is, the nearest relatives, whose duty it was to do the part of Goel, or vindicator and redeemer of a forfeited inheritance (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev025.htm#025">Lev 25:25</a>). Ezekiel, seeing the priesthood doomed to destruction, as a priest, felt anxious to vindicate their cause, as if they were his nearest kinsmen and he their Goel. But he is told to look for his true kinsmen in those, his fellow exiles, whom his natural kinsmen at Jerusalem despised, and he is to be their vindicator. Spiritual ties, as in the case of Levi (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#009">Deu 33:9</a>), the type of Messiah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#047">Mat 12:47-50</a>) are to supersede natural ones where the two clash. The hope of better days was to rise from the despised exiles. The gospel principle is shadowed forth here, that the despised of men are often the chosen of God and the highly esteemed among men are often an abomination before Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk016.htm#015">Luk 16:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1001.htm#026">Co1 1:26-28</a>). "No door of hope but in the valley of Achor" ("trouble," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#015">Hos 2:15</a>), [FAIRBAIRN]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Get you far . . . unto us is this land--the contemptuous words of those left still in the city at the carrying away of Jeconiah to the exiles, "However far ye be outcasts from the Lord and His temple, we are secure in our possession of the land."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze011.htm#016">Ezekiel 11:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">eze 11:16</a></font></span></p>Although--anticipating the objection of the priests at Jerusalem, that the exiles were "cast far off." Though this be so, and they are far from the outer temple at Jerusalem, I will be their asylum or sanctuary instead (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa090.htm#001">Psa 90:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa091.htm#009">Psa 91:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa008.htm#014">Isa 8:14</a>). My shrine is the humble heart: a preparation for gospel catholicity when the local and material temple should give place to the spiritual (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa057.htm#015">Isa 57:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa066.htm#001">Isa 66:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mal001.htm#011">Mal 1:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#021">Joh 4:21-24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#048">Act 7:48-49</a>). The trying discipline of the exile was to chasten the outcasts so as to be meet recipients of God's grace, for which the carnal confidence of the priests disqualified them. The dispersion served the end of spiritualizing and enlarging the views even of the better Jews, so as to be able to worship God everywhere without a material temple; and, at the same time, it diffused some knowledge of God among the greatest Gentile nations, thus providing materials for the gathering in of the Christian Church among the Gentiles; so marvellously did God overrule a present evil for an ultimate good. Still more does all this hold good in the present much longer dispersion which is preparing for a more perfect and universal restoration (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa002.htm#002">Isa 2:2-4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer003.htm#016">Jer 3:16-18</a>). Their long privation of the temple will prepare them for appreciating the more, but without Jewish narrowness, the temple that is to be (Eze. 40:1-44:31). 
 <p>
 </p><p>a little--rather, "for a little season"; No matter how long the captivity may be, the seventy years will be but as a little season, compared with their long subsequent settlement in their land. This holds true only partially in the case of the first restoration; but as in a few centuries they were dispersed again, the full and permanent restoration is yet future (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer024.htm#006">Jer 24:6</a>).

Perhaps it is implied that they and their idols are much alike in character (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa115.htm#008">Psa 115:8</a>). The heart walks astray first, the feet follow.

The mount was chosen as being the height whence the missiles of the foe were about to descend on the city. So it was from it that Jesus ascended to heaven when about to send His judgments on the Jews; and from it He predicted its overthrow before His crucifixion (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat024.htm#003">Mat 24:3</a>). It is also to be the scene of His return in person to deliver His people (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#004">Zac 14:4</a>), when He shall come by the same way as He went, "the way of the east" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze043.htm#002">Eze 43:2</a>).
