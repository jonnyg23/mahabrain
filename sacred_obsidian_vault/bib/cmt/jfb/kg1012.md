 <p>
 </p><p>Rehoboam went to Shechem--He was the oldest, and perhaps the only son of Solomon, and had been, doubtless, designated by his father heir to the throne, as Solomon had been by David. The incident here related took place after the funeral obsequies of the late king and the period for public mourning had past. When all Israel came to make him king, it was not to exercise their old right of election (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#019">Sa1 10:19-21</a>), for, after God's promise of the perpetual sovereignty to David's posterity, their duty was submission to the authority of the rightful heir; but their object was, when making him king, to renew the conditions and stipulations to which their constitutional kings were subject (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#025">Sa1 10:25</a>). To the omission of such rehearsing which, under the peculiar circumstances in which Solomon was made king, they were disposed to ascribe the absolutism of his government. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Shechem--This ancient, venerable, and central town was the place of convocation; and it is evident, if not from the appointment of that place, at least from the tenor of their language, and the concerted presence of Jeroboam [<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#003">Kg1 12:3</a>], that the people were determined on revolt.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">kg1 12:4</a></font></span></p>Thy father made our yoke grievous--The splendor of Solomon's court and the magnitude of his undertakings being such, that neither the tribute of dependent states, nor the presents of foreign princes, nor the profits of his commercial enterprises, were adequate to carry them on, he had been obliged, for obtaining the necessary revenue, to begin a system of heavy taxation. The people looked only to the burdens, not to the benefits they derived from Solomon's peaceful and prosperous reign--and the evils from which they demanded deliverance were civil oppressions, not idolatry, to which they appear to have been indifferent or approving.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">kg1 12:5</a></font></span></p>he said . . . Depart yet for three days--It was prudent to take the people's demand into calm and deliberate consideration. Whether, had the advice of the sage and experienced counsellors been followed, any good result would have followed, it is impossible to say. It would at least have removed all pretext for the separation. [See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2010.htm#007">Ch2 10:7</a>.] But he preferred the counsel of his young companions (not in age, for they were all about forty-one, but inexperienced), who recommended prompt and decisive measures to quell the malcontents.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">kg1 12:15</a></font></span></p>the king hearkened not unto the people, for the cause was from the Lord--That was the overruling cause. Rehoboam's weakness (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc002.htm#018">Ecc 2:18-19</a>) and inexperience in public affairs has given rise to the probable conjecture, that, like many other princes in the East, he had been kept secluded in the harem till the period of his accession (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/ecc004.htm#014">Ecc 4:14</a>), his father being either afraid of his aspiring to the sovereignty, like the two sons of David, or, which is more probable, afraid of prematurely exposing his imbecility. The king's haughty and violent answer to a people already filled with a spirit of discontent and exasperation, indicated so great an incapacity to appreciate the gravity of the crisis, so utter a want of common sense, as to create a belief that he was struck with judicial blindness. It was received with mingled scorn and derision. The revolt was accomplished, and yet so quietly, that Rehoboam remained in Shechem, fancying himself the sovereign of a united kingdom, until his chief tax gatherer, who had been most imprudently sent to treat with the people, had been stoned to death. This opened his eyes, and he fled for security to Jerusalem.

 <p>
 </p><p>when all Israel heard that Jeroboam was come again--This verse closes the parenthetical narrative begun at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#002">Kg1 12:2</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#021">Kg1 12:21-24</a> resume the history from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#001">Kg1 12:1</a>. Rehoboam determined to assert his authority by leading a large force into the disaffected provinces. But the revolt of the ten tribes was completed when the prophet Shemaiah ordered, in the Lord's name, an abandonment of any hostile measures against the revolutionists. The army, overawed by the divine prohibition, dispersed, and the king was obliged to submit.

 <p>
 </p><p>built Penuel--a ruined city with a tower (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg008.htm#009">Jdg 8:9</a>), east of Jordan, on the north bank of the Jabbok. It was an object of importance to restore this fortress (as it lay on the caravan road from Gilead to Damascus and Palmyra) and to secure his frontier on that quarter.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">kg1 12:26</a></font></span></p>Jeroboam said in his heart, Now shall the kingdom return to the house of David--Having received the kingdom from God, he should have relied on the divine protection. But he did not. With a view to withdraw the people from the temple and destroy the sacred associations connected with Jerusalem, he made serious and unwarranted innovations on the religious observances of the country, on pretext of saving the people the trouble and expense of a distant journey. First, he erected two golden calves--the young bulls, Apis and Mnevis, as symbols (in the Egyptian fashion) of the true God, and the nearest, according to his fancy, to the figures of the cherubim. The one was placed at Dan, in the northern part of his kingdom; the other at Beth-el, the southern extremity, in sight of Jerusalem, and in which place he probably thought God was as likely to manifest Himself as at Jerusalem (Gen. 32:1-32; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2002.htm#002">Kg2 2:2</a>). The latter place was the most frequented--for the words (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#030">Kg1 12:30</a>) should be rendered, "the people even to Dan went to worship before the one" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer048.htm#013">Jer 48:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo004.htm#004">Amo 4:4-5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/amo005.htm#005">Amo 5:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#008">Hos 5:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#008">Hos 10:8</a>). The innovation was a sin because it was setting up the worship of God by symbols and images and departing from the place where He had chosen to put His name. Secondly, he changed the feast of tabernacles from the fifteenth of the seventh to the fifteenth of the eighth month. The ostensible reason might be, that the ingathering or harvest was later in the northern parts of the kingdom; but the real reason was to eradicate the old association with this, the most welcome and joyous festival of the year.

He himself assumed to himself the functions of the high priest, at least, at the great festival, probably from seeing the king of Egypt conjoin the royal and sacred offices, and deeming the office of the high priest too great to be vested in a subject.
