 <p>
 </p><p>Rachel envied her sister--The maternal relation confers a high degree of honor in the East, and the want of that status is felt as a stigma and deplored as a grievous calamity. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Give me children, or else I die--either be reckoned as good as dead, or pine away from vexation. The intense anxiety of Hebrew women for children arose from the hope of giving birth to the promised seed. Rachel's conduct was sinful and contrasts unfavorably with that of Rebekah (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#022">Gen 25:22</a>) and of Hannah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#011">Sa1 1:11</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">gen 30:3</a></font></span></p>Bilhah . . . Zilpah--Following the example of Sarah with regard to Hagar, an example which is not seldom imitated still, she adopted the children of her maid. Leah took the same course. A bitter and intense rivalry existed between them, all the more from their close relationship as sisters; and although they occupied separate apartments, with their families, as is the uniform custom where a plurality of wives obtains, and the husband and father spends a day with each in regular succession, that did not allay their mutual jealousies. The evil lies in the system, which being a violation of God's original ordinance, cannot yield happiness.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 30:20</a></font></span></p>And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry--The birth of a son is hailed with demonstrations of joy, and the possession of several sons confers upon the mother an honor and respectability proportioned to their number. The husband attaches a similar importance to the possession, and it forms a bond of union which renders it impossible for him ever to forsake or to be cold to a wife who has borne him sons. This explains the happy anticipations Leah founded on the possession of her six sons.

 <p>
 </p><p>when Rachel had born Joseph--Shortly after the birth of this son, Jacob's term of servitude expired, and feeling anxious to establish an independence for his family, he probably, from knowing that Esau was out of the way, announced his intention of returning to Canaan (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#014">Heb 13:14</a>). In this resolution the faith of Jacob was remarkable, for as yet he had nothing to rely on but the promise of God (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#015">Gen 28:15</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#027">Genesis 30:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">gen 30:27</a></font></span></p>Laban said . . . I have learned--His selfish uncle was averse to a separation, not from warmth of affection either for Jacob or his daughters, but from the damage his own interests would sustain. He had found, from long observation, that the blessing of heaven rested on Jacob, and that his stock had wonderfully increased under Jacob's management. This was a remarkable testimony that good men are blessings to the places where they reside. Men of the world are often blessed with temporal benefits on account of their pious relatives, though they have not always, like Laban, the wisdom to discern, or the grace to acknowledge it.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">gen 30:28</a></font></span></p>appoint me thy wages, and I will give it--The Eastern shepherds receive for their hire not money, but a certain amount of the increase or produce of the flock; but Laban would at the time have done anything to secure the continued services of his nephew, and make a show of liberality, which Jacob well knew was constrained.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#031">Genesis 30:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">gen 30:31</a></font></span></p>Jacob said, Thou shalt not give me any thing--A new agreement was made, the substance of which was, that he was to receive remuneration in the usual way, but on certain conditions which Jacob specified.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen030.htm#032">Genesis 30:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">gen 30:32</a></font></span></p>I will pass through all thy flock to-day--Eastern sheep being generally white, the goats black, and spotted or speckled ones comparatively few and rare, Jacob proposed to remove all existing ones of that description from the flock, and to be content with what might appear at the next lambing time. The proposal seemed so much in favor of Laban, that he at once agreed to it. But Jacob has been accused of taking advantage of his uncle, and though it is difficult to exculpate him from practising some degree of dissimulation, he was only availing himself of the results of his great skill and experience in the breeding of cattle. But it is evident from the next chapter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen031.htm#005">Gen 31:5-13</a>) that there was something miraculous and that the means he had employed had been suggested by a divine intimation.
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">gen 30:37</a></font></span></p>Jacob took rods, &amp;c.--There are many varieties of the hazel, some of which are more erect than the common hazel, and it was probably one of these varieties Jacob employed. The styles are of a bright red color, when peeled; and along with them he took wands of other shrubs, which, when stripped of the bark, had white streaks. These, kept constantly before the eyes of the female at the time of gestation, his observation had taught him would have an influence, through the imagination, on the future offspring.
