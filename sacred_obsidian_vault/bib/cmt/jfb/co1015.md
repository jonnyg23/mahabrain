 <p>
 </p><p>Moreover--"Now" [ALFORD and ELLICOTT]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>I declare--literally, "I make known": it implies some degree of reproach that it should be now necessary to make it known to them afresh, owing to some of them "not having the knowledge of God" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#034">Co1 15:34</a>). Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#011">Gal 1:11</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>wherein ye stand--wherein ye now take your stand. This is your present actual privilege, if ye suffer not yourselves to fall from your high standing.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#002">1 Corinthians 15:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">co1 15:2</a></font></span></p>ye are saved--rather, "ye are being saved." 
 <p>
 </p><p>if ye keep in memory what I preached unto you--Able critics, BENGEL and others, prefer connecting the words thus, "I declare unto you the Gospel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#001">Co1 15:1</a>) in what words I preached it unto you." Paul reminds them, or rather makes known to them, as if anew, not only the fact of the Gospel, but also with what words, and by what arguments, he preached it to them. Translate in that case, "if ye hold it fast." I prefer arranging as English Version, "By which ye are saved, if ye hold fast (in memory and personal appropriation) with what speech I preached it unto you." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unless--which is impossible, your faith is vain, in resting on Christ's resurrection as an objective reality.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#003">1 Corinthians 15:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">co1 15:3</a></font></span></p>I delivered unto you--A short creed, or summary of articles of faith, was probably even then existing; and a profession in accordance with it was required of candidates for baptism (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act008.htm#037">Act 8:37</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>first of all--literally, "among the foremost points" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#002">Heb 6:2</a>). The atonement is, in Paul's view, of primary importance. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>which I . . . received--from Christ Himself by special revelation (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1011.htm#023">Co1 11:23</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>died for our sins--that is, to atone FOR them; for taking away our sins (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#005">Jo1 3:5</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#004">Gal 1:4</a>): "gave Himself for our sins" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#005">Isa 53:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#015">Co2 5:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit002.htm#014">Tit 2:14</a>). The "for" here does not, as in some passages, imply vicarious substitution, but "in behalf of" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb005.htm#003">Heb 5:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024">Pe1 2:24</a>). It does not, however, mean merely "on account of," which is expressed by a different Greek word (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025">Rom 4:25</a>), (though in English Version translated similarly, "for"). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>according to the scriptures--which "cannot be broken." Paul puts the testimony of Scripture above that of those who saw the Lord after His resurrection [BENGEL]. So our Lord quotes <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#012">Isa 53:12</a>, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#037">Luk 22:37</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa022.htm#015">Psa 22:15</a>, &amp;c.; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan009.htm#026">Dan 9:26</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">co1 15:4</a></font></span></p>buried . . . rose again--His burial is more closely connected with His resurrection than His death. At the moment of His death, the power of His inextinguishable life exerted itself (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#052">Mat 27:52</a>). The grave was to Him not the destined receptacle of corruption, but an apartment fitted for entering into life (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#026">Act 2:26-28</a>) [BENGEL]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>rose again--Greek, "hath risen": the state thus begun, and its consequences, still continue.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005">1 Corinthians 15:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">co1 15:5</a></font></span></p>seen of Cephas--Peter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#034">Luk 24:34</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>the twelve--The round number for "the Eleven" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#033">Luk 24:33</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#036">Luk 24:36</a>). "The Twelve" was their ordinary appellation, even when their number was not full. However, very possibly Matthias was present (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022">Act 1:22-23</a>). Some of the oldest manuscripts and versions read, "the Eleven": but the best on the whole, "the Twelve."
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#006">1 Corinthians 15:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">co1 15:6</a></font></span></p>five hundred--This appearance was probably on the mountain (Tabor, according to tradition), in Galilee, when His most solemn and public appearance, according to His special promise, was vouchsafed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#032">Mat 26:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#007">Mat 28:7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#010">Mat 28:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat028.htm#016">Mat 28:16</a>). He "appointed" this place, as one remote from Jerusalem, so that believers might assemble there more freely and securely. ALFORD'S theory of Jerusalem being the scene, is improbable; as such a multitude of believers could not, with any safety, have met in one place in the metropolis, after His crucifixion there. The number of disciples (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#015">Act 1:15</a>) at Jerusalem shortly after, was one hundred and twenty, those in Galilee and elsewhere not being reckoned. Andronicus and JUNIUS were, perhaps, of the number (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#007">Rom 16:7</a>): they are said to be "among the apostles" (who all were witnesses of the resurrection, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022">Act 1:22</a>). 
 <p>
 </p><p>remain unto this present--and, therefore, may be sifted thoroughly to ascertain the trustworthiness of their testimony. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>fallen asleep--in the sure hope of awaking at the resurrection (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act007.htm#060">Act 7:60</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007">1 Corinthians 15:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">co1 15:7</a></font></span></p>seen of James--the Less, the brother of our Lord (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#019">Gal 1:19</a>). The Gospel according to the Hebrews, quoted by JEROME [On Illustrious Men, p. 170 D.], records that "James swore he would not eat bread from the hour that he drank the cup of the Lord, till he should see Him rising again from the dead." 
 <p>
 </p><p>all the apostles--The term here includes many others besides "the Twelve" already enumerated (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005">Co1 15:5</a>): perhaps the seventy disciples (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#001">Luk 10:1</a>) [CHRYSOSTOM].
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#008">1 Corinthians 15:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">co1 15:8</a></font></span></p>One born out of due time--Greek, "the one abortively born": the abortion in the family of the apostles. As a child born before the due time is puny, and though born alive, yet not of the proper size, and scarcely worthy of the name of man, so "I am the least of the apostles," scarcely "meet to be called an apostle"; a supernumerary taken into the college of apostles out of regular course, not led to Christ by long instruction, like a natural birth, but by a sudden power, as those prematurely born [GROTIUS]. Compare the similar image from childbirth, and by the same spiritual power, the resurrection of Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003">Pe1 1:3</a>). "Begotten again by the resurrection of Jesus." Jesus' appearance to Paul, on the way to Damascus, is the one here referred to.
 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#009">1 Corinthians 15:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">co1 15:9</a></font></span></p>least--The name, "Paulus," in Latin, means "least." 
 <p>
 </p><p>I persecuted the church--Though God has forgiven him, Paul can hardly forgive himself at the remembrance of his past sin.
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#010">1 Corinthians 15:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">co1 15:10</a></font></span></p>by . . . grace . . . and his grace--The repetition implies the prominence which God's grace had in his mind, as the sole cause of his marvellous conversion and subsequent labors. Though "not meet to be called an apostle," grace has given him, in Christ, the meetness needed for the office. Translate as the Greek, "His grace which was (showed) towards me." 
 <p>
 </p><p>what I am--occupying the honorable office of an apostle. Contrast with this the self-sufficient prayer of another Pharisee (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#011">Luk 18:11</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>but I laboured--by God's grace (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#016">Phi 2:16</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>than they all--than any of the apostles (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#007">Co1 15:7</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>grace of God . . . with me--Compare "the Lord working with them" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar016.htm#020">Mar 16:20</a>). The oldest manuscripts omit "which was." The "not I, but grace," implies, that though the human will concurred with God when brought by His Spirit into conformity with His will, yet "grace" so preponderated in the work, that his own co-operation is regarded as nothing, and grace as virtually the sole agent. (Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1003.htm#009">Co1 3:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#020">Mat 10:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2006.htm#001">Co2 6:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#012">Phi 2:12-13</a>).

 <p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#012">1 Corinthians 15:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">co1 15:12</a></font></span></p>if--Seeing that it is an admitted fact that Christ is announced by us eye-witnesses as having risen from the dead, how is it that some of you deny that which is a necessary consequence of Christ's resurrection, namely, the general resurrection? 
 <p>
 </p><p>some--Gentile reasoners (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act017.htm#032">Act 17:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#008">Act 26:8</a>) who would not believe it because they did not see "how" it could be (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#035">Co1 15:35-36</a>).
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#013">1 Corinthians 15:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">co1 15:13</a></font></span></p>If there be no general resurrection, which is the consequent, then there can have been no resurrection of Christ, which is the antecedent. The head and the members of the body stand on the same footing: what does not hold good of them, does not hold good of Him either: His resurrection and theirs are inseparably joined (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#020">Co1 15:20-22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#019">Joh 14:19</a>).
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">co1 15:14</a></font></span></p>your faith . . . vain-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#011">Co1 15:11</a>). The Greek for "vain" here is, empty, unreal: in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#017">Co1 15:17</a>, on the other hand, it is, without use, frustrated. The principal argument of the first preachers in support of Christianity was that God had raised Christ from the dead (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act001.htm#022">Act 1:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act002.htm#032">Act 2:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#010">Act 4:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act004.htm#033">Act 4:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#037">Act 13:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#004">Rom 1:4</a>). If this fact were false, the faith built on it must be false too.
 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">co1 15:15</a></font></span></p>testified of God--that is, concerning God. The rendering of others is, "against God" [Vulgate, ESTIUS, GROTIUS]: the Greek preposition with the genitive implies, not direct antagonism (as the accusative would mean), but indirect to the dishonor of God. English Version is probably better. 
 <p>
 </p><p>if so be--as they assert. It is not right to tell untrue stories, though they are told and seem for the glory of God (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/job013.htm#007">Job 13:7</a>).
 </p><p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">co1 15:17</a></font></span></p>vain--Ye are, by the very fact (supposing the case to be as the skeptics maintained), frustrated of all which "your faith" appropriates: Ye are still under the everlasting condemnation of your sins (even in the disembodied state which is here referred to), from which Christ's resurrection is our justification (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#025">Rom 4:25</a>): "saved by his life" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#010">Rom 5:10</a>).

"In Christ's case the term used is death, to assure us of the reality of His suffering; in our case, sleep, to give us consolation: In His case, His resurrection having actually taken place, Paul shrinks not from the term death; in ours, the resurrection being still only a matter of hope, he uses the term falling asleep" [PHOTIUS, QuÃ&amp;brvbr;stiones AmphilochiÃ&amp;brvbr;, 197].

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">co1 15:19</a></font></span></p>If our hopes in Christ were limited to this life only, we should be, of all men, most to be pitied; namely, because, while others live unmolested, we are exposed to every trial and persecution, and, after all, are doomed to bitter disappointment in our most cherished hope; for all our hope of salvation, even of the soul (not merely of the body), hangs on the resurrection of Christ, without which His death would be of no avail to us (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#019">Eph 1:19-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003">Pe1 1:3</a>).

We should be even worse, for we should be also without present enjoyment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009">Co1 4:9</a>).

 </p><p>the first-fruits--the earnest or pledge, that the whole resurrection harvest will follow, so that our faith is not vain, nor our hope limited to this life. The time of writing this Epistle was probably about the Passover (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1005.htm#007">Co1 5:7</a>); the day after the Passover sabbath was that for offering the first-fruits (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev023.htm#010">Lev 23:10-11</a>), and the same was the day of Christ's resurrection: whence appears the appropriateness of the image.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">co1 15:23</a></font></span></p>But every man in his own order--rather, "rank": the Greek is not in the abstract, but concrete: image from troops, "each in his own regiment." Though all shall rise again, let not any think all shall be saved; nay, each shall have his proper place, Christ first (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#018">Col 1:18</a>), and after Him the godly who die in Christ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1004.htm#016">Th1 4:16</a>), in a separate band from the ungodly, and then "the end," that is, the resurrection of the rest of the dead. Christian churches, ministers, and individuals seem about to be judged first "at His coming" (Mat. 25:1-30); then "all the nations" (Mat. 25:31-46). Christ's own flock shall share His glory "at His coming," which is not to be confounded with "the end," or general judgment (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#004">Rev 20:4-6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev020.htm#011">Rev 20:11-15</a>). The latter is not in this chapter specially discussed, but only the first resurrection, namely, that of the saints: not even the judgment of Christian hollow professors (Mat. 25:1-30) at His coming, is handled, but only the glory of them "that are Christ's," who alone in the highest sense "obtain the resurrection from the dead" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#014">Luk 14:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk020.htm#035">Luk 20:35-36</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011">Phi 3:11</a>; see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#011">Phi 3:11</a>). The second coming of Christ is not a mere point of time, but a period beginning with the resurrection of the just at His appearing, and ending with the general judgment. The ground of the universal resurrection is the union of all mankind in nature with Christ, their representative Head, who has done away with death, by His own death in their stead: the ground of the resurrection of believers is not merely this, but their personal union with Him as their "Life" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#004">Col 3:4</a>), effected causatively by the Holy Spirit, and instrumentally by faith as the subjective, and by ordinances as the objective means.

Seeming at variance with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan007.htm#014">Dan 7:14</a>, "His dominion is an everlasting dominion which shall not pass away." Really, His giving up of the mediatorial kingdom to the Father, when the end for which the mediatorial economy was established has been accomplished, is altogether in harmony with its continuing everlastingly. The change which shall then take place, shall be in the manner of administration, not in the kingdom itself; God shall then come into direct connection with the earth, instead of mediatorially, when Christ shall have fully and finally removed everything that severs asunder the holy God and a sinful earth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#020">Col 1:20</a>). The glory of God is the final end of Christ's mediatorial office (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi002.htm#010">Phi 2:10-11</a>). His co-equality with the Father is independent of the latter, and prior to it, and shall, therefore, continue when its function shall have ceased. His manhood, too, shall everlastingly continue, though, as now, subordinate to the Father. The throne of the Lamb (but no longer mediatorial) as well as of God, shall be in the heavenly city (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#003">Rev 22:3</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev003.htm#021">Rev 3:21</a>). The unity of the Godhead, and the unity of the Church, shall be simultaneously manifested at Christ's second coming. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zep003.htm#009">Zep 3:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac014.htm#009">Zac 14:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh017.htm#021">Joh 17:21-24</a>. The oldest manuscripts for "shall have delivered up," read, "delivereth up," which suits the sense better. It is "when He shall have put down all rule," that "He delivereth up the kingdom to the Father." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>shall have put down all rule--the effect produced during the millennary reign of Himself and His saints (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#001">Psa 110:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa008.htm#006">Psa 8:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa002.htm#006">Psa 2:6-9</a>), to which passages Paul refers, resting his argument on the two words, "all" and "until," of the Psalmist: a proof of verbal inspiration of Scripture (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev002.htm#026">Rev 2:26-27</a>). Meanwhile, He "rules in the midst of His enemies" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa110.htm#002">Psa 110:2</a>). He is styled "the King" when He takes His great power (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034">Mat 25:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#015">Rev 11:15</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev011.htm#017">Rev 11:17</a>). The Greek for "put down" is, "done away with," or "brought to naught." "All" must be subject to Him, whether openly opposed powers, as Satan and his angels, or kings and angelic principalities (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph001.htm#021">Eph 1:21</a>).

ALFORD thinks there is an allusion to a practice at Corinth of baptizing a living person in behalf of a friend who died unbaptized; thus Paul, without giving the least sanction to the practice, uses an ad hominem argument from it against its practicers, some of whom, though using it, denied the resurrection: "What account can they give of their practice; why are they at the trouble of it, if the dead rise not?" [So Jesus used an ad hominem argument, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#027">Mat 12:27</a>]. But if so, it is strange there is no direct censure of it. Some Marcionites adopted the practice at a later period, probably from taking this passage, as ALFORD does; but, generally, it was unknown in the Church. BENGEL translates, "over (immediately upon) the dead," that is, who will be gathered to the dead immediately after baptism. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job017.htm#001">Job 17:1</a>, "the graves are ready for me." The price they get for their trouble is, that they should be gathered to the dead for ever (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#013">Co1 15:13</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#016">Co1 15:16</a>). Many in the ancient Church put off baptism till near death. This seems the better view; though there may have been some rites of symbolical baptism at Corinth, now unknown, perhaps grounded on Jesus' words (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#022">Mat 20:22-23</a>), which Paul here alludes to. The best punctuation is, "If the dead rise not at all, why are they then baptized for them" (so the oldest manuscripts read the last words, instead of "for the dead")?

If "merely as a man" (with the mere human hope of the present life; not with the Christian's hope of the resurrection; answering to "If the dead rise not," the parallel clause in the next sentence), I have fought with men resembling savage beasts. Heraclitus, of Ephesus, had termed his countrymen "wild beasts" four hundred years before. So Epimenides called the Cretians (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/tit001.htm#012">Tit 1:12</a>). Paul was still at Ephesus (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#008">Co1 16:8</a>), and there his life was daily in danger (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#009">Co1 4:9</a>; compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2001.htm#008">Co2 1:8</a>). Though the tumult (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029">Act 19:29-30</a>) had not yet taken place (for after it he set out immediately for Macedonia), this Epistle was written evidently just before it, when the storm was gathering; "many adversaries" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1016.htm#009">Co1 16:9</a>) were already menacing him. 
 <p>
 </p><p>what advantageth it me?--seeing I have renounced all that, "as a mere man," might compensate me for such sufferings, gain, fame, &amp;c.

 </p><p>let us eat, &amp;c.--Quoted from the Septuagint, (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa022.htm#013">Isa 22:13</a>), where the prophet describes the reckless self-indulgence of the despisers of God's call to mourning, Let us enjoy the good things of life now, for it soon will end. Paul imitates the language of such skeptics, to reprove both their theory and practice. "If men but persuade themselves that they shall die like the beasts, they soon will live like beasts too" [SOUTH].

How then can they rise again? If it be a different body, how can the personal identity be preserved? Paul answers, In one sense it will be the same body, in another, a distinct body. It will be a body, but a spiritual, not a natural, body.

He converts the very objection (the death of the natural body) into an argument. Death, so far from preventing quickening, is the necessary prelude and prognostication of it, just as the seed "is not quickened" into a new sprout with increased produce, "except it die" (except a dissolution of its previous organization takes place). Christ by His death for us has not given us a reprieve from death as to the life which we have from Adam; nay, He permits the law to take its course on our fleshly nature; but He brings from Himself new spiritual and heavenly life out of death (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#037">Co1 15:37</a>).

No longer without stalk or ear, but clothed with blade and ears, and yielding many grains instead of only one [GROTIUS]. There is not an identity of all the particles of the old and the new body. For the perpetual transmutation of matter is inconsistent with this. But there is a hidden germ which constitutes the identity of body amidst all outward changes: the outward accretions fall off in its development, while the germ remains the same. Every such germ ("seed," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#038">Co1 15:38</a>) "shall have its own body," and be instantly recognized, just as each plant now is known from the seed that was sown (see on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#013">Co1 6:13</a>). So Christ by the same image illustrated the truth that His death was the necessary prelude of His putting on His glorified body, which is the ground of the regeneration of the many who believe (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh012.htm#024">Joh 12:24</a>). Progress is the law of the spiritual, as of the natural world. Death is the avenue not to mere revivification or reanimation, but to resurrection and regeneration (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#028">Mat 19:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021">Phi 3:21</a>).

But <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#050">Co1 15:50</a> below implies, it is not "flesh and blood" in the animal sense we now understand them; for these "shall not inherit the kingdom of God."

The Holy Spirit in the spirit of believers, indeed, is an earnest of a superior state (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom008.htm#011">Rom 8:11</a>), but meanwhile in the body the animal soul preponderates; hereafter the Spirit shall predominate, and the animal soul be duly subordinate.

 </p><p>it is written-- (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen002.htm#007">Gen 2:7</a>); "Man became (was made to become) a living soul," that is, endowed with an animal soul, the living principle of his body.

As the natural or animal-souled body (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044">Co1 15:44</a>) is the fruit of our union with the first Adam, an animal-souled man, so the spiritual body is the fruit of our union with the second Adam, who is the quickening Spirit (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017">Co2 3:17</a>). As He became representative of the whole of humanity in His union of the two natures, He exhausted in His own person the sentence of death passed on all men, and giveth spiritual and everlasting life to whom He will.

His soul had the germ of the Spirit, rather than the fulness of it, such as man shall have when restored "body, soul, and spirit," by the second Adam (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#023">Th1 5:23</a>). As the first and lower Adam came before the second and heavenly Adam, so the animal-souled body comes first, and must die before it be changed into the spiritual body (that is, that in which the Spirit predominates over the animal soul).

"Flesh and blood" of the same animal and corruptible nature as our present (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#044">Co1 15:44</a>) animal-souled bodies, cannot inherit the kingdom of God. Therefore the believer acquiesces gladly in the unrepealed sentence of the holy law, which appoints the death of the present body as the necessary preliminary to the resurrection body of glory. Hence he "dies daily" to the flesh and to the world, as the necessary condition to his regeneration here and hereafter (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#006">Joh 3:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal002.htm#020">Gal 2:20</a>).

The resurrection body will be still a body though spiritual, and substantially retaining the personal identity; as is proved by <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#039">Luk 24:39</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh020.htm#027">Joh 20:27</a>, compared with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi003.htm#021">Phi 3:21</a>.

English Version is supported by some of the oldest manuscripts and Fathers. The Greek is literally "We all shall not sleep, but," &amp;c. The putting off of the corruptible body for an incorruptible by an instantaneous change will, in the case of "the quick," stand as equivalent to death, appointed to all men (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb009.htm#027">Heb 9:27</a>); of this Enoch and Elijah are types and forerunners. The "we" implies that Christians in that age and every successive age since and hereafter were designed to stand waiting, as if Christ might come again in their time, and as if they might be found among "the quick."

The Hebrew may be translated, "O death, where are thy plagues? Where, O Hades, is thy destruction?" The Septuagint, "Where is thy victory (literally, in a lawsuit), O death? Where is thy sting, O Hades? . . . Sting" answers to the Hebrew "plagues," namely, a poisoned sting causing plagues. Appropriate, as to the old serpent (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen003.htm#014">Gen 3:14-15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#006">Num 21:6</a>). "Victory" answers to the Hebrew "destruction." Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa025.htm#007">Isa 25:7</a>, "destroy . . . veil . . . over all nations," namely, victoriously destroy it; and to "in victory" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#054">Co1 15:54</a>), which he triumphantly repeats. The "where" implies their past victorious destroying power and sting, now gone for ever; obtained through Satan's triumph over man in Eden, which enlisted God's law on the side of Satan and death against man (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#012">Rom 5:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#017">Rom 5:17</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom005.htm#021">Rom 5:21</a>).
