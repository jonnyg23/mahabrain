Fausset and David Brown [1882] at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001">Luke Chapter 2</a></h3>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">luk 2:1</a></font></span></p>BIRTH OF CHRIST. (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001">Luk 2:1-7</a>)

That there was a taxing, however, of the whole Roman Empire under Augustus, is now admitted by all; and candid critics, even of skeptical tendency, are ready to allow that there is not likely to be any real inaccuracy in the statement of our Evangelist. Many superior scholars would render the words thus, "This registration was previous to Cyrenius being governor of Syria"--as the word "first" is rendered in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#015">Joh 1:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh015.htm#018">Joh 15:18</a>. In this case, of course, the difficulty vanishes. But it is perhaps better to suppose, with others, that the registration may have been ordered with a view to the taxation, about the time of our Lord's birth, though the taxing itself--an obnoxious measure in Palestine--was not carried out till the time of Quirinus.

A little longer stay at Nazareth, and the prophecy would have failed. But lo! with no intention certainly on her part, much less of CÃ&amp;brvbr;sar Augustus, to fulfil the prophecy, she is brought from Nazareth to Bethlehem, and at that nick of time her period arrives, and her Babe is born (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#023">Psa 118:23</a>). "Every creature walks blindfold; only He that dwells in light knows whether they go" [BISHOP HALL].

 </p><p>wrapt him . . . laid him--The mother herself did so. Had she then none to help her? It would seem so (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009">Co2 8:9</a>). 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>a manger--the manger, the bench to which the horses' heads were tied, on which their food could rest [WEBSTER and WILKINSON]. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>no room in the inn--a square erection, open inside, where travellers put up, and whose rear parts were used as stables. The ancient tradition, that our Lord was born in a grotto or cave, is quite consistent with this, the country being rocky. In Mary's condition the journey would be a slow one, and ere they arrived, the inn would be fully occupied--affecting anticipation of the reception He was throughout to meet with (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#011">Joh 1:11</a>).
 </p><p>

 </p><p>

 </p><p>But some "guests went and came" not "rudely," but reverently. God sent visitors of His own to pay court to the new-born King.

 <p>
 </p><p>abiding in the fields--staying there, probably in huts or tents. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>watch . . . by night--or, night watches, taking their turn of watching. From about passover time in April until autumn, the flocks pastured constantly in the open fields, the shepherds lodging there all that time. (From this it seems plain that the period of the year usually assigned to our Lord's birth is too late). Were these shepherds chosen to have the first sight of the blessed Babe without any respect of their own state of mind? That, at least, is not God's way. "No doubt, like Simeon (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#025">Luk 2:25</a>), they were among the waiters for the Consolation of Israel" [OLSHAUSEN]; and, if the simplicity of their rustic minds, their quiet occupation, the stillness of the midnight hours, and the amplitude of the deep blue vault above them for the heavenly music which was to fill their ear, pointed them out as fit recipients for the first tidings of an Infant Saviour, the congenial meditations and conversations by which, we may suppose, they would beguile the tedious hours would perfect their preparation for the unexpected visit. Thus was Nathanael engaged, all alone but not unseen, under the fig tree, in unconscious preparation for his first interview with Jesus. (See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#048">Joh 1:48</a>). So was the rapt seer on his lonely rock "in the spirit on the Lord's Day," little thinking that this was his preparation for hearing behind him the trumpet voice of the Son of man (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#010">Rev 1:10</a>, &amp;c.). But if the shepherds in His immediate neighborhood had the first, the sages from afar had the next sight of the new-born King. Even so still, simplicity first, science next, finds its way to Christ, whom
 </p><p>
 </p><p>In quiet ever and in shade 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Shepherds and Sage may find-- 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>They, who have bowed untaught to Nature's sway, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>And they, who follow Truth along her star-pav'd way. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>KEBLE 
 </p><p> 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#009">Luke 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">luk 2:9</a></font></span></p>glory of the Lord--"the brightness or glory which is represented as encompassing all heavenly visions" [OLSHAUSEN]. 
 <p>
 </p><p>sore afraid--So it ever was (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/dan010.htm#007">Dan 10:7-8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#012">Luk 1:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#017">Rev 1:17</a>). Men have never felt easy with the invisible world laid suddenly open to their gaze. It was never meant to be permanent; a momentary purpose was all it was intended to serve.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">luk 2:10</a></font></span></p>to all people--"to the whole people," that is, of Israel; to be by them afterwards opened up to the whole world. (See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#014">Luk 2:14</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">luk 2:11</a></font></span></p>unto you is born--you shepherds, Israel, mankind [BENGEL]. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</a>, "Unto us a Child is born." It is a birth--"The Word is made flesh" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a>). When? "This day." Where? "In the city of David"--in the right line and at the right "spot"; where prophecy bade us look for Him, and faith accordingly expected Him. How dear to us should be these historic moorings of our faith! With the loss of them, all substantial Christianity is lost. By means of them how many have been kept from making shipwreck, and attained to a certain external admiration of Him, ere yet they have fully "beheld His glory." 
 <p>
 </p><p>a Saviour--not One who shall be a Saviour, but "born a Saviour." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Christ the Lord--"magnificent appellation!" [BENGEL]. "This is the only place where these words come together; and I see no way of understanding this "Lord" but as corresponding to the Hebrew JEHOVAH" [ALFORD].

 <p>
 </p><p>the babe--"a Babe." 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>a manger--"the manger." The sign was to consist, it seems, solely in the overpowering contrast between the things just said of Him and the lowly condition in which they would find Him--Him whose goings forth have been from of old, from everlasting, "ye shall find a Babe"; whom the heaven of heavens cannot contain, "wrapt in swaddling bands"; the "Saviour, Christ the Lord," lying in a manger! Thus early were these amazing contrasts, which are His chosen style, held forth. (See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009">Co2 8:9</a>.)

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">luk 2:14</a></font></span></p>Glory, &amp;c.--brief but transporting hymn--not only in articulate human speech, for our benefit, but in tunable measure, in the form of a Hebrew parallelism of two complete clauses, and a third one only amplifying the second, and so without a connecting "and." The "glory to God," which the new-born "Saviour" was to bring, is the first note of this sublime hymn: to this answers, in the second clause, the "peace on earth," of which He was to be "the Prince" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#006">Isa 9:6</a>) --probably sung responsively by the celestial choir; while quickly follows the glad echo of this note, probably by a third detachment of the angelic choristers--"good will to men." "They say not, glory to God in heaven, where angels are, but, using a rare expression, "in the highest [heavens]," whither angels aspire not," (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb001.htm#003">Heb 1:3-4</a>) [BENGEL]. "Peace" with God is the grand necessity of a fallen world. To bring in this, and all other peace in its train, was the prime errand of the Saviour to this earth, and, along with it, Heaven's whole "good will to men"--the divine complacency on a new footing--descends to rest upon men, as upon the Son Himself, in whom God is "well-pleased." (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</a>, the same word as here.)
 <p>

They are not taken up with the angels, the glory that invested them, and the lofty strains with which they filled the air. Nor do they say, Let us go and see if this be true--they have no misgivings. But "Let us go and see this thing which is come to pass, which the Lord hath made known unto us." Does not this confirm the view given on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#008">Luk 2:8</a> of the spirit of these humble men?

 <p>
 </p><p>her purification--Though the most and best copies read "their," it was the mother only who needed purifying from the legal uncleanness of childbearing. "The days" of this purification for a male child were forty in all (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#002">Lev 12:2</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#004">Lev 12:4</a>), on the expiry of which the mother was required to offer a lamb for a burnt offering, and a turtle dove or a young pigeon for a sin offering. If she could not afford a lamb, the mother had to bring another turtle dove or young pigeon; and, if even this was beyond her means, then a portion of fine flour, but without the usual fragrant accompaniments of oil and frankincense, as it represented a sin offering (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev012.htm#006">Lev 12:6-8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#007">Lev 5:7-11</a>). From the intermediate offering of "a pair of turtle doves or two young pigeons," we gather that Joseph and the Virgin were in poor circumstances (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2008.htm#009">Co2 8:9</a>), though not in abject poverty. Being a first-born male, they "bring him to Jerusalem, to present him to the Lord." All such had been claimed as "holy to the Lord," or set apart to sacred uses, in memory of the deliverance of the first-born of Israel from destruction in Egypt, through the sprinkling of blood (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo013.htm#002">Exo 13:2</a>). In lieu of these, however, one whole tribe, that of Levi, was accepted, and set apart to occupations exclusively sacred (Num. 3:11-38); and whereas there were two hundred seventy-three fewer Levites than first-born of all Israel on the first reckoning, each of these first-born was to be redeemed by the payment of five shekels, yet not without being "presented (or brought) unto the Lord," in token of His rightful claim to them and their service (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/num003.htm#044">Num 3:44-47</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#015">Num 18:15-16</a>). It was in obedience to this "law of Moses," that the Virgin presented her babe unto the Lord, "in the east gate of the court called Nicanor's Gate, where she herself would be sprinkled by the priest with the blood of her sacrifice" [LIGHTFOOT]. By that Babe, in due time, we were to be redeemed, "not with corruptible things as silver and gold, but with the precious blood of Christ" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#018">Pe1 1:18-19</a>), and the consuming of the mother's burnt offering, and the sprinkling of her with the blood of her sin offering, were to find their abiding realization in the "living sacrifice" of the Christian mother herself, in the fulness of a "heart sprinkled from an evil conscience," by "the blood which cleanseth from all sin."

In another view it was prior faith rewarded by present sight.

 </p><p>fall and rising again of many in Israel, and for a sign spoken against--Perhaps the former of these phrases expresses the two stages of temporary "fall of many in Israel" through unbelief, during our Lord's earthly career, and the subsequent "rising again" of the same persons after the effusion of the Spirit at pentecost threw a new light to them on the whole subject; while the latter clause describes the determined enemies of the Lord Jesus. Such opposite views of Christ are taken from age to age.

 <p>
 </p><p>went up--"were wont to go." Though males only were required to go up to Jerusalem at the three annual festivals (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo023.htm#014">Exo 23:14-17</a>), devout women, when family duties permitted, went also, as did Hannah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1001.htm#007">Sa1 1:7</a>), and, as we here see, the mother of Jesus. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>when twelve years old--At this age every Jewish boy was styled "a son of the law," being put under a course of instruction and trained to fasting and attendance on public worship, besides being set to learn a trade. At this age accordingly our Lord is taken up for the first time to Jerusalem, at the passover season, the chief of the three annual festivals. But oh, with what thoughts and feelings must this Youth have gone up! Long ere He beheld it, He had doubtless "loved the habitation of God's house and the place where His honor dwelt" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa026.htm#008">Psa 26:8</a>), a love nourished, we may be sure, by that "word hid in His heart," with which in afterlife He showed so perfect a familiarity. As the time for His first visit approached, could one's ear have caught the breathings of His young soul, he might have heard Him whispering, "As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after Thee, O God. The Lord loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob. I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go unto the house of the Lord. Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem!" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001">Psa 42:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#002">Psa 87:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa122.htm#001">Psa 122:1-2</a>). On catching the first view of "the city of their solemnities," and high above all in it, "the place of God's rest," we hear Him saying to Himself, "Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King: Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God doth shine" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#002">Psa 48:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa050.htm#002">Psa 50:2</a>). Of His feelings or actions during all the eight days of the feast not a word is said. As a devout child, in company with its parents, He would go through the services, keeping His thoughts to Himself. But methinks I hear Him, after the sublime services of that feast, saying to Himself, "He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me was love. I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#003">Sol 2:3-4</a>).

 <p>

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">luk 2:45</a></font></span></p>After three sorrowing days, they find Him still in Jerusalem, not gazing on its architecture, or surveying its forms of busy life, but in the temple--not the "sanctuary" (as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk001.htm#009">Luk 1:9</a>), to which only the priests had access, but in some one of the enclosures around it, where the rabbins, or "doctors," taught their scholars.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_046">luk 2:46</a></font></span></p>hearing . . . asking--The method of question and answer was the customary form of rabbinical teaching; teacher and learner becoming by turns questioner and answerer, as may be seen from their extant works. This would give full scope for all that "astonished them in His understanding and answers." Not that He assumed the office of teaching--"His hour" for that "was not yet come," and His equipment for that was not complete; for He had yet to "increase in wisdom" as well as "stature" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#052">Luk 2:52</a>). In fact, the beauty of Christ's example lies very much in His never at one stage of His life anticipating the duties of another. All would be in the style and manner of a learner, "opening His mouth and panting." "His soul breaking for the longing that it had unto God's judgments at all times" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#020">Psa 119:20</a>), and now more than ever before, when finding Himself for the first time in His Father's house. Still there would be in His questions far more than in their answers; and if we may take the frivolous interrogatories with which they afterwards plied Him, about the woman that had seven husbands and such like, as a specimen of their present drivelling questions, perhaps we shall not greatly err, if we suppose that "the questions" which He now "asked them" in return were just the germs of those pregnant questions with which He astonished and silenced them in after years: "What think ye of Christ? Whose Son is He? If David call Him Lord, how is He then his Son?" "Which is the first and great commandment?" "Who is my neighbour?"

This latter shade of meaning, which includes the former, is perhaps the true one, Here He felt Himself at home, breathing His own proper air. His words convey a gentle rebuke of their obtuseness in requiring Him to explain this. "Once here, thought ye I should so readily hasten away? Let ordinary worshippers be content to keep the feast and be gone; but is this all ye have learnt of Me?" Methinks we are here let into the holy privacies of Nazareth; for what He says they should have known, He must have given them ground to know. She tells Him of the sorrow with which His father and she had sought Him. He speaks of no Father but one, saying, in effect, My Father has not been seeking Me; I have been with Him all this time; "the King hath brought me into His chambers . . . His left hand is under my head, and His right hand doth embrace me" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol001.htm#004">Sol 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sol002.htm#006">Sol 2:6</a>).

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_050">luk 2:50</a></font></span></p>understood not--probably He had never expressly said as much, and so confounded them, though it was but the true interpretation of many things which they had seen and heard from Him at home. (See on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#004">Joh 14:4</a>.) But lest it should be thought that now He threw off the filial yoke, and became His own Master henceforth, and theirs too, it is purposely added, "And He went down with them, and was subject unto them." The marvel of this condescension lies in its coming after such a scene, and such an assertion of His higher Sonship; and the words are evidently meant to convey this. "From this time we have no more mention of Joseph. The next we hear is of his "mother and brethren" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh002.htm#012">Joh 2:12</a>); whence it is inferred, that between this time and the commencement of our Lord's public life, Joseph died" [ALFORD], having now served the double end of being the protector of our Lord's Virgin--mother, and affording Himself the opportunity of presenting a matchless pattern of subjection to both parents.

What seasons of tranquil meditation over the lively oracles, and holy fellowship with His Father; what inlettings, on the one hand, of light, and love, and power from on high, and outgoings of filial supplication, freedom, love, and joy on the other, would these eighteen years contain! And would they not seem "but a few days" if they were so passed, however ardently He might long to be more directly "about His Father's business?"
