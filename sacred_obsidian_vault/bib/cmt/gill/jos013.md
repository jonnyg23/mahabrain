 <p>
 </p><p>In this chapter Joshua is informed by the Lord, or put in mind, that part of the land of Canaan remained unconquered, and which it was; and is directed to divide the whole land among the nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001">Jos 13:1</a>; and since the two tribes of Reuben and Gad, and the other half tribe of Manasseh, had received their inheritance on the other side Jordan, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008">Jos 13:8</a>; that is described in general, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009">Jos 13:9</a>; and, then the particular portion of Reuben, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015">Jos 13:15</a>; and of Gad, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#024">Jos 13:24</a>; and of the half tribe of Manasseh, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#029">Jos 13:29</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#001">Joshua 13:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">jos 13:1</a></font></span></p>Now Joshua was old, and stricken in years,.... How old he was cannot be said precisely, but it is very probable he was now about an hundred years of age, for he lived to be an hundred ten; and the land of Canaan was seven years in dividing, as the Jews generally say, and it seems as if he did not live long after that: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the Lord said unto him: either spoke to him out of the tabernacle, or appeared to him in a dream or vision: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>thou art old, and stricken in years, and there remaineth yet very much land to be possessed: that is, very much of the land of Canaan, which God had promised to Abraham, yet remained unconquered by Joshua, and unpossessed by the children of Israel; and the old age of Joshua is observed, to intimate to him that through it, and the infirmities of it, he was unable to go out to war, and to finish this work, which must be left to be done by others hereafter; and that he should with all expedition set about another work he was capable of doing, before he died, which was the division of the land among the tribes of Israel. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#002">Joshua 13:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">jos 13:2</a></font></span></p>This is the land that yet remaineth,.... Unconquered and not enjoyed, namely, what is after described; and this account is given for Joshua's information, that he might know what to divide, and for the people of Israel's sake, that they might know what they had a right to a claim upon; what they should endeavour to possess themselves of, and what the Lord would deliver into their hands, provided they were obedient to his will, for, because they were not, hence many of these places never came into their possession, though divided to them by lot: 
 <p>
 </p><p>all the borders of the Philistines; whose country bordered and lay upon the shores of the Mediterranean sea, in the southwest of the land of Canaan: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all Geshuri; the principal city belonging to it is said to be in Syria, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2015.htm#008">Sa2 15:8</a>; and had a king over it in the times of David, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003">Sa2 3:3</a>; and seems never to have come into the hands of the Israelites. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#003">Joshua 13:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">jos 13:3</a></font></span></p>From Sihor, which is before Egypt,.... Which Jarchi and Kimchi interpret of the river Nile, and so that river is called, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#018">Jer 2:18</a>; it seems to have this name from the waters of it being black and turbid; and hence it was called by the Greeks "Melas"; and by the Latins "Melo"; though it is thought, that not properly the river itself is here meant, which did not reach to the borders of Palestine, but a branch of it, a rivulet from it, for so a traveller (a) writes,"in a journey of about five days from Gaza towards Egypt, the hithermost arm of the Nile is received by the sea, and is commonly called Carabus?" 
 <p>
 </p><p>even unto the borders of Ekron northward: that is, from the southwest of Palestine, near to which was the river Nile, to the northern part of it, where stood the principality of Ekron, one of the five which belonged to the Philistines: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>which is counted to the Canaanite; which was reckoned as belonging to the posterity of Canaan, though the Philistines got possession of it, who descended from Mizraim; and indeed it was only accounted as belonging to Canaan and his sons; of right, and according to the grant of God, it belonged to the seed of Abraham: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>five lords of the Philistines; who had not kings, as other countries and cities in the land of Canaan had, and their cities were called lordships, principalities, and not kingdoms, and are as follow: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the Eshkalonites, the Gittites,  
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the Ekronites: so called from Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron, the cities they were in possession of: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>also the Avites; it is not certain whether these were a distinct principality from the other five, or a people dispersed among them; which seems most likely, since those were the original inhabitants, but were driven out or destroyed by the Philistines, though it seems some remained and dwelt among them; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#023">Deu 2:23</a>. 
 </p><p>

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#004">Joshua 13:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">jos 13:4</a></font></span></p>From the south, all the land of the Canaanites,.... That is, of those Canaanites who were particularly so called, in distinction from those of the other nations or tribes, and who dwelt in several parts of the land, some in the east and others in the west, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#003">Jos 11:3</a>; and, as it seems here, some in the south: now on the side of the south, as Kimchi interprets it, all the land of the Canaanites was left, that is, remained unconquered and not possessed: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and Mearah that is beside the Sidonians; the inhabitants of Sidon, and parts adjacent: what this place was, which belonged to the Sidonians, for so it may better be rendered, is not certain; some take it to be a cave belonging to them: Sandys (b) speaks of a number of caves cut out of the rock in those parts, called the caves of the Sidonians, and afterwards the caves of Tyre; so it is interpreted by the Targum, and in the Syriac and Arabic versions others take it to be the river Magoras, Pliny (c) makes mention of as on the borders of Lebanon near Zidon and Berytus: mention is made of the waters of Mearah along with the waters of Tiberias in Jewish writings (d); but rather something of more importance than a cave or a river is meant; most likely a tract of land near Sidon, and which belonged to it, and reached 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto Aphek, to the borders of the Amorites; of this place; see Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#018">Jos 12:18</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">jos 13:5</a></font></span></p>And the land of the Giblites,.... This was another country that remained unconquered; the Greeks call it Byblus, and near to which Pliny (e) speaks of a place called Gabale, and is now called Gibyle; it is (f) said to be"pleasantly situated by the seaside, and at present it contains but a little extent of ground, but yet more than enough for the small number of its inhabitants:''it was in greater splendour, and its inhabitants of more fame, in the times of Ezekiel, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#009">Eze 27:9</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>and all Lebanon toward the sunrising; or east of the land; all that inhabited that mountain remained unconquered, though the conquest was carried as far as the borders thereof: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>from Baalgad, under Mount Hermon; of which see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017">Jos 11:17</a>; 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>unto the entering into Hamath: which was the north border of the land; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#008">Num 34:8</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(e) Ut supra. (Nat. Hist. l. 5. c. 20.) (f) Maundrel's Journey from Aleppo, &amp;c. p. 33. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#006">Joshua 13:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">jos 13:6</a></font></span></p>All the inhabitants of the hill country,.... Not in Judea, but in and about Lebanon, as follows: 
 <p>
 </p><p>from Lebanon unto Misrephothmaim; of which see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#008">Jos 11:8</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all the Sidonians; the inhabitants of the ancient city of Sidon, and the villages and lands belonging to it: these remained unconquered, and never were possessed by the Israelites: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>them will I drive out from before the children of Israel: which, though it may have a special respect unto the Sidonians, with whom the clause is closely connected, yet may include all the above lands unconquered, out of which, as well as Sidon, the Lord promises to drive the inhabitants, to make way for the children of Israel; that is, on condition of their obedience, for it appears that not only the Sidonians, but many others, even the chief, and most of those mentioned, were never possessed by them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>only divide thou it by lot unto the Israelites for an inheritance; that is, the whole land, as Abarbinel rightly remarks, both what was subdued and what was not; that was the business, and all the business, Joshua had now to do; he was not to be employed in making any further conquests, but leave them to others, and apply himself to the division of the land, by lot, to the tribes that as yet had no portion assigned them: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>as I have commanded thee; now, at this time. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#007">Joshua 13:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">jos 13:7</a></font></span></p>Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance,.... Having the command and authority of God for it, he was to set about it at once, with all diligence and application: 
 <p>
 </p><p>unto the nine tribes: of Judah, Simeon, Benjamin, Dan, Ephraim, Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali, in which order they are placed, when the Lord gave to Moses the names of the men that should divide the land under Eleazar and Joshua, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#016">Num 34:16</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and the half tribe of Manasseh; that half which had no inheritance on the other side Jordan, and for which a prince of the children of Joseph was appointed to divide, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#023">Num 34:23</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#008">Joshua 13:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">jos 13:8</a></font></span></p>With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their inheritance,.... That is, along with the half tribe of Manasseh, but not with that half of it before mentioned, who was to haven division of a part with the nine tribes, but with the other half of the tribe settled beyond Jordan; with them the tribes of Reuben and Gad had received their portion at their own request, and so were to have no share in the present distribution: 
 <p>
 </p><p>which Moses gave them beyond Jordan eastward; at their desire, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#001">Num 32:1</a>, and upon certain conditions to be performed by them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#020">Num 32:20</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>even as Moses the servant of the Lord gave them; this character of Moses, as the "servant of the Lord", seems to be observed to show that he gave the said tribes their inheritance: according to the will of God, and in obedience to it: here end the words of the Lord to Joshua, and next follows an account of the land given to the two tribes and a half described by the writer of this book. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009">Joshua 13:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">jos 13:9</a></font></span></p>From Aroer, that is on the bank of the river Arnon,.... A city belonging to Moab, from whence the description begins, the river Arnon, on which it was situated, being the border between Moab and the Amorites, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#013">Num 21:13</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the city that is in the midst of the river; or "even the city"; meaning the same city of Aroer, it lying both on the bank of it, and in the middle of it, or it was a double city, as may seem from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa017.htm#002">Isa 17:2</a>; and so differently situated at that river: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all the plains of Medeba unto Dibon; of these two places, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#030">Num 21:30</a>; between them lay a plain, which some take to be the plain of Moab; but it rather seems to be a plain that was between these two places, and, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017">Jos 13:17</a>, Dibon itself was in a plain. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#010">Joshua 13:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">jos 13:10</a></font></span></p>And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon,.... A city he took from the Moabites, and made it his royal seat, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#026">Num 21:26</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>unto the border of the children of Ammon; which was the river Jabbok, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#016">Deu 3:16</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#011">Joshua 13:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">jos 13:11</a></font></span></p>And Gilead,.... The land of Gilead, which was part of the kingdom of Og, half of which was given to Reuben, and the other half to Gad: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites; of which see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#014">Deu 3:14</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all Mount Hermon; called also Sirion, Shenir, and Sion, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#009">Deu 3:9</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all Bashan unto Salcah; another part of the dominions of Og, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#010">Deu 3:10</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#012">Joshua 13:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">jos 13:12</a></font></span></p>All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and in Edrei,.... See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#004">Jos 12:4</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>who remained of the remnant of the giants; was descended from those that remained in Ashtaroth, after the rest were cut off by Chedorlaomer, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005">Gen 14:5</a>; called there the Rephaim, as here: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>for these did Moses smite, and cast them out: that is, not only the giants, but the inhabitants of the above kingdom, the greatest part of them; for the Geshurites and the Maachathites are excepted in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013">Jos 13:13</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#013">Joshua 13:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">jos 13:13</a></font></span></p>Nevertheless, the children of Israel expelled not the Geshurites, nor the Maachathites,.... Neither in the times of Moses, nor in the times of Joshua: 
 <p>
 </p><p>but the Geshurites and the Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day: in full possession of their cities unmolested; yea, in later times they became separate and distinct kingdoms; for we read both of the king of Geshur, and of the king of Maachah, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2003.htm#003">Sa2 3:3</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#014">Joshua 13:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">jos 13:14</a></font></span></p>Only unto the tribe of Levi he gave none inheritance,.... Neither the Lord, nor Moses by his order, nor did he appoint any inheritance for them, either beyond Jordan, or on this side it, for the Lord was to be their inheritance, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020">Num 18:20</a>; 
 <p>
 </p><p>the sacrifices of the Lord God of Israel made by fire are their inheritance, as he said unto them; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#001">Deu 18:1</a>; and which are put for the whole of what was granted to them for their subsistence, as tithes, firstfruits, &amp;c. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#015">Joshua 13:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">jos 13:15</a></font></span></p>And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben inheritance according to their families. According to the number of them, and sufficient for them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#016">Joshua 13:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">jos 13:16</a></font></span></p>And their coast was from Aroer that is on the bank of the river Arnon,.... As the country of Sihon is described, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009">Jos 13:9</a>; from whence it appears that it was his country which was given to Reuben, though not all of it: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the city that is in the midst of the river; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009">Jos 13:9</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all the plain by Medeba; which reached unto Dibon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009">Jos 13:9</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#017">Joshua 13:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">jos 13:17</a></font></span></p>Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain,.... Which was by Medeba, and reached to Dibon: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Dibon, and Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon; Dibon was rebuilt by Gad, though it belonged to Reuben, and perhaps was inhabited by both, being on the borders of each; and Bamothbaal signifies the high places of Baal; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num022.htm#041">Num 22:41</a>; perhaps this is the same with Bamoth in the valley, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#020">Num 21:20</a>; and Bethbaalmeon is the same with Baalmeon in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038">Num 32:38</a>; where it is highly probable was a temple of Baal, since both "beth" signifies an house, and "meon" an habitation. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#018">Joshua 13:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">jos 13:18</a></font></span></p>And Jahazah,.... Called Jahaz, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num021.htm#023">Num 21:23</a>, where the battle was fought between Sihon and Israel: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and Kedemoth; near to which was a wilderness, which took its name from it, from whence Moses sent messengers with words of peace to Sihon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#026">Deu 2:26</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and Mephaath; thought to be the Maipha of Ptolemy (f); here Jerom says (g), in his time was a garrison of Roman soldiers, because of the desert that was near. It was a city, with its suburbs, given to the Levites, as were the two preceding, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos021.htm#036">Jos 21:36</a>; Adrichomius (h) takes it to be the same with Malle, which, Josephus says, (i) was called the city of the strangers.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">jos 13:19</a></font></span></p>And Kirjathaim,.... Of which See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#037">Num 32:37</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>and Sibmah; of which See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#003">Num 32:3</a> and See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#038">Num 32:38</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and Zarethshahar, in the mount of the valley; which was built on one of the mountains that looked over the valley of Moab, as did Nebo, Pisgah, Abarim; perhaps it is the same place Josephus (k) calls Zara, to which he joins the valley of the Cilicians, and mentions it along with Heshbon, Medeba, and other cities of Moab; according to Adrichomius (l), it was in the mount of the valley of Bethpeor, which next follows.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">jos 13:20</a></font></span></p>And Bethpeor,.... So called from Peor, the idol of the Moabites, and where very likely there had been a temple built to the honour of it; over against this place was a valley, where Israel abode some time, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#029">Deu 3:29</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>and Ashdodpisgah; of which see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017">Deu 3:17</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and Bethjeshimoth; of which see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num033.htm#049">Num 33:49</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">jos 13:21</a></font></span></p>And all the cities of the plain,.... In the champaign country, as well as those in the mountainous part: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and all the kingdom of Sihon; or, as Masius renders the words, "which all had been the kingdom of Sihon"; for the whole kingdom of Sihon was not given to Reuben, only a part of it, and the rest to Gad, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#027">Jos 13:27</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon; as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#010">Jos 13:10</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>whom Moses smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur,  
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and Hur, and Reba; not at the same time that Sihon was smitten by him, but afterwards in a war with Midian, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008">Num 31:8</a>; where their names are given as here; and there they are called kings of Midian, petty kings, and, as it seems by what follows, were subject to Sihon, and therefore are here mentioned: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>which were dukes of Sihon dwelling in the country; for Midian, as Kimchi supposes, and not without reason, was under the government of Sihon, and these were his nobles, though they dwelt in the land of Midian.

At the same time that the princes of Midian were slain, and which is also observed; see Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#008">Num 31:8</a>. Kimchi supposes that he returned to Midian, on hearing that the counsel he gave to them, to ensnare Israel with their daughters, had taken effect, in order to receive his wages, and so received his righteous doom and just reward; it is commonly said by the Jews (m), that he was slain by Phinehas: 
 <p>
 </p><p>among them that were slain by them; among the above princes, and the common soldiers, of which there was a great slaughter; even all the males of Midian were slain, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num031.htm#007">Num 31:7</a>.

 <p>
 </p><p>and all the cities of Gilead; which lay in those parts, for the whole was not given to this tribe, half of Gilead was given to the half tribe of Manasseh, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#031">Jos 13:31</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and half the land of the children of Ammon; not what then belonged to them, but what had been taken from them by the Amorites; and which Israel taking from them, had a right to retain, though they were forbid meddling with any of their land in present possession; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#019">Deu 2:19</a> <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jdg011.htm#013">Jdg 11:13</a>,

 </p><p>unto Aroer that is before Rabbath; Aroer was a city of Moab, situated on the river Arnon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos013.htm#009">Jos 13:9</a>; and stood over against Rabbath, a city of the Amorites, since called Philadelphia, the same that Joab took, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2012.htm#026">Sa2 12:26</a>; though Reland thinks (n), that according to the situation of these cities another Aroer must be here meant, and which belonged to the Amorites.

 <p>
 </p><p>and from Mahanaim unto the border of Debir; the former of these was the place where the angels met Jacob, and who gave it the name from thence; and in later times a city of this name was built there, and was near the river Jabbok, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#002">Gen 32:2</a>; Debir is different from that in the tribe of Judah, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos015.htm#015">Jos 15:15</a>; in the Septuagint version here it is called Daibon, perhaps the same with Dibon, the tribe of Gad rebuilt, and is called Dibongad, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num032.htm#034">Num 32:34</a>; unless Lidbar here should be the same with Lodebar in Gilead, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2017.htm#027">Sa2 17:27</a>.

 </p><p>

 </p><p>all Bashan; so famous for its oxen, and for pasturage for them, and for its oaks, called by Josephus Batanea: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>all the kingdom of Og king of Bashan; which, besides Bashan, took in the kingdom of Argob or Trachonitis, half the land of Gilead, all which was possessed by the half tribe of Manasseh: see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#013">Deu 3:13</a>,

 </p><p>
 </p><p>even to one half of the children of Machir, by their families; which seems to confirm it that Manasseh had no other son, since his whole posterity, both the half tribe on the other side, as well as that in the land of Canaan, were denominated from him; though he seems to have had another son, who perhaps died without issue, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1007.htm#014">Ch1 7:14</a>.

 </p><p>the Lord God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto them; what was given to the Lord out of the sacrifices, and the tithes, and firstfruits, that were theirs; see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num018.htm#020">Num 18:20</a>.
