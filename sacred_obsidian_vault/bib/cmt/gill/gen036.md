 <p>
 </p><p>This chapter gives us a genealogical account of Esau's family, of his wives and sons, with whom he removed from Seir, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001">Gen 36:1</a>; of his sons' sons, or grandsons, who were dukes in the land of Edom, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011">Gen 36:11</a>; after which is inserted a genealogy of Seir the Horite, into whose family Esau married, and of his children, and the dukes among them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020">Gen 36:20</a>; then follows a list of the kings of Edom, before there were any in Israel, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#031">Gen 36:31</a>; and the chapter is closed with a brief narration of the dukes of Esau, according to their families, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#040">Gen 36:40</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#001">Genesis 36:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">gen 36:1</a></font></span></p>Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom. Who was surnamed Edom, from the red pottage he sold his birthright for to his brother Jacob, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen025.htm#030">Gen 25:30</a>; an account is given of him, and his posterity, not only because he was a son of Isaac, lately made mention of as concerned in his burial; but because his posterity would be often taken notice of in the sacred Scriptures, and so their genealogy would serve to illustrate such passages; and Maimonides (m) thinks the principal reason is, that whereas Amalek, a branch of Esau's family, were to be destroyed by an express command of God, it was necessary that all the rest should be particularly described, lest they should all perish together; but other ends are answered hereby, as partly to show the fulfilment of the promise to Abraham, concerning the multiplication of his seed, and the accomplishment of the oracle to Rebekah, signifying that two nations were in her womb, one of which were those Edomites; as also to observe how the blessing of Isaac his father came upon him with effect, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen022.htm#017">Gen 22:17</a>.

 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002">Genesis 36:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">gen 36:2</a></font></span></p>And Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan,.... Of the Canaanites, the posterity of cursed Canaan, most of them were of them, though not all, the two following were, and so those, if different from them in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034">Gen 26:34</a>, one of his wives was of the family of Ishmael, as after related: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite; according to Jarchi and Aben Ezra, this is the same with Bashemath, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034">Gen 26:34</a>; and that she had two names: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite; the daughter of the one, and the granddaughter of the other, it being usual in Scripture to call grandchildren children, for Zibeon and Anah were father and son, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024">Gen 36:24</a>; and the Samaritan, Septuagint, and Syriac versions read here, "the daughter of Anah the son of Zibeon": there are an Anah and a Zibeon who were brethren, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020">Gen 36:20</a>; wherefore Aben Ezra supposes that these two brothers, or the father and son, lay with the same woman, and it could not be known whose child it was that was born of her, and therefore this was called the daughter of them both. Jarchi supposes this wife of Esau to be the same with Judith, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen026.htm#034">Gen 26:34</a>; but not only the names differ, but also the names of their fathers, and of the tribe or nation they were of. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#003">Genesis 36:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">gen 36:3</a></font></span></p>And Bashemath, Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebaioth,.... The eldest son of Ishmael, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen028.htm#009">Gen 28:9</a>; called there Mahalath. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#004">Genesis 36:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">gen 36:4</a></font></span></p>And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz,.... This son of Esau, according to Jerom (n), is the same with him mentioned in the book of Job, as one of his friends that came to visit him, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011">Job 2:11</a>; and so says the Targum of Jonathan on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#010">Gen 36:10</a>; but he rather was the grandson of this man, since he is called the Temanite: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and Bashemath bare Reuel; the name is the same with Reuel or Raguel, the name of Jethro; but cannot be the same person as is said by some, for he was a Midianite and not an Edomite, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo002.htm#018">Exo 2:18</a>. 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>(n) Trad. Heb. in Gen. fol. 71. L. tom. 3. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#005">Genesis 36:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">gen 36:5</a></font></span></p>And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah,.... In this genealogy mention is made of another Korah among the sons of Eliphaz, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#016">Gen 36:16</a>; which Jarchi thinks is the same with this, and takes him to be a bastard, and begotten in incest by Eliphaz, on his father's wife Aholibamah; but Aben Ezra observes, that some are of opinion that there were two Korahs, one the son of Aholibamah, and the other the son of Adah; but he thinks there were but one, which was the son of Aholibamah, and is reckoned among the sons of Eliphaz, because he dwelt among them; or perhaps his mother died when he was little, and Adah brought him up with her sons, and so was reckoned her son; such were the children of Michal, Saul's daughter: 
 <p>
 </p><p>these are the sons of Esau, which were born to him in the land of Canaan; and we do not read of any born to him elsewhere; so that of all his wives, which some think were four, others five, he had but five sons; what daughters he had is not related, though from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006">Gen 36:6</a>, it appears he had some. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006">Genesis 36:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">gen 36:6</a></font></span></p>And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters,.... The names of his wives and sons are before given; but what were the names of his daughters, or their number, is not said: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and all the persons of his house: his menservants and maidservants that were born in his house, or bought with his money; the word for "persons" signifies "souls" (o), and is sometimes used for slaves that are bought and sold, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze027.htm#013">Eze 27:13</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and his cattle, and all his beasts; his sheep and oxen, camels and asses: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and all his substance which he had got in the land of Canaan: before he went to Seir the first time, part of which he might leave behind in Canaan, with servants to improve it; and also that part of his father's personal estate which fell to him at his death, as well as what he might further acquire after his death, during his stay in Canaan: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and went into the country from the face of his brother Jacob; not into another part of the same country; but into another country, as the Targums of Onkelos and Jonathan supply it, and so the Arabic version, even unto Seir, as appears by what follows; and whither he had been before, and had obtained large possessions, and now having got all he could at his father's death, and collecting together all his other substance, thought fit to retire from thence to Seir, which he liked better, and for a reason afterwards given; God thus disposing his mind, and making the circumstances of things necessary, that he should remove in order to make way for Jacob, and his posterity, to dwell in a land which was designed for them: and so the Samaritan and Septuagint versions read it, "and he went out of the land of Canaan": and the Syriac version is, "and he went to the land of Seir". Some render the words to this sense, that he went thither "before the coming of Jacob" (p); and it is true that he did go thither before his brother came again into Canaan; but of this the text speaks not, for what follows will not agree with it; others better, "because of Jacob" (q); not for fear of him, as the Targum of Jonathan, which paraphrases the words,"for the terror of his brother Jacob was cast upon him;''but because he knew, by the blessing of his father, and the oracle of God, and his concurring providence in all things, that the land of Canaan belonged to him, and also for a reason that follows.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">gen 36:7</a></font></span></p>For their riches were more than that they might dwell together,.... And therefore it was proper to part, as Abraham and Lot had done before, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen013.htm#006">Gen 13:6</a>, 
 <p>
 </p><p>and the land wherein they were strangers could not bear them, because of their cattle; their cattle were so numerous that they could not get pasturage for them, there not being enough left them by the inhabitants of it for them to occupy; nor could they hire land of them sufficient for them both; they being not possessors but sojourners in it, and therefore could have no more of it than the inhabitants thought fit to let unto them. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#008">Genesis 36:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">gen 36:8</a></font></span></p>Thus dwelt Esau in Mount Seir,.... Before he is said to be in the land of Seir, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen032.htm#003">Gen 32:3</a>; now to dwell in a mount of that name; from which driving the Horites, he seized upon and dwelt in it; it had not its name from his own rough, shaggy hair, as Josephus says (r), much less from the satyrs, and hairy demons that frequented it, as R. Abraham Seba (s), but rather from Seir the Horite who inhabited the land, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#020">Gen 36:20</a>; unless he had his name from the mountain which might be so called, from its being rough and rugged like shaggy hair, and being covered with bushes and brambles which carried such a resemblance; and so it stands opposed to Mount Halak near it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos011.htm#017">Jos 11:17</a>, which signifies the bald or smooth mountain, being destitute of shrubs, &amp;c. The Targum of Jonathan calls this mountain Mount Gabla, and one part of the land of Edom, or Idumea, was called Gobolites, as Josephus (t) relates, perhaps the same with Gebal, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa083.htm#007">Psa 83:7</a>; hither Esau went and took up his residence, after things were amicably adjusted between him and his brother Jacob; the Jews say (u), that Isaac left, all he had to his two sons, and that after they had buried him, Esau said to Jacob, let us divide what our father has left us into two parts, and I will choose because I am the firstborn; so Jacob divided it into two parts; all that his father had left he made one part, and the land of Israel the other part, and Esau took what his father left, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#006">Gen 36:6</a>; and the land of Israel and the cave of Machpelah he delivered to Jacob, and they drew up everlasting writings between them. Now this or something like it being the case, and those the circumstances of fixings, thus, and by that means, so it came to pass, that Esau dwelt in Seir; and Jacob remained secure and quiet in the land of Canaan: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Esau is Edom, so called from the red pottage he had of Jacob, which is repeated to fix the odium of that transaction upon him, as well as for the sake of what follows, showing the reason why his posterity were called Edomites.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">gen 36:9</a></font></span></p>And these are the generations of Esau,.... Or the posterity of Esau, his children and grandchildren, as before and hereafter related:

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">gen 36:10</a></font></span></p>These are the names of Esau's sons,.... In this and some following verses, an account is given of the sons of Esau, which agrees with what is before observed, and of his sons' sons: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Eliphaz the son of Adah the wife of Esau: who seems to be his first wife, and this his first son: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Reuel the son of Bashemath and wife of Esau; his second son by another wife, a daughter of Ishmael, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#003">Gen 36:3</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011">Genesis 36:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">gen 36:11</a></font></span></p>And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman,.... This was his firstborn, and from him the city of Teman in Edom or Idumea had its name, see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer049.htm#007">Jer 49:7</a>; and Eliphaz is called the Temanite from hence, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job002.htm#011">Job 2:11</a>; four more sons are mentioned: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Omar, Zepho, and Gatam, and Kenaz; but I do not find that any towns or cities, or any part of the land of Edom, were denominated from any of them; only it may be observed that Zepho is called Zephi in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036">Ch1 1:36</a>; the account seems fabulous and not to be depended on, which Josephus Ben Gorion (w) gives of him, of opposing the burial of Jacob, being taken by Joseph and carried into Egypt, and at his death fleeing to Carthage, and from thence to the Romans, and was king of them (x).

She is said to be the sister of Lotan, the eldest son of Seir the Horite, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#022">Gen 36:22</a>; in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036">Ch1 1:36</a> mention is made of Timna among the sons of Eliphaz, and of Duke Timnah here, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#040">Gen 36:40</a>; and Gerundinsis (y) is of opinion, that Timnah the concubine of Eliphaz, after she had bore Amalek, conceived and bore another son, and she dying in childbirth, he called it by her name to perpetuate her memory: but Jarchi says, that Eliphaz lay with Lotan's mother, the wife of Seir the Horite, of whom was born Timna, and when she grew up she became his concubine, and so was both his daughter and his concubine: 
 <p>
 </p><p>and she bare to Eliphaz Amalek; from whence the Amalekites sprung, often mentioned in Scripture, whom the Israelites were commanded utterly to destroy, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#018">Sa1 15:18</a>, 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>these were the sons of Adah, Esau's wife; that is, her grandsons.

 <p>
 </p><p>the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife,.... See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002">Gen 36:2</a>; here also the Samaritan and Septuagint versions read, "the daughter of Anah, the son of Zibeon": 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>and she bare to Esau, Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah; this is repeated from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#005">Gen 36:5</a>; no mention is made of her grandchildren, as of his other wives.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">gen 36:15</a></font></span></p>These were dukes of the sons of Esau,.... Ben Melech says, the difference between a duke and a king was, that a king is crowned and a duke is not crowned; but Jarchi interprets the word of heads of families, which seems probable; so that as Esau's sons and grandsons are before related, here it is suggested that they had large and numerous families, of which they were the heads and governors; and in this and the following verses, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#016">Gen 36:16</a>; the sons and grandsons of Esau by his several wives are rehearsed as in the preceding verses, with the title of "duke" given to each of them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#016">Genesis 36:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">gen 36:16</a></font></span></p>Duke Korah,.... Only among the sons of Eliphaz is reckoned Duke Korah, not before mentioned among his sons, and is left out in the Samaritan version; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#007">Gen 36:7</a>; to which it may be added, that according to Gerundinsis (a), this is the same with Timna, related among the sons of Eliphaz, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch1001.htm#036">Ch1 1:36</a>; who was called by his father Korah: or this might be a grandson of Eliphaz.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">gen 36:20</a></font></span></p>These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land,.... "Before", as the Targum of Jonathan adds, that is, before it was inhabited by Esau and his posterity, and called Edom, and had from him the name of Seir; but the Horites dwelt here before him, even in Abraham's time, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#006">Gen 14:6</a>; and who were so called from their dwelling under ground in holes and caves, with which the further part of the land of Edom abounded, and are the same the Greeks call Trogloditae: Jarchi says, from their Rabbins, these were very expert in the nature of the land, and knew what was fit for olives and what for vines. Now the genealogy of this man is here given, partly to show who were the ancient inhabitants of this land before they were drove out, and succeeded by Esau and his sons, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#012">Deu 1:12</a>; and partly because of the intermarriages of Esau and his posterity with them, whereby they more easily came into the possession of the country; for Esau married the daughter of Anah, the son of Zibeon, a son of Seir, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#011">Gen 36:11</a>; and Eliphaz took Timna, a sister of Lotan the son of Seir, to be his concubine, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#012">Gen 36:12</a>; the names of the sons of Seir follow: 
 <p>
 </p><p>Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah: the first of these is said (b) to be the same with Latinus, a king that reigned in Italy, which seems to be taken from the fancied resemblance of names. Zibeon and Anah are here spoken of as brethren, the sons of Seir; whereas in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#024">Gen 36:24</a>; they are made mention of as father and son; see Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#002">Gen 36:2</a>; Zibeon, according to the Jewish writers (c), committed incest with his mother, whence came Anah, and is called his brother, because of the same mother, and his son, as being begotten by him. They seem to seek for such kind of copulations to reproach the Edomites.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">gen 36:24</a></font></span></p>And these are the children of Zibeon,.... The third son of Self, and who had two sons: 
 <p>
 </p><p>both Ajah and Anah; of the latter it is observed: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as he fed the asses of Zibeon his father; who observed, while he was feeding his father's asses in the wilderness, that the he asses coupled with mares, or horses with the she asses, and produced another sort of creatures called mules; and by this means found out the way how such creatures might be produced, and practised it: so Aelianus says (d), that mules are not the produce of nature, but you may call it an adulterous invention of human contrivance and boldness, and a theft: this is the common interpretation, and to which our version leads: but against it it may be observed, that the word for "mules" is different from this here used, nor is this word ever used of mules, nor does it appear that there were any creatures of this sort before the days of David; nor is the word translated "found" ever used of that which before was not in being, but of what already existed; nor is there any mention of horses or mares in this account also; had it referred to a mixture of these creatures with asses, it would not have been omitted. Some think therefore the words are to be rendered, "he found waters in the wilderness"; sources and collections of waters which were not usual in a wilderness, and of great worth and use in desert lands, as Edom was, and in those hot countries, and the Vulgate Latin version renders it, "hot waters"; but then to the fixing of either of these versions, the word must be altered either in its points or letters, for which there is no authority. The Targum of Onkelos renders it mighty ones or giants, and may signify the "Emim", the "aleph" being changed for "yod", as Aben Ezra observes; and then the sense is, that these gigantic people, who were so called from the terror they taught upon their neighbours, and, who dwelt near the Horim in Seir, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu002.htm#010">Deu 2:10</a>, as they used to steal from their flocks, Anah lighted on them in the wilderness, and fell upon them, and took them; and with this agrees the Samaritan version, "he found giants, in the wilderness"; and so Abendana interprets the words: Aben Ezra observes that many interpret the word of plants or herbs; and a very learned (e) man is of opinion that the word used is the name of an useful herb or plant, first discovered by Anah. This Anah, though a keeper of his father's asses, is afterwards called Duke Anah; it being the custom of the sons of great personages to be the keepers of flocks and herds; See Gill on <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen029.htm#009">Gen 29:9</a>.

In the land that was afterwards called the land of Edom; for this laud was not so called when these kings began to reign: for, according to Bishop Cumberland (f), and those that follow him (g), these were Horite kings, who, after their defeat by Chedorlaomer, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen014.htm#005">Gen 14:5</a>; in order to secure themselves the better from such a calamity for the future, set up a kingdom, and which appears, by the following account, to be elective; and so Maimonides (h) observes, that not one of these kings were of Edom: and these were: 
 <p>
 </p><p>before there reigned any king over the children of Israel; and there being no kings over Israel until many years after the times of Moses, hence some have thought these words are inserted by some other writer after him; but there is no need to suppose that; for Moses knew, from foregoing prophecies and promises, that kings would arise out of them and reign over them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen017.htm#006">Gen 17:6</a>; and this he was so certain of, that he himself, by divine direction, gave laws and rules to the children of Israel respecting their future kings, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu017.htm#014">Deu 17:14</a>; besides Moses himself was king in Jeshurun or Israel, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu033.htm#005">Deu 33:5</a>, so that it is the same as if he had said, these are the kings that reigned in Edom, before this time.

 </p><p>Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in his stead: this king some have thought to be the same with Job, and from whom one of the books of Scripture has its name; but neither their names, nor age, nor country agree: who this Jobab and his father Zerah were cannot be said: they seem to be of the same country in which Jobab reigned, since he is said to be of Bozrah, a famous city of Idumea, after spoken of in the prophets Isaiah and Jeremiah and others, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa034.htm#006">Isa 34:6</a>; Jarchi takes it to be a city of Moab, and indeed it is sometimes placed in Moab, and sometimes in Edom, it being on the borders of both, and sometimes belonged to the one and sometimes to the other. According to Mr. Bedford (k), this king began his reign, A. M. 2135, so that the former king must have reigned about forty two years; which is a space of time he allows to each successor, taking them one with another, the particular and exact time of each reign he not being able to fix.

After the regal monarchy ceased, the government in Edom was by dukes, and of these there were two sons, one of which an account has been given of already, who were partly of the race of Seir, and partly of the race of Esau; and who were dukes not by succession, but together, in and over their respective families: and it may be observed, that neither Esau, nor his sons by his two first wives, Eliphaz and Reuel, are called dukes, only his three sons by his last wife; all the rest are his grandsons and sons of the two former, which seems to give some light as to the time when those dukedoms took place; and very probably it was by the joint influence of Seir and Esau, whose families had intermarried, that an end was put to the regal power, and who, for a course of years, governed in the above manner: and they of Esau's race in those times are said to be "dukes in the land of Edom", as a learned man (o) has observed; whereas those that follow, which are a second race of them, are called "dukes of Edom", <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen036.htm#043">Gen 36:43</a>; who took possession of the country and ruled in it, driving out the Horites and succeeding in their stead: these are described 
 <p>
 </p><p>according to their families; they were the heads of: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>after their places, by their names; the places where they lived, which were called after their names, and are as follow: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>Duke Timnah, Duke Alvah, Duke Jetheth; these were both the names of the dukes, and of the places where they governed, called after their names; so Timnah or Themna, as Jerom calls it, is by him said to be a city of the princes of Edom, the same he says of Jetheth (p), so the like may be concluded of Alvah.

There was a Kenaz the son of Eliphaz, and so a Teman a son of his, who were both dukes; but these seem to be different from them, though the latter might be duke of the place called Teman from him: which, in Jerom's time (t), was a village five miles distant from Petra, and where was a Roman garrison, and so Mabsar in his times (u), was a large village in the country of Gabalena (a part of Idumea), and called Mabsara, and belonged to the city Petra.

Magdiel also, Jerom (w) says, was in the country of Gabalena, formerly possessed by the dukes of Edom; and the Targum of Jonathan says, this duke was called Magdiel from the name of his city, which was a strong "migdal" or tower: and Jarchi's note upon this word is, this is Rome; so the Jewish writers elsewhere say (x), that Esau had an hundred provinces from Seir to Magdiel; as it is said, "Duke Magdiel, Duke Iram", this is Rome: 
 <p>
 </p><p>these be the dukes of Edom, according to their habitations, in the land of their possession; the former race of dukes, as has been observed, were dukes in the land of Edom, were sojourners in the land, at least had not sovereign dominion, or were not the only dukes in it; there were dukes of the race of Seir at the same time; but now these having driven out the Horites, were sole possessors and sovereign lords; and thus while Israel and his posterity were sojourners in a strange land, Esau and his family were possessors and lords of a country they could call their own: 
 </p><p>
 </p><p>he is Esau the father of the Edomites; that is, Edom, the dukes of whose race are before reckoned up; the same is Esau, who had the name of Edom from selling his birthright for a mess of red pottage: and this is the man from whom the Edomites or Idumeans sprung, often hereafter spoken of in the Scripture, though no more in this history. He is said (y) to be killed by the tribes of Israel, at the funeral of Jacob, he coming forth with a great army to hinder his interment in the cave of Machpelah: it is a tradition of the Jews (z), he was slain by Judah.
