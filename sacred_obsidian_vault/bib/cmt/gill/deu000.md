 <p>
 </p><p>This book is sometimes called "Elleh hadebarim", from the words with which it begins; and sometimes by the Jews "Mishneh Torah", the repetition of the law; and so in the Syriac version, with which agrees the Arabic title of it; and when the Greeks, and we after them, call it "Deuteronomy", it is not to be understood of a second, a new, or another law, but of the law formerly delivered, but now repeated, and also more largely explained; to which are likewise added several particular laws, instructions, and directions; all which were necessary, on account of the people of Israel, who were now a new generation, that either were not born, or not at an age to hear and understand the law when given on Mount Sinai; the men that heard it there being all dead, excepting a very few; and these people were also now about to enter into the land of Canaan, which they were to enjoy as long as they kept the law of God, and no longer, and therefore it was proper they should be reminded of it; and besides, Moses was now about to leave them, and having an hearty desire after their welfare, spends the little time he had to be with them, by inculcating into them and impressing on them the laws of God, and in opening and explaining them to them, and enforcing them on them, which were to be the rule of their obedience, and on which their civil happiness depended. And sometimes the Jews call this book "the book of reproofs", because there are in it several sharp reproofs of the people of Israel for their rebellion and disobedience; and so the Targums of Jonathan and Jerusalem begin it by calling it the words of reproof which Moses spake, &amp;c. That this book was written by Moses there can be no doubt, from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001">Deu 1:1</a>, only the eight last verses, which give an account of his death, and of his character, were wrote by another hand, equally inspired by God, as either Eleazar the priest, as some, or Samuel the prophet, as others; or, as it is the more commonly received opinion of the Jews, Ezra; though it is highly probable they were wrote by Joshua his successor. This book was written and delivered by Moses, at certain times in the last month of his life, and towards the close of the fortieth year of the children of Israel's coming out of Egypt. And that it is of divine authority need not be questioned, when the several quotations out of it are observed, as made by the apostles of Christ, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act003.htm#022">Act 3:22</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb010.htm#030">Heb 10:30</a> out of <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015">Deu 18:15</a> and by our Lord himself, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#016">Mat 18:16</a> from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#015">Deu 19:15</a>. Yea, it is remarkable, that all the passages of Scripture produced by Christ, to repel the temptations of Satan, are all taken out of this book, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007">Mat 4:7</a> compared with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003">Deu 8:3</a>, and the voice from heaven, directing the apostles to hearken to him, refers to a prophecy of him in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu018.htm#015">Deu 18:15</a>.
