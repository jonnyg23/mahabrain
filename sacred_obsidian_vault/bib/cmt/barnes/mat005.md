 <p>And seeing the multitudes - The great numbers that came to attend on his ministry. The substance of this discourse is recorded also in Luke 6. It is commonly called the "Sermon on the Mount." It is not improbable that it was repeated, in substance, on different occasions, and to different people. At those times parts of it may have been omitted, and Luke may have recorded it as it was pronounced on one of those occasions. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk006.htm#017">Luk 6:17-20</a>.
 </p><p>Went up into a mountain - This mountain, or hill, was somewhere in the vicinity of Capernaum, but where precisely is not mentioned. He ascended the hill, doubtless, because it was more convenient to address the multitude from an eminence than if he were on the same level with them. A hill or mountain is still shown a short distance to the northwest of the ancient site of Capernaum, which tradition reports to have been the place where this sermon was delivered, and which is called on the maps the Mount of Beatitudes. The hill commonly believed to be that on which the sermon was delivered is on the road from Nazareth to Tiberias, not far from the latter place. The hill is known by the name of Kuran Huttin, the Horns of Huttin. Of this hill Professor Hackett (Illustrations of Scripture, pp. 323, 324) says: "Though a noontide heat was beating down upon us with scorching power, I could not resist the temptation to turn aside and examine a place for which such a claim has been set up, though I cannot say that I have any great confidence in it. The hill referred to is rocky, and rises steeply to a moderate height above the plain. It has two summits, with a slight depression between them, and it is from these projecting points, or horns, that it receives the name given to it. From the top the observer has a full view of the Sea of Tiberias. The most pleasing feature of the landscape is that presented by the diversified appearance of the fields. The different plots of ground exhibit various colors, according to the state. of cultivation: some of them are red, where the land has been newly plowed up, the natural appearance of the soil; others yellow or white, where the harvest is beginning to ripen, or is already ripe; and others green, being covered with grass or springing grain. As they are contiguous to each other, or intermixed, these particolored plots present at some distance an appearance of joyful chequered work, which is really beautiful.
 </p><p>"In rhetorical descriptions of the delivery of the Sermon on the Mount, we often hear the people represented as looking up to the speaker from the sides of the hill, or listening to him from the plain. This would not be possible with reference to the present locality; for it is too precipitous and too elevated to allow of such a position. The Saviour could have sat there, however, in the midst of his hearers, for it affords a platform amply large enough for the accommodation of the hundreds who may have been present on that occasion."
 </p><p>And when he was set - This was the common mode of teaching among the Jews, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#020">Luk 4:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk005.htm#003">Luk 5:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#002">Joh 8:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014">Act 13:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#013">Act 16:13</a>.
 </p><p>His disciples came unto him - The word "disciples" means "learners," those who are taught. Here it is put for those who attended on the ministry of Jesus, and does not imply that they were all Christians. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#066">Joh 6:66</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#003">Matthew 5:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mat 5:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed are the poor in spirit - The word "blessed" means "happy," referring to that which produces felicity, from whatever quarter it may come.
 </p><p>Poor in spirit - Luke says simply, Blessed are the poor. It has been disputed whether Christ meant the poor in reference to the things of this life, or to the humble. The gospel is said to be preached to the poor, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018">Luk 4:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#005">Mat 11:5</a>. It was predicted that the Messiah would preach to the poor, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isa 61:1</a>. It is said that they have special facilities for being saved, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#023">Mat 19:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk018.htm#024">Luk 18:24</a>. The state of such persons is therefore comparatively blessed, or happy. Riches produce care, anxiety, and dangers, and not the least is the danger of losing heaven by them. To be poor in spirit is to have a humble opinion of ourselves; to be sensible that we are sinners, and have no righteousness of our own; to be willing to be saved only by the rich grace and mercy of God; to be willing to be where God places us, to bear what he lays on us, to go where he bids us, and to die when he commands; to be willing to be in his hands, and to feel that we deserve no favor from him. It is opposed to pride, and vanity, and ambition. Such are happy:
 </p><p>1. Because there is more real enjoyment in thinking of ourselves as we are, than in being filled with pride and vanity.
 </p><p>2. Because such Jesus chooses to bless, and on them he confers his favors here.
 </p><p>3. Because theirs will be the kingdom of heaven hereafter.
 </p><p>It is remarkable that Jesus began his ministry in this manner, so unlike all others. Other teachers had taught that happiness was to be found in honor, or riches, or splendor, or sensual pleasure. Jesus overlooked all those things, and fixed his eye on the poor and the humble, and said that happiness was to be found in the lowly vale of poverty more than in the pomp and splendors of life.
 </p><p>Theirs is the kingdom of heaven - That is, either they have special facilities for entering the kingdom of heaven, and of becoming Christians here, or they shall enter heaven hereafter. Both these ideas are probably included. A state of poverty a state where we are despised or unhonored by people is a state where people are most ready to seek the comforts of religion here, and a home in the heavens hereafter. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002">Mat 2:2</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#004">Matthew 5:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mat 5:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed are they that mourn - This is capable of two meanings: either, that those are blessed who are afflicted with the loss of friends or possessions, or that they who mourn over sin are blessed. As Christ came to preach repentance, to induce people to mourn over their sins and to forsake them, it is probable that he had the latter particularly in view. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2007.htm#010">Co2 7:10</a>. At the same time, it is true that the gospel only can give true comfort to those in affliction, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa061.htm#001">Isa 61:1-3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#018">Luk 4:18</a>. Other sources of consolation do not reach the deep sorrows of the soul. They may blunt the sensibilities of the mind; they may produce a sullen and reluctant submission to what we cannot help: but they do not point to the true source of comfort. In the God of mercy only; in the Saviour; in the peace that flows from the hope of a better world, and there only, is there consolation, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2003.htm#017">Co2 3:17-18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co2005.htm#001">Co2 5:1</a>. Those that mourn thus shall be comforted. So those that grieve over sin; that sorrow that they have committed it, and are afflicted and wounded that they have offended God, shall find comfort in the gospel. Through the merciful Saviour those sins may be forgiven. In him the weary and heavy-ladened soul shall find peace <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#028">Mat 11:28-30</a>; and the presence of the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, shall sustain them here <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#026">Joh 14:26-27</a>, and in heaven all their tears shall be wiped away, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev021.htm#004">Rev 21:4</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#005">Matthew 5:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mat 5:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The meek - Meekness is patience in the reception of injuries. It is neither meanness nor a surrender of our rights, nor cowardice; but it is the opposite of sudden anger, of malice, of long-harbored vengeance. Christ insisted on his right when he said, "If I have done evil, bear witness of the evil; but if well, why smitest thou me?" <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#023">Joh 18:23</a>. Paul asserted his right when he said, "They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast us into prison; and now do they thrust us out privily? nay verily; but let them come themselves, and fetch us out," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#037">Act 16:37</a>. And yet Christ was the very model of meekness. It was one of his characteristics, "I am meek," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat011.htm#029">Mat 11:29</a>. So of Paul. No man endured more wrong, or endured it more patiently than he. Yet the Saviour and the apostle were not passionate. They bore all patiently. They did not press their rights through thick and thin, or trample down the rights of others to secure their own.
 </p><p>Meekness is the reception of injuries with a belief that God will vindicate us. "Vengeance is his; he will repay," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#019">Rom 12:19</a>. It little becomes us to take his place, and to do what he has promised to do.
 </p><p>Meekness produces peace. It is proof of true greatness of soul. It comes from a heart too great to be moved by little insults. It looks upon those who offer them with pity. He that is constantly ruffled; that suffers every little insult or injury to throw him off his guard and to raise a storm of passion within, is at the mercy of every mortal that chooses to disturb him. He is like "the troubled sea that cannot rest, whose waters cast up mire and dirt."
 </p><p>They shall inherit the earth - This might have been translated the land. It is probable that here is a reference to the manner in which the Jews commonly expressed themselves to denote any great blessing. It was promised to them that they should inherit the land of Canaan. For a long time the patriarchs looked forward to this, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen015.htm#007">Gen 15:7-8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo032.htm#013">Exo 32:13</a>. They regarded it as a great blessing. It was so spoken of in the journey in the wilderness, and their hopes were crowned when they took possession of the promised land, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#038">Deu 1:38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#020">Deu 16:20</a>. In the time of our Saviour they were in the constant habit of using the Old Testament, where this promise perpetually occurs, and they used it "as a proverbial expression to denote any great blessing, perhaps as the sum of all blessings," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa037.htm#020">Psa 37:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa060.htm#021">Isa 60:21</a>. Our Saviour used it in this sense, and meant to say, not that the meek would own great property or have many lands, but that they would possess special blessings. The Jews also considered the land of Canaan as a type of heaven, and of the blessings under the Messiah. To inherit the land became, therefore, an expression denoting those blessings. When our Saviour uses this language here, he means that the meek shall be received into his kingdom, and partake of its blessings here, and of the glories of the heavenly Canaan hereafter. The value of meekness, even in regard to worldly property and success in life, is often exhibited in the Scriptures, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#024">Pro 22:24-25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro015.htm#001">Pro 15:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#008">Pro 25:8</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro025.htm#015">Pro 25:15</a>. It is also seen in common life that a meek, patient, mild man is the most prospered. An impatient and quarrelsome man raises up enemies; often loses property in lawsuits; spends his time in disputes and broils rather than in sober, honest industry; and is harassed, vexed, and unsuccessful in all that he does. "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1004.htm#008">Ti1 4:8</a>. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1006.htm#003">Ti1 6:3-6</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#006">Matthew 5:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mat 5:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed are they which do hunger ... - Hunger and thirst, here, are expressive of strong desire. Nothing would better express the strong desire which we ought to feel to obtain righteousness than hunger and thirst. No needs are so keen, none so imperiously demand supply, as these. They occur daily, and when long continued, as in case of those shipwrecked, and doomed to wander months or years over burning sands, with scarcely any drink or food, nothing is more distressing. An ardent desire for anything is often represented in the Scriptures by hunger and thirst, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa042.htm#001">Psa 42:1-2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa063.htm#001">Psa 63:1-2</a>. A desire for the blessings of pardon and peace; a deep sense of sin, and want, and wretchedness, is also represented by thirsting, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001">Isa 55:1-2</a>.
 </p><p>They shall be filled - They shall be satisfied as a hungry man is when supplied with food, or a thirsty man when supplied with drink. Those who are perishing for want of righteousness; those who feel that they are lost sinners and strongly desire to be holy, shall be thus satisfied. Never was there a desire to be holy which God was not willing to gratify, and the gospel of Christ has made provision to satisfy all who truly desire to be holy. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa055.htm#001">Isa 55:1-3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa065.htm#013">Isa 65:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#014">Joh 4:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh006.htm#035">Joh 6:35</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh007.htm#037">Joh 7:37-38</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa017.htm#015">Psa 17:15</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#007">Matthew 5:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mat 5:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed are the merciful - That is, those who are so affected by the sufferings of others as to be disposed to alleviate them. This is given as an evidence of piety, and it is said that they who show mercy to others shall obtain it. The same sentiment is found in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#042">Mat 10:42</a>; "Whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little ones a cup of cold water only, in the name of a disciple, verily I say unto you he shall in no wise lose his reward." See also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#034">Mat 25:34-40</a>. This should be done with a wish to glorify God; that is, in obedience to his commandments, and with a desire that he should be honored, and with a feeling that we are benefiting one of his creatures. Then he will regard it as done to him, and will reward us. See the sentiment of this verse, that the merciful shall obtain mercy, more fully expressed in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2022.htm#026">Sa2 22:26-27</a>; and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa018.htm#025">Psa 18:25-26</a>.
 </p><p>Nowhere do we imitate God more than in showing mercy. In nothing does God delight more than in the exercise of mercy, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#006">Exo 34:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eze033.htm#011">Eze 33:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1002.htm#004">Ti1 2:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2003.htm#009">Pe2 3:9</a>. To us, guilty sinners; to us, wretched, dying, and exposed to eternal woe, he has shown his mercy by giving his Son to die for us; by expressing his willingness to pardon and save us; and by sending his Spirit to renew and sanctify our hearts. Each day of our life, each hour, and each moment, we partake of his undeserved mercy. All the blessings we enjoy are proofs of his mercy. If we, then, show mercy to the poor, the wretched, the guilty, it shows that we are like God. We have his spirit, and shall not lose our reward. And we have abundant opportunity to do it. Our world is full of guilt and woe, which we may help to relieve; and every day of our lives we have opportunity, by helping the poor and wretched, and by forgiving those who injure us, to show that we are like God. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#014">Mat 6:14-15</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#008">Matthew 5:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mat 5:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed are the pure in heart - That is, whose minds, motives, and principles are pure; who seek not only to have the external actions correct, but who desire to be holy in heart, and who are so. Man looks on the outward appearance, but God looks on the heart.
 </p><p>They shall see God - There is a sense in which all will see God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#007">Rev 1:7</a>. That is, they will behold him as a Judge, not as a Friend. In this place it is spoken of as a special favor. So also in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev022.htm#004">Rev 22:4</a>, "And they shall see his face." To see the face of one, or to be in the presence of any one, were terms among the Jews expressive of great favor. It was regarded as a high honor to be in the presence of kings and princes, and to be permitted to see them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro022.htm#029">Pro 22:29</a>, "He shall stand before kings." See also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2025.htm#019">Kg2 25:19</a>, "Those that stood in the king's presence;" in the Hebrew, those that saw the face of the king; that is, who were his favorites and friends. So here, to see God, means to be his friends and favorites, and to dwell with him in his kingdom. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009">Matthew 5:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mat 5:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed are the peacemakers - Those who strive to prevent contention, strife, and war; who use their influence to reconcile opposing parties, and to prevent lawsuits and hostilities in families and neighborhoods. Every man may do something of this; and no man is more like God than he who does it. There ought not to be unlawful and officious interference in that which is none of our business; but without any danger of acquiring this character, every man has many opportunities of reconciling opposing parties. Friends, neighbors, people of influence, lawyers, physicians, ministers of the gospel, may do much to promote peace. And it should be taken in hand in the beginning. "The beginning of strife," says Solomon, "is like the letting out of water." "An ounce of prevention," says the English proverb, "is worth a pound of cure." Long and most deadly quarrels might often be prevented by a little kind interference in the beginning.
 </p><p>Children of God - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001">Mat 1:1</a>. Those who resemble God, or who manifest a spirit like his. He is the Author of peace <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1014.htm#033">Co1 14:33</a>; and all those who endeavor to promote peace are like him, and are worthy to be called his children. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010">Matthew 5:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mat 5:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed are they which are persecuted - To persecute means literally to pursue; follow after, as one does a flying enemy. Here it means to vex, or oppress one, on account of his religion. They persecute others who injure their names, reputation, property, or who endanger or take their life, on account of their religious opinions.
 </p><p>For righteousness' sake - Because they are righteous, or are the friends of God. We are not to seek persecution. We are not to provoke it by strange sentiments or conduct; by violating the laws of civil society, or by modes of speech that are unnecessarily offensive to others. But if, in the honest effort to be Christians, and to live the life of Christians, others persecute and revile us, we are to consider this as a blessing. It is an evidence that we are the children of God, and that he will defend us. "All that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2003.htm#012">Ti2 3:12</a>.
 </p><p>Theirs is the kingdom of heaven - They have evidence that they are Christians, and that they will be brought to heaven. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#011">Matthew 5:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mat 5:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Blessed are ye when men shall revile you - Reproach you; call you by evil and contemptuous names; ridicule you because you are Christians. Thus, they said of Jesus that he was a Samaritan and had a devil <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#048">Joh 8:48</a>; that he was mad <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh010.htm#020">Joh 10:20</a>; and thus they reviled and mocked him on the cross, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#039">Mat 27:39-44</a>. But, being reviled, he reviled not again <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#023">Pe1 2:23</a>; and thus being reviled, we should bless <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1004.htm#012">Co1 4:12</a>; and thus, though the contempt of the world is not in itself desirable, yet it is blessed to tread in the footsteps of Jesus, to imitate his example, and even to suffer for his sake, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/phi001.htm#029">Phi 1:29</a>.
 </p><p>All manner of evil against you falsely - An emphasis should be laid on the word falsely in this passage. It is not blessed to have evil spoken of us if we deserve it; but if we deserve it not, then we should not consider it as a calamity. We should take it patiently, and show how much the Christian, under the consciousness of innocence, can bear, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1003.htm#013">Pe1 3:13-18</a>.
 </p><p>For my sake - Because you are attached to me; because you are Christians. We are not to seek such things. We are not to do things to offend others; to treat them harshly or unkindly, and. to court revilings. We are not to say or do things, though they may be on the subject of religion, designed to disgust or offend. But if, in the faithful endeavor to be Christians, we are reviled, as our Master was, then we are to take it with patience, and to remember that thousands before us have been treated in like manner. When thus reviled or persecuted, we are to be meek, patient, humble; not angry; not reviling again; but endeavoring to do good to our persecutors and slanderers, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti2002.htm#024">Ti2 2:24-25</a>. In this way many have been convinced of the power and excellence of that religion which they were persecuting and reviling. They have seen that nothing else but Christianity could impart such patience and meekness to the persecuted; and have, by this means, been constrained to submit themselves to the gospel of Jesus. Long since it became a proverb, "that the blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church." 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#012">Matthew 5:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mat 5:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Rejoice, and be exceeding glad - Regard it as a great privilege thus to be persecuted and to suffer - a thing not to be mourned over, but as among the chief blessings of life.
 </p><p>For great is your reward in heaven - That is, your reward will be great in the future world. To those who suffer most, God imparts the highest rewards. Hence, the crown of martyrdom has been thought to be the brightest that any of the redeemed shall wear; and hence many of the early Christians sought to become martyrs, and threw themselves in the way of their persecutors, that they might be put to death. They literally rejoiced, and leaped for joy, at the prospect of death for the sake of Jesus. Though God does not require us to seek persecution, yet all this shows that there is something in religion to sustain the soul which the world does not possess. Nothing but the consciousness of innocence, and the presence of God, could bear up the sufferers in the midst of these trials; and the flame, therefore, kindled to consume the martyr, has also been a bright light, showing the truth and power of the gospel of Jesus.
 </p><p>The prophets ... - The holy men who came to predict future events, and who were the religious teachers of the Jews. For an account of their persecution, see Heb. 11. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#013">Matthew 5:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mat 5:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Ye are the salt of the earth - Salt renders food pleasant and palatable, and preserves from putrefaction. So Christians, by their lives and instructions, are to keep the world from entire moral corruption. By bringing down the blessing of God in answer to their prayers, and by their influence and example, they save the world from universal vice and crime.
 </p><p>Salt have lost its savour - That is, if it has become tasteless, or has lost its preserving properties. The salt used in this country is a chemical compound - chloride of sodium - and if the saltness were lost, or it were to lose its savor, there would be nothing remaining. It enters into the very nature of the substance. In eastern countries, however, the salt used was impure, or mingled with vegetable or earthy substances, so that it might lose the whole of its saltness, and a considerable quantity of earthy matter remain. This was good for nothing, except that it was used to place in paths, or walks, as we use gravel. This kind of salt is common still in that country. It is found in the earth in veins or layers, and when exposed to the sun and rain, loses its saltness entirely. Maundrell says, "I broke a piece of it, of which that part that was exposed to the rain, sun, and air, though it had the sparks and particles of salt, yet it had perfectly lost its savor. The inner part, which was connected to the rock, retained its savor, as I found by proof. So Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book, vol. ii. pp. 43, 44) says, "I have often seen just such salt, and the identical disposition of it that our Lord has mentioned. A merchant of Sidon having farmed of the government the revenue from the importation of salt, brought over an immense quantity from the marshes of Cyprus - enough, in fact, to supply the whole province for at least 20 years. This he had transferred to the mountains, to cheat the government out of some small percentage. Sixty-five houses in June - Lady Stanhope's village were rented and filled with salt. These houses have merely earthen floors, and the salt next the ground, in a few years, entirely spoiled. I saw large quantities of it literally thrown into the street, to be trodden underfoot by people and beasts. It was 'good for nothing.'
 </p><p>"It should be stated in this connection that the salt used in this country is not manufactured by boiling clean salt water, nor quarried from mines, but is obtained from marshes along the seashore, as in Cyprus, or from salt lakes in the interior, which dry up in summer, as the one in the desert north of Palmyra, and the great lake of Jebbul, southeast of Aleppo.
 </p><p>"Maundrell, who visited the lake at Jebbul, tells us that he found salt there which had entirely 'lost its savor,' and the same abounds among the debris at Usdum, and in other localities of rocksalt at the south end of the Dead Sea. Indeed, it is a well-known fact that the salt of this country, when in contact with the ground, or exposed to rain and sun, does become insipid and useless. From the manner in which it is gathered, much earth and other impurities are necessarily collected with it. Not a little of it is so impure that it cannot be used at all, and such salt soon effloresces and turns to dust - not to fruitful soil, however. It is not only good for nothing itself, but it actually destroys all fertility wherever it is thrown; and this is the reason why it is cast into the street. There is a sort of verbal verisimilitude in the manner in which our Lord alludes to the act: 'it is cast out' and 'trodden under foot;' so troublesome is this corrupted salt, that it is carefully swept up, carried forth, and thrown into the street. There is no place about the house, yard, or garden where it can be tolerated. No man will allow it to be thrown on to his field, and the only place for it is the street, and there it is cast to be trodden underfoot of men."

 <p>The light of the world - The light of the world often denotes the sun, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh011.htm#009">Joh 11:9</a>. The sun renders objects visible, shows their form, their nature, their beauties, their deformities. The term light is often applied to religious teachers. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016">Mat 4:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#032">Luk 2:32</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#004">Joh 1:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh008.htm#012">Joh 8:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa049.htm#006">Isa 49:6</a>. It is pre-eminently applied to Jesus in these places, because he is, in the moral world, what the sun is in the natural world. The apostles, Christian ministers, and all Christians, are lights of the world, because they, by their instructions and example, show what God requires, what is the condition of man, what is the way of duty, peace, and happiness the way that leads to heaven.
 </p><p>A city that is set on a hill ... - Many of the cities of Judea were placed on the summits or sides of mountains, and could be seen from afar. Perhaps Jesus pointed to such a city, and told his disciples that they were like it. Their actions could not be hid. The eyes of the world were upon them. They must be seen; and as this was the case, they ought to be holy, harmless, and undefiled.
 </p><p>Maundrell, Jowett, and others suppose that the Sermon on the Mount was delivered in the vicinity of the present city of Safed, or "the Horns of Huttin" (see the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001">Mat 5:1</a>), and that this city may have been in his eye, and may have been directly referred to by the Saviour when he uttered this sentiment. It would give additional force and beauty to the passage to suppose that he pointed to the city. Of this Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book, vol. i. pp. 420, 421) says, "The shape of the hill is a well-described oval, and the wall corresponds to it. The bottom of the outer ditch is now a very flourishing vineyard, and the entire circuit is not far from half a mile. The wall is mostly modern, but built on one more ancient, portions of which can be seen on the east side. The interior summit rises about a hundred feet higher than this wall, and was a separate castle, strongly defended. Here are beveled stones, as heavy, and as aged in appearance, as those of the most celebrated ruins in the country; and they prove that this has been a place of importance from a remote age. These ancient parts of the castle render it all but certain that there was then a city or citadel on this most conspicuous 'hill' top; and our Lord might well point to it to illustrate and confirm his precept. The present Hebrew name is Zephath, and may either refer to its elevation like a watchtower, or to the beauty and grandeur of the surrounding prospects. Certainly they are quite sufficient to suggest the name. There lies Gennesaret, like a mirror set in framework of dark mountains and many-faced hills. Beyond is the vast plateau of the Hauran, faintly shading with its rocky ranges the utmost horizon eastward. Thence the eye sweeps over Gilead and Bashan, Samaria and Carmel, the plains of Galilee, the coasts of Phoenicia, the hills of Naphtali, the long line of Lebanon, and the lofty head of Hermen - a vast panorama, embracing a thousand points of historic and sacred interest."

 <p>Neither do men light a candle ... - The word rendered "candle" means any portable light, as a lamp, candle, lantern. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar004.htm#021">Mar 4:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#016">Luk 8:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035">Luk 12:35</a>. Jesus proceeded here to show them that the very reason why they were enlightened was that others might also see the light, and be benefited by it. When people light a candle, they do not conceal the light, but place it where it may be of use. So it is with religion. It is given that we may benefit others. It is not to be concealed, but suffered to show itself, and to shed light on a surrounding wicked world.
 </p><p>A bushel - Greek, a measure containing nearly a peck. It denotes anything, here, that might conceal the light. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#016">Matthew 5:16</a></p>

 <p>Let your light so shine ... - Let your holy life, your pure conversation, and your faithful instructions, be everywhere seen and known. Always, in all societies, in all business, at home and abroad, in prosperity and adversity, let it be seen that you are real Christians.
 </p><p>That they may see your good works - The proper motive to influence us is not simply that we may be seen (compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#001">Mat 6:1</a>), but it should be that our heavenly Father may be glorified. The Pharisees acted to be seen of men, true Christians act to glorify God, and care little what people may think of them, except as by their conduct others may he brought to honor God, yet they should so live that people may see from their conduct what is the proper nature of their religion.
 </p><p>Glorify your Father - Praise, or honor God, or be led to worship him. Seeing in your lives the excellency of religion, and the power and purity of the gospel, they may be won to be Christians also, and give praise and glory to God for his mercy to a lost world.
 </p><p>We learn here:
 </p><p>1. that religion, if it exists, cannot be concealed.
 </p><p>2. that where it is not manifest in the life, it does not exist.
 </p><p>3. that "professors" of religion, who live like other people, give evidence that they have never been truly converted.
 </p><p>4. that to attempt to conceal or hide our Christian knowledge or experience is to betray our trust, injure the cause of piety, and to render our lives useless. And,
 </p><p>5. that good actions will be seen, and will lead people to honor God. If we have no other way of doing good - if we are poor, and unlearned, and unknown yet we may do good by our lives. No sincere and humble Christian lives in vain. The feeblest light at midnight is of use.
 </p><p>"How far the little candle throws his beams!
 </p><p>So shines a good deed in a naughty world!"

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">mat 5:17</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Think not that I am come ... - Our Saviour was just entering on his work. It was important for him to state what he came to do. By his setting up to be a teacher in opposition to the scribes and Pharisees, some might charge him with an intention to destroy their law, and to abolish the customs of the nation. He therefore told them that he did not come for that end, but really to fulfill or accomplish what was in the law and the prophets.
 </p><p>To destroy - To abrogate; to deny their divine authority; to set people free from the obligation to obey them. "The law." The five books of Moses called the law. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk024.htm#044">Luk 24:44</a>.
 </p><p>The Prophets - The books which the prophets wrote. These two divisions here seem to comprehend the Old Testament, and Jesus says that he came not to do away or destroy the authority of the Old Testament.
 </p><p>But to fulfil - To complete the design; to fill up what was predicted; to accomplish what was intended in them. The word "fulfill" also means sometimes "to teach" or "to inculcate," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col001.htm#025">Col 1:25</a>. The law of Moses contained many sacrifices and rites which were designed to shadow forth the Messiah. See the notes at Heb. 9. These were fulfilled when he came and offered himself a sacrifice to God,
 </p><p>"A sacrifice of nobler name.
 </p><p>And richer blood than they."
 </p><p>The prophets contained many predictions respecting his coming and death. These were all to be fulfilled and fully accomplished by his life and his sufferings. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#018">Matthew 5:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">mat 5:18</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Verily - Truly, certainly. A word of strong affirmation.
 </p><p>Till heaven and earth pass - This expression denotes that the law never would be destroyed until it should be all fulfilled. It is the same as saying everything else may change; the very earth and heaven may pass away, but the law of God shall not be destroyed until its whole design has been accomplished.
 </p><p>One jot - The word "jot," or yod (י  y), is the name of the Hebrew letter I, the smallest letter in the Hebrew alphabet.
 </p><p>One tittle - The word used here, in the Greek, means literally a little horn, then a point, an extremity. Several of the Hebrew letters were written with small points or apices, as in the Hebrew letter, shin (שׁ  sh), or the Hebrew letter, sin (שׂ  s), which serve to distinguish one letter from another. To change a small point of one letter, therefore, might vary the meaning of a word, and destroy the sense. The name "little horn" was given to these points probably from the manner in which they were written, resembling a little horn. Professor Hackett says of a manuscript which he saw a Jew transcribing: "One peculiarity, that struck me at once as I cast my eye over the parchment, was the horn-like appearance attached to some of the letters. I had seen the same mark, before this, in Hebrew manuscripts, but never where it was so prominent as here. The sign in question, as connected with the Hebrew Letter Lamedh (ל  L) in particular, had almost the appearance of an intentional imitation of a ram's head. It was to that appendage of the Hebrew letters that the Saviour referred when he said, "'Not one jot or little horn' (as the Greek term signifies, which our version renders 'tittle,') 'shall pass from the law until all be fulfilled.'" - Illustrations of Scripture, p. 234. Hence, the Jews were exceedingly cautious in writing these letters, and considered the smallest change or omission a reason for destroying the whole manuscript when they were transcribing the Old Testament. The expression, "one jot or tittle," became proverbial, and means that the smallest part of the law should not be destroyed.
 </p><p>The laws of the Jews are commonly divided into moral, ceremonial, and judicial. The moral laws are such as grow out of the nature of things, and which cannot, therefore, be changed - such as the duty of loving God and his creatures. These cannot be abolished, as it can never be made right to hate God, or to hate our fellow-men. Of this kind are the ten commandments, and these our Saviour has neither abolished nor superseded. The ceremonial laws are such as are appointed to meet certain states of society, or to regulate the religious rites and ceremonies of a people. These can be changed when circumstances are changed, and yet the moral law be untouched. A general in an army may command his soldiers to appear sometimes in a red coat and sometimes in blue or in yellow. This would be a ceremonial law, and might be changed as he pleased. The duty of obeying him, and of being faithful to his country, could not be changed.
 </p><p>This is a moral law. A parent might permit his children to have 50 different dresses at different times, and love them equally in all. The dress is a mere matter of ceremony, and may be changed. The child, in all these garments, is bound to love and obey his father. This is a moral law, and cannot be changed. So the laws of the Jews. Those designed to regulate mere matters of ceremony and rites of worship might be changed. Those requiring love and obedience to God and love to people could not be changed, and Christ did not attempt it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat019.htm#019">Mat 19:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat022.htm#037">Mat 22:37-39</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#027">Luk 10:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom013.htm#009">Rom 13:9</a>. A third species of law was the judicial, or those laws regulating courts of justice which are contained in the Old Testament. These were of the nature of the ceremonial law, and might also be changed at pleasure. The judicial law of the Hebrews was adapted to their own civil society. When the form of their polity was changed this was of course no longer binding. The ceremonial law was fulfilled by the coming of Christ: the shadow was lost in the substance, and ceased to be binding. The moral law was confirmed and unchanged. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#019">Matthew 5:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">mat 5:19</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Whosoever therefore shall break - Shall violate or disobey.
 </p><p>One of these least commandments - The Pharisees, it is probable, divided the precepts of the law into lesser and greater, teaching that they who violated the former were guilty of a trivial offence only. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023">Mat 23:23</a>. Christ teaches that in his kingdom they who make this distinction, or who taught that any laws of God might be violated with impunity, should be called least; while they should be held in high regard who observed all the laws of God without distinction.
 </p><p>Shall be called least - That is, shall be least. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#009">Mat 5:9</a>. The meaning of this passage seems to be this: in the kingdom of heaven, that is, in the kingdom of the Messiah, or in the church which he is about to establish (see the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002">Mat 3:2</a>), he that breaks the least of these commandments shall be in no esteem, or shall not be regarded as a proper religious teacher. The Pharisees, by dividing the law into greater and lesser precepts, made no small part of it void by their traditions and divisions, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#023">Mat 23:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat015.htm#003">Mat 15:3-6</a>. Jesus says that in his kingdom all this vain division and tradition would cease. Such divisions and distinctions would be a small matter. He that attempted it should be the least of all. People would be engaged in yielding obedience to all the law of God without any such vain distinctions.
 </p><p>Shall be called great - He that teaches that all the law of God is binding, and that the whole of it should be obeyed, without attempting to specify what is most important, shall be a teacher worthy of his office, and shall be called great. Hence, we learn:
 </p><p>1. that all the law of God is binding on Christians. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jam002.htm#010">Jam 2:10</a>.
 </p><p>2. that all the commands of God should be preached, in their proper place, by Christian ministers.
 </p><p>3. that they who pretend that there are any laws of God so small that they need not obey them, are unworthy of his kingdom. And,
 </p><p>4. that true piety has respect to all the commandments of God. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa119.htm#006">Psa 119:6</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#020">Matthew 5:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">mat 5:20</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Your righteousness - Your holiness; your views of the nature of righteousness, and your conduct and lives. Unless you are more holy than they are, you cannot be saved.
 </p><p>Shall exceed - Shall excel, or abound more. The righteousness of true Christians is seated in the heart, and is therefore genuine. Jesus means that unless they had more real holiness of character than the scribes and Pharisees, they could not be saved.
 </p><p>The righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#007">Mat 3:7</a>. Their righteousness consisted in outward observances of the ceremonial and traditional law. They offered sacrifices, fasted often. prayed much, were punctilious about ablutions, and tithes, and the ceremonies of religion, but neglected justice, truth, purity, and holiness of heart. See Mat. 23:13-33. The righteousness that Jesus required in his kingdom was purity, chastity, honesty, temperance, the fear of God, and the love of man. It is pure, eternal, reaching the motives, and making the life holy.
 </p><p>The kingdom of heaven - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#002">Mat 3:2</a>. Shall not be a suitable subject of his kingdom here, or saved in the world to come. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021">Matthew 5:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">mat 5:21</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Ye have heard - Or, this is the common interpretation among the Jews. Jesus proceeds here to comment on some prevailing opinions among the Jews; to show that the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees was defective; and that people needed a better righteousness, or they could not be saved. He illustrates what he meant by that better righteousness by showing that the common opinions of the scribes were erroneous.
 </p><p>By them of old time - This might be translated to the ancients, referring to Moses and the prophets. But it is more probable that Jesus here refers to the interpreters of the law and the prophets. He did not set himself against the law of Moses, but against the false and pernicious interpretations of the law prevalent in his time.
 </p><p>Thou shalt not kill - See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo020.htm#013">Exo 20:13</a>. This properly denotes taking the life of another with malice, or with an intention to murder him. The Jews understood it as meaning no more. The comment of our Saviour shows that it was spiritual, and was designed to extend to the thoughts and feelings as well as the external act.
 </p><p>Shall be in danger of - Shall be held guilty, and be punished by. The law of Moses declared that the murderer should be put to death, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#021">Lev 24:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num035.htm#016">Num 35:16</a>. It did not say, however, by whom this should be done, and it was left to the Jews to organize courts to have cognizance of such crimes, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu016.htm#018">Deu 16:18</a>.
 </p><p>The judgment - This was the tribunal that had cognizance of cases of murder, etc. It was a court that sat in each city or town, and consisted commonly of seven members. It was the lowest court among the Jews, and from it an appeal might be taken to the Sanhedrin. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022">Matthew 5:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">mat 5:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But I say unto you - Jesus being God as well as man <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#001">Joh 1:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#014">Joh 1:14</a>, and therefore, being the original giver of the law, had a right to expound it or change it as he pleased. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#006">Mat 12:6</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#008">Mat 12:8</a>. He therefore spoke here and elsewhere as having authority, and not as the scribes. It may be added here that no mere man ever spake as Jesus did, when explaining or enforcing the law. He did it as having a right to do it; and he that has a right to ordain and change laws in the government of God must be himself divine.
 </p><p>Is angry with His brother without a cause - Anger, or that feeling which we have when we are injured, and which prompts us to defend ourselves when in danger, is a natural feeling, given to us:
 </p><p>1. As a proper expression of our disapprobation of a course of evil conduct; and
 </p><p>2. That we may defend ourselves when suddenly attacked.
 </p><p>When excited against sin, it is lawful. God is angry with the wicked, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa007.htm#011">Psa 7:11</a>. Jesus looked on the hypocritical Pharisees with anger, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar003.htm#005">Mar 3:5</a>. So it is said, "Be ye angry, and sin not, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph004.htm#026">Eph 4:26</a>. This anger, or indignation against sin, is not what our Saviour speaks of here. What he condemns here is anger without a cause; that is, unjustly, rashly, hastily, where no offence has been given or intended. In that case it is evil; and it is a violation of the sixth commandment, because "he that hateth his brother, is a murderer," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1003.htm#015">Jo1 3:15</a>. He has a feeling which would lead him to commit murder, if it were fully acted out. The word "brother" here refers not merely to one to whom we are nearly related, having the same parent or parents, as the word is commonly used, but includes also a neighbor, or perhaps anyone with whom we may be associated. As all people are descended from one Father and are all the creatures of the same God, so they are all brethren: and so every man should be regarded and treated as a brother, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb011.htm#016">Heb 11:16</a>.
 </p><p>Raca - This is a Syriac word, expressive of great contempt. It comes from a verb signifying to be empty, vain; and hence, as a word of contempt, denotes senseless, stupid, shallow-brains. Jesus teaches here that to use such words is a violation of the spirit of the sixth commandment, and if indulged, may lead to a more open and dreadful infraction of that law. Children should learn that to use such words is highly offensive to God, for we must give an account for every idle word which we speak in the day of judgment, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#036">Mat 12:36</a>.
 </p><p>In danger of the council - The word translated "council" is in the original Sanhedrin, and there can be no doubt that the Saviour refers to the Jewish tribunal of that name. This was instituted in the time of the Maccabees, probably about 200 years before Christ. It was composed of 72 judges: the high priest was the president of this tribunal. The 72 members were made up of the chief priests and elders of the people and the scribes. The chief priests were such as had discharged the office of the high priest, and those who were the heads of the twenty-four classes of priests, who were called in an honorary way high or chief priests. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#004">Mat 2:4</a>. The elders were the princes of the tribes or heads of the family associations. It is not to be supposed that all the elders had a right to a seat here, but such only as were elected to the office. The scribes were learned people of the nation elected to this tribunal, being neither of the rank of priests or elders. This tribunal had cognizance of the great affairs of the nation. Until the time when Judea was subjected to the Romans, it had the power of life and death. It still retained the power of passing sentence, though the Roman magistrate held the right of execution. It usually sat in Jerusalem, in a room near the temple. It was before this tribunal that our Saviour was tried. It was then assembled in the palace of the high priest, Mat. 26:3-57; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#024">Joh 18:24</a>.
 </p><p>Thou fool - This term expressed more than want of wisdom. It was expressive of the highest guilt. It had been commonly used to denote those who were idolaters <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu022.htm#021">Deu 22:21</a>, and also one who is guilty of great crimes, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos007.htm#015">Jos 7:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa014.htm#001">Psa 14:1</a>.
 </p><p>Hell fire - The original of this is "the gehennah of fire." The word gehenna, γέεννα  geenna, commonly translated "hell," is made up of two Hebrew words, and signifies the valley of Hinnom. This was formerly a pleasant valley near to Jerusalem, on the south. A small brook or torrent usually ran through it and partly encompassed the city. This valley the idolatrous Israelites devoted formerly to the horrid worship of Moloch, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2016.htm#003">Kg2 16:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2028.htm#003">Ch2 28:3</a>. In that worship, the ancient Jewish writers inform us, the idol of Moloch was of brass, adorned with a royal crown, having the head of a calf, and his arms extended as if to embrace anyone. When they offered children to him they heated the statue within by a great fire, and when it was burning hot they put the miserable child into his arms, where it was soon consumed by the heat; and, in order that the cries of the child might not be heard, they made a great noise with drums and other instruments about the idol. These drums were called תּף  toph, and hence a common name of the place was Tophet, תּפת  Tophet, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer007.htm#031">Jer 7:31-32</a>.
 </p><p>After the return of the Jews from captivity, this place was held in such abhorrence that, by the example of Josiah <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2023.htm#010">Kg2 23:10</a>, it was made the place where to throw all the dead carcasses and filth of the city, and was not unfrequently the place of public executions. It became, therefore, extremely offensive; the sight was terrific; the air was polluted and pestilential; and to preserve it in any manner pure, it was necessary to keep fires continually burning there. The extreme loathsomeness of the place; the filth and putrefaction; the corruption of the atmosphere, and the lurid fires blazing by day and night, made it one of the most appalling and terrific objects with which a Jew was acquainted. It was called the gehenna of fire, and was the image which our Saviour often employed to denote the future punishment of the wicked.
 </p><p>In this verse it denotes a degree of suffering higher than the punishment inflicted by the "court of seventy," or the Sanhedrin, and the whole verse may therefore mean, "He that hates his brother without a cause is guilty of a violation of the sixth commandment, and shall be punished with a severity similar to that inflicted by the court of judgment. He that shall suffer his passions to transport him still further, so that he shall make his brother an object of derision and contempt, shall be exposed to severer punishment, corresponding to that which the Sanhedrin (council) inflicts. But he who shall load his brother with odious appellations and abusive language shall incur the severest degree of punishment, represented by being burned alive in the horrid and awful valley of Hinnom."
 </p><p>The amount, then, of this difficult and important verse is this: The Jews considered but one crime a violation of the sixth commandment, namely, actual murder, or willful, unlawful taking life. Jesus says that the commandment is much broader. It relates not only to the external act, but to the feelings and words. He specifies three forms of such violation:
 </p><p>1. Unjust anger.
 </p><p>2. Anger accompanied with an expression of contempt.
 </p><p>3. Anger, with an expression not only of contempt, but wickedness.
 </p><p>Among the Jews there were three degrees of condemnation: that by the "judgment," the "council," and the "fire of Hinnom." Jesus says likewise there shall be grades of condemnation for the different ways of violating the sixth commandment. Not only murder shall be punished by God, but anger and contempt shall be regarded by him as a violation of the law, and punished according to the offence. As these offences were not actually cognizable before the Jewish tribunals, he must mean that they will be punished hereafter, and all these expressions therefore relate to degrees of punishment proportionate to crime in the future world - the world of justice and of woe.

 <p>Therefore, if thou bring thy gift to the altar ... - The Pharisees were intent only on the external act in worship. They looked not at all to the internal state of the mind. If a man conformed to the external rites of religion, however much envy, and malice, and secret hatred he might have, they thought he was doing well. Our Saviour taught a different doctrine. It was of more consequence to have the heart right than to perform the outward act. If, therefore, says he, a man has gone so far as to bring his gift to the very altar, and should remember that anyone had anything against him, it was his duty there to leave his offering and go and be reconciled. While a difference of this nature existed, his offering could not be acceptable. He was not to wait until the offended brother should come to him; he was to go and seek him out, and be reconciled. So now the worship of God will not be acceptable, however well performed externally, until we are at peace with those that we have injured. "To obey is better than sacrifice," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1015.htm#022">Sa1 15:22</a>. He that comes to worship his Maker filled with malice, and hatred, and envy, and at war with his brethren, is a hypocritical worshipper, and must meet with God's displeasure. God is not deceived, and he will not be mocked.
 </p><p>Thy gift - Thy sacrifice. What thou art about to devote to God as an offering.
 </p><p>To the altar - The altar was situated in front of the temple, and was the place on which sacrifices were made. See the notes on plan, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012">Mat 21:12</a>. To bring a gift to the altar was expressive of worshipping God, for this was the way in which he was formerly worshipped.
 </p><p>Thy brother - Any man, especially any fellow-worshipper. Anyone of the same religious society.
 </p><p>Hath aught - Is offended, or thinks he has been injured by you in any manner.
 </p><p>First be reconciled - This means to settle the difficulty; to make proper acknowledgment or satisfaction for the injury. If you have wronged him, make restitution. If you owe him a debt which ought to be paid, pay it. If you have injured his character, confess it and seek pardon. If he is under an erroneous impression, if your conduct has been such as to lead him to suspect that you have injured him, make an explanation. Do all in your power; and all you ought to do, to have the matter settled. From this we learn:
 </p><p>1. That, in order to worship God acceptably, we must do justice to our fellow-men.
 </p><p>2. Our worship will not be acceptable unless we do all we can to live peaceably with others.
 </p><p>3. It is our duty to seek reconciliation with others when we have injured them.
 </p><p>4. This should be done before we attempt to worship God.
 </p><p>5. This is often the reason why God does not accept our offerings, and we go empty away from our devotions. We do not do what we ought to others; we cherish improper feelings or refuse to make proper acknowledgments, and God will not accept such attempts to worship him.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">mat 5:25</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Agree with thine adversary quickly - This is still an illustration of the sixth commandment. To be in hostility, to go to law, to be litigious, is a violation always, on one side or the other, of the law requiring us to love our neighbor, and our Saviour regards it as a violation of the sixth commandment. While you are in the way with him, says he, that is, while you are going to the court, before the trial has taken place, it is your duty, if possible, to come to an agreement. It is wrong to carry the contention to a court of law. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1006.htm#006">Co1 6:6-7</a>. The consequence of not being reconciled, he expresses in the language of courts. The adversary shall deliver to the judge, and he to the executioner, and he shall throw you into prison. He did not mean to say that this would be literally the way with God, but that His dealings with those that harbored these feelings, and would not be reconciled with their brethren, were represented by the punishment inflicted by human tribunals. That is, he would hold all such as violators of the sixth commandment, and would punish them accordingly.
 </p><p>There is no propriety in the use sometimes made of this verse, in representing God as the "adversary" of the sinner, and urging him to be reconciled to God while in the way to judgment. Nor does the phrase "thou shalt by no means come out thence until thou hast paid the uttermost farthing" refer to the eternity of future punishment. It is language taken from courts of justice, to illustrate the truth that God will punish people according to justice for not being reconciled to him. The punishment in the future world will be eternal indeed <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#046">Mat 25:46</a>, but this passage does not prove it.
 </p><p>Thine adversary - A man that is opposed to us in law. It here means a creditor; a man who has a just claim on us.
 </p><p>In the way with him - While you are going before the court. Before the trial comes on. It is remarkable that this very direction is found in the Roman law of the Twelve Tables, which expressly directed the plaintiff and defendant to make up the matter while they were in the way, or going to the praetor - in via, rem uti pacunt orato. - Blackstone's Commentary, iii. p. 299. Whether the Saviour had any reference to this cannot be determined. As the Roman laws prevailed to some extent in Palestine, however, it is possible that there was such an allusion.
 </p><p>The officer - The executioner; or, as we should say, the sheriff.
 </p><p>The uttermost farthing - The last farthing. All that is due. The farthing was a small coin used in Judea, equal to two mites. It was not quite equal to half a farthing of British money.

 <p>Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#021">Mat 5:21</a>. Our Saviour in these verses explains the seventh commandment. It is probable that the Pharisees had explained this commandment, as they had the sixth, as extending only to the external act; and that they regarded evil thoughts and a wanton imagination as of little consequence, or as not forbidden by the law. Our Saviour assures them that the commandment did not regard the external act merely, but the secrets of the heart, and the movements of the eye. He declares that they who indulge a wanton desire, that they who look on a woman to increase their lust, have already, in the sight of God, violated the commandment, and committed adultery in the heart. Such was the guilt of David, whose deep and awful crime fully shows the danger of indulging in evil desires, and in the rovings of a wanton eye. See 2 Sam. 11; Ps. 51. See also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014">Pe2 2:14</a>. So exceeding strict and broad is the law of God! And so heinous in his sight axe thoughts and feelings which may be forever concealed from the world! 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#029">Matthew 5:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">mat 5:29</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Thy right eye - The Hebrews, like others, were accustomed to represent the affections of the mind by the members or parts of the body, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom007.htm#023">Rom 7:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom006.htm#013">Rom 6:13</a>. Thus, the bowels denoted compassion; the heart, affection or feeling; the reins, understanding, secret purpose. An evil eye denotes sometimes envy <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#015">Mat 20:15</a>, and sometimes an evil passion, or sin in general. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar007.htm#021">Mar 7:21-22</a>; "out of the heart proceedeth an evil eye." In this place, as in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe2002.htm#014">Pe2 2:14</a>, the expression is used to denote strong adulterous passion, unlawful desire, or wicked inclination. The right eye and hand are mentioned, because they are of most use to us, and denote that, however strong the passion may be, or difficult to part with, yet that we should do it.
 </p><p>Offend thee - The noun from which the verb "offend," in the original, is derived, commonly means a stumbling-block, or a stone placed in the way, over which one might fall. It also means a net, or a certain part of a net against which, if a bird strikes, it springs the net, and is taken. It comes to signify, therefore, anything by which we fall, or are ensnared; and applied to morals, means anything by which we fall into sin, or by which we are ensnared. The English word "offend" means now, commonly, to displease; to make angry; to affront. This is by no means the sense of the word in Scripture. It means to cause to fall into sin. The eye does this when it wantonly looks upon a woman to lust after her.
 </p><p>Pluck it out ... - It cannot be supposed that Christ intended this to be taken literally. His design was to teach that the dearest objects, if they cause us to sin, are to be abandoned; that by all sacrifices and self-denials we must overcome the evil propensities of our nature, and resist our wanton imaginations. Some of the fathers, however, took this commandment literally. Our Saviour several times repeated this sentiment. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat018.htm#009">Mat 18:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#043">Mar 9:43-47</a>. Compare also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/col003.htm#005">Col 3:5</a>.
 </p><p>It is profitable for thee - It is better for thee. You will have gained by it.
 </p><p>One of thy members perish - It is better to deny yourself the gratification of an evil passion here, however much it may cost you, than to go down to hell forever.
 </p><p>Thy whole body should be cast into hell - Thy body, with all its unsubdued and vicious propensities. This will constitute no small part of the misery of hell. The sinner will be sent there as he is, with every evil desire, every unsubdued propensity, every wicked and troublesome passion, and yet with no possibility of gratification. It constitutes our highest notions of misery when we think of a man filled with anger, pride, malice, avarice, envy and lust, and with no opportunity of gratifying them forever. This is all that is necessary to make an eternal hell. On the word hell, see the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#022">Mat 5:22</a>.

 <p>And if thy right hand offend thee - The right hand is selected for the same reason as the right eye, because it is one of the most important members of the human body. The idea is, that the dearest earthly objects are to be sacrificed rather than that we should commit sin; that the most rigid self-denial should be practiced, and that the most absolute self-government should be maintained at any sacrifice, rather than that we should suffer the mind to be polluted by unholy thoughts and impure desires. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#031">Matthew 5:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">mat 5:31</a></font></span></p>
 <p>It hath been said ... - That is, by Moses, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu024.htm#001">Deu 24:1-2</a>. The husband was directed, if he put his wife away, to give her a bill of divorce, that is a certificate of the fact she had been his wife, and that he had dissolved the marriage. There was considerable difference of opinion among the Jews for what causes the husband was permitted to do this. One of their famous schools maintained that it might be done for any cause, however trivial. The other maintained that adultery only could justify it. The truth was, however, that the husband exercised this right at pleasure; that he was judge in the case, and dismissed his wife when and for what cause he chose. And this seems to be agreeable to the law in Deuteronomy. Our Saviour in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar010.htm#001">Mar 10:1-12</a>, says that this was permitted on account of the hardness of their hearts, but that in the beginning it was not so. God made a single pair, and ordained marriage for life. But Moses found the people so much hardened; so long accustomed to the practice, and so rebellious, that, as a matter of civil appointment, he thought it best not to attempt any change. Our Saviour brought marriage back to its original intention, and declared that whosoever put away his wife henceforward, except for one offence, should be guilty of adultery. This is now the law of God. This was the original institution. This is the only law that is productive of peace and good morals, and that secures the respect due to a wife, and the good of children. Nor has any man or set of men - any legislature or any court, civil or ecclesiastical - a right to interfere, and declare that divorces may be granted for any other cause. They, therefore, whoever they may be, who are divorced for any cause except the single one of adultery, if they marry again, are, according to the Scriptures, living in adultery. No earthly laws can trample down the laws of God, or make that right which he has solemnly pronounced wrong.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">mat 5:33</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Thou shalt not forswear thyself - Christ here proceeds to correct another false interpretation of the law. The law respecting oaths is found in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#012">Lev 19:12</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu023.htm#023">Deu 23:23</a>. By those laws people were forbid to perjure themselves, or to forswear, that is, swear falsely.
 </p><p>Perform unto the Lord - Perform literally, really, and religiously what is promised in an oath.
 </p><p>Thine oaths - An oath is a solemn affirmation or declaration, made with an appeal to God for the truth of what is affirmed, and imprecating his vengeance, and renouncing his favor if what is affirmed is false. A false oath is called perjury, or, as in this place, forswearing.
 </p><p>It appears, however, from this passage, as well as from the ancient writings of the Jewish rabbins, that while the Jews professedly adhered to the law, they had introduced a number of oaths in common conversation, and oaths which they by no means considered to be binding. For example, they would swear by the temple, by the head, by heaven, by the earth. So long as they kept from swearing by the name Yahweh, and so long as they observed the oaths publicly taken, they seemed to consider all others as allowable, and allowedly broken. This is the abuse which Christ wished to correct. "It was the practice of swearing in common conversation, and especially swearing by created things." To do this, he said that they were mistaken in their views of the sacredness of such oaths. They were very closely connected with God; and to trifle with them was a species of trifling with God. Heaven is his throne; the earth his footstool; Jerusalem his special abode; the head was made by him, and was so much under his control that we could not make one hair white or black. To swear by these things, therefore, was to treat irreverently objects created by God, and could not be without guilt. It is remarkable that the sin here condemned by the Saviour prevails still in Palestine in the same form and manner referred to here. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book, vol. ii. p. 284) says, "The people now use the very same sort of oaths that are mentioned and condemned by our Lord. They swear by the head, by their life, by heaven, and by the temple, or what is in its place, the church. The forms of cursing and swearing, however, are almost infinite, and fall on the pained ear all day long."
 </p><p>Our Saviour here evidently had no reference to judicial oaths, or oaths taken in a court of justice. It was merely the foolish and wicked habit of swearing in private conversation; of swearing on every occasion and by everything that he condemned. This he does condemn in a most unqualified manner. He himself, however, did not refuse to take an oath in a court of law, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#063">Mat 26:63-64</a>. So Paul often called God to witness his sincerity, which is all that is meant by an oath. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom001.htm#009">Rom 1:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#001">Rom 9:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gal001.htm#020">Gal 1:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb006.htm#016">Heb 6:16</a>. Oaths were, moreover, prescribed in the law of Moses, and Christ did not come to repeal those laws. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo022.htm#011">Exo 22:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev005.htm#001">Lev 5:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num005.htm#019">Num 5:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#012">Deu 29:12</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu029.htm#014">Deu 29:14</a>.

 <p>But I say unto you, Swear not at all - That is, in the manner which he proceeds to specify. Swear not in any of the common and profane ways customary at that time.
 </p><p>By heaven; for it is God's throne - To swear by that was, if it meant anything, to swear by Him that sitteth thereon, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#022">Mat 23:22</a>.
 </p><p>Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool - Swearing by that, therefore, is really swearing by God. Or perhaps it means:
 </p><p>1. that we have no right to pledge, or swear by, what belongs to God; and,
 </p><p>2. that oaths by inanimate objects are unmeaningful and wicked.
 </p><p>If they are real oaths, they are by a living Being, who has power to take vengeance. A footstool is that on which the feet rest when sitting. The term is applied to the earth to denote how lowly and humble an object it is when compared with God.
 </p><p>Jerusalem - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#001">Mat 2:1</a>.
 </p><p>City of the Great King - That is, of God; called the Great King because he was the King of the Israelites, and Jerusalem was the capital of the nation, and the place where he was especially honored as king. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa046.htm#004">Psa 46:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa048.htm#001">Psa 48:1-2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa087.htm#003">Psa 87:3</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">mat 5:36</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Neither shalt thou swear by thy head - This was a common oath. The Gentiles also used this oath. To swear by the head was the same as to swear by the life; or to say, I will forfeit my life if what I say is not true. God is the Author of the life, and to swear by that, therefore, is the same as to swear by him.
 </p><p>Because thou canst not make one hair white or black - You have no control or right over your own life. You cannot even change one single hair. God has all that control; and it is therefore improper and profane to pledge what is God's gift and God's property; and it is the same as swearing by God himself. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#037">Matthew 5:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">mat 5:37</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But let your communication - Your word; what you say.
 </p><p>Be, Yea - Yes. This does not mean that we should always use the word "yea," for it might as well have been translated "yes"; but it means that we should simply affirm or declare that a thing is so.
 </p><p>More than these - More than these affirmations.
 </p><p>Cometh of evil - Is evil. Proceeds from some evil disposition or purpose. And from this we may learn:
 </p><p>1. That profane swearing is always the evidence of a depraved heart. To trifle with the name of God, or with any of his works, is itself most decided proof of depravity.
 </p><p>2. That no man is believed any sooner in common conversation because he swears to a thing. When we hear a man swear to a thing, it is pretty good evidence that he knows what he is saying to be false, and we should be on our guard. He that will break the third commandment will not hesitate to break the ninth also. And this explains the fact that profane swearers are seldom believed. The man who is always believed is he whose character is beyond suspicion in all things, who obeys all the laws of God, and whose simple declaration, therefore, is enough. A man that is truly a Christian, and leads a Christian life, does not need oaths and profaneness to make him believed.
 </p><p>3. It is no mark of a gentleman to swear. The most worthless and vile. the refuse of mankind, the drunkard and the prostitute, swear as well as the best dressed and educated gentleman. No particular endowments are requisite to give finish to the art of cursing. The basest and meanest of mankind swear with as much tact and skill as the most refined, and he that wishes to degrade himself to the very lowest level of pollution and shame should learn to be a common swearer. Any person has talents enough to learn to curse God and his fellowmen, and to pray - for every man who swears prays - that God would sink him and others into hell. No profane person knows but that God will hear his prayer, and send him to the regions of woe.
 </p><p>4. Profaneness does no one any good. Nobody is the richer, or wiser, or happier for it. It helps no one's morals or manners. It commends no one to any society. The profane man must be, of course, shut out from female society, and no refined conversation can consist with it. It is disgusting to the refined; abominable to the good; insulting to those with whom we associate; degrading to the mind; unprofitable, needless, and injurious in society; and awful in the sight of God.
 </p><p>5. God will not hold the profane swearer guiltless. Wantonly to profane His name, to call His vengeance down, to curse Him on His throne, to invoke damnation, is perhaps of all offences the most awful. And there is not in the universe more cause of amazement at His forbearance, than that God does not rise in vengeance, and smite the profane swearer at once to hell. Verily, in a world like this, where His name is profaned every day, and hour, and moment by thousands, God shows that He is slow to anger, and that His mercy is without bounds! 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#038">Matthew 5:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">mat 5:38</a></font></span></p>
 <p>An eye for an eye ... - This command is found in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo021.htm#024">Exo 21:24</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev024.htm#020">Lev 24:20</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu019.htm#021">Deu 19:21</a>. In these places it was given as a rule to regulate the decisions of judges. They were to take eye for eye, and tooth for tooth, and to inflict burning for burning. As a judicial rule it is not unjust. Christ finds no fault with the rule as applied to magistrates, and does not take upon himself to repeal it. But instead of confining it to magistrates, the Jews had extended it to private conduct, and made it the rule by which to take revenge. They considered themselves justified by this rule to inflict the same injury on others that they had received. Our Saviour remonstrates against this. He declares that the law had no reference to private revenge, that it was given only to regulate the magistrate, and that their private conduct was to be governed by different principles.
 </p><p>The general principle which he laid down was, that we are not to resist evil; that is, as it is in the Greek, nor to set ourselves against an evil person who is injuring us. But even this general direction is not to be pressed too strictly. Christ did not intend to teach that we are to see our families murdered, or be murdered ourselves; rather than to make resistance. The law of nature, and all laws, human and divine, justify self-defense when life is in danger. It cannot surely be the intention to teach that a father should sit by coolly and see his family butchered by savages, and not be allowed to defend them. Neither natural nor revealed religion ever did, or ever can, inculcate this doctrine. Our Saviour immediately explains what he means by it. Had he intended to refer it to a case where life is in danger, he would most surely have mentioned it. Such a case was far more worthy of statement than those which he did mention.
 </p><p>A doctrine so unusual, so unlike all that the world had believed. and that the best people had acted on, deserved to be formally stated. Instead of doing this, however, he confines himself to smaller matters, to things of comparatively trivial interest, and says that in these we had better take wrong than to enter into strife and lawsuits. The first case is where we are smitten on the cheek. Rather than contend and fight, we should take it patiently, and turn the other cheek. This does not, however, prevent our remonstrating firmly yet mildly on the injustice of the thing, and insisting that justice should be done us, as is evident from the example of the Saviour himself. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh018.htm#023">Joh 18:23</a>. The second evil mentioned is where a man is litigious and determined to take all the advantage the law can give him, following us with vexatious and expensive lawsuits. Our Saviour directs us, rather than to imitate him rather than to contend with a revengeful spirit in courts of justice to take a trifling injury, and yield to him. This is merely a question about property, and not about conscience and life.
 </p><p>Coat - The Jews wore two principal garments, an interior and an exterior. The interior, here called the "coat," or the tunic, was made commonly of linen, and encircled the whole body, extending down to the knees. Sometimes beneath this garment, as in the case of the priests, there was another garment corresponding to pantaloons. The coat, or tunic, was extended to the neck. and had long or short sleeves. Over this was commonly worn an upper garment, here called "cloak," or mantle. It was made commonly nearly square, of different sizes, 5 or 6 cubits long and as many broad, and was wrapped around the body, and was thrown off when labor was performed. If, said Christ, an adversary wished to obtain, at law, one of these garments, rather than contend with him let him have the other also. A reference to various articles of apparel occurs frequently in the New Testament, and it is desirable to have a correct view of the ancient mode of dress. in order to a proper understanding of the Bible. The Asiatic modes of dress are nearly the same from age to age, and hence it is not difficult to illustrate the passages where such a reference occurs. The ordinary dress consisted of the inner garment, the outer garment, the girdle (belt), and the sandals. In regard to the sandals, see the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#011">Mat 3:11</a>.
 </p><p>In the girdle (belt) was the place of the pouch <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat010.htm#009">Mat 10:9</a>, and to it the sword and dirk were commonly attached. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa2020.htm#008">Sa2 20:8</a>. In modern times the pistols are also fastened to the belt. It is the usual place for the handkerchief, smoking materials, inkhorn, and, in general, the implements of one's profession. The belt served to confine the loose-flowing robe or outer garment to the body. It held the garment when it was tucked up, as it was usually in walking or in labor. Hence, "to gird up the loins" became a significant figurative expression, denoting readiness for service, activity, labor, and watchfulness; and "to loosen the loins" denoted the giving way to repose and indolence, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#029">Kg2 4:29</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job038.htm#003">Job 38:3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa005.htm#027">Isa 5:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk012.htm#035">Luk 12:35</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#007">Joh 21:7</a>.
 </p><p>Whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile - The word translated "shall compel" is of Persian origin. Post-offices were then unknown. In order that the royal commands might be delivered with safety and despatch in different parts of the empire, Cyrus stationed horsemen at proper intervals on all the great public highways. One of those delivered the message to another, and intelligence was thus rapidly and safely communicated. These heralds were permitted to compel any person, or to press any horse, boat, ship, or other vehicle that they might need for the quick transmission of the king's commandments. It was to this custom that our Saviour refers. Rather, says he, than resist a public authority requiring your attendance and aid for a certain distance, go peaceably twice the distance.
 </p><p>A mile - A Roman mile was 1,000 paces.
 </p><p>Twain - Two.

 <p>Give to him that asketh thee - This is the general rule. It is better to give sometimes to an undeserving person than to turn away one who is really in need. It is good to be in the habit of giving. At the same time, the rule must be interpreted so as to be consistent with our duty to our families <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1005.htm#008">Ti1 5:8</a> and with other objects of justice and charity. It is seldom, perhaps never, good to give to a person who is able to work, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th2003.htm#010">Th2 3:10</a>. To give to such is to encourage laziness, and to support the idle at the expense of the industrious. If such a one is indeed hungry, feed him; if he needs anything further, give him employment. If a widow, an orphan, a man of misfortune, or an infirmed man, lame, or sick, is at your door, never send any of them away empty. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb013.htm#002">Heb 13:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat025.htm#035">Mat 25:35-45</a>. So this is true of a poor and needy friend that wishes to borrow. We are not to turn away or deny him. This deserves, however, some limitation. It must be done in consistency with other duties. To lend to every worthless man would be to throw away our property, encourage laziness and crime, and ruin our own families. It should be done consistently with every other obligation, and of this everyone is to be the judge. Perhaps our Saviour meant to teach that where there was a deserving friend or brother in need, we should lend to him without usury, and without standing much about the security.

 <p>Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor, and hate thine enemy - The command to love our neighbor was a law of God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lev019.htm#018">Lev 19:18</a>. That we must therefore hate our enemy was an inference drawn from it by the Jews. They supposed that if we loved the one, we must of course hate the other. They were total strangers to that great, special law of religion which requires us to love both. A neighbor is literally one that lives near to us; then, one who is near to us by acts of kindness and friendship. This is its meaning here. See also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#036">Luk 10:36</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#044">Matthew 5:44</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_044">mat 5:44</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Love your enemies - There are two kinds of love, involving the same general feeling, or springing from the same fountain of good-will to all mankind, but differing so far as to admit of separation in idea. The one is that feeling by which we approve of the conduct of another, commonly called the love of complacency; the other, that by which we wish well to the person of another, though we cannot approve his conduct. This is the love of benevolence, and this love we are to bear toward our enemies. It is impossible to love the conduct of a person who curses and reviles us, who injures our person or property, or who violates all the laws of God; but, though we may hate his conduct, and suffer keenly when we are affected by it, yet we may still wish well to the person; we may pity his madness and folly; we may speak kindly of him and to him; we may return good for evil; we may aid him in the time of trial; we may seek to do him good here and to promote his eternal welfare hereafter, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom012.htm#017">Rom 12:17-20</a>. This seems to be what is meant by loving our enemies; and this is a special law of Christianity, and the highest possible test of piety, and probably the most difficult of all duties to be performed.
 </p><p>Bless them that curse you - The word "bless" here means to "speak well of" or "speak well to:" - not to curse again or to slander, but to speak of those things which we can commend in an enemy; or, if there is nothing that we can commend, to say nothing about him. The word "bless," spoken of God, means to regard with favor or to confer benefits, as when God is said to bless his people. When we speak of our "blessing God," it means to praise Him or give thanks to Him. When we speak of blessing people, it "unites" the two meanings, and signifies to confer favor, to thank, or to speak well of.
 </p><p>Despitefully use you - The word thus translated means, first, to injure by prosecution in law; then, wantonly and unjustly to accuse, and to injure in any way. This seems to be its meaning here.
 </p><p>Persecute - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#010">Mat 5:10</a>.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">mat 5:45</a></font></span></p>
 <p>That ye may be the children of your Father - In Greek, the sons of your Father. The word "son" has a variety of significations. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#001">Mat 1:1</a>. Christians are called the "sons" or "children" of God in several of these senses: as his offspring; as adopted; as his disciples; as imitators of Him. In this passage the word is applied to them because, in doing good to enemies, they resemble God. He makes His sun to rise upon the evil and good, and sends rain, without distinction, on the just and unjust. So His people should show that they imitate or resemble Him, or that they possess His spirit, by doing good in a similar way. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#046">Matthew 5:46</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_046">mat 5:46</a></font></span></p>
 <p>What reward have ye? - The word "reward" seems to be used in the sense of "deserving of praise." If you only love those that love you, you are selfish; it is not genuine love for the "character," but love for the "benefit," and you deserve no commendation. The very "publicans" would do the same.
 </p><p>The publicans - The publicans were tax-gatherers. Judea was a province of the Roman empire. The Jews bore this foreign yoke with great impatience, and paid their taxes with great reluctance. It happened, therefore, that those who were appointed to collect taxes were objects of great detestation. They were, besides, people who would be supposed to execute their office at all hazards; men who were willing to engage in an odious and hated employment; people often of abandoned character, oppressive in their exactions, and dissolute in their lives. By the Jews they were associated in character with thieves and adulterers; with the profane and the dissolute. Christ says that even these wretched people would love their benefactors. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#047">Matthew 5:47</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_047">mat 5:47</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And if you salute your brethren ... - The word "salute" here means to show the customary tokens of civility, or to treat with the common marks of friendship. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk010.htm#004">Luk 10:4</a>. The Saviour says that the worst men, the very publicans, would do this. Christians should do more; they should show that they have a different spirit; they should treat their "enemies" as well as wicked people do their "friends." This should be done:
 </p><p>1. Because it is "right;" it is the only really amiable spirit; and,
 </p><p>2. We should show that religion is not selfish, and is superior to all other principles of action. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#048">Matthew 5:48</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_048">mat 5:48</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Be ye therefore perfect ... - The Saviour concludes this part of the discourse by commanding his disciples to be "perfect." This word commonly means "finished, complete, pure, holy." Originally, it is applied to a piece of mechanism, as a machine that is complete in its parts. Applied to people, it refers to completeness of parts, or perfection, where no part is defective or wanting. Thus, Job <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#001">Job 1:1</a> is said to be "perfect;" that is, not holy as God, or "sinless" - for fault is afterward found with him <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job009.htm#020">Job 9:20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job042.htm#006">Job 42:6</a>; but his piety was "proportionate" - had a completeness of parts was consistent and regular. He exhibited his religion as a prince, a father, an individual, a benefactor of the poor. He was not merely a pious man in one place, but uniformly. He was consistent everywhere. See the notes at that passage. This is the meaning in Matthew. Be not religious merely in loving your friends and neighbors, but let your piety be shown in loving your enemies; imitate God; let your piety be "complete, proportionate, regular." This every Christian may be; this every Christian must be.
 </p><p> Remarks On Matthew 5
 </p><p>1. The gospel pronounces blessings on things far different from what the world has thought to be a source of happiness. People suppose that happiness is to be found in mirth, in wealth, in honor, in esteem, in freedom from persecution. Christ says that it is to be sought in the reverse. Often people are most happy in poverty, in sickness, in persecution, when supported by the presence and promises of a merciful God. And if God appoints our station there, we should submit to it, and learn therewith to be content.
 </p><p>2. We may see the evil of anger. It is a species of murder. If secretly cherished, or exhibited by contempt and injury, it must bring down the displeasure of God. It is a source of misery. True enjoyment is found in meekness, peace, calmness, and benevolence. In such a firmness, and steadiness, and dependence on God as to keep the soul unruffled in the midst of provocation, is happiness. Such was Christ.
 </p><p>3. We see the evil of indelicacy of feeling and sentiment, and the strictness and severity of the law respecting the contact of the sexes <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#028">Mat 5:28</a>. And yet what law is more frequently violated? By obscene anecdotes and tales; by songs and gibes; by double meanings and innuendoes; by looks and gestures; by conversation, and obscene books and pictures, this law of our Saviour is perpetually violated. If there is any one sentiment of most value for the comfort, the character, the virtuous sociability of the young - one that will shed the greatest charm over society, and make it the most pure, it is that which inculcates "perfect delicacy" and "purity" in the contact of the sexes. Virtue of any kind never blooms where this is not cherished. Modesty and purity once gone, every flower that would diffuse its fragrance over life withers and dies with it. There is no one sin that so withers and blights every virtue, none that so enfeebles and prostrates every ennobling feeling of the soul, as the violation of the seventh commandment in spirit or in form, in thought or in act. How should purity dwell in the heart, breathe from the lips, kindle in the eye, live in the imagination, and dwell in the conversation of all the young! An eternal, avenging God is near to every wanton thought, marks every eye that kindles with impure desire, rolls the thunder of justice over every polluted soul, and is preparing woe for every violator of the laws of purity and chastity, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro007.htm#022">Pro 7:22-23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro005.htm#005">Pro 5:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pro002.htm#018">Pro 2:18</a>.
 </p><p>4. Revenge is equally forbidden. Persecution, slander, a spirit of litigation, anger, personal abuse, dueling, suicide, murder, are all violations of the law of God, and all must call down His vengeance.
 </p><p>5. We are bound to love our enemies. This is a law of Christianity, original and unique. No system of religion but Christianity has required it, and no act of Christian piety is more difficult. None shows more the power of the grace of God; none is more ornamental to the character; none more like God; and none furnishes better evidence of piety. He that can meet a man kindly who is seeking his hurt; who can speak well of one that is perpetually slandering and cursing him; that can pray for a man that abuses, injures, and wounds him: and that can seek heaven for him that wishes his damnation, is in the way to life. This is religion, beautiful as its native skies; pure like its Source; kind like its Author; fresh like the dews of the morning; clear and diffusive like the beams of the rising sun; and holy like the feelings and words that come from the bosom of the Son of God. He that can do this need not doubt that he is a Christian. He has caught the very spirit of the Saviour, and he must inherit eternal life.
