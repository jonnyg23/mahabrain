 <p>Then was Jesus led up of the Spirit - Led up by the Spirit. Luke says <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#001">Luk 4:1</a> that Jesus was "full of the Holy Spirit;" and it was by his influence, therefore, that he went into the desert to be tempted. It was not done by presumption on the part of Jesus, nor was it for a mere display of his power in resisting temptation; but it was evidently that it might be seen that his holiness was such that he could not be seduced from allegiance to God. When the first Adam was created he was subjected to the temptation of the devil, and he fell and involved the race in ruin: it was not improper that the second Adam - the Redeemer of the race - should be subjected to temptation, in order that it might be seen that there was no power that could alienate him from God; that there was a kind and a degree of holiness which no art or power could estrange from allegiance. Mark <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#012">Mar 1:12</a> says that this occurred "immediately" after his baptism; that is, in his case, as not unfrequently happens, the great temptation followed immediately the remarkable manifestation of the divine approbation and favor. In the clearest manifestations of the divine favor to us we may not be far from most powerful temptations, and then may be the time when it is necessary to be most carefully on our guard.
 </p><p>Into the wilderness - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001">Mat 3:1</a>.
 </p><p>To be tempted - The word "tempt," in the original, means to try, to endeavor, to attempt to do a thing; then, to try the nature of a thing, as metals by fire; then, to test moral qualities by trying them, to see how they will endure; then, to endeavor to draw people away from virtue by suggesting motives to evil. This is the meaning here, and this is now the established sense of the word in the English language.
 </p><p>The devil - This word originally means an adversary, or an accuser; then, any one opposed to us; then, an enemy of any kind. It is given in the Scriptures, by way of eminence, to the leader of evil angels - a being characterized as full of subtlety, envy, art, and hatred of mankind. He is known, also, by the name Satan, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job001.htm#006">Job 1:6-12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#026">Mat 12:26</a>; Beelzebub, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#024">Mat 12:24</a>; the old Serpent, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev012.htm#009">Rev 12:9</a>; and the Prince of the power of the air, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph002.htm#002">Eph 2:2</a>. The name is once given to women <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ti1003.htm#011">Ti1 3:11</a>; "Even so must their wives be grave, not slanderers;" in the original, devils. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002">Matthew 4:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">mat 4:2</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Had fasted - Abstained from food.
 </p><p>Forty days and forty nights - It has been questioned by some whether Christ abstained wholly from food, or only from the food to which he was accustomed. Luke says <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#002">Luk 4:2</a> that he ate nothing. This settles the question. Mark says <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#013">Mar 1:13</a> that angels came and ministered unto him. At first view this would seem to imply that he did eat during that time. But Mark does not mention the time when the angels performed this office of kindness, and we are at liberty to suppose that he means to say that it was done at the close of the 40 days; and the rather as Matthew, after giving an account of the temptation, says the same thing <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#002">Mat 4:2</a>. There are other instances of persons fasting 40 days recorded in the Scriptures. Thus, Moses fasted 40 days, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/exo034.htm#028">Exo 34:28</a>. Elijah also fasted the same length of time, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1019.htm#008">Kg1 19:8</a>. In these cases they were no doubt miraculously supported. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#003">Matthew 4:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">mat 4:3</a></font></span></p>
 <p>The tempter - The devil, or Satan. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#001">Mat 4:1</a>.
 </p><p>If thou be the Son of God - If thou art God's own Son, then thou hast power to work a miracle, and here is a suitable opportunity to try thy power, and show that thou art sent from God.
 </p><p>Command that these stones ... - The stones that were lying around him in the wilderness. No temptation could have been more plausible, or more likely to succeed, than this. He had just been declared to be the Son of God <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#017">Mat 3:17</a>, and here was an opportunity to show that he was really so. The circumstances were such as to make it appear plausible and proper to work this miracle. "Here you are," was the language of Satan, "hungry, cast out, alone, needy, poor, and yet the Son of God! If you have this power, how easy could you satisfy your wants! How foolish is it, then, for the Son of God, having all power, to be starving in this manner, when by a word he could show his power and relieve his wants, and when in the thing itself there could be nothing wrong!" 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#004">Matthew 4:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">mat 4:4</a></font></span></p>
 <p>But he answered and said ... - In reply to this artful temptation Christ answered by a quotation from the Old Testament. The passage is found in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu008.htm#003">Deu 8:3</a>. In that place the discourse is respecting manna. Moses says that the Lord humbled the people, and fed them with manna, an unusual kind of food, that they might learn that man did not live by bread only, but that there were other things to support life, and that everything which God had commanded was proper for this. The term "word," used in this place, means very often, in Hebrew, thing, and clearly in this place has that meaning. Neither Moses nor our Saviour had any reference to spiritual food, or to the doctrines necessary to support the faith of believers; but they simply meant that God could support life by other things than bread; that man was to live, not by that only, but by every other thing which proceeded out of his mouth; that is, which he chose to command people to eat. The substance of his answer, then, is: "It is not so imperiously necessary that I should have bread as to make a miracle proper to procure it. Life depends on the will of God. He can support it in other ways as well as by bread. He has created other things to be eaten, and man may live by everything that his Maker has commanded." And from this temptation we may learn:
 </p><p>1. That Satan often takes advantage of our circumstances and wants to tempt us. The poor, the hungry, and the naked he often tempts to repine and complain, and to be dishonest in order to supply their necessities.
 </p><p>2. Satan's temptations are often the strongest immediately after we have been remarkably favored. Jesus had just been called the Son of God, and Satan took this opportunity to try him. He often attempts to fill us with pride and vain self-conceit when we have been favored with any peace of mind, or any new view of God, and endeavors to urge us to do something which may bring us low and lead us to sin.
 </p><p>3. His temptations are plausible. They often seem to be only urging us to do what is good and proper. They seem even to urge us to promote the glory of God, and to honor him. We are not to think, therefore, that because a thing may seem to be good in itself, that therefore it is to be done. Some of the most powerful temptations of Satan occur when he seems to be urging us to do what shall be for the glory of God.
 </p><p>4. We are to meet the temptations of Satan, as the Saviour did, with the plain and positive declarations of Scripture. We are to inquire whether the thing is commanded, and whether, therefore, it is right to do it, and not trust to our own feelings, or even our wishes, in the matter. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#005">Matthew 4:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">mat 4:5</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Then the devil taketh him up - This does not mean that he bore him through the air; or that he compelled him to go against his will, or that he performed a miracle in any way to place him there. There is no evidence that Satan had power to do any of these things, and the word translated taketh him Up does not imply any such thing. It means to conduct one; to lead one; to attend or accompany one; or to induce one to go. It is used in the following places in the same sense: <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num023.htm#014">Num 23:14</a>; "And he (Balak) brought him (Balaam) into the field of Zophim," etc. That is, he led him, or induced him to go there. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#001">Mat 17:1</a>; "and after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James," etc.; that is, led or conducted them - not by any means implying that he bore them by force. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat020.htm#017">Mat 20:17</a>; "Jesus, going to Jerusalem, took the twelve disciples apart," etc. See also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat026.htm#037">Mat 26:37</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat027.htm#027">Mat 27:27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#040">Mar 5:40</a>. From these passages, and many more, it appears that all that is meant here is, that Satan conducted Jesus, or accompanied him; but not that this was done against the will of Jesus.
 </p><p>The holy city - Jerusalem, called holy because the temple was there, and because it was the place of religious solemnities.
 </p><p>Setteth him on a pinnacle of the temple - It is not perfectly certain to what part of the temple the sacred writer here refers. It has been supposed by some that he means the roof. But Josephus says that the roof was covered by spikes of gold, to prevent its being polluted by birds; and such a place would have been very inconvenient to stand upon. Others suppose that it was the top of the porch or entrance to the temple. But it is more than probable that the porch leading to the temple was not as high as the main building. It is more probable that he refers to that part of the sacred edifice which was called Solomon's Porch. The temple was built on the top of Mount Moriah. The temple itself, together with the courts and porches, occupied a large space of ground. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012">Mat 21:12</a>. To secure a level spot sufficiently large, it was necessary to put up a high wall on the east. The temple was surrounded with porches or piazzas 50 feet broad and 75 feet high. The porch on the south side was, however, 67 feet broad and 150 high. From the top of this to the bottom of the valley below was more than 700 feet, and Josephus says that one could scarcely look down without dizziness. The word "pinnacle" does not quite express the force of the original. It is a word given usually to birds, and denotes wings, or anything in the form of wings, and was given to the roof of this porch because it resembled a bird dropping its wings. It was on this place, doubtless, that Christ was placed. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#006">Matthew 4:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">mat 4:6</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself down - The temptation here was, that he should at once avail himself of the protection of a promise of safety made to him, and thus demonstrate that he was the Messiah. If he was the true Messiah he had a certain assurance of protection, a promise that no harm could befall him; and thus, by so surprising a miracle, and such a clear proof of the divine interposition, he could at once establish his claim to the Messiahship. How much more easy would this be than to engage in a slow work of years to establish that claim; to encounter fatigue, and want, and poverty, and persecution, before that claim would be admitted! And where could be a more suitable place for thus at once demonstrating that he was the Son of God, than on this pinnacle of the temple, in the very midst of Jerusalem, and perhaps in the presence of thousands who would see the wonderful performance? The temptation, therefore, in this case was, that by thus establishing his claim he would avoid all the obloquy, persecution, and suffering which he must otherwise endure if he attempted to prove that he was the Son of God by a life of toil and privation.
 </p><p>It is written - That is, there is a passage of Scripture which promises special protection in such a case, and on which you may rely. The argument was not, perhaps, that this applied exclusively to the Messiah, but that, if applicable in any case, it would be in this; if any one could plead this promise, assuredly he could who claimed to be the Son of God.
 </p><p>He shall give his angels charge concerning thee ... - That is, they shall protect thee.
 </p><p>And in their hands they shall bear thee up - They shall sustain thee, or hold thee up, so that thou shalt not be endangered by the fall.
 </p><p>Lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone - This would be especially appropriate in such a case. The promise, as Satan applied it, was that he should not be injured by the stones lying at the bottom of the wall or in the valley below. The case, therefore, seemed to be one that was especially contemplated by the promise. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#007">Matthew 4:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">mat 4:7</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Jesus said unto him, It is written again - Again the Saviour replied to Satan by a text of Scripture - a passage which expressly forbade an act like this.
 </p><p>Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy God - This is quoted literally from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#016">Deu 6:16</a>. The meaning is, thou shalt not try him; or, thou shalt not, by throwing thyself into voluntary and uncommanded dangers, appeal to God for protection, or trifle with the promises made to those who are thrown into danger by his providence. It is true, indeed, that God aids those of his people who are placed by him in trial or danger; but it is not true that the promise was meant to extend to those who wantonly provoke him and trifle with the promised help. Thus, Satan, artfully using and perverting Scripture, was met and repelled by Scripture rightly applied. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#008">Matthew 4:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">mat 4:8</a></font></span></p>
 <p>An exceeding high mountain - It is not known what mountain this was. It was probably some elevated place in the vicinity of Jerusalem, from the top of which could be seen no small part of the land of Palestine. The Abbe Mariti speaks of a mountain on which he was, which answers to the description here. "This part of the mountain," says he, "overlooks the mountains of Arabia, the country of Gilead, the country of the Amorites, the plains of Moab, the plains of Jericho, the River Jordan, and the whole extent of the Dead Sea." So Moses, before he died, went up into Mount Nebo, and from it God showed him "all the land of Gilead unto Dan, and all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea, and the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, and the city of palm-trees, unto Zoar," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu034.htm#001">Deu 34:1-3</a>. This shows that there were mountains from which no small part of the land of Canaan could be seen; and we need not suppose that there was any miracle when they were shown to the Saviour.
 </p><p>All the kingdoms of the world - It is not probable that anything more is intended here than the kingdoms of Palestine, or of the land of Canaan, and those in the immediate vicinity. Judea was divided into three parts, and those parts were called kingdoms; and the sons of Herod, who presided over them, were called kings. The term "world" is often used in this limited sense to denote a part or a large part of the world, particularly the land of Canaan. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom004.htm#013">Rom 4:13</a>, where it means the land of Judah; also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk002.htm#001">Luk 2:1</a>, and the note on the place.
 </p><p>The glory of them - The riches, splendor, towns, cities, mountains, etc., of this beautiful land, 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#009">Matthew 4:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">mat 4:9</a></font></span></p>
 <p>All these things ... - All these kingdoms. All these dominions Satan claimed a right to bestow on whom he pleased, and with considerable justice. They were excessively wicked; and with no small degree of propriety, therefore, he asserted his claim to give them away. This temptation had much plausibility. Satan regarded Jesus as the king of the Jews. As the Messiah he supposed he had come to take possession of all that country. He was poor, and unarmed, and without followers or armies. Satan proposed to put him in possession of it at once, without any difficulty, if he would acknowledge him as the proper lord and disposer of that country; if he would trust to him rather than to God.
 </p><p>Worship me - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#002">Mat 2:2</a>. The word here seems to mean, to acknowledge Satan as having a right to give these kingdoms to him; to acknowledge his dependence on him rather than God; that is, really to render religious homage. We may be surprised at his boldness. But he had been twice foiled. He supposed it was an object dear to the heart of the Messiah to obtain these kingdoms. He claimed a right over them; and he seemed not to be asking too much, if he gave them to Jesus, that Jesus should be willing to acknowledge the gift and express gratitude for it. So plausible are Satan's temptations, even when they are blasphemous; and so artfully does he present his allurements to the mind. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#010">Matthew 4:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">mat 4:10</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Get thee hence - These temptations, and this one especially, the Saviour met with a decided rebuke. This was a bolder attack than any which had been made before. The other temptations had been founded on an appeal to his necessities, and an offer of the protection of God in great danger; in both cases plausible, and in neither a direct violation of the law of God. Here was a higher attempt, a more decided and deadly thrust at the piety of the Saviour. It was a proposition that the Son of God should worship the devil, instead of honoring and adoring Him who made heaven and earth; that he should bow down before the Prince of wickedness and give him homage.
 </p><p>It is written - In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu006.htm#013">Deu 6:13</a>. Satan asked him to worship him. This was expressly forbidden, and Jesus therefore drove him from his presence. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#011">Matthew 4:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">mat 4:11</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Then the devil leaveth him - He left him for a time, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#013">Luk 4:13</a>. He intended to return again to the temptation, and, if possible, to seduce him yet from God. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh014.htm#030">Joh 14:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053">Luk 22:53</a>. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/heb012.htm#004">Heb 12:4</a>.
 </p><p>The angels came and ministered - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat001.htm#020">Mat 1:20</a>. They came and supplied his wants and comforted him. From this narrative we may learn:
 </p><p>(a) That no one is so holy as to be free from temptation, for even the Son of God was sorely tempted.
 </p><p>(b) That when God permits a temptation or trial to come upon us, he will, if we look to him, give us grace to resist and overcome it, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1010.htm#013">Co1 10:13</a>.
 </p><p>(c) We see the art of the tempter. His temptations are adapted to times and circumstances. They are plausible. What could have been mere plausible than his suggestions to Christ? They were applicable to his circumstances. They had the appearance of much piety. They were backed by passages of Scripture misapplied, but still most artfully presented. Satan never comes boldly and tempts people to sin, telling them that they are committing sin. Such a mode would defeat his design. It would put people on their guard. He commences, therefore, artfully and plausibly, and the real purpose does not appear until he has prepared the mind for it. This is the way with all temptation. No wicked person would at once tempt another to be profane, to be drunk, to be an infidel, or to commit adultery. The principles are first corrupted. The confidence is secured. The affections are won. And then the allurement is little by little presented, until the victim falls. How everyone should be on his guard at the very first appearance of evil, at the first suggestion that may possibly lead to sin!
 </p><p>(d) One of the best ways of meeting temptation is by applying Scripture. So our Saviour did, and they will always best succeed who best wield the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph006.htm#017">Eph 6:17</a>. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#012">Matthew 4:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">mat 4:12</a></font></span></p>
 <p>John was cast into prison - For an account of the imprisonment of John see <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat014.htm#001">Mat 14:1-13</a>.
 </p><p>He departed into Galilee - See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022">Mat 2:22</a>. The reasons why Jesus then went into Galilee were probably:
 </p><p>1. Because the attention of the people had been much excited by John's preaching, and things seemed to be favorable for success in his own ministry.
 </p><p>2. It appeared desirable to have some one to second John in the work of reformation.
 </p><p>3. It was less dangerous for him to commence his labors there than near Jerusalem. Judea was under the dominion of the scribes, and Pharisees, and priests. They would naturally look with envy on any one who set himself up for a public teacher, and who should attract much attention there. It was important, therefore, that the work of Jesus should begin in Galilee, and become somewhat established and known before he went to Jerusalem. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#013">Matthew 4:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">mat 4:13</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Leaving Nazareth - Because his townsmen cast him out, and rejected him. See Luke 4:14-30.
 </p><p>Came and dwelt in Capernaum - This was a city on the northwest corner of the Sea of Tiberias. It is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but is repeatedly referred to in the Gospels. Though it was once a city of renown, and the metropolis of all Galilee, the site it occupied is now uncertain. When Mr. Fisk, an American missionary, traveled in Syria in 1823, he found 20 or 30 uninhabited Arab huts occupying what are supposed to be the ruins of the once-celebrated city of Capernaum.
 </p><p>The exact site of this ancient city has been a question of much interest, and is not supposed to be as yet fully settled; perhaps it is not possible that it should be. Dr. Robinson (Biblical Researches, iii. pp. 283, 284, 288-295) supposes that the site of the ancient city is a place now called Khan Minyeh. Dr. Thomson (The Land and the Book, vol. ii. pp. 542-547) supposes that it was at a place now called Tell Hum. This place is a short distance north of Khan Minyeh, or the site supposed by Dr. Robinson to be Capernaum. It is at the northwest corner of the Sea of Tiberias.
 </p><p>In this place and its neighborhood Jesus spent no small part of the three years of his public ministry. It is hence called his own city, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#001">Mat 9:1</a>. Here he healed the nobleman's son <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh004.htm#047">Joh 4:47</a>; Peter's wife's mother <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#014">Mat 8:14</a>; the centurion's servant <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#005">Mat 8:5-13</a>; and the ruler's daughter <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat009.htm#023">Mat 9:23-25</a>.
 </p><p>Upon the sea coast - The Sea of Tiberias.
 </p><p>In the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim - These were two tribes of the children of Israel which were located in this part of the land of Canaan, and constituted in the time of Christ a part of Galilee. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/gen049.htm#013">Gen 49:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#010">Jos 19:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos019.htm#032">Jos 19:32</a>. The word "borders" here means boundaries. Jesus came and lived in the boundaries or regions of Zabulon and Naphthali.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">mat 4:14</a></font></span></p>
 <p>That it might be fulfilled ... - This place is recorded in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001">Isa 9:1-2</a>. Matthew has given the sense, but not the very words of the prophet. For the meaning of the passage as employed by Isaiah, see the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#001">Isa 9:1-2</a>.
 </p><p>By the way of the sea - Which is near to the sea, or in the vicinity of the sea.
 </p><p>Beyond Jordan - This does not mean to the east of Jordan, as the phrase sometimes denotes, but rather in the vicinity of the Jordan, or perhaps in the vicinity of the sources of the Jordan. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu001.htm#001">Deu 1:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu004.htm#049">Deu 4:49</a>.
 </p><p>Galilee of the Gentiles - Galilee was divided into upper and lower Galilee. Upper Galilee was called Galilee of the Gentiles, because it was occupied chiefly by Gentiles. It was in the neighborhood of Tyre, Sidon, etc. The word "Gentiles" includes in the Scriptures all who are not Jews. It means the same as nations, or, as we should say, the pagan nations.
 </p><p><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#016">Mat 4:16</a>
 </p><p>The people which sat in darkness - This is an expression denoting great ignorance.
 </p><p>As in darkness or night we can see nothing, and know not where to go, so those who are ignorant of God and their duty are said to be in darkness. The instruction which removes this ignorance is called light. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh003.htm#019">Joh 3:19</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">Pe1 2:9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1001.htm#005">Jo1 1:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jo1002.htm#008">Jo1 2:8</a>. As ignorance is often connected with crime and vice, so darkness is sometimes used to denote sin, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/th1005.htm#005">Th1 5:5</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/eph005.htm#011">Eph 5:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk022.htm#053">Luk 22:53</a>.
 </p><p>Saw great light - That is, as the passage is employed by Matthew, the light under the Messiah would spring up among them. In that region he grew up, and in that region he preached a great part of his discourses and performed a great part of his miracles.
 </p><p>The region and shadow of death - This is a forcible and beautiful image, designed also to denote ignorance and sin. It is often used in the Bible, and is very expressive. A "shadow" is caused by an object coming between us and the sun. So the Hebrews imaged death as standing between us and the sun, and casting a long, dark, and baleful shadow abroad on the face of the nations, denoting their great ignorance, sin, and woe.. It denotes a dismal, gloomy, and dreadful shade, where death and sin reign, like the chills, damps, and horrors of the dwelling-place of the dead. See <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job010.htm#021">Job 10:21</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job016.htm#016">Job 16:16</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/job034.htm#022">Job 34:22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa023.htm#004">Psa 23:4</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer002.htm#006">Jer 2:6</a>. See also the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa009.htm#002">Isa 9:2</a>. These expressions denote that the country of Galilee was especially dark. We know that the people were proverbially ignorant and stupid. They were distinguished for a coarse, outlandish manner of speech <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar014.htm#070">Mar 14:70</a>, and are represented as having been also distinguished by a general profligacy of morals and manners. It shows the great compassion of the Saviour, that he went to preach to such poor and despised sinners. Instead of seeking the rich and the learned, he chose to minister to the needy, the ignorant, and the contemned. His office is to enlighten the ignorant; his delight to guide the wandering, and to raise up those that are in the shadow of death. In doing this, Jesus set an example for all his followers. It is their duty to seek out those who are sitting in the shadow of death, and to send the gospel to them. No small part of the world is still lying in wickedness - as wicked and wretched as was the land of Zabulon and Naphthali in the time of Jesus. The Lord Jesus is able to enlighten them also, and every Christian should regard it a privilege, as well as a duty, to imitate his Saviour in this, and to be permitted to send to them the light of life.

 <p>Sea of Galilee - This was also called the Sea of Tiberias and the Lake of Gennesareth, and also the Sea of Chinnereth, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/num034.htm#011">Num 34:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu003.htm#017">Deu 3:17</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jos012.htm#003">Jos 12:3</a>. Its form is an irregular oval, with the large end to the north. It is about 14 miles in length, and from 6 miles to 9 miles in width. It is about 600 feet lower than the Mediterranean, and this great depression accounts for some of its special phenomena. There is no part of Palestine, it is said, which can be compared in beauty with the environs of this lake. Many populous cities once stood on its shores, such as Tiberias, Bethsaida, Capernaum, Chorazin, Hippo, etc. The shores are described by Josephus as a perfect paradise, producing every luxury under heaven at all seasons of the year, and its remarkable beauty is still noticed by the traveler. "Seen from any point of the surrounding heights, it is a fine sheet of water a burnished mirror set in a framework of surrounding hills and rugged mountains, which rise and roll backward and upward to where hoary Hermon hangs the picture on the blue vault of heaven." The lake is fed mainly by the Jordan; but besides this there are several great fountains and streams emptying into it during the rainy seasons, which pour an immense amount of water into it, raising its level several feet above the ordinary mark. See The Land and the Book (Thomson), vol. ii. p. 77. Lieutenant Lynch reports its greatest ascertained depth at 165 feet. The waters of the lake are sweet and pleasant to the taste, and clear. The lake still abounds with fish, and gives employment, as it did in the time of our Saviour, to those who live on its shores. It is, however, stormy, probably due to the high hills by which it is surrounded.
 </p><p>Simon called Peter - The name "Peter" means a rock, and is the same as "Cephas." See the <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat016.htm#018">Mat 16:18</a> note; also <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh001.htm#042">Joh 1:42</a> note; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/co1015.htm#005">Co1 15:5</a> note.

 <p>Straightway - Immediately - as all should do when the Lord Jesus calls them.
 </p><p>Left their nets - Their nets were the means of their living, perhaps all their property. By leaving them immediately, and following him, they gave every evidence of sincerity. They showed, what we should, that they were willing to forsake all for the sake of Jesus, and to follow him wherever he should lead them. They went forth to persecution and death for his sake; but also to the honor of saving souls from death, and establishing a church that shall continue to the end of time. Little did they know what awaited them when they left their unmended nets to rot on the beach, and followed the unknown and unhonored Jesus of Nazareth. So we know not what awaits us when we become his followers; but we should cheerfully go when our Saviour calls, willing to commit all into his hands - come honor or dishonor, sickness or health, riches or poverty, life or death. Be it ours to do our duty at once, and to commit the result to the great Redeemer who has called us. Compare <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat006.htm#033">Mat 6:33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#021">Mat 8:21-22</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/joh021.htm#021">Joh 21:21-22</a>.

 </p><p>Saw two other brothers - They were men engaged in the same employment, as it is probable that there were many such in the neighborhood of the lake.
 </p><p>In a ship - A small vessel. In fact, it was little more, probably, than a sail-boat.
 </p><p>Mending their nets - A very common employment when they were not actually engaged in fishing.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">mat 4:22</a></font></span></p>
 <p>Left their father - This showed how willing they were to follow Jesus. They showed us what we ought to do. If necessary, we should leave father, and mother, and every friend, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk014.htm#026">Luk 14:26</a>. If they will go with us, and be Christians, it is well; if not, yet they should not hinder us. We should be the followers of Jesus. And, while in doing it we should treat our friends kindly and tenderly, yet we ought at all hazards to obey God, and do our duty to him. We may add that many, very many children, since Sunday schools have commenced, have been the means of their parents' conversion. Many children have spoken to their parents, or read the Bible to them, or other books, and prayed for them, and God has blessed them and converted them. Every child in a Sunday school ought to be a Christian; and then should strive and pray that God would convert his parents, and make them Christians too. We see here, too, what humble instruments God makes use of to convert people. He chose fishermen to convert the world. He chooses the foolish to confound the wise. And it shows that religion is true, and is the power of God, when he makes use of such instruments to change the hearts of people and save their souls.

 <p>All Galilee - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat002.htm#022">Mat 2:22</a>.
 </p><p>Synagogues - Places of worship, or places where the people assembled together to worship God. The origin of synagogues is involved in much obscurity. The sacrifices of the Jews were appointed to be held in one place, at Jerusalem. But there was nothing to forbid the other services of religion to be performed at any other place. Accordingly, the praises of God were sung in the schools of the prophets; and those who chose were assembled by the prophets and seers on the Sabbath, and the new moons, for religious worship, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2004.htm#023">Kg2 4:23</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/sa1010.htm#005">Sa1 10:5-11</a>. The people would soon see the necessity of providing convenient places for their services, to shelter them from storms and from the heat, and this was probably the origin of synagogues. At what time they were commenced is unknown. They are mentioned by Josephus a considerable time before the coming of Christ; and in his time they were multiplied, not only in Judea, but wherever there were Jews. There were no less than 480 in Jerusalem alone before it was taken by the Romans.
 </p><p>Synagogues were built in any place where ten men were found who were willing to associate for the purpose, and were the regular customary places of worship. In them the law, i. e. the Old Testament, divided into suitable portions, was read, prayers were offered, and the Scriptures were expounded. The law was so divided that the five books of Moses, and portions of the prophets, could be read through each year. The Scriptures. after being read, were expounded. This was done, either by the officers of the synagogue, or by any person who might be invited by the officiating minister. Our Saviour and the apostles were in the habit of attending at those places continually, and of speaking to the people, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#015">Luk 4:15-27</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act013.htm#014">Act 13:14-15</a>.
 </p><p>The synagogues were built in imitation of the temple, with a center building, supported by pillars, and a court surrounding it. See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#012">Mat 21:12</a>. In the center building, or chapel, was a place prepared for the reading of the law. The law was kept in a chest, or ark, near to the pulpit. The uppermost seats <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat023.htm#006">Mat 23:6</a> were those nearest to the pulpit. The people sat around, facing the pulpit. When the law was read, the officiating person rose; when it was expounded, he was seated. Our Saviour imitated their example, and was commonly seated in addressing the people, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat005.htm#001">Mat 5:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat013.htm#001">Mat 13:1</a>.
 </p><p>Teaching - Instructing the people, or explaining the gospel.
 </p><p>The gospel of the kingdom - The good news respecting the kingdom he was about to set up; or the good news respecting the coming of the Messiah and the nature of his kingdom.
 </p><p>Preaching - See the notes at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat003.htm#001">Mat 3:1</a>.
 </p><p>All manner of sickness - All kinds of sickness. 
 </p><p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat004.htm#024">Matthew 4:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">mat 4:24</a></font></span></p>
 <p>And his fame went throughout all Syria - It is not easy to fix the exact bounds of Syria in the time of our Saviour. It was, perhaps, the general name for the country lying between the Euphrates on the east, and the Mediterranean on the west; and between Mount Taurus on the north, and Arabia on the south. Through all this region his celebrity was spread by his power of working miracles; and, as might be expected, the sick from every quarter were brought to him, in the hope that he would give relief.
 </p><p>Those possessed with devils - Much difficulty exists, and much has been written respecting those in the New Testament said to be possessed with the devil. It has been maintained by many that the sacred writers only meant by this expression to denote those who were melancholy or epileptic, or afflicted with some other grievous disease. This opinion has been supported by arguments too long to be repeated here. On the other hand, it has been supposed that the persons so described were under the influence of evil spirits, who had complete possession of the faculties, and who produced many symptoms of disease not unlike melancholy, madness, and epilepsy. That such was the fact will appear from the following considerations:
 </p><p>1. Christ and the apostles spoke to them and of them as such; they addressed them, and managed them, precisely as if they were so possessed, leaving their hearers to infer beyond a doubt that such was their real opinion.
 </p><p>2. Those who were thus possessed spake, conversed, asked questions, gave answers, and expressed their knowledge of Christ, and their fear of him things that certainly could not be said of diseases, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#028">Mat 8:28</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk008.htm#027">Luk 8:27</a>.
 </p><p>3. The devils, or evil spirits, are represented as going out of the persons possessed, and entering the bodies of others, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#032">Mat 8:32</a>.
 </p><p>4. Jesus spake to them, and asked their name, and they answered him. He threatened them, commanded them to be silent, to depart, and not to return, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#025">Mar 1:25</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar005.htm#008">Mar 5:8</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#025">Mar 9:25</a>.
 </p><p>5. Those possessed are said "to know Christ; to be acquainted with the Son of God," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk004.htm#034">Luk 4:34</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar001.htm#024">Mar 1:24</a>. This could not be said of diseases.
 </p><p>6. The early fathers of the Church interpreted these passages in the same way. They derived their opinions probably from the apostles themselves, and their opinions are a fair interpretation of the apostles' sentiments.
 </p><p>7. If it is denied that Christ believed in such possessions, it does not appear why any other clearly-expressed sentiment of his may not in the same way be disputed. There is, perhaps, no subject on which he expressed himself more clearly, or acted more uniformly, or which he left more clearly impressed on the minds of his disciples.
 </p><p>Nor is there any absurdity in the opinion that those persons were really under the influence of devils. For:
 </p><p>1. It is no more absurd to suppose that an angel, or many angels, should have fallen and become wicked than that so many people should.
 </p><p>2. It is no more absurd that Satan should have possession of the human faculties, or inflict diseases, than that people should do it a thing which is done every day. What is more common than for a wicked man to corrupt the morals of others, or, by inducing them to become intemperate, to produce a state of body and mind quite as bad as to be possessed with the devil?
 </p><p>3. We still see a multitude of cases that no man can prove not to be produced by the presence of an evil spirit. Who would attempt to say that some evil being may not have much to do in the case of madmen?
 </p><p>4. It afforded an opportunity for Christ to show his power over the enemies of himself and of man, and thus to evince himself qualified to meet every enemy of the race, and triumphantly to redeem his people. He came to destroy the power of Satan, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act026.htm#018">Act 26:18</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom016.htm#020">Rom 16:20-21</a>.
 </p><p>Those which were lunatic - This name is given to the disease from the Latin name of the moon (Luna). It has the same origin in Greek. It was given because it was formerly imagined that the patient was affected by the increase or the decrease of the moon. The name is still retained, although it is certain that the moon has no effect on the disease. The disease is mentioned only in this place, and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat017.htm#015">Mat 17:15</a>. It was probably the falling-sickness or epilepsy, the same as the disease mentioned <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mar009.htm#018">Mar 9:18-20</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk009.htm#039">Luk 9:39-40</a>.
 </p><p>And those that had the palsy - Many infirmities were included under the general name of palsy in the New Testament.
 </p><p>1. The paralytic shock, affecting the whole body.
 </p><p>2. The hemiplegy, affecting only one side of the body; the most frequent form of the disease.
 </p><p>3. The paraplegy, affecting all the system below the neck.
 </p><p>4. The catalepsy. This is caused by a contraction of the muscles in the whole or a part of the body, and is very dangerous. The effects are very violent and fatal. For instance, if, when a person is struck, he happens to have his hand extended, he is unable to draw it back; if not extended, he is unable to stretch it out. It gradually becomes diminished in size, and dried up in appearance. Hence, it was called the withered hand, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat012.htm#010">Mat 12:10-13</a>.
 </p><p>5. The cramp. This, in Eastern countries, is a fearful malady, and by no means unfrequent. It originates from chills in the night. The limbs, when seized by it, remain unmovable, and the person afflicted with it resembles one undergoing a torture. This was probably the disease of the servant of the centurion, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#006">Mat 8:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/luk007.htm#002">Luk 7:2</a>. Death follows from this disease in a few days.
 </p><p>And he healed them - This was done evidently by miraculous power. A miracle is an effect produced by divine power above, or opposed to, what are regular effects of the laws of nature. It is not a violation of the laws of nature, but is a suspension of their usual operation, for some important purpose. For instance, the regular effect of death is that the body returns to corruption. The ordinary laws of chemistry had been suspended by the operation of life - a power superior to those laws, and producing new combinations of matter in the animal or vegetable organization. When life is extinct those laws act in their proper power, and the body is decomposed; that is, the materials of which it is composed, under chemical laws, return to their natural forms of gases and earths. When one who claims to be from God suspends that regular effect, and gives life to a dead body for some important purpose, it is a miracle. Such an effect is clearly the result of divine power. No other being but God can do it. When, therefore, Christ and the apostles exercised this power, it was clear evidence that God approved of their doctrines; that he had commissioned them; and that they were authorized to declare his will. He would not give this attestation to a false doctrine. Most or all of these diseases were incurable. When Christ cured them by a word, it was the clearest of all proofs that he was sent from heaven. This is one of the strong arguments for Christianity.

 <p>From Decapolis - Decapolis was the name of a region of country in the bounds of the half-tribe of Manasseh, mainly on the east of Jordan. It was so called because it included 10 cities - the meaning of the word Decapolis in Greek. Geographers generally agree that Scythopolis was the chief of these cities, and was the only one of them west of the Jordan; that Hippo (Hippos), Gadara, Dion (or Dios), Pelea (or Pella), Gerasa (or Gergesa), Philadelphia, and Raphana (or Raphanae), were seven of the remaining nine, and the other two were either Kanatha and Capitolias, or Damascus and Otopos. These cities were inhabited chiefly by foreigners (Greeks) in the days of our Saviour, and not by Jews. Hence, the keeping of swine by the Gergesenes <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat008.htm#030">Mat 8:30-33</a>, which was forbidden by the Jewish law.
