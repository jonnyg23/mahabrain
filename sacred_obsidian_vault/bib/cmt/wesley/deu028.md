 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#001">Deuteronomy Chapter 28</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#002">Deuteronomy 28:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">deu 28:2</a></font></span></p>Overtake thee - Those blessings which others greedily follow after, and never overtake, shall follow after thee, and shall be thrown into thy lap by special kindness. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#003">Deuteronomy 28:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">deu 28:3</a></font></span></p>In the city, and in the field - Whether they were husbandmen or tradesmen, whether in the town or country, they should be preserved from the dangers of both, and have the comforts of both. How constantly must we depend upon God, both for the continuance and comfort of life! We need him at every turn: we cannot be safe, if he withdraw his protection, nor easy, if he suspends his savour: but if he bless us, go where we will, 'tis well with us. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#005">Deuteronomy 28:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">deu 28:5</a></font></span></p>Store - Store - house, it shall always be well replenished and the provision thou hast there shall be preserved for thy use and service. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#006">Deuteronomy 28:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">deu 28:6</a></font></span></p>Comest in - That is, in all thy affairs and administrations. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#009">Deuteronomy 28:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">deu 28:9</a></font></span></p>Establish thee - Shall confirm his covenant with thee, by which he separated thee to himself as an holy and peculiar people. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#010">Deuteronomy 28:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">deu 28:10</a></font></span></p>Of the Lord - That you are in truth his people and children: A most excellent and glorious people, under the peculiar care and countenance of the great God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#011">Deuteronomy 28:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">deu 28:11</a></font></span></p>The same things which were said before are repeated, to shew that God would repeat and multiply his blessings upon them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#012">Deuteronomy 28:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">deu 28:12</a></font></span></p>His treasure - The heaven or the air, which is God's storehouse, where he treasures up rain or wind for man's use. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#013">Deuteronomy 28:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">deu 28:13</a></font></span></p>The head - The chief of all people in power, or at least in dignity and privileges; so that even they that are not under thine authority shall reverence thy greatness and excellency. So it was in David's and Solomon's time, and so it should have been much oftner and much more, if they had performed the conditions. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#015">Deuteronomy 28:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">deu 28:15</a></font></span></p>Overtake thee - So that thou shalt not be able to escape them, as thou shalt vainly hope and endeavour to do. There is no running from God, but by running to him; no flying from his justice, but by flying to his mercy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#020">Deuteronomy 28:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">deu 28:20</a></font></span></p>Vexation - This seems chiefly to concern the mind, arising from the disappointment of hopes and the presages of its approaching miseries. Rebuke - Namely, from God, not so much in words as by his actions, by cross providences, by sharp and sore afflictions. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#023">Deuteronomy 28:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">deu 28:23</a></font></span></p>Brass - Like brass, hard and dry, and shut up from giving rain. Iron - Hard and chapt and barren. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#024">Deuteronomy 28:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">deu 28:24</a></font></span></p>Dust - Either thy rain shall be as unprofitable to thy ground and seed as if it were only so much dust. Or instead of rain shall come nothing but dust from heaven, which being raised and carried up by the wind in great abundance, returns, and falls upon the earth as it were in clouds or showers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#027">Deuteronomy 28:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">deu 28:27</a></font></span></p>The botch of Egypt - Such boils and blains as the Egyptians were plagued with, spreading from head to foot: The emerodes - Or piles. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#028">Deuteronomy 28:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">deu 28:28</a></font></span></p>Blindness - Of mind, so that they shall not know what to do: Astonishment - They shall be filled with wonder and horror because of the strangeness and soreness of their calamities. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#029">Deuteronomy 28:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">deu 28:29</a></font></span></p>Grope at noon day - In the most clear and evident matters thou shalt grossly mistake. Thy ways - Thy counsels and enterprizes shall be frustrated and turn to thy destruction. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#032">Deuteronomy 28:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">deu 28:32</a></font></span></p>Unto another people - By those who have conquered them, and taken them captives, who shall give or sell them to other persons. Fail - Or, be consumed, partly with grief and plentiful tears; and partly with earnest desire, and vain and long expectation of their return. No might - No power to rescue, nor money to ransom them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#033">Deuteronomy 28:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">deu 28:33</a></font></span></p>Which thou knowest not - Which shall come from a far country, which thou didst not at all expect or fear, and therefore will be the more dreadful when they come; a nation whose language thou understandest not, and therefore canst not plead with them for mercy, nor expect any favour from them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#034">Deuteronomy 28:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">deu 28:34</a></font></span></p>Thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes - Quite put out of the possession of their own souls; quite bereaved of all comfort and hope, and abandoned to utter despair. They that walk by sight, and not by faith, are in danger of losing reason itself, when all about them looks frightful; and their condition is bad indeed, who are mad for the sight of their eyes. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#036">Deuteronomy 28:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">deu 28:36</a></font></span></p>Thy king - The calamity shall be both universal, which even thy king shall not be able to avoid, much less the subjects, who have far less advantage and opportunity for escape; and irrecoverable, because he who should protect or rescue them is lost with them, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/lam004.htm#010">Lam 4:10</a>. Wood and stone - So what formerly was their choice and delight now becomes their plague and misery. And this doubtless was the condition of many Israelites under the Assyrian and Balylonish captivities. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#043">Deuteronomy 28:43</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_043">deu 28:43</a></font></span></p>Within thee - Within thy gates; who formerly honoured and served thee, and were some of them glad of the crumbs which fell from thy table. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#045">Deuteronomy 28:45</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">deu 28:45</a></font></span></p>Moreover all these curses - It seems Moses has been hitherto foretelling their captivity in Babylon, by which even after their return, they were brought to the low condition mentioned, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#044">Deu 28:44</a>. But in the following he foretells their last destruction by the Romans. And the present deplorable state of the Jewish nation, so exactly answers this prediction, that it is an incontestable proof of the truth of the prophecy, and consequently of the divine authority of the scriptures. And this destruction more dreadful than the former shews, that their sin in rejecting Christ, was more provoking to God than idolatry itself, and left them more under the power of Satan. For their captivity in Babylon cured them effectually of idolatry in seventy years. But under this last destruction, they continue above sixteen hundred years incurably averse to the Lord Jesus. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#046">Deuteronomy 28:46</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_046">deu 28:46</a></font></span></p>They - These curses now mentioned. A wonder - Signal and wonderful to all that hear of them. 'Tis amazing, a people so incorporated, should be so universally disperst! And that a people scattered in all nations, should not mix with any, but like Cain, be fugitives and vagabonds, and yet so marked as to be known. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#054">Deuteronomy 28:54</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_054">deu 28:54</a></font></span></p>Evil - Unkind, envious, covetous to monopolize these dainty bits to themselves, and grudging that their dearest relations should have any part of them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#056">Deuteronomy 28:56</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_056">deu 28:56</a></font></span></p>Evil - Unmerciful: she will desire or design their destruction for her food. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#057">Deuteronomy 28:57</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_057">deu 28:57</a></font></span></p>Her young one - Heb. after - birth: that which was loathsome to behold, will now be pleasant to eat; and together with it she shall eat the child which was wrapt up in it, and may be included in this expression. Which she shall bear - Or, which she shall have born, that is, her more grown children. She shall eat them - This was fulfilled more than once, to the perpetual reproach of the Jewish nation. Never was the like done either by Greek or Barbarian. See the fruit of being abandoned by God! 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#063">Deuteronomy 28:63</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_063">deu 28:63</a></font></span></p>To destroy you - His just indignation against you will be so great, that it will be a pleasure to him to take vengeance on you. For though he doth not delight in the death of a sinner in itself, yet he doth delight in glorifying his justice upon incorrigible sinners, seeing the exercise of all his attributes must needs please him, else he were not perfectly happy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#065">Deuteronomy 28:65</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_065">deu 28:65</a></font></span></p>Neither shall thy foot have rest - Ye shall have no settlement in the land whither you are banished, but there you shall be tossed about from place to place, and sold from person to person, or Cain - like, wander about. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#066">Deuteronomy 28:66</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_066">deu 28:66</a></font></span></p>Thy life shall hang in doubt - Either because thou art in the hands of thy enemies that have power, and want no will, to destroy thee: or because of the terrors of thy own mind, and the guilt of thy conscience making thee to fear, even where no fear is. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/deu028.htm#068">Deuteronomy 28:68</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_068">deu 28:68</a></font></span></p>Into Egypt - Which was literally fulfilled under Titus, when multitudes of them were carried thither in ships, and sold for slaves. And this expression seems to mind them of that time when they went over the sea without ships, God miraculously drying up the sea before them, which now they would have occasion sadly to remember. By the way - Or, to the way. And the way seems not to be meant here of the usual road - way from Canaan to Egypt, which was wholly by land, but to be put for the end of the way or journey, even the land of Egypt, for to this, and not to the road - way between Canaan and Egypt, agree the words here following, whereof I speak unto thee, thou shalt see it, (that is, Egypt) no more again. No man shall buy you - Either because the number of your captives shall be so great, that the market shall be glutted with you; or because you shall be so loathsome and contemptible that men shall not be willing to have you for slaves. And this was the condition of the Jews after the destruction of Jerusalem, as Josephus the Jew hath left upon record. Let us all learn hence, to stand in awe and not to sin. I have heard of a wicked man (says Mr. Henry) who on reading these threatenings, was so enraged, that he tore the leaf out of his bible. But to what purpose is it, to deface a copy, while the original remains unchangeable? By which it is determined, that the wages of sin is death: yea, a death more dreadful than all that is here spoken!
