 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001">Acts Chapter 19</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#001">Acts 19:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">act 19:1</a></font></span></p>Having passed through - Galatia and Phrygia, which were termed the upper parts of Asia Minor. Certain disciples - Who had been formerly baptized by John the Baptist, and since imperfectly instructed in Christianity. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#002">Acts 19:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">act 19:2</a></font></span></p>Have ye received the Holy Ghost? - The extraordinary gifts of the Spirit, as well as his sanctifying graces? We have not so much as heard - Whether there be any such gifts. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#003">Acts 19:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">act 19:3</a></font></span></p>Into what were ye baptized - Into what dispensation? To the sealing of what doctrine? Into John's baptism - We were baptized by John and believe what he taught. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#004">Acts 19:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">act 19:4</a></font></span></p>John baptized - That is, the whole baptism and preaching of John pointed at Christ. After this John is mentioned no more in the New Testament. Here he gives way to Christ altogether. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#005">Acts 19:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">act 19:5</a></font></span></p>And hearing this, they were baptized - By some other. Paul only laid his hands upon them. They were baptized - They were baptized twice; but not with the same baptism. John did not administer that baptism which Christ afterward commanded, that is, in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#009">Acts 19:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">act 19:9</a></font></span></p>The way - The Christian way of worshipping God. He departed - Leaving them their synagogue to themselves. Discoursing daily - Not on the Sabbath only, in the school of one Tyrannus - Which we do not find was any otherwise consecrated, than by preaching the Gospel there. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#010">Acts 19:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">act 19:10</a></font></span></p>All who desired it among the inhabitants of the proconsular Asia, now heard the word: St. Paul had been forbidden to preach it in Asia before, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/act016.htm#006">Act 16:6</a>. But now the time was come. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#011">Acts 19:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">act 19:11</a></font></span></p>Special miracles - Wrought in a very uncommon manner. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#012">Acts 19:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">act 19:12</a></font></span></p>Evil spirits - Who also occasioned many of those diseases, which yet might appear to be purely natural. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#013">Acts 19:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">act 19:13</a></font></span></p>Exorcists - Several of the Jews about this time pretended to a power of casting out devils, particularly by certain arts or charms, supposed to be derived from Solomon. Undertook to name - Vain undertaking! Satan laughs at all those who attempt to expel him either out of the bodies or the souls of men but by Divine faith. All the light of reason is nothing to the craft or strength of that subtle spirit. His craft cannot be known but by the Spirit of God nor can his strength be conquered but by the power of faith. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#017">Acts 19:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">act 19:17</a></font></span></p>And the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified - So that even the malice of the devil wrought for the furtherance of the Gospel. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#018">Acts 19:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">act 19:18</a></font></span></p>Many came confessing - Of their own accord, and openly declaring their deeds - The efficacy of God's word, penetrating the inmost recesses of their soul, wrought that free and open confession to which perhaps even torments would not have compelled them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#019">Acts 19:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">act 19:19</a></font></span></p>Curious arts - Magical arts, to which that soft appellation was given by those who practised them. Ephesus was peculiarly famous for these. And as these practices were of so much reputation there, it is no wonder the books which taught them should bear a great price. Bringing their books together - As it were by common consent, burnt them - Which was far better than selling them, even though the money had been given to the poor. Fifty thousand pieces of silver - If these pieces of silver be taken for Jewish shekels, the sum will amount to six thousand two hundred and fifty pounds. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#020">Acts 19:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">act 19:20</a></font></span></p>So powerfully did the word of God grow - In extent, and prevail - In power and efficacy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#021">Acts 19:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">act 19:21</a></font></span></p>After these things were ended - Paul sought not to rest, but pressed on, as if he had yet done nothing. He is already possessed of Ephesus and Asia. He purposes for Macedonia and Achaia. He has his eye upon Jerusalem, then upon Rome; afterward on Spain, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom015.htm#028">Rom 15:28</a>. No Cesar, no Alexander the Great, no other hero, comes up to the magnanimity of this little Benjamite. Faith and love to God and man had enlarged his heart, even as the sand of the sea. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#024">Acts 19:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">act 19:24</a></font></span></p>Silver shrines - Silver models of that famous temple, which were bought not only by the citizens, but by strangers from all parts. The artificers - The other silversmiths. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#025">Acts 19:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">act 19:25</a></font></span></p>The workmen - Employed by him and them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#026">Acts 19:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">act 19:26</a></font></span></p>Saying, that they are not gods which are made with hands - This manifestly shows, that the contrary opinion did then generally prevail, namely, that there was a real Divinity in their sacred images. Though some of the later heathens spoke of them just as the Romanists do now. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#027">Acts 19:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">act 19:27</a></font></span></p>There is danger, not only that this our craft [trade] should come into disgrace, but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised - No wonder a discourse should make so deep an impression, which was edged both by interest and superstition. The great goddess was one of the standing titles of Diana. Her majesty destroyed - Miserable majesty, which was capable of being thus destroyed! Whom all Asia and the world - That is, the Roman empire, worshippeth - Although under a great variety of titles and characters. But the multitude of those that err does not turn error into truth. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#029">Acts 19:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">act 19:29</a></font></span></p>They rushed with one accord - Demetrius and his company, into the theatre - Where criminals were wont to be thrown to the wild beasts, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus - When they could not find Paul. Probably they hoped to oblige them to fight with the wild beasts, as some think St. Paul had done before. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#030">Acts 19:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">act 19:30</a></font></span></p>When Paul would have gone in to the people - Being above all fear, to plead the cause of his companions, and prove they are not gods which are made with hands. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#031">Acts 19:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">act 19:31</a></font></span></p>The principal officers of Asia - The Asian priests, who presided over the public games, which they were then celebrating in honour of Diana. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#032">Acts 19:32</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_032">act 19:32</a></font></span></p>The greater part did not know for what they were come together - Which is commonly the case in such an assembly. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#033">Acts 19:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">act 19:33</a></font></span></p>And they thrust forward - Namely, the artificers and workmen, Alexander - Probably some well - known Christian whom they saw in the crowd: the Jews pushing him on - To expose him to the more danger. And Alexander waving with his hand - In token of desiring silence, would have made a defence - For himself and his brethren. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#034">Acts 19:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">act 19:34</a></font></span></p>But when they knew that he was a Jew - And consequently an enemy to their worship of images; they prevented him, by crying, Great is Diana of the Ephesians. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#035">Acts 19:35</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_035">act 19:35</a></font></span></p>The register - Probably the chief governor of the public games. The image which fell down from Jupiter - They believed that very image of Diana, which stood in her temple, fell down from Jupiter in heaven. Perhaps he designed to insinuate, as if falling down from Jupiter, it was not made with hands, and so was not that sort of idols which Paul had said were no gods. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#037">Acts 19:37</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_037">act 19:37</a></font></span></p>Nor blasphemers of your goddess - They simply declared the one God, and the vanity of idols in general. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#038">Acts 19:38</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_038">act 19:38</a></font></span></p>There are proconsuls - One in every province. There was one at Ephesus. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#039">Acts 19:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">act 19:39</a></font></span></p>In a lawful assembly - In such a regular assembly as has authority to judge of religious and political affairs. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/act019.htm#040">Acts 19:40</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_040">act 19:40</a></font></span></p>This concourse - He wisely calls it by an inoffensive name.
