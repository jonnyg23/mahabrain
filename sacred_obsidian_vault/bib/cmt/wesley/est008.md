 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001">Esther Chapter 8</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#001">Esther 8:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">est 8:1</a></font></span></p>The house - With all his goods and estate, which being justly forfeited to the king, he no less justly bestows it upon the queen, to compensate the danger to which Haman had exposed her. Came - Was by the queen's desire admitted into the king's presence, and family, and, as it seems, made one of the seven princes. Had told - How nearly he was related to her: which 'till this time she had wisely concealed. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#002">Esther 8:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">est 8:2</a></font></span></p>Ring - That ring which he had formerly given to Haman he now gives to Mordecai, and with it that power whereof this ring was a sign, making him, as Haman had been, the keeper of his signet. Set - As her steward, to manage that great estate for her as he thought fittest. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#003">Esther 8:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">est 8:3</a></font></span></p>To put - To repeal that cruel decree. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#005">Esther 8:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">est 8:5</a></font></span></p>If &amp;c. - She uses various expressions, that she might confirm the king's favour, by such a full submission to his good pleasure. Haman - She prudently takes off the hatefulness of the action from the king, and lay's it upon Haman, who had for his own ends contrived the whole business, and circumvented the king in it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#008">Esther 8:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">est 8:8</a></font></span></p>Reverse - For this reason he could not recall the former letters, because they were irrevocable by the law of the Medes and Persians. How much more prudent is our constitution, that no law whatever can be established as to be unrepealable? It is God's prerogative, not to repent, and to say what can never be altered. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#009">Esther 8:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">est 8:9</a></font></span></p>Then - Which was above two months after the former decree. All which time God suffered the Jews to lie under the error of this dreadful day, that they might be more throughly humbled for, and purged from those many and great sins under which they lay; that they might be convinced of their great sin and folly in the many offers they had had of returning to their native country, by which means being dispersed in the several parts of this vast dominion, they were like to be a very easy prey to their enemies, whereas their brethren in Judea were in a better capacity to preserve themselves: and for the greater illustration of God's glorious power, and wisdom, and goodness, in giving his people such an admirable and unexpected deliverance. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#010">Esther 8:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">est 8:10</a></font></span></p>Riders - Which were not employed in sending the former letter: but this coming later required more care and speed, that the Jews might be eased from their present fears, and have time to provide for their own defence. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#011">Esther 8:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">est 8:11</a></font></span></p>To stand - To fight for the defence of their lives against all that should seek to destroy them. The power - Either governors or governed, without any exception either of age, dignity, or sex, Both little ones and women - Which is here added, to strike the greater terror into their enemies; and according to the laws and customs of this kingdom; whereby children were punished for their parents offences: yet we read nothing in the execution of this decree of the slaughter of women or children, nor is it probable, they would kill their innocent children, who were so indulgent to their families, as not to meddle with the spoil. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#015">Esther 8:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">est 8:15</a></font></span></p>Great crown - Which the chief of the Persian princes were permitted to wear but with sufficient distinction from the king's crown. The city - Not only Jews, but the greatest number of the citizens, who by the law of nature abhorred bloody counsels, and had a complacency in acts of mercy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/est008.htm#016">Esther 8:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">est 8:16</a></font></span></p>Joy - This explains the former metaphor by two words expressing the same thing, to denote the greatness of the joy. Honour - Instead of that contempt under which they had lain.
