 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001">3 Kings (1 Kings) Chapter 7</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#001">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">kg1 7:1</a></font></span></p>House - The royal palace for himself, and for his successors. Thirteen years - Almost double the time to that in which the temple was built; because neither were the materials so far provided and prepared for this, as they were for the temple: nor did either he or his people use the same diligence in this, as in the other work; to which they were quickened by God's express command. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">kg1 7:2</a></font></span></p>Of the forest of Lebanon - An house so called, because it was built in the forest of Lebanon, for a summer - seat, whither Solomon, having so many chariots and horses, might at any time retire with ease. The length - Of the principal mansion; to which doubtless other buildings were adjoining. Pillars - Upon which the house was built, and between which there were four stately walks. Beams - Which were laid for the floor of the second story. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#003">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">kg1 7:3</a></font></span></p>Fifteen - So in this second story were only three rows of pillars, which was sufficient for the ornament of the second and for the support of the third story. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#004">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">kg1 7:4</a></font></span></p>Against light - One directly opposite to the other, as is usual in well - contrived buildings. In ranks - One exactly under another. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#005">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">kg1 7:5</a></font></span></p>Windows - He speaks, of smaller windows or lights, which were over the several doors. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#006">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">kg1 7:6</a></font></span></p>A porch - Supported by divers pillars, for the more magnificent entrance into the house; upon which also it is thought there were other rooms built, as in the house. The porch - Now mentioned which is said to be before them; before the pillars on which the house of Lebanon stood. Pillars - Or, and pillars; That is, fewer and lesser pillars for the support of the lesser porch. Beam - Which was laid upon these pillars, as the others were <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#002">Kg1 7:2</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#007">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">kg1 7:7</a></font></span></p>A porch - Another porch or distinct room without the house. The other - The whole floor; or, from floor to floor, from the lower floor on the ground, to the upper floor which covered it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">kg1 7:8</a></font></span></p>Another court - That is, between the porch and the house, called therefore the middle court, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2020.htm#004">Kg2 20:4</a>. Like this - Not for form or quantity, but for the materials and workmanship, the rooms being covered with cedar, and furnished with like ornaments. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#009">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">kg1 7:9</a></font></span></p>These - Buildings described here and in the former chapter. The measures - Hewed in such measure and proportion as exact workmen use to hew ordinary stones. Within, &amp;c. - Both on the inside of the buildings which were covered with cedar, and on the outside also. To the coping - From the bottom to the top of the building. And so on - Not only on the outside of the front of the house, which being most visible, men are more careful to adorn; but also of the other side of the house, which looked towards the great court belonging to the king's house. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#011">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">kg1 7:11</a></font></span></p>Above - That is, in the upper part; for this is opposed to the foundation. Stones and cedars - Intermixed the one, and the other. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#012">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">kg1 7:12</a></font></span></p>The court - Namely, of Solomon's dwelling - house mentioned, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#008">Kg1 7:8</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#014">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">kg1 7:14</a></font></span></p>In brass - And Of gold, and stone, and purple, and blue, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2002.htm#014">Ch2 2:14</a>. But only his skill in brass is here mentioned, because he speaks only of the brasen things which he made. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#016">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">kg1 7:16</a></font></span></p>Five cubits - The word chapiter is taken either more largely for the whole, so it is five cubits; Or, more strictly, either for the pommels, as they are called, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#012">Ch2 4:12</a>, or for the cornice or crown, and so it was but three cubits, to which the pomegranates being added make it four cubits, as it is below, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#019">Kg1 7:19</a>, and the other work upon it took up one cubit more, which in all made five cubits. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#017">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">kg1 7:17</a></font></span></p>The chapiters - Which those nets and wreathes encompass, either covering, and as it were receiving and holding the pomegranates, or being mixed with them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#018">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">kg1 7:18</a></font></span></p>Two rows - Either of pomegranates, by comparing this with <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020">Kg1 7:20</a>, or of some other curious work. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#019">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">kg1 7:19</a></font></span></p>Lilly work - Made like the leaves of lillies. In the porch - Or, as in the porch; such work as there was in the porch of the temple, in which these pillars were set, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021">Kg1 7:21</a>, that so the work of the tops of these pillars might agree with that in the top of the porch. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#020">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">kg1 7:20</a></font></span></p>The belly - So he calls the middle part of the chapiter, which jetted farthest out. Two hundred - They are said to be ninety and six on a side of a pillar; in one row and in all an hundred, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/jer052.htm#023">Jer 52:23</a>, four great pomegranates between the several checker - works being added to the first ninety six. And it must needs be granted, that there were as many on the other side of the pillar, or in the other row, which makes them two hundred upon a pillar, as is here said, and four hundred upon both pillars, as they are numbered, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/ch2004.htm#013">Ch2 4:13</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#021">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">kg1 7:21</a></font></span></p>Jachin - Jachin signifies he; That is, God shall establish, his temple, and church, and people: and Boaz signifies, in it, or rather, in him (to answer the he in the former name) is strength. So these pillars being eminently strong and stable, were types of that strength which was in God, and would be put forth by God for the defending and establishing of his temple and people, if they were careful to keep the conditions required by God on their parts. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#023">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:23</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">kg1 7:23</a></font></span></p>A Sea - He melted the brass, and cast it into the form of a great vessel, for its vastness called a sea, which name is given by the Hebrews to all great collections of waters. The use of it was for the priests to wash their hands and feet, or other things as occasion required, with the water which they drew out of it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#024">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">kg1 7:24</a></font></span></p>Knops - Carved or molten figures: for this word signifies figures or pictures of all sorts. Ten, &amp;c. - So there were three hundred in all. Cast - Together with the sea; not carved. Two rows - It seems doubtful whether the second row had ten in each cubit, and so there were three hundred more; or, whether the ten were distributed into five in each row. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#025">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">kg1 7:25</a></font></span></p>Oxen - Of solid brass, which was necessary to bear so great a weight. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#026">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:26</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_026">kg1 7:26</a></font></span></p>Baths - Which amounts to five hundred barrels, each bath containing about eight gallons; the bath being a measure of the same bigness with an ephah. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#027">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:27</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_027">kg1 7:27</a></font></span></p>Bases - Upon which stood the ten lavers mentioned below, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#038">Kg1 7:38</a>, in which they washed the parts of the sacrifices. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#028">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:28</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_028">kg1 7:28</a></font></span></p>Borders - Broad brims, possibly for the more secure holding of the lavers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#029">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:29</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_029">kg1 7:29</a></font></span></p>Base above - So he calls the upper - most part of the base: for though it was above, yet it was a base to the laver, which stood upon it. Additions - Either as bases for the feet of the said lions and oxen: or, only as farther ornaments. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#030">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:30</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_030">kg1 7:30</a></font></span></p>Wheels - Whereby the bases and lavers might be removed from place to place as need required. Under - setters - Heb. shoulders; fitly so called, because they supported the lavers, that they should not fall from their bases, when the bases were removed together with the lavers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#031">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:31</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_031">kg1 7:31</a></font></span></p>The mouth - So he calls that part in the top of the base which was left hollow, that the foot of the laver might be let into it. The chapiter - Within the little base, which he calls the chapiter, because it rose up from, and stood above the great base. Above - Above the chapiter; for the mouth went up, and grew wider like a funnel. A cubit - In height, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#035">Kg1 7:35</a>, whereof half a cubit was above the chapiter or little base, and the other half below it. A cubit and half - In compass. Four square - So the innermost part, called the mouth, was round, but the outward part was square, as when a circle is made within a quadrangle. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#033">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:33</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_033">kg1 7:33</a></font></span></p>Molten - And cast together with the bases. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#034">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:34</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_034">kg1 7:34</a></font></span></p>Of the base - Not only of the same matter, but of the same piece, being cast with it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#036">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:36</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_036">kg1 7:36</a></font></span></p>The proportion - Or, empty place, that is, according to the bigness of the spaces which were left empty for them, implying that they were smaller than those above mentioned. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#039">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:39</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_039">kg1 7:39</a></font></span></p>Right side - In the south side, not within the house, but in the priests court, where they washed either their hands or feet, or the parts of the sacrifices. Left side - On the north side. The south - In the south - east part, where the offerings were prepared. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#045">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:45</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_045">kg1 7:45</a></font></span></p>The pots - To boil those parts of the sacrifices which the priests, &amp;c. were to eat. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#048">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:48</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_048">kg1 7:48</a></font></span></p>Vessels - Such as Moses had made only these were larger, and richer, and more. Table of gold - Under which, are comprehended both all the utensils belonging to it, and the other ten tables which he made together with it. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#049">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:49</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_049">kg1 7:49</a></font></span></p>Candlesticks - Which were ten, according to the number of the tables, whereas Moses made but one: whereby might be signified the progress of the light of sacred truth, which was now grown clearer than it was in Moses's time, and should shine brighter and brighter until the perfect day of gospel light. Pure gold - Of massy and fine gold. The oracle - In the holy place. Flowers - Wrought upon the candlesticks, as it had formerly been. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1007.htm#051">3 Kings (1 Kings) 7:51</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_051">kg1 7:51</a></font></span></p>Silver and gold - So much of it as was left. And vessels - Those which David had dedicated, and with them the altar of Moses, and some other of the old utensils which were now laid aside, far better being put in the room of them.
