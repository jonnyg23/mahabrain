 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001">Job Chapter 40</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#001">Job 40:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">job 40:1</a></font></span></p>Answered - Having made a little pause to try what Job could answer. This is not said to be spoken out of the whirlwind, and therefore some think God said it in a still, small voice, which wrought more upon Job, (as upon Elijah) than the whirlwind did. Tho' Job had not spoken any thing, yet God is said to answer him. For he knows mens thoughts, and can return a fit answer to their silence. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#002">Job 40:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">job 40:2</a></font></span></p>Reproveth - That boldly censureth his ways or works; it is at his peril. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#005">Job 40:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">job 40:5</a></font></span></p>Answer - Speak again; I will contend no more with thee. Twice - Often, the definite number being used indefinitely. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#006">Job 40:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">job 40:6</a></font></span></p>Whirlwind - Which was renewed when God renewed his charge upon Job, whom he intended to humble more throughly. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#008">Job 40:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">job 40:8</a></font></span></p>Wilt thou - Every word is emphatical, wilt (art thou resolved upon it) thou (thou Job, whom I took to be one of a better mind) also (not only vindicate thyself, but also accuse me) disannul (not only question, but even repeal and make void, as if it were unjust) my judgment? My sentence against thee, and my government and administration of human affairs? Wilt thou make me unrighteous that thou mayst seem to be righteous? 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#010">Job 40:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">job 40:10</a></font></span></p>Deck - Seeing thou makest thyself equal, yea, superior to me, take to thyself thy great power, come and sit in my throne, and display thy Divine perfections in the sight of the world.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">job 40:15</a></font></span></p>Behemoth - Very learned men take the leviathan to be the crocodile, and the behemoth to be the river - horse, which may fitly be joined with the crocodile, both being well known to Joband his friends, as being frequent in the adjacent parts, both amphibious, living and preying both in the water and upon the land. And both creatures of great bulk and strength. Made - As I made thee. Grass - The river - horse comes out of the river upon the land to feed upon corn, and hay, or grass, as an ox doth, to whom also he is not unlike in the form of his head and feet, and in the bigness of his body, whence the Italians call him, the sea - ox. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#016">Job 40:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">job 40:16</a></font></span></p>Strength - He hath strength answerable to his bulk, but this strength by God's wise and merciful providence is not an offensive strength, consisting in, or put forth by horns or claws, as it is in ravenous creatures, but only defensive and seated in his loins, as it is in other creatures. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#017">Job 40:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">job 40:17</a></font></span></p>Tail - Which though it be but short, yet when it is erected, is exceeding stiff and strong. Thighs - The sinews of his thighs. His thighs and feet are so sinewy and strong, that one of them is able to break or over - turn a large boat. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#019">Job 40:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">job 40:19</a></font></span></p>The chief - He is one of the chief of God's works, in regard of its great bulk and strength. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#020">Job 40:20</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_020">job 40:20</a></font></span></p>Mountains - Though he lives most in the water, yet he often fetches his food from the land, and from the mountains or hills, which are nigh the river Nile.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">job 40:22</a></font></span></p>Brook - Or, of the Nile, of which this word is often used in scripture. His constant residence is in or near this river, or the willows that grow by it.

 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_023">job 40:23</a></font></span></p>River - A great quantity of water, hyperbolically called a river. Hasteth not - He drinks not with fear and caution; but such is his courage, that he fears no enemy either by water or by land. He drinks as if he designed, to drink up the whole river. He mentions Jordan, as a river well known, in and nigh unto Job's land. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/job040.htm#024">Job 40:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">job 40:24</a></font></span></p>Sight - Can any man take him in his eyes? Openly and by force? Surely not. His strength is too great for man to overcome: and therefore men are forced to use wiles and engines to catch him.
