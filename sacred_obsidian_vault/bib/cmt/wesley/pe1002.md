 <p align="CENTER"><font size="-1" color="GREEN"><i>Explanatory Notes on the Whole Bible</i>, by John Wesley, [1754-65], at sacred-texts.com</font></p><hr> <h3 align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001">1 Peter Chapter 2</a></h3> 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#001">1 Peter 2:1</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_001">pe1 2:1</a></font></span></p>Wherefore laying aside - As inconsistent with that pure love. All dissimulation - Which is the outward expression of guile in the heart. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#002">1 Peter 2:2</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_002">pe1 2:2</a></font></span></p>Desire - Always, as earnestly as new born babes do, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1001.htm#003">Pe1 1:3</a>. The milk of the word - That word of God which nourishes the soul as milk does the body, and which is sincere, pure from all guile, so that none are deceived who cleave to it. That you may grow thereby - In faith, love, holiness, unto the full stature of Christ. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#003">1 Peter 2:3</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_003">pe1 2:3</a></font></span></p>Since ye have tasted - Sweetly and experimentally known. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#004">1 Peter 2:4</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_004">pe1 2:4</a></font></span></p>To whom coming - By faith. As unto a living stone - Living from eternity; alive from the dead. There is a wonderful beauty and energy in these expressions, which describe Christ as a spiritual foundation, solid, firm, durable; and believers as a building erected upon it, in preference to that temple which the Jews accounted their highest glory. And St. Peter speaking of him thus, shows he did not judge himself, but Christ, to be the rock on which the church was built. Rejected indeed by men - Even at this day, not only by Jews, Turks, heathens, infidels; but by all Christians, so called, who live in sin, or who hope to be saved by their own works. But chosen of God - From all eternity, to be the foundation of his church. And precious - In himself, in the sight of God, and in the eyes of all believers. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#005">1 Peter 2:5</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_005">pe1 2:5</a></font></span></p>Ye - Believers. As living stones - Alive to God through him. Are built up - In union with each other. A spiritual house - Being spiritual yourselves, and an habitation of God through the Spirit. An holy priesthood - Consecrated to God, and "holy as he is holy." To offer up - Your souls and bodies, with all your thoughts, words, and actions, as spiritual sacrifices to God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#006">1 Peter 2:6</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_006">pe1 2:6</a></font></span></p>He that believeth shall not be confounded - In time or in eternity. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa028.htm#016">Isa 28:16</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#007">1 Peter 2:7</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_007">pe1 2:7</a></font></span></p>To them who believe, he is become the head of the corner - The chief corner stone, on which the whole building rests. Unbelievers too will at length find him such to their sorrow, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/mat021.htm#044">Mat 21:44</a>. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/psa118.htm#022">Psa 118:22</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#008">1 Peter 2:8</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_008">pe1 2:8</a></font></span></p>Who stumble, whereunto also they were appointed - They who believe not, stumble, and fall, and perish for ever; God having appointed from all eternity, "he that believeth not shall be damned." 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#009">1 Peter 2:9</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_009">pe1 2:9</a></font></span></p>But ye - Who believe in Christ Are - In a higher sense than ever the Jews were. A chosen or elect race, a royal priesthood - "Kings and priests unto God," <a href="../../../bib/kjv/rev001.htm#006">Rev 1:6</a>. As princes, ye have power with God, and victory over sin, the world, and the devil: as priests, ye are consecrated to God, for offering spiritual sacrifices. Ye Christians are as one holy nation, under Christ your King. A purchased people - Who are his peculiar property. That ye may show forth - By your whole behaviour, to all mankind. The virtues - The excellent glory, the mercy, wisdom, and power of him, Christ, who hath called you out of the darkness of ignorance, error, sin, and misery. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#010">1 Peter 2:10</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_010">pe1 2:10</a></font></span></p>Who in time past were not a people - Much less the people of God; but scattered individuals of many nations. The former part of the verse particularly respects the gentiles; the latter, the Jews. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#011">1 Peter 2:11</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_011">pe1 2:11</a></font></span></p>Here begins the exhortation drawn from the second motive. Sojourners: pilgrims - The first word properly means, those who are in a strange house; the second, those who are in a strange country. You sojourn in the body; you are pilgrims in this world. Abstain from desires of anything in this house, or in this country. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#012">1 Peter 2:12</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_012">pe1 2:12</a></font></span></p>Honest - Not barely unblamable, but virtuous in every respect. But our language sinks under the force, beauty, and copiousness of the original expressions. That they by your good works which they shall behold - See with their own eyes. May glorify God - By owning his grace in you, and following your example. In the day of visitation - The time when he shall give them fresh offers of his mercy. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#013">1 Peter 2:13</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_013">pe1 2:13</a></font></span></p>Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man - To every secular power. Instrumentally these are ordained by men; but originally all their power is from God. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#014">1 Peter 2:14</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_014">pe1 2:14</a></font></span></p>Or to subordinate governors, or magistrates. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#015">1 Peter 2:15</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_015">pe1 2:15</a></font></span></p>The ignorance - Of them who blame you, because they do not know you: a strong motive to pity them. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#016">1 Peter 2:16</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_016">pe1 2:16</a></font></span></p>As free - Yet obeying governors, for God's sake. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#017">1 Peter 2:17</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_017">pe1 2:17</a></font></span></p>Honour all men - As being made in the image of God, bought by his Son, and designed for his kingdom. Honour the king - Pay him all that regard both in affection and action which the laws of God and man require. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#018">1 Peter 2:18</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_018">pe1 2:18</a></font></span></p>Servants - Literally, household servants. With all fear - Of offending them or God. Not only to the good - Tender, kind. And gentle - Mild, easily forgiving. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#019">1 Peter 2:19</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_019">pe1 2:19</a></font></span></p>For conscience toward God - From a pure desire of pleasing him. Grief - Severe treatment. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#021">1 Peter 2:21</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_021">pe1 2:21</a></font></span></p>Hereunto are ye - Christians. Called - To suffer wrongfully. Leaving you an example - When he went to God. That ye might follow his steps - Of innocence and patience. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#022">1 Peter 2:22</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_022">pe1 2:22</a></font></span></p>In all these instances the example of Christ is peculiarly adapted to the state of servants, who easily slide either into sin or guile, reviling their fellowservants, or threatening them, the natural result of anger without power. He committed himself to him that judgeth righteously - The only solid ground of patience in affliction. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#004">Isa 53:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#006">Isa 53:6-7</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa053.htm#009">Isa 53:9</a>. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#024">1 Peter 2:24</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_024">pe1 2:24</a></font></span></p>Who himself bore our sins - That is, the punishment due to them. In his afflicted, torn, dying body on the tree - The cross, whereon chiefly slaves or servants were wont to suffer. That we being dead to sin - Wholly delivered both from the guilt and power of it: indeed, without an atonement first made for the guilt, we could never have been delivered from the power. Might live to righteousness - Which is one only. The sins we had committed, and he bore, were manifold. 
 <p align="center"><a href="../../../bib/kjv/pe1002.htm#025">1 Peter 2:25</a></p> 
 <p><span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="an_025">pe1 2:25</a></font></span></p>The bishop - The kind observer, inspector, or overseer of your souls.
