 <p>Hosea
 </p><p>Introduction
 </p><p>The Person of the Prophet. - Hosea, הושׁע, i.e., help, deliverance, or regarding it as abstractum pro concreto, helper, salvator, Ὠσηέ (lxx.) or Ὡσηέ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/rom009.htm#020">Rom 9:20</a>), Osee (Vulg.), the son of a certain Beēri, prophesied, according to the heading to his book (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001">Hos 1:1</a>), in the reigns of the kings Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah of Judah, and in that of king Jeroboam, son of Joash, of Israel; and, as the nature of his prophecies clearly proves, he prophesied not only concerning, but in, the kingdom of the ten tribes, so that we must regard him as a subject of that kingdom. This is favoured not only by the fact that his prophetic addresses are occupied throughout with the kingdom of the ten tribes, but also by the peculiar style and language of his prophecies, which have here and there an Aramaean colouring (for example, such forms as אמאסאך, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#006">Hos 6:6</a>; חכּי (inf.), <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009">Hos 11:9</a>; קימושׁ for קמּושׁ, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#006">Hos 9:6</a>; קאם for קם, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014">Hos 10:14</a>; תּרגּלתּי, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#003">Hos 11:3</a>; אוכיל for אאכיל, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#004">Hos 11:4</a>; תּלוּא, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007">Hos 11:7</a>, יפריא for יפרה <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#015">Hos 13:15</a>; and such words as רתת, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#001">Hos 13:1</a>; אהי for איּה <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#010">Hos 13:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014">Hos 13:14</a>), and still more by the intimate acquaintance with the circumstances and localities of the northern kingdom apparent in such passages as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#001">Hos 5:1</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008">Hos 6:8-9</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#012">Hos 12:12</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#006">Hos 14:6</a>., which even goes so far that he calls the Israelitish kingdom "the land" in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002">Hos 1:2</a>, and afterwards speaks of the king of Israel as "our king" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#005">Hos 7:5</a>). On the other hand, neither the fact that he mentions the kings of Judah in the heading, to indicate the period of his prophetic labours (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001">Hos 1:1</a>), nor the repeated allusions to Judah in passing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007">Hos 1:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002">Hos 2:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015">Hos 4:15</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005">Hos 5:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010">Hos 5:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#012">Hos 5:12-14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004">Hos 6:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011">Hos 6:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#014">Hos 8:14</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#011">Hos 10:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001">Hos 12:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#003">Hos 12:3</a>), furnish any proof that he was a Judaean by birth, as Jahn and Maurer suppose. The allusion to the kings of Judah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001">Hos 1:1</a>), and that before king Jeroboam of Israel, may be accounted for not from any outward relation to the kingdom of Judah, but from the inward attitude which Hosea assumed towards that kingdom in common with all true prophets. As the separation of the ten tribes from the house of David was in its deepest ground apostasy from Jehovah (see the commentary on 1 Kings 12.), the prophets only recognised the legitimate rulers of the kingdom of Judah as true kings of the people of God, whose throne had the promise of permanent endurance, even though they continued to render civil obedience to the kings of the kingdom of Israel, until God Himself once more broke up the government, which he had given to the ten tribes in His anger to chastise the seed of David which had fallen away from Him (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#011">Hos 13:11</a>). It is from this point of view that Hosea, in the heading to his book, fixes the date of his ministry according to the reigns of the kings of Judah, of whom he gives a complete list, and whom he also places first; whereas he only mentions the name of one king of Israel, viz., the king in whose reign he commenced his prophetic course, and that not merely for the purpose of indicating the commencement of his career with greater precision, as Calvin and Hengstenberg suppose, but still more because of the importance attaching to Jeroboam II in relation to the kingdom of the ten tribes.
 </p><p>Before we can arrive at a correct interpretation of the prophecies of Hosea, it is necessary, as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#001">Hos 1:1-11</a> and 2 clearly show, that we should determine with precision the time when he appeared, inasmuch as he not only predicted the overthrow of the house of Jehu, but the destruction of the kingdom of Israel as well. The reference to Uzziah is not sufficient for this; for during the fifty-two years' reign of this king of Judah, the state of things in the kingdom of the ten tribes was immensely altered. When Uzziah ascended the throne, the Lord had looked in mercy upon the misery of the ten tribes of Israel, and had sent them such help through Jeroboam, that, after gaining certain victories over the Syrians, he was able completely to break down their supremacy over Israel, and to restore the ancient boundaries of the kingdom (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025">Kg2 14:25-27</a>). But this elevation of Israel to new power did not last long. In the thirty-seventh year of Uzziah's reign, Zechariah, the son and successor of Jeroboam, was murdered by Shallum after a reign of only six months, and with him the house of Jehu was overthrown. From this time forward, yea, even from the death of Jeroboam in the twenty-seventh year of Uzziah's reign, the kingdom advanced with rapid strides towards utter ruin. Now, if Hosea had simply indicated the time of his own labours by the reigns of the kings of Judah, since his ministry lasted till the time of Hezekiah, we might easily be led to assign its commencement to the closing years of Uzziah's reign, in which the decline of the kingdom of Israel had already begun to show itself and its ruin could be foreseen to be the probable issue. If, therefore, it was to be made apparent that the Lord does reveal future events to His servants even "before they spring forth" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa042.htm#009">Isa 42:9</a>), this could only be done by indicating with great precision the time of Hosea's appearance as a prophet, i.e., by naming king Jeroboam. Jeroboam reigned contemporaneously with Uzziah for twenty-six years, and died in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of the latter, who outlived him about twenty-five years, and did not die till the second year of Pekah (see at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#001">Kg2 15:1</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#032">Kg2 15:32</a>). It is evident from this that Hosea commenced his prophetic labours within the twenty-six years of the contemporaneous reigns of Uzziah and Jeroboam, that is to say, before the twenty-seventh year of the former, and continued to labour till a very short time before the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes, since he prophesied till the time of Hezekiah, in the sixth year of whose reign Samaria was conquered by Shalmanezer, and the kingdom of Israel destroyed. The fact that of all the kings of Israel Jeroboam only is mentioned, may be explained from the fact that the house of Jehu, to which he belonged, had been called to the throne by the prophet Elisha at the command of God, for the purpose of rooting out the worship of Baal from Israel, in return for which Jehu received the promise that his sons should sit upon the throne to the fourth generation (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#030">Kg2 10:30</a>); and Jeroboam, the great-grandson of Jehu, was the last king through whom the Lord sent any help to the ten tribes (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#027">Kg2 14:27</a>). In his reign the kingdom of the ten tribes reached its greatest glory. After his death a long-continued anarchy prevailed, and his son Zechariah was only able to keep possession of the throne for half a year. The kings who followed fell, one after another by conspiracies, so that the uninterrupted and regular succession to the throne ceased with the death of Jeroboam; and of the six rulers who came to the throne after his death, not one was called by God through the intervention of a prophet, and only two were able to keep possession of it for any length of time, viz., Menahem for ten years, and Pekah for twenty.
 </p><p>Again, the circumstance that Hosea refers repeatedly to Judah in his prophecies, by no means warrants the conclusion that he was a citizen of the kingdom of Judah. The opinion expressed by Maurer, that an Israelitish prophet would not have troubled himself about the Judeans, or would have condemned their sins less harshly, is founded upon the unscriptural assumption, that the prophets suffered themselves to be influenced in their prophecies by subjective sympathies and antipathies as mere morum magistri, whereas they simply proclaimed the truth as organs of the Spirit of God, without any regard to man at all. If Hosea had been sent out of Judah into the kingdom of Israel, like the prophet in 1 Kings 13., or the prophet Amos, this would certainly have been mentioned, at all events in the heading, just as in the case of Amos the native land of the prophet is given. But cases of this kind formed very rare exceptions to the general rule, since the prophets in Israel were still more numerous than in the kingdom of Judah. In the reign of Jeroboam the prophet Jonah was living and labouring there (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025">Kg2 14:25</a>); and the death of the prophet Elisha, who had trained a great company of young men for the service of the Lord in the schools of the prophets at Gilgal, Bethel, and Jericho, had only occurred a few years before. The fact that a prophet who was born in the kingdom of the ten tribes, and laboured there, alluded in his prophecies to the kingdom of Judah, may be accounted for very simply, from the importance which this kingdom possessed in relation to Israel as a whole, both on account of the promises it had received, and also in connection with its historical development. Whilst the promises in the possession of the Davidic government of the kingdom of Judah formed a firm ground of hope for godly men in all Israel, that the Lord could not utterly and for ever cast off His people; the announcement of the judgments, which would burst upon Judah also on account of its apostasy, was intended to warn the ungodly against false trust in the gracious promises of God, and to proclaim the severity and earnestness of the judgment of God. This also explains the fact that whilst, on the one hand, Hosea makes the salvation of the ten tribes dependent upon their return to Jehovah their God and David their king (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#007">Hos 1:7</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002">Hos 2:2</a>), and warns Judah against sinning with Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#015">Hos 4:15</a>), on the other hand, he announces to Judah also that it is plunging headlong into the very same ruin as Israel, in consequence of its sins (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#005">Hos 5:5</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#010">Hos 5:10</a>., <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#004">Hos 6:4</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#011">Hos 6:11</a>, etc.); whereas the conclusions drawn by Ewald from these passages - namely, that at first Hosea only looked at Judah from the distance, and that it was not till a later period that he became personally acquainted with it, and not till after he had laboured for a long time in the northern part of the kingdom that he came to Judah and composed his book - are not only at variance with the fact, that as early as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#002">Hos 2:2</a> the prophet proclaims indirectly the expulsion of Judah from its own land into captivity, but are founded upon the false notion, that the prophets regarded their own subjective perceptions and individual judgments as inspirations from God.
 </p><p>According to the heading, Hosea held his prophetic office for about sixty or sixty-five years (viz., 27-30 years under Uzziah, 31 under Jotham and Ahaz, and 1-3 years under Hezekiah). This also agrees with the contents of his book. In <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#004">Hos 1:4</a>, the overthrow of the house of Jehu, which occurred about eleven or twelve years after the death of Jeroboam, in the thirty-ninth year of Uzziah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#010">Kg2 15:10</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#013">Kg2 15:13</a>), is foretold as being near at hand; and in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#014">Hos 10:14</a>, according to the most probable explanation of this passage, the expedition of Shalmanezer into Galilee, which occurred, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#003">Kg2 17:3</a>, at the commencement of the reign of Hoshea, the last of the Israelitish kings, is mentioned as having already taken place, whilst a fresh invasion of the Assyrians is threatened, which cannot be any other than the expedition of Shalmanezer against king Hoshea, who had revolted from him, which ended in the capture of Samaria after a three years' siege, and the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes in the sixth year of Hezekiah. The reproof in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#011">Hos 7:11</a>, "They call to Egypt, they go to Assyria," and that in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001">Hos 12:1</a>, "They do make a covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt," point to the same period; for they clearly refer to the time of Hoshea, who, notwithstanding the covenant that he had made with Asshur, i.e., notwithstanding the oath of fidelity rendered to Shalmanezer, purchased the assistance of the king of Egypt by means of presents, that he might be able to shake off the Assyrian yoke. The history knows nothing of any earlier alliances between Israel and Egypt; and the supposition that, in these reproaches, the prophet has in his mind simply two political parties, viz., an Assyrian and an Egyptian, is hardly reconcilable with the words themselves; nor can it be sustained by an appeal to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/isa007.htm#017">Isa 7:17</a>., or even to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/zac010.htm#009">Zac 10:9-11</a>, at least so far as the times of Menahem are concerned. Nor is it any more possible to infer from <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#008">Hos 6:8</a> and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011">Hos 12:11</a>, that the active ministry of the prophet did not extend beyond the reign of Jotham, on the ground that, according to these passages, Gilead and Galilee, which were conquered and depopulated by Tiglath-pileser, whom Ahaz called to his help (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029">Kg2 15:29</a>), were still in the possession of Israel (Simson). For it is by no means certain that <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#011">Hos 12:11</a> presupposes the possession of Galilee, but the words contained in this verse might have been uttered even after the Assyrians had conquered the land to the east of the Jordan; and in that case, the book, which comprises the sum and substance of all that Hosea prophesied during a long period, must of necessity contain historical allusions to events that were already things of the past at the time when his book was prepared (Hengstenberg). On the other hand, the whole of the attitude assumed by Assyria towards Israel, according to <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013">Hos 5:13</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos010.htm#006">Hos 10:6</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#005">Hos 11:5</a>, points beyond the times of Menahem and Jotham, even to the Assyrian oppression, which first began with Tiglath-pileser in the time of Ahaz. Consequently there is no ground whatever for shortening the period of our prophet's active labours. A prophetic career of sixty years is not without parallel. Even Elisha prophesied for at least fifty years (see at <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#020">Kg2 13:20-21</a>). This simply proves, according to the apt remark of Calvin, "how great and indomitable were the fortitude and constancy with which he was endowed by the Holy Spirit." Nothing certain is known concerning the life of the prophet;
 </p><p>(Note: The traditional accounts are very meagre, and altogether unsupported. According to Pseudepiphanius, De vitis prophet. c. xi., Pseudo-Doroth. De prophetis, c. i., and in a Scholion before Ephr. Syri Explan. in Hos., he sprang from Belemoth, or Belemōn, or Beelmoth, in the tribe of Issachar, and is said to have died and been buried there. On the other hand, according to a tradition current among the inhabitants of Thessalonica, found in הקבלה שׁלשׁלת, he died in Babylon. According to an Arabian legend, it was not far from Tripolis, viz., in the city of Almenia; whilst the Arabs also point out a grave, which is supposed to be his, in the land to the east of the Jordan, on the site of Ramoth Gilead; cf. Simson, der Prophet Hosea, p. 1ff.)
 </p><p>but his inner life lies before us in his writings, and from these we may clearly see that he had to sustain severe inward conflicts. For even if such passages as <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004">Hos 4:4-5</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007">Hos 9:7-8</a>, contain no certain indications of the fact, that he had to contend against the most violent hostilities as well as secret plots, as Ewald supposes, the sight of the sins and abominations of his countrymen, which he had to denounce and punish, and the outburst of the divine judgments upon the kingdom thus incessantly ripening for destruction, which he had to experience, could not fail to fill his soul burning as it was for the deliverance of his people, with the deepest anguish, and to involve him in all kinds of conflicts.
 </p><p>2. Times of the Prophet - When Hosea was called to be a prophet, the kingdom of the ten tribes of Israel had been elevated to a position of great earthly power by Jeroboam II. Even under Joash the Lord had had compassion upon the children of Israel, and had turned to them again for the sake of His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; so that Joash had been able to recover the cities, which Hazael of Syria had conquered in the reign of his father Jehoahaz, from Benhadad the son of Hazael, and to restore them to Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2008.htm#023">Kg2 8:23-25</a>). The Lord sent still further help through Jeroboam the son of Joash. Because He had not yet spoken to root out the name of Israel under heaven, He gave them victory in war, so that they were able to conquer Damascus and Hamath again, so far as they had belonged to Judah under David and Solomon, and to restore the ancient boundaries of Israel, from the province of Hamath to the Dead Sea, according to the word of Jehovah the God of Israel, which He had spoken through His servant the prophet Jonah (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#025">Kg2 14:25-28</a>). But this revival of the might and greatness of Israel was only the last display of divine grace, through which the Lord sought to bring back His people from their evil ways, and lead them to repentance. For the roots of corruption, which the kingdom of Israel had within it from its very commencement, were not exterminated either by Joash or Jeroboam. These kings did not depart from the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who had caused Israel to sin, any more than their predecessors (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#011">Kg2 13:11</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2014.htm#024">Kg2 14:24</a>). Jehu, the founder of this dynasty, had indeed rooted out Baal from Israel; but he had not departed from the golden calves at Bethel and Dan, through the setting up of which Jeroboam the son of Nebat had led Israel into sin (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#028">Kg2 10:28-29</a>). Nor did his successors take any more care to walk in the law of Jehovah, the God of Israel, with all their heart. Neither the severe chastisements which the Lord inflicted upon the people and the kingdom, by delivering Israel up to the power of Hazael king of Syria and his son Benhadad, in the time of Jehu and Jehoahaz, causing it to be smitten in all its borders, and beginning to cut off Israel (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2010.htm#032">Kg2 10:32-33</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2013.htm#003">Kg2 13:3</a>); nor the love and grace which He manifested towards them in the reigns of Joash and Jeroboam, by liberating them from the oppression of the Syrians, and restoring the former greatness of the kingdom, - were sufficient to induce the king or the people to relinquish the worship of the calves. This sin of Jeroboam, however, although it was Jehovah who was worshipped under the symbol of the calf, was a transgression of the fundamental law of the covenant, which the Lord had made with Israel, and therefore was a formal departure from Jehovah the true God. And Jeroboam the son of Nebat was not content with simply introducing images or symbols of Jehovah, but had even banished from his kingdom the Levites, who opposed this innovation, and had taken men out of the great body of the people, who were not sons of Levi, and made them priests, and had gone so far as to change the time of celebrating the feast of tabernacles from the seventh month to the eighth (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#031">Kg1 12:31-32</a>), merely for the purpose of making the religious gulf which separated the two kingdoms as wide as possible, and moulding the religious institutions of his kingdom entirely according to his own caprice. Thus the worship of the people became a political institution, in direct opposition to the idea of the kingdom of God; and the sanctuary of Jehovah was changed into a king's sanctuary (Amos 12:13). But the consequences of this image-worship were even worse than these. Through the representation of the invisible and infinite God under a visible and earthly symbol, the glory of the one true God was brought down within the limits of the finite, and the God of Israel was placed on an equality with the gods of the heathen. This outward levelling was followed, with inevitable necessity, by an inward levelling also. The Jehovah worshipped under the symbol of an ox was no longer essentially different from the Baals of the heathen, by whom Israel was surrounded; but the difference was merely a formal one, consisting simply in a peculiar mode of worship, which had been prescribed in His revelation of Himself, but which could not lay the foundation of any permanently tenable party-wall. For, whilst the heathen were accustomed to extend to the national Deity of Israel the recognition which they accorded to the different Baals, as various modes of revelation of one and the same Deity; the Israelites, in their turn, were also accustomed to grant toleration to the Baals; and this speedily passed into formal worship. "Outwardly, the Jehovah-worship still continued to predominate; but inwardly, the worship of idols rose almost into exclusive supremacy. When once the boundary lines between the two religions were removed, it necessarily followed that that religion acquired the strongest spiritual force, which was most in accordance with the spirit of the nation. And from the very corruptions of human nature this was not the strict Jehovah religion, which being given by God did not bring down God to the low level of man, but sought to raise man up to its own lofty height, placing the holiness of God in the centre, and founding upon this the demand for holiness which it made upon its professors; but the voluptuous, sensual teaching of idolatry, pandering as it did to human corruption, just because it was from this it had originally sprung" (Hengstenberg's Christology). This seems to explain the fact, that whereas, according to the prophecies of Amos and Hosea, the worship of Baal still prevailed in Israel under the kings of the house of Jehu, according to the account given in the books of Kings Jehu had rooted out Baal along with the royal house of Ahab (a Kings 10:28). Jehu had merely broken down the outward supremacy of the Baal worship, and raised up the worship of Jehovah once more, under the symbols of oxen or calves, into the state-religion. But this worship of Jehovah was itself a Baal-worship, since, although it was to Jehovah that the legal sacrifices were offered, and although His name was outwardly confessed, and His feasts were observed (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013">Hos 2:13</a>), yet in heart Jehovah Himself was made into a Baal, so that the people even called Him their Baal (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#016">Hos 2:16</a>), and observed "the days of the Baals" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#013">Hos 2:13</a>).
 </p><p>This inward apostasy from the Lord, notwithstanding which the people still continued to worship Him outwardly and rely upon His covenant, had of necessity a very demoralizing influence upon the national life. With the breach of the fundamental law of the covenant, viz., of the prohibition against making any likeness of Jehovah, or worshipping images made by men, more especially in consequence of the manner in which this prohibition was bound up with the divine authority of the law, all reverence not only for the holiness of the law of God, but for the holy God Himself, was undermined. Unfaithfulness towards God and His word begot faithlessness towards men. With the neglect to love God with all the heart, love to brethren also disappeared. And spiritual adultery had carnal adultery as its inevitable consequence, and that all the more because voluptuousness formed a leading trait in the character of the idolatry of Hither Asia. Hence all the bonds of love, of chastity, and of order were loosened and broken, and Hosea uttered this complaint: "There is no truthfulness, and no love, and no knowledge of God in the land. Cursing, and murder, and stealing, and adultery; they break out, and blood reaches to blood" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#001">Hos 4:1-2</a>). No king of Israel could put an effectual stop to this corruption. By abolishing the worship of the calves, he would have rendered the very existence of the kingdom doubtful. For if once the religious wall of division between the kingdom of Israel and the kingdom of Judah had been removed, the political distinction would have been in danger of following. And this was really what the founder of the kingdom of the ten tribes feared (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg1012.htm#027">Kg1 12:27</a>), inasmuch as the royal family that occupied the throne had received no promise from God of permanent continuance. Founded as it was in rebellion against the royal house of David, which God Himself had chosen, it bore within itself from the very first the spirit of rebellion and revolution, and therefore the germs of internal self-destruction. Under these circumstances, even the long, and in outward respects very prosperous, reign of Jeroboam II. could not possibly heal the deep-seated evils, but only helped to increase the apostasy and immorality; since the people, whilst despising the riches of the goodness and mercy of God, looked upon their existing prosperity as simply a reward for their righteousness before God, and were therefore confirmed in their self-security and sins. And this was a delusion which false prophets loved to foster by predictions of continued prosperity (cf. <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#007">Hos 9:7</a>). The consequence was, that when Jeroboam died, the judgments of God began to burst upon the incorrigible nation. There followed, first of all, an anarchy of eleven or twelve years; and it was not till after this that his son Zechariah succeeded in ascending the throne. But at the end of no more than six months he was murdered by Shallum, whilst he in his turn was put to death after a reign of one month by Menahem, who reigned ten years at Samaria (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#014">Kg2 15:14</a>, <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#017">Kg2 15:17</a>). In his reign the Assyrian king Phul invaded the land, and was only induced to leave it by the payment of a heavy tribute (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#019">Kg2 15:19-20</a>). Menahem was followed by his son Pekachiah in the fiftieth year of Uzziah's reign; but after a reign of hardly two years he was murdered by his charioteer, Pekah the son of Remaliah, who held the throne for twenty years (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#022">Kg2 15:22-27</a>), but who accelerated the ruin of his kingdom by forming an alliance with the king of Syria to attack the brother kingdom of Judah (Isaiah 7.). For king Ahaz, when hard pressed by Pekah and the Syrians, called to his help the Assyrian king Tiglath-pileser, who not only conquered Damascus and destroyed the Syrian kingdom, but took a portion of the kingdom of Israel, viz., the whole of the land to the east of the Jordan, and carried away its inhabitants into exile (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#029">Kg2 15:29</a>). Hoshea the son of Elah conspired against Pekah, and slew him in the fourth year of the reign of Ahaz; after which, an eight years' anarchy threw the kingdom into confusion, so that it was not till the twelfth year of Ahaz that Hoshea obtained possession of the throne. Very shortly afterwards, however, he came into subjection to the Assyrian king Shalmanezer, and paid him tribute. But after a time, in reliance upon the help of Egypt, he broke his oath of fealty to the king of Assyria; whereupon Shalmanezer returned, conquered the entire land, including the capital, and led Israel captive into Assyria (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2015.htm#030">Kg2 15:30</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/kg2017.htm#001">Kg2 17:1-6</a>).
 </p><p>3. The Book of Hosea. - Called as he was at such a time as this to proclaim to his people the word of the Lord, Hosea necessarily occupied himself chiefly in bearing witness against the apostasy and corruption of Israel, and in preaching the judgment of God. The ungodliness and wickedness had become so great, that the destruction of the kingdom was inevitable; and the degenerate nation was obliged to be given up into the power of the Assyrians, the existing representatives of the heathen power of the world. But as God the Lord has no pleasure in the death of the sinner, but that he should turn and live, He would not exterminate the rebellious tribes of the people of His possession from the earth, or put them away for ever from His face, but would humble them deeply by severe and long-continued chastisement, in order that He might bring them to a consciousness of their great guilt and lead them to repentance, so that He might at length have mercy upon them once more, and save them from everlasting destruction. Consequently, even in the book of Hosea, promises go side by side with threatenings and announcements of punishment, and that not merely as the general hope of better days, kept continually before the corrected nation by the all-pitying love of Jehovah, which forgives even faithlessness, and seeks out that which has gone astray (Sims.), but in the form of a very distinct announcement of the eventual restoration of the nation, when corrected by punishment, and returning in sorrow and repentance to the Lord its God, and to David its king (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#005">Hos 3:5</a>) - an announcement founded upon the inviolable character of the divine covenant of grace, and rising up to the thought that the Lord will also redeem from hell and save from death, yea, will destroy both death and hell (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#014">Hos 13:14</a>). Because Jehovah had married Israel in His covenant of grace, but Israel, like an unfaithful wife, had broken the covenant with its God, and gone a whoring after idols, God, by virtue of the holiness of His love, must punish its unfaithfulness and apostasy. His love, however, would not destroy, but would save that which was lost. This love bursts out in the flame of holy wrath, which burns in all the threatening and reproachful addresses of Hosea. In this wrath, however, it is not the consuming fire of an Elijah that burns so brightly; on the contrary, a gentle sound of divine grace and mercy is ever heard in the midst of the flame, so that the wrath but gives expression to the deepest anguish at the perversity of the nation, which will not suffer itself to be brought to a consciousness of the fact that its salvation rests with Jehovah its God, and with Him alone, either by the severity of the divine chastisements, or by the friendliness with which God has drawn Israel to Himself as with cords of love. This anguish of love at the faithlessness of Israel so completely fills the mind of the prophet, that his rich and lively imagination shines perpetually by means of changes of figure and fresh turns of thought, to open the eyes of the sinful nation to the abyss of destruction by which it is standing, in order if possible to rescue it from ruin. The deepest sympathy gives to his words a character of excitement, so that for the most part he merely hints at the thoughts in the briefest possible manner, instead of carefully elaborating them, passing with rapid changes from one figure and simile to another, and moving forward in short sentences and oracular utterances rather than in a calmly finished address, so that his addresses are frequently obscure, and hardly intelligible.
 </p><p>(Note: Jerome says of him, "commaticus est et quasi per sententias loquens;" and Ewald discovers in his style "a kernel-like fulness of language, and, notwithstanding many strong figures, which indicate not only poetical boldness and originality but also the tolerably upright thought of those times, a very great tenderness and warmth of language." His diction is distinguished by many peculiar words and forms, such as נאפוּפים (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#004">Hos 2:4</a>), אהבוּ הבוּ (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#018">Hos 4:18</a>), גּהה (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#013">Hos 5:13</a>), שׁעריריּה (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001">Hos 6:1-11</a> :l0), הבהבים (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos008.htm#013">Hos 8:13</a>), תּלאוּבת (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos013.htm#005">Hos 13:5</a>); and by peculiar constructions, such as לא על (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos007.htm#016">Hos 7:16</a>), אל־על (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#007">Hos 11:7</a>), מריבי כהן (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos004.htm#004">Hos 4:4</a>), and many others.)
 </p><p>His book does not contain a collection of separate addresses delivered to the people, but, as is generally admitted now, a general summary of the leading thoughts contained in his public addresses. The book is divisible into two parts, viz., ch. 1-3 and 4-14, which give the kernel of his prophetic labours, the one in a more condensed, and the other in a more elaborate form. In the first part, which contains the "beginning of the word of Jehovah by Hosea" (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002">Hos 1:2</a>), the prophet first of all describes, in the symbolical form of a marriage, contracted by the command of God with an adulterous woman, the spiritual adultery of the ten tribes of Israel, i.e., their falling away from Jehovah into idolatry, together with its consequences, - namely, the rejection of the rebellious tribes by the Lord, and their eventual return to God, and restoration to favour (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos001.htm#002">Hos 1:2</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos002.htm#003">Hos 2:3</a>). He then announces, in simple prophetic words, not only the chastisements and punishments that will come from God, and bring the people to a knowledge of the ruinous consequences of their departure from God, but also the manifestations of mercy by which the Lord will secure the true conversion of those who are humbled by suffering, and their eventual blessedness through the conclusion of a covenant founded in righteousness and grace (Hosea 2:4-23); and this attitude on the part of God towards His people is then confirmed by a symbolical picture in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos003.htm#001">Hos 3:1-5</a>.
 </p><p>In the second part, these truths are expanded in a still more elaborate manner; but the condemnation of the idolatry and moral corruption of Israel, and the announcement of the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes, predominate, - the saving prediction of the eventual restoration and blessedness of those, who come to the consciousness of the depth of their own fall, being but briefly touched upon. This part, again, cannot be divided into separate addresses, as there is an entire absence of all reliable indices, just as in the last part of Isaiah (ch. 40-66); but, like the latter, it falls into three large, unequal sections, in each of which the prophetic address advances from an accusation of the nation generally and in its several ranks, to a description of the coming punishment, and finishes up with the prospect of the ultimate rescue of the punished nation At the same time, an evident progress is discernible in the three, not indeed of the kind supposed by Ewald, namely, that the address contained in ch. 4-9:9 advances from the accusation itself to the contemplation of the punishment proved to be necessary, and then rises through further retrospective glances at the better days of old, at the destination of the church, and at the everlasting love, to brighter prospects and the firmest hopes; nor in that proposed by De Wette, viz., that the wrath becomes more and more threatening from ch. 8 onwards, and the destruction of Israel comes out more and more clearly before the reader's eye. The relation in which the three sections stand to one another is rather the following: In the first, ch. 4-6:3, the religious and moral degradation of Israel is exhibited in all its magnitude, together with the Judgment which follows upon the heels of this corruption; and at the close the conversion and salvation aimed at in this judgment are briefly indicated. In the second and much longer section, Hosea 6:4-11:11, the incorrigibility of the sinful nation, or the obstinate persistence of Israel in idolatry and unrighteousness, in spite of the warnings and chastisements of God, is first exposed and condemned (Hosea 6:4-7:16); then, secondly, the judgment to which they are liable is elaborately announced as both inevitable and terrible (Hosea 8:1-9:9); and thirdly, by pointing out the unfaithfulness which Israel has displayed towards its God from the very earliest times, the prophet shows that it has deserved nothing but destruction from off the face of the earth (9:10-11:8), and that it is only the mercy of God which will restrain the wrath, and render the restoration of Israel possible (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos011.htm#009">Hos 11:9-11</a>). In the third section (ch. 12-14) the ripeness of Israel for judgment is confirmed by proofs drawn from its falling into Canaanitish ways, notwithstanding the long-suffering, love, and fidelity with which God has always shown Himself to be its helper and redeemer (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos012.htm#001">Hos 12:1-14</a>, 13). To this there is appended a solemn appeal to return to the Lord; and the whole concludes with a promise, that the faithful covenant God will display the fulness of His love again to those who return to Him with a sincere confession of their guilt, and will pour upon them the riches of His blessing (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#001">Hos 14:1-9</a>).
 </p><p>This division of the book differs, indeed, from all the attempts that have previously been made; but it has the warrant of its correctness in the three times repeated promise (<a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos006.htm#001">Hos 6:1-3</a>; <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos009.htm#009">Hos 9:9-11</a>, and <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos014.htm#002">Hos 14:2-9</a>), by which each of the supposed sections is rounded off. And within these sections we also meet with pauses, by which they are broken up into smaller groups, resembling strophes, although this further grouping of the prophet's words is not formed into uniform strophes.
 </p><p>(Note: All attempts that have been made to break up the book into different prophecies, belonging to different periods, are wrecked upon the contents of the book itself; single sections being obliged to be made into prophetic addresses, or declared to be such, and the period of their origin being merely determined by arbitrary conjectures and assumptions, or by fanciful interpretations, e.g., as that of the chōdesh, or new moon, in <a href="../../../bib/kjv/hos005.htm#007">Hos 5:7</a>, which is supposed to refer to the reign of Shallum, who only reigned one month.)
 </p><p>For further remarks on this point, see the Exposition.
 </p><p>From what has been said, it clearly follows that Hosea himself wrote out the quintessence of his prophecies, as a witness of the Lord against the degenerate nation, at the close of his prophetic career, and in the book which bears his name. The preservation of this book, on the destruction of the kingdom of the ten tribes, may be explained very simply from the fact that, on account of the intercourse carried on between the prophets of the Lord in the two kingdoms, it found its way to Judah soon after the time of its composition, and was there spread abroad in the circle of the prophets, and so preserved. We find, for example, that Jeremiah has used it again and again in his prophecies (compare Aug. Kueper, Jeremias librorum ss. interpres atque vindex. Berol. 1837 p. 67 seq.).
