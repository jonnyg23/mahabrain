 </i><p align="CENTER">The psalmist restates the great philosophy of Right and Wrong.</p> 
 <p>When I was in distress I called upon the name of the Lord,<br>   I hoped for the help of the God of Jacob and was saved;<br>   For the hope and refuge of the poor art Thou, O God.<br> For who, O God, is strong except to give thanks unto Thee in truth?<br>   And wherein is a man powerful except in giving thanks to Thy name?<br> A new psalm with song in gladness of heart,<br>   The fruit of the lips with the well-tuned instrument of the tongue,<br>   The first fruits of the lips from a pious and righteous heart-- <a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="green">p. 116</font></a><br> He that offereth these things shall never be shaken by evil;<br>   The flame of fire and the wrath against the unrighteous shall not touch him,<br> When it goeth forth from the face of the Lord against sinners,<br>   To destroy all the substance of sinners,<br> For the mark of God is upon the righteous that they may be saved.</p> 
 <p>Famine and sword and pestilence shall be far from the righteous,<br>   For they shall flee away from the pious as men pursued in war;<br> But they shall pursue sinners and overtake them,<br>   And they that do lawlessness shall not escape the judgement of God;<br> As by enemies experienced in war shall they be overtaken,<br>   For the mark of destruction is upon their forehead.<br> And the inheritance of sinners is destruction and darkness,<br>   And their iniquities shall pursue them unto Sheol beneath.<br> Their inheritance shall not be found of their children,<br>   For sins shall lay waste the houses of sinners.<br> And sinners shall perish for ever in the day of the Lord's judgement,<br>   When God visiteth the earth with His judgement.<br> But they that fear the Lord shall find mercy therein,<br>   And shall live by the compassion of their God;<br> But sinners shall perish for ever.</p>
