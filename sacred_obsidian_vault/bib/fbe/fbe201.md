 </i><p align="CENTER">A wonderfully, simple and joyful psalm on the Incarnation.</p> 
 <p>1 As the impulse of anger against evil, so is the impulse of joy over what is lovely, and brings in of its fruits without restraint:<br> 2 My joy is the Lord and my impulse is toward Him: this path of mine is excellent:<br> 3 For I have a helper, the Lord.<br> 4 He hath caused me to know Himself, without grudging, by His simplicity: His kindness has humbled His greatness.<br> 5 He became like me, in order that I might receive Him:<br> 6 He was reckoned like myself in order that I might put Him on;<br> 7 And I trembled not when I saw Him: because He was gracious to me:<br> 8 Like my nature He became that I might learn Him and like my form, that I might not turn back from Him:<br> 9 The Father of knowledge is the word of knowledge:<br> 10 He who created wisdom is wiser than His works:<br> 11 And He who created me when yet I was not knew what I should do when I came into being:<br> 12 Wherefore He pitied me in His abundant grace: and granted me to ask from Him and to receive from His sacrifice:<br> 13 Because He it is that is incorrupt, the fulness of the ages and the Father of them.<br> 14 He hath given Him to be seen of them that are His, in order that they may recognize Him that made them: and that they might not suppose that they came of themselves:<br> 15 For knowledge He hath appointed as its way, He hath widened it and extended it; and brought to all perfection;<br> 16 And set over it the traces of His light, and I walked therein from the beginning even to the end.<br> 17 For by Him it was wrought, and He was resting in the Son, and for its salvation He will take hold of everything;<br> 18 And the Most High shall be known in His Saints, to announce to those that have songs of the coming of the Lord;<br> 19 That they may go forth to meet Him, and may sing to Him with joy and with the harp of many tones:<br> 20 The seers shall come before Him and they shall be seen before Him,<br> 21 And they shall praise the Lord for His love: because He is near and beholdeth.<br> 22 And hatred shall be taken from the earth, and along with jealousy it shall be drowned:<br> 23 For ignorance hath been destroyed, because the knowledge of the Lord hath arrived.<br> 24 They who make songs shall sing the grace of the Lord Most High;<br> 25 And they shall bring their songs, and their heart shall be like the day: and like the excellent beauty of the Lord their pleasant song: <a name="page_124"><font size="1" color="green">p. 124</font></a><br> 26 And there shall neither be anything that breathes without knowledge, nor any that is dumb:<br> 27 For He hath given a mouth to His creation, to open the voice of the mouth towards Him, to praise Him:<br> 28 Confess ye His power, and show forth His grace. Hallelujah.</p>
