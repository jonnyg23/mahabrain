 <h3 align="CENTER">Apocrypha: Sirach Chapter 8</h3><p><a name="001">1</a> Strive not with a mighty man' lest thou fall into his hands. </p>
 <p><a name="002">2</a> Be not at variance with a rich man, lest he overweigh thee: for gold hath destroyed many, and perverted the hearts of kings. </p>
 <p><a name="003">3</a> Strive not with a man that is full of tongue, and heap not wood upon his fire. </p>
 <p><a name="004">4</a> Jest not with a rude man, lest thy ancestors be disgraced. </p>
 <p><a name="005">5</a> Reproach not a man that turneth from sin, but remember that we are all worthy of punishment. </p>
 <p><a name="006">6</a> Dishonour not a man in his old age: for even some of us wax old. </p>
 <p><a name="007">7</a> Rejoice not over thy greatest enemy being dead, but remember that we die all. </p>
 <p><a name="008">8</a> Despise not the discourse of the wise, but acquaint thyself with their proverbs: for of them thou shalt learn instruction, and how to serve great men with ease. </p>
 <p><a name="009">9</a> Miss not the discourse of the elders: for they also learned of their fathers, and of them thou shalt learn understanding, and to give answer as need requireth. </p>
 <p><a name="010">10</a> Kindle not the coals of a sinner, lest thou be burnt with the flame of his fire. </p>
 <p><a name="011">11</a> Rise not up [in anger] at the presence of an injurious person, lest he lie in wait to entrap thee in thy words </p>
 <p><a name="012">12</a> Lend not unto him that is mightier than thyself; for if thou lendest him, count it but lost. </p>
 <p><a name="013">13</a> Be not surety above thy power: for if thou be surety, take care to pay it. </p>
 <p><a name="014">14</a> Go not to law with a judge; for they will judge for him according to his honour. </p>
 <p><a name="015">15</a> Travel not by the way with a bold fellow, lest he become grievous unto thee: for he will do according to his own will, and thou shalt perish with him through his folly. </p>
 <p><a name="016">16</a> Strive not with an angry man, and go not with him into a solitary place: for blood is as nothing in his sight, and where there is no help, he will overthrow thee. </p>
 <p><a name="017">17</a> Consult not with a fool; for he cannot keep counsel. </p>
 <p><a name="018">18</a> Do no secret thing before a stranger; for thou knowest not what he will bring forth. </p>
 <p><a name="019">19</a> Open not thine heart to every man, lest he requite thee with a shrewd turn. </p>
