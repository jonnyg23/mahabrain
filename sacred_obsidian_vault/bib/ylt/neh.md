  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Nehemiah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Words of Nehemiah son of Hachaliah. And it cometh to pass,  in the month of Chisleu, the twentieth year, and I have been in  Shushan the palace,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and come in doth Hanani, one of my brethren, he and men of  Judah, and I ask them concerning the Jews, the escaped part  that have been left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> and they say to me, `Those left, who have been left of the  captivity there in the province, [are] in great evil, and in  reproach, and the wall of Jerusalem is broken down, and its  gates have been burnt with fire.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And it cometh to pass, at my hearing these words, I have sat  down, and I weep and mourn [for] days, and I am fasting and  praying before the God of the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And I say, `I beseech thee, O Jehovah, God of the heavens,  God, the great and the fearful, keeping the covenant and  kindness for those loving Him, and for those keeping His  commands,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> let Thine ear be, I pray Thee, attentive, and Thine eyes  open, to hearken unto the prayer of Thy servant, that I am  praying before Thee to-day, by day and by night, concerning the  sons of Israel Thy servants, and confessing concerning the sins  of the sons of Israel, that we have sinned against Thee; yea, I  and the house of my father have sinned;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> we have acted very corruptly against Thee, and have not kept  the commands, and the statutes, and the judgments, that Thou  didst command Moses Thy servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> `Remember, I pray Thee, the word that Thou didst command  Moses Thy servant, saying, Ye -- ye trespass -- I scatter you  among peoples;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> and ye have turned back unto Me, and kept My commands, and  done them -- if your outcast is in the end of the heavens,  thence I gather them, and have brought them in unto the place  that I have chosen to cause My name to tabernacle there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And they [are] Thy servants, and Thy people, whom Thou hast  ransomed by Thy great power, and by Thy strong hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> `I beseech Thee, O Lord, let, I pray Thee, Thine ear be  attentive unto the prayer of Thy servant, and unto the prayer  of Thy servants, those delighting to fear Thy Name; and give  prosperity, I pray Thee, to Thy servant to-day, and give him  for mercies before this man;' and I have been butler to the  king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And it cometh to pass, in the month of Nisan, the twentieth  year of Artaxerxes the king, wine [is] before him, and I lift  up the wine, and give to the king, and I had not been sad  before him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and the king saith to me, `Wherefore [is] thy face sad, and  thou not sick? this is nothing except sadness of heart;' and I  fear very much,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> and say to the king, `Let the king to the age live!  wherefore should not my face be sad, when the city, the place  of the graves of my fathers, [is] a waste, and its gates have  been consumed with fire?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And the king saith to me, `For what art thou seeking?' and I  pray unto the God of the heavens,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> and say to the king, `If to the king [it be] good, and if  thy servant be pleasing before thee, that thou send me unto  Judah, unto the city of the graves of my fathers, and I built it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And the king saith to me (and the queen is sitting near  him), `How long is thy journey? and when dost thou return?' and  it is good before the king, and he sendeth me away, and I set  to him a time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And I say to the king, `If to the king [it be] good, letters  let be given to me for the governors beyond the River, that  they let me pass over till that I come in unto Judah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and a letter unto Asaph, keeper of the paradise that the  king hath, that he give to me trees for beams [for] the gates  of the palace that the house hath, and for the wall of the city,  and for the house into which I enter;' and the king giveth to  me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And I come in unto the governors beyond the River, and give  to them the letters of the king; and the king sendeth with me  heads of a force, and horsemen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> and Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and Tobiah the servant,  the Ammonite, and it is evil to them -- a great evil -- that a  man hath come in to seek good for the sons of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And I come in unto Jerusalem, and I am there three days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> and I rise by night, I and a few men with me, and have not  declared to a man what my God is giving unto my heart to do for  Jerusalem, and there is no beast with me except the beast on  which I am riding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And I go out through the gate of the valley by night, and  unto the front of the fountain of the dragon, and unto the gate  of the dunghill, and I am measuring about the walls of  Jerusalem, that are broken down, and its gates consumed with  fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And I pass over unto the gate of the fountain, and unto the  pool of the king, and there is no place for the beast under me  to pass over,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> and I am going up through the brook by night, and am  measuring about the wall, and turn back, and come in through  the gate of the valley, and turn back.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And the prefects have not known whither I have gone, and  what I am doing; and to the Jews, and to the priests, and to  the freemen, and to the prefects, and to the rest of those  doing the work, hitherto I have not declared [it];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> and I say unto them, `Ye are seeing the evil that we are  in, in that Jerusalem [is] waste, and its gates have been burnt  with fire; come and we build the wall of Jerusalem, and we are  not any more a reproach.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And I declare to them the hand of my God that is good upon  me, and also the words of the king that he said to me, and they  say, `Let us rise, and we have built;' and they strengthen  their hands for good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And Sanballat the Horonite heareth, and Tobiah the servant,  the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, and they mock at us, and  despise us, and say, `What [is] this thing that ye are doing?  against the king are ye rebelling?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And I return them word, and say to them, `The God of the  heavens -- He doth give prosperity to us, and we His servants  rise and have built; and to you there is no portion, and right,  and memorial in Jerusalem.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Eliashib the high priest riseth, and his brethren the  priests, and they build the sheep-gate; they have sanctified it,  and set up its doors, even unto the tower of Meah they have  sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> and by his hand have men of Jericho built; and by their hand  hath Zaccur son of Imri built;</p>

 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And it cometh to pass, when Sanballat hath heard that we are  building the wall, that it is displeasing to him, and he is  very angry and mocketh at the Jews,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> and saith before his brethren and the force of Samaria, yea,  he saith, `What [are] the weak Jews doing? are they left to  themselves? do they sacrifice? do they complete in a day? do  they revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish? -- and  they burnt!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And Tobiah the Ammonite [is] by him and saith, `Also, that  which they are building -- if a fox doth go up, then it hath  broken down their stone wall.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Hear, O our God, for we have been despised; and turn back  their reproach on their own head, and give them for a spoil in  a land of captivity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> and do not cover over their iniquity, and their sin from  before Thee let not be blotted out, for they have provoked to  anger -- over-against those building.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And we build the wall, and all the wall is joined -- unto  its half, and the people have a heart to work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And it cometh to pass, when Sanballat hath heard, and  Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the  Ashdodites, that lengthening hath gone up to the walls of  Jerusalem, that the breeches have begun to be stopped, then it  is very displeasing to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> and they conspire, all of them together, to come in to fight  against Jerusalem, and to do to it injury.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And we pray unto our God, and appoint a watch against them,  by day and by night, because of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And Judah saith, `The power of the burden-bearers hath  become feeble, and the rubbish [is] abundant, and we are not  able to build on the wall.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And our adversaries say, `They do not know, nor see, till  that we come in to their midst, and have slain them, and caused  the work to cease.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And it cometh to pass, when the Jews have come who are  dwelling near them, that they say to us ten times from all the  places whither ye return -- [they are] against us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And I appoint at the lowest of the places, at the back of  the wall, in the clear places, yea, I appoint the people, by  their families, with their swords, their spears, and their  bows.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And I see, and rise up, and say unto the freemen, and unto  the prefects, and unto the rest of the people, `Be not afraid  of them; the Lord, the great and the fearful, remember ye, and  fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your  wives, and your houses.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And it cometh to pass, when our enemies have heard that it  hath been known to us, and God doth frustrate their counsel,  and we turn back, all of us, unto the wall, each unto his work;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> yea, it cometh to pass, from that day, half of my servants  are working in the business, and half of them are keeping hold  of both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of  mail; and the heads [are] behind all the house of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> The builders on the wall, and the bearers of the burden,  those lading, [each] with one of his hands is working in the  business, and one is laying hold of the missile.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And the builders [are] each with his sword, girded on his  loins, and building, and he who is blowing with a trumpet [is]  beside me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And I say unto the freemen, and unto the prefects, and unto  the rest of the people, `The work is abundant, and large, and  we are separated on the wall, far off one from another;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> in the place that ye hear the voice of the trumpet thither  ye are gathered unto us; our God doth fight for us.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And we are working in the business, and half of them are  keeping hold of the spears, from the going up of the dawn till  the coming forth of the stars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> Also, at that time I said to the people, `Let each with his  servant lodge in the midst of Jerusalem, and they have been to  us by night a guard, and by day [for] the work:'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> and there are none -- I and my brethren and my servants,  the men of the guard who [are] after me -- there are none of us  putting off our garments, each [hath] his vessel of water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And there is a great cry of the people and their wives,  concerning their brethren the Jews,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> yea, there are who are saying, `Our sons, and our daughters,  we -- are many, and we receive corn, and eat, and live.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And there are who are saying, `Our fields, and our  vineyards, and our houses, we are pledging, and we receive corn  for the famine.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And there are who are saying, `We have borrowed money for  the tribute of the king, [on] our fields, and our vineyards;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> and now, as the flesh of our brethren [is] our flesh, as  their sons [are] our sons, and lo, we are subduing our sons and  our daughters for servants, and there are of our daughters  subdued, and our hand hath no might, and our fields and our  vineyards [are] to others.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And it is very displeasing to me when I have heard their cry  and these words,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> and my heart reigneth over me, and I strive with the  freemen, and with the prefects, and say to them, `Usury one  upon another ye are exacting;' and I set against them a great  assembly,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> and say to them, `We have acquired our brethren the Jews,  those sold to the nations, according to the ability that [is]  in us, and ye also sell your brethren, and they have been sold  to us!' and they are silent, and have not found a word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And I say, `Not good [is] the thing that ye are doing; in  the fear of our God do ye not walk, because of the reproach of  the nations our enemies?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And also, I, my brethren, and my servants, are exacting of  them silver and corn; let us leave off, I pray you, this usury.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Give back, I pray you, to them, as to-day, their fields,  their vineyards, their olive-yards, and their houses, and the  hundredth [part] of the money, and of the corn, of the new  wine, and of the oil, that ye are exacting of them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And they say, `We give back, and of them we seek nothing;  so we do as thou art saying.' And I call the priests, and cause  them to swear to do according to this thing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> also, my lap I have shaken, and I say, `Thus doth God shake  out every man, who doth not perform this thing, from his house,  and from his labour; yea, thus is he shaken out and empty;' and  all the assembly say, `Amen,' and praise Jehovah; and the  people do according to this thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Also, from the day that he appointed me to be their  governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even  unto the thirty and second year of Artaxerxes the king --  twelve years -- I, and my brethren, the bread of the governor  have not eaten:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> the former governors who [are] before me have made  themselves heavy on the people, and take of them in bread and  wine, besides in silver forty shekels; also, their servants  have ruled over the people -- and I have not done so, because  of the fear of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> And also, in the work of this wall I have done mightily,  even a field we have not bought, and all my servants are  gathered there for the work;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> and of the Jews, and of the prefects, a hundred and fifty  men, and those coming in unto us of the nations that [are]  round about us, [are] at my table;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> and that which hath been prepared for one day [is] one ox,  six fat sheep, also fowls have been prepared for me, and once  in ten days of all wines abundantly, and with this, the bread  of the governor I have not sought, for heavy is the service on  this people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> Remember for me, O my God, for good, all that I have done  for this people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And it cometh to pass, when it hath been heard by Sanballat,  and Tobiah, and by Geshem the Arabian, and by the rest of our  enemies, that I have builded the wall, and there hath not been  left in it a breach, (also, till that time the doors I had not  set up in the gates,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> that Sanballat sendeth, also Geshem, unto me, saying, `Come  and we meet together in the villages, in the valley of Ono;'  and they are thinking to do to me evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And I send unto them messengers, saying, `A great work I am  doing, and I am not able to come down; why doth the work cease  when I let it alone, and have come down unto you?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> and they send unto me, according to this word, four times,  and I return them [word] according to this word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And Sanballat sendeth unto me, according to this word, a  fifth time, his servant, and an open letter in his hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> it is written in it, `Among the nations it hath been heard,  and Gashmu is saying: Thou and the Jews are thinking to rebel,  therefore thou art building the wall, and thou hast been to  them for a king -- according to these words!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And also, prophets thou hast appointed to call for thee in  Jerusalem, saying, A king [is] in Judah, and now it is heard by  the king according to these words; and now come, and we take  counsel together.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And I send unto him, saying, `It hath not been according to  these words that thou art saying, for from thine own heart thou  art devising them;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> for all of them are making us afraid, saying, `Their hands  are too feeble for the work, and it is not done;' and now,  strengthen Thou my hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And I have entered the house of Shemaiah son of Delaiah,  son of Mehetabeel -- and he is restrained -- and he saith, `Let  us meet at the house of God, at the inside of the temple, and  we shut the doors of the temple, for they are coming in to slay  thee -- yea, by night they are coming in to slay thee.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> and it is very displeasing to me, and I cast all the  vessels of the house of Tobiah without, out of the chamber,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> and I speak, and they cleanse the chambers, and I bring  back thither the vessels of the house of God with the present  and the frankincense.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> And I know that the portions of the Levites have not been  given, and they flee each to his field -- the Levites and the  singers, doing the work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> And I strive with the prefects, and say, `Wherefore hath  the house of God been forsaken?' and I gather them, and set  them on their station;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> and all Judah have brought in the tithe of the corn, and  of the new wine, and of the oil, to the treasuries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And I appoint treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah  the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah of the Levites;  and by their hand [is] Hanan son of Zaccur, son of Mattaniah,  for stedfast they have been reckoned, and on them [it is] to  give a portion to their brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> Be mindful of me, O my God, for this, and do not blot out  my kind acts that I have done, for the house of my God, and for  its charges.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> In those days I have seen in Judah those treading  wine-vats on sabbath, and bringing in the sheaves, and lading  on the asses, and also, wine, grapes, and figs, and every  burden, yea, they are bringing in to Jerusalem on the  sabbath-day, and I testify in the day of their selling  provision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And the Tyrians have dwelt in it, bringing in fish, and  every ware, and selling on sabbath to the sons of Judah and in  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And I strive with the freemen of Judah, and say to them,  `What [is] this evil thing that ye are doing, and polluting the  sabbath-day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> Thus did not your fathers do? and our God bringeth in on  us all this evil, and on this city, and ye are adding  fierceness on Israel, to pollute the sabbath.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And it cometh to pass, when the gates of Jerusalem have  been dark before the sabbath, that I speak, and the doors are  shut, and I say, that they do not open them till after the  sabbath; and of my servants I have stationed at the gates;  there doth not come in a burden on the sabbath-day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> And they lodge -- the merchants and sellers of all ware --  at the outside of Jerusalem, once or twice,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> and I testify against them, and say unto them, `Wherefore  are ye lodging over-against the wall? if ye repeat [it], a hand  I put forth upon you;' from that time they have not come in on  the sabbath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And I say to the Levites, that they be cleansed, and,  coming in, keeping the gates, to sanctify the sabbath-day.  Also, this, remember for me, O my God, and have pity on me,  according to the abundance of Thy kindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> Also, in those days, I have seen the Jews [who] have  settled women of Ashdod, of Ammon, of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> And of their sons, half are speaking Ashdoditish -- and  are not knowing to speak Jewish -- and according to the  language of people and people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> And I strive with them, and declare them vile, and smite  certain of them, and pluck off their hair, and cause them to  swear by God, `Ye do not give your daughters to their sons, nor  do ye take of their daughters to your sons, and to yourselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> `By these did not Solomon king of Israel sin? and among  the many nations there was no king like him, and beloved by his  God he was, and God maketh him king over all Israel -- even him  did the strange women cause to sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> And to you do we hearken to do all this great evil, to  trespass against our God, to settle strange women?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> And [one] of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high  priest, [is] son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite, and I cause  him to flee from off me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> Be mindful of them, O my God, for the redeemed of the  priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the  Levites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> And I have cleansed them from every stranger, and appoint  charges to priests and to Levites, each in his work,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> and for the wood-offering at appointed times, and for  first-fruits. Be mindful of me, O my God, for good. </p>
