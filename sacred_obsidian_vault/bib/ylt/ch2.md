 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And strengthen himself doth Solomon son of David over his  kingdom, and Jehovah his God [is] with him, and maketh him  exceedingly great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And Solomon saith to all Israel, to heads of the thousands,  and of the hundreds, and to judges, and to every honourable one  of all Israel, heads of the fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> and they go -- Solomon, and all the assembly with him -- to  the high place that [is] in Gibeon, for there hath been God's  tent of meeting, that Moses, servant of Jehovah, made in the  wilderness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> but the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjath-Jearim,  when David prepared for it, for he stretched out for it a tent  in Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and the altar of brass that Bezaleel son of Uri, son of Hur  made, he put before the tabernacle of Jehovah; and Solomon and  the assembly seek to it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And Solomon goeth up thither, on the altar of brass, before  Jehovah, that [is] at the tent of meeting, and causeth to  ascend upon it a thousand burnt-offerings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> In that night hath God appeared to Solomon, and saith to  him, `Ask -- what do I give to thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And Solomon saith to God, `Thou hast done with David my  father great kindness, and hast caused me to reign in his  stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Now, O Jehovah God, is Thy word with David my father  stedfast, for Thou hast caused me to reign over a people  numerous as the dust of the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> now, wisdom and knowledge give to me, and I go out before  this people, and I come in, for who doth judge this Thy great  people?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And God saith to Solomon, `Because that this hath been with  thy heart, and thou hast not asked riches, wealth, and honour,  and the life of those hating thee, and also many days hast not  asked, and dost ask for thyself wisdom and knowledge, so that  thou dost judge My people over which I have caused thee to  reign --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> the wisdom and the knowledge is given to thee, and riches  and wealth and honour I give to thee, that there hath not been  so to the kings who [are] before thee, and after thee it is not  so.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And Solomon cometh in [from] the high place that [is] in  Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tent of meeting, and  reigneth over Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and Solomon gathereth chariots and horsemen, and he hath a  thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand  horsemen, and he placeth them in the cities of the chariots,  and with the king in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And the king maketh the silver and the gold in Jerusalem as  stones, and the cedars he made as sycamores that [are] in the  low country, for abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And the source of the horses that [are] to Solomon [is] from  Egypt and from Keva; merchants of the king from Keva take at a  price,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> and they come up, and bring out from Egypt a chariot for  six hundred silverlings, and a horse for fifty and a hundred,  and so for all the kings of the Hittites, and the kings of Aram  -- by their hand they bring out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And Solomon saith to build a house for the name of Jehovah,  and a house for his kingdom,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and Solomon numbereth seventy thousand men bearing burden,  and eighty thousand men hewing in the mountain, and overseers  over them -- three thousand and six hundred.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And Solomon sendeth unto Huram king of Tyre, saying, `When  thou hast dealt with David my father, then thou dost send to  him cedars to build for him a house to dwell in;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> lo, I am building a house to the name of Jehovah my God, to  sanctify [it] to Him, to make perfume before Him, perfume of  spices, and a continual arrangement, and burnt-offerings at  morning and at evening, at sabbaths, and at new moons, and at  appointed seasons of Jehovah our God; to the age this [is] on  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> `And the house that I am building [is] great, for greater  [is] our God than all gods;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and who doth retain strength to build to Him a house, for  the heavens, even the heavens of the heavens, do not contain  Him? and who [am] I that I do build to Him a house, except to  make perfume before Him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> `And now, send to me a wise man to work in gold, and in  silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,  and blue, and knowing to grave gravings with the wise men who  [are] with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my father  prepared;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and send to me cedar-trees, firs, and algums from Lebanon,  for I have known that thy servants know to cut down trees of  Lebanon, and lo, my servants [are] with thy servants,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> even to prepare for me trees in abundance, for the house  that I am building [is] great and wonderful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> `And lo, to hewers, to those cutting the trees, I have  given beaten wheat to thy servants, cors twenty thousand, and  barley, cors twenty thousand, and wine, baths twenty thousand,  and oil, baths twenty thousand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And Huram king of Tyre saith in writing, and sendeth unto  Solomon: `In the love of Jehovah to His people He hath given  thee king over them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Huram saith, `Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, who  made the heavens and the earth, who hath given to David the  king a wise son, knowing wisdom and understanding, who doth  build a house for Jehovah, and a house for his kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> `And now, I have sent a wise man having understanding, of  Huram my father,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> (son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father a  man of Tyre), knowing to work in gold, and in silver, in brass,  in iron, in stones, and in wood, in purple, in blue, and in  fine linen, and in crimson, and to grave any graving, and to  devise any device that is given to him, with thy wise men, and  the wise men of my lord David thy father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> `And, now, the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the  wine, as my lord said, let him send to his servants,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and we -- we cut trees out of Lebanon, according to all thy  need, and bring them in to thee -- floats by sea, to Joppa, and  thou dost take them up to Jerusalem.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And Solomon numbereth all the men, the sojourners who [are]  in the land of Israel, after the numbering with which David his  father numbered them, and they are found a hundred and fifty  thousand, and three thousand, and six hundred;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> and he maketh of them seventy thousand burden-bearers, and  eighty thousand hewers in the mountain, and three thousand and  six hundred overseers, to cause the people to work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Solomon beginneth to build the house of Jehovah, in  Jerusalem, in the mount of Moriah, where He appeared to David  his father, in the place that David had prepared, in the  threshing-floor of Ornan the Jebusite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> and he beginneth to build in the second [day], in the second  month, in the fourth year of his reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And [in] these hath Solomon been instructed to build the  house of God: The length [in] cubits by the former measure [is]  sixty cubits, and the breadth twenty cubits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> As to the porch that [is] on the front, the length [is] by  the front of the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the  height a hundred and twenty, and he overlayeth it within with  pure gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And the large house he hath covered with fir-trees, and he  doth cover it with good gold, and causeth to ascend on it palms  and chains,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> and he overlayeth the house with precious stone for beauty,  and the gold [is] gold of Parvaim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> and he covereth the house, the beams, the thresholds, and  its walls, and its doors, with gold, and hath graved cherubs on  the walls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And he maketh the most holy house: its length [is] by the  front of the breadth of the house twenty cubits, and its  breadth twenty cubits, and he covereth it with good gold, to  six hundred talents;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> and the weight of the nails [is] fifty shekels of gold, and  the upper chambers he hath covered with gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And he maketh in the most holy house two cherubs, image  work, and he overlayeth them with gold;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> as to the wings of the cherubs, their length [is] twenty  cubits, the wing of the one [is] five cubits, touching the wall  of the house, and the other wing [is] five cubits, touching the  wing of the other cherub.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And the wing of the other cherub [is] five cubits touching  the wall of the house, and the other wing [is] five cubits,  adhering to the wing of the other cherub.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> The wings of these cherubs are spreading forth twenty  cubits, and they are standing on their feet and their faces  [are] inward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And he maketh the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson,  and fine linen, and causeth cherubs to go up on it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And he maketh at the front of the house two pillars, thirty  and five cubits in length, and the ornament that [is] on their  heads five cubits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And he maketh chains in the oracle, and putteth on the  heads of the pillars, and maketh a hundred pomegranates, and  putteth on the chains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And he raiseth up the pillars on the front of the temple,  one on the right, and one on the left, and calleth the name of  that on the right Jachin, and the name of that on the left  Boaz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And he maketh an altar of brass, twenty cubits its length,  and twenty cubits its breadth, and ten cubits its height.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And he maketh the molten sea; ten by the cubit, from its  edge unto its edge, round in compass, and five by the cubit its  height, and a line of thirty by the cubit doth compass it,  round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And the likeness of oxen [is] under it, all round about  encompassing it, ten in the cubit, compassing the sea round  about; two rows of oxen are cast in its being cast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> It is standing on twelve oxen, three facing the north, and  three facing the west, and three facing the south, and three  facing the east, and the sea [is] upon them above, and all  their hinder parts [are] within.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And its thickness [is] a handbreadth, and its lip as the  work of the lip of a cup flowered with lilies; taking hold --  baths three thousand it containeth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And he maketh ten lavers, and putteth five on the right, and  five on the left, to wash with them; the work of the  burnt-offering they purge with them; and the sea [is] for  priests to wash with.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And he maketh the ten candlesticks of gold, according to  their ordinance, and placeth in the temple, five on the right,  and five on the left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And he maketh ten tables, and placeth in the temple, five on  the right, and five on the left; and he maketh bowls of gold a  hundred.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And he maketh the court of the priests, and the great court,  and doors for the court, and their doors he hath overlaid with  brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And the sea he hath placed on the right shoulder eastward,  over-against the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And Huram maketh the pots, and the shovels, and the bowls,  and Huram finisheth to make the work that he made for king  Solomon in the house of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> two pillars, and the bowls, and the crowns on the heads of  the two pillars, and the two wreaths to cover the two bowls of  the crowns that [are] on the heads of the pillars;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> and the pomegranates four hundred to the two wreaths, two  rows of pomegranates to the one wreath, to cover the two bowls  of the crowns that [are] on the front of the pillars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And the bases he hath made; and the lavers he hath made on  the bases;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> the one sea, and the twelve oxen under it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> and the pots, and the shovels, and the forks, and all their  vessels, hath Huram his father made for king Solomon, for the  house of Jehovah, of brass purified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> In the circuit of the Jordan hath the king cast them, in  the thick soil of the ground, between Succoth and Zeredathah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And Solomon maketh all these vessels in great abundance,  that the weight of the brass hath not been searched out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And Solomon maketh all the vessels that [are for] the house  of God, and the altar of gold, and the tables, and on them [is]  bread of the presence;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> and the candlesticks, and their lamps, for their burning  according to the ordinance, before the oracle, of gold refined;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> and the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs of gold -- it  [is] the perfection of gold;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and the  censers, of gold refined, and the opening of the house, its  innermost doors to the holy of holies, and the doors of the  house to the temple, of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And all the work that Solomon made for the house of Jehovah  is finished, and Solomon bringeth in the sanctified things of  David his father, and the silver, and the gold, and all the  vessels he hath put among the treasures of the house of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Then doth Solomon assemble the elders of Israel, and all the  heads of the tribes, princes of the fathers of the sons of  Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of  Jehovah from the city of David -- it [is] Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And assembled unto the king are all the men of Israel in the  feast -- it [is] the seventh month;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> and all the elders of Israel come in, and the Levites lift  up the ark,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> and they bring up the ark, and the tent of meeting, and all  the vessels of the sanctuary that [are] in the tent; brought  them up have the priests, the Levites;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> and king Solomon and all the company of Israel who are  convened unto him before the ark are sacrificing sheep and  oxen, that are not counted nor numbered from multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And the priests bring in the ark of the covenant of Jehovah  unto its place, unto the oracle of the house, unto the holy of  holies, unto the place of the wings of the cherubs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> and the cherubs are spreading out wings over the place of  the ark, and the cherubs cover over the ark, and over its  staves, from above;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> and they lengthen the staves, and the heads of the staves  are seen out of the ark on the front of the oracle, and they  are not seen without; and it is there unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> There is nothing in the ark but the two tables that Moses  gave in Horeb, where Jehovah covenanted with the sons of  Israel, in their going out from Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And it cometh to pass, in the going out of the priests from  the sanctuary -- for all the priests who are present have  sanctified themselves, there is none to watch by courses,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> and the Levites, the singers, to all of them, to Asaph, to  Heman, to Jeduthun, and to their sons, and to their brethren,  clothed in white linen, with cymbals, and with psalteries, and  harps, are standing on the east of the altar, and with them  priests, to a hundred and twenty, blowing with trumpets --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> yea, it cometh to pass, as one [are] trumpeters and  singers, to sound -- one voice -- to praise and to give thanks  to Jehovah, and at the lifting up of the sound with trumpets,  and with cymbals, and with instruments of song, and at giving  praise to Jehovah, for good, for to the age [is] His kindness,  that the house is filled with a cloud -- the house of Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> and the priests have not been able to stand to minister  from the presence of the cloud, for the honour of Jehovah hath  filled the house of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Then said Solomon, `Jehovah said -- to dwell in thick  darkness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> and I -- I have built a house of habitation for Thee, and a  fixed place for Thy dwelling to the ages.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And the king turneth round his face, and blesseth the whole  assembly of Israel, and the whole assembly of Israel is  standing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> and he saith, `Blessed [is] Jehovah, God of Israel, who hath  spoken with His mouth with David my father, and with His hands  hath fulfilled [it], saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> `From the day that I brought out My people from the land of  Egypt, I have not fixed on a city out of any of the tribes of  Israel to build a house for my name being there, and I have not  fixed on a man to be leader over My people Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> and I fix on Jerusalem for My name being there, and I fix on  David to be over My people Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> `And it is with the heart of David my father to build a  house for the name of Jehovah God of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> and Jehovah saith unto David my father, Because that it hath  been with thy heart to build a house for My name, thou hast  done well that it hath been with thy heart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> but thou dost not build the house, for thy son who cometh  forth out from thy loins, he doth build the house for My name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> `And Jehovah doth establish His word that He spake, and I  rise up in the stead of David my father, and sit on the throne  of Israel, as Jehovah spake, and I build the house for the name  of Jehovah, God of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> and I place there the ark, where [is] the covenant of  Jehovah that He made with the sons of Israel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And he standeth before the altar of Jehovah, over-against  all the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth out his hand, --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> for Solomon hath made a scaffold of brass, and putteth it  in the midst of the court, five cubits its length, and five  cubits its breadth, and three cubits its height, and he  standeth upon it, and kneeleth on his knees over-against all  the assembly of Israel, and spreadeth forth his hands towards  the heavens --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> and saith, `O Jehovah God of Israel, there is not like Thee  a god in the heavens and in the earth, keeping the covenant and  the kindness for Thy servants who are walking before Thee with  all their heart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> who hast kept for Thy servant David my father that which  Thou didst speak to him; yea, Thou dost speak with Thy mouth,  and with Thy hand hast fulfilled [it], as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> `And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, keep for Thy servant  David my father that which Thou didst speak to him, saying,  There is not cut off to thee a man from before Me, sitting on  the throne of Israel, only, if thy sons watch their way to walk  in My law, as thou hast walked before Me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> `And now, O Jehovah, God of Israel, is Thy word stedfast  that Thou hast spoken to Thy servant, to David,</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:38">6:38</a> yea, they have turned back unto Thee with all their heart,  and with all their soul, in the land of their captivity,  whither they have taken them captive, and they have prayed the  way of their land that Thou hast given to their fathers, and of  the city that Thou hast chosen, and of the house that I have  built for Thy name:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:39">6:39</a> then Thou hast heard from the heavens, from the settled  place of Thy dwelling, their prayer and their supplications,  and hast maintained their cause, and forgiven Thy people who  have sinned against Thee.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And at Solomon's finishing to pray, then the fire hath come  down from the heavens, and consumeth the burnt-offering and the  sacrifices, and the honour of Jehovah hath filled the house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> and the priests have not been able to go in unto the house  of Jehovah, because the honour of Jehovah hath filled the  house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And all the sons of Israel are looking on the descending of  the fire, and the honour of Jehovah on the house, and they bow  -- faces to the earth -- on the pavement, and do obeisance, and  give thanks to Jehovah, for good, for to the age [is] His  kindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And the king and all the people are sacrificing a  sacrifice before Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> and king Solomon sacrificeth the sacrifice of the herd,  twenty and two thousand, and of the flock, a hundred and twenty  thousand, and the king and all the people dedicate the house of  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And the priests over their charges are standing, and the  Levites with instruments of the song of Jehovah -- that David  the king made, to give thanks to Jehovah, for to the age [is]  His kindness, in David's praising by their hand -- and the  priests are blowing trumpets over-against them, and all Israel  are standing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And Solomon sanctifieth the middle of the court that [is]  before the house of Jehovah, for he hath made there the  burnt-offerings, and the fat of the peace-offerings: for the  altar of brass that Solomon made hath not been able to contain  the burnt-offering, and the present, and the fat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And solomon maketh the feast at that time seven days, and  all Israel with him -- a very great assembly -- from the  entering in of Hamath unto the brook of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And they make on the eighth day a restraint, because the  dedication of the altar they have made seven days, and the  feast seven days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And on the twenty and third day of the seventh month he  hath sent the people to their tents, rejoicing, and glad in  heart, for the goodness that Jehovah hath done to David, and  to Solomon, and to Israel His people.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> and if ye turn back -- ye -- and have forsaken My statutes,  and My commands, that I have placed before you, and have gone  and served other gods, and bowed yourselves to them -- then I  have plucked them from off My ground that I have given to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> and this house that I have sanctified for My name, I cast  from before My face, and make it for a proverb, and for a  byword, among all the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> `And this house that hath been high, to every one passing  by it, is an astonishment, and he hath said, Wherefore hath  Jehovah done thus to this land, and to this house?</p>

 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And it cometh to pass, at the end of twenty years, that  Solomon hath built the house of Jehovah, and his own house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> As to the cities that Huram hath given to Solomon, Solomon  hath built them, and there he causeth the sons of Israel to  dwell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And Solomon goeth to Hamath-Zobah, and layeth hold upon  it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> and he buildeth Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the cities  of store that he hath built in Hamath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And he buildeth Beth-Horon the upper, and Beth-Horon the  lower -- cities of defence, with walls, two-leaved doors, and  bar --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> and Baalath, and all the cities of store that Solomon had,  and all the cities of the chariot, and the cities of the  horsemen, and all the desire of Solomon that he desired to  build in Jerusalem, and in Lebanon, and in all the land of his  dominion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> All the people who are left of the Hittite, and the Amorite,  and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite, who are  not of Israel --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> of their sons who have been left after them in the land,  whom the sons of Israel consumed not -- doth Solomon lift up a  tribute unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And none of the sons of Israel hath Solomon made servants  for his work, but they [are] men of war, and heads of his  captains, and heads of his charioteers, and of his horsemen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> and these [are] heads of the officers whom king Solomon  hath, two hundred and fifty who are rulers among the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And the daughter of Pharaoh hath Solomon brought up from  the city of David to the house that he built for her, for he  said, `My wife doth not dwell in the house of David king of  Israel, for they are holy unto whom hath come the ark of  Jehovah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Then hath Solomon caused to ascend burnt-offerings to  Jehovah on the altar of Jehovah that he built before the porch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> even by the matter of a day in its day, to cause to ascend  according to the command of Moses, on sabbaths, and on new  moons, and on appointed seasons, three times in a year -- in  the feast of unleavened things, and in the feast of weeks, and  in the feast of booths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And he establisheth, according to the ordinance of David  his father, the courses of the priests over their service, and  of the Levites over their charges, to praise and to minister  over-against the priests, according to the matter of a day in  its day, and the gatekeepers in their courses at gate and gate,  for so [is] the command of David the man of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And they have not turned aside [from] the command of the  king concerning the priests and the Levites, in reference to  any matter, and to the treasures.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And all the work of Solomon is prepared till the day of the  foundation of the house of Jehovah, and till its completion;  perfect is the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> Then hath Solomon gone to Ezion-Geber, and unto Elath, on  the border of the sea, in the land of Edom;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> and Huram sendeth to him, by the hand of his servants,  ships and servants knowing the sea, and they go with servants  of Solomon to Ophir, and take thence four hundred and fifty  talents of gold, and bring in unto king Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And the queen of Sheba hath heard of the fame of Solomon,  and cometh in to try Solomon with acute sayings, to Jerusalem,  with a very great company, and camels bearing spices and gold  in abundance, and precious stone; and she cometh in unto  Solomon, and speaketh with him all that hath been with her  heart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> and Solomon declareth to her all her matters, and there hath  not been hid a thing from Solomon that he hath not declared to  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And the queen of Sheba seeth the wisdom of Solomon, and the  house that he hath built,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> and the food of his table, and the sitting of his servants,  and the standing of his ministers, and their clothing, and his  stewards, and their clothing, an his burnt-offering that he  offered up in the house of Jehovah, and there hath not been any  more spirit in her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And she saith unto the king, `True [is] the word that I  heard in my land concerning thy matters and concerning thy  wisdom,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> and I have given no credence to their words, till that I  have come, and mine eyes see, and lo, there hath not been  declared to me the half of the abundance of thy wisdom -- thou  hast added unto the report that I heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> `O the happiness of thy men, and the happiness of thy  servants -- these -- who are standing before thee continually,  and hearing thy wisdom.</p>

 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And she giveth to the king a hundred and twenty talents of  gold, and spices in great abundance, and precious stone; and  there hath not been any such spice as the queen of Sheba hath  given to king Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And also, servants of Huram, and servants of Solomon, who  brought in gold from Ophir, have brought in algum-trees and  precious stone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And the king maketh the algum-trees staircases for the  house of Jehovah, and for the house of the king, and harps and  psalteries for singers; and there have been none seen like  these before in the land of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And king Solomon hath given to the queen of Sheba all her  desire that she asked, apart from that which she had brought  unto the king, and she turneth and goeth to her land, she and  her servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And the weight of the gold that is coming to Solomon in one  year is six hundred and sixty and six talents of gold,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> apart from [what] the tourists, and the merchants, are  bringing in; and all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of  the land, are bringing in gold and silver to Solomon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And king Solomon maketh two hundred targets of alloyed  gold, six hundred [shekels] of alloyed gold he causeth to go up  on the one target;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> and three hundred shields of alloyed gold, three hundred  [shekels] of gold he causeth to go up on the one shield, and  the king putteth them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And the king maketh a great throne of ivory, and overlayeth  it with pure gold;</p>

 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> and twelve lions are standing there on the six steps on  this [side], and on that: it hath not been made so for any  kingdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon [are] of gold,  and all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon [are]  of refined gold -- silver is not reckoned in the days of  Solomon for anything;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> for ships of the king are going to Tarshish, with servants  of Huram: once in three years come do the ships of Tarshish  bearing gold, and silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And king Solomon becometh greater than any of the kings of  the earth for riches and wisdom;</p>

 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And there are to Solomon four thousand stalls for horses  and chariots, and twelve thousand horsemen, and he placed them  in cities of the chariot, and with the king in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And he is ruling over all the kings from the River even  unto the land of the Philistines, and unto the border of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> And the king maketh the silver in Jerusalem as stones, and  the cedars he hath made as sycamores, that [are] in the low  country, for abundance,</p>

 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> And the rest of the matters of Solomon, the first and the  last, are they not written beside the matters of Nathan the  prophet, and beside the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and  with the visions of Iddo the seer concerning Jeroboam son of  Nebat?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> And Solomon reigneth in Jerusalem over all Israel forty  years,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> and Solomon lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in  the city of David his father, and reign doth Rehoboam his son  in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And Rehoboam goeth to Shechem, for [to] Shechem have all  Israel come to cause him to reign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> And it cometh to pass, at Jeroboam son of Nebat's -- who  [is] in Egypt because he hath fled from the face of Solomon the  king -- hearing, that Jeroboam turneth back out of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> and they send and call for him, and Jeroboam cometh in, and  all Israel, and speak unto Rehoboam, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And king Rehoboam consulteth with the aged men who have  been standing before Solomon his father in his being alive,  saying, `How are ye counselling to answer this people?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And they speak unto him, saying, `If thou dost become good  to this people, and hast been pleased with them, and spoken  unto them good words, then they have been to thee servants all  the days.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And he forsaketh the counsel of the aged men that they  counselled him, and consulteth with the lads who have grown up  with him, those standing before him,</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> And the king saith unto him, `How many times am I adjuring  thee, that thou speak unto me only truth in the name of  Jehovah?'</p>

 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> and they come up into Judah, and rend it, and take captive  all the substance that is found at the house of the king, and  also his sons, and his wives, and there hath not been left to  him a son except Jehoahaz the youngest of his sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> And after all this hath Jehovah plagued him in his bowels  by a disease for which there is no healing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> and it cometh to pass, from days to days, and at the time  of the going out of the end of two years, his bowels have gone  out with his sickness, and he dieth of sore diseases, and his  people have not made for him a burning like the burning of his  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> A son of thirty and two [years] was he in his reigning,  and eight years he hath reigned in Jerusalem, and he goeth  without desire, and they bury him in the city of David, and not  in the graves of the kings.</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> And he doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, like the  house of Ahab, for they have been his counsellors, after the  death of his father, for destruction to him.</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And he seeketh Ahaziah, and they capture him, (and he is  hiding himself in Samaria), and bring him in unto Jehu, and put  him to death, and bury him, for they said, `He [is] son of  Jehoshaphat, who sought Jehovah with all his heart;' and there  is none to the house of Ahaziah to retain power for the  kingdom.</p>

 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And he is with them in the house of God hiding himself six  years, and Athaliah is reigning over the land.</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> And the runners go with letters from the hand of the king  and his heads, into all Israel and Judah, even according to the  command of the king, saying, `O sons of Israel, turn back unto  Jehovah, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and He doth turn  back unto the escaped part that is left of you from the hand of  the kings of Asshur;</p>

 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> And they stand on their station according to their  ordinance; according to the law of Moses the man of God the  priests are sprinkling the blood out of the hand of the  Levites,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> for many [are] in the assembly who have not sanctified  themselves, and the Levites [are] over the slaughtering of the  passover-offerings for every one not clean, to sanctify [him]  to Jehovah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> for a multitude of the people, many from Ephraim and  Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, have not been cleansed, but  have eaten the passover otherwise than it is written; but  Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, `Jehovah, who [is] good, doth  receive atonement for every one</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> Hath not Hezekiah himself turned aside His high places,  and His altars, and speaketh to Judah and to Jerusalem, saying,  Before one altar ye bow yourselves, and on it ye make perfume?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> `Do ye not know what I have done -- I and my fathers -- to  all peoples of the lands? Were the gods of the nations of the  lands at all able to deliver their land out of my hand?</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> And again have his servants spoken against Jehovah God,  and against Hezekiah His servant,</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> And they call with a great voice [in] Jewish, against  the people of Jerusalem who [are] on the wall, to frighten  them, and to trouble them, that they may capture the city,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> and they speak against the God of Jerusalem as against the  gods of the peoples of the land -- work of the hands of man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And Hezekiah the king prayeth, and Isaiah son of Amoz the  prophet, concerning this, and they cry to the heavens,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> and Jehovah sendeth a messenger, and cutteth off every  mighty one of valour -- both leader and head -- in the camp of  the king of Asshur, and he turneth back with shame of face to  his land, and entereth the house of his god, and those coming  out of his bowels have caused him to fall there by the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> And Jehovah saveth Hezekiah and the inhabitants of  Jerusalem from the hand of Sennacherib king of Asshur, and from  the hand of all, and He leadeth them round about;</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> and Hezekiah hath not returned according to the deed  [done] unto him, for his heart hath been lofty, and there is  wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> and Hezekiah is humbled for the loftiness of his heart, he  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the wrath of Jehovah hath  not come upon them in the days of Hezekiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> And Hezekiah hath riches and honour very much, and  treasures he hath made to himself of silver, and of gold, and  of precious stone, and of spices, and of shields, and of all  [kinds] of desirable vessels,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> and storehouses for the increase of corn, and new wine,  and oil, and stalls for all kinds of cattle, and herds for  stalls;</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> and so with the ambassadors of the heads of Babylon, those  sending unto him to inquire of the wonder that hath been in the  land, God hath left him to try him, to know all in his heart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> And the rest of the matters of Hezekiah, and his kind  acts, lo, they are written in the vision of Isaiah son of Amoz  the prophet, on the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> And Hezekiah lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in  the uppermost of the graves of the sons of David, and all Judah  and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have done honour to him at his  death, and reign doth Manasseh his son in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> A son of twelve years is Manasseh in his reigning, and  fifty and five years he hath reigned in Jerusalem;</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> and he turneth and buildeth the high places that Hezekiah  his father hath broken down, and raiseth altars for Baalim, and  maketh shrines, and boweth himself to all the host of the  heavens, and serveth them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> And he hath built altars in the house of Jehovah of which  Jehovah had said, `In Jerusalem is My name to the age.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> And he hath caused his sons to pass over through fire in  the valley of the son of Hinnom, and observed clouds and used  enchantments and witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar spirit,  and a wizard; he hath multiplied to do the evil thing in the  eyes of Jehovah, to provoke him to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> And he placeth the graven image of the idol that he made in  the house of God, of which God said unto David, and unto  Solomon his son, `In this house, and in Jerusalem that I have  chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, I put My name to the  age,</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And Manasseh maketh Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem  to err, to do evil above the nations that Jehovah destroyed  from the presence of the sons of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> And Jehovah speaketh unto Manasseh and unto his people,  and they have not attended,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> and Jehovah bringeth in against them the heads of the host  that the king of Asshur hath, and they capture Manasseh among  the thickets, and bind him with brazen fetters, and cause him  to go to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> And when he is in distress he hath appeased the face of  Jehovah his God, and is humbled exceedingly before the God of  his fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> and prayeth unto Him, and He is entreated of him, and  heareth his supplication, and bringeth him back to Jerusalem,  to his kingdom, and Manasseh knoweth that Jehovah -- He [is]  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> And after this he hath built an outer wall to the city of  David, on the west of Gihon, in the valley, and at the entering  in at the fish-gate, and it hath gone round to the tower, and  he maketh it exceeding high, and he putteth heads of the force  in all the cities of the bulwarks in Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> And he turneth aside the gods of the stranger, and the  idol, out of the house of Jehovah, and all the altars that he  had built in the mount of the house of Jehovah and in  Jerusalem, and casteth [them] to the outside of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> And he buildeth the altar of Jehovah, and sacrificeth upon  it sacrifices of peace-offerings and thank-offering, and saith  to Judah to serve Jehovah, God of Israel;</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> And Manasseh lieth with his fathers, and they bury him in  his own house, and reign doth Amon his son in his stead.</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> and hath not been humbled before Jehovah, like the  humbling of Manasseh his father, for Amon himself hath  multiplied guilt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:24">33:24</a> And his servants conspire against him, and put him to  death in his own house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:25">33:25</a> and the people of the land smite all those conspiring  against king Amon, and the people of the land cause Josiah his  son to reign in his stead.</p>
