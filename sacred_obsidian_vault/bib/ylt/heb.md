  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Hebrews</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> In many parts, and many ways, God of old having spoken to  the fathers in the prophets,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> in these last days did speak to us in a Son, whom He  appointed heir of all things, through whom also He did make the  ages;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> who being the brightness of the glory, and the impress of  His subsistence, bearing up also the all things by the saying  of his might -- through himself having made a cleansing of our  sins, sat down at the right hand of the greatness in the  highest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> having become so much better than the messengers, as he did  inherit a more excellent name than they.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> For to which of the messengers said He ever, `My Son thou  art -- I to-day have begotten thee?' and again, `I will be to  him for a father, and he shall be to Me for a son?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> and when again He may bring in the first-born to the world,  He saith, `And let them bow before him -- all messengers of  God;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> and unto the messengers, indeed, He saith, `Who is making  His messengers spirits, and His ministers a flame of fire;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> and unto the Son: `Thy throne, O God, [is] to the age of the  age; a scepter of righteousness [is] the scepter of thy reign;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> thou didst love righteousness, and didst hate lawlessness;  because of this did He anoint thee -- God, thy God -- with oil  of gladness above thy partners;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> and, `Thou, at the beginning, Lord, the earth didst found,  and a work of thy hands are the heavens;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> these shall perish, and Thou dost remain, and all, as a  garment, shall become old,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> and as a mantle Thou shall roll them together, and they  shall be changed, and Thou art the same, and Thy years shall  not fail.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And unto which of the messengers said He ever, `Sit at My  right hand, till I may make thine enemies thy footstool?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> are they not all spirits of service -- for ministration  being sent forth because of those about to inherit salvation?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Because of this it behoveth [us] more abundantly to take  heed to the things heard, lest we may glide aside,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> for if the word being spoken through messengers did become  stedfast, and every transgression and disobedience did receive  a just recompense,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> how shall we escape, having neglected so great salvation?  which a beginning receiving -- to be spoken through the Lord  -- by those having heard was confirmed to us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> God also bearing joint-witness both with signs and wonders,  and manifold powers, and distributions of the Holy Spirit,  according to His will.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> For not to messengers did He subject the coming world,  concerning which we speak,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and one in a certain place did testify fully, saying, `What  is man, that Thou art mindful of him, or a son of man, that  Thou dost look after him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Thou didst make him some little less than messengers, with  glory and honour Thou didst crown him, and didst set him over  the works of Thy hands,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> all things Thou didst put in subjection under his feet,' for  in the subjecting to him the all things, nothing did He leave  to him unsubjected, and now not yet do we see the all things  subjected to him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and him who was made some little less than messengers we see  -- Jesus -- because of the suffering of the death, with glory  and honour having been crowned, that by the grace of God for  every one he might taste of death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> For it was becoming to Him, because of whom [are] the all  things, and through whom [are] the all things, many sons to  glory bringing, the author of their salvation through  sufferings to make perfect,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> for both he who is sanctifying and those sanctified [are]  all of one, for which cause he is not ashamed to call them  brethren,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> saying, `I will declare Thy name to my brethren, in the  midst of an assembly I will sing praise to Thee;' and again,  `I will be trusting on Him;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> and again, `Behold I and the children that God did give to  me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Seeing, then, the children have partaken of flesh and  blood, he himself also in like manner did take part of the  same, that through death he might destroy him having the power  of death -- that is, the devil --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> and might deliver those, whoever, with fear of death,  throughout all their life, were subjects of bondage,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> for, doubtless, of messengers it doth not lay hold, but of  seed of Abraham it layeth hold,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> wherefore it did behove him in all things to be made like  to the brethren, that he might become a kind and stedfast  chief-priest in the things with God, to make propitiation for  the sins of the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> for in that he suffered, himself being tempted, he is able  to help those who are tempted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of a heavenly calling,  consider the apostle and chief priest of our profession,  Christ Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> being stedfast to Him who did appoint him, as also Moses in  all his house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> for of more glory than Moses hath this one been counted  worthy, inasmuch as more honour than the house hath he who doth  build it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> for every house is builded by some one, and He who the all  things did build [is] God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> and Moses indeed [was] stedfast in all his house, as an  attendant, for a testimony of those things that were to be  spoken,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> and Christ, as a Son over his house, whose house are we, if  the boldness and the rejoicing of the hope unto the end we  hold fast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Wherefore, (as the Holy Spirit saith, `To-day, if His voice  ye may hear --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> ye may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation, in the  day of the temptation in the wilderness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> in which tempt Me did your fathers, they did prove Me, and  saw My works forty years;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said,  Always do they go astray in heart, and these have not known My  ways;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> so I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest --  !')</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> See, brethren, lest there shall be in any of you an evil  heart of unbelief in the falling away from the living God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> but exhort ye one another every day, while the To-day is  called, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness  of the sin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> for partakers we have become of the Christ, if the  beginning of the confidence unto the end we may hold fast,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> in its being said, `To-day, if His voice ye may hear, ye  may not harden your hearts, as in the provocation,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> for certain having heard did provoke, but not all who did  come out of Egypt through Moses;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> but with whom was He grieved forty years? was it not with  those who did sin, whose carcasses fell in the wilderness?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> and to whom did He swear that they shall not enter into His  rest, except to those who did not believe? --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> and we see that they were not able to enter in because of  unbelief.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> We may fear, then, lest a promise being left of entering  into His rest, any one of you may seem to have come short,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> for we also are having good news proclaimed, even as they,  but the word heard did not profit them, not being mixed with  faith in those who heard,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> for we do enter into the rest -- we who did believe, as He  said, `So I sware in My anger, If they shall enter into My rest  -- ;' and yet the works were done from the foundation of the  world,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> for He spake in a certain place concerning the seventh [day]  thus: `And God did rest in the seventh day from all His works;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> and in this [place] again, `If they shall enter into My rest  -- ;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> since then, it remaineth for certain to enter into it, and  those who did first hear good news entered not in because of  unbelief --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> again He doth limit a certain day, `To-day,' (in David  saying, after so long a time,) as it hath been said, `To-day,  if His voice ye may hear, ye may not harden your hearts,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> for if Joshua had given them rest, He would not concerning  another day have spoken after these things;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> there doth remain, then, a sabbatic rest to the people of  God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> for he who did enter into his rest, he also rested from his  works, as God from His own.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> May we be diligent, then, to enter into that rest, that no  one in the same example of the unbelief may fall,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> for the reckoning of God is living, and working, and sharp  above every two-edged sword, and piercing unto the dividing  asunder both of soul and spirit, of joints also and marrow,  and a discerner of thoughts and intents of the heart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> and there is not a created thing not manifest before Him,  but all things [are] naked and open to His eyes -- with whom  is our reckoning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Having, then, a great chief priest passed through the  heavens -- Jesus the Son of God -- may we hold fast the  profession,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> for we have not a chief priest unable to sympathise with  our infirmities, but [one] tempted in all things in like  manner -- apart from sin;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> we may come near, then, with freedom, to the throne of the  grace, that we may receive kindness, and find grace -- for  seasonable help.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> For every chief priest -- out of men taken -- in behalf of  men is set in things [pertaining] to God, that he may offer  both gifts and sacrifices for sins,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> able to be gentle to those ignorant and going astray, since  himself also is compassed with infirmity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> and because of this infirmity he ought, as for the people,  so also for himself to offer for sins;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> and no one to himself doth take the honour, but he who is  called by God, as also Aaron:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> so also the Christ did not glorify himself to become chief  priest, but He who spake unto him: `My Son thou art, I to-day  have begotten thee;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> as also in another [place] He saith, `Thou [art] a priest --  to the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> who in the days of his flesh both prayers and supplications  unto Him who was able to save him from death -- with strong  crying and tears -- having offered up, and having been heard  in respect to that which he feared,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> through being a Son, did learn by the things which he  suffered -- the obedience,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> and having been made perfect, he did become to all those  obeying him a cause of salvation age-during,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> having been addressed by God a chief priest, according to  the order of Melchisedek,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> concerning whom we have much discourse and of hard  explanation to say, since ye have become dull of hearing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> for even owing to be teachers, because of the time, again  ye have need that one teach you what [are] the elements of the  beginning of the oracles of God, and ye have become having  need of milk, and not of strong food,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> for every one who is partaking of milk [is] unskilled in  the word of righteousness -- for he is an infant,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> and of perfect men is the strong food, who because of the  use are having the senses exercised, unto the discernment both  of good and of evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Wherefore, having left the word of the beginning of the  Christ, unto the perfection we may advance, not again a  foundation laying of reformation from dead works, and of faith  on God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> of the teaching of baptisms, of laying on also of hands, of  rising again also of the dead, and of judgment age-during,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> and this we will do, if God may permit,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> for [it is] impossible for those once enlightened, having  tasted also of the heavenly gift, and partakers having became  of the Holy Spirit,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> and did taste the good saying of God, the powers also of the  coming age,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> and having fallen away, again to renew [them] to  reformation, having crucified again to themselves the Son of  God, and exposed to public shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> For earth, that is drinking in the rain many times coming  upon it, and is bringing forth herbs fit for those because of  whom also it is dressed, doth partake of blessing from God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> and that which is bearing thorns and briers [is] disapproved  of, and nigh to cursing, whose end [is] for burning;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> and we are persuaded, concerning you, beloved, the things  that are better, and accompanying salvation, though even thus  we speak,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> for God is not unrighteous to forget your work, and the  labour of the love, that ye shewed to His name, having  ministered to the saints and ministering;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> and we desire each one of you the same diligence to shew,  unto the full assurance of the hope unto the end,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> that ye may not become slothful, but followers of those who  through faith and patient endurance are inheriting the  promises.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> For to Abraham God, having made promise, seeing He was able  to swear by no greater, did swear by Himself,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> saying, `Blessing indeed I will bless thee, and multiplying  I will multiply thee;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> and so, having patiently endured, he did obtain the  promise;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> for men indeed do swear by the greater, and an end of all  controversy to them for confirmation [is] the oath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> in which God, more abundantly willing to shew to the heirs  of the promise the immutability of his counsel, did interpose  by an oath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> that through two immutable things, in which [it is]  impossible for God to lie, a strong comfort we may have who  did flee for refuge to lay hold on the hope set before [us],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> which we have, as an anchor of the soul, both sure and  stedfast, and entering into that within the vail,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> whither a forerunner for us did enter -- Jesus, after the  order of Melchisedek chief priest having become -- to the age.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> For this Melchisedek, king of Salem, priest of God Most  High, who did meet Abraham turning back from the smiting of  the kings, and did bless him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> to whom also a tenth of all did Abraham divide, (first,  indeed, being interpreted, `King of righteousness,' and then  also, King of Salem, which is, King of Peace,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> without father, without mother, without genealogy, having  neither beginning of days nor end of life, and being made like  to the Son of God, doth remain a priest continually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And see how great this one [is], to whom also a tenth  Abraham the patriarch did give out of the best of the spoils,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> and those, indeed, out of the sons of Levi receiving the  priesthood, a command have to take tithes from the people  according to the law, that is, their brethren, even though  they came forth out of the loins of Abraham;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> and he who was not reckoned by genealogy of them, received  tithes from Abraham, and him having the promises he hath  blessed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> and apart from all controversy, the less by the better is  blessed --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> and here, indeed, men who die do receive tithes, and there  [he], who is testified to that he was living,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> and so to speak, through Abraham even Levi who is receiving  tithes, hath paid tithes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> for he was yet in the loins of the father when Melchisedek  met him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> If indeed, then, perfection were through the Levitical  priesthood -- for the people under it had received law -- what  further need, according to the order of Melchisedek, for  another priest to arise, and not to be called according to the  order of Aaron?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> for the priesthood being changed, of necessity also, of the  law a change doth come,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> for he of whom these things are said in another tribe hath  had part, of whom no one gave attendance at the altar,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> for [it is] evident that out of Judah hath arisen our Lord,  in regard to which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning  priesthood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And it is yet more abundantly most evident, if according to  the similitude of Melchisedek there doth arise another priest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> who came not according to the law of a fleshly command, but  according to the power of an endless life,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> for He doth testify -- `Thou [art] a priest -- to the age,  according to the order of Melchisedek;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> for a disannulling indeed doth come of the command going  before because of its weakness, and unprofitableness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> (for nothing did the law perfect) and the bringing in of a  better hope, through which we draw nigh to God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And inasmuch as [it is] not apart from oath, (for those  indeed apart from oath are become priests,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> and he with an oath through Him who is saying unto him,  `The Lord sware, and will not repent, Thou [art] a priest -- to  the age, according to the order of Melchisedek;')</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> by so much of a better covenant hath Jesus become surety,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> and those indeed are many who have become priests, because  by death they are hindered from remaining;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> and he, because of his remaining -- to the age, hath the  priesthood not transient,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> whence also he is able to save to the very end, those  coming through him unto God -- ever living to make intercession  for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> For such a chief priest did become us -- kind, harmless,  undefiled, separate from the sinners, and become higher than  the heavens,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> who hath no necessity daily, as the chief priests, first  for his own sins to offer up sacrifice, then for those of the  people; for this he did once, having offered up himself;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:28">7:28</a> for the law doth appoint men chief priests, having  infirmity, but the word of the oath that [is] after the law  [appointeth] the Son -- to the age having been perfected.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And the sum concerning the things spoken of [is]: we have  such a chief priest, who did sit down at the right hand of the  throne of the greatness in the heavens,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> of the holy places a servant, and of the true tabernacle,  which the Lord did set up, and not man,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> for every chief priest to offer both gifts and sacrifices is  appointed, whence [it is] necessary for this one to have also  something that he may offer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> for if, indeed, he were upon earth, he would not be a priest  -- (there being the priests who are offering according to the  law, the gifts,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> who unto an example and shadow do serve of the heavenly  things, as Moses hath been divinely warned, being about to  construct the tabernacle, for `See (saith He) thou mayest make  all things according to the pattern that was shewn to thee in  the mount;') --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> and now he hath obtained a more excellent service, how much  also of a better covenant is he mediator, which on better  promises hath been sanctioned,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> for if that first were faultless, a place would not have  been sought for a second.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> For finding fault, He saith to them, `Lo, days come, saith  the Lord, and I will complete with the house of Israel, and  with the house of Judah, a new covenant,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> not according to the covenant that I made with their  fathers, in the day of My taking [them] by their hand, to bring  them out of the land of Egypt -- because they did not remain in  My covenant, and I did not regard them, saith the Lord, --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> because this [is] the covenant that I will make with the  house of Israel, after those days, saith the Lord, giving My  laws into their mind, and upon their hearts I will write them,  and I will be to them for a God, and they shall be to Me for a  people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> and they shall not teach each his neighbour, and each his  brother, saying, Know thou the Lord, because they shall all  know Me from the small one of them unto the great one of them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> because I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and  their sins and their lawlessnesses I will remember no more;'  --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> in the saying `new,' He hath made the first old, and what  doth become obsolete and is old [is] nigh disappearing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> It had, indeed, then (even the first tabernacle) ordinances  of service, also a worldly sanctuary,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> for a tabernacle was prepared, the first, in which was both  the lamp-stand, and the table, and the bread of the presence --  which is called `Holy;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> and after the second vail a tabernacle that is called `Holy  of holies,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> having a golden censer, and the ark of the covenant overlaid  all round about with gold, in which [is] the golden pot having  the manna, and the rod of Aaron that budded, and the tables of  the covenant,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> and over it cherubim of the glory, overshadowing the  mercy-seat, concerning which we are not now to speak  particularly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And these things having been thus prepared, into the first  tabernacle, indeed, at all times the priests do go in,  performing the services,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> and into the second, once in the year, only the chief  priest, not apart from blood, which he doth offer for himself  and the errors of the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> the Holy Spirit this evidencing that not yet hath been  manifested the way of the holy [places], the first tabernacle  having yet a standing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> which [is] a simile in regard to the present time, in which  both gifts and sacrifices are offered, which are not able, in  regard to conscience, to make perfect him who is serving,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> only in victuals, and drinks, and different baptisms, and  fleshly ordinances -- till the time of reformation imposed  upon [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And Christ being come, chief priest of the coming good  things, through the greater and more perfect tabernacle not  made with hands -- that is, not of this creation --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> neither through blood of goats and calves, but through his  own blood, did enter in once into the holy places, age-during  redemption having obtained;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> for if the blood of bulls, and goats, and ashes of an  heifer, sprinkling those defiled, doth sanctify to the  purifying of the flesh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> how much more shall the blood of the Christ (who through  the age-during Spirit did offer himself unblemished to God)  purify your conscience from dead works to serve the living  God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And because of this, of a new covenant he is mediator,  that, death having come, for redemption of the transgressions  under the first covenant, those called may receive the promise  of the age-during inheritance,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> for where a covenant [is], the death of the covenant-victim  to come in is necessary,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> for a covenant over dead victims [is] stedfast, since it is  no force at all when the covenant-victim liveth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> whence not even the first apart from blood hath been  initiated,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> for every command having been spoken, according to law, by  Moses, to all the people, having taken the blood of the calves  and goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, he both  the book itself and all the people did sprinkle,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> saying, `This [is] the blood of the covenant that God  enjoined unto you,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> and both the tabernacle and all the vessels of the service  with blood in like manner he did sprinkle,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> and with blood almost all things are purified according to  the law, and apart from blood-shedding forgiveness doth not  come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> [It is] necessary, therefore, the pattern indeed of the  things in the heavens to be purified with these, and the  heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> for not into holy places made with hands did the Christ  enter -- figures of the true -- but into the heaven itself, now  to be manifested in the presence of God for us;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> nor that he may many times offer himself, even as the chief  priest doth enter into the holy places every year with blood of  others;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> since it had behoved him many times to suffer from the  foundation of the world, but now once, at the full end of the  ages, for putting away of sin through his sacrifice, he hath  been manifested;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> and as it is laid up to men once to die, and after this --  judgment,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> so also the Christ, once having been offered to bear the  sins of many, a second time, apart from a sin-offering, shall  appear, to those waiting for him -- to salvation!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> For the law having a shadow of the coming good things --  not the very image of the matters, every year, by the same  sacrifices that they offer continually, is never able to make  perfect those coming near,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> since, would they not have ceased to be offered, because of  those serving having no more conscience of sins, having once  been purified?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> but in those [sacrifices] is a remembrance of sins every  year,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> for it is impossible for blood of bulls and goats to take  away sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> Wherefore, coming into the world, he saith, `Sacrifice and  offering Thou didst not will, and a body Thou didst prepare  for me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> in burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offerings, Thou  didst not delight,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> then I said, Lo, I come, (in a volume of the book it hath  been written concerning me,) to do, O God, Thy will;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> saying above -- `Sacrifice, and offering, and  burnt-offerings, and concerning sin-offering Thou didst not  will, nor delight in,' -- which according to the law are  offered --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> then he said, `Lo, I come to do, O God, Thy will;' he doth  take away the first that the second he may establish;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> in the which will we are having been sanctified through  the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> and every priest, indeed, hath stood daily serving, and  the same sacrifices many times offering, that are never able to  take away sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And He, for sin one sacrifice having offered -- to the  end, did sit down on the right hand of God, --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> as to the rest, expecting till He may place his enemies  [as] his footstool,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> for by one offering he hath perfected to the end those  sanctified;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> and testify to us also doth the Holy Spirit, for after  that He hath said before,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> `This [is] the covenant that I will make with them after  those days, saith the Lord, giving My laws on their hearts, and  upon their minds I will write them,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> and `their sins and their lawlessness I will remember no  more;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> and where forgiveness of these [is], there is no more  offering for sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> Having, therefore, brethren, boldness for the entrance  into the holy places, in the blood of Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> which way he did initiate for us -- new and living,  through the vail, that is, his flesh --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> and a high priest over the house of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> may we draw near with a true heart, in full assurance of  faith, having the hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience,  and having the body bathed with pure water;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> may we hold fast the unwavering profession of the hope,  (for faithful [is] He who did promise),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> and may we consider one another to provoke to love and to  good works,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as a  custom of certain [is], but exhorting, and so much the more as  ye see the day coming nigh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> For we -- willfully sinning after the receiving the full  knowledge of the truth -- no more for sins doth there remain a  sacrifice,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> but a certain fearful looking for of judgment, and fiery  zeal, about to devour the opposers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> any one who did set at nought a law of Moses, apart from  mercies, by two or three witnesses, doth die,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> of how much sorer punishment shall he be counted worthy  who the Son of God did trample on, and the blood of the  covenant did count a common thing, in which he was sanctified,  and to the Spirit of the grace did despite?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:30">10:30</a> for we have known Him who is saying, `Vengeance [is] Mine,  I will recompense, saith the Lord;' and again, `The Lord shall  judge His people;' --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:31">10:31</a> fearful [is] the falling into the hands of a living God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:32">10:32</a> And call to your remembrance the former days, in which,  having been enlightened, ye did endure much conflict of  sufferings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:33">10:33</a> partly both with reproaches and tribulations being made  spectacles, and partly having become partners of those so  living,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:34">10:34</a> for also with my bonds ye sympathised, and the robbery of  your goods with joy ye did receive, knowing that ye have in  yourselves a better substance in the heavens, and an enduring  one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:35">10:35</a> Ye may not cast away, then, your boldness, which hath  great recompense of reward,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:36">10:36</a> for of patience ye have need, that the will of God having  done, ye may receive the promise,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:37">10:37</a> for yet a very very little, He who is coming will come,  and will not tarry;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:38">10:38</a> and `the righteous by faith shall live,' and `if he may  draw back, My soul hath no pleasure in him,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:39">10:39</a> and we are not of those drawing back to destruction, but  of those believing to a preserving of soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And faith is of things hoped for a confidence, of matters  not seen a conviction,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> for in this were the elders testified of;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> by faith we understand the ages to have been prepared by a  saying of God, in regard to the things seen not having come  out of things appearing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> by faith a better sacrifice did Abel offer to God than  Cain, through which he was testified to be righteous, God  testifying of his gifts, and through it, he being dead, doth  yet speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> By faith Enoch was translated -- not to see death, and was  not found, because God did translate him; for before his  translation he had been testified to -- that he had pleased  God well,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> and apart from faith it is impossible to please well, for  it behoveth him who is coming to God to believe that He is,  and to those seeking Him He becometh a rewarder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> By faith Noah, having been divinely warned concerning the  things not yet seen, having feared, did prepare an ark to the  salvation of his house, through which he did condemn the  world, and of the righteousness according to faith he became  heir.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> By faith Abraham, being called, did obey, to go forth to  the place that he was about to receive for an inheritance, and  he went forth, not knowing whither he doth go;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> by faith he did sojourn in the land of the promise as a  strange country, in tabernacles having dwelt with Isaac and  Jacob, fellow-heirs of the same promise,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> for he was looking for the city having the foundations,  whose artificer and constructor [is] God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> By faith also Sarah herself did receive power to conceive  seed, and she bare after the time of life, seeing she did  judge Him faithful who did promise;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> wherefore, also from one were begotten -- and that of one  who had become dead -- as the stars of the heaven in multitude,  and as sand that [is] by the sea-shore -- the innumerable.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> In faith died all these, not having received the promises,  but from afar having seen them, and having been persuaded, and  having saluted [them], and having confessed that strangers and  sojourners they are upon the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> for those saying such things make manifest that they seek  a country;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> and if, indeed, they had been mindful of that from which  they came forth, they might have had an opportunity to return,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> but now they long for a better, that is, an heavenly,  wherefore God is not ashamed of them, to be called their God,  for He did prepare for them a city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> By faith Abraham hath offered up Isaac, being tried, and  the only begotten he did offer up who did receive the  promises,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> of whom it was said -- `In Isaac shall a seed be called to  thee;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> reckoning that even out of the dead God is able to raise  up, whence also in a figure he did receive [him].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> By faith, concerning coming things, Isaac did bless Jacob  and Esau;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> by faith Jacob dying -- each of the sons of Joseph did  bless, and did bow down upon the top of his staff;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> by faith, Joseph dying, concerning the outgoing of the  sons of Israel did make mention, and concerning his bones did  give command.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> By faith Moses, having been born, was hid three months by  his parents, because they saw the child comely, and were not  afraid of the decree of the king;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> by faith Moses, having become great, did refuse to be  called a son of the daughter of Pharaoh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> having chosen rather to be afflicted with the people of  God, than to have sin's pleasure for a season,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> greater wealth having reckoned the reproach of the Christ  than the treasures in Egypt, for he did look to the recompense  of reward;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> by faith he left Egypt behind, not having been afraid of  the wrath of the king, for, as seeing the Invisible One -- he  endured;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> by faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of the  blood, that He who is destroying the first-born might not  touch them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> By faith they did pass through the Red Sea as through dry  land, which the Egyptians having received a trial of, were  swallowed up;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> by faith the walls of Jericho did fall, having been  surrounded for seven days;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:31">11:31</a> by faith Rahab the harlot did not perish with those who  disbelieved, having received the spies with peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:32">11:32</a> And what shall I yet say? for the time will fail me  recounting about Gideon, Barak also, and Samson, and Jephthah,  David also, and Samuel, and the prophets,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:33">11:33</a> who through faith did subdue kingdoms, wrought  righteousness, obtained promises, stopped mouths of lions,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:34">11:34</a> quenched the power of fire, escaped the mouth of the  sword, were made powerful out of infirmities, became strong in  battle, caused to give way camps of the aliens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:35">11:35</a> Women received by a rising again their dead, and others  were tortured, not accepting the redemption, that a better  rising again they might receive,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:36">11:36</a> and others of mockings and scourgings did receive trial,  and yet of bonds and imprisonment;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:37">11:37</a> they were stoned, they were sawn asunder, they were tried;  in the killing of the sword they died; they went about in  sheepskins, in goatskins -- being destitute, afflicted,  injuriously treated,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:38">11:38</a> of whom the world was not worthy; in deserts wandering,  and [in] mountains, and [in] caves, and [in] the holes of the  earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:39">11:39</a> and these all, having been testified to through the faith,  did not receive the promise,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:40">11:40</a> God for us something better having provided, that apart  from us they might not be made perfect.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> Therefore, we also having so great a cloud of witnesses set  around us, every weight having put off, and the closely  besetting sin, through endurance may we run the contest that  is set before us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> looking to the author and perfecter of faith -- Jesus, who,  over-against the joy set before him -- did endure a cross,  shame having despised, on the right hand also of the throne of  God did sit down;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> for consider again him who endured such gainsaying from the  sinners to himself, that ye may not be wearied in your souls  -- being faint.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> Not yet unto blood did ye resist -- with the sin striving;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> and ye have forgotten the exhortation that doth speak fully  with you as with sons, `My son, be not despising chastening of  the Lord, nor be faint, being reproved by Him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> for whom the Lord doth love He doth chasten, and He  scourgeth every son whom He receiveth;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> if chastening ye endure, as to sons God beareth Himself to  you, for who is a son whom a father doth not chasten?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> and if ye are apart from chastening, of which all have  become partakers, then bastards are ye, and not sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> Then, indeed, fathers of our flesh we have had, chastising  [us], and we were reverencing [them]; shall we not much rather  be subject to the Father of the spirits, and live?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> for they, indeed, for a few days, according to what seemed  good to them, were chastening, but He for profit, to be  partakers of His separation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> and all chastening for the present, indeed, doth not seem  to be of joy, but of sorrow, yet afterward the peaceable fruit  of righteousness to those exercised through it -- it doth  yield.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> Wherefore, the hanging-down hands and the loosened knees  set ye up;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> and straight paths make for your feet, that that which is  lame may not be turned aside, but rather be healed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> peace pursue with all, and the separation, apart from  which no one shall see the Lord,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> looking diligently over lest any one be failing of the  grace of God, lest any root of bitterness springing up may  give trouble, and through this many may be defiled;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> lest any one be a fornicator, or a profane person, as  Esau, who in exchange for one morsel of food did sell his  birthright,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> for ye know that also afterwards, wishing to inherit the  blessing, he was disapproved of, for a place of reformation he  found not, though with tears having sought it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> For ye came not near to the mount touched and scorched  with fire, and to blackness, and darkness, and tempest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> and a sound of a trumpet, and a voice of sayings, which  those having heard did entreat that a word might not be added  to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> for they were not bearing that which is commanded, `And if  a beast may touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or with an  arrow shot through,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> and, (so terrible was the sight,) Moses said, `I am  fearful exceedingly, and trembling.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> But, ye came to Mount Zion, and to a city of the living  God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, and to myriads of messengers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> to the company and assembly of the first-born in heaven  enrolled, and to God the judge of all, and to spirits of  righteous men made perfect,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> and to a mediator of a new covenant -- Jesus, and to blood  of sprinkling, speaking better things than that of Abel!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> See, may ye not refuse him who is speaking, for if those  did not escape who refused him who upon earth was divinely  speaking -- much less we who do turn away from him who  [speaketh] from heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:26">12:26</a> whose voice the earth shook then, and now hath he  promised, saying, `Yet once -- I shake not only the earth, but  also the heaven;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:27">12:27</a> and this -- `Yet once' -- doth make evident the removal of  the things shaken, as of things having been made, that the  things not shaken may remain;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> wherefore, a kingdom that cannot be shaken receiving, may  we have grace, through which we may serve God well-pleasingly,  with reverence and religious fear;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:29">12:29</a> for also our God [is] a consuming fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> Let brotherly love remain;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> of the hospitality be not forgetful, for through this  unawares certain did entertain messengers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> be mindful of those in bonds, as having been bound with  them, of those maltreated, as also yourselves being in the  body;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> honourable [is] the marriage in all, and the bed undefiled,  and whoremongers and adulterers God shall judge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> Without covetousness the behaviour, being content with the  things present, for He hath said, `No, I will not leave, no,  nor forsake thee,'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> so that we do boldly say, `The Lord [is] to me a helper,  and I will not fear what man shall do to me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Be mindful of those leading you, who did speak to you the  word of God, whose faith -- considering the issue of the  behaviour -- be imitating,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> Jesus Christ yesterday and to-day the same, and to the  ages;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> with teachings manifold and strange be not carried about,  for [it is] good that by grace the heart be confirmed, not  with meats, in which they who were occupied were not profited;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> we have an altar, of which to eat they have no authority  who the tabernacle are serving,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> for of those beasts whose blood is brought for sin into  the holy places through the chief priest -- of these the  bodies are burned without the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> Wherefore, also Jesus -- that he might sanctify through  [his] own blood the people -- without the gate did suffer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> now, then, may we go forth unto him without the camp, his  reproach bearing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> for we have not here an abiding city, but the coming one  we seek;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> through him, then, we may offer up a sacrifice of praise  always to God, that is, the fruit of lips, giving thanks to  His name;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> and of doing good, and of fellowship, be not forgetful,  for with such sacrifices God is well-pleased.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> Be obedient to those leading you, and be subject, for  these do watch for your souls, as about to give account, that  with joy they may do this, and not sighing, for this [is]  unprofitable to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> Pray for us, for we trust that we have a good conscience,  in all things willing to behave well,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> and more abundantly do I call upon [you] to do this, that  more quickly I may be restored to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> And the God of the peace, who did bring up out of the dead  the great shepherd of the sheep -- in the blood of an  age-during covenant -- our Lord Jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> make you perfect in every good work to do His will, doing  in you that which is well-pleasing before Him, through Jesus  Christ, to whom [is] the glory -- to the ages of the ages!  Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And I entreat you, brethren, suffer the word of the  exhortation, for also through few words I have written to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> Know ye that the brother Timotheus is released, with whom,  if he may come more shortly, I will see you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> Salute all those leading you, and all the saints; salute  you doth those from Italy:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> the grace [is] with you all! Amen. </p>
