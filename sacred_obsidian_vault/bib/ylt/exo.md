  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Exodus</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And these [are] the names of the sons of Israel who are  coming into Egypt with Jacob; a man and his household have they  come;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And all the persons coming out of the thigh of Jacob are  seventy persons; as to Joseph, he was in Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And Joseph dieth, and all his brethren, and all that  generation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> and the sons of Israel have been fruitful, and they teem,  and multiply, and are very very mighty, and the land is filled  with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And there riseth a new king over Egypt, who hath not known  Joseph,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> and he saith unto his people, `Lo, the people of the sons of  Israel [is] more numerous and mighty than we;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> give help! let us act wisely concerning it, lest it  multiply, and it hath come to pass, when war happeneth, that it  hath been joined, even it, unto those hating us, and hath  fought against us, and hath gone out up of the land.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And they set over it princes of tribute, so as to afflict  it with their burdens, and it buildeth store-cities for  Pharaoh, Pithom and Raamses;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> and as they afflict it, so it multiplieth, and so it  breaketh forth, and they are vexed because of the sons of  Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> and the Egyptians cause the sons of Israel to serve with  rigour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and make their lives bitter in hard service, in clay, and  in brick, and in every [kind] of service in the field; all  their service in which they have served [is] with rigour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And the king of Egypt speaketh to the midwives, the  Hebrewesses, (of whom the name of the one [is] Shiphrah, and  the name of the second Puah),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and saith, `When ye cause the Hebrew women to bear, and  have looked on the children; if it [is] a son -- then ye have  put him to death; and if it [is] a daughter -- then she hath  lived.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And the midwives fear God, and have not done as the king of  Egypt hath spoken unto them, and keep the lads alive;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> and the king of Egypt calleth for the midwives, and saith  to them, `Wherefore have ye done this thing, and keep the lads  alive?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And the midwives say unto Pharaoh, `Because the Hebrew  women [are] not as the Egyptian women, for they [are] lively;  before the midwife cometh in unto them -- they have borne!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And God doth good to the midwives, and the people multiply,  and are very mighty;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> and it cometh to pass, because the midwives have feared  God, that He maketh for them households;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> and Pharaoh layeth a charge on all his people, saying,  `Every son who is born -- into the River ye do cast him, and  every daughter ye do keep alive.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And there goeth a man of the house of Levi, and he taketh  the daughter of Levi,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and the woman conceiveth, and beareth a son, and she seeth  him that he [is] fair, and she hideth him three months,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> and she hath not been able any more to hide him, and she  taketh for him an ark of rushes, and daubeth it with bitumen  and with pitch, and putteth the lad in it, and putteth [it] in  the weeds by the edge of the River;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> and his sister stationeth herself afar off, to know what is  done to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And a daughter of Pharaoh cometh down to bathe at the River,  and her damsels are walking by the side of the River, and she  seeth the ark in the midst of the weeds, and sendeth her  handmaid, and she taketh it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> and openeth, and seeth him -- the lad, and lo, a child  weeping! and she hath pity on him, and saith, `This is [one] of  the Hebrews' children.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And his sister saith unto the daughter of Pharaoh, `Do I go?  when I have called for thee a suckling woman of the Hebrews,  then she doth suckle the lad for thee;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and the daughter of Pharaoh saith to her, `Go;' and the  virgin goeth, and calleth the mother of the lad,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and the daughter of Pharaoh saith to her, `Take this lad  away, and suckle him for me, and I -- I give thy hire;' and the  woman taketh the lad, and suckleth him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And the lad groweth, and she bringeth him in to the  daughter of Pharaoh, and he is to her for a son, and she  calleth his name Moses, and saith, `Because -- from the water I  have drawn him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And it cometh to pass, in those days, that Moses is grown,  and he goeth out unto his brethren, and looketh on their  burdens, and seeth a man, an Egyptian, smiting a man, a Hebrew,  [one] of his brethren,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> and he turneth hither and thither, and seeth that there is  no man, and smiteth the Egyptian, and hideth him in the sand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And he goeth out on the second day, and lo, two men,  Hebrews, striving! and he saith to the wrong-doer, `Why dost  thou smite thy neighbour?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> and he saith, `Who set thee for a head and a judge over us?  to slay me art thou saying [it], as thou hast slain the  Egyptian?' and Moses feareth, and saith, `Surely the thing hath  been known.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And Pharaoh heareth of this thing, and seeketh to slay  Moses, and Moses fleeth from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelleth  in the land of Midian, and dwelleth by the well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And to a priest of Midian [are] seven daughters, and they  come and draw, and fill the troughs, to water the flock of  their father,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> and the shepherds come and drive them away, and Moses  ariseth, and saveth them, and watereth their flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And they come in to Reuel their father, and he saith,  `Wherefore have ye hastened to come in to-day?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> and they say, `A man, an Egyptian, hath delivered us out of  the hand of the shepherds, and also hath diligently drawn for  us, and watereth the flock;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> and he saith unto his daughters, `And where [is] he? why  [is] this? -- ye left the man! call for him, and he doth eat  bread.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And Moses is willing to dwell with the man, and he giveth  Zipporah his daughter to Moses,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> and she beareth a son, and he calleth his name Gershom, for  he said, `A sojourner I have been in a strange land.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And it cometh to pass during these many days, that the king  of Egypt dieth, and the sons of Israel sigh because of the  service, and cry, and their cry goeth up unto God, because of  the service;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> and God heareth their groaning, and God remembereth His  covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> and God seeth the sons of Israel, and God knoweth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Moses hath been feeding the flock of Jethro his  father-in-law, priest of Midian, and he leadeth the flock  behind the wilderness, and cometh in unto the mount of God, to  Horeb;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> and there appeareth unto him a messenger of Jehovah in a  flame of fire, out of the midst of the bush, and he seeth, and  lo, the bush is burning with fire, and the bush is not  consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And Moses saith, `Let me turn aside, I pray thee, and I see  this great appearance; wherefore is the bush not burned?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> and Jehovah seeth that he hath turned aside to see, and God  calleth unto him out of the midst of the bush, and saith,  `Moses, Moses;' and he saith, `Here [am] I.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And He saith, `Come not near hither: cast thy shoes from off  thy feet, for the place on which thou art standing is holy  ground.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> He saith also, `I [am] the God of thy father, God of  Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob;' and Moses hideth his  face, for he is afraid to look towards God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And Jehovah saith, `I have certainly seen the affliction of  My people who [are] in Egypt, and their cry I have heard,  because of its exactors, for I have known its pains;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> and I go down to deliver it out of the hand of the  Egyptians, and to cause it to go up out of the land, unto a  land good and broad, unto a land flowing with milk and honey  -- unto the place of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the  Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> `And now, lo, the cry of the sons of Israel hath come in  unto Me, and I have also seen the oppression with which the  Egyptians are oppressing them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and now, come, and I send thee unto Pharaoh, and bring thou  out My people, the sons of Israel, out of Egypt.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And Moses saith unto God, `Who [am] I, that I go unto  Pharaoh, and that I bring out the sons of Israel from Egypt?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> and He saith, `Because I am with thee, and this [is] to  thee the sign that I have sent thee: in thy bringing out the  people from Egypt -- ye do serve God on this mount.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And Moses saith unto God, `Lo, I am coming unto the sons of  Israel, and have said to them, The God of your fathers hath  sent me unto you, and they have said to me, What [is] His  name? what do I say unto them?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And God saith unto Moses, `I AM THAT WHICH I AM;' He saith  also, `Thus dost thou say to the sons of Israel, I AM hath sent  me unto you.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And God saith again unto Moses, `Thus dost thou say unto  the sons of Israel, Jehovah, God of your fathers, God of  Abraham, God of Isaac, and God of Jacob, hath sent me unto you;  this [is] My name -- to the age, and this My memorial, to  generation -- generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> `Go, and thou hast gathered the elders of Israel, and hast  said unto them: Jehovah, God of your fathers, hath appeareth  unto me, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, I have  certainly inspected you, and that which is done to you in  Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> and I say, I bring you up out of the affliction of Egypt,  unto the land of the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the  Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite,  unto a land flowing [with] milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> `And they have hearkened to thy voice, and thou hast  entered, thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt,  and ye have said unto him, Jehovah, God of the Hebrews, hath  met with us; and now, let us go, we pray thee, a journey of  three days into the wilderness, and we sacrifice to Jehovah our  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> `And I -- I have known that the king of Egypt doth not  permit you to go, unless by a strong hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> and I have put forth My hand, and have smitten Egypt with  all My wonders, which I do in its midst -- and afterwards he  doth send you away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> `And I have given the grace of this people in the eyes of  the Egyptians, and it hath come to pass, when ye go, ye go not  empty;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> and [every] woman hath asked from her neighbour, and from  her who is sojourning in her house, vessels of silver, and  vessels of gold, and garments, and ye have put [them] on your  sons and on your daughters, and have spoiled the Egyptians.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And Moses answereth and saith, `And, if they do not give  credence to me, nor hearken to my voice, and say, Jehovah hath  not appeared unto thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And Jehovah saith unto him, `What [is] this in thy hand?'  and he saith, `A rod;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and He saith, `Cast it to the earth;' and he casteth it to  the earth, and it becometh a serpent -- and Moses fleeth from  its presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Put forth thy hand, and lay  hold on the tail of it;' and he putteth forth his hand, and  layeth hold on it, and it becometh a rod in his hand --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> `-- so that they believe that Jehovah, God of their fathers,  hath appeared unto thee, God of Abraham, God of Isaac, and God  of Jacob.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And Jehovah saith to him again, `Put in, I pray thee, thy  hand into thy bosom;' and he putteth in his hand into his  bosom, and he bringeth it out, and lo, his hand [is] leprous as  snow;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> and He saith, `Put back thy hand unto thy bosom;' and he  putteth back his hand unto his bosom, and he bringeth it out  from his bosom, and lo, it hath turned back as his flesh --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> `-- and it hath come to pass, if they do not give credence  to thee, and hearken not to the voice of the first sign, that  they have given credence to the voice of the latter sign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> `And it hath come to pass, if they do not give credence even  to these two signs, nor hearken to thy voice, that thou hast  taken of the waters of the River, and hast poured on the dry  land, and the waters which thou takest from the River have  been, yea, they have become -- blood on the dry land.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And Moses saith unto Jehovah, `O, my Lord, I [am] not a man  of words, either yesterday, or before, or since Thy speaking  unto Thy servant, for I [am] slow of mouth, and slow of  tongue.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And Jehovah saith unto him, `Who appointed a mouth for man?  or who appointeth the dumb, or deaf, or open, or blind? is it  not I, Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> and now, go, and I -- I am with thy mouth, and have  directed thee that which thou speakest;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> and he saith, `O, my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand  Thou dost send.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Moses, and He  saith, `Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I have known that  he speaketh well, and also, lo, he is coming out to meet thee;  when he hath seen thee, then he hath rejoiced in his heart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> and thou hast spoken unto him, and hast set the words in  his mouth, and I -- I am with thy mouth, and with his mouth,  and have directed you that which ye do;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> and he, he hath spoken for thee unto the people, and it  hath come to pass, he -- he is to thee for a mouth, and thou --  thou art to him for God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> and this rod thou dost take in thy hand, with which thou  doest the signs.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And Moses goeth and turneth back unto Jethro his  father-in-law, and saith to him, `Let me go, I pray thee, and I  turn back unto my brethren who [are] in Egypt, and I see  whether they are yet alive.' And Jethro saith to Moses, `Go in  peace.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And Jehovah saith unto Moses in Midian, `Go, turn back to  Egypt, for all the men have died who seek thy life;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> and Moses taketh his wife, and his sons, and causeth them  to ride on the ass, and turneth back to the land of Egypt, and  Moses taketh the rod of God in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `In thy going to turn back to  Egypt, see -- all the wonders which I have put in thy hand --  that thou hast done them before Pharaoh, and I -- I strengthen  his heart, and he doth not send the people away;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> and thou hast said unto Pharaoh, Thus said Jehovah, My son,  My first-born [is] Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> and I say unto thee, Send away My son, and he doth serve  Me; and -- thou dost refuse to send him away -- lo, I am  slaying thy son, thy first-born.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> And it cometh to pass in the way, in a lodging place, that  Jehovah meeteth him, and seeketh to put him to death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> and Zipporah taketh a flint, and cutteth off the foreskin  of her son, and causeth [it] to touch his feet, and saith,  `Surely a bridegroom of blood [art] thou to me;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> and He desisteth from him: then she said, `A bridegroom of  blood,' in reference to the circumcision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> And Jehovah saith unto Aaron, `Go to meet Moses into the  wilderness;' and he goeth, and meeteth him in the mount of God,  and kisseth him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> and Moses declareth to Aaron all the words of Jehovah with  which He hath sent him, and all the signs with which He hath  charged him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> And Moses goeth -- Aaron also -- and they gather all the  elders of the sons of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> and Aaron speaketh all the words which Jehovah hath spoken  unto Moses, and doth the signs before the eyes of the people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> and the people believe when they hear that Jehovah hath  looked after the sons of Israel, and that He hath seen their  affliction; and they bow and do obeisance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And afterwards have Moses and Aaron entered, and they say  unto Pharaoh, `Thus said Jehovah, God of Israel, Send My people  away, and they keep a feast to Me in the wilderness;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> and Pharaoh saith, `Who [is] Jehovah, that I hearken to His  voice, to send Israel away? I have not known Jehovah, and  Israel also I do not send away.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And they say, `The God of the Hebrews hath met with us, let  us go, we pray thee, a journey of three days into the  wilderness, and we sacrifice to Jehovah our God, lest He meet  us with pestilence or with sword.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And the king of Egypt saith unto them, `Why, Moses and  Aaron, do ye free the people from its works? go to your  burdens.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Pharaoh also saith, `Lo, numerous now [is] the people of the  land, and ye have caused them to cease from their burdens!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And Pharaoh commandeth, on that day, the exactors among the  people and its authorities, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> `Ye do not add to give straw to the people for the making of  the bricks, as heretofore -- they go and have gathered straw  for themselves;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> and the proper quantity of the bricks which they are making  heretofore ye do put on them, ye do not diminish from it, for  they are remiss, therefore they are crying, saying, Let us go,  let us sacrifice to our God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> let the service be heavy on the men, and let them work at  it, and not be dazzled by lying words.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And the exactors of the people, and its authorities, go  out, and speak unto the people, saying, `Thus said Pharaoh, I  do not give you straw,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> ye -- go ye, take for yourselves straw where ye find [it],  for there is nothing of your service diminished.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And the people is scattered over all the land of Egypt, to  gather stubble for straw,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> and the exactors are making haste, saying, `Complete your  works, the matter of a day in its day, as when there is straw.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And the authorities of the sons of Israel, whom the  exactors of Pharaoh have placed over them, are beaten, saying,  `Wherefore have ye not completed your portion in making brick  as heretofore, both yesterday and to-day?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And the authorities of the sons of Israel come in and cry  unto Pharaoh, saying, `Why dost thou thus to thy servants?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Straw is not given to thy servants, and they are saying to  us, Make bricks, and lo, thy servants are smitten -- and thy  people hath sinned.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And he saith, `Remiss -- ye are remiss, therefore ye are  saying, Let us go, let us sacrifice to Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> and now, go, serve; and straw is not given to you, and the  measure of bricks ye do give.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And the authorities of the sons of Israel see them in  affliction, saying, `Ye do not diminish from your bricks; the  matter of a day in its day.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And they meet Moses and Aaron standing to meet them, in  their coming out from Pharaoh,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> and say unto them, `Jehovah look upon you, and judge,  because ye have caused our fragrance to stink in the eyes of  Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants -- to give a sword  into their hand to slay us.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> And Moses turneth back unto Jehovah, and saith, `Lord, why  hast Thou done evil to this people? why [is] this? -- Thou hast  sent me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> and since I have come unto Pharaoh, to speak in Thy name,  he hath done evil to this people, and Thou hast not at all  delivered Thy people.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And Jehovah saith unto Moses, `Now dost thou see that which  I do to Pharaoh, for with a strong hand he doth send them away,  yea, with a strong hand he doth cast them out of his land.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And God speaketh unto Moses, and saith unto him, `I [am]  Jehovah,</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> And it hath come to pass, at the going out of Moses unto  the tent, all the people rise, and have stood, each at the  opening of his tent, and have looked expectingly after Moses,  until his going into the tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And it hath come to pass, at the going in of Moses to the  tent, the pillar of the cloud cometh down, and hath stood at  the opening of the tent, and He hath spoken with Moses;</p>
