  <h3 align="center">Young's Literal Translation: Zechariah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, hath a  word of Jehovah been unto Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of  Iddo, the prophet, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> `Jehovah was wroth against your fathers -- wrath!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And thou hast said unto them, Thus said Jehovah of Hosts,  turn back unto Me, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, And I  turn back unto you, said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Ye shall not be as your fathers, To whom the former prophets  called, saying: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, Turn back I pray  you, From your evil ways and from your evil doings, And they  did not hearken, Nor attend to Me -- an affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Your fathers -- where [are] they? And the prophets -- to the  age do they live?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Only, My words, and My statutes, That I commanded My  servants the prophets, Have they not overtaken your fathers,  And they turn back and say: As Jehovah of Hosts designed to do  to us, According to our ways, and according to our doings, So  He hath done to us?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> On the twenty and fourth day of the eleventh month, (it [is]  the month of Sebat,) in the second year of Darius, hath a word  of Jehovah been unto Zechariah, son of Berechiah, son of Iddo,  the prophet, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> I have seen by night, and lo, one riding on a red horse, and  he is standing between the myrtles that [are] in the shade, and  behind him [are] horses, red, bay, and white.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And I say, `What [are] these, my lord?' And the messenger  who is speaking with me saith unto me, `I -- I do shew thee  what these [are].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And the one who is standing between the myrtles doth answer  and say, `These [are] they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk up  and down in the land.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And they answer the messenger of Jehovah who is standing  between the myrtles, and say, `We have walked up and down in  the land, and lo, all the land is sitting still, and at rest.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And the messenger of Jehovah answereth and saith, `Jehovah  of Hosts! till when dost Thou not pity Jerusalem, and the  cities of Judah, that Thou hast abhorred these seventy years?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And Jehovah answereth the messenger, who is speaking with  me, good words, comfortable words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And the messenger who is speaking with me, saith unto me,  `Call, saying: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: I have been zealous  for Jerusalem, and for Zion [with] great zeal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And [with] great wrath I am wroth against the nations who  are at ease, For I was a little wroth, and they assisted -- for  evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> Therefore, thus said Jehovah: I have turned to Jerusalem  with mercies, My house is built in it, An affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts, And a line is stretched over Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Again call, saying: Thus said Jehovah of Hosts, Again do my  cities overflow from good, And Jehovah hath again comforted  Zion, And He hath fixed again on Jerusalem.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, four horns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And I say unto the messenger who is speaking with me, `What  [are] these?' And he saith unto me, `These [are] the horns that  have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And Jehovah doth shew me four artizans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And I say, `What [are] these coming in to do?' And He  speaketh, saying: `These [are] the horns that have scattered  Judah, so that no one hath lifted up his head, and these come  in to trouble them, to cast down the horns of the nations who  are lifting up a horn against the land of Judah -- to scatter  it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And I lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, a man, and in his  hand a measuring line.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And I say, `Whither are thou going?' And he saith unto me,  `To measure Jerusalem, to see how much [is] its breadth, and  how much its length.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And lo, the messenger who is speaking with me is going out,  and another messenger is going out to meet him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> and he saith unto him, `Run, speak unto this young man,  saying: Unwalled villages inhabit doth Jerusalem, From the  abundance of man and beast in her midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And I -- I am to her -- an affirmation of Jehovah, A wall of  fire round about, And for honour I am in her midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Ho, ho, and flee from the land of the north, An affirmation of  Jehovah, For, as the four winds of the heavens, I have spread  you abroad, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Ho, Zion, be delivered who art dwelling [with] the daughter  of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> For thus said Jehovah of Hosts: After honour He hath sent me  unto the nations who are spoiling you, For he who is coming  against you, Is coming against the daughter of His eye.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> For lo, I am waving my hand against them, And they have been  a spoil to their servants. And ye have known that Jehovah of  Hosts hath sent me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Singe, and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, For lo, I am  coming, and have dwelt in thy midst, An affirmation of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And joined have been many nations unto Jehovah in that day,  And they have been to Me for a people, And I have dwelt in thy  midst, And thou hast known that Jehovah of Hosts hath sent me  unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Jehovah hath inherited Judah, His portion on the holy  ground, And He hath fixed again on Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Hush, all flesh, because of Jehovah, For He hath been  roused up from His holy habitation!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And he sheweth me Joshua the high priest standing before the  messenger of Jehovah, and the Adversary standing at his right  hand, to be an adversary to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And Jehovah saith unto the Adversary: `Jehovah doth push  against thee, O Adversary, Yea, push against thee doth Jehovah,  Who is fixing on Jerusalem, Is not this a brand delivered from  fire?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and is standing  before the messenger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And he answereth and speaketh unto those standing before  him, saying: `Turn aside the filthy garments from off him.' And  he saith unto him, `See, I have caused thine iniquity to pass  away from off thee, so as to clothe thee with costly apparel.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> He also said, `Let them set a pure diadem on his head. And  they set the pure diadem on his head, and clothe him with  garments. And the messenger of Jehovah is standing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> and the messenger of Jehovah doth protest to Joshua, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: If in My ways thou dost walk,  And if My charge thou dost keep, Then also thou dost judge My  house, And also thou dost keep My courts, And I have given to  thee conductors among these standing by.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Hear, I pray thee, Joshua, the high priest, Thou and thy  companions sitting before thee, (For men of type [are] they,)  For lo, I am bringing in My servant -- a Shoot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> For lo, the stone that I put before Joshua, On one stone  [are] seven eyes, Lo, I am graving its graving, An affirmation  of Jehovah of Hosts, And I have removed the iniquity of that  land in one day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts, Ye do  call, each unto his neighbour, Unto the place of the vine, And  unto the place of the fig-tree!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And the messenger who is speaking with me doth turn back,  and stir me up as one who is stirred up out of his sleep,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> and he saith unto me, `What art thou seeing?' And I say, `I  have looked, and lo, a candlestick of gold -- all of it, and  its bowl [is] on its top, and its seven lamps [are] upon it,  and twice seven pipes [are] to the lights that [are] on its  top,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and two olive-trees [are] by it, one on the right of the  bowl, and one on its left.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And I answer and speak unto the messenger who is speaking  with me, saying, `What [are] these, my lord?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And the messenger who is speaking with me answereth and  saith unto me, `Hast thou not known what these [are]?' And I  say, `No, my lord.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And he answereth and speaketh unto me, saying: `This [is] a  word of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying: Not by a force, nor by  power, But -- by My Spirit, said Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Who [art] thou, O great mountain Before Zerubbabel -- for a  plain! And he hath brought forth the top-stone, Cries of Grace,  grace -- [are] to it.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And there is a word of Jehovah to me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Hands of Zerubbabel did found this house, And his hands do  finish it, And thou hast known that Jehovah of Hosts Hath sent  me unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> For who trampled on the day of small things, They have  rejoiced, And seen the tin weight in the hand of Zerubbabel,  These seven [are] the eyes of Jehovah, They are going to and  fro in all the land.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And I answer and say unto him, `What [are] these two  olive-trees, on the right of the candlestick, and on its left?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And I answer a second time, and say unto him, `What [are]  the two branches of the olive trees that, by means of the two  golden pipes, are emptying out of themselves the oil?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he speaketh unto me, saying, `Hast thou not known what  these [are]?' And I say, `No, my lord.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And he saith, `These [are] the two sons of the oil, who are  standing by the Lord of the whole earth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And I turn back, and lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo, a  flying roll.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And he saith unto me, `What art thou seeing?' And I say, `I  am seeing a flying roll, its length twenty by the cubit, and  its breadth ten by the cubit.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And he saith unto me, `This [is] the execration that is  going forth over the face of all the land, for every one who is  stealing, on the one side, according to it, hath been declared  innocent, and every one who hath sworn, on the other side,  according to it, hath been declared innocent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> `I have brought it out -- an affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts  -- and it hath come in unto the house of the thief, and unto  the house of him who hath sworn in My name to a falsehood, and  it hath remained in the midst of his house, and hath consumed  it, both its wood and its stones.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And the messenger who is speaking with me goeth forth, and  saith unto me, `Lift up, I pray thee, thine eyes, and see what  [is] this that is coming forth?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And I say, `What [is] it?' And he saith, `This -- the ephah  that is coming forth.' And he saith, `This [is] their aspect in  all the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And lo, a cake of lead lifted up; and this [is] a woman  sitting in the midst of the ephah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And he saith, `This [is] the wicked woman.' And he casteth  her unto the midst of the ephah, and casteth the weight of lead  on its mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And I lift up mine eyes, and see, and lo, two women are  coming forth, and wind in their wings; and they have wings like  wings of the stork, and they lift up the ephah between the  earth and the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And I say unto the messenger who is speaking with me,  `Whither [are] they causing the ephah to go?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And he saith unto me, `To build to it a house in the land  of Shinar.' And it hath been prepared and hath been placed  there on its base.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And I turn back, and lift up mine eyes, and look, and lo,  four chariots are coming forth from between two of the  mountains, and the mountains [are] mountains of brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> In the first chariot [are] red horses, and in the second  chariot brown horses,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> and in the third chariot white horses, and in the fourth  chariot strong grisled horses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And I answer and say unto the messenger who is speaking with  me, `What [are] these, my lord?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And the messenger answereth and saith unto me, `These [are]  four spirits of the heavens coming forth from presenting  themselves before the Lord of the whole earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> The brown horses that [are] therein, are coming forth unto  the land of the north; and the white have come forth unto their  hinder part; and the grisled have come forth unto the land of  the south;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> and the strong ones have come forth, and they seek to go to  walk up and down in the earth;' and he saith, `Go, walk up and  down in the earth;' and they walk up and down in the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And he calleth me, and speaketh unto me, saying, `See, those  coming forth unto the land of the north have caused My Spirit  to rest in the land of the north.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And there is a word of Jehovah unto me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> to take of the captivity (who came from Babylon) from  Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah, `and thou hast come in  -- thou, in that day, yea, thou hast come into the house of  Josiah son of Zephaniah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> and thou hast taken silver and gold, and hast made a crown,  and hast placed on the head of Joshua son of Josedech, the high  priest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> and hast spoken unto him, saying: Thus spake Jehovah of  Hosts, saying: Lo, a man! A Shoot -- [is] his name, And from  his place he doth shoot up, And he hath built the temple of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> Yea, he doth build the temple of Jehovah, And he doth bear  away honour, And he hath sat and ruled on His throne, And hath  been a priest on His throne, And a counsel of peace is between  both.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And the crown is to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to Jedaiah,  and to Hen son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in the temple of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And the far-off come in, and they have built in the temple  of Jehovah, and ye have known that Jehovah of Hosts hath sent  me unto you, yea, it hath come to pass, if ye do certainly  hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And it cometh to pass, in the fourth year of Darius the king  hath a word of Jehovah been unto Zechariah, in the fourth of  the ninth month, in Chisleu.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And Beth-El sendeth Sherezer and Regem-Melech, and its men,  to appease the face of Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> speaking unto the priests who [are] at the house of Jehovah  of Hosts, and unto the prophets, saying, `Do I weep in the  fifth month -- being separated -- as I have done these so many  years?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And there is a word of Jehovah of Hosts unto me, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> `Speak unto all the people of the land, and unto the  priests, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> When ye fasted with mourning in the fifth and in the seventh  [months] -- even these seventy years -- did ye keep the fast  [to] Me -- Me? And when ye eat, and when ye drink, is it not ye  who are eating, and ye who are drinking?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> `Are not [these] the words that Jehovah proclaimed by the  hand of the former prophets, in Jerusalem's being inhabited,  and [in] safety, and its cities round about it, and the south  and the plain -- abiding?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And there is a word of Jehovah unto Zechariah, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> `Thus spake Jehovah of Hosts, saying: True judgment judge  ye, And kindness and mercy do one with another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And widow, and fatherless, Sojourner, and poor, ye do not  oppress, And the calamity of one another ye do not devise in  your heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> And they refuse to attend, And they give a refractory  shoulder, And their ears have made heavy against hearing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And their heart they have made adamant, Against hearing the  law, and the words, That Jehovah of Hosts sent by His Spirit,  By the hand of the former prophets, And their is great wrath  from Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And it cometh to pass, as He called, And they have not  hearkened, So do they call, and I do not hearken, Said Jehovah  of Hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And I toss them on all the nations, That they have not  known, The land hath been desolate behind them, Of any passing  by and turning back, And they set a desirable land for a  desolation!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And there is a word of Jehovah of Hosts, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: I have been zealous for Zion  with great zeal, With great heat I have been zealous for her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> Thus said Jehovah: I have turned back unto Zion, And I have  dwelt in the midst of Jerusalem, And Jerusalem hath been called  `The city of truth,' And the mountain of Jehovah of Hosts, `The  holy mountain.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Again dwell do old men and old  women, In broad places of Jerusalem, And each his staff in his  hand, Because of abundance of days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And broad places of the city are full of boys and girls,  Playing in its broad places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Surely it is wonderful in the  eyes of the remnant of this people in those days, Also in Mine  eyes it is wonderful, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Lo, I am saving My people from  the land of the rising, And from the land of the going in, of  the sun,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And I have brought them in, They have dwelt in the midst of  Jerusalem, And they have been to Me for a people, And I am to  them for God, In truth and in righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Let your hands be strong, Ye who  are hearing in these days these words from the mouth of the  prophets, That in the day the house of Jehovah of Hosts Hath  been founded, the temple [is] to be built.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> For, before those days there hath been no hiring of man,  Yea, a hiring of beasts there is none; And to him who is going  out, And to him who is coming in, There is no peace because of  the adversary, And I send all men -- each against his  neighbour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And now, not as [in] the former days [am] I to the remnant  of this people, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Because of the sowing of peace, The vine doth give her  fruit, And the earth doth give her increase, And the heavens do  give their dew, And I have caused the remnant of this people To  inherit all these.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And it hath come to pass, As ye have been a reviling among  nations, O house of Judah, and house of Israel, So I save you,  and ye have been a blessing, Do not fear, let your hands be  strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> For, thus said Jehovah of Hosts, As I did purpose to do  evil to you, When your fathers made Me wroth, Said Jehovah of  Hosts, and I did not repent,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> So I have turned back, I have purposed, in these days, To  do good with Jerusalem, And with the house of Judah -- fear  not!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> These [are] the things that ye do: Speak ye truth each with  his neighbour, Truth and peaceful judgment judge in your gates,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And each the evil of his neighbour ye do not devise in your  heart, And a false oath ye do not love, For all these [are]  things that I have hated, An affirmation of Jehovah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And there is a word of Jehovah of Hosts unto me, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> `Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: The fast of the fourth, and  the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the  fast of the tenth [months], are to the house of Judah for joy  and for rejoicing, and for pleasant appointed seasons, and the  truth and the peace they have loved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: Yet come do peoples, and  inhabitants of many cities,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> Yea, gone have inhabitants of one To another, saying: We go  diligently, To appease the face of Jehovah, To seek Jehovah of  Hosts -- I go, even I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> Yea, come in have many peoples, and mighty nations, To seek  Jehovah of Hosts in Jerusalem, And to appease the face of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> Thus said Jehovah of Hosts: In those days take hold do ten  men of all languages of the nations, Yea, they have taken hold  on the skirt of a man, a Jew, saying: We go with you, for we  heard God [is] with you!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> The burden of a word of Jehovah against the land of Hadrach,  and Demmeseh -- his place of rest: (When to Jehovah [is] the  eye of man, And of all the tribes of Israel.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And also Hamath doth border thereon, Tyre and Zidon, for --  very wise!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And Tyre doth build a bulwark to herself, And doth heap  silver as dust, And gold as mire of out-places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Lo, the Lord doth dispossess her, And He hath smitten in the  sea her force, And she with fire is consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> See doth Ashkelon and fear, Also Gaza, and she is  exceedingly pained, Also Ekron -- for her expectation dried up,  And perished hath a king from Gaza, And Ashkelon doth not  remain,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And dwelt hath a foreigner in Ashdod, And I have cut off the  excellency of the Philistines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And turned aside his blood from his mouth, His abominations  from between his teeth, And he hath remained, even he, to our  God, And he hath been as a leader in Judah, And Ekron as a  Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And I have pitched for My house a camp, Because of the  passer through, and of the returner, And pass not through  against them again doth an exactor, For, now, I have seen with  My eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> Rejoice exceedingly, O daughter of Zion, Shout, O daughter  of Jerusalem, Lo, thy King doth come to thee, Righteous -- and  saved is He, Afflicted -- and riding on an ass, And on a colt  -- a son of she-asses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And I have cut off the chariot from Ephraim, And the horse  from Jerusalem, Yea, cut off hath been the bow of battle, And  he hath spoken peace to nations, And his rule [is] from sea  unto sea, And from the river unto the ends of earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> Also thou -- by the blood of thy covenant, I have sent thy  prisoners out of the pit, There is no water in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> Turn back to a fenced place, Ye prisoners of the hope, Even  to-day a second announcer I restore to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> For I have trodden for Me Judah, A bow I have filled [with]  Ephraim, And I have stirred up thy sons, O Zion, Against thy  sons, O Javan, And I have set thee as the sword of a hero.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And Jehovah doth appear for them, And gone forth as  lightning hath His arrow, And the Lord Jehovah with a trumpet  bloweth, And He hath gone with whirlwinds of the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> Jehovah of Hosts doth cover them over, And they consumed,  and subdued sling-stones, Yea, they have drunk, They have made  a noise as wine, And they have been full as a bowl, As corners  of an altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And saved them hath Jehovah their God In that day, as a  flock of His people, For stones of a crown are displaying  themselves over His ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> For what His goodness! and what His beauty! Corn the young  men, And new wine the virgins -- make fruitful!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> They asked of Jehovah rain in a time of latter rain,  Jehovah is making lightnings, And rain [in] showers He doth  give to them. To each -- the herb in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> Because the teraphim did speak iniquity, And the diviners  have seen a falsehood, And dreams of the vanity they speak,  [With] vanity they give comfort, Therefore they have journeyed  as a flock, They are afflicted, for there is no shepherd.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> Against the shepherds did Mine anger burn, And against the  he-goats I lay a charge, For inspected hath Jehovah of Hosts  His flock, the house of Judah, And set them as His beauteous  horse in battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> From him [is] a corner-stone, From him a nail, from him a  battle-bow, From him goeth forth every exactor together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And they have been as heroes, Treading in mire of  out-places in battle, And they have fought, for Jehovah [is]  with them, And have put to shame riders of horses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And I have made mighty the house of Judah, And the house of  Joseph I do save, And I have caused them to dwell, for I have  loved them, And they have been as [if] I had not cast them off,  For I [am] Jehovah their God, And I answer them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And Ephraim hath been as a hero, And rejoiced hath their  heart as wine, And their sons see, and they have rejoiced,  Rejoice doth their heart in Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> I hist for them, and I gather them, For I have redeemed  them, And they have multiplied as they did multiply.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And I sow them among peoples, And in far-off places they  remember Me, And they have lived with their sons, And they have  turned back.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And I have brought them back from the land of Egypt, And  from Asshur I do gather them, And unto the land of Gilead and  Lebanon I do bring them in, And there is not found for them  [space].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And He hath passed over through the sea, And hath pressed  and smitten billows in the sea, And dried up have been all  depths of a flood, And brought down hath been the excellency of  Asshur, And the rod of Egypt doth turn aside.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And I have made them mighty in Jehovah, And in His name  they walk up and down, An affirmation of Jehovah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Open, O Lebanon, thy doors, And fire doth devour among thy  cedars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Howl, O fir, for fallen hath the cedar, For their  honourable ones were destroyed, Howl, ye oaks of Bashan, For  come down hath the fenced forest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> A voice of the howling of the shepherds! For destroyed was  their robe of honour, A voice of the roaring of young lions!  For destroyed was the excellency of Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> Thus said Jehovah my God: `Feed the flock of the slaughter,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> Whose buyers slay them, and are not guilty, And their  sellers say, Blessed [is] Jehovah, And I am rich, And their  shepherds have no pity on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> For I have pity no more on inhabitants of the land, An  affirmation of Jehovah, And lo, I am causing man to come forth,  Each into the hand of his neighbour, And into the hand of his  king, And they have beaten down the land, And I do not deliver  out of their hand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> And I feed the flock of slaughter, even you, ye afflicted  of the flock; and I take to me two staves, the one I have  called Pleasantness, and the other I have called Bands, and I  feed the flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And I cut off the three shepherds in one month, and my soul  is grieved with them, and also their soul hath abhorred me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And I say, `I do not feed you, the dying, let die; and the  cut off, let be cut off; and the remaining ones, let each eat  the flesh of its neighbour.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And I take My staff Pleasantness, and cut it asunder, to  make void My covenant that I had made with all the peoples:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> and it is broken in that day, and know well do the  afflicted of the flock who are observing me, that it [is] a  word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And I say unto them: `If good in your eyes, give my hire,  and if not, forbear;' and they weigh out my hire -- thirty  silverlings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And Jehovah saith unto me, `Cast it unto the potter;' the  goodly price that I have been prized at by them, and I take the  thirty silverlings, and cast them [to] the house of Jehovah,  unto the potter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> And I cut asunder my second staff, Bands, to break the  unity between Judah and Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And Jehovah saith unto me, `Again take to thee the  instrument of a foolish shepherd.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> For lo, I am raising up a shepherd in the land, The cut  off he doth not inspect, The shaken off he doth not seek, And  the broken he doth not heal, The standing he doth not sustain,  And the flesh of the fat he doth eat, And their hoofs he doth  break off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> Wo [to] the worthless shepherd, forsaking the flock, A  sword [is] on his arm, and on his right eye, His arm is utterly  dried up, And his right eye is very dim!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> The burden of a word of Jehovah on Israel. An affirmation  of Jehovah, Stretching out heaven, and founding earth, And  forming the spirit of man in his midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> Lo, I am making Jerusalem a cup of reeling To all the  peoples round about, And also against Judah it is, In the siege  against Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> And it hath come to pass, in that day, I make Jerusalem a  burdensome stone to all the peoples, All loading it are  completely pressed down, And gathered against it have been all  nations of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> In that day -- an affirmation of Jehovah, I do smite every  horse with astonishment, And its rider with madness, And on the  house of Judah I open My eyes, And every horse of the peoples I  smite with blindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And leaders of Judah have said in their heart, `Strength to  me [are] the inhabitants of Jerusalem, In Jehovah of Hosts  their God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> In that day I make the leaders of Judah As a hearth of fire  among trees, And as a torch of fire in a sheaf, And they have  consumed -- on the right and on the left -- all the peoples  round about, And Jerusalem hath inhabited again her place in  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And saved hath Jehovah the tents of Judah first, So that  become not great against Judah Doth the beauty of the house of  David, And the beauty of the inhabitant of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> In that day cover over doth Jehovah the inhabitant of  Jerusalem, And the stumbling among them hath been in that day  as David, And the house of David as God -- As a messenger of  Jehovah -- before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And it hath come to pass, in that day, I seek to destroy  all the nations Who are coming in against Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And I have poured on the house of David, And on the  inhabitant of Jerusalem, A spirit of grace and supplications,  And they have looked unto Me whom they pierced, And they have  mourned over it, Like a mourning over the only one, And they  have been in bitterness for it, Like a bitterness over the  first-born.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> In that day, great is the mourning of Jerusalem, As the  mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> And mourned hath the land -- every family apart, The  family of the house of David apart, And their women apart; The  family of the house of Nathan apart, And their women apart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> The family of the house of Levi apart, And their women  apart; The family of Shimei apart, And their women apart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> All the families that are left, Every family apart, and  their women apart!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> In that day there is a fountain opened To the house of  David And to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, For sin and for  impurity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And it hath come to pass, in that day, An affirmation of  Jehovah of Hosts, I cut off the names of the idols from the  land, And they are not remembered any more, And also the  prophets and the spirit of uncleanness I cause to pass away  from the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And it hath been, when one prophesieth again, That said  unto him have his father and his mother, his parents, `Thou  dost not live, For falsehood thou hast spoken in the name of  Jehovah,' And pierced him through have his father and his  mother, his parents, in his prophesying.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And it hath come to pass, in that day, Ashamed are the  prophets, each of his vision, in his prophesying, And they put  not on a hairy robe to deceive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And [one] hath said, `I am not a prophet, A man, a tiller  of ground I am, For ground [is] my possession from my youth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And [one] hath said unto him, `What [are] these wounds in  thy hands?' And he hath said, `Because I was smitten [at] home  by my lovers.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Sword, awake against My shepherd, And against a hero -- My  fellow, An affirmation of Jehovah of Hosts. Smite the shepherd,  and scattered is the flock, And I have put back My hand on the  little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And it hath come to pass, In all the land, an affirmation  of Jehovah, Two parts in it are cut off -- they expire, And the  third is left in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And I have brought the third into fire, And refined them  like a refining of silver, And have tried them like a trying of  gold, It doth call in My name, and I answer it, I have said,  `My people it [is],' And it saith, `Jehovah [is] my God!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> Lo, a day hath come to Jehovah, And divided hath been thy  spoil in thy midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> And I have gathered all the nations unto Jerusalem to  battle, And captured hath been the city, And spoiled have been  the houses, And the women are lain with, Gone forth hath half  the city in a removal, And the remnant of the people are not  cut off from the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> And gone forth hath Jehovah, And He hath fought against  those nations, As in the day of His fighting in a day of  conflict.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And stood have His feet, in that day, On the mount of  Olives, That [is] before Jerusalem eastward, And cleft hath  been the mount of Olives at its midst, To the east, and to the  west, a very great valley, And removed hath the half of the  mount towards the north. And its half towards the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And ye have fled [to] the valley of My mountains, For join  doth the valley of the mountains to Azal, And ye have fled as  ye fled before the shaking, In the days of Uzziah king of  Judah, And come in hath Jehovah my God, All holy ones [are]  with Thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And it hath come to pass, in that day, The precious light  is not, it is dense darkness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And there hath been one day, It is known to Jehovah, not  day nor night, And it hath been at evening-time -- there is  light.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And it hath come to pass, in that day, Go forth do living  waters from Jerusalem, Half of them unto the eastern sea, And  half of them unto the western sea, In summer and in winter it  is.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And Jehovah hath become king over all the land, In that day  there is one Jehovah, and His name one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> Changed is all the land as a plain, From Gebo to Rimmon,  south of Jerusalem, And she hath been high, and hath dwelt in  her place, Even from the gate of Benjamin To the place of the  first gate, unto the front gate, And from the tower of  Hananeel, Unto the wine-vats of the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And they have dwelt in her, And destruction is no more,  And Jerusalem hath dwelt confidently.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> And this is the plague with which Jehovah Doth plague all  the peoples who have warred against Jerusalem, He hath consumed  away its flesh, And it is standing on its feet, And its eyes  are consumed in their holes, And its tongue is consumed in  their mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And it hath come to pass, in that day, A great destruction  [from] Jehovah is among them, And they have seized each the  hand of his neighbour, And gone up hath his hand against the  hand of his neighbour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And also Judah is fought with in Jerusalem, And gathered  hath been the force of all the nations round about, Gold, and  silver, and apparel, in great abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And so is the plague of the horse, of the mule, Of the  camel, and of the ass, And of all the cattle that are in these  camps, As this plague.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> And it hath come to pass, Every one who hath been left of  all the nations, Who are coming in against Jerusalem, They have  also gone up from year to year, To bow themselves to the King,  Jehovah of Hosts, And to celebrate the feast of the booths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And it hath come to pass, That he who doth not go up of  the families of the land unto Jerusalem, To bow himself to the  King, Jehovah of Hosts, Even on them there is no shower.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And if the family of Egypt go not up, nor come in, Then  not on them is the plague With which Jehovah doth plague the  nations That go not up to celebrate the feast of booths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> This is the punishment of the sin of Egypt, And the  punishment of the sin of all the nations, That go not up to  celebrate the feast of booths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> In that day there is on bells of the horse, `Holy to  Jehovah,' And the pots in the house of Jehovah Have been as  bowls before the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> And every pot in Jerusalem, and in Judah, Have been holy  to Jehovah of Hosts, And all those sacrificing have come in,  And have taken of them, and boiled in them, And there is no  merchant any more in the house of Jehovah of Hosts in that day! </p>
