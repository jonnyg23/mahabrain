 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And it cometh to pass, after the death of Joshua, that the  sons of Israel ask at Jehovah, saying, `Who doth go up for us  unto the Canaanite, at the commencement, to fight against it?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> And Jehovah saith, `Judah doth go up; lo, I have given the  land into his hand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And Judah saith to Simeon his brother, `Go up with me into  my lot, and we fight against the Canaanite -- and I have gone,  even I, with thee into thy lot;' and Simeon goeth with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And Judah goeth up, and Jehovah giveth the Canaanite and the  Perizzite into their hand, and they smite them in Bezek -- ten  thousand men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and they find Adoni-Bezek in Bezek, and fight against him,  and smite the Canaanite and the Perizzite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And Adoni-Bezek fleeth, and they pursue after him, and seize  him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> and Adoni-Bezek saith, `Seventy kings -- their thumbs and  their great toes cut off -- have been gathering under my table;  as I have done so hath God repaid to me;' and they bring him in  to Jerusalem, and he dieth there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And the sons of Judah fight against Jerusalem, and capture  it, and smite it by the mouth of the sword, and the city they  have sent into fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> and afterwards have the sons of Judah gone down to fight  against the Canaanite, inhabiting the hill-country, and the  south, and the low country;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> and Judah goeth unto the Canaanite who is dwelling in  Hebron (and the name of Hebron formerly [is] Kirjath-Arba), and  they smite Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And he goeth thence unto the inhabitants of Debir (and the  name of Debir formerly [is] Kirjath-Sepher),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> and Caleb saith, `He who smiteth Kirjath-Sepher -- and hath  captured it -- then I have given to him Achsah my daughter for a  wife.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And Othniel son of Kenaz, younger brother of Caleb, doth  capture it, and he giveth to him Achsah his daughter for a  wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And it cometh to pass in her coming in, that she persuadeth  him to ask from her father the field, and she lighteth from off  the ass, and Caleb saith to her, `What -- to thee?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And she saith to him, `Give to me a blessing; when the  south land thou hast given me -- then thou hast given to me  springs of water; and Caleb giveth to her the upper springs and  the lower springs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And the sons of the Kenite, father-in-law of Moses, have  gone up out of the city of palms with the sons of Judah [to]  the wilderness of Judah, which [is] in the south of Arad, and  they go and dwell with the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And Judah goeth with Simeon his brother, and they smite the  Canaanite inhabiting Zephath, and devote it; and [one] calleth  the name of the city Hormah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And Judah captureth Gaza and its border, and Askelon and  its border, and Ekron and its border;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> and Jehovah is with Judah, and he occupieth the  hill-country, but not to dispossess the inhabitants of the  valley, for they have chariots of iron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And they give to Caleb Hebron, as Moses hath spoken, and he  dispossesseth thence the three sons of Anak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And the Jebusite, inhabiting Jerusalem, the sons of  Benjamin have not dispossessed; and the Jebusite dwelleth with  the sons of Benjamin, in Jerusalem, till this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And the house of Joseph go up -- even they -- to Beth-El, and  Jehovah [is] with them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> and the house of Joseph cause [men] to spy about Beth-El  (and the name of the city formerly is Luz),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> and the watchers see a man coming out from the city, and  say to him, `Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance of the city,  and we have done with thee kindness.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And he sheweth them the entrance of the city, and they  smite the city by the mouth of the sword, and the man and all  his family they have sent away;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> and the man goeth to the land of the Hittites, and buildeth  a city, and calleth its name Luz -- it [is] its name unto this  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> And Manasseh hath not occupied Beth-Shean and its towns,  and Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its  towns, and the inhabitants of Iblaim and its towns, and the  inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, and the Canaanite is  desirous to dwell in that land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> and it cometh to pass, when Israel hath been strong, that  he setteth the Canaanite to tribute, and hath not utterly  dispossessed it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> And Ephraim hath not dispossessed the Canaanite who is  dwelling in Gezer, and the Canaanite dwelleth in its midst, in  Gezer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> Zebulun hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Kitron,  and the inhabitants of Nahalol, and the Canaanite dwelleth in  its midst, and they become tributary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> Asher hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of Accho, and  the inhabitants of Zidon, and Ahlab, and Achzib, and Helbah,  and Aphik, and Rehob;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> and the Asherite dwelleth in the midst of the Canaanite,  the inhabitants of the land, for it hath not dispossessed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> Naphtali hath not dispossessed the inhabitants of  Beth-Shemesh, and the inhabitants of Beth-Anath, and he  dwelleth in the midst of the Canaanite, the inhabitants of the  land; and the inhabitants of Beth-Shemesh and of Beth-Anath  have become tributary to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:34">1:34</a> And the Amorites press the sons of Dan to the mountain, for  they have not suffered them to go down to the valley;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:35">1:35</a> and the Amorite is desirous to dwell in mount Heres, in  Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, and the hand of the house of Joseph  is heavy, and they become tributary;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:36">1:36</a> and the border of the Amorite [is] from the ascent of  Akrabbim, from the rock and upward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And a messenger of Jehovah goeth up from Gilgal unto Bochim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and saith, `I cause you to come up out of Egypt, and bring  you in unto the land which I have sworn to your fathers, and  say, I do not break My covenant with you to the age; and ye -- ye  make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land -- their  altars ye break down; and ye have not hearkened to My  voice -- what [is] this ye have done?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And I also have said, I do not cast them out from your  presence, and they have been to you for adversaries, and their  gods are to you for a snare.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And it cometh to pass, when the messenger of Jehovah  speaketh these words unto all the sons of Israel, that the  people lift up their voice and weep,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> and they call the name of that place Bochim, and sacrifice  there to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And Joshua sendeth the people away, and the sons of Israel  go, each to his inheritance, to possess the land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> and the people serve Jehovah all the days of Joshua, and all  the days of the elders who prolonged days after Joshua, who saw  all the great work of Jehovah which He did to Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Joshua son of Nun, servant of Jehovah, dieth, a son of a  hundred and ten years,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> and they bury him in the border of his inheritance, in  Timnath-Heres, in the hill-country of Ephraim, on the north of  mount Gaash;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> and also all that generation have been gathered unto their  fathers, and another generation riseth after them who have not  known Jehovah, and even the work which He hath done to Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of  Jehovah, and serve the Baalim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> and forsake Jehovah, God of their fathers, who bringeth  them out from the land of Egypt, and go after other gods (of  the gods of the peoples who [are] round about them), and bow  themselves to them, and provoke Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> yea, they forsake Jehovah, and do service to Baal and to  Ashtaroth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He  giveth them into the hand of spoilers, and they spoil them, and  He selleth them into the hand of their enemies round about, and  they have not been able any more to stand before their enemies;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> in every [place] where they have gone out, the hand of  Jehovah hath been against them for evil, as Jehovah hath  spoken, and as Jehovah hath sworn to them, and they are  distressed -- greatly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And Jehovah raiseth up judges, and they save them from the  hand of their spoilers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> and also unto their judges they have not hearkened, but  have gone a-whoring after other gods, and bow themselves to  them; they have turned aside [with] haste out of the way [in]  which their fathers walked to obey the commands of  Jehovah -- they have not done so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And when Jehovah raised up to them judges -- then was Jehovah  with the judge, and saved them out of the hand of their enemies  all the days of the judge; for it repenteth Jehovah, because of  their groaning from the presence of their oppressors, and of  those thrusting them away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And it hath come to pass, at the death of the judge -- they  turn back and have done corruptly above their fathers, to go  after other gods, to serve them, and to bow themselves to them;  they have not fallen from their doings, and from their stiff  way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And the anger of Jehovah doth burn against Israel, and He  saith, `Because that this nation have transgressed My covenant  which I commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened to My  voice --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> I also continue not to dispossess any from before them of  the nations which Joshua hath left when he dieth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> in order to try Israel by them, whether they are keeping  the way of Jehovah, to go in it, as their fathers kept [it] or  not.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And Jehovah leaveth these nations, so as not to dispossess  them hastily, and did not give them into the hand of Joshua.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And these [are] the nations which Jehovah left, to try  Israel by them, all who have not known all the wars of Canaan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> (only for the sake of the generations of the sons of  Israel's knowing, to teach them war, only those who formerly  have not known them) --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> five princes of the Philistines, and all the Canaanite, and  the Zidonian, and the Hivite inhabiting mount Lebanon, from  mount Baal-Hermon unto the entering in of Hamath;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> and they are to prove Israel by them, to know whether they  obey the commands of Jehovah that He commanded their fathers by  the hand of Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And the sons of Israel have dwelt in the midst of the  Canaanite, the Hittite, and the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and  the Hivite, and the Jebusite,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> and take their daughters to them for wives, and their  daughters have given to their sons, and they serve their gods;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> and the sons of Israel do the evil thing in the eyes of  Jehovah, and forget Jehovah their God, and serve the Baalim and  the shrines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And the anger of Jehovah burneth against Israel, and He  selleth them into the hand of Chushan-Rishathaim king of  Aram-Naharaim, and the sons of Israel serve Chushan-Rishathaim  eight years;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, and Jehovah raiseth  a saviour to the sons of Israel, and he saveth them -- Othniel  son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and the Spirit of Jehovah is upon him, and he judgeth  Israel, and goeth out to battle, and Jehovah giveth unto his  hand Chushan-Rishathaim king of Aram, and strong is his hand  against Chushan-Rishathaim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> and the land resteth forty years. And Othniel son of Kenaz  dieth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> and the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes  of Jehovah; and Jehovah strengtheneth Eglon king of Moab  against Israel, because that they have done the evil thing in  the eyes of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> and he gathereth unto him the Bene-Ammon and Amalek, and  goeth and smiteth Israel, and they possess the city of palms;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> and the sons of Israel serve Eglon king of Moab eighteen  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, and Jehovah  raiseth to them a saviour, Ehud son of Gera, a Benjamite (a  man -- shut of his right hand), and the sons of Israel send by  his hand a present to Eglon king of Moab;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> and Ehud maketh for himself a sword, and it hath two mouths  (a cubit [is] its length), and he girdeth it under his long  robe on his right thigh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> and he bringeth near the present to Eglon king of Moab, and  Eglon [is] a very fat man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And it cometh to pass, when he hath finished to bring near  the present, that he sendeth away the people bearing the  present,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> and he himself hath turned back from the graven images  which [are] at Gilgal, and saith, `A secret word I have unto  thee, O king;' and he saith, `Hush!' and go out from him do all  those standing by him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> And Ehud hath come unto him, and he is sitting in the upper  chamber of the wall which he hath for himself, and Ehud saith,  `A word of God I have unto thee;' and he riseth from off the  throne;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> and Ehud putteth forth his left hand, and taketh the sword  from off his right thigh, and striketh it into his belly;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> and the haft also goeth in after the blade, and the fat  shutteth on the blade, that he hath not drawn the sword out of  his belly, and it goeth out at the fundament.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And Ehud goeth out at the porch, and shutteth the doors of  the upper chamber upon him, and hath bolted [it];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> and he hath gone out, and his servants have come in, and  look, and lo, the doors of the upper chamber are bolted, and  they say, `He is only covering his feet in the inner chamber of  the wall.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> And they stay till confounded, and lo, he is not opening  the doors of the upper chamber, and they take the key, and  open, and lo, their lord is fallen to the earth -- dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And Ehud escaped during their tarrying, and hath passed by  the images, and is escaped to Seirath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> And it cometh to pass, in his coming in, that he bloweth  with a trumpet in the hill-country of Ephraim, and go down with  him do the sons of Israel from the hill-country, and he before  them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> and he saith unto them, `Pursue after me, for Jehovah hath  given your enemies, the Moabites, into your hand;' and they go  down after him, and capture the passages of the Jordan towards  Moab, and have not permitted a man to pass over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> And they smite Moab at that time, about ten thousand men,  all robust, and every one a man of valour, and not a man hath  escaped,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> and Moab is humbled in that day under the hand of Israel;  and the land resteth eighty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:31">3:31</a> And after him hath been Shamgar son of Anath, and he  smiteth the Philistines -- six hundred men -- with an ox-goad, and  he saveth -- he also -- Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes  of Jehovah when Ehud is dead,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> and Jehovah selleth them into the hand of Jabin king of  Canaan, who hath reigned in Hazor, and the head of his host  [is] Sisera, and he is dwelling in Harosheth of the Goyim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and the sons of Israel cry unto Jehovah, for he hath nine  hundred chariots of iron, and he hath oppressed the sons of  Israel mightily twenty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And Deborah, a woman inspired, wife of Lapidoth, she is  judging Israel at that time,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> and she is dwelling under the palm-tree of Deborah, between  Ramah and Beth-El, in the hill-country of Ephraim, and the sons  of Israel go up unto her for judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And she sendeth and calleth for Barak son of Abinoam, out of  Kedesh-Naphtali, and saith unto him, `Hath not Jehovah, God of  Israel, commanded? go, and thou hast drawn towards mount Tabor,  and hast taken with thee ten thousand men, out of the sons of  Naphtali, and out of the sons of Zebulun,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> and I have drawn unto thee, unto the brook Kishon, Sisera,  head of the host of Jabin, and his chariot, and his multitude,  and have given him into thy hand.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And Barak saith unto her, `If thou dost go with me, then I  have gone; and if thou dost not go with me, I do not go;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> and she saith, `I do certainly go with thee; only, surely  thy glory is not on the way which thou art going, for into the  hand of a woman doth Jehovah sell Sisera;' and Deborah riseth  and goeth with Barak to Kedesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And Barak calleth Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and he  goeth up -- at his feet [are] ten thousand men -- and Deborah goeth  up with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And Heber the Kenite hath been separated from the Kenite,  from the sons of Hobab father-in-law of Moses, and he  stretcheth out his tent unto the oak in Zaanaim, which [is] by  Kedesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And they declare to Sisera that Barak son of Abinoam hath  gone up to mount Tabor,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> and Sisera calleth all his chariots, nine hundred chariots  of iron, and all the people who [are] with him, from Harosheth  of the Goyim, unto the brook Kishon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And Deborah saith unto Barak, `Rise, for this [is] the day  in which Jehovah hath given Sisera into thy hand; hath not  Jehovah gone out before thee?' And Barak goeth down from mount  Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And Jehovah destroyeth Sisera, and all the chariots, and  all the camp, by the mouth of the sword, before Barak, and  Sisera cometh down from off the chariot, and fleeth on his  feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And Barak hath pursued after the chariots and after the  camp, unto Harosheth of the Goyim, and all the camp of Sisera  falleth by the mouth of the sword -- there hath not been left  even one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And Sisera hath fled on his feet unto the tent of Jael wife  of Heber the Kenite, for peace [is] between Jabin king of Hazor  and the house of Heber the Kenite;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> and Jael goeth out to meet Sisera, and saith unto him,  `Turn aside, my lord, turn aside unto me, fear not;' and he  turneth aside unto her, into the tent, and she covereth him  with a coverlet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And he saith unto her, `Give me to drink, I pray thee, a  little water, for I am thirsty;' and she openeth the bottle of  milk, and giveth him to drink, and covereth him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And he saith unto her, `Stand at the opening of the tent,  and it hath been, if any doth come in, and hath asked thee, and  said, Is there a man here? that thou hast said, There is not.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And Jael wife of Heber taketh the pin of the tent, and  taketh the hammer in her hand, and goeth unto him gently, and  striketh the pin into his temples, and it fasteneth in the  earth -- and he hath been fast asleep, and is weary -- and he  dieth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> And lo, Barak is pursuing Sisera, and Jael cometh out to  meet him, and saith to him, `Come, and I shew thee the man whom  thou art seeking;' and he cometh in unto her, and lo, Sisera is  fallen -- dead, and the pin in his temples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And God humbleth on that day Jabin king of Canaan before  the sons of Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> and the hand of the sons of Israel goeth, going on and  becoming hard on Jabin king of Canaan, till that they have cut  off Jabin king of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And Deborah singeth -- also Barak son of Abinoam -- on that day,  saying: --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> `For freeing freemen in Israel, For a people willingly  offering themselves Bless ye Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> Hear, ye kings; give ear, ye princes, I, to Jehovah, I -- I do  sing, I sing praise to Jehovah, God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> Jehovah, in Thy going forth out of Seir, In Thy stepping out  of the field of Edom, Earth trembled, also the heavens dropped,  Also thick clouds dropped water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Hills flowed from the face of Jehovah, This one -- Sinai --  From the face of Jehovah, God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> In the days of Shamgar son of Anath -- In the days of Jael --  The ways have ceased, And those going in the paths go [in]  crooked ways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Villages ceased in Israel -- they ceased, Till that I  arose -- Deborah, That I arose, a mother in Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> He chooseth new gods, Then war [is] at the gates! A shield  is not seen -- and a spear Among forty thousand in Israel.</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> And Gideon taketh ten men of his servants, and doth as  Jehovah hath spoken unto him, and it cometh to pass, because he  hath been afraid of the house of his father, and the men of the  city, to do [it] by day, that he doth [it] by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> And the men of the city rise early in the morning, and lo,  broken down hath been the altar of Baal, and the shrine which  is by it hath been cut down, and the second bullock hath been  offered on the altar which is built.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> And they say one to another, `Who hath done this thing?'  and they inquire and seek, and they say, `Gideon son of Joash  hath done this thing.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:33">6:33</a> And all Midian and Amalek and the sons of the east have  been gathered together, and pass over, and encamp in the valley  of Jezreel,</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:36">6:36</a> And Gideon saith unto God, `If Thou art Saviour of Israel  by my hand, as Thou hast spoken,</p>

 <p><a name="an_6:39">6:39</a> And Gideon saith unto God, `Let not Thine anger burn  against me, and I speak only this time; let me try, I pray  Thee, only this time with the fleece -- let there be, I pray  Thee, drought on the fleece alone, and on all the earth let  there be dew.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:40">6:40</a> And God doth so on that night, and there is drought on the  fleece alone, and on all the earth there hath been dew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And Jerubbaal (he [is] Gideon) riseth early, and all the  people who [are] with him, and they encamp by the well of  Harod, and the camp of Midian hath been on the south of him, on  the height of Moreh, in the valley.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `Too many [are] the people  who [are] with thee for My giving Midian into their hand, lest  Israel beautify itself against Me, saying, My hand hath given  salvation to me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> and now, call, I pray thee, in the ears of the people,  saying, Whoso [is] afraid and trembling, let him turn back and  go early from mount Gilead;' and there turn back of the people  twenty and two thousand, and ten thousand have been left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `Yet [are] the people too  many; bring them down unto the water, and I refine it for thee  there; and it hath been, he of whom I say unto thee, This doth  go with thee -- he doth go with thee; and any of whom I say  unto thee, This doth not go with thee -- he doth not go.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And he bringeth down the people unto the water, and Jehovah  saith unto Gideon, `Every one who lappeth with his tongue of  the water as the dog lappeth -- thou dost set him apart; also  every one who boweth on his knees to drink.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And the number of those lapping with their hand unto their  mouth is three hundred men, and all the rest of the people have  bowed down on their knees to drink water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And Jehovah saith unto Gideon, `By the three hundred men who  are lapping I save you, and have given Midian into thy hand,  and all the people go, each to his place.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And the people take the provision in their hand, and their  trumpets, and every man of Israel he hath sent away, each to  his tents; and on the three hundred men he hath kept hold, and  the camp of Midian hath been by him at the lower part of the  valley.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And it cometh to pass, on that night, that Jehovah saith  unto him, `Rise, go down into the camp, for I have given it  into thy hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> and if thou art afraid to go down -- go down, thou and Phurah  thy young man, unto the camp,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> and thou hast heard what they speak, and afterwards are thy  hands strengthened, and thou hast gone down against the camp.'  And he goeth down, he and Phurah his young man, unto the  extremity of the fifties who [are] in the camp;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> and Midian and Amalek, and all the sons of the east are  lying in the valley, as the locust for multitude, and of their  camels there is no number, as sand which [is] on the sea-shore  for multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And Gideon cometh in, and lo, a man is recounting to his  companion a dream, and saith, `Lo, a dream I have dreamed, and  lo, a cake of barley-bread is turning itself over into the camp  of Midian, and it cometh in unto the tent, and smiteth it, and  it falleth, and turneth it upwards, and the tent hath fallen.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And his companion answereth and saith, `This is nothing  save the sword of Gideon son of Joash, a man of Israel; God  hath given into his hand Midian and all the camp.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And he divideth the three hundred men [into] three  detachments, and putteth trumpets into the hand of all of them,  and empty pitchers, and lamps within the pitchers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> And he saith unto them, `Look at me, and thus do; and lo, I  am coming into the extremity of the camp -- and it hath been -- as  I do so ye do;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> and I have blown with a trumpet -- I and all who [are] with  me, and ye have blown with trumpets, even ye, round about all  the camp, and have said, For Jehovah and for Gideon.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And Gideon cometh -- and the hundred men who [are] with  him -- into the extremity of the camp, [at] the beginning of the  middle watch (it hath only just confirmed the watchmen), and  they blow with trumpets -- dashing in pieces also the pitchers  which [are] in their hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> and the three detachments blow with trumpets, and break the  pitchers, and keep hold with their left hand on the lamps, and  with their right hand on the trumpets to blow, and they cry,  `The sword of Jehovah and of Gideon.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And they stand each in his place, round about the camp, and  all the camp runneth, and they shout, and flee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> and the three hundred blow the trumpets, and Jehovah  setteth the sword of each against his companion, even through  all the camp; and the camp fleeth unto Beth-Shittah, at  Zererath, unto the border of Abel-Meholah, by Tabbath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And the men of Israel are called from Naphtali, and from  Asher, and from all Manasseh, and pursue after Midian.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And messengers hath sent Gideon into all the hill-country  of Ephraim, saying, `Come down to meet Midian, and capture  before them the waters unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan;' and  every man of Ephraim is called, and they capture the waters  unto Beth-Barah, and the Jordan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> and they capture two of the heads of Midian, Oreb, and  Zeeb, and slay Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they have  slain at the wine-vat of Zeeb, and they pursue unto Midian; and  the heads of Oreb and Zeeb they have brought in unto Gideon  beyond the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And the men of Ephraim say unto him, `What [is] this thing  thou hast done to us -- not to call for us when thou didst go to  fight with Midian?' and they strive with him severely;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> and he saith unto them, `What have I done now like you? are  not the gleanings of Ephraim better than the harvest of  Abi-Ezer?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> Into your hand hath God given the heads of Midian, Oreb and  Zeeb; and what have I been able to do like you?' Then their  temper desisted from off him in his speaking this thing.</p>

 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> and he saith to the men of Succoth, `Give, I pray you, cakes  of bread to the people who [are] at my feet, for they [are]  wearied, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna kings of  Midian.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And the heads of Succoth say, `Is the hand of Zebah and  Zalmunna now in thy hand, that we give to thy host bread?'</p>

 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And he cometh in unto the men of Succoth, and saith, `Lo  Zebah and Zalmunna, with whom ye reproached me, saying, Is the  hand of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thy hand that we give to thy  men who [are] wearied bread?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And he taketh the elders of the city, and the thorns of the  wilderness, and the threshing instruments, and teacheth by them  the men of Succoth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> and the tower of Penuel he hath broken down, and slayeth  the men of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And he saith unto Zebah and unto Zalmunna, `How -- the men  whom ye slew in Tabor?' and they say, `As thou -- so they, one -- as  the form of the king's sons.'</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:40">11:40</a> from time to time the daughters of Israel go to talk to  the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite, four days in a year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And the men of Ephraim are called together, and pass over  northward, and say to Jephthah, `Wherefore has thou passed over  to fight against the Bene-Ammon, and on us hast not called to  go with thee? thy house we burn over thee with fire.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> And Jephthah saith unto them, `A man of great strife I have  been (I and my people) with the Bene-Ammon, and I call you, and  ye have not saved me out of their hand,</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead, and fighteth  with Ephraim, and the men of Gilead smite Ephraim, because they  said, `Fugitives of Ephraim [are] ye Gileadites, in the midst  of Ephraim -- in the midst of Manasseh.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And Gilead captureth the passages of the Jordan to Ephraim,  and it hath been, when [any of] the fugitives of Ephraim say,  `Let me pass over,' and the men of Gilead say to him, `An  Ephramite thou?' and he saith, `No;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> that they say to him, `Say, I pray thee, Shibboleth;' and  he saith, `Sibboleth,' and is not prepared to speak right -- and  they seize him, and slaughter him at the passages of the  Jordan, and there fall at that time, of Ephraim, forty and two  chiefs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And Jephthah judged Israel six years, and Jephthah the  Gileadite dieth, and is buried in [one of] the cities of  Gilead.</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And Abdon son of Hillel, the Pirathonite, dieth, and is  buried in Pirathon, in the land of Ephraim, in the hill-country  of the Amalekite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And the sons of Israel add to do the evil thing in the eyes  of Jehovah, and Jehovah giveth them into the hand of the  Philistines forty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And there is a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the  Danite, and his name [is] Manoah, his wife [is] barren, and hath  not borne;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> and a messenger of Jehovah appeareth unto the woman, and  saith unto her, `Lo, I pray thee, thou [art] barren, and hast  not borne; when thou hast conceived, then thou hast borne a  son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And, now, take heed, I pray thee, and do not drink wine,  and strong drink, and do not eat any unclean thing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> for, lo, thou art conceiving and bearing a son, and a razor  doth not go up on his head, for a Nazarite to God is the youth  from the womb, and he doth begin to save Israel out of the hand  of the Philistines.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And the woman cometh and speaketh to her husband, saying,  `A man of God hath come unto me, and his appearance [is] as the  appearance of a messenger of God, very fearful, and I have not  asked him whence he [is], and his name he hath not declared to  me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> and he saith to me, Lo, thou art pregnant, and bearing a  son, and now do not drink wine and strong drink, and do not eat  any unclean thing, for a Nazarite to God is the youth from the  womb till the day of his death.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And Manoah maketh entreaty unto Jehovah, and saith, `O, my  Lord, the man of God whom Thou didst send, let him come in, I  pray thee, again unto us, and direct us what we do to the youth  who is born.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And God hearkeneth to the voice of Manoah, and the  messenger of God cometh again unto the woman, and she [is]  sitting in a field, and Manoah her husband is not with her,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> and the woman hasteth, and runneth, and declareth to her  husband, and saith unto him, `Lo, he hath appeared unto me -- the  man who came on [that] day unto me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> And Manoah riseth, and goeth after his wife, and cometh  unto the man, and saith to him, `Art thou the man who spake  unto the woman?' and he saith, `I [am].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> And Manoah saith, `Now let thy words come to pass; what is  the custom of the youth -- and his work?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah, `Of all  that I said unto the woman let her take heed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> of anything which cometh out from the wine-vine she doth  not eat, and wine and strong drink she doth not drink, and any  unclean thing she doth not eat; all that I have commanded her  she doth observe.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `Let us  detain thee, we pray thee, and prepare before thee a kid of the  goats.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And the messenger of Jehovah saith unto Manoah, `If thou  detain me -- I do not eat of thy bread; and if thou prepare a  burnt-offering -- to Jehovah thou dost offer it;' for Manoah hath  not known that He [is] a messenger of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And Manoah saith unto the messenger of Jehovah, `What [is]  thy name? when thy words come to pass, then we have honoured  thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> And the messenger of Jehovah saith to him, `Why [is]  this -- thou dost ask for My name? -- and it [is] Wonderful.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And Manoah taketh the kid of the goats, and the present,  and offereth on the rock to Jehovah, and He is doing  wonderfully, and Manoah and his wife are looking on,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> and it cometh to pass, in the going up of the flame from  off the altar toward the heavens, that the messenger of Jehovah  goeth up in the flame of the altar, and Manoah and his wife are  looking on, and they fall on their faces to the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> and the messenger of Jehovah hath not added again to  appear unto Manoah, and unto his wife, then hath Manoah known  that He [is] a messenger of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And Manoah saith unto his wife, `We certainly die, for we  have seen God.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> And his wife saith to him, `If Jehovah were desirous to  put us to death, He had not received from our hands  burnt-offering and present, nor shewed us all these things, nor  as [at this] time caused us to hear [anything] like this.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> And the woman beareth a son, and calleth his name Samson,  and the youth groweth, and Jehovah doth bless him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> and the Spirit of Jehovah beginneth to move him in the  camp of Dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And Samson goeth down to Timnath, and seeth a woman in  Timnath of the daughters of the Philistines,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> and cometh up and declareth to his father, and to his  mother, and saith, `A woman I have seen in Timnath, of the  daughters of the Philistines; and now, take her for me for a  wife.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> And his father saith to him -- also his mother, `Is there not  among the daughters of thy brethren, and among all my people, a  woman, that thou art going to take a woman from the  uncircumcised Philistines?' and Samson saith unto his father,  `Take her for me, for she is right in mine eyes.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And his father and his mother have not known that from  Jehovah it [is], that a meeting he is seeking of the  Philistines; and at that time the Philistines are ruling over  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And Samson goeth down -- also his father and his mother, to  Timnath, and they come unto the vineyards of Timnath, and lo, a  lion's whelp roareth at meeting him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and he  rendeth it as the rending of a kid, and there is nothing in his  hand, and he hath not declared to his father and to his mother  that which he hath done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And he goeth down and speaketh to the woman, and she is  right in the eyes of Samson;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> and he turneth back after [some] days to take her, and  turneth aside to see the carcase of the lion, and lo, a company  of bees [are] in the body of the lion -- and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And he taketh it down on to his hands, and goeth on, going  and eating; and he goeth unto his father, and unto his mother,  and giveth to them, and they eat, and he hath not declared to  them that from the body of the lion he took down the honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And his father goeth down unto the woman, and Samson  maketh there a banquet, for so the young men do;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> and it cometh to pass when they see him, that they take  thirty companions, and they are with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> And Samson saith to them, `Let me, I pray you, put forth  to you a riddle; if ye certainly declare it to me [in] the  seven days of the banquet, and have found [it] out, then I have  given to you thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of  garments;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> and if ye are not able to declare [it] to me, then ye have  given to me thirty linen shirts, and thirty changes of  garments.' And they say to him, `Put forth thy riddle, and we  hear it!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And he saith to them: `Out of the eater came forth meat,  And out of the strong came forth sweetness;' and they were not  able to declare the riddle [in] three days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And it cometh to pass, on the seventh day, that they say  to Samson's wife, `Entice thy husband, that he declare to us  the riddle, lest we burn thee and the house of thy father with  fire; to possess us have ye called for us? is it not?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> And Samson's wife weepeth for it, and saith, `Thou hast  only hated me, and hast not loved me; the riddle thou hast put  forth to the sons of my people -- and to me thou hast not  declared it;' and he saith to her, `Lo, to my father and to my  mother I have not declared [it] -- and to thee I declare [it]!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And she weepeth for it the seven days [in] which their  banquet hath been, and it cometh to pass on the seventh day  that he declareth [it] to her, for she hath distressed him; and  she declareth the riddle to the sons of her people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And the men of the city say to him on the seventh day,  before the sun goeth in: -- `What [is] sweeter than honey? And  what stronger than a lion?' And he saith to them: `Unless ye  had ploughed with my heifer, Ye had not found out my riddle.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> And the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him, and he  goeth down to Ashkelon, and smiteth of them thirty men, and  taketh their armour, and giveth the changes to those declaring  the riddle; and his anger burneth, and he goeth up to the house  of his father;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> and Samson's wife becometh his companion's, who [is] his  friend.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And it cometh to pass, after [some] days, in the days of  wheat-harvest, that Samson looketh after his wife, with a kid  of the goats, and saith, `I go in unto my wife, to the inner  chamber;' and her father hath not permitted him to go in,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> and her father saith, I certainly said, that thou didst  certainly hate her, and I give her to thy companion; is not her  sister -- the young one -- better than she? Let her be, I pray  thee, to thee, instead of her.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> And Samson saith of them, `I am more innocent this time  than the Philistines, though I am doing with them evil.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> And Samson goeth and catcheth three hundred foxes, and  taketh torches, and turneth tail unto tail, and putteth a torch  between the two tails, in the midst,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> and kindleth fire in the torches, and sendeth [them] out  into the standing corn of the Philistines, and burneth [it]  from heap even unto standing corn, even unto  vineyard -- olive-yard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> And the Philistines say, `Who hath done this?' And they  say, `Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because he hath taken  away his wife, and giveth her to his companion;' and the  Philistines go up, and burn her and her father with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And Samson saith to them, `Though ye do thus, nevertheless  I am avenged on you, and afterwards I cease!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And he smiteth them hip and thigh -- a great smiting, and  goeth down and dwelleth in the cleft of the rock Etam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> And the Philistines go up, and encamp in Judah, and are  spread out in Lehi,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> and the men of Judah say, `Why have ye come up against  us?' and they say, `To bind Samson we have come up, to do to  him as he hath done to us.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> And three thousand men of Judah go down unto the cleft of  the rock Etam, and say to Samson, `Hast thou now known that the  Philistines are rulers over us? and what [is] this thou hast  done to us?' And he saith to them, `As they did to me, so I did  to them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> And they say to him, `To bind thee we have come down -- to  give thee into the hand of the Philistines.' And Samson saith  to them, `Swear to me, lest ye fall upon me yourselves.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> And they speak to him, saying, No, but we certainly bind  thee, and have given thee into their hand, and we certainly do  not put thee to death;' and they bind him with two thick bands,  new ones, and bring him up from the rock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> He hath come unto Lehi -- and the Philistines have shouted  at meeting him -- and the Spirit of Jehovah prospereth over him,  and the thick bands which [are] on his arms are as flax which  they burn with fire, and his bands are wasted from off his  hands,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> and he findeth a fresh jaw-bone of an ass, and putteth  forth his hand and taketh it, and smiteth with it -- a thousand  men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> And Samson saith, `With a jaw-bone of the ass -- an ass  upon asses -- with a jaw-bone of the ass I have smitten a  thousand men.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> And it cometh to pass when he finisheth speaking, that he  casteth away the jaw-bone out of his hand, and calleth that  place Ramath-Lehi;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> and he thirsteth exceedingly, and calleth unto Jehovah,  and saith, `Thou -- Thou hast given by the hand of Thy servant  this great salvation; and now, I die with thirst, and have  fallen into the hand of the uncircumcised.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> And God cleaveth the hollow place which [is] in Lehi, and  waters come out of it, and he drinketh, and his spirit cometh  back, and he reviveth; therefore hath [one] called its name  `The fountain of him who is calling,' which [is] in Lehi unto  this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> And he judgeth Israel in the days of the Philistines  twenty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And Samson goeth to Gaza, and seeth there a woman, a  harlot, and goeth in unto her;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> [it is told] to the Gazathites, saying, `Samson hath come  in hither;' and they go round and lay wait for him all the  night at the gate of the city, and keep themselves silent all  the night, saying, `Till the light of the morning -- then we have  slain him.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> And Samson lieth down till the middle of the night, and  riseth in the middle of the night, and layeth hold on the doors  of the gate of the city, and on the two side posts, and  removeth them with the bar, and putteth on his shoulders, and  taketh them up unto the top of the hill, which [is] on the  front of Hebron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And it cometh to pass afterwards that he loveth a woman in  the valley of Sorek, and her name [is] Delilah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> and the princes of the Philistines come up unto her, and  say to her, `Entice him, and see wherein his great power [is],  and wherein we are able for him -- and we have bound him to  afflict him, and we -- we give to thee, each one, eleven hundred  silverlings.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> And Delilah saith unto Samson, `Declare, I pray thee, to  me, wherein thy great power [is], and wherewith thou art bound,  to afflict thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> And Samson saith unto her, `If they bind me with seven  green withs which have not been dried, then I have been weak,  and have been as one of the human race.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> And the princes of the Philistines bring up to her seven  green withs which have not been dried, and she bindeth him with  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And the ambush is abiding with her in an inner chamber, and  she saith unto him, `Philistines [are] upon thee, Samson;' and  he breaketh the withs as a thread of tow is broken in its  smelling fire, and his power hath not been known.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And Delilah saith unto Samson, `Lo, thou hast played upon  me, and speakest unto me lies; now, declare, I pray thee, to  me, wherewith thou art bound.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> And he saith unto her, `If they certainly bind me with  thick bands, new ones, by which work hath not been done, then I  have been weak, and have been as one of the human race.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> And Delilah taketh thick bands, new ones, and bindeth him  with them, and saith unto him, `Philistines [are] upon thee,  Samson;' and the ambush is abiding in an inner chamber, and he  breaketh them from off his arms as a thread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And Delilah saith unto Samson, `Hitherto thou hast played  upon me, and dost speak unto me lies; declare to me wherewith  thou art bound.' And he saith unto her, `If thou weavest the  seven locks of my head with the web.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> And she fixeth [it] with the pin, and saith unto him,  `Philistines [are] upon thee, Samson;' and he awaketh out of  his sleep, and journeyeth with the pin of the weaving machine,  and with the web.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> And she saith unto him, `How dost thou say, I have loved  thee, and thy heart is not with me? these three times thou hast  played upon me, and hast not declared to me wherein thy great  power [is].'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> And it cometh to pass, because she distressed him with her  words all the days, and doth urge him, and his soul is grieved  to death,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> that he declareth to her all his heart, and saith to her,  `A razor hath not gone up on my head, for a Nazarite to God I  [am] from the womb of my mother; if I have been shaven, then  hath my power turned aside from me, and I have been weak, and  have been as any of the human race.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And Delilah seeth that he hath declared to her all his  heart, and she sendeth and calleth for the princes of the  Philistines, saying, `Come up this time, for he hath declared  to me all his heart;' and the princes of the Philistines have  come up unto her, and bring up the money in their hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> and she maketh him sleep on her knees, and calleth for a  man, and shaveth the seven locks of his head, and beginneth to  afflict him, and his power turneth aside from off him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> and she saith, `Philistines [are] upon thee, Samson;' and  he awaketh out of his sleep, and saith, `I go out as time by  time, and shake myself;' and he hath not known that Jehovah  hath turned aside from off him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> And the Philistines seize him, and pick out his eyes, and  bring him down to Gaza, and bind him with two brazen fetters;  and he is grinding in the prison-house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> And the hair of his head beginneth to shoot up, when he  hath been shaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> and the princes of the Philistines have been gathered  together to sacrifice a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and  to rejoice; and they say, `Our god hath given into our hand  Samson our enemy.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> And the people see him, and praise their god, for they  said, `Our god hath given in our hand our enemy, and he who is  laying waste our land, and who multiplied our wounded.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> And it cometh to pass, when their heart [is] glad, that  they say, `Call for Samson, and he doth play before us;' and  they call for Samson out of the prison-house, and he playeth  before them, and they cause him to stand between the pillars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> And Samson saith unto the young man who is keeping hold on  his hand, `Let me alone, and let me feel the pillars on which  the house is established, and I lean upon them.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> And the house hath been full of men and of women, and  thither [are] all the princes of the Philistines, and on the  roof [are] about three thousand men and women, who are looking  on the playing of Samson.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> And Samson calleth unto Jehovah, and saith, `Lord Jehovah,  remember me, I pray Thee, and strengthen me, I pray Thee, only  this time, O God; and I am avenged -- vengeance at once --  because of my two eyes, on the Philistines.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> And Samson turneth aside [to] the two middle pillars, on  which the house is established, and on which it is supported,  [to] the one with his right hand, and one with his left;</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:32">20:32</a> And the sons of Benjamin say, `They are smitten before us  as at the beginning;' but the sons of Israel said, `Let us  flee, and draw them away out of the city, unto the highways.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:33">20:33</a> And all the men of Israel have risen from their place, and  arrange themselves at Baal-Tamar, and the ambush of Israel is  coming forth out of its place, out of the meadow of Gibeah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:34">20:34</a> And they come in over against Gibeah -- ten thousand chosen  men out of all Israel -- and the battle [is] grievous, and they  have not known that the evil is striking against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:35">20:35</a> And Jehovah smiteth Benjamin before Israel, and the sons  of Israel destroy in Benjamin, on that day, twenty and five  thousand, and a hundred men; all these [are] drawing sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:36">20:36</a> And the sons of Benjamin see that they have been  smitten -- and the men of Israel give place to Benjamin, for they  have trusted unto the ambush which they had set against Gibeah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:37">20:37</a> and the ambush have hasted, and push against Gibeah, and  the ambush draweth itself out, and smiteth the whole of the  city by the mouth of the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:38">20:38</a> And there was the appointed sign to the men of Israel with  the ambush -- their causing to go up a great volume of smoke from  the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:39">20:39</a> And the men of Israel turn in battle, and Benjamin hath  begun to smite the wounded among the men of Israel, about  thirty men, for they said, `Surely they are utterly smitten  before us, as [at] the first battle;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:40">20:40</a> and the volume hath begun to go up from the city -- a pillar  of smoke -- and Benjamin turneth behind, and lo, gone up hath the  perfection of the city toward the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:41">20:41</a> And the men of Israel have turned, and the men of Benjamin  are troubled, for they have seen that the evil hath stricken  against them --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:42">20:42</a> and they turn before the men of Israel unto the way of the  wilderness, and the battle hath followed them; and those who  [are] from the city are destroying them in their midst;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:43">20:43</a> they have compassed the Benjamites -- they have pursued them  -- with ease they have trodden them down till over-against Gibeah,  at the sun-rising.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:44">20:44</a> And there fall of Benjamin eighteen thousand men -- the  whole of these [are] men of valour;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:45">20:45</a> and they turn and flee toward the wilderness, unto the  rock of Rimmon; and they glean of them in the highways five  thousand men, and follow after them unto Gidom, and smite of  them two thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:46">20:46</a> And all those falling of Benjamin are twenty and five  thousand men drawing sword, on that day -- the whole of these  [are] men of valour;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:47">20:47</a> and there turn and flee into the wilderness, unto the rock  of Rimmon six hundred men, and they dwell in the rock Rimmon  four months.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:48">20:48</a> And the men of Israel have turned back unto the sons of  Benjamin, and smite them by the mouth of the sword out of the  city, -- men unto cattle, unto all that is found; also all the  cities which are found they have sent into fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And the men of Israel have sworn in Mizpeh, saying, `None  of us doth give his daughter to Benjamin for a wife.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And the people come in to Beth-El, and sit there till the  evening before God, and lift up their voice, and weep -- a  great weeping,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> and say, `Why, O Jehovah, God of Israel, hath this been in  Israel -- to be lacking to-day, from Israel, one tribe?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And it cometh to pass on the morrow, that the people rise  early, and build there an altar, and cause to ascend  burnt-offerings and peace-offerings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And the sons of Israel say, `Who [is] he that hath not come  up in the assembly out of all the tribes of Israel unto  Jehovah?' for the great oath hath been concerning him who hath  not come up unto Jehovah to Mizpeh, saying, `He is surely put  to death.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And the sons of Israel repent concerning Benjamin their  brother, and say, `There hath been to-day cut off one tribe  from Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> what do we do for them -- for those who are left -- for wives,  and we -- we have sworn by Jehovah not to give to them of our  daughters for wives?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And they say, `Who is [that] one out of the tribes of  Israel who hath not come up unto Jehovah to Mizpeh?' and lo,  none hath come in unto the camp from Jabesh-Gilead -- unto the  assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And the people numbered themselves, and lo, there is not  there a man of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And the company send there twelve thousand men of the sons  of valour, and command them, saying, `Go -- and ye have smitten  the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead by the mouth of the sword,  even the women and the infants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And this [is] the thing which ye do; every male, and every  woman knowing the lying of a male, ye devote.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> And they find out of the inhabitants of Jabesh-Gilead four  hundred young women, virgins, who have not known man by the  lying of a male, and they bring them in unto the camp at  Shiloh, which [is] in the land of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> And all the company send, and speak, unto the sons of  Benjamin who [are] in the rock Rimmon, and proclaim to them  peace;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> and Benjamin turneth back at that time, and they give to  them the women whom they have kept alive of the women of  Jabesh-Gilead, and they have not found for [all of] them so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And the people repented concerning Benjamin, for Jehovah  had made a breach among the tribes of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And the elders of the company say, `What do we do to the  remnant for wives -- for the women have been destroyed out of  Benjamin?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And they say, `A possession of an escaped party [is] to  Benjamin, and a tribe is not blotted out from Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> and we -- we are not able to give to them wives out of our  daughters, for the sons of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed  [is] he who is giving a wife to Benjamin.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And they say, `Lo, a festival of Jehovah [is] in Shiloh,  from time to time, which [is] on the north of Beth-El, at the  rising of the sun, by the highway which is going up from  Beth-El to Shechem, and on the south of Lebonah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> And they command the sons of Benjamin, saying, `Go -- and ye  have laid wait in the vineyards,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> and have seen, and lo, if the daughters of Shiloh come out  to dance in dances -- then ye have gone out from the vineyards,  and caught for you each his wife out of the daughters of  Shiloh, and gone to the land of Benjamin;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> and it hath been, when their fathers or their brethren  come in to plead unto us, that we have said unto them, Favour  us [by] them, for we have not taken [to] each his wife in  battle, for ye -- ye have not given to them at this time [that]  ye are guilty.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> And the sons of Benjamin do so, and take women according  to their number, out of the dancers whom they have taken  violently away; and they go, and turn back unto their  inheritance, and build the cities, and dwell in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> And the sons of Israel go up and down thence at that time,  each to his tribe, and to his family; and they go out thence  each to his inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> In those days there is no king in Israel; each doth that  which is right in his own eyes. </p>
