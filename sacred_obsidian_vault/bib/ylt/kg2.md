 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And Moab transgresseth against Israel after the death of  Ahab,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> and Ahaziah falleth through the lattice in his upper chamber  that [is] in Samaria, and is sick, and sendeth messengers, and  saith unto them, `Go ye, inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron if  I recover from this sickness.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And a messenger of Jehovah hath spoken unto Elijah the  Tishbite, `Rise, go up to meet the messengers of the king of  Samaria, and speak unto them, Is it because there is not a God  in Israel -- ye are going to inquire of Baal Zebub god of  Ekron?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> and therefore, thus said Jehovah, The bed whither thou hast  gone up, thou dost not come down from it, for thou dost  certainly die;' and Elijah goeth on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And the messengers turn back unto him, and he saith unto  them, `What [is] this -- ye have turned back!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And they say unto him, `A man hath come up to meet us, and  saith unto us, Go, turn back unto the king who sent you, and ye  have said unto him, Thus said Jehovah, Is it because there is  not a God in Israel -- thou art sending to inquire of  Baal-Zebub god of Ekron? therefore, the bed whither thou hast  gone up, thou dost not come down from it, for thou dost  certainly die.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And he saith unto them, `What [is] the fashion of the man  who hath come up to meet you, and speaketh unto you these  words?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And they say unto him, `A man -- hairy, and a girdle of skin  girt about his loins;' and he saith, `He [is] Elijah the  Tishbite.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And he sendeth unto him a head of fifty and his fifty, and  he goeth up unto him (and lo, he is sitting on the top of the  hill), and he speaketh unto him, `O man of God, the king hath  spoken, Come down.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And Elijah answereth and speaketh unto the head of the  fifty, `And if I [am] a man of God, fire doth come down from  the heavens, and consume thee and thy fifty;' and fire cometh  down from the heavens, and consumeth him and his fifty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And he turneth and sendeth unto him another head of fifty  and his fifty, and he answereth and speaketh unto him, `O man  of God, thus said the king, Haste, come down.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And Elijah answereth and speaketh unto them, `If I [am] a  man of God, fire doth come down from the heavens, and consume  thee and thy fifty;' and fire of God cometh down from the  heavens, and consumeth him and his fifty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And he turneth and sendeth a third head of fifty and his  fifty, and the third head of fifty goeth up, and cometh in, and  boweth on his knees over-against Elijah, and maketh  supplication unto him, and speaketh unto him, `O man of God,  let be precious, I pray thee, my soul and the soul of thy  servants -- these fifty -- in thine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Lo, come down hath fire from the heavens, and consumeth the  two heads of the former fifties and their fifties; and, now,  let my soul be precious in thine eyes.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And a messenger of Jehovah speaketh unto Elijah, `Go down  with him, be not afraid of him;' and he riseth and goeth down  with him unto the king,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and speaketh unto him, `Thus said Jehovah, Because that  thou hast sent messengers to inquire of Baal-Zebub god of Ekron  -- is it because there is not a God in Israel to inquire of His  word? therefore, the bed whither thou hast gone up -- thou dost  not come down from it, for thou dost certainly die.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And he dieth, according to the word of Jehovah that Elijah  spake, and Jehoram reigneth in his stead, in the second year of  Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, for he had no son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And the rest of the matters of Ahaziah that he did, are  they not written on the book of the Chronicles of the kings of  Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And it cometh to pass, at Jehovah's taking up Elijah in a  whirlwind to the heavens, that Elijah goeth, and Elisha, from  Gilgal,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> and Elijah saith unto Elisha, `Abide, I pray thee, here, for  Jehovah hath sent me unto Beth-El;' and Elisha saith, `Jehovah  liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they go down  to Beth-El.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And sons of the prophets who [are] in Beth-El come out unto  Elisha, and say unto him, `Hast thou known that to-day Jehovah  is taking thy lord from thy head?' and he saith, `I also have  known -- keep silent.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And Elijah saith to him, `Elisha, abide, I pray thee, here,  for Jehovah hath sent me to Jericho;' and he saith, `Jehovah  liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they come in  to Jericho.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And sons of the prophets who [are] in Jericho come nigh unto  Elisha, and say unto him, `Hast thou known that to-day Jehovah  is taking thy lord from thy head?' and he saith, `I also have  known -- keep silent.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And Elijah saith to him, `Abide, I pray thee, here, for  Jehovah hath sent me to the Jordan;' and he saith, `Jehovah  liveth, and thy soul liveth, if I leave thee;' and they go on  both of them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> -- and fifty men of the sons of the prophets have gone on,  and stand over-against afar off -- and both of them have stood  by the Jordan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Elijah taketh his robe, and wrappeth [it] together, and  smiteth the waters, and they are halved, hither and thither,  and they pass over both of them on dry land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And it cometh to pass, at their passing over, that Elijah  hath said unto Elisha, `Ask, what do I do for thee before I am  taken from thee?' and Elisha saith, `Then let there be, I pray  thee, a double portion of thy spirit unto me;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> and he saith, `Thou hast asked a hard thing; if thou dost  see me taken from thee, it is to thee so; and if not, it is  not.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And it cometh to pass, they are going, going on and  speaking, and lo, a chariot of fire, and horses of fire, and  they separate between them both, and Elijah goeth up in a  whirlwind, to the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Elisha is seeing, and he is crying, `My father, my  father, the chariot of Israel, and its horsemen;' and he hath  not seen him again; and he taketh hold on his garments, and  rendeth them into two pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And he taketh up the robe of Elijah, that fell from off  him, and turneth back and standeth on the edge of the Jordan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> and he taketh the robe of Elijah that fell from off him,  and smiteth the waters, and saith, `Where [is] Jehovah, God of  Elijah -- even He?' and he smiteth the waters, and they are  halved, hither and thither, and Elisha passeth over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And they see him -- the sons of the prophets who [are] in  Jericho -- over-against, and they say, `Rested hath the spirit  of Elijah on Elisha;' and they come to meet him, and bow  themselves to him to the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and say unto him, `Lo, we pray thee, there are with thy  servants fifty men, sons of valour: let them go, we pray thee,  and they seek thy lord, lest the Spirit of Jehovah hath taken  him up, and doth cast him on one of the hills, or into one of  the valleys;' and he saith, `Ye do not send.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And they press upon him, till he is ashamed, and he saith,  `Send ye;' and they send fifty men, and they seek three days,  and have not found him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> and they turn back unto him -- and he is abiding in Jericho  -- and he saith unto them, `Did I not say unto you, Do not go?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And the men of the city say unto Elisha, `Lo, we pray thee,  the site of the city [is] good, as my lord seeth, and the  waters [are] bad, and the earth sterile.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And he saith, `Bring to me a new dish, and place there  salt;' and they bring [it] unto him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> and he goeth out unto the source of the waters, and casteth  there salt, and saith, `Thus said Jehovah, I have given healing  to these waters; there is not thence any more death and  sterility.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And the waters are healed unto this day, according to the  word of Elisha, that he spake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And he goeth up thence to Beth-El, and he is going up in  the way, and little youths have come out from the city, and  scoff at him, and say to him, `Go up, bald-head! go up,  bald-head!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> And he looketh behind him, and seeth them, and declareth  them vile in the name of Jehovah, and two bears come out of the  forest, and rend of them forty and two lads.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> And he goeth thence unto the hill of Carmel, and thence he  hath turned back to Samaria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Jehoram son of Ahab hath reigned over Israel, in  Samaria, in the eighteenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah,  and he reigneth twelve years,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> and doth the evil thing in the eyes of Jehovah, only not  like his father, and like his mother, and he turneth aside the  standing-pillar of Baal that his father made;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> only to the sins of Jeroboam son of Nebat that he caused  Israel to sin he hath cleaved, he hath not turned aside from  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And Mesha king of Moab was a sheep-master, and he rendered  to the king of Israel a hundred thousand lambs, and a hundred  thousand rams, [with] wool,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> and it cometh to pass at the death of Ahab, that the king of  Moab transgresseth against the king of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And king Jehoram goeth out in that day from Samaria, and  inspecteth all Israel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> and goeth and sendeth unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,  saying, `The king of Moab hath transgressed against me; dost  thou go with me unto Moab for battle?' and he saith, `I go up,  as I, so thou; as my people, so thy people; as my horses, so  thy horses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And he saith, `Where [is] this -- the way we go up?' and he  saith, `The way of the wilderness of Edom.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And the king of Israel goeth, and the king of Judah, and the  king of Edom, and they turn round the way seven days, and there  hath been no water for the camp, and for the cattle that [are]  at their feet,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and the king of Israel saith, `Alas, for Jehovah hath  called for these three kings, to give them into the hand of  Moab.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And Jehoshaphat saith, `Is there not here a prophet of  Jehovah, and we seek Jehovah by him?' And one of the servants  of the king of Israel answereth and saith, `Here [is] Elisha  son of Shaphat, who poured water on the hands of Elijah.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And Jehoshaphat saith, `The word of Jehovah is with him;'  and go down unto him do the king of Israel, and Jehoshaphat,  and the king of Edom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And Elisha saith unto the king of Israel, `What -- to me  and to thee? go unto the prophets of thy father, and unto the  prophets of thy mother;' and the king of Israel saith to him,  `Nay, for Jehovah hath called for these three kings to give  them into the hand of Moab.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And Elisha saith, `Jehovah of Hosts liveth, before whom I  have stood; for unless the face of Jehoshaphat king of Judah I  am lifting up, I do not look unto thee, nor see thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> and now, bring to me a minstrel; and it hath been, at the  playing of the minstrel, that the hand of Jehovah is on him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> and he saith, `Thus said Jehovah, Make this valley ditches  -- ditches;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> for thus said Jehovah, Ye do not see wind, nor do ye see  rain, and that valley is full of water, and ye have drunk --  ye, and your cattle, and your beasts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> `And this hath been light in the eyes of Jehovah, and he  hath given Moab into your hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> and ye have smitten every fenced city, and every choice  city, and every good tree ye cause to fall, and all fountains  of waters ye stop, and every good portion ye mar with stones.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> And it cometh to pass in the morning, at the ascending of  the [morning]-present, that lo, waters are coming in from the  way of Edom, and the land is filled with the waters,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> and all Moab have heard that the kings have come up to  fight against them, and they are called together, from every  one girding on a girdle and upward, and they stand by the  border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And they rise early in the morning, and the sun hath shone  on the waters, and the Moabites see, from over-against, the  waters red as blood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> and say, `Blood this [is]; the kings have been surely  destroyed, and they smite each his neighbour; and now for  spoil, Moab!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> And they come in unto the camp of Israel, and the  Israelites rise, and smite the Moabites, and they flee from  their face; and they enter into Moab, so as to smite Moab,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> and the cities they break down, and [on] every good portion  they cast each his stone, and have filled it, and every  fountain of water they stop, and every good tree they cause to  fall -- till one had left its stones in Kir-Haraseth, and the  slingers go round and smite it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And the king of Moab seeth that the battle has been too  strong for him, and he taketh with him seven hundred men,  drawing sword, to cleave through unto the king of Edom, and  they have not been able,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> and he taketh his son, the first-born who reigneth in his  stead, and causeth him to ascend -- a burnt-offering on the  wall, and there is great wrath against Israel, and they journey  from off him, and turn back to the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And a certain woman of the wives of the sons of the prophets  hath cried unto Elisha, saying, `Thy servant, my husband, is  dead, and thou hast known that thy servant was fearing Jehovah,  and the lender hath come to take my two children to him for  servants.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And Elisha saith unto her, `What do I do for thee? declare  to me, what hast thou in the house?' and she saith, `Thy  maid-servant hath nothing in the house except a pot of oil.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And he saith, `Go, ask for thee vessels from without, from  all thy neighbours -- empty vessels -- let [them] not be few;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> and thou hast entered, and shut the door upon thee, and upon  thy sons, and hast poured out into all these vessels, and the  full ones thou dost remove.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And she goeth from him, and shutteth the door upon her, and  upon her sons; they are bringing nigh unto her, and she is  pouring out,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> and it cometh to pass, at the filling of the vessels, that  she saith unto her son, `Bring nigh unto me a vessel more,' and  he saith unto her, `There is not a vessel more;' and the oil  stayeth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And she cometh and declareth to the man of God, and he  saith, `Go, sell the oil, and repay thy loan; and thou [and]  thy sons do live of the rest.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And the day cometh that Elisha passeth over unto Shunem, and  there [is] a great woman, and she layeth hold on him to eat  bread, and it cometh to pass, at the time of his passing over,  he turneth aside thither to eat bread,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> and she saith unto her husband, `Lo, I pray thee, I have  known that a holy man of God he is, passing over by us  continually;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> let us make, I pray thee, a little upper chamber of the  wall, and we set for him there a bed, and a table, and a high  seat, and a candlestick; and it hath been, in his coming in  unto us, he doth turn aside thither.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And the day cometh, that he cometh in thither, and turneth  aside unto the upper chamber, and lieth there,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> and he saith unto Gehazi his young man, `Call for this  Shunammite;' and he calleth for her, and she standeth before  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he saith to him, `Say, I pray thee, unto her, Lo, thou  hast troubled thyself concerning us with all this trouble; what  -- to do for thee? is it to speak for thee unto the king, or  unto the head of the host?' and she saith, `In the midst of my  people I am dwelling.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And he saith, `And what -- to do for her?' and Gehazi  saith, `Verily she hath no son, and her husband [is] aged.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And he saith, `Call for her;' and he calleth for her, and  she standeth at the opening,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> and he saith, `At this season, according to the time of  life, thou art embracing a son;' and she saith, `Nay, my lord,  O man of God, do not lie unto thy maid-servant.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And the woman conceiveth and beareth a son, at this season,  according to the time of life, that Elisha spake of unto her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And the lad groweth, and the day cometh that he goeth out  unto his father, unto the reapers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> and he saith unto his father, `My head, my head;' and he  saith unto the young man, `Bear him unto his mother;'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> and he beareth him, and bringeth him in unto his mother,  and he sitteth on her knees till the noon, and dieth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And she goeth up, and layeth him on the bed of the man of  God, and shutteth [the door] upon him, and goeth out,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> and calleth unto her husband, and saith, `Send, I pray  thee, to me, one of the young men, and one of the asses, and I  run unto the man of God, and return.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And he saith, `Wherefore art thou going unto him to-day? --  neither new moon nor sabbath!' and she saith, `Peace [to  thee]!'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> And she saddleth the ass, and saith unto her young man,  `Lead, and go, do not restrain riding for me, except I have  said [so] to thee.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> And she goeth, and cometh in unto the man of God, unto the  hill of Carmel, and it cometh to pass, at the man of God's  seeing her from over-against, that he saith unto Gehazi his  young man, `Lo, this Shunammite;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> now, run, I pray thee, to meet her, and say to her, Is  there peace to thee? is there peace to thy husband? is there  peace to the lad?' and she saith, `Peace.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> And she cometh in unto the man of God, unto the hill, and  layeth hold on his feet, and Gehazi cometh nigh to thrust her  away, and the man of God saith, `Let her alone, for her soul  [is] bitter to her, and Jehovah hath hidden [it] from me, and  hath not declared [it] to me.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> And she saith, `Did I ask a son from my lord? did I not  say, Do not deceive me?'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> And he saith to Gehazi, `Gird up thy loins, and take my  staff in thy hand, and go; when thou dost meet a man, thou dost  not salute him; and when a man doth salute thee, thou dost not  answer him; and thou hast laid my staff on the face of the  youth.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> And the mother of the youth saith, `Jehovah liveth, and thy  soul liveth -- if I leave thee;' and he riseth and goeth after  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> And Gehazi hath passed on before them, and layeth the staff  on the face of the youth, and there is no voice, and there is  no attention, and he turneth back to meet him, and declareth to  him, saying, `The youth hath not awaked.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:32">4:32</a> And Elisha cometh in to the house, and lo, the youth is  dead, laid on his bed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:33">4:33</a> and he goeth in and shutteth the door upon them both, and  prayeth unto Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:34">4:34</a> And he goeth up, and lieth down on the lad, and putteth his  mouth on his mouth, and his eyes on his eyes, and his hands on  his hands, and stretcheth himself upon him, and the flesh of  the lad becometh warm;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:35">4:35</a> and he turneth back and walketh in the house, once hither  and once thither, and goeth up and stretcheth himself upon him,  and the youth sneezeth till seven times, and the youth openeth  his eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:36">4:36</a> And he calleth unto Gehazi, and saith, `Call unto this  Shunammite;' and he calleth her, and she cometh in unto him,  and he saith, `Lift up thy son.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:37">4:37</a> And she goeth in, and falleth at his feet, and boweth  herself to the earth, and lifteth up her son, and goeth out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:38">4:38</a> And Elisha hath turned back to Gilgal, and the famine [is]  in the land, and the sons of the prophets are sitting before  him, and he saith to his young man, `Set on the great pot, and  boil pottage for the sons of the prophets.'</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:39">4:39</a> And one goeth out unto the field to gather herbs, and  findeth a vine of the field, and gathereth of it gourds of the  field -- the fulness of his garment -- and cometh in and  splitteth [them] into the pot of pottage, for they knew [them]  not;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:40">4:40</a> and they pour out for the men to eat, and it cometh to pass  at their eating of the pottage, that they have cried out, and  say, `Death [is] in the pot, O man of God!' and they have not  been able to eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:41">4:41</a> And he saith, `Then bring ye meal;' and he casteth into the  pot, and saith, `Pour out for the people, and they eat;' and  there was no evil thing in the pot.</p>
