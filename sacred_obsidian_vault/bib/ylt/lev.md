 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And Jehovah calleth unto Moses, and speaketh unto him out of  the tent of meeting, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> `Speak unto the sons of Israel, and thou hast said unto  them, Any man of you when he doth bring near an offering to  Jehovah, out of the cattle -- out of the herd, or out of the  flock -- ye do bring near your offering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> `If his offering [is] a burnt-offering out of the herd -- a  male, a perfect one, he doth bring near, unto the opening of  the tent of meeting he doth bring it near, at his pleasure,  before Jehovah;</p>

 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and he hath slaughtered the son of the herd before Jehovah;  and sons of Aaron, the priests, have brought the blood near,  and sprinkled the blood on the altar round about, which [is] at  the opening of the tent of meeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> `And he hath stripped the burnt-offering, and hath cut it  into its pieces;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> and the sons of Aaron the priest have put fire on the altar,  and arranged wood on the fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> and sons of Aaron, the priests, have arranged the pieces,  with the head and the fat, on the wood, which [is] on the fire,  which [is] on the altar;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> and its inwards and its legs he doth wash with water; and  the priest hath made perfume with the whole on the altar, a  burnt-offering, a fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> `And if his offering [is] out of the flock -- out of the  sheep or out of the goats -- for a burnt-offering, a male, a  perfect one, he doth bring near,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> and he hath slaughtered it by the side of the altar  northward, before Jehovah; and sons of Aaron, the priests, have  sprinkled its blood on the altar round about;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> and he hath cut it into its pieces, and its head and its  fat, and the priest hath arranged them on the wood, which [is]  on the fire, which [is] on the altar;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> and the inwards and the legs he doth wash with water, and  the priest hath brought the whole near, and hath made perfume  on the altar; it [is] a burnt-offering, a fire-offering of  sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> `And if his offering [is] a burnt-offering out of the fowl  to Jehovah, than he hath brought near his offering out of the  turtle-doves or out of the young pigeons,</p>

 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and he hath turned aside its crop with its feathers, and  hath cast it near the altar, eastward, unto the place of ashes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> and he hath cleaved it with its wings (he doth not separate  [it]), and the priest hath made it a perfume on the altar, on  the wood, which [is] on the fire; it [is] a burnt-offering, a  fire-offering of sweet fragrance to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> `And when a person bringeth near an offering, a present to  Jehovah, of flour is his offering, and he hath poured on it  oil, and hath put on it frankincense;</p>
