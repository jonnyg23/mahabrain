  <h3 align="center">Douay-Rheims Bible: Deuteronomy</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> These are the words, which Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan, in the plain wilderness, over against the Red Sea, between Pharan and Thophel and Laban and Haseroth, where there is very much gold: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of Mount Seir to Cadesbarne. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> In the fortieth year, the eleventh month, the first day of the month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel all that the Lord had commanded him to say to them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> After that he had slain Sehon king of the Amorrhites, who dwelt in Hesebon: and Og king of Basan who abode in Astaroth, and in Edrai, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Beyond the Jordan in the land of Moab. And Moses began to expound the law, and to say: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb, saying: You have stayed long enough in this mountain: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Turn you, and come to the mountain of the Amorrhites, and to the other places that are next to it, the plains and the hills and the vales towards the south, and by the sea shore, the land of the Chanaanites, and of Libanus, as far as the great river Euphrates. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Behold, said he, I have delivered it to you: go in and possess it, concerning which the Lord swore to your fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, that he would give it to them, and to their seed after them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And I said to you at that time: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> I alone am not able to bear you: for the Lord your God hath multiplied you, and you are this day as the stars of heaven, for multitude. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> (The Lord God of your fathers add to this number many thousands, and bless you as he hath spoken.) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> I alone am not able to bear your business, and the charge of you and your differences. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Let me have from among you wise and understanding men, and such whose conversation is approved among your tribes, that I may appoint them your rulers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Then you answered me: The thing is good which thou meanest to do. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And I took out of your tribes men wise and honourable, and appointed them rulers, tribunes, and centurions, and officers over fifties, and over tens, who might teach you all things. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And I commanded them, saying: Hear them, and judge that which is just: whether he be one of your country, or a stranger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> There shall be no difference of persons, you shall hear the little as well as the great: neither shall you respect any man's person, because it is the judgment of God. And if any thing seem hard to you, refer it to me, and I will hear it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And I commanded you all things that you were to do. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And departing from Horeb, we passed through the terrible and vast wilderness, which you saw, by the way of the mountain of the Amorrhite, as the Lord our God had commanded us. And when we were come into Cadesbarne, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> I said to you: You are come to the mountain of the Amorrhite, which the Lord our God will give to us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> See the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee: go up and possess it, as the Lord our God hath spoken to thy fathers: fear not, nor be any way discouraged. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And you came all to me, and said: Let us send men who may view the land, and bring us word what way we shall go up, and to what cities we shall go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> And because the saying pleased me, I sent of you twelve men, one of every tribe: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Who, when they had set forward and had gone up to the mountains, came as far as the valley of the cluster: and having viewed the land, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> Taking of the fruits thereof, to shew its fertility, they brought them to us, and said: The land is good, which the Lord our God will give us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> And you would not go up, but being incredulous to the word of the Lord our God, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> You murmured in your tents, and said: The Lord hateth us, and therefore he hath brought us out of the land of Egypt, that he might deliver us into the hand of the Amorrhite, and destroy us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> Whither shall we go up? the messengers have terrified our hearts, saying: The multitude is very great, and taller than we: the cities are great, and walled up td the sky, we have seen the sons of the Enacims there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> And I said to you: Fear not, neither be ye afraid of them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> The Lord God, who is your leader, himself will fight for you, as he did in Egypt in the sight of all. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> And in the wilderness (as thou hast seen) the Lord thy God hath carried thee, as a man is wont to carry his little son, all the way that you have come, until you came to this place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:32">1:32</a> And yet for all this you did not believe the Lord your God, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:33">1:33</a> Who went before you in the way, and marked out the place, wherein you should pitch your tents, in the night shewing you the way by fire, and in the day by the pillar of a cloud. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:34">1:34</a> And when the Lord had heard the voice of your words, he was angry and swore, and said: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:35">1:35</a> Not one of the men of this wicked generation shall see the good land, which I promised with an oath to your fathers: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:36">1:36</a> Except Caleb the son of Jephone: for he shall see it, and to him I will give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because he hath followed the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:37">1:37</a> Neither is his indignation against the people to be wondered at, since the Lord was angry with me also on your account, and said: Neither shalt thou go in thither. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:38">1:38</a> But Josue the son of Nun, thy minister, he shall go in for thee: exhort and encourage him, and he shall divide the land by lot to Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:39">1:39</a> Your children, of whom you said that they should be led away captives, and your sons who know not this day the difference of good and evil, they shall go in: and to them I will give the land, and they shall possess it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:40">1:40</a> But return you and go into the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:41">1:41</a> And you answered me: We have sinned against the Lord: we will go up and fight, as the Lord our God hath commanded. And when you went ready armed unto the mountain, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:42">1:42</a> The Lord said to me: Say to them: Go not up, and fight not, for I am not with you: lest you fall before your enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:43">1:43</a> I spoke, and you hearkened not: but resisting the commandment of the Lord, and swelling with pride, you went up into the mountain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:44">1:44</a> And the Amorrhite that dwelt in the mountains coming out, and meeting you, chased you, as bees do: and made slaughter of you from Seir as far as Horma. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:45">1:45</a> And when you returned and wept before the Lord, he heard you not, neither would he yield to ;your voice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:46">1:46</a> So you abode in Cadesbarne a long time. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And departing from thence we came into the wilderness that leadeth to the Red Sea, as the Lord had spoken to me: and we compassed mount Seir a long time. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And the Lord said to me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> You have compassed this mountain long enough: go toward the north: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And command thou the people, saying: You shall pass by the borders of your brethren the children of Esau, who dwell in Seir, and they will be afraid of you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Take ye then good heed that you stir not against them. For I will not give you of their land so much as the step of one foot can tread upon, because I have given mount Seir to Esau, for a possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> You shall buy meats of them for money and shall eat: you shall draw waters for money, and shall drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> The Lord thy God hath blessed thee in every work of thy hands: the Lord thy God dwelling with thee, knoweth thy journey, how thou hast passed through this great wilderness, for forty years, and thou hast wanted nothing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And when we had passed by our brethren the children of Esau, that dwelt in Seir, by the way of the plain from Elath and from Asiongaber, we came to the way that leadeth to the desert of Moab. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And the Lord said to me: Fight not against the Moabites, neither go to battle against them: for I will not give thee any of their land, because I have given Ar to the children of Lot in possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> The Emims first were the inhabitants thereof, a people great, and strong, and so tall, that like the race of the Enacims, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> They were esteemed as giants, and were like the sons of the Enacims. But the Moabites call them Emims. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> The Horrhites also formerly dwelt in Seir: who being driven out and destroyed, the children of Esau dwelt there, as Israel did in the land of his possession, which the Lord gave him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Then rising up to pass the torrent Zared, we came to it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And the time that we journeyed from Cadesbarne till we passed over the torrent Zared, was thirty-eight years: until all the generation of the men that were fit for war was consumed out of the camp, as the Lord had sworn: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> For his hand was against them, that they should perish from the midst of the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And after all the fighting men were dead, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> The Lord spoke to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> Thou shalt pass this day the borders of Moab, the city named Ar: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And when thou comest nigh the frontiers of the children of Ammon, take heed thou fight not against them, nor once move to battle: for I will not give thee of the land of the children of Ammon, because I have given it to the children of Lot for a possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> It was accounted a land of giants: and giants formerly dwelt in it, whom the Ammonites call Zomzommims, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> A people great and many, and of tall stature, like the Enacims whom the Lord destroyed before their face: and he made them to dwell in their stead, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> As he had done in favour of the children of Esau, that dwell in Seir, destroying the Horrhites, and delivering their land to them, which they possess to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> The Hevites also, that dwelt in Haserim as far as Gaza, were expelled by the Cappadocians: who came out of Cappadocia, and destroyed them, and dwelt in their stead. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> Arise ye, and pass the torrent Arnon: Behold I have delivered into thy hand Sehon king of Hesebon the Amorrhite, and begin thou to possess his land and make war against him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> This day will I begin to send the dread and fear of thee upon the nations that dwell under the whole heaven: that when they hear thy name they may fear and tremble, and be in pain like women in travail. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> So I sent messengers from the wilderness of Cademoth to Sehon the king of Hesebon with peaceable words, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> We will pass through thy land, we will go along by the highway: we will not turn aside neither to the right hand nor to the left. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> Sell us meat for money, that we may eat: give us water for money and so we will drink. We only ask that thou wilt let us pass through, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> As the children of Esau have done, that dwell in Seir, and the Moabites, that abide in Ar: until we come to the Jordan, and pass to the land which the Lord our God will give us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> And Sehon the king of Hesebon would not let us pass: because the Lord thy God had hardened his spirit, and fixed his heart, that he might be delivered into thy hands, as now thou seest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> And the Lord said to me: Behold I have begun to deliver unto thee Sehon and his land, begin to possess it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> And Sehon came out to meet us with all his people to fight at Jasa. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> And the Lord our God delivered him to us: and we slew him with his sons and all his people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> And we took all his cities at that time, killing the inhabitants of them, men and women and children. We left nothing of them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> Except the cattle which came to the share of them that took them: and the spoils of the cities, which we took: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> From Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, a town that is situate in a valley, as far as Galaad. There was not a village or city, that escaped our hands: the Lord our God delivered all unto us: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> Except the land of the children of Ammon, to which we approached not: and all that border upon the torrent Jeboc, and the cities in the mountains, and all the places which the Lord our God forbade us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Then we turned and went by the way of Basan: and Og the king of Basan came out to meet us with his people to fight in Edrai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And the Lord said to me: Fear him not: because he is delivered into thy hand, with all his people and his land: and thou shalt do to him as thou hast done to Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in Hesebon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> So the Lord our God delivered into our hands, Og also the king of Basan, and all his people: and we utterly destroyed them, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Wasting all his cities at one time, there was not a town that escaped us: sixty cities, all the country of Argob the kingdom of Og in Basan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> All the cities were fenced with very high walls, and with gates and bars, be- sides innumerable towns that had no walls. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And we utterly destroyed them, as we had done to Sehon the king of Hesebon, destroying every city, men and women and children: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> But the cattle and the spoils of the cities we took for our prey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And we took at that time the land out of the hand of the two kings of the Amorrhites, that were beyond the Jordan: from the torrent Amen unto the mount Hermon, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Which the Sidonians call Sarion, and the Amorrhites Sanir: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> All the cities that are situate in the plain, and all the land of Galaad and Basan as far as Selcha and Edrai, cities of the kingdom of Og in Basan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> For only Og king of Basan remained of the race of the giants. His bed of iron is shewn, which is in Rabbath of the children of Ammon, being nine cubits long, and four broad after the measure of the cubit of a man's hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And we possessed the land at that time from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the torrent Amen, unto the half of mount Galaad: and I gave the cities thereof to Ruben and Gad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And I delivered the other part of Galaad, and all Basan the kingdom of Og to the half tribe of Manasses, all the country of Argob: and all Basan is called the Land of giants. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Jair the son of Manasses possessed all the country of d Argob unto the borders of Gessuri, and Machati. And he called Basan by his own name, Havoth Jair, that is to say, the towns of Jair, until this present day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> To Machir also I gave Galaad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And to the tribes of Ruben and Cad I gave of the land of Galaad as far as the torrent Amen, half the torrent, and the confines even unto the torrent Jeboc, which is the border of the children of Ammon: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And the plain of the wilderness, and the Jordan, and the borders of Cenereth unto the sea of the desert, which is the most salt sea, to the foot of mount Phasga eastward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And I commanded you at that time, saying: The Lord your God giveth you this land for an inheritance, go ye well appointed before your brethren the children of Israel, all the strong men of you, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Leaving your wives and children and cattle. For I know you have much cattle, and they must remain in the cities, which I have delivered to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> Until the Lord give rest to your brethren, as he hath given to you: and they also possess the land, which he will give them beyond the Jordan: then shall every man return to his possession, which I have given you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> I commanded Josue also at that time, saying: Thy eyes have seen what the Lord your God hath done to these two kings: so will he do to all the king- dome to which thou shalt pass. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> Fear them not: for the Lord your God will fight for you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And I besought the Lord at that time, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> Lord God, thou hast begun to shew unto thy servant thy greatness, and most mighty hand, for there is no other God either in heaven or earth, that is able to do thy works, or to be compared to thy strength. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> I will pass over therefore, and will see this excellent land beyond the Jordan, and this goodly mountain, and Libanus. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And the Lord was angry with me on your account and heard me not, but said to me: It is enough: speak no more to me of this matter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> Go up to the top of Phasga, and cast thy eyes round about to the west, and to the north, and to the south, and to the east, and behold it, for thou shalt not pass this Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> Command Josue, and encourage and strengthen him: for he shall go before this people, and shall divide unto them the land which thou shalt see. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> And we abode in the valley over against the temple of Phogor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And now, O Israel, hear the commandments and judgments which I teach thee: that doing them, thou mayst live, and entering in mayst possess the land which the Lord the God of your fathers will give you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> You shall not add to the word that I speak to you, neither shall you take away from it: keep the commandments of the Lord your God which I command you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> Your eyes have seen all that the Lord hath done against Beelphegor, how he hath destroyed all his worshippers from among you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> But you that adhere to the Lord your Cad, are all alive until this present day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> You know that I have taught you statutes and justices, as the Lord my God hath commanded me: so shall you do them in the land which you shall possess: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And you shall observe, and fulfil them in practice. For this is your wisdom, and understanding in the sight of nations, that hearing all these precepts, they may say: Behold a wise and understanding people, a great nation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Neither is there any other nation so great, that hath gods so nigh them, as our God is present to all our petitions. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> For what other nation is there so renowned that hath ceremonies, and just judgments, and all the law, which I will set forth this day before your eyes? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> Keep thyself therefore, and thy soul carefully. Forget not the words that thy eyes have seen, and let them not go out of thy heart all the days of thy life. Thou shalt teach them to thy sons and to thy grandsons, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> From the day in which thou didst stand before the Lord thy God in Horeb, when the Lord spoke to me, saying: Call together the people unto me, that they may hear my words, and may learn to fear me all the time that they live on the earth, and may teach their children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And you came to the foot of the mount, which burned even unto heaven: and there was darkness, and a cloud and obscurity in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And the Lord spoke to you from the midst of the fire. You heard the voice of his words, but you saw not any form at all. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he shewed you his covenant, which he commanded you to do, and the ten words that he wrote in two tables of stone. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And he commanded me at that time that I should teach you the ceremonies and judgments which you shall do in the land, that you shall possess. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> Keep therefore your souls carefully. You saw not any similitude in the day that the Lord God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> Lest perhaps being deceived you might make you a graven similitude, or image of male or female, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> The similitude of any beasts, that are upon the earth, or of birds, that fly under heaven, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> Or of creeping things, that move on the earth, or of fishes, that abide in the waters under the earth: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> Lest perhaps lifting up thy eyes to heaven, thou see the sun and the moon, and all the stars of heaven, and being deceived by error thou adore and serve them, which the Lord thy God created for the service of all the nations, that are under heaven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> But the Lord hath taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace of Egypt, to make you his people of inheritance, as it is this present day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And the Lord was angry with me for your words, and he swore that I should not pass over the Jordan, nor enter into the excellent land, which he will give you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> Behold I die in this land, I shall not pass over the Jordan: you shall pass, and possess the goodly land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> Beware lest thou ever forget the covenant of the Lord thy God, which he hath made with thee: and make to thyself a graven likeness of those things which the Lord hath forbid to be made: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> Because the Lord thy God is a consuming fire, a jealous God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> If you shall beget sons and grandsons, and abide in the land, and being deceived, make to yourselves any similitude, committing evil before the Lord your God, to provoke him to wrath: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> I call this day heaven and earth to witness, that you shall quickly perish out of the land, which, when you have passed over the Jordan, you shall possess. You shall not dwell therein long, but the Lord will destroy you, </p>

 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> And there you shah serve gods, that were framed with men's hands: wood and stone, that neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> And when thou shalt seek there the Lord thy God, thou shalt find him: yet so, if thou seek him with all thy heart, and all the affliction of thy soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> After all the things aforesaid shall and thee, in the latter time thou shalt return to the Lord thy God, and shalt hear his voice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> Because the Lord thy God is a merciful God: he will not leave thee, nor altogether destroy thee, nor forget the covenant, by which he swore to thy fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:32">4:32</a> Ask of the days of old, that have been before thy time from the day that God created man upon the earth, from one end of heaven to the other end thereof, if ever there was done the like thing, or it hath been known at any time, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:33">4:33</a> That a people should hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of fire, as thou hast heard, and lived: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:34">4:34</a> If God ever did so as to go, and take to himself a nation out of the midst of nations by temptations, signs, and wonders, by fight, and a strong hand, and stretched out arm, and horrible visions according to all the things that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt, before thy eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:35">4:35</a> That thou mightest know that the Lord he is God, and there is no other besides him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:36">4:36</a> From heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might teach thee. And upon earth he shewed thee his exceeding great fire, and thou didst hear his words out of the midst of the fire, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:37">4:37</a> Because he loved thy fathers, and chose their seed after them. And he brought thee out of Egypt, going before thee with his great power, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:38">4:38</a> To destroy at thy coming very great nations, and stronger than thou art, and to bring thee in, and give thee their land for a possession, as thou seest at this present day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:39">4:39</a> Know therefore this day, and think in thy heart that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and in the earth beneath, and there is no other. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:40">4:40</a> Keep his precepts and commandments, which I command thee: that it may be well with thee, and thy children after thee, and thou mayst remain a long time upon the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:41">4:41</a> Then Moses set aside three cities beyond the Jordan at the east side, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:42">4:42</a> That any one might flee to them who should kill his neighbour unwillingly, and was not his enemy a day or two before, and that he might escape to some one of these cities: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:43">4:43</a> Bosor in the wilderness, which is situate in the plains of the tribe of Ruben: and Ramoth in Galaad, which is in the tribe of Gad: and Golan in Basan, which is in the tribe of Manasses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:44">4:44</a> This is the law, that Moses set before the children of Israel, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:45">4:45</a> And these are the testimonies and ceremonies and judgments, which he spoke to the children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:46">4:46</a> Beyond the Jordan in the valley over against the temple of Phogor, in the land of Sehon king of the Amorrhites, that dwelt in Hesebon, whom Moses slew. And the children of Israel coming out of Egypt, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:47">4:47</a> Possessed his land, and the land of Og king of Basan, of the two kings of the Amorrhites, who were beyond the Jordan towards the rising of the sun: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:48">4:48</a> From Aroer, which is situate upon the bank of the torrent Amen, unto mount Sion, which is also called Hermon, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:49">4:49</a> All the plain beyond the Jordan at the east side, unto the see of the wilderness, and unto the foot of mount Phasga. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And Moses called all Israel, and said to them: Hear, O Israel, the ceremonies and judgments, which I speak in your ears this day: learn them, and fulfil them in work. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> The Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> He made not the covenant with our fathers, but with us, who are now present and living. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> He spoke to us face to face in the mount out of the midst of fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> I was the mediator and stood between the Lord and you at that time, to shew you his words, for you feared the fire, and went not up into the mountain, and he said: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> I am the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Thou shalt not have strange gods in my sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Thou shalt not make to thyself a graven thing, nor the likeness of any things, that are in heaven above, or that are in the earth beneath, or that abide in the waters under the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Thou shalt not adore them, and thou shalt not serve them. For I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon their children unto the third and fourth generation, to them that hate me, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And shewing mercy unto many thousands, to them that love me, and keep my commandments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain: for he shall not be unpunished that taketh his name upon a vain thing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> Observe the day of the sabbath, to sanctify it, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Six days shalt thou labour, and shalt do all thy works. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> The seventh is the day of the sabbath, that is, the rest of the Lord thy God.

 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Remember that thou also didst serve in Egypt, and the Lord thy God brought thee out from thence with a strong hand, and a stretched out arm. Therefore hath he commanded thee that thou shouldst observe the sabbath day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Honour thy father and mother, as the Lord thy God hath commanded thee, that thou mayst live a long time, and it may be well with thee in the land, which the Lord thy God will give thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Thou shalt not kill. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Neither shalt thou commit adultery. </p>

 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> These words the Lord spoke to all the multitude of you in the mountain, out of the midst of the fire and the cloud, and the darkness, with a loud voice, adding nothing more: and he wrote them in two tables of stone, which he delivered unto me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> But you, after you heard the voice out of the midst of the darkness, and saw the mountain burn, came to me, all the princes of the tribes and the elders, and you said: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> Behold the Lord our God hath shewn us his majesty and his greatness, we have heard his voice out of the midst of the fire, and have proved this day that God speaking with man, man hath lived. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> Why shall we die therefore, and why shall this exceeding great Are consume us: for if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any more, we shall die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> What is all flesh, that it should hear the voice of the living God, who speaketh out of the midst of the fire, as we have heard, and be able to live? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> Approach thou rather: and hear all things that the Lord our God shall say to thee, and thou shalt speak to us, and we will hear and will do them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> And when the Lord had heard this, he said to me: I have heard the voice of the words of this people, which they spoke to thee: they have spoken all things well. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> Who shall give them to have such a mind, to fear me, and to keep all my commandments at all times, that it may be well with them and with their children for ever? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> Go and say to them: Return into your tents. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> But stand thou here with me, and I will speak to thee all my commandments, and ceremonies and judgments: which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them in the land, which I will give them for a possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:32">5:32</a> Keep therefore and do the things which the Lord God hath commanded you: you shall not go aside neither to the right hand, nor to the left. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:33">5:33</a> But you shall walk in the way that the Lord your God hath commanded, that you may live, and it may be well with you, and your days may be long in the land of your possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> These are the precepts, and ceremonies, and judgments, which the Lord your God commanded that I should teach you, and that you should do them in the land into which you pass over to possess it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> That thou mayst fear the Lord thy God, and keep all his commandments and precepts, which I command thee, and thy sons, and thy grandsons, all the days of thy life, that thy days may be prolonged. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Hear, O Israel, and observe to do the things which the Lord hath commanded thee, that it may be well with thee, and thou mayst be greatly multiplied, as the Lord the God of thy fathers hath promised thee a land flowing with milk and honey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with thy whole heart, and with thy whole soul, and with thy whole strength. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And these words which I command thee this day, shall be in thy heart: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And thou shalt tell them to thy children, and thou shalt meditate upon them sitting in thy house, and walking on thy journey, sleeping and rising. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And thou shalt bind them as a sign on thy hand, and they shall be and shall move between thy eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And thou shalt write them in the entry, and on the doors of thy house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And when the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, for which he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: and shall have given thee great and goodly cities, which thou didst not build, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> Houses full of riches, which thou didst not set up, cisterns which thou didst not dig, vineyards and oliveyards, which thou didst not plant, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And thou shalt have eaten and be full: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> Take heed diligently lest thou forget the Lord, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and shalt serve him only, and thou shalt swear by his name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> You shall not go after the strange gods of all the nations, that are round about you: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> Because the Lord thy God is a jealous God in the midst of thee: lest at any time the wrath of the Lord thy God be kindled against thee, and take thee away from the face of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God, as thou temptedst him in the place of temptation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> Keep the precepts of the Lord thy God, and the testimonies and ceremonies which he hath commanded thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> And do that which is pleasing and good in the sight of the Lord, that it may be well with thee: and going in thou mayst possess the goodly land, concerning which the Lord swore to thy fathers, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> That he would destroy all thy enemies before thee, as he hath spoken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> And when thy son shall ask thee to morrow, saying: What mean these testimonies, and ceremonies and judgments, which the Lord our God hath commanded us? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> Thou shalt say to him: We were bondmen of Pharao in Egypt, and the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> And he wrought signs and wonders great and very grievous in Egypt against Pharao, and all his house, in our sight, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in and give us the land, concerning which he swore to our fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> And the Lord commanded that we should do all these ordinances, and should fear the Lord our God, that it might be well with us all the days of our life, as it is at this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> And he will be merciful to us, if we keep and do all his precepts before the Lord our God, as he hath commanded us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> When the Lord thy God shall have brought thee into the land, which thou art going in to possess, and shall have destroyed many nations before thee, the Hethite, and the Gergezite, and the Amorrhite, and the Chanaanite, and the Pherezite, and the Hevite, and the Jebusite, seven nations much more numerous than thou art, and stronger than thou: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And the Lord thy God shall have delivered them to thee, thou shalt utterly destroy them. Thou shalt make no league with them, nor shew mercy to them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> Neither shalt thou make marriages with them. Thou shalt not give thy daughter to his son, nor take his daughter for thy son: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> For she will turn away thy son from following me, that he may rather serve strange gods, and the wrath of the Lord will be kindled, and will quickly destroy thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> But thus rather shall you deal with them: Destroy their altars, and break their statues, and cut down their groves, and burn their graven things. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Because thou art a holy people to the Lord thy God. The Lord thy God hath chosen thee, to be his peculiar people of all peoples that are upon the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Not because you surpass all nations in number, is the Lord joined unto you, and hath chosen you, for you are the fewest of any people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> But because the Lord hath loved you, and hath kept his oath, which he swore to your fathers: and hath brought you out with a strong hand, and redeemed you from the house of bondage, out of the hand of Pharao the king of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And thou shalt know that the Lord thy God, he is a strong and faithful God, keeping his covenant and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his commandments, unto a thousand generations: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And repaying forthwith them that hate him, so as to destroy them, without further delay immediately rendering to them what they deserve. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> 11Keep therefore the precepts and ceremonies and judgments, which I command thee this day to do. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> If after thou hast heard these judgments, thou keep and do them, the Lord thy God will also keep his covenant to thee, and the mercy which he swore to thy fathers: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And he will love thee and multiply thee, and will bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy land, thy corn, and thy vintage, thy oil, and thy herds, and the flocks of thy sheep upon the land, for which he swore to thy fathers that he would give it thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Blessed shalt thou be among all people. No one shall be barren among you of either sex, neither of men nor cattle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> The Lord will take away from thee all sickness: and the grievous infirmities of Egypt, which thou knowest, he will not bring upon thee, but upon thy enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> Thou shalt consume all the people, which the Lord thy God will deliver to thee. Thy eye shall not spare them, neither shalt thou serve their gods, lest they be thy ruin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> If thou say in thy heart: These nations are more than I, how shall I be able to destroy them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> Fear not, but remember what the Lord thy God did to Pharao and to all the Egyptians, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> The exceeding great plagues, which thy eyes saw, and the signs and wonders, and the strong hand, and the stretched out arm, with which the Lord thy God brought thee out: so will he do to all the people, whom thou fearest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> Moreover the Lord thy God will send also hornets among them, until he destroy and consume all that have escaped thee, and could hide themselves. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> Thou shalt not fear them, because the Lord thy God is in the midst of thee, a God mighty and terrible: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> He will consume these nations in thy sight by little and little and by degrees. Thou wilt not be able to destroy them altogether: lest perhaps the beasts of the earth should increase upon thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> But the Lord thy God shall deliver them in thy sight: and shall slay them until they be utterly destroyed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And he shall deliver their kings into thy hands, and thou shalt destroy their names from under Heaven: no man shall be able to resist thee, until thou destroy them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> Their graven things thou shalt burn with fire: thou shalt not covet the silver and gold of which they are made, neither shalt thou take to thee any thing thereof, lest thou offend, because it is an abomination to the Lord thy God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> Neither shalt thou bring any thing of the idol into thy house, lest thou become an anathema, like it. Thou shalt detest it as dung, and shalt utterly abhor it as uncleanness and filth, because it is an anathema. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> All the commandments, that I command thee this day, take great care to observe: that you may live, and be multiplied, and going in may possess the land, for which the Lord swore to your fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And thou shalt remember all the way through which the Lord thy God hath brought thee for forty years through the desert, to afflict thee and to prove thee, and that the things that were in thy heart might be made known, whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> He afflicted thee with want, and gave thee manna for thy food, which neither thou nor thy fathers knew: to shew that m not in bread alone doth man live, but in every word that proceedeth from the mouth of God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> Thy raiment, with which thou wast covered, hath not decayed for age, and thy foot is not worn, lo this is the fortieth year, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> That thou mayst consider in thy heart, that as a man traineth up his son, so the Lord thy God hath trained thee up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> That thou shouldst keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and fear him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> For the Lord thy God will bring thee into a good land, of brooks and of waters, and of fountains: in the plains of which and the hills deep rivers break out: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> A land of wheat, and barley, and vineyards, wherein fig trees and pomegranates, and oliveyards grow: a land of oil and honey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> Where without any want thou shalt eat thy bread, and enjoy abundance of all things: where the stones are iron, and out of its hills are dug mines of brass: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> That when thou hast eaten, and art full, thou mayst bless the Lord thy God for the excellent land which he hath given thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> Take heed, and beware lest at any time thou forget the Lord thy God, and neglect his commandments and judgments and ceremonies, which I command thee this day: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Lest after thou hast eaten and art filled, hast built goodly houses, and dwelt in them, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And shalt have herds of oxen and flocks of sheep, and plenty of gold and of silver, and of all things, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> Thy heart be lifted up, and thou remember not the Lord thy God, who brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And was thy leader in the great and terrible wilderness, wherein there was the serpent burning with his breath, and the scorpion and the dipsas, and no waters at all: who brought forth streams out of the hardest rock, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And fed thee in the wilderness with manna which thy fathers knew not. And after he had afflicted and proved thee, at the last he had mercy on thee, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> Lest thou shouldst say in thy heart: My own might, and the strength of my own hand have achieved all these things for me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> But remember the Lord thy God, that he hath given thee strength, that he might fulfil his covenant, concerning which he swore to thy fathers, as this present day sheweth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> But if thou forget the Lord thy God, and follow strange gods, and serve and adore them: behold now I foretell thee that thou shalt utterly perish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> As the nations, which the Lord destroyed at thy entrance, so shall you also perish, if you be disobedient to the voice of the Lord your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Hear, O Israel: Thou shalt go over the Jordan this day; to possess nations very great, and stronger than thyself, cities great, and walled up to the sky, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> A People great and tall, the sons of the Enacims, whom thou hast seen, and heard of, against whom no man is able to stand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> Thou shalt know therefore this day that the Lord thy God himself will pass over before thee, a devouring and consuming fire, to destroy and extirpate and bring them to nothing before thy face quickly, as he hath spoken to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Say not in thy heart, when the Lord thy God shall have destroyed them in thy sight: For my justice hath the Lord brought me in to possess this land, whereas these nations are destroyed for their wickedness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> For it is not for thy justices, and the uprightness of thy heart that thou shalt go in to possess their lands: but because they have done wickedly, they are destroyed at thy coming in: and that the Lord might accomplish his word, which he promised by oath to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Know therefore that the Lord thy God giveth thee not this excellent land in possession for thy justices, for thou art a very stiffnecked people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Remember, and forget not how then provokedst the Lord thy God to wrath in the wilderness. From the day that thou camest out of Egypt unto this place, thou hast always strove against the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> For in Horeb also thou didst provoke him, and he was angry, and would have destroyed thee, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> When I went up into the mount to receive the tables of stone, the tables of the covenant which the Lord made with you: and I continued in the mount forty days and nights, neither eating bread, nor drinking water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And the Lord gave me two tables of stone written with the finger of God, and containing all the words that he spoke to you in the mount from the midst of the Are, when the people were assembled together. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And when forty days were passed, and as many nights, the Lord gave me the two tables of stone, the tables of the covenant, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And said to me: Arise, and go down from hence quickly: for thy people, which thou hast brought out of Egypt, have quickly forsaken the way that thou hast shewn them, and have made to themselves a molten idol. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And again the Lord said to me: I see that this people is stiffnecked: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> Let me alone that I may destroy them, and abolish their name from under heaven, and set thee over a nation, that is greater and stronger than this. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And when I came down from the burning mount, and held the two tables of the covenant with both hands, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And saw that you had sinned against the Lord your God, and had made to yourselves a molten calf, and had quickly forsaken his way, which he had shewn you: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> I cast the tables out of my hands, and broke them in your sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And I fell down before the Lord se before, forty days and nights neither eating bread, nor drinking water, for all your sins, which you had committed against the Lord, and had provoked him to wrath: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> For I feared his indignation and anger, wherewith being moved against you, he would have destroyed you. And the Lord heard me this time also. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And he was exceeding angry against Aaron also, and would have destroyed him, and I prayed in like manner for him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And your sin that you had committed, that is, the calf, I took, and burned it with fire, and breaking it into pieces, until it was as small as dust, I threw it into the torrent, which cometh down from the mountain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> At the burning also, and at the place of temptation, and at the graves of lust you provoked the Lord: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And when he sent you from Cadesbarne, saying: Go up, and possess the land that I have given you, and you slighted the commandment of the Lord your God, and did not believe him, neither would you hearken to his voice: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> But were always rebellious from the day that I began to know you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And I lay prostrate before the Lord forty days and nights, in which I humbly besought him, that he would not destroy you as he had threatened: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And praying, I said: 0 Lord God, destroy not thy people, and thy inheritance, which thou hast redeemed in thy greatness, whom thou hast brought out of Egypt with a strong hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> Remember thy servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: look not on the stubbornness of this people, nor on their wickedness and sin: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> Lest perhaps the inhabitants of the land, out of which thou hast brought us, say: The Lord could not bring them into the land that he promised them, and he hated them: therefore he brought them out, that he might kill them in the wilderness, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> Who are thy people and thy inheritance, whom thou hast brought out by thy great strength, and in thy stretched out arm. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> At that time the Lord said to me: Hew thee two tables of stone like the former, and come up to me into the mount: and thou shalt make an ark of mood, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> And I will write on the tables the words that were in them, which thou brokest before, and thou shalt put them in the ark. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And I made an ark of setim wood And when I had hewn two tables of stone like the former, I went up into the mount, having them in my hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> And he wrote in the tables, according as he had written before, the ten words, which the Lord spoke to you in the mount from the midst of the fire, when the people were assembled: and he gave them to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And returning from the mount, I came down, and put the tables into the ark, that I had made, and they are there till this present, as the Lord commanded me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And the children of Israel removed their camp from Beroth of the children of Jacan into Mosera, where Aaron died and was buried, and Eleazar his son succeeded him in the priestly office. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> From thence they came to Gadgad, from which place they departed, and camped in Jetebatha, in a land of waters and torrents. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> At that time he separated the tribe of Levi, to carry the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to stand before him in the ministry, and to bless in his name until this present day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> Wherefore Levi hath no part nor possession with his brethren: because the Lord himself is his possession, as the Lord thy God promised him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And I stood in the mount, as before, forty days and nights: and the Lord heard me this time also, and would not destroy thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And he said to me: Go, and walk before the people, that they may enter, and possess the land, which I swore to their fathers that I would give them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And now, Israel, what doth the Lord thy God require of thee, but that thou fear the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and love him, and serve the Lord thy God, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And keep the commandments of the Lord, and his ceremonies, which I command thee this day, that it may be well with thee? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> Behold heaven is the Lord's thy God, and the heaven of heaven, the earth and all things that are therein. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And yet the Lord hath been closely joined to thy fathers, and loved them and chose their seed after them, that is to say, you, out of all nations, as this day it is proved. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and stiffen your neck no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> Because the Lord your God he is the God of gods, and the Lord of lords, a great God and mighty and terrible, a who accepteth no person nor taketh bribes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> He doth judgment to the fatherless and the widow, loveth the stranger, and giveth him food and raiment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And do you therefore love strangers, because you also were strangers in the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> Thou shalt fear the Lord thy God, and serve him only: to him thou shalt adhere, and shalt swear by his name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> He is thy praise, and thy God, that hath done for thee these great and terrible things, which thy eyes have seen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> In seventy souls thy fathers went down into Egypt: and behold now the Lord thy God hath multiplied thee as the stars of heaven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Therefore love the Lord thy God and observe his precepts and ceremonies, his judgments and commandments at all times. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Know this day the things that your children know not, who saw not the chastisements of the Lord your God. his great doings and strong hand, and stretched out arm, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> The signs and works which he did in the midst of Egypt to king Pharao, and to all his land, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And to all the host of the Egyptians, and to their horses and chariots: how the waters of the Red Sea covered them, when they pursued you, and how the Lord destroyed them until this present day: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And what he hath done to you in the wilderness, till you came to this place: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And to Dathan and Abiron the sons of Eliab, who was the son of Ruben: whom the earth, opening her mouth swallowed up with their households and tents, and all their substance, which they had in the midst of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> Your eyes have seen all the greet works of the Lord, that he hath done, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> That you may keep all his commandments, which I command you this day, and may go in, and possess the land, to which you are entering, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And may live in it a long time: which the Lord promised by oath to your fathers, and to their seed, a land which floweth with milk and honey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> For the land, which thou goest to possess, is not like the land of Egypt, from whence thou camest out, where, when the seed is sown, waters are brought in to water it after the manner of gardens. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> But it is a land of hills and plains, expecting rain from heaven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And the Lord thy God doth always visit it, and his eyes are on it from the beginning of the year unto the end thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> If then you obey my commandments, which I command you this day, that you love the Lord your God, and serve him with all your heart, and with all your soul: </p>

 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And your hay out of the fields to feed your cattle, and that you may eat and be filled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> Beware lest perhaps your heart be deceived, and you depart from the Lord, and serve strange gods, and adore them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> And the Lord being angry shut up heaven, that the rain come not down, nor the earth yield her fruit, and you perish quickly from the excellent land, which the Lord will give you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> Lay up these my words in your hearts and minds, and hang them for a sign on your hands, and place them between your eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> Teach your children that they meditate on them, when thou sittest in thy house, and when thou walkest on the way, end when thou liest down and risest up. </p>

 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> And you came to this place: and Sehon king of Hesebon, and Og king of Basan, came out against us to fight. And we slew them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> And took their land, and delivered it for a possession to h Ruben and Gad, and the half tribe of Manasses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and fulfil them: that you may understand all that you do. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> You all stand this day before the Lord your God, your princes, and tribes, and ancients, and doctors, all the people of Israel, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:11">29:11</a> 11Your children and your wives, and the stranger that abideth with thee in the camp, besides the hewers of wood, and them that bring water: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> That thou mayst pass in the covenant of the Lord thy God, and in the oath which this day the Lord thy God maketh with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> That he may raise thee up a people to himself, and he may be thy God as he hath spoken to thee, and as he swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> Neither with you only do I make this covenant, and confirm these oaths, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> But with all that are present and that are absent. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> For you know how we dwelt in the land of Egypt, and how we have passed through the midst of nations, and passing through them, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> You have seen their abominations and filth, that is to say, their idols, wood and stone, silver and gold, which they worshipped. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> Lest perhaps there should be among you a man or a woman, a family or a tribe, whose heart is turned away this day from the Lord our God, to go and serve the gods of those nations: and there should be among you a root bringing forth gall and bitterness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> And when he shall hear the words of this oath, he should bless himself in his heart saying: I shall have peace, and will walk on in the naughtiness of my heart: and the drunken may consume the thirsty, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> And the Lord should not forgive him: but his wrath and jealousy against that man should be exceedingly enkindled at that time, and all the curses that are written in this volume should light upon him: and the Lord should blot out his name from under heaven, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> And utterly destroy him out of all the tribes of Israel, according to the curses that are contained in the book of this law and covenant: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> And the following generation shall say, and the children that shall be born hereafter, and the strangers that shall come from afar, seeing the plagues of that land and the evils wherewith the Lord hath afflicted it, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> Burning it with brimstone, and the heat of salt, so that it cannot be sown any more, nor any green thing grow therein, after the example of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrha, Adama and Seboim, which the Lord destroyed in his wrath and indignation: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> And all the nations shall say: Why hath the Lord done thus to this land? what meaneth this exceeding great heat of his wrath? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> And they shall answer: Because they forsook the covenant of the Lord, which he made with their fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> And they have served strange gods, and adored them, whom they knew not, and for whom they had not been assigned: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> Therefore the wrath of the Lord was kindled against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that are written in this volume : </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:28">29:28</a> And he hath cast them out of their land, in anger and in wrath, and in very great indignation, and hath thrown them into a strange land, as it is seen this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:29">29:29</a> Secret things to the Lord our God: things that are manifest, to us and to our children for ever, that we may do all the words of this law. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> Now when all these things shall be come upon thee, the blessing or the curse, which I have set forth before thee, and thou shalt be touched with repentance of thy heart among all the nations, into which the Lord thy God shall have scattered thee, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> And shalt return to him, and obey his commandments, as I command thee this day, thou and thy children, with all thy heart, and with all thy soul: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> The Lord thy God will bring back again thy captivity, and will have mercy on thee, and gather thee again out of all the nations, into which he scattered thee before. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> If thou be driven as far as the poles of heaven, the Lord thy God will fetch thee back from thence, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> And will take thee to himself, and bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it: and blessing thee, he will make thee more numerous than were thy fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> The Lord thy God will circumcise thy heart, and the heart of thy seed: that then mayst love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul, that thou mayst live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> And he will turn all these curses upon thy enemies, and upon them that hate and persecute thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> But thou shalt return, and hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and shalt do all the commandments which I command thee this day: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> And the Lord thy God will make thee abound in all the works of thy hands, in the fruit of thy womb, and in the fruit of thy cattle, in the fruitfulness of thy land, and in the plenty of all things. For the Lord will return to rejoice over thee in all good things, as he rejoiced in thy fathers: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> Yet so if thou hear the voice of the Lord thy God, and keep his precepts and ceremonies, which are written in this law: and return to the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> This commandment, that I command thee this day is not above thee, nor far off from thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> Nor is it in heaven, that thou shouldst say: Which of us can go up to heaven to bring it unto us, and we may hear and fulfil it in work? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> Nor is it beyond the sea: that thou mayst excuse thyself, and say: Which of us can cross the sea, and bring it unto us: that we may hear, and do that which is commanded? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth and in thy heart, that thou mayst do it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> Consider that I have set before thee this day life and good, and on the other hand death and evil: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> That thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways, and keep his commandments and ceremonies and judgments, and thou mayst live, and he may multiply thee, and bless thee in the land, which thou shalt go in to possess. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> But if thy heart be turned away, so that thou wilt not hear, and being deceived with error thou adore strange gods, and serve them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> I foretell thee this day that thou shalt perish, and shalt remain but a short time in the land, to which thou shalt pass over the Jordan, and shalt go in to possess it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> I call heaven and earth to witness this day, that I have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing. Choose therefore life, that both thou and thy seed may live: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> And that thou mayst love the Lord thy God, and obey his voice, and adhere to him (for he is thy life, and the length of thy days,) that thou mayst dwell in the land, for which the Lord swore to thy fathers Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob that he would give it them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> And Moses went, and spoke all these words to all Israel, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> And he said to them: I am this day a hundred and twenty years old, I can no longer go out and come in, especially as the Lord also hath said to me: Thou shalt not pass over this Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> The Lord thy God then will pass over before thee: he will destroy all these nations in thy sight, and thou shalt possess them: and this Josue shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath spoken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> And the Lord shall do to them as he did to Sehon and Og the kings of the Amorrhites, and to their land, and shall destroy them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> Therefore when the Lord shall have delivered these also to you, you shall do in like manner to them as I have commanded you, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> Do manfully and be of good heart: fear not, nor be ye dismayed at their sight: for the Lord thy God he himself is thy leader, and will not leave thee nor forsake thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> And Moses called Josue, and said to him before all Israel: Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring this people into the land which the Lord swore he would give to their fathers, and thou shalt divide it by lot. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> And the Lord who is your leader, he himself will be with thee: he will not leave thee, nor forsake thee: fear not, neither be dismayed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it to the priests the sons of Levi, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and to all the ancients of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> And he commanded them, saying: After seven years, in the year of remission, in the feast of tabernacles, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> When all Israel come together, to appear in the sight of the Lord thy God in the place which the Lord shall choose, thou shalt read the words of this law before all Israel, in their hearing, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> And the people being all assembled together, both men and women, children and strangers, that are within thy gates: that hearing they may learn, and fear the Lord your God, and keep, and fulfil all the words of this law: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> That their children also, who now are ignorant, may hear, and fear the Lord their God, all the days that they lire in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> And the Lord said to Moses: Behold the days of thy death are nigh: call Josue, and stand ye in the tabernacle of the testimony, that I may give him a charge. So Moses and Josue went and stood in the tabernacle of the testimony: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> And the Lord appeared there in the pillar of a cloud, which stood in the en try of the tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> And the Lord said to Moses: Behold thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, and this people rising up will go a fornicating after strange gods in the land, to which it goeth in to dwell: there will they forsake me, and will make void the covenant, which I have made with them, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> And my wrath shall be kindled against them in that day: and I will forsake them, and will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured: all evils and afflictions shall find them, so that they shall say in that day: In truth it is because God is not with me, that these evils have found me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> But I will hide, and cover my face in that day, for all the evils which they have done, because they have followed strange gods.. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> Now therefore write you this canticle, and teach the children of Israel: that they may know it by heart, and sing it by mouth, and this song may be unto me for a testimony among the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> For I will bring them into the land, for which I swore to their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey. And when they have eaten, and are full and fat, they will turn away after strange gods, and will serve them: and will despise me, and make void my covenant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> And after many evils and afflictions shall have come upon them, this canticle shall answer them for a testimony, which no oblivion shall take away out of the mouth of their seed. For I know their thoughts, and what they are about to de this day, before that I bring them into the land which I have promised them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> Moses therefore wrote the canticle and taught it to the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> And the Lord commanded Josue the son of Nun, and said: Take courage, and be valiant: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into the land which I have promised, and I will be with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> Therefore after Moses had wrote the words of this law in a volume, and finished it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> He commanded the Levites, who carried the ark of the covenant of the Lord. saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> Take this book, and put it in the side of the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God: that it may be there for a testimony against thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> For I know thy obstinacy, and thy most stiff neck, While I am yet living, and going in with you, you have always been rebellious against the Lord: how much more when I shall be dead? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> Gather unto me all the ancients of your tribes, and your doctors, and I will speak these words in their hearing, and will call heaven and earth to witness against them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> For I know that, after my death, you will do wickedly, and will quickly turn aside from the way that I have commanded you: and evils shall come upon you in the latter times, when you shall do evil in the sight of the Lord, to provoke him by the works of your hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> Moses therefore spoke, in the hearing of the whole assembly of Israel, the words of this canticle, and finished it even to the end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> Hear, O ye heavens, the things I speak, let the earth give ear to the words of my mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> Let my doctrine gather as the rain, let my speech distil as the dew, as a shower upon the herb, and as drops upon the grass. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> Because I will invoke the name of the Lord: give ye magnificence to our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> The works of God are perfect, and all his ways are judgments: God is faithful and without any iniquity, he is just and right. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> They have sinned against him, and are nose of his children in their filth: they are a wicked and perverse generation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> Is this the return thou makest to the Lord, O foolish and senseless people? Is not he thy father, that hath possessed thee, and made thee, and created thee? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> Remember the days of old, think upon every generation: ask thy father, and he will declare to thee: thy elders and they will tell thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> When the Most High divided the nations: when he separated the sons of Adam, he appointed the bounds of people according to the number of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> But the Lord's portion is his people: Jacob the lot of his inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> He found him in a desert land, in a place of horror, and of vast wilderness: he led him about, and taught him: and he kept him as the apple of his eye. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> As the eagle enticing her young to fly, and hovering over them, he spread his wings, and hath taken him and carried him on his shoulders. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> The Lord alone was his leader: and there was no strange god with him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> He set him upon high land: that he might eat the fruits of the fields, that he might suck honey out of the rock, and oil out of the hardest stone, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> Butter of the herd, and milk of the sheep with the fat of lambs, and of the rams of the breed of Basan: and goats with the marrow of wheat, and might drink the purest blood of the grape. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> The beloved grew fat, and kicked: he grew fat, and thick and gross, he forsook God who made him, and departed from God his saviour. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> They provoked him by strange gods, and stirred him up to anger, with their abominations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> They sacrificed to devils and not to God: to gods whom they knew not: that were newly come up, whom their fathers worshipped not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> Thou hast forsaken the God that beget thee, and hast forgotten the Lord that created thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> The Lord saw, and was moved to wrath: because his own sons and daughters provoked him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And he said: I will hide my face from them, and will consider what their last end shall be: for it is a perverse generation, and unfaithful children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> They have provoked me with that which was no god, and have angered me with their vanities: and I will provoke them with that which is no people, and will vex them with a foolish nation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> A fire is kindled in my wrath, and shall burn even to the lowest hell: and shall devour the earth with her increase, and shall burn the foundations of the mountains. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> I will heap evils upon them, and will spend my arrows among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> They shall be consumed with famine, and birds shall devour them with a most bitter bite: I will send the teeth of beasts upon them, with the fury of creatures that trail upon the ground, and of serpents. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> Without, the sword shall lay them waste, and terror within, both the young man and the virgin, the sucking child with the man in years. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> I said: Where are they? I will make the memory of them to cease from among men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> But for the wrath of the enemies I have deferred it: lest perhaps their enemies might be proud, and should say: Our mighty hand, and not the Lord, hath done all these things. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> They are a nation without counsel, and without wisdom. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> O that they would be wise and would understand, and would provide for their last end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> How should one pursue after a thousand, and two chase ten thousand? Was it not, because their God had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> For our God is not as their gods: our enemies themselves are judges. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> Their vines are of the vineyard of Sodom, and of the suburbs of Gomorrha: their grapes are grapes of gall, and their clusters most bitter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> Their wine is the gall of dragons, and the venom of asps, which is incurable. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> Are not these things stored up with me, and sealed up in my treasures? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> Revenge is mine, and I will repay them in due time, that their foot may slide: the day of destruction is at hand, and the time makes haste to come. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:36">32:36</a> The Lord will judge his people, and will have mercy on his servants : he shall see that their hand is weakened, and that they who were shut up have also failed, and they that remained are consumed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:37">32:37</a> And he shall say: Where are their gods, in whom they trusted? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:38">32:38</a> Of whose victims they ate the fat, and drank the wine of their drink offerings: let them arise and help you, and protect you in your distress. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:39">32:39</a> See ye that I alone am, and there is no other God besides me: I will kill and I will make to live: I will strike, and I will heal, and there is none that can deliver out of my hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:40">32:40</a> I will lift up my hand to heaven, and I will say: I live for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:41">32:41</a> If I shall whet my sword as the lightning, and my hand take hold on judgment: I will render vengeance to my enemies, and repay them that hate me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:42">32:42</a> I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour flesh, of the blood of the slain and of the captivity, of the bare head of the enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:43">32:43</a> Praise his people, ye nations, for he will revenge the blood of his servants: and will render vengeance to their enemies, and he will be merciful to the land of his people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:44">32:44</a> So Moses came and spoke all the words of this canticle in the ears of the people, and Josue the son of Nun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:45">32:45</a> And he ended all these words, speaking to all Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:46">32:46</a> And he said to them : Set your hearts on all the words, which I testify to you this day: which you shall command your children to observe and to do, and to fulfil all that is written in this law: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:47">32:47</a> For they are not commanded you in vain, but that every one should live in them, and that doing them you may continue a long time in the land whither you are going over the Jordan to possess it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:48">32:48</a> And the Lord spoke to Moses the same day, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:49">32:49</a> Go up into this mountain Abarim, (that is to say, of passages,) unto mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab over against Jericho: and see the land of Chanaan, which I will deliver to the children of Israel to possess, and die thou in the mountain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:50">32:50</a> When thou art gone up into it thou shalt be gathered to thy people, as Aaron thy brother died in mount Her, and was gathered to his people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:51">32:51</a> Because you trespassed against me in the midst of the children of Israel, at the waters of contradiction in Cades of the desert of Sin: and you did not sanctify me among the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:52">32:52</a> Thou shalt see the land before thee, which I will give to the children of Israel, but thou shalt not enter into it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> This is the blessing, wherewith the man of God Moses blessed the children of Israel, before his death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> And he said: The Lord came from Sinai, and from Seir he rose up to us: he hath appeared from mount Pharan, and with him thousands of saints. In his right hand a fiery law. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> He hath loved the people, all the saints are in his hand: and they that approach to his feet, shall receive of his doctrine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> Moses commanded us a law, the inheritance of the multitude of Jacob. </p>
