  <h3 align="center">Douay-Rheims Bible: Ezekiel</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Now it came to pass in the thirtieth year, in the fourth month, on the fifth day of the month, when I was in the midst of the captives by the river Chobar, the heavens were opened, and I saw the visions of God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> On the fifth day of the month, the same was the fifth year of the captivity of king Joachin, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> The word of the Lord came to Ezechiel the priest the son of Bud in the land of the Chaldeans, by the river Chobar: and the hand of the Lord was there upon him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And I saw, and behold a whirlwind came out of the north: and a great cloud, and a fire infolding it, and brightness was about it: and out of the midst thereof, that is, out of the midst of the fire, as it were the resemblance of amber: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And in the midst thereof the likeness of four living creatures: and this was their appearance: there was the likeness of a man in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Every one had four faces, and every one four wings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Their feet were straight feet, and the sole of their foot was like the sole of a calf's foot, and they sparkled like the appearance of glowing brass. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And they had the hands of a man under their wings on their four sides: and they bad faces, and wings on the four sides, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And the wings of one were joined to the wings of another. They turned not when they went: but every one went straight forward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And as for the likeness of their faces: there was the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side of all the four: and the face of an ox, on the left side of all the four: and the face of an eagle over all the four. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And their faces, and their wings were stretched upward: two wings of every one were joined, and two covered their bodies: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And every one of them went straight forward: whither the impulse of the spirit was to go, thither they went: and they turned not when they went. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And as for the likeness of the living creatures, their appearance was like that of burning coals of fire, and like the appearance of lamps. This was the vision running to and fro in the midst of the living creatures, a bright fire, and lightning going forth from the fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And the living creatures ran and returned like flashes of lightning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Now as I beheld the living creatures, there appeared upon the earth by the living creatures one wheel with four faces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And the appearance of the wheels, and the work of them was like the appearance of the sea: and the four had all one likeness: and their appearance and their work was as it were a wheel in the midst of a wheel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> When they went, they went by their four parts: and they turned not when they went. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> The wheels had also a size, and a height, and a dreadful appearance: and the whole body was full of eyes round about all the four. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And when the living creatures went, the wheels also went together by them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up with them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Whithersoever the spirit went, thither as the spirit went the wheels also were lifted up withal, and followed it: for the spirit of life was in the wheels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> When those went these went, and when those stood these stood, and when those were lifted up from the earth, the wheels also were lifted up together, and followed them: for the spirit of life was in the wheels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And over the heads of the living creatures was the likeness of the firmament, as the appearance of crystal terrible to behold, and stretched out over their heads above. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> And under the firmament were their wings straight, the one toward the other, every one with two wings covered his body, and the other was covered in like manner. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> And I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of many waters, as it were the voice of the most high God: when they walked, it was like the voice of a multitude, like the noise of an army, and when they stood, their wings were let down. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> For when a voice came from above the firmament, that was over their heads, they stood, and let down their wings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> And above the firmament that was over their heads, was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of the sapphire stone, and upon the likeness of the throne, was a likeness as of the appearance of a man above upon it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> And I saw as it were the resemblance of amber as the appearance of fire within it round about: from his loins and upward, and from his loins downward, I saw as it were the resemblance of fire shining round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> As the appearance of the rainbow when it is in a cloud on a rainy day: this was the appearance of the brightness round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> This was the vision of the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I saw, and I fell upon my face, and I heard the voice of one that spoke. And he said to me: Son of man, stand upon thy feet, and I will speak to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And the spirit entered into me after that he spoke to me, and he set me upon my feet: and I heard him speaking to me, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And saying: Son of man, I send thee to the children of Israel, to a rebellious people, that hath revolted from me, they, and their fathers, have transgressed my covenant even unto this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And they to whom I send thee are children of a hard face, and of an obstinate heart: and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> If so be they at least will hear, and if so be they will forbear, for they are a provoking house: and they shall know that there hath been a prophet in the midst of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And thou, O son of man, fear not, neither be thou afraid of their words: for thou art among unbelievers and destroyers, and thou dwellest with scorpions. Fear not their words, neither be thou dismayed at their looks: for they are a provoking house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And thou shalt speak my words to them, if perhaps they will hear, and forbear: for they provoke me to anger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> But thou, O son of man, hear all that I say to thee: and do not thou provoke me, as that house provoketh me: open thy mouth, and eat what I give thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And I looked, and behold, a hand was sent to me, wherein was a book rolled up: and he spread it before me, and it was written within and without: and there were written in it lamentations, and canticles, and woe. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And he said to me: Son of man, eat all that thou shalt find: eat this book, and go speak to the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And I opened my mouth, and he caused me to eat that book : </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And he said to me: Son of man, thy belly shall eat, and thy bowels shall be filled with this book, which I give thee. And I did eat it: and it was sweet as honey in my mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And he said to me: Son of man, go to the house of Israel, and thou shalt speak my words to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> For thou art not sent to a people of a profound speech, and of an unknown tongue, but to the house of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> Nor to many nations of a strange speech, and of an unknown tongue, whose words thou canst not understand: and if thou wert sent to them, they would hearken to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> But the house of Israel will not hearken to thee: because they will not hearken to me: for all the house of Israel are of a hard forehead and an obstinate heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Behold I have made thy face stronger than their faces: and thy forehead harder than their foreheads. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> I have made thy face like an adamant and like flint: fear them not, neither be thou dismayed at their presence: for they are a provoking house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And he said to me: Son of man, receive in thy heart, and hear with thy ears, all the words that I speak to thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And go get thee in to them of the captivity, to the children of thy people, and thou shalt speak to them, and shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord: If so be they will hear and will forbear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And the spirit took me up, and I heard behind me the voice of a great commotion, saying: Blessed be the glory of the Lord, from his place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And the noise of the wings of the living creatures striking one against another, and the noise of the wheels following the living creatures, and the noise of a great commotion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> The spirit also lifted me, and took me up: and I went away in bitterness in the indignation of my spirit: for the hand of the Lord was with me, strengthening me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And I came to them of the captivity, to the heap of new corn, to them that dwelt by the river Chobar, and I sat where they sat: and I remained there seven days mourning in the midst of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And at the end of seven days the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: and thou shalt hear the word out of my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> If, when I say to the wicked, Thou shalt surely die: thou declare it not to him, nor speak to him, that he may be converted from his wicked way, and live: the same wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> But if thou give warning to the wicked, and he be not converted from his wickedness, and from his evil way: he indeed shall die in his iniquity, but thou hast delivered thy soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> Moreover if the just man shall turn away from his justice, and shall commit iniquity: I will lay a stumblingblock before him, he shall die, because thou hast not given him warning: he shall die in his sin, and his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: but I will require his blood at thy hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> But if thou warn the just man, that the just may not sin, and he doth not sin: living he shall live, because thou hast warned him, and thou hast delivered thy soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And the hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me: Rise and go forth into the plain, and there I will speak to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And I rose up, and went forth into the plain: and behold the glory of the Lord stood there, like the glory which I saw by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> And the spirit entered into me, and set me upon my feet: and he spoke to me, and said to me: Go in; and shut thyself up in the midst of thy house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> And thou, O son of man, behold they shall put bands upon thee, and they shall bind thee with them: and thou shalt not go forth from the midst of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And I will make thy tongue stick fast to the roof of thy mouth, and thou shalt be dumb, and not as a man that reproveth: because they are a provoking house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> But when I shall speak to thee, I will open thy mouth, and thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: He that heareth, let him hear: and he that forbeareth, let him forbear: for they are a provoking house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And thou, O son of man, take thee a tile, and lay it before thee: and draw upon it the plan of the city of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And lay siege against it, and build forts, and cast up a mount, and set a camp against it, and place battering rams round about it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And take unto thee an iron pan, and set it for a wall of iron between thee and the city: and set thy face resolutely against it, and it shall be besieged, and thou shalt lay siege against it: it is a sign to the house of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And thou shalt sleep upon thy left side, and shalt lay the iniquities of the house of Israel upon it, according to the number of the days that thou shalt sleep upon it, and thou shalt take upon thee their iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And I have laid upon thee the years of their iniquity, according to the number of the days three hundred and ninety days: and thou shalt bear the iniquity of the house of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And when thou hast accomplished this, thou shalt sleep again upon thy right side, and thou shalt take upon thee the iniquity of the house of Juda forty days: a day for it year, yea, a day for a year I have appointed to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And thou shalt turn thy face to the siege of Jerusalem, and thy arm shall be stretched out: and thou shalt prophesy against it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Behold I have encompassed thee with bands: and thou shalt not turn thyself from one side to the other, till thou hast ended the days of thy siege. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And take to thee wheat and barley, and beans, and lentils, and millet, and fitches, and put them in one vessel, and make thee bread thereof according to the number of the days that thou shalt lie upon thy side: three hundred and ninety days shalt thou eat thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And thy meat that thou shalt eat, shall be in weight twenty staters a day: from time to time thou shalt eat it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And thou shalt drink water by measure, the sixth part of a hin: from time to time thou shalt drink it, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And thou shalt eat it as barley bread baked under the ashes: and thou shalt cover it, in their sight, with the dung that cometh out of a man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And the Lord said: So shall the children of Israel eat their bread all filthy among the nations whither I will cast them out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God, behold my soul hath not been defiled, and from my infancy even till now, I have not eaten any thing that died of itself, or was torn by beasts, and no unclean flesh hath entered into my mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And he said to me: Behold I have given thee neat's dung for man's dung, and thou shalt make thy bread therewith. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And he said to me: Son of man: Behold, I will break in pieces the staff of bread in Jerusalem: and they shall eat bread by weight, and with care: and they shall drink water by measure, and in distress. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> So that when bread and water fail, every man may fall against his brother, and they may pine away in their iniquities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And thou, son of man, take thee a sharp knife that shaveth the hair: and cause it to pass over thy head, and over thy beard: and take thee a balance to weigh in, and divide the hair. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> A third part thou shalt burn with fire in the midst of the city, according to the fulfilling of the days of the siege: and thou shalt take a third part, and cut it in pieces with the knife all round about: and the other third part thou shalt scatter in the wind, and I will draw out the sword after them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And thou shalt take thereof a small number: and shalt bind them in the skirt of thy cloak. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And thou shalt take of them again, and shalt cast them in the midst of the fire, and shalt burn them with fire: and out of it shall come forth a fire into all the house of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Thus saith the Lord God: This is Jerusalem, I have set her in the midst of the nations, and the countries round about her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And she hath despised my judgments, so as to be more wicked than the Gentiles; and my commandments, more than the countries that are round about her: for they have cast off my judgments, and have not walked in my commandments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have surpassed the Gentiles that are round about you, and have not walked in my commandments, and have not kept my judgments, and have not done according to the judgments of the nations that are round about you: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, and I myself will execute judgments in the midst of thee in the sight of the Gentiles. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And I will do in thee that which I have not done: and the like to which I will do no more, because of all thy abominations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Therefore the fathers shall eat the sons in the midst of thee, and the sons shall eat their fathers: and I will execute judgments in thee, and I will scatter thy whole remnant into every wind. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God : Because thou hast violated my sanctuary with all thy offences, and with ail thy abominations: I will also break thee in pieces, and my eye shall not spare, and I will not have any pity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> A third part of thee shall die with the pestilence, and shall be consumed with famine in the midst of thee: and a third part of thee shall fall by the sword round about thee: and a third part of thee will I scatter into every wind, and I will draw out a sword after them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And I will accomplish my fury, and will cause my indignation to rest upon them, and I will be comforted: and they shall know that I the Lord have spoken it in my zeal, when I shall have accomplished my indignation in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And I will make thee desolate, and a reproach among the nations that are round about thee, in the sight of every one that passeth by. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And thou shalt be a reproach, and a scoff, an example, and an astonishment amongst the nations that are round about thee, when I shall have executed judgments in thee in anger, and in indignation, and in wrathful rebukes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> I the Lord have spoken it: When I shall send upon them the grievous arrows of famine, which shall bring death, and which I will send to destroy you: and I will gather together famine against you: and I will break among you the staff of bread. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And I will send in upon you famine, and evil beasts unto utter destruction: and pestilence, and blood shall pass through thee, and I will bring in the sword upon thee. I the Lord have spoken it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Son of man, set thy face towards the mountains of Israel, and prophesy against them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus Faith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, and to the rocks, and the valleys: Behold, I will bring upon you the sword, and I will destroy your high places. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And I will throw down your altars, and your idols shall be broken in pieces: and I will cast down your slain before your idols. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And I will lay the dead carcasses of the children of Israel before your idols: and I will scatter Sour bones round about your altars, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> In all your dwelling places. The cities shall be laid waste, and the high places shall be thrown down, and destroyed, and your altars shall be abolished, and shall be broken in pieces: and your idols shall be no more, and your temples shall be destroyed, and your works shall be defaced. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And the slain shall fall in the midst of you: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And I will leave in you some that shall escape the sword among the nations, when I shall have scattered you, through the countries. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And they that are saved of you shall remember me amongst the nations to which they are carried captives: because I have broken their heart that was faithless, and revolted from me: and their eyes that went a fornicating after their idols: and they shall be displeased with themselves because of the evils which they have committed in all their abominations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And they shall know that I the Lord have not spoken in vain that I would do this evil to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Strike with thy hand, and stamp with thy foot, and say: Alas, for all the abominations of the evils of the house of Israel: for they shall fall by the sword, by the famine and by the pestilence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> He that is far off shall die of the pestilence: and he that is near, shall fall by the sword: and he that remaineth, and is besieged, shall die by the famine: and I will accomplish my indignation upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And you shall know that I am the Lord, when your slain shall be amongst your idols, round about your altars, in every high hill, and on all the tops of mountains, and under every woody tree, and under every thick oak, the place where they burnt sweet smelling frankincense to all their idols. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And I will stretch forth my hand upon them: and I will make the land desolate, and abandoned from the desert of Deblatha in all their dwelling places: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And thou son of man, thus saith the Lord God to the land of Israel: The end is come, the end is come upon the four quarters of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> Now is an end come upon thee, and I will send my wrath upon thee, and I will judge thee according to thy ways: and I will set all thy abominations against thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And my eye shall not spare thee, and I will shew thee no pity: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Thus saith the Lord God: One affliction, behold an affliction is come. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> An end is come, the end is come, it hath awaked against thee: behold it is come. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Destruction is come upon thee that dwellest in the land: the time is come, the day of slaughter is near, and not of the joy of mountains. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Now very shortly I will pour out my wrath upon thee, and I will accomplish my anger in thee: and I will judge thee according to thy ways, and I will lay upon thee all thy crimes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And my eye shall not spare, neither will I shew mercy: but I will lay thy ways upon thee, and thy abominations shall be in the midst of thee: and you shall know that I am the Lord that strike. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> Behold the day, behold it is come: destruction is gone forth, the rod hath blossomed, pride hath budded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Iniquity is risen up into a rod of impiety: nothing of them shall remain, nor of their people, nor of the noise of them: and there shall be no rest among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> The time is come, the day is at hand: let not the buyer rejoice: nor the seller mourn: for wrath is upon all the people thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> For the seller shall not return to that which he hath sold, although their life be yet among the living. For the vision which regardeth all the multitude thereof, shall not go back: neither shall man be strengthened in the iniquity of his life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Blow the trumpet, let all be made ready, yet there is none to go to the battle: for my wrath shall be upon all the people thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> The sword without: and the pestilence, and the famine within: he that is in the field shall die by the sword: and they that are in the city, shall be devoured by the pestilence, and the famine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And such of them as shall flee shall escape: and they shall be in the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them trembling, every one for his iniquity. </p>

 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> Their silver shall be cast forth, and their gold shall become a dunghill. Their silver and their gold shall not be able to deliver them in the day of the wrath of the Lord. They shall not satisfy their soul, and their bellies shall not be filled: because it hath been the stumblingblock of their iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And they have turned the ornament of their jewels into pride, and have made of it the images of their abominations, and idols: therefore I have made it an uncleanness to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And I will give it into the hands of strangers for spoil, and to the wicked of the earth for a prey, and they shall defile it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> And I will turn away my face from them, and they shall violate my secret place: and robbers shall enter into it, and defile it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> Make a shutting up: for the land is full of the judgment of blood, and the city is full of iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And I will bring the worse of the nations, and they shall possess their houses: and I will make the pride of the mighty to cease, and they shall possess their sanctuary. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> When distress cometh upon them, they will seek for peace and there shall be none. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> Trouble shall come upon trouble, and rumour upon rumour, and they shall seek a vision of the prophet, and the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients. </p>

 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And it came to pass in the sixth year, in the sixth month, in the fifth day of the month, as I sat in my house, and the ancients of Juda sat before me, that the hand of the Lord God fell there upon me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And I saw, and behold a likeness as the appearance of fire: from the appearance of his loins, and downward, fire: and from his loins, and upward, as the appearance of brightness, as the appearance of amber. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And the likeness of a hand was put forth and took me by a lock of my head: and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven, and brought me in the vision of God into Jerusalem, near the inner gate, that looked toward the north, where was set the idol of jealousy to provoke to jealousy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And behold the glory of the God of Israel was there, according to the vision which I had seen in the plain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And he said to me: Son of man, lift up thy eyes towards the way of the north. And I lifted up my eyes towards the way of the north: and behold on the north side of the gate of the altar the idol of jealousy in the very entry. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou see, thinkest thou, what these are doing, the great abominations that the house of Israel committeth here, that I should depart far off from my sanctuary? and turn thee yet again and thou shalt see greater abominations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And he brought me in to the door of the court: and I saw, and behold a hole in the wall. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And he said to me: Son of man, dig in the wall. And when I had digged in the wall, behold a door. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And he said to me: Go in, and see the wicked abominations which they commit here. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And I went in and saw, and behold every form of creeping things, and of living creatures, the abomination, and all the idols of the house of Israel, were painted on the wall all round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And seventy men of the ancients of the house of Israel, and Jezonias the son of Saaphan stood in the midst of them, that stood before the pictures: and every one had a censer in his hand: and a cloud of smoke went up from the incense. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And he add to me: Surely thou seest. O son of man, what the ancients of the house of Israel do in the dark, every one in private in his chamber: for they say: The Lord seeth us not, the Lord hath forsaken the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And he said to me: If thou turn thee again, thou shalt see greater abominations which these commit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And he brought me in by the door of the gate of the Lord's house, which looked to the north: and behold women sat there mourning for Adonis. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man: but turn thee again: and thou shalt see greater abominations than these. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And he brought me into the inner court of the house of the Lord: and behold at the door of the temple of the Lord, between the porch and the altar, were about five and twenty men having their backs towards the temple of the Lord, and their faces to the east: and they adored towards the rising of the sun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And he said to me: Surely thou hast seen, O son of man: is this a light thing to the house of Juda, that they should commit these abominations which they have committed here: because they have filled the land with iniquity, and have turned to provoke me to anger? and behold they put a branch to their nose. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> Therefore I also will deal with them in my wrath: my eye shall not spare them, neither will I shew mercy: and when they shall cry to my ears with a loud voice, I will not hear them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And he cried in my ears with a loud voice, saying: The visitations of the city are at hand, and every one hath a destroying weapon in his hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And behold six men came from the way of the upper gate, which looketh to the north: and each one had his weapon of destruction in his hand: and there was one man in the midst of them clothed with linen, with a writer's inkhorn at his reins: and they went in, and stood by the brazen altar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And the glory of the Lord of Israel went up from the cherub, upon which he was, to the threshold of the house: and he called to the man that was clothed with linen, and had a writer's inkhorn at his loins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> And the Lord said to him: Go through the midst of the city, through the midst of Jerusalem: and mark Thau upon the foreheads of the men that sigh, and mourn for all the abominations that are committed in the midst thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And to the others he said in my hearing: Go ye after him through the city, and strike: let not your eyes spare, nor be ye moved with pity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Utterly destroy old and young, maidens, children and women: but upon whomsoever you shall see Thau, kill him not, and begin ye at my sanctuary. So they began at the ancient men who mere before the house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And he said to them: Defile the house, and ill the courts with the slain: go ye forth. And they went forth, and slew them that were in the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And the slaughter being ended I was left: and I fell upon my face, and crying, I said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God, wilt thou then destroy all the remnant of Israel, by pouring out thy fury upon Jerusalem? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And he said to me: The iniquity of the house of Israel, and of Juda, is exceeding great, and the land is filled with blood, and the city is filled with perverseness: for they have said: The Lord hath forsaken the earth, and the Lord seeth not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> Therefore neither shall my eye spare, nor will I have pity: I will requite their way upon their head. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And behold the man that was clothed with linen, that had the inkhorn at his back, returned the word, saying: I have done as thou hast commanded me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And I saw and behold in the firmament that was over the heads of the cherubims, there appeared over them as it were the sapphire stone, as the appearance of the likeness of a throne. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> And he spoke to the man, that was clothed with linen, and said: Go in between the wheels that are under the cherubims and fill thy hand with the coals of fire that are between the cherubims, and pour them out upon the city. And he went in, in my sight: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And the cherubims stood on the right side of the house, when the man went in, and a cloud filled the inner court. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> And the glory of the Lord was lifted up from above the cherub to the threshold of the house: and the house was filled with the cloud, and the court was filled with the brightness of the glory of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And the sound of the wings of the cherubims was heard even to the out- ward court as the voice of God Almighty speaking. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And when he had commanded the man that was clothed with linen, saying: Take fire from the midst of the wheels that are between the cherubims: he went in and stood beside the wheel, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And one cherub stretched out his arm from the midst of the cherubims to the fire that was between the cherubims: and he took, and put it into the hands of him that was clothed with linen: who took it and went forth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And there appeared in the cherubims the likeness of a man's hand under their wings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And I saw, and behold there were four wheels by the cherubims: one wheel by one cherub, and another wheel by an- other cherub: and the appearance of the wheels was to the sight like the chrysolite stone: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And as to their appearance, all four were alike: as if a wheel were in the midst of a wheel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And when they went, they went by four ways: and they turned not when they went: but to the place whither they first turned, the rest also followed, and did not turn back. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And their whole body, and their necks, and their hands, and their wings, and the circles were full of eyes, round about the four wheels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And these wheels he called voluble, in my hearing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And every one had four faces: one face was the face of a cherub, and the second face, the face of a man: and in the third was the face of a lion: and in the fourth the face of an eagle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And the cherubims were lifted up: this is the living creature that I had seen by the river Chobar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And when the cherubims went, the wheels also went by them: and when the cherubims lifted up their wings, to mount up from the earth, the wheels stayed not behind, but were by them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> When they stood, these stood: and when they were lifted up, these were lifted up: for the spirit of life was in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> And the glory of the Lord went forth from the threshold of the temple: and stood over the cherubims. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And the cherubims lifting up their wings, were raised from the earth before me: and as they went out, the wheels also followed: and it stood in the entry of the east gate of the house of the Lord: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> This is the living creature, which I saw under the God of Israel by the river Chobar: and I understood that they were cherubims. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> Each one had four faces, and each one had four wings: and the likeness of a man's hand was under their wings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> And as to the likeness of their faces, they were the same faces which I had seen by the river Chobar, and their looks, and the impulse of every one to go straight forward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into the east gate of the house of the Lord, which looketh towards the rising of the sun: and behold in the entry of the gate five and twenty men: and I saw in the midst of them Jezonias the son of Azur, and Pheltias the son of Banaias, princes of the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> And he said to me: Son of man, these are the men that study iniquity, and frame a wicked counsel in this city, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> Saying: Were not houses lately built? This city is the caldron, and we the flesh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> Therefore prophesy against them, prophesy, thou son of man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And the spirit of the Lord fell upon me, and said to me: Speak: Thus saith the Lord: Thus have you spoken, O house of Israel, for I know the thoughts of your heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> You have killed a great many in this city, and you have filled the streets thereof with the slain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Your slain, whom you have laid in the midst thereof, they are the flesh, and this is the caldron: and I will bring you forth out of the midst thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> You have feared the sword, and I will bring the sword upon you, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And I will cast you out of the midst thereof, and I will deliver you into the hand of the enemies, and I will execute judgments upon you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> You shall fall by the sword: I will judge you in the borders of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> This shall not be as a caldron to you, and you shall not be as flesh in the midst thereof: I will judge you in the borders of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And you shall know that I am the Lord: because you have not walked in my commandments, and have not done my judgments, but you have done according to the judgments of the nations that; are round about you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And it came to pass, when I prophesied, that Pheltias the son of Banaias died: and I fell down upon my face, and cried with a loud voice: and said: Alas, alas, alas, O Lord God: wilt thou make an end of all the remnant of Israel? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> Son of man, thy brethren, thy brethren, thy kinsmen, and all the house of Israel, all they to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said: Get ye far from the Lord, the land is given in possession to us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because I have removed them far off among the Gentiles, and because I have scattered them among the countries: I will be to them a little sanctuary in the countries whither they are come. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> Therefore speak to them: Thus saith the Lord God: I will gather you from among the peoples, and assemble you out of the countries wherein you are scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And they shall go in thither, and shall take away all the scandals, and all the abominations thereof from thence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> And I will give them one heart, and will put a new spirit in their bowels: and I will take away the stony heart out of their flesh, and will give them a heart of flesh: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> That they may walk in my commandments, and keep my judgments, and do them: and that they may be my people, and I may be their God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> But as for them whose heart walketh after their scandals and abominations, I will lay their way upon their head, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> And the cherubims lifted up their wings, and the wheels with them: and the glory of the God of Israel was over them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> And the glory of the Lord went up from the midst of the city, and stood over the mount that is on the east side of the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> And the spirit lifted me up, and brought me into Chaldea, to them of the captivity, in vision, by the spirit of God: and the vision which I had seen was taken up from me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> And I spoke to them of the captivity all the words of the Lord, which he had shewn me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> Son of man, thou dwellest in the midst of a provoking house: who have eyes to see, and see not: and ears to hear, and hear not: for they are a provoking house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> Thou, therefore, O son of man, prepare thee all necessaries for removing, and remove by day in their sight: and thou shalt remove out of thy place to another place in their sight, if so be they will regard it: for they are a provoking house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And thou shalt bring forth thy furniture as the furniture of one that is removing by day in their sight: and thou shalt go forth in the evening in their presence, as one goeth forth that removeth his dwelling. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Dig thee a way through the wall before their eyes: and thou shalt go forth through it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> In their sight thou shalt be carried out upon men's shoulders, thou shalt be carried out in the dark: thou shalt cover thy face, and shalt not see the ground: for I have set thee for a sign of things to come to the house of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> I did therefore as he had commanded me: I brought forth my goods by day, as the goods of one that removeth: and in the evening I digged through the wall with my hand: and I went forth in the dark, and was carried on men's shoulders in their sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> And the word of the Lord came to me in the morning, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> Son of man, hath not the house of Israel, the provoking house, said to thee: What art thou doing? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: This burden concerneth my prince that is in Jerusalem, and all the house of Israel, that are among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> Say: I am a sign of things to come to you: as I have done, so shall it be done to them: they shall be removed from their dwellings, and go into captivity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> And the prince that is in the midst of them, shall be carried on shoulders, he shall go forth in the dark: they shall dig through the wall to bring him out: his face shall be covered, that he may not see the ground with his eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, into the land of the Chaldeans, and he shall not see it, and there he shall die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> And all that are about him, his guards, and his troops I will scatter into every wind: and I will draw out the sword after them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have dispersed them among the nations, and scattered them in the countries. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And I will leave a few men of them from the sword, and from the famine, and from the pestilence: that they may declare all their wicked deeds among the nations whither they shall go: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> Son of man, eat thy bread in trouble: and drink thy water in hurry and sorrow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> And say to the people of the land: Thus saith the Lord God to them that dwell in Jerusalem in the land of Israel: They shall eat their bread in care, and drink their water in desolation: that the land may become desolate from the multitude that is therein, for the iniquity of all that dwell therein. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> And the cities that are now inhabited shall be laid waste, and the land shall be desolate: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> Son of man, what is this proverb that you have in the land of Israel? saying: The days shall be prolonged, and every vision shall fail. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> Say to them therefore: Thus saith the Lord God: I will make this proverb to cease, neither shall it be any more a common saying in Israel: and tell them that the days are at hand, and the effect of every vision. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> For there shall be no more any vain visions, nor doubtful divination in the midst of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> For I the Lord will speak: and what word soever I shall speak, it shall come to pass, and shall not be prolonged any more: but in your days, ye provoking house, I will speak the word, and will do it, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:26">12:26</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:27">12:27</a> Son of man, behold the house of Israel, they that say: The vision that this man seeth, is for many days to come: and this men prophesieth of times afar off. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Not one word of mine shall be prolonged any more: the word that I shall speak shall be accomplished, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> Son of man, prophesy thou against the prophets of Israel that prophesy: and thou shalt say to them that prophesy out of their own heart: Hear ye the word of the Lord: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the foolish prophets that follow their own spirit, and see nothing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Thy prophets, O Israel, were like foxes in the deserts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> You have not gone up to face the enemy, nor have you set up a wall for the house of Israel, to stand in battle in the day of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> They see vain things, and they foretell lies, saying: The Lord saith: whereas the Lord hath not sent them: and they have persisted to confirm what they have said. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Have you not seen a vain vision and spoken a lying divination: and you say: The Lord saith: whereas I have not spoken. </p>

 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And my hand shall be upon the prophets that see vain things, and that divine lies: they shall not be in the council of my people, nor shall they be written in the writing of the house of Israel, neither shall they enter into the land of Israel, and you shall know that I am the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> Because they have deceived my people, saying: Peace, and there is no peace: and the people built up a wall, and they daubed it with dirt without straw. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> Say to them that daub without tempering, that it shall fall: for there shall be an overflowing shower, and I will cause great hailstones to fall violently from above, and a stormy wind to throw it down. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> Behold, when the wall is fallen: shall it not be said to you: Where is the daubing wherewith you have daubed it? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Lo, I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in my indignation, and there shall be an overflowing shower in my anger: and great hailstones in my wrath to consume. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> And I will break down the wall that you have daubed with untempered mortar: and I will make it even with the ground, and the foundation thereof shall be laid bare: and it shall fall, and shall be consumed in the midst thereof: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And I will accomplish my wrath upon the wall, and upon them that daub it without tempering the mortar, and I will say to you: The wall is no more, and they that daub it are no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> Even the prophets of Israel that prophesy to Jerusalem, and that see visions of peace for her: and there is no peace, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And thou, son of man, set thy face against the daughters of thy people that prophesy out of their own heart: and do thou prophesy against them, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> And say: Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to them that sew cushions under every elbow: and make pillows for the heads of persons of every age to catch souls: and when they caught the souls of my people, they gave life to their souls. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And they violated me among my people, for a handful of barley, and a piece of bread, to kill souls which should not die, and to save souls alive which should not live, telling lies to my people that believe lies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold I declare against your cushions, wherewith you catch flying souls: and I will tear them off from your arms: and I will let go the souls that you catch, the souls that should fly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> And I will tear your pillows, and will deliver my people out of your hand, neither shall they be any more in your hands to be a prey: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> Because with lies you have made the heart of the just to mourn, whom I have not made sorrowful: and have strengthened the hands of the wicked, that he should not return from his evil way, and live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> Therefore you shall not see vain things, nor divine divinations any more, and I will deliver my people out of your hand: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And some of the ancients of Israel came to me, and sat before me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> Son of man, these men have placed their uncleannesses in their hearts, and have set up before their face the stumblingblock of their iniquity : and shall I answer when they inquire of me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> Therefore speak to them, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Man, man of the house of Israel that shall place his uncleannesses in his heart, and set up the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and shall come to the prophet inquiring of me by him: I the Lord will answer him according to the multitude of his uncleannesses: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> That the house of Israel may be caught in their own heart, with which they have departed from me through all their idols. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> Therefore say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Be converted, and depart from your idols, and turn away your faces from all your abominations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> For every man of the house of Israel, and every stranger among the proselytes in Israel, if he separate himself from me, and place his idols in his heart, and set the stumblingblock of his iniquity before his face, and come to the prophet to inquire of me by him: I the Lord will answer him by myself. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And I will set my face against that man, and will make him an example, and a proverb, and will cut him off from the midst of my people: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And when the prophet shall err, and speak a word: I the Lord have deceived that prophet: and I will stretch forth my hand upon him, and will cut him off from the midst of my people Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And they shall bear their iniquity: according to the iniquity of him that inquireth, so shall the iniquity of the prophet be. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> That the house of Israel may go no more astray from me, nor be polluted with all their transgressions: but may be my people, and I may be their God, saith the Lord of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> Son of man, when a land shall sin against me, so as to transgress grievously, I will stretch forth my hand upon it, and will break the staff of the bread thereof: and I will send famine upon it, and will destroy man and beast out of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And if these three men, Noe, Daniel, and Job, shall be in it: they shall deliver their own souls by their justice, saith the Lord of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And if I shall bring mischievous beasts also upon the land to waste it, and it be desolate, so that there is none that can pass because of the beasts: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> If these three men shall be in it, as I live, saith the Lord, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters: but they only shall be delivered, and the land shall be made desolate. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> Or if I bring the sword upon that land, and say to the sword: Pass through the land: and I destroy man and beast out of it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And these three men be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither sons nor daughters, but they themselves alone shall be delivered. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> Or if I also send the pestilence upon that land, and pour out my indignation upon it in blood, to cut off from it man and beast: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> And Noe, and Daniel, and Job be in the midst thereof: as I live, saith the Lord God, they shall deliver neither son nor daughter: but they shall only deliver their own souls by their justice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> For thus saith the Lord: Although I shall send in upon Jerusalem my four grievous judgments, the sword, and the famine, and the mischievous beasts, and the pestilence, to destroy out of it man and beast, </p>

 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> And they shall comfort you, when you shall see their ways, and their doings : and you shall know that I have not done without cause all that I have done in it, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p>

 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As the vine tree among the trees of the forests which I have given to the fire to be consumed, so will I deliver up the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And I will set my face against them: they shall go out from fire, and fire shall consume them : and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have set my face against them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And I shall have made their land a wilderness, and desolate, because they have been transgressors, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> Son of man, make known to Jerusalem her abominations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> And thou shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God to Jerusalem: Thy root, and thy nativity is of the land of Chanaan, thy father was an Amorrhite, and thy mother a Cethite. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And when thou wast born, in the day of thy nativity thy navel wits not cut, neither wast thou washed with water for thy health, nor salted with salt, nor swaddled with clouts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> No eye had pity on thee to do any of these things for thee, out of compassion to thee: but thou wast cast out upon the face of the earth in the abjection of thy soul, in the day that thou wast born. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> And passing by thee, I saw that thou wast trodden under foot in thy own blood. and I said to thee when thou wast in thy blood: Live: I have said to thee: Live in thy blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> I caused thee to multiply as the bud of the field: and thou didst increase and grow great, and advancedst, and camest to woman's ornament: thy breasts were fashioned, and thy hair grew: and thou wast naked, and full of confusion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> And I passed by thee, and saw thee: and behold thy time was the time of lovers : and I spread my garment over thee, and covered thy ignominy. And I swore to thee, and I entered into a covenant with thee, saith the Lord God: and thou becamest mine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And I washed thee with water, and cleansed away thy blood from thee: and I anointed thee with oil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And I clothed thee with embroidery, and shed thee with violet coloured shoes : and I girded thee about with fine linen, and clothed thee with fine garments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> I decked thee also with ornaments, and put bracelets on thy hands, and a chain about thy neck. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> And I put a jewel upon thy forehead and earrings in thy ears, and a beautiful crown upon thy head. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And thou wast adorned with gold, and silver, and wast clothed with fine linen, and embroidered work, and many colours: thou didst eat fine hour, and honey, and oil, and wast made exceeding beautiful: and wast advanced to be a queen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> And thy renown went forth among the nations for thy beauty: for thou wast perfect through my beauty, which I had put upon thee, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> But trusting in thy beauty, thou playedst the harlot because of thy renown, and thou hast prostituted thyself to every passenger, to be his. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> And taking of thy garments thou hast made thee high places sewed together on each side: and hast played the harlot upon them, as hath not been done before, nor shall be hereafter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> And thou tookest thy beautiful vessels, of my gold, and my silver, which I gave thee, and thou madest thee images of men, and hast committed fornication with them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And thou tookest thy garments of divers colours, and coveredst them : and settest my oil and my sweet incense before them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And my bread which I gave thee, the fine flour, and oil, and honey, wherewith I fed thee, thou hast set before them for a sweet odour; and it was done, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> And thou hast taken thy sons, and thy daughters, whom thou hast borne to me: and best sacrificed the same to them to be devoured. Is thy fornication small? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> Thou hast sacrificed and given my children to them, consecrating them by fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> And after all thy abominations, and fornications, thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, when thou wast naked, and full of confusion, trodden under foot in thy own blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> And it came to pass after all thy wickedness (woe, woe to thee, saith the Lord God) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> That thou didst also build thee a common stew, and madest thee a brothel house in every street. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> At every head of the way thou hast set up a sign of thy prostitution: and hast made thy beauty to be abominable: and hast prostituted thyself to every one that passed by, and hast multiplied thy fornications. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> And thou hast committed fornication with the Egyptians thy neighbours, men of large bodies, and hast multiplied thy fornications to provoke me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> Behold, I will stretch out my hand upon thee, and will take away thy justification: and I will deliver thee up to the will of the daughters of the Philistines that hate thee, that are ashamed of thy wicked way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> Thou hast also committed fornication with the Assyrians, because thou wast not yet satisfied: and after thou hadst played the harlot with them, even so thou wast not contented. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> Thou hast also multiplied thy fornications in the land of Chanaan with the Chaldeans: and neither so wast then satisfied. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> Wherein shall I cleanse thy heart, saith the Lord God: seeing thou dost all these the works of a shameless prostitute? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> Because thou hast built thy brothel house at the head of every way, and thou hast made thy high place in every street: and wast not as a harlot that by disdain enhanceth her price, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> But as an adulteress, that bringeth in strangers over her husband. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> Gifts are given to all harlots: but thou hast given hire to all thy lovers, and thou hast given them gifts to come to thee from every side, to commit fornication with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> And it hath happened in thee contrary to the custom of women in thy fornications, and after thee there shall be no such fornication: for in that thou gavest rewards, and didst not take rewards, the contrary hath been done in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> Therefore, O harlot, hear the word of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Because thy money hath been poured out, and thy shame discovered through thy fornications with thy lovers, and with the idols of thy abominations, by the blood of thy children whom thou gavest them: </p>

 <p><a name="an_16:38">16:38</a> And I will judge thee as adulteresses, and they that shed blood are judged: and I will give thee blood in fury and jealousy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:39">16:39</a> And I will deliver thee into their hands, and they shall destroy thy brothel house, and throw down thy stews: and they shall strip thee of thy garments, and shall take away the vessels of thy beauty: and leave thee naked, and full of disgrace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:40">16:40</a> And they shall bring upon thee a multitude, and they shall stone thee with stones, and shall slay thee with their swords. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:41">16:41</a> 41And they shall burn thy houses with fire, and shall execute judgments upon thee in the sight of many women: and thou shalt cease from fornication, and shalt give no hire any more. </p>

 <p><a name="an_16:43">16:43</a> Because thou hast not remembered the days of thy youth, but hast provoked me in all these things: wherefore I also have turned thy ways upon thy head, saith the Lord God, and I have not done according to thy wicked deeds in all thy abominations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:44">16:44</a> Behold every one that useth a common proverb, shall use this against thee, saying: As the mother was, so also is her daughter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:45">16:45</a> Thou art thy mother's daughter, that cast off her husband, and her children: and thou art the sister of thy sisters, who cast off their husbands, and their children: your mother was a Cethite, and your father an Amorrhite. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:46">16:46</a> And thy elder sister is Samaria, she and her daughters that dwell at thy left hand: and thy younger sister that dwelleth at thy right hand is Sodom, and her daughters. </p>

 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> He cropped off the top of the twigs thereof: and carried it away into the land of Chanaan, and he set it in a city of merchants. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And he took of the seed of the land, and put it in the ground for seed, that it might take a firm root over many waters: he planted it on the surface of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> And it sprung up and grew into a spreading vine of low stature, and the branches thereof looked towards him: and the roots thereof were under him. So it became a vine, and grew into branches, and shot forth sprigs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And there was another large eagle, with great wings, and many feathers: and behold this vine, bending as it were her roots towards him, stretched forth her branches to him, that he might water it by the furrows of her plantation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> It was planted in a good ground upon many waters, that it might bring forth branches, and bear fruit, that it might become a large vine. </p>

 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> Say to the provoking house: Know you not what these things mean? Tell them: Behold the king of Babylon cometh to Jerusalem: and he shall take away the king and the princes thereof, and carry them with him to Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> And he shall take one of the king's seed, and make a covenant with him, and take an oath of him. Yea, and he shall take away the mighty men of the land, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> That it may be a low kingdom and not lift itself up, but keep his covenant, and observe it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> But he hath revolted from him and sent ambassadors to Egypt, that it might give him horses, and much people. And shall he that hath done thus prosper, or be saved? and shall he escape that hath broken the covenant? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> As I live, saith the Lord God: In the place where the king dwelleth that made him king, whose oath he hath made void, and whose covenant he broke, even in the midst of Babylon shall he die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> And not with a great army, nor with much people shall Pharao fight against him: when he shall cast up mounts, and build forts, to cut off many souls. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> For he had despised the oath, breaking his covenant, and behold he hath given his hand: and having done all these things, he shall not escape. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:19">17:19</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: As I live, I will lay upon his head the oath he hath despised, and the covenant he hath broken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:20">17:20</a> And I will spread my net over him, and he shall be taken in my net: and I will bring him into Babylon, and will judge him there for the transgression by which he hath despised me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> And all his fugitives with all his bands shall fall by the sword: and the residue shall be scattered into every wind: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> Thus saith the Lord God: I myself will take of the marrow of the high cedar, and will set it: I will crop off a tender twig from the top of the branches thereof, and I will plant it on a mountain high and eminent. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> On the high mountains of Israel will I plant it, and it shall shoot forth into branches, and shall bear fruit, and it shall become a great cedar: and all birds shall dwell under it, and every fowl shall make its nest under the shadow of the branches thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:24">17:24</a> And all the trees of the country shall know that I the Lord have brought down the high tree, and exalted the low tree: and have dried up the green tree, and have caused the dry tree to flourish. I the Lord have spoken and have done it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: What is the meaning? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> That you use among you this parable as a proverb in the land of Israel, saying: The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the teeth of the children are set on edge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> As I live, saith the Lord God, this parable shall be no more to you a proverb in Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> Behold all souls are mine: as the soul of the father, so also the soul of the son is mine: the soul that sinneth, the same shall die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And if a man be just, and do judgment and justice, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel: and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife, nor come near to a menstruous woman: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And hath not wronged any man: but hath restored the pledge to the debtor, hath taken nothing away by violence: hath given his bread to the hungry, and hath covered the naked with a garment: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> Hath not lent upon usury, nor taken any increase: hath withdrawn his hand from iniquity, and hath executed true judgment between man and man: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> Hath walked in my commandments, and kept my judgments, to do truth: he is just, he shall surely live, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And if he beget a son that is a robber, a shedder of blood, and that hath done some one of these things: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> Though he doth not all these things, but that eateth upon the mountains, and that defileth his neighbour's wife: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> That grieveth the needy and the poor, that taketh away by violence, that restoreth not the pledge, and that lifteth up his eyes to idols, that committeth abomination: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> That giveth upon usury, and that taketh an increase: shall such a one live? he shall not live. Seeing he hath done all these detestable things, he shall surely die, his blood shall be upon him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> But if he beget a son, who, seeing all his father's sine, which he hath done, is afraid, and shall not do the like to them : </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> That hath not eaten upon the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, and hath not defiled his neighbour's wife: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> And hath not grieved any man, nor withholden the pledge, nor taken away with violence, but hath given his bread to the hungry, and covered the naked with a garment: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> That hath turned away his hand from injuring the poor, hath not taken usury and increase, but hath executed my judgments, and hath walked in my commandments: this man shall not die for the iniquity of his father, but living he shall live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> As for his father, because he oppressed and offered violence to his brother, and wrought evil in the midst of his people, behold he is dead in his own iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> And you say: Why hath not the son borne the iniquity of his father? Verily, because the son hath wrought judgment and justice, hath kept all my commandments, and done them, living, he shall live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> The soul that sinneth, the same shall die: the son shall not bear the iniquity of the father, and the father shall not bear the iniquity of the son: the justice of the just shall be upon him, and the wickedness of the wicked shall be upon him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> But if the wicked do penance for all his sins which he hath committed, and keep all my commandments, and do judgment, and justice, living he shall live, and shall not die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> I will not remember all his iniquities that he hath done: in his justice which he hath wrought, he shall live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> Is it my will that a sinner should die, saith the Lord God, and not that he should be converted from his ways, and live? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> But if the just man turn himself away from his justice, and do iniquity according to all the abominations which the wicked man useth to work, shall he live? all his justices which he hath done, shall not be remembered: in the prevarication, by which he hath prevaricated, and in his sin, which he hath committed, in them he shall die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> And you have said: The way of the Lord is not right. Hear ye, therefore, O house of Israel: Is it my way that is not right, and are not rather your ways perverse? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> For when the just turneth himself away from his justice, and committeth iniquity, he shall die therein: in the injustice that he hath wrought he shall die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> And when the wicked turneth himself away from his wickedness, which he hath wrought, and doeth judgment, and justice: he shall save his soul alive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> Because he considereth and turneth away himself from all his iniquities which he hath wrought, he shall surely live, and not die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:29">18:29</a> And the children of Israel say: The way of the Lord is not right. Are not my ways right, O house of Israel, and are not rather your ways perverse? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:30">18:30</a> Therefore will I judge every man according to his ways, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God. Be converted, and do penance for all your iniquities: and iniquity shall not be your ruin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:31">18:31</a> Cast away from you all your transgressions, by which you have transgressed, and make to yourselves a new heart, and a new spirit: and why will you die, O house of Israel? </p>

 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> Moreover take thou up a lamentation for the princes of Israel, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> And say: Why did thy mother the lioness lie down among the lions, and bring up her whelps in the midst of young lions? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And she brought out one of her whelps, and he became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And the nations heard of him, and took him, but not without receiving wounds: and they brought him in chains into the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> But she seeing herself weakened, and that her hope was lost, took one of her young lions, and set him up for a lion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And he went up and down among the lions, and became a lion: and he learned to catch the prey, and to devour men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> He learned to make widows, and to lay waste their cities: and the land became desolate, and the fulness thereof by the noise of his roaring. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And the nations Game together against him on every side out of the provinces, and they spread their net over him, in their wounds he was taken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And they put him into a cage, they brought him in chains to the king of Babylon: and they cast him into prison, that his voice should no more be heard upon the mountains of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> Thy mother is like a vine in thy blood planted by the water: her fruit and her branches have grown out of many waters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And she hath strong rods to make sceptres for them that bear rule, and her stature was exalted among the branches: and she saw her height in the multitude of her branches. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> But she was plucked up in wrath, and cast on the ground, and the burning wind dried up her fruit: her strong rods are withered, and dried up: the fire hath devoured her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> And now she is transplanted into the desert, in a land not passable, and dry. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And a fire is gone out from a rod of her branches, which hath devoured her fruit: so that she now hath no strong rod, to be a sceptre of rulers. This is a lamentation, and it shall be for a lamentation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And it came to pass in the seventh year, in the fifth month, the tenth day of the month: there came men of the ancients of Israel to inquire of the Lord, and they sat before me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> Son of man, speak to the ancients of Israel, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Are you come to inquire of me? As I live, I will not answer you, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> If thou judgest them, if thou judgest, son of man, declare to them the abominations of their fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> And say to them: Thus saith the Lord God : In the day when I chose Israel, and lifted up my hand for the race of the house of Jacob: and appeared to them in the land of Egypt, and lifted up my hand for them, saying: I am the Lord your God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> In that day I lifted up my hand for them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt, into a land which I had provided for them, flowing with milk and honey, which excelleth amongst all lands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And I said to them: Let every man cast away the scandals of his eyes, and defile not yourselves with the idols of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> But they provoked me, and would not hearken to me: they did not every man cast away the abominations of his eyes, neither did they forsake the idols of Egypt: and I said I would pour out my indignation upon them, and accomplish my wrath against them in the midst of the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> But I did otherwise for my name's sake, that it might not be violated before the nations, in the midst of whom they were, and among whom I made myself known to them, to bring them out of the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> Therefore I brought them out from the land of Egypt, and brought them into the desert. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And I gave them my statutes, and I shewed them my judgments, which if a man do, he shall live in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> Moreover I gave them also my sabbaths, to be a sign between me and them: and that they might know that I am the Lord that sanctify them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> But the house of Israel provoked me in the desert: they walked not in my statutes, and they cast away my judgments, which if a man do he shall live in them: and they grievously violated my sabbaths. I said therefore that I would pour out my indignation upon them in the desert, and would consume them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> But I spared them for the sake of my name, lest it should be profaned before the nations, from which I brought them out, in their sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> So I lifted up my hand over them in the desert, not to bring them into the land which I had given them flowing with milk and honey, the best of all lands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> Because they cast off my judgments, and walked not in my statutes, and violated my sabbaths: for their heart went after idols. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> Yet my eye spared them, so that I destroyed them not: neither did I consume them in the desert. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> And I said to their children in the wilderness: Walk not in the statutes of your fathers, and observe not their judgments, nor be ye defiled with their idols: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> I am the Lord your God: walk ye in my statutes, and observe my judgments, and do them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> And sanctify my sabbaths, that they may be a sign between me and you: and that you may know that I am the Lord your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> But their children provoked me, they walked not in my commandments, nor observed my judgments to do them: which if a man do, he shell live in them: and they violated my sabbaths: and I threatened to pour out my indignation upon them, and to accomplish my wrath in them in the desert. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> But I turned away my hand, and wrought for my name's sake, that it might not be violated before the nations, out of which I brought them forth in their sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> Again I lifted up my hand upon them in the wilderness, to disperse them among the nations, and scatter them through the countries : </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> Because they had not done my judgments, and had cast off my statutes, and had violated my sabbaths, and their eyes had been after the idols of their fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> Therefore I also gave them statutes that were not good, and judgments, in which they shall not live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> And I polluted them in their own gifts, when they offered all that opened the womb, for their offences: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> Wherefore speak to the house of Israel, O son of man, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Moreover in this also your fathers blasphemed me, when they had despised and contemned me; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> And I had brought them into the land, for which I lifted up my hand to give it them: they saw every high hill, and every shady tree, and there they sacrificed their victims: and there they presented the provocation of their offerings, and there they set their sweet odours, and poured forth their libations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> And I said to them: What meaneth the high place to which you go? and the name thereof was called High-place even to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:30">20:30</a> Wherefore say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Verily, you are defiled in the way of your fathers, and you commit fornication with their abominations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:31">20:31</a> And you defile yourselves with all your: idols unto this day, in the offering of your gifts, when you make your children pass through the fire: and shall I answer you, O house of Israel? As I live, saith the Lord God, I will not answer you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:32">20:32</a> Neither shall the thought of your mind come to pass, by which you say: We will be as the Gentiles, and as the families of the earth, to worship stocks and stones. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:33">20:33</a> As I live, saith the Lord God, I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:34">20:34</a> And I will bring you out from the people, and I will gather you out of the countries, in which you are scattered, I will reign over you with a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm, and with fury poured out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:35">20:35</a> And I will bring you into the wilderness of people, and there will I plead with you face to face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:36">20:36</a> As I pleaded against your fathers in the desert of the land of Egypt; even so will I judge you, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:37">20:37</a> And I will make you subject to my sceptre, and will bring you into the bands of the covenant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:38">20:38</a> And I will pick out from among you the transgressors, and the wicked, and will bring them out of the land where they sojourn, and they shall not enter into the land of Israel: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:39">20:39</a> And as for you, O house of Israel: thus saith the Lord God: Walk ye every one after your idols, and serve them. But if in this also you hear me not, but defile my holy name any more with your gifts, and with your idols; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:40">20:40</a> In my holy mountain, in the high mountain of Israel, saith the Lord God, there shall all the house of Israel serve me; all of them I say, in the land in which they shall please me, and there will I require your firstfruits, and the chief of your tithes with all your sanctifications. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:41">20:41</a> I will accept of you for an odour of sweetness, when I shall have brought you out from the people, and shall have gathered you out of the lands into which you are scattered, and I will be sanctified in you in the sight of the nations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:42">20:42</a> And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have brought you into the land of Israel, into the land for which I lifted up my hand to give it to your fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:43">20:43</a> And there you shall remember your ways, and all your wicked doings with which you have been defiled; and you shall be displeased with yourselves in your own sight, for all your wicked deeds which you committed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:44">20:44</a> And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have done well by you for my own name's sake, and not according to your evil ways, nor according to your wicked deeds, O house of Israel, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:45">20:45</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying : </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:46">20:46</a> Son of man, set thy face against the way of the south, and drop towards the south, and prophesy against the forest of the south field. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:47">20:47</a> And any to the south forest: Hear the word of the Lord: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will kindle a fire in thee, and will burn in thee every green tree, and every dry tree: the dame of the fire shall not be quenched: and every face shall be burned in it, from the south even to the north. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:48">20:48</a> And all flesh shall see, that I the Lord have kindled it, and it shall not be quenched. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:49">20:49</a> And I said: Ah, ah, ah, O Lord God: they say of me: Doth not this man speak by parables? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> Son of man, set thy face toward Jerusalem, and let thy speech flow towards the holy places, and prophesy against the land of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And say to the land of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, and I will draw forth my sword out of its sheath, and will cut off in thee the just, and the wicked. </p>

 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> That all flesh may know that I the Lord have drawn my sword out of its sheath not to be turned back. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And thou, son of man, mourn with the breaking of thy loins, and with bitterness sigh before them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And when they shall say to thee: Why mournest thou? thou shalt say: For that which I hear: because it cometh, and every heart shall melt, and all hands shall be made feeble, and every spirit shall faint, and water shall run down every knee: behold it cometh, and it shall be done, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> Son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Say: The sword, the sword is sharpened, and furbished. </p>

 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And I have given it to be furbished, that it may be handled: this sword is sharpened, and it is furbished, that it may be in the hand of the slayer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> Cry, and howl, 0 son of man, for this sword is upon my people, it is upon all the princes of Israel, that are fled: they are delivered up to the sword with my people, strike therefore upon thy thigh, </p>

 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And thou son of man, set thee two ways, for the sword of the king of Babylon to come: both shall come forth out of one land: and with his hand he shall draw lots, he shall consult at the head of the way of the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> Thou shalt make a way that the sword may come to Rabbath of the children of Ammon, and to Juda unto Jerusalem the strong city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> For the king of Babylon stood in the highway, at the head of two ways, seeking divination, shuffling arrows: he inquired of the idols, and consulted entrails. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> On his right hand was the divination for Jerusalem, to set battering rams, to open the mouth in slaughter, to lift up the voice in howling, to set engines against the gates, to cast up a mount, to build forts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> And he shall be in their eyes as one consulting the oracle in vain, and imitating the leisure of sabbaths: but he will call to remembrance the iniquity that they may be taken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you have remembered your iniquity, and have discovered your prevarications, and your sins have appeared in all your devices: because, I say, you have remembered, you shall be taken with the hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> But thou profane wicked prince of Israel, whose day is come that hath been appointed in the time of iniquity: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Remove the diadem, take off the crown: is it not this that hath exalted the low one, and brought down him that was high? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> I will shew it to be iniquity, iniquity, iniquity: but this was not done till he came to whom judgment belongeth, and I will give it him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> And thou son of man, prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God concerning the children of Ammon, and concerning their reproach, and thou shalt say: sword, O sword, come out of the scabbard to kill, be furbished to destroy, and to glitter, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> Whilst they see vain things in thy regard, and they divine lies: to bring thee upon the necks of the wicked that are wounded, whose appointed day is come in the time of iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> Return into thy sheath. I will judge thee in the place wherein thou wast created, in the land of thy nativity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:31">21:31</a> And I will pour out upon thee my indignation: in the fire of my rage will I blow upon thee, and will give thee into the hands of men that are brutish and contrive thy destruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:32">21:32</a> Thou shalt be fuel for the fire, thy blood shall be in the midst of the land, thou shalt be forgotten: for I the Lord have spoken it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And thou son of man, dost thou not judge, dost thou not judge the city of blood? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> And thou shalt shew her all her abominations, and shalt say: Thus saith the Lord God: This is the city that sheddeth blood in the midst of her, that her time may come: and that hath made idols against herself, to defile herself. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> Thou art become guilty in thy blood which thou hast shed: and thou art defiled in thy idols which thou hast made: and thou hast made thy days to draw near, and hast brought on the time of thy years: therefore have I made thee a reproach to the Gentiles, and a mockery to all countries. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> Those that are near, and those that are far from thee, shall triumph over thee: thou filthy one, infamous, great in destruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> Behold the princes of Israel, every one hath employed his arm in thee to shed blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> They have abused father and mother in thee, they have oppressed the stranger in the midst of thee, they have grieved the fatherless and widow in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> Thou hast despised my sanctuaries, and profaned my sabbaths. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> Slanderers have been in thee to shed blood, and they have eaten upon the mountains in thee, they have committed wickedness in the midst of thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> They have discovered the nakedness of their father in thee, they have humbled the uncleanness of the menstruous woman in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And every one hath committed abomination with his neighbour's wife, and the father in law hath wickedly defiled his daughter in law, the brother hath oppressed his sister the daughter of his father in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> They have taken gifts in thee to shed blood: thou hast taken usury and increase, and hast covetously oppressed thy neighbours: and then hast forgotten me, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> Behold, I have clapped my hands at thy covetousness, which thou hast exercised and at the blood that hath been shed: In the midst of thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> Shall thy heart endure, or shall thy hands prevail ill the days which I will bring upon thee: I the Lord have spoken, and will do it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> And I will disperse thee in the nations, and will scatter thee among the countries, and I will put an end to thy uncleanness in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> And I will possess thee in the sight of the Gentiles, and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> Son of man, the house of Israel is become dress to me: all these are brass, and tin, and iron, and lead, in the midst of the furnace: they are become the dress of silver. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because you are all turned into dress, therefore behold I will gather you together in the midst of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> As they gather silver, and brass, and tin, and iron, and lead in the midst of the furnace: that I may kindle a fire in it to melt it: so will I gather you together in my fury and in my wrath, and will take my rest, and I will melt you down. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> And I will gather you together, and will burn you in the fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> As silver is melted in the midst of the furnace, so shall you be in the midst thereof: and you shall know that I am the Lord, when I have poured out my indignation upon you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> Son of man, say to her: Thou art a land that is unclean, and not rained upon in the day of wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> There is a conspiracy of prophets in the midst thereof: like a lion that roareth and catcheth the prey, they have devoured souls, they have taken riches and hire, they have made many widows in the midst thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> Her priests have despised my law, and have defiled my sanctuaries: they have put no difference between holy and profane: nor have distinguished between the polluted and the clean: and they have turned away their eyes from my sabbaths, and I was profaned in the midst of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> Her princes in the midst of her, are like wolves ravening the prey to shed blood, and to destroy souls, and to run after gains through covetousness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> And her prophets have daubed them without tempering the mortar, seeing vain things, and divining lies unto them, saying: Thus saith the Lord God: when the Lord hath not spoken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> The people of the land have used oppression, and committed robbery: they afflicted the needy and poor, and they oppressed the stranger by calumny without judgment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> And I sought among them for a man that might set up a hedge, and stand in the gap before me in favour of the land, that I might not destroy it: and I found none. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> And I poured out my indignation upon them, in the fire of my wrath I consumed them: I have rendered their way upon their own head, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: Son of man, there were two women, daughters of one mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And they committed fornication in Egypt, in their youth they committed fornication: there were their breasts pressed down, and the teats of their virginity were bruised. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And their names were Oolla the elder, and Ooliba her younger sister: and I took them, and they bore sons and daughters. Now for their names, Samaria is Oolla, and Jerusalem is Ooliba. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> And Oolla committed fornication against me, and doted on her lovers, on the Assyrians that came to her, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> Who were clothed with blue, princes, and rulers, beautiful youths, all horsemen, mounted upon horses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And she committed her fornications with those chosen men, all sons of the Assyrians: and she defiled herself with the uncleanness of all them on whom she doted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> Moreover also she did not forsake her fornications which she had committed in Egypt: for they also lay with her in her youth, and they bruised the breasts of her virginity, and poured out their fornication upon her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> Therefore have I delivered her into the hands of her lovers, into the hands of the sons of the Assyrians, upon whose lust she doted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> They discovered her disgrace, took away her sons and daughters, and slew her with the sword: and they became infamous women, and they executed judgments in her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> And when her sister Ooliba saw this, she was mad with lust more than she: and she carried her fornication beyond the fornication of her sister. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> Impudently prostituting herself to the children of the Assyrians, the princes, and rulers that came to her, clothed with divers colours, to the horsemen that rode upon horses, and to young men all of great beauty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> And I saw that she was defiled, and that they both took one way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And she increased her fornications: and when she had seen men painted on the wall, the images of the Chaldeans set forth in colours, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> And girded with girdles about their reins, and with dyed turbans on their heads, the resemblance of all the captains, the likeness of the sons of Babylon, and of the land of the Chaldeans wherein they were born, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> She doted upon them with the lust of her eyes, and she sent messengers to them into Chaldea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> And when the sons of Babylon were come to her to the bed of love, they defiled her with their fornications, and she was polluted by them, and her soul was glutted with them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> And she discovered her fornications, and discovered her disgrace: and my soul was alienated from her, as my soul was alienated from her sister. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> For she multiplied her fornications, remembering the days of her youth, in which she played the harlot in the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> And she was mad with lust after lying with them whose flesh is as the flesh of asses: and whose issue as the issue of horses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> And thou hast renewed the wickedness of thy youth, when thy breasts were pressed in Egypt, and the papa of thy virginity broken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:22">23:22</a> Therefore, Ooliba, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will raise up against thee all thy lovers with whom thy soul hath been glutted: and I will gather them together against thee round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> The children of Babylon, and all the Chaldeans, the nobles, and the kings, and princes, all the sons of the Assyrians, beautiful young men, all the captains, and rulers, the princes of princes, and the renowned horsemen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> And they shall come upon thee well appointed with chariot and wheel, a multitude of people: they shall be armed against thee on every side with breastplate, and buckler, and helmet: and I will set judgment before them, and they shall judge thee by their judgments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> And I will set my jealousy against thee, which they shall execute upon thee with fury: they shall cut off thy nose and thy ears: and what remains shall fall by the sword: they shall take thy sons, and thy daughters, and thy residue shall be devoured by fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> And they shall strip thee of thy garments, and take away the instruments of thy glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> And I will put an end to thy wickedness in thee, and thy fornication brought out of the land of Egypt: neither shalt thou lift up thy eyes to them, nor remember Egypt any more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> For thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will deliver thee into the hands of them whom thou hatest, into their hands with whom thy soul hath been glutted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> And they shall deal with thee in hatred, and they shall take away all thy labours, and shall let thee go naked, and full of disgrace, and the disgrace of thy fornication shall be discovered, thy wickedness, and thy fornications. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:30">23:30</a> They have done these things to thee, because thou hast played the harlot with the nations among which thou wast defiled with their idols. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:31">23:31</a> Thou hast walked in the way of thy sister, and I will give her cup into thy hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:32">23:32</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Thou shalt drink thy sister's cup, deep, and wide: thou shalt be had in derision and scorn, which containeth very much. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:33">23:33</a> Thou shalt be filled with drunkenness, and sorrow: with the cup of grief, and sadness, with the cup of thy sister Samaria. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:34">23:34</a> And thou shalt drink it, and shalt drink it up even to the dregs, and thou shalt devour the fragments thereof, thou shalt rend thy breasts: because I have spoken it, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:35">23:35</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast forgotten me, and hast cast me off behind thy back, bear thou also thy wickedness, and thy fornications. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:36">23:36</a> And the Lord spoke to me, saying: Son of man, dost thou judge Oolla, and Ooliba, and dost thou declare to them their wicked deeds? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:37">23:37</a> Because they have committed adultery, and blood is in their hands, and they have committed fornication with their idols: moreover also their children, whom they bore to me, they have offered to them to be devoured. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:38">23:38</a> Yea, and they have done this to me. They polluted my sanctuary on the same day, and profaned my sabbaths. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:39">23:39</a> And when they sacrificed their children to their idols, and went into my sanctuary the same day to profane it: they did these things even in the midst of my house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:40">23:40</a> They sent for men coming from afar, to whom they had sent a messenger: and behold they came: for whom thou didst wash thyself, and didst paint thy eyes, and wast adorned with women's ornaments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:41">23:41</a> Thou sattest on a very fine bed, and a table was decked before thee: whereupon thou didst set my incense, and my ointment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:42">23:42</a> And there was in her the voice of a multitude rejoicing: and to some that were brought of the multitude of men, and that came from the desert, they put bracelets on their hands, and beautiful crowns on their heads. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:43">23:43</a> And I said to her that was worn out in her adulteries: Now will this woman still continue in her fornication. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:44">23:44</a> And they went in to her, as to a harlot: so went they in unto Oolla, and Ooliba, wicked women. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:45">23:45</a> They therefore are k just men: these shall judge them as adulteresses are judged, and as shedders of blood are judged: because they are adulteresses, and blood is in their hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:46">23:46</a> For thus saith the Lord God: Bring a multitude upon them, and deliver them over to tumult and rapine: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:47">23:47</a> And lee the people stone them with stones, and let them be stabbed with their swords: they shall kill their sons and daughters, and their houses they shall burn with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:48">23:48</a> And I will take away wickedness out of the land: and all women shall learn, not to do according to the wickedness of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:49">23:49</a> And they shall render your wickedness upon you, and you shall bear the sins of your idols: and you shall know that I am the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me in the ninth year, in the tenth month, the tenth day of the month, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> Son of man, write thee the name of this day, on which the king of Babylon hath set himself against Jerusalem to day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> And thou shalt speak by a figure a parable to the provoking house, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Set on a pot, set it on, I say, and put water into it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> Heap together into if the pieces thereof, every good piece, the thigh and the shoulder, choice pieces and full of bones. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> Take the fattest of the flock, and lay together piles of bones under it: the seething thereof is boiling hot, and the bones thereof are thoroughly sodden in the midst of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city, to the pot whose rust is in it, and its rust is not gone out of it: cast it out piece by piece, there hath no lot fallen upon it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> For her blood is in the midst of her, she hath shed it upon the smooth rock: she hath not shed it upon the ground, that it might be covered with dust. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> And that I might bring my indignation upon her, and take my vengeance: I have shed her blood upon the smooth rock, that it should not be covered. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the bloody city, of which I will make a great bonfire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> Heap together the bones, which I will burn with Are: the flesh shall be consumed, and the whole composition shall be sodden, and the bones shall be consumed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> Then set it empty upon burning coals, that it may be hot, and the brass thereof may be melted: and let the filth of it be melted in the midst thereof, and let the rust of it be consumed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> Great pains have been taken, and the great rust thereof is not gone out, not even by fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> Thy uncleanness is execrable: be- cause I desired to cleanse thee, and thou art not cleansed from thy filthiness: neither shalt thou be cleansed, before I cause my indignation to rest in thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> I the Lord have spoken: it shall come to pass, and I will do it: I will not pass by, nor spare, nor be pacified: I will judge thee according to thy ways, and according to thy doings, saith the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> Son of man, behold I take from thee the desire of thy eyes with a stroke: and thou shalt not lament, nor weep : neither shall thy tears run down. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> Sigh in silence, make no mourning for the dead: let the tire of thy head be upon thee, and thy shoes on thy feet, and cover not thy face, nor eat the meat of mourners. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died in the evening: and I did in the morning as he had commanded me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> And the people said to me: Why dost thou not tell us what these things mean that thou doest? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> And I said to them: The word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> Speak to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will profane my sanctuary, the glory of your realm, and the thing that your eyes de sire, and for which your soul feareth: your sons, and your daughters, whom you have left, shall fall by the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And you shall do as I have done: you shall not cover your faces, nor shall you eat the meat of mourners. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> You shall have crowns on your heads, and shoes on your feet: you shall not lament nor weep, but you shall pine away for your iniquities, and every one shall sigh with his brother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And Ezechiel shall be unto you for a sign of things to come: according to all that he hath done, so shall you do, when this shall come to pass: and you shall know that I am the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> And thou, O son of man, behold in the day wherein I will take away from them their strength, and the joy of their glory, and the desire of their eyes, upon which their souls rest, their sons and their daughters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:26">24:26</a> In that day when he that escapeth shall come to thee, to tell thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:27">24:27</a> In that day, I say, shall thy mouth be opened to him that hath escaped, and thou shalt speak, and shalt be silent no more: and thou shalt be unto them for a sign of things to come, and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> Son of man, set thy face against the children of Ammon, and thou shalt prophesy of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> And thou shalt say to the children of Ammon: Hear ye the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast said: Ha, ha, upon my sanctuary, because it was profaned: and upon the land of Israel, because it was laid waste: and upon the house of Juda, because they are led into captivity: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> Therefore will I deliver thee to the men of the east for an inheritance, and they shall place their sheepcotes in thee, and shall set up their tents in thee: they shall eat thy fruits: and they shall drink thy milk. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> And I will make Rabbath a stable for camels, and the children of Ammon a couching place for flocks: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> For thus saith the Lord God: Because thou hast clapped thy hands and stamped with thy foot, and hast rejoiced with all thy heart against the land of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> Therefore behold I: will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and will deliver thee to be the spoil of nations, and will cut thee off from among the people, and destroy thee out of the lands, and break thee in pieces: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Because Moab and Seir have said: Behold the house of Juda is like all other nations: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> Therefore behold I will open the shoulder of Moab from the cities, from his cities, I say, and his borders, the noble cities of the land of Bethiesimoth, and Beelmeon, and Cariathaim, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> To the people of the east with the children of Ammon, and I will give it them for an inheritance: that there may be no more any remembrance of the children of Ammon among the nations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> And I will execute judgments in Moab: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p>

 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> And I will pour out my indignation upon Pelusium the strength of Egypt, and will cut off the multitude of Alexandria. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> And I will make a fire in Egypt: Pelusium shall be in pain like a woman in labour, and Alexandria shall be laid waste, and in Memphis there shall be daily distresses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> The young men of Heliopolis, and of Bubastus shall fall by the sword, and they themselves shall go into captivity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> And in Taphnis the day shall be darkened, when I shall break there the sceptres of Egypt, and the pride of her power shall cease in her: a cloud shall cover her, and her daughters shall be led into captivity. </p>

 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, in the first month, in the seventh day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharao king of Egypt: and behold it is not bound up, to be healed, to be tied up with clothes, and swathed with linen, that it might recover strength, and hold the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against Pharao king of Egypt, and I will break into pieces his strong arm, which is already broken: and I will cause the sword to fall out of his hand: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> And I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and scatter them through the countries. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and will put my sword in his hand: and I will break the arms of Pharao, and they shall groan bitterly being slain before his face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:25">30:25</a> And I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, and the arms of Pharao shall fall: and they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have given my sword into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall have stretched it forth upon the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:26">30:26</a> And I will disperse Egypt among the nations, and will scatter them through the countries, and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> And it came to pass in the eleventh year, the third month, the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> Son of man, speak to Pharao king of Egypt, and to his people: To whom art thou like in thy greatness? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> Behold, the Assyrian was like a cedar in Libanus, with fair branches, and full of leaves, of a high stature, and his top was elevated among the thick boughs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> The waters nourished him, the deep set him up on high, the streams thereof ran round about his roots, and it sent forth its rivulets to all the trees of the country. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> Therefore was his height exalted above all the trees of the country: and his branches were multiplied, and his boughs were elevated because of many waters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> And when he had spread forth his shadow, all the fowls of the air made their nests in his boughs, and all the beasts of the forest brought forth their young under his branches, and the assembly of many nations dwelt under his shadow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> And he was most beautiful for his greatness, and for the spreading of his branches: for his root was near great waters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> The cedars in the paradise of God wars not higher than he, the fir trees did not equal his top, neither were the plane trees to be compared with him for branches: no tree in the paradise of God was like him in his beauty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> For I made him beautiful and thick set with many branches: and all the trees of pleasure, that were in the paradise of God, envied him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God Because he was exalted in height, and shot up his top green and thick, and his heart was lifted up in his height: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> I have delivered him into the hands of the mighty one of the nations, he shall deal with him: I have cast him out according to his wickedness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> And strangers, and the most cruel of the nations shall cut him down, and cast him away upon the mountains, and his boughs shall fall in every valley, and his branches shall be broken on every rock of the country: and all the people of the earth shall depart from his shadow, and leave him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> All the fowls of the air dwelt upon his ruins, and all the beasts of the field were among his branches. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> For which cause none of the trees by the waters shall exalt themselves for their height: nor shoot up their tops among the thick branches and leaves, neither shall any of them that are watered stand up in their height: for they are all delivered unto death to the lowest parts of the earth, in the midst of the children of men, with them that go down into the pit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> Thus saith the Lord God: In the day when he went down to hell, I brought in mourning, I covered him with the deep: and I withheld its rivers, and restrained the many waters: Libanus grieved for him, and all the trees of the field trembled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> I shook the nations with the sound of his fall, when I brought him down to hell with them that descend into the pit: and all the trees of pleasure, the choice and best in Libanus, all that were moistened with waters, were comforted in the lowest parts of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> For they also shall go down with him to hell to them that are slain by the sword: and the arm of every one shall sit down under his shadow in the midst of the nations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> To whom art thou like, O thou that art famous and lofty among the trees of pleasure? Behold, thou art brought down with the trees of pleasure to the lowest parts of the earth: thou shalt sleep in the midst of the uncircumcised, with them that are slain by the sword: this is Pharao, and all his multitude, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the twelfth month, in the first day of the month, that the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> Son of man, take up a lamentation for Pharao the king of Egypt, and say to him: Thou art like the lion of the nations, and the dragon that is in the sea: and thou didst push with the horn in thy rivers, and didst trouble the waters with thy feet, and didst trample upon their streams. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> Therefore, thus saith the Lord God: I will spread out my net over thee with the multitude of many people, and I will draw thee up in my net. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> And I will throw thee out on the land, I will cast thee away into the open field: and I will cause all the fowls of the air to dwell upon thee, and I will fill the beasts of all the earth with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> And I will lay thy flesh upon the mountains, and will fill thy hills with thy corruption, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> And I will water the earth with thy stinking blood upon the mountains, and the valleys shall be filled with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> And I will cover the heavens, when thou shalt be put out, and I will make the stars thereof dark: I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon shall not give her light. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> I will make all the lights of heaven to mourn over thee: and I will cause darkness upon thy land, saith the Lord God, when thy wounded shall fall in the midst of the land, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> And I shall provoke to anger the heart of many people, when I shall have brought in thy destruction among the nations upon the lands, which thou knowest not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> And I will make many people to be amazed at thee, and their kings shell be horribly afraid for thee, when my sword shall begin to fly upon their faces: and they shall be astonished on a sudden, every one for his own life, in the day of their ruin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> For thus saith the Lord God: The sword of the king of Babylon shall come upon thee, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> By the swords of the mighty I will overthrow thy multitude: all these nations are invincible: and they shall waste the pride of Egypt, and the multitude thereof shall be destroyed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> I will destroy also all the beasts thereof that were beside the great waters: and the foot of man shall trouble them no more, neither shall the hoof of beasts trouble them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> Then will I make their waters clear, and cause their rivers to run like oil, saith the Lord God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> When I shall have made the land of Egypt desolate: and the land shall be destitute of her fulness, when I shall have struck all the inhabitants thereof: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> This is the lamentation, and they shall lament therewith: the daughters of the nations shall lament therewith: for Egypt, and for the multitude thereof they shall lament therewith, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> And it came to pass in the twelfth year, in the fifteenth day of the month that the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> Son of man, sing a mournful song for the multitude of Egypt: and cast her down, both her, and the daughters of the mighty nations to the lowest part of the earth, with them that go down into the pit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> Whom dost thou excel in beauty? go down and sleep with the uncircumcised. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> They shall fall in the midst of them that are slain with the sword : the sword is given, they have drawn her down, and all her people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> The most mighty among the strong ones shall speak to him from the midst of hell, they that went down with his helpers, and slept uncircumcised, slain by the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> Assur is there, and all his multitude: their graves are round about him, all of them slain, and that fell by the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> Whose graves are set in the lowest parts of the pit: and his multitude lay round about his grave: all of them slain, and fallen by the sword, they that heretofore spread terror in the land of the living. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> There is Elam and all his multitude round about his grave, all of them slain, and fallen by the sword; that went down uncircumcised to the lowest parts of the earth: that caused their terror in the land of the living, and they have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> In the midst of the slain they have set him a bed among all his people: their graves are round about him: all these are uncircumcised, and slain by the sword: for they spread their terror in the land of the living, and have borne their shame with them that descend into the pit: they are laid in the midst of the slain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> There is Mosoch, and Thubal, and all their multitude: their graves are round about him: all of them uncircumcised and slain, and fallen by the sword: though they spread their terror in the land of the living. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> And they shall not sleep with the brave, and with them that fell uncircumcised, that went down to hell with their weapons, and laid their swords under their heads, and their iniquities were in their bones, because they were the terror of the mighty in the land of the living. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> So thou also shalt be broken in the midst of the uncircumcised, and shalt sleep with them that are slain by the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> There is Edom, and her kings, and all her princes, who with their army are joined with them that are slain by the sword: and have slept with the uncircumcised, and with them that go down into the pit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> There are all the princes of the north, and all the hunters: who were brought down with the slain, fearing, and con- founded in their strength: who slept uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword, and have borne their shame with them that go down into the pit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> Pharao saw them, and he was comforted concerning all his multitude, which was slain by the sword: Pharao, and all his army, saith the Lord God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> Because I have spread my terror in the land of the living, and he hath slept in the midst of the uncircumcised with them that are slain by the sword: Pharao and all his multitude, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> Son of man, speak to the children of thy people, and say to them: When I bring the sword upon a land, if the people of the land take a man, one of their meanest, and make him a watchman over them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> And he see the sword coming upon the land, and sound the trumpet, and tell the people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> Then he that heareth the sound of the trumpet, whosoever he be, and doth not look to himself, if the sword come, and cut him off: his blood shall be upon his own head. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> He heard the sound of the trumpet and did not look to himself, his blood shall be upon him: but if he look to himself, he shall save his life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> And if the watchman see the sword coming, and sound not the trumpet: and the people look not to themselves, and the sword come, and cut off a soul from among them: he indeed is taken away in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at the hand of the watchman. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> So thou, O son of man, I have made thee a watchman to the house of Israel: therefore thou shalt hear the word from my mouth, and shalt tell it them from me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> When I say to the wicked: O wicked man, thou shalt surely die: if thou dost not speak to warn the wicked man from his way: that wicked man shall die in his iniquity, but I will require his blood at thy hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> But if thou tell the wicked man, that he may be converted from his ways, and he be not converted from his way: he shall die in his iniquity: but thou hast delivered thy soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the house of Israel: Thus you have spoken, saying: Our iniquities, and our sins are upon us, and we pine away in them: how then can we live? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> Say to them: As I live, saith the Lord God, I desire not the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live. Turn ye, turn ye from your evil ways: and why will you die, O house of Israel? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> Thou therefore, O son of man, say to the children of thy people: The justice of the just shall not deliver him, in what day soever he shall sin: and the wickedness of the wicked shall not hurt him, in what day soever he shall turn from his wickedness: and the just shall not be able to live in his justice, in what day soever he shall sin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> Yea, if I shall say to the just that he shall surely live, and he, trusting in his justice, commit iniquity: all his justices shall be forgotten, and in his iniquity, which he hath committed, in the same shall he die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> And if I shall say to the wicked: Thou shalt surely die: and he do penance for his sin, and do judgment and justice, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> And if that wicked man restore the pledge, and render what he had robbed, and walk in the commandments of life, and do no unjust thing: he shall surely live, and shall not die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> None of his sins, which he hath committed, shall be imputed to him: he hath done judgment and justice, he shall surely live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> And the children of thy people have said: The way of the Lord is not equitable: whereas their own way is unjust. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> For when the just shall depart from his justice, and commit iniquities, he shall die in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> And when the wicked shall depart from his wickedness, and shall do judgments, and justice: be shall live in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> And you say: The way of the Lord is not right, I will judge every one of you according to his ways, O house of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> And it came to pass in the twelfth year of our captivity, in the tenth month, in the fifth day of the month, that there came to me one that was fled from Jerusalem, saying: The city is laid waste. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> And the hand of the Lord had been upon me in the evening, before he that was fled came: and he opened my mouth till he came to me in the morning, and my mouth being opened, I was silent no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:24">33:24</a> Son of man, they that dwell in these ruinous places in the land of Israel, speak, saying: Abraham was one, and he inherited the land, but we are many, the land is given us in possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:25">33:25</a> Therefore say to them: Thus saith the Lord God, You that eat with the blood and lift up your eyes to your uncleannesses, and that shed blood: shall you possess the land by inheritance? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:26">33:26</a> You stood on your swords, you have committed abominations, and every one hath defiled his neighbour's wife; and shall you possess the land by inheritance? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:27">33:27</a> Say thou thus to them: Thus saith the Lord God: As I live, they that dwell in the ruinous places, shall fall by the sword: and he that is in the field, shall be given to the beasts to be devoured: and they that are in holds, and caves, shall die of the pestilence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:28">33:28</a> And I will make the land a wilderness, and a desert, and the proud strength thereof shall fail, and the mountains of Israel shall be desolate, because there is none to pass by them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:29">33:29</a> And they shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have made their land waste and desolate, for all their abominations which they have committed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:30">33:30</a> And thou son of man: the children of thy people, that talk of thee by the walls, and in the doors of the houses, and speak one to another each men to his neighbour, saying: Come, and let us hear what is the word that cometh forth from the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:31">33:31</a> And they come to thee, as if a people were coming in, and my people sit before thee: and hear thy words, and do them not: for they turn them into a song of their mouth, and their heart goeth after their covetousness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:32">33:32</a> And thou art to them as a musical song which is sung with a sweet and agreeable voice: and they hear thy words, and do them not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:33">33:33</a> And when that which was foretold shall come to pass, (for behold it is coming,) then shall they know that a prophet bath been among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> Son of man, prophesy concerning the shepherds of Israel: prophesy, and say to the shepherds: Thus saith the Lord God: Woe to the shepherds of Israel, that fed themselves: should not the hocks be fed by the shepherds? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> You ate the milk, end you clothed yourselves with the wool, and you killed that which was fat: but my flock you did not feed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> The weak you have not strengthened, and that which was sick you have not healed, that which was broken you have not bound up, and that which was driven away you have not brought again, neither have you sought that which was lost: but you ruled over them with rigour, and with a high hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> And my sheep were scattered, because there was no shepherd: and they became the prey of all the beasts of the field, and were scattered. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> My sheep have wandered in every mountain, and in every high hill: and my flocks mere scattered upon the face of the earth, and there was none that sought them, there was none, I say, that sought them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> As I live, saith the Lord God, forasmuch as my flocks have been made a spoil, and my sheep are become a prey to all the beasts of the field, because there was no shepherd: for my shepherds did not seek after my flock, but the shepherds fed themselves, and fed not my flocks: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> Therefore, ye shepherds, hear the word of the Lord: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I myself come upon the shepherds, I will require my hock at their hand, and I will cause them to cease from feeding the flock any more, neither shall the shepherds feed themselves any more: and I will deliver my flock from their mouth, and it shall no more be meat for them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> For thus saith the Lord God: Behold I myself will seek my sheep, and will visit them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> As the shepherd visiteth his hock in the day when he shall be in the midst of his sheep that were scattered, so will I visit my sheep, and will deliver them out of all the places where they have been scattered in the cloudy and dark day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> And I will bring them out from the peoples, and will gather them out of the countries, and will bring them to their own land: and I will feed them in the mountains of Israel, by the rivers, and in all the habitations of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> I will feed them in the most fruitful pastures, and their pastures shall be in the high mountains of Israel: there shall they rest on the green grass, and be fed in fat pastures upon the mountains of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> I will feed my sheep : and I will cause them to lie down, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:16">34:16</a> I will seek that which was lost: and that which was driven away, I will bring again: and I will bind up that which was broken, and I will strengthen that which was weak, and that which was fat and strong I will preserve: and I will feed them in judgment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> And as for you, O my flocks, thus saith the Lord God: Behold I judge between cattle and cattle, of rams and of he goats. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> Was it not enough for you to feed upon good pastures? but you must also tread down with your feet the residue of your pastures: and when you drank the dearest water, you troubled the rest with your feet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> And my sheep were fed with that which you had trodden with your feet: and they drank what your feet had troubled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God to you: Behold, I myself will judge between the fat cattle and the lean. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> Because you thrusted with sides and shoulders, and struck all the weak cattle with your horns, till they were scattered abroad: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:22">34:22</a> I will save my dock, and it shall be no more a spoil, and I will judge between cattle and cattle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:23">34:23</a> AND I WILL SET UP ONE SHEPHERD OVER THEM, and he shall feed them, even my servant David: he shall feed them, and he shall be their shepherd. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:24">34:24</a> And I the Lord will be their God: and my servant David the prince in the midst of them: I the Lord have spoken it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:25">34:25</a> And I will make a covenant of peace with them, and will cause the evil beasts to cease out of the land: and they that dwell in the wilderness shall sleep secure in the forests. </p>

 <p><a name="an_34:28">34:28</a> And they shall be no more for a spoil to the nations, neither shall the beasts of the earth devour them: but they shall dwell securely without any terror. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:29">34:29</a> And I will raise up for them a bud of renown: and they shall be no more consumed with famine in the land, neither shall they bear any more the reproach of the Gentiles. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:30">34:30</a> And they shall know that I the Lord their God am with them, and that they are my people the house of Israel: saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:31">34:31</a> And you my flocks, the flocks of my pasture are men: and I am the Lord your God, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> Son of man, set thy face against mount Seir, and prophesy concerning it, and say to it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I come against thee, mount Seir, and I will stretch forth my hand upon thee, and I will make thee desolate and waste. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> I will destroy thy cities, and thou shalt be desolate: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> Because thou hast been an everlasting enemy, and hast shut up the children of Israel in the hands of the sword in the time of their affliction, in the time of their last iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will deliver thee up to blood, and blood shall pursue thee: and whereas thou hast hated blood, blood shall pursue thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a> And I will make mount Seir waste and desolate: and I will take away from it him that goeth and him that returneth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> And I will fill his mountains with his men that are slain: in thy hills, and in thy valleys, and in thy torrents they shall fall that are slain with the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> I will make thee everlasting desolations, and thy cities shall not be inhabited: and thou shalt know that I am the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> Because thou hast said: The two nations, and the two lands shall be mine, and I will possess them by inheritance: whereas the Lord was there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a> Therefore as I live, saith the Lord God, I will do according to thy wrath, and according to thy envy, which thou hast exercised in hatred to them: and I will be made known by them, when I shall have judged thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> And thou shalt know that I the Lord have heard all thy reproaches, that thou hast spoken against the mountains of Israel, saying: They are desolate, they are given to us to consume. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> And you rose up against me with your mouth, and have derogated from me by your words: I have heard them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a> Thus saith the Lord God: When the whole earth shall rejoice, I will make thee a wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> As thou best rejoiced over the inheritance of the house of Israel, because it was laid waste, so will I do to thee: thou shalt be laid waste, O mount Seir, and all Idumea: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> And thou son of man, prophesy to the mountains of Israel, and say: Ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Because the enemy hath said of you: Aha, the everlasting heights are given to us for an inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> Therefore prophesy, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Because you have been desolate, and trodden under foot on every side, and made an inheritance to the rest of the nations, and are become the subject of the talk, and the reproach of the people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> Therefore, ye mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord God: Thus saith the Lord God to the mountains, and to the hills, to the brooks, and to the valleys, and to desolate places, and ruinous walls, and to the cities that are forsaken, that are spoiled, and derided by the rest of the nations round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: In the fire of my zeal I have spoken of the rest of the nations, and of all Edom, who have taken my land to themselves, for an inheritance with joy, and with all the heart, and with the mind: and have cast it out to lay it waste. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> Prophesy therefore concerning the land of Israel, and say to the mountains, and to the hills, to the ridges, and to the valleys: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I have spoken in my zeal, and in my indignation, because you have borne the shame of the Gentiles. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord God: I have lifted up my hand, that the Gentiles who are round about you, shall themselves bear their shame. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> But as for you, O mountains of Israel, shoot ye forth your branches, and yield your fruit to my people of Israel: for they are at hand to come. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> For lo I am for you, and I will turn to you, and you shall be ploughed and sown. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> And I will multiply men upon you, and all the house of Israel: and the cities shall be inhabited, and the ruinous places shall be repaired. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> And I will make you abound with men and with beasts: and they shall be multiplied, and increased: and I will settle you as from the beginning, and will give you greater gifts, than you had from the beginning: and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> And I will bring men upon you, my people Israel, and they shall possess thee for their inheritance: and thou shalt be their inheritance, and shalt no more henceforth be without them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Because they say of you: Thou art a devourer of men, and one that suffocatest thy nation: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:14">36:14</a> Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, nor destroy thy nation any more, saith the Lord God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:15">36:15</a> Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the nations any more, nor shalt thou bear the reproach of the people, nor lose thy nation any more, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:16">36:16</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, they defiled it with their ways, and with their doings: their way was before me like the uncleanness of a menstruous woman. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:18">36:18</a> And I poured out my indignation upon them for the blood which they had shed upon the land, and with their idols they defiled it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:19">36:19</a> And I scattered them among the nations, and they are dispersed through the countries: I have judged them according to their ways, and their devices. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:20">36:20</a> And when they entered among the nations whither they went, they profaned my holy name, when it was said of them: This is the people of the Lord, and they are come forth out of his land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:21">36:21</a> And I have regarded my own holy name, which the house of Israel hath profaned among the nations to which they went in. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:22">36:22</a> Therefore thou shalt say to the house of Israel: Thus saith the Lord God: It is not for your sake that I will do this, O house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, which you have profaned among the nations whither you went. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:23">36:23</a> And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among the Gentiles, which you have profaned in the midst of them: that the Gentiles may know that I am the Lord, saith the Lord of hosts, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:24">36:24</a> For I will take you from among the Gentiles, and will gather you together out of all the countries, and will bring you into your own land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:25">36:25</a> And I will pour upon you clean water, and you shall be cleansed from all your filthiness, and I will cleanse you from all your idols. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:26">36:26</a> And I will give you a new heart, and put a new spirit within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and will give you a heart of flesh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:27">36:27</a> And I will put my spirit in the midst of you: and I will cause you to walk in my commandments, and to keep my judgments, and do them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:28">36:28</a> And you shall dwell in the land which I gave to your fathers, and you shall be my people, and I will be your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:29">36:29</a> And I will save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will call for corn, and will multiply it, and will lay no famine upon you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:30">36:30</a> And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of the held, that you bear no more the reproach of famine among the nations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:31">36:31</a> And you shall remember your wicked ways, and your doings that were not good: and your iniquities, and your wicked deeds shall displease you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:32">36:32</a> It is not for your sakes that I will do this, saith the Lord God, be it known to you: be confounded, and ashamed at your own ways, O house of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:33">36:33</a> Thus saith the Lord God: In the day that I shall cleanse you from all your iniquities, and shall cause the cities to be inhabited, and shall repair the ruinous places, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:34">36:34</a> And the desolate land shall be tilled, which before was waste in the sight of all that passed by, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:35">36:35</a> They shall say: This land that was untilled is become as a garden of pleasure: and the cities that were abandoned, and desolate, and destroyed, are peopled and fenced. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:36">36:36</a> And the nations, that shall be left round about you, shall know that I the Lord have built up what was destroyed, and planted what was desolate, that I the Lord have spoken and done it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:37">36:37</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Moreover in this shall the house of Israel find me, that I will do it for them: I will multiply them as a flock of men, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:38">36:38</a> As a holy dock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn feasts: so shall the waste cities be full of flocks of men: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:1">37:1</a> The hand of the Lord was upon me, and brought me forth in the spirit of the Lord: and set me down in the midst of a plain that was full of bones. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:2">37:2</a> And he led me about through them on every side: now they were very many upon the face of the plain, and they were exceeding dry. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:3">37:3</a> And he said to me: Son of man, dost thou think these bones shall live? And I answered: O Lord God, thou knowest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:4">37:4</a> And he said to me: Prophesy concerning these bones; and say to them: Ye dry bones, hear the word of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:5">37:5</a> Thus saith the Lord God to these bones: Behold, I will send spirit into you, and you shall live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:6">37:6</a> And I will lay sinews upon you, and will cause flesh to grow over you, and will cover you with skin: and I will give you spirit and you shall live, and you shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:7">37:7</a> And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and as I prophesied there was a noise, and behold a commotion: and the bones came together, each one to its joint. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:8">37:8</a> And I saw, and behold the sinews, and the flesh came up upon them: and the skin was stretched out over them, but there was no spirit in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:9">37:9</a> And he said to me: Prophesy to the spirit, prophesy, O son of man, and say to the spirit: Thus saith the Lord God: Come, spirit, from the four winds, and blow upon these slain, and let them live again. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:10">37:10</a> And I prophesied as he had commanded me: and the spirit came into them, and they lived: and they stood up upon their feet, an exceeding great army. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:11">37:11</a> And he said to me: Son of man: All these bones are the house of Israel : they say: Our bones are dried up, and our hope is lost, and we are cut off. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:12">37:12</a> Therefore prophesy, and say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold I will open your graves, and will bring you out of your sepulchres, O my people: and will bring you into the land of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:13">37:13</a> And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I shall have opened your sepulchres, and shall have brought you out of your graves, O my people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:14">37:14</a> And shall have put my spirit in you, and you shall live, and I shall make you rest upon your own land: and you shall know that I the Lord have spoken, and done it, saith the Lord God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:15">37:15</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:16">37:16</a> And thou son of man, take thee a stick: and write upon it: Of Juda, and of the children of Israel his associates: and take another stick and write upon it: For Joseph the stick of Ephraim, and for all the house of Israel, and of his associates. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:17">37:17</a> And join them one to the other into one stick, and they shall become one in thy hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:18">37:18</a> And when the children of thy people shall speak to thee, saying: Wilt thou not tell us what thou meanest by this? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:19">37:19</a> Say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the tribes of Israel that are associated with him, and I will put them together with the stick of Juda, and will make them one stick: and they shall be one in his hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:20">37:20</a> And the sticks whereon thou hast written, shall be in thy hand, before their eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:21">37:21</a> And thou shalt say to them: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I will take the children of Israel from the midst of the nations whither they are gone: and I will gather them on every side, and will bring them to their own land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:22">37:22</a> And I will make them one nation in the land on the mountains of Israel, and one king shall be king over them all: and they shall no more be two nations, neither shall they be divided any more into two kingdoms. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:23">37:23</a> Nor shall they be defiled any more with their idols, nor with their abominations, nor with all their iniquities: and I will save them out of all the places in which they have sinned, and I will cleanse them: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:24">37:24</a> And my servant David shall be king over them, and they shall have one shepherd: they shall walk in my judgments, and shall keep my commandments, and shall do them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:25">37:25</a> And they shall dwell in the land which I gave to my servant Jacob, wherein your fathers dwelt, and they shall dwell in it, they and their children, and their children's children, for ever: and David my servant shall be their prince for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:26">37:26</a> And I will make a covenant of peace with them, it shall be an everlasting covenant with them : and I will establish them, and will multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of them for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:27">37:27</a> And my tabernacle shall be with them: and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:28">37:28</a> And the nations shall know that I am the Lord the sanctifier of Israel, when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:1">38:1</a> And the word of the Lord came to me, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:2">38:2</a> Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal: and prophesy of him, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:3">38:3</a> And say to him: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, O Gog, the chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:4">38:4</a> And I will turn thee about, and I will put a bit in thy jaws: and I will bring thee forth, and ail thy army, horses and horsemen all clothed with coats of mail, a great multitude, armed with spears and shields and swords. </p>

 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> After many days thou shalt be visited: at the end of years thou shalt come to the land that is returned from the sword, and is gathered out of many nations, to the mountains of Israel which have been continually waste: but it hath been brought forth out of the nations, and they shall all of them dwell securely in </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:9">38:9</a> And thou shalt go up and come like a storm, and like a cloud to cover the land, thou and all thy bands and many people with thee. </p>

 <p><a name="an_38:13">38:13</a> Saba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tharsis, and all the lions thereof shall say to thee: Art thou come to take spoils? behold, thou hast gathered thy multitude to take a prey, to take silver, and gold, and to carry away goods and substance, and to take rich spoils. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:14">38:14</a> Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy and say to Cog: Thus saith the Lord God: Shalt thou not know, in that day, when my people of Israel shall dwell securely? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:15">38:15</a> And then shalt come out of thy place from the northern parts, thou and many people with thee, all of them riding upon horses, a great company and a mighty army. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:16">38:16</a> And thou shalt come upon my people of Israel like a cloud, to cover the earth. Thou shalt be in the latter days, and I will bring thee upon my land: that the nations may know me, when I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:17">38:17</a> Thus saith the Lord God: Thou then art he, of whom I have spoken in the days of old, by my servants the prophets of Israel, who prophesied in the days of those times that I would bring thee upon them. </p>

 <p><a name="an_38:19">38:19</a> And I have spoken in my zeal, and in the fire of my anger, that in that day there shall be a great commotion upon the land of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:20">38:20</a> So that the fishes of the sea, and the birds of the air, and the beasts of the field, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the ground, and all men that are upon the face of the earth, shall be moved at my presence: and the mountains shall be thrown down, and the hedges shall fall, and every wall shall fall to the ground. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:21">38:21</a> And I will call in the sword against him in all my mountains, saith the Lord God: every man's sword shall be pointed against his brother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:22">38:22</a> And I will judge him with pestilence, and with blood, and with violent rain, and vast hailstones: I will rain fire and brimstone upon him, and upon his army, and upon the many nations that are with him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:23">38:23</a> And I will be magnified, and I will be sanctified: and I will be known in the eyes of many nations: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:1">39:1</a> And thou, son of man, prophesy against Cog, and say: Thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I come against thee, O Cog, the chief prince of Mosoch and Thubal. </p>

 <p><a name="an_39:5">39:5</a> Thou shalt fall upon the face of the field: for I have spoken it, saith the Lord God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:6">39:6</a> And I will send a fire on Magog, and on them that dwell confidently in the islands: and they shall know that I am the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:7">39:7</a> And I will make my holy name known in the midst of my people Israel, and my holy name shall be profaned no more: and the Gentiles shall know that I am the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:8">39:8</a> Behold it cometh, and it is done, saith the Lord God: this is the day whereof I have spoken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:9">39:9</a> And the inhabitants shall go forth of the cities of Israel, and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, the shields, and the spears, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves and the pikes: and they shall burn them with fire seven years. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:10">39:10</a> And they shall not bring wood out of the countries, nor cut down out of the forests: for they shall burn the weapons with fire, and shall make a prey of them to whom they had been a prey, and they shall rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord God. </p>

 <p><a name="an_41:7">41:7</a> And there was a broad passage round about, going up by winding stairs, and it led into the upper loft of the temple all round: therefore was the temple broader in the higher parts: and so from the lower parts they went to the higher by the midst. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:8">41:8</a> And I saw in the house the height round about, the foundations of the side chambers which were the measure of a reed the space of six cubits: </p>

 <p><a name="an_41:18">41:18</a> And there were cherubims and palm trees wrought, so that a palm tree was between a cherub and a cherub, and every cherub had two faces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:19">41:19</a> The face of a man was toward the palm tree on one side, and the face of a lion was toward the palm tree on the other side: set forth through all the house round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:20">41:20</a> From the ground even to the upper parts of the gate, were cherubims and palm trees wrought in the wall of the temple. </p>

 <p><a name="an_41:22">41:22</a> The altar of wood was three cubits high: and the length thereof was two cubits: and the corners thereof, and the length thereof, and the walls thereof were of wood. And he said to me: This is the table before the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:23">41:23</a> And there were two doors in the temple, and in the sanctuary. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:24">41:24</a> And in the two doors on both sides were two little doors, which were folded within each other: for there were two wickets on both sides of the doors. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:25">41:25</a> And there were cherubims also wrought in the doors of the temple, and the figures of palm trees, like as were made on the walls: for which cause also the planks were thicker in the front of the porch without. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:26">41:26</a> Upon which were the oblique windows, and the representation of palm trees on this side, and on that side in the sides of the porch, according to the sides of the house, and the breadth of the walls. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:1">42:1</a> And he brought me forth into the outward court by the way that leadeth to the north, and he brought me into the chamber that was over against the separate building, and over against the house toward the north. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:2">42:2</a> In the face of the north door was the length of a hundred cubits, and the breadth of fifty cubits. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:3">42:3</a> Over against the twenty cubits of the inner court, and over against the pavement of the outward court that was paved with stone, where there was a gallery joined to a triple gallery. </p>

 <p><a name="an_42:5">42:5</a> Where were the store chambers lower above: because they bore up the galleries, which appeared above out of them from the lower parts, and from the midst of the building. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:6">42:6</a> For they were of three stories, and had not pillars, as the pillars of the courts: therefore did they appear above out of the lower places, and out of the middle places, fifty cubits from the ground. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:7">42:7</a> And the outward wall that went about by the chambers, which were towards the outward court on the forepart of the chambers, was fifty cubits long. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:8">42:8</a> For the length of the chambers of the outward court was fifty cubits: and the length before the face of the temple, a hundred cubits. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:9">42:9</a> And there was under these chambers, an entrance from the east, for them that went into them out of the outward court. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:10">42:10</a> In the breadth of the outward wall of the court that was toward the east, over against the separate building, and there were chambers before the building. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:11">42:11</a> And the way before them was like the chambers which were toward the north: they wore as long as they, and as broad as they: and all the going is to them, and their fashions, and their doors were alike. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:12">42:12</a> According to the doors of the chambers that were towards the south : there was a door in the head of the way, which way was before the porch, separated towards the east as one entereth in. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:13">42:13</a> And he said to me: The chambers of the north, and the chambers of the south, which are before the separate building: they are holy chambers, in which the priests shall eat, that approach to the Lord into the holy of holies: there they shall lay the most holy things, and the offering for sin, and for trespass: for it is a holy place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:14">42:14</a> And when the priests shall have entered in, they shall not go out of the holy places into the outward court: but there they shall lay their vestments, wherein they minister, for they are holy: and they shall put on other garments, and so they shall go forth to the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:15">42:15</a> Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he brought me out by the way of the gate that looked toward the east: and he measured it on every side round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:16">42:16</a> And he measured toward the east with the measuring reed, five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:17">42:17</a> And he measured toward the north five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:18">42:18</a> And towards the south he measured five hundred reeds with the measuring reed round about. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:19">42:19</a> And toward the west he measured five hundred reeds, with the measuring reed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:20">42:20</a> By the four winds he measured the wall thereof on every side round about, five hundred cubits long and five hundred cubits broad, making a separation between the sanctuary and the place of the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:1">43:1</a> And he brought me to the gate that looked towards the east. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:2">43:2</a> And behold the glory of the God of Israel came in by the way of the east: and his voice was like the noise of many waters, and the earth shone with his majesty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:3">43:3</a> And I saw the vision according to the appearance which I had seen when he came to destroy the city: and the appearance was according to the vision which I had seen by the river Chobar: and I fell upon my face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:4">43:4</a> And the majesty of the Lord went into the temple by the way of the gate that looked to the east. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:5">43:5</a> And the spirit lifted me up and brought me into the inner court: and behold the house was filled with the glory of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:6">43:6</a> And I heard one speaking to me out of the house, and the man that stood by me, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:7">43:7</a> Said to me: Son of man, the place of my throne, and the place of the soles of my feet, where I dwell in the midst of the children of Israel for ever: and the house of Israel shall no more profane my holy name, they and their kings by their fornications, and by the carcasses of their kings, and by the high places. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:8">43:8</a> They who have set their threshold by my threshold, and their posts by my posts: and there was but a wall between me and them: and they profaned my holy name by the abominations which they committed: for which reason I consumed them in my wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:9">43:9</a> Now therefore let them put away their fornications, and the carcasses of their kings far from me: and I will dwell in the midst of them for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:10">43:10</a> But thou, son of man, shew to the house of Israel the temple, and let them be ashamed of their iniquities, and let them measure the building: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:11">43:11</a> And be ashamed of all that they have done.
