  <h3 align="center">Douay-Rheims Bible: Isaiah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> THE vision of Isaias the son of Amos I which he saw concerning Juda and Jerusalem in the days of Ozias, Joathan, Achaz, and Ezechias, kings of Juda </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Hear, O ye heavens, and give ear, O earth, for the Lord hath spoken. I have brought up children, and exalted them: but they have despised me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but Israel hath not known me, and my people hath not understood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Woe to the sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a wicked seed, ungracious children: they have forsaken the Lord, they have blasphemed the Holy One of Israel, they are gone away backwards. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> For what shall I strike you any more, you that increase transgression? the whole head is sick, and the whole heart is sad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> From the sole of the foot unto the top of the head, there is no soundness therein: wounds and bruises and swelling sores: they are not bound up, nor dressed, nor fomented with oil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Your land is desolate, your cities are burnt with fire: your country strangers devour before your face, and it shall be desolate as when wasted by enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And the daughter of Sion shall be left as a covert in a vineyard, and as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, and as a city that is laid waste. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Except the Lord of hosts had left us seed, we had been as Sodom, and we should have been like to Gomorrha. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Hear the word of the Lord, ye rulers of Sodom, give ear to the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrha. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> To what purpose do you offer me the multitude of your victims, saith the Lord? I am full, I desire not holocausts of rams, and fat of fatlings, and blood of calves, and lambs, and buck goats. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> When you came to appear before me, who required these things at your hands, that you should walk in my courts? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Offer sacrifice no more in vain: incense is an abomination tome. The new moons, and the sabbaths, and other festivals I will not abide, your assemblies are wicked. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> My soul hateth your new moons, and your solemnities: they are become troublesome to me, I am weary of bearing them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And when you stretch forth your hands, I will turn away my eyes from you: and when you multiply prayer, I will not hear: for your hands are full of blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> Wash yourselves, be clean, take away the evil of your devices from my eyes: cease to do perversely, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Learn to do well: seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge for the fatherless, defend the widow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And then come, and accuse me, saith the Lord: if your sins be as scarlet, they shall be made as white as snow: and if they be red as crimson, they shall be white as wool. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> if you be willing, and will hearken to me, you shall eat the good things of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> But if you will not, and will provoke me to wrath: the sword shall devour you because the mouth of the Lord hath spoken it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> How is the faithful city, that was full of judgment, become a harlot? justice dwelt in it, but now murderers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> Thy silver is turned into dress: thy wine is mingled with water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> Thy princes are faithless, companions of thieves: they all love bribes, the run after rewards. They judge not for the fatherless: and the widow's cometh not in to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Therefore saith the Lord the God of hosts, the mighty one of Israel: Ah! I will comfort myself over my adversaries: and I will be revenged of my enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And I will turn my hand to thee, and I will clean purge away thy dress, and I will take away all thy tin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> And I will restore thy judges se they were before, and thy counsellors as of old. After this thou shalt be called the city of the just, a faithful city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> Sion shall be redeemed in judgment, and they shall bring her back in justice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> And he shall destroy the wicked, and the sinners together: and they that have forsaken the Lord, shall be consumed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> For they shall be confounded for the idols, to which they have sacrificed: and you shall be ashamed of the gardens which you have chosen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> When you shall be as an oak with the leaves falling off, and as a garden without water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> And your strength shall be as the ashes of tow, and your work as a spark: and both shall burn together, and there shall be none to quench it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> THE word that Isaias the son of Amos saw, concerning Juda and Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And in the last days the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be prepared on the top of mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills, and all nations shall flow unto it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And many people shall go, and say: Come and let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall come forth from Sion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And he shall judge the Gentiles, and rebuke many people: and they shall turn their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into sickles: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they be exercised any more to war. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob: because they are filled as in times past, and have had soothsayers as the Philistines, and have adhered to strange children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Their land is filled with silver and gold: and there is no end of their treasures. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And their land is filled with horses: and their chariots are innumerable. Their land also is full of idols: they have adored the work of their own hands, which their own fingers have made. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And man hath bowed himself down, and man hath been debased: therefore forgive them not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Enter thou into the rock, and hide thee in the pit from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> The lofty eyes of man are humbled, and the haughtiness of men shall be made to stoop: and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Because the day of the Lord of hosts shall be upon every one that is proud and highminded, and upon every one that is arrogant, and he shall be humbled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And upon all the tall and lofty cedars of Libanus, and upon all the oaks of Basan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the elevated hills. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And upon every high tower, and every fenced wall. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And upon all the ships of Tharsis, and upon all that is fair to behold. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the loftiness of men shall be bowed down, and the haughtiness of men shall be humbled, and the Lord alone shall be exalted in that day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And idols shall be utterly destroyed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And they shall go into the holes of rocks, and into the caves of the earth from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> In that day a man shall cast away his idols of silver, and his idols of gold, which he had made for himself to adore, moles and bats. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And he shall go into the clefts of rocks, and into the holes of stones from the face of the fear of the Lord, and from the glory of his majesty, when he shall rise up to strike the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> Cease ye therefore from the man, whose breath is in his nostrils, for he is reputed high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> FOR behold the sovereign the Lord of hosts shall take away from Jerusalem, and from Juda the valiant and the strong, the whole strength of bread, and the whole strength of water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> The strong man, and the man of war, the judge, and the prophet, and the cunning man, and the ancient. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> The captain over fifty, and the honourable in countenance, and the counsellor, and the architect, and the skilful in eloquent speech. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And I will give children to be their princes, and the effeminate shall rule over them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And the people shall rush one upon another, and every man against his neighbour: the child shall make it tumult against the ancient, and the base against the honourable. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> For a man shall take hold or his brother, one of the house of his father, saying: Thou hast a garment, be thou our ruler, and let this ruin be under thy hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> In that day he shall answer, saying: I am no healer, and in my house there is no bread, nor clothing: make me not ruler of the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> For Jerusalem is ruined, and Juda is fallen: because their tongue, and their devices are against the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his majesty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> The shew of their countenance hath answered them: and they have proclaimed abroad their sin as Sodom, and they have not hid it: woe to their souls, for evils are rendered to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Say to the just man that it is well, for he shall eat the fruit of his doings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Woe to the wicked unto evil: for the reward of his hands shall be given him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> As for my people, their oppressors have stripped them, and women have ruled over them. O my people, they that call thee blessed, the same deceive thee, and destroy the way of thy steps. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> The Lord standeth up to judge, and he standeth to judge the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> The Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people, and its princes: for you have devoured the vineyard, and the spoil of the poor is in your house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> Why do you consume my people, and grind the faces of the poor? saith the Lord the God of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And the Lord said: Because the daughters of Sion are haughty, and have walked with stretched out necks, and wanton glances of their eyes, and made a noise as they walked with their feet and moved in a set pace: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> The Lord will make bald the crown of the head of the daughters of Sion, and the Lord will discover their hair. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> In that day the Lord will take away the ornaments of shoes, end little moons, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> And chains and necklaces, and bracelets, and bonnets, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> And bodkins, and ornaments of the legs, and tablets, and sweet balls, and earrings, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And rings, and jewels hanging on the forehead, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And changes of apparel, and short cloaks, and fine linen, and crisping pins, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And looking-glasses, and lawns, and headbands, and fine veils. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> And instead of a sweet smell there shall be stench, and instead of a girdle, a cord, and instead of curled hair, baldness, and instead of a stomacher, haircloth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Thy fairest men also shall fall by the sword, and thy valiant ones in battle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> And her gates shall lament and mourn, and she shall sit desolate on the ground. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> AND in that day seven women shall take hold of one man, saying: We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel: only let us be called by thy name, take away our reproach. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> In that day the bud of the Lord shall be in magnificence and glory, and the fruit of the earth shall be high, and a great joy to them that shall have escaped of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And it shall come to pass, that every one that shall be left in Sion, and that shall remain in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, every one that is written in life in Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> If the Lord shall wash away the filth of the daughters of Sion, and shall wash away the blood of Jerusalem out of the midst thereof, by the spirit of judgment, and by the spirit of burning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And the Lord will create upon every place of mount Sion, and where he is called upon, a cloud by day, and a smoke and the brightness of a flaming fire in the night: for over all the glory shall be a protection. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And there shall be a tabernacle for a shade in the daytime from the heat, and for a security and covert from the whirlwind, and from rain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> I WILL sing to my beloved the canticle of my cousin concerning his vineyard. My beloved had a vineyard on a hill in a fruitful place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And he fenced it in, and picked the stones out of it, and planted it with the choicest vines, and built a tower in the midst thereof, and set up a winepress therein: and he looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild grapes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And now, O ye inhabitants of Jerusalem, and ye men of Juda, judge between me and my vineyard. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> What is there that I ought to do more to my vineyard, that I have not done to it? was it that I looked that it should bring forth grapes, and it hath brought forth wild grapes? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And now I will shew you what I will do to my vineyard. I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be wasted: I will break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And I will make it desolate: it shall not be pruned, and it shall not be digged: but briers and thorns shall come up: and I will command the clouds to rain no rain upon it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> For the vineyard of the Lord of hosts is the house of Israel: and the man of Juda, his pleasant plant: and I looked that he should do judgment, and behold iniquity: and do justice, and behold a cry. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Woe to you that join house to house and lay field to field, even to the end of the place: shall you alone dwell in the midst of the earth? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> These things are in my ears, saith the Lord of hosts: Unless many great and fair houses shall become desolate, without an inhabitant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> For ten acres of vineyard shall yield one little measure, and thirty bushels of seed shall yield three bushels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Woe to you that rise up early in the morning to follow drunkenness, and to drink till the evening, to be inflamed with wine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> The harp, and the lyre, and the timbrel, and the pipe, and wine are in your feasts: and the work of the Lord you regard not, nor do you consider the works of his hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Therefore is my people led away captive, because they had not knowledge, and their nobles have perished with famine, and their multitude were dried up with thirst. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Therefore hath hell enlarged her soul, and opened her mouth without any bounds, and their strong ones, and their people, and their high and glorious ones shall go down into it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And man shall be brought down, and man shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be brought low. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> And the Lord of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the holy God shall be sanctified in justice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And the lambs shall feed according to their order, and strangers shall eat the deserts turned into fruitfulness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Woe to you that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin as the rope of a cart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> That say: Let him make haste, and let his work come quickly, that we may see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel come, that we may know it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> Woe to you that call evil good, and good evil: that put darkness for light, and light for darkness: that put bitter for sweet, and sweet for bitter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> Woe to you that rue wise in your own eyes, and prudent in your own conceits. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> Woe to you that are mighty to drink wine, and stout men at drunkenness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> That justify the wicked for gifts, and take away the justice of the just from him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> Therefore as the tongue of the fire devoureth the stubble, and the heat of the dame consumeth it: so shall their root be as ashes, and their bud shall go up se dust: for they have cast away the law of the Lord of hosts, and have blasphemed the word of the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> Therefore is the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, and he hath stretched out his hand upon them, and struck them: and the mountains were troubled, and their carcasses became as dung in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> And he will lift up a sign to the nations afar off, and will whistle to them from the ends of the earth: and behold they shall come with speed swiftly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> There is none that shall faint, nor labour among them: they shall not slumber nor sleep, neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed, nor the latchet of their shoes be broken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> Their arrows are sharp, and all their bows are bent. The hoofs of their horses shall be like the hint, and their wheels like the violence of a tempest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> Their roaring like that of a lion, they shall roar like young lions: yea they shall roar, and take hold of the prey, and they shall keep fast hold of it, and there shall be none to deliver it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> And they shall make a noise against them that day, like the roaring of the sea; we shall look towards the land, and behold darkness of tribulation, and the light is darkened with the mist thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> IN the year that king Ozias died, I saw the Lord sitting upon a throne high and elevated: and his train filled the temple. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Upon it stood the seraphims: the one had six wings, and the other had six wings: with two they covered his face, and with two they covered his feet, and with two they hew. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And they cried one to another, and said: Holy, holy, holy, the Lord God of hosts, all the earth is full of his glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And the lintels of the doors were moved at the voice of him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And I said: Woe is me, because I have held my peace; because I am a man of unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people that hath unclean lips, and I have seen with my eyes the King the Lord of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And one of the seraphims flew to me, and in his hand was a live coal, which he had taken with the tongs off the altar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And he touched my mouth, and said: Behold this hath touched thy lips, and thy iniquities shall be taken away, and thy sin shall be cleansed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And I heard the voice of the Lord, saying: Whom shall I send? and who shall go for us? And I said: Lo, here am I, send me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And he said: Go, and thou shalt say to this people: Hearing, hear, and understand not: and see the vision, and know it not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> Blind the heart of this people, and make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be converted and I heal them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And I said: How long, O Lord? And he said: Until the cities be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and the land shall be left desolate. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And the Lord shall remove men far away, and she shall be multiplied that was left in the midst of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And there shall be still a tithing therein, and she shall turn, and shall be made a show as a turpentine tree, and as an oak that spreadeth its branches: that which shall stand therein, shall be a holy seed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> AND it came to pass in the days of Achaz the son of Joathan, the son of Ozias, king of Juda, that Basin king of Syria, and Phacee the son of Romelia king of Israel, came up to Jerusalem, to fight against it: but they could not prevail over it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And they told the house of David, saying: Syria hath rested upon Ephraim, and his heart was moved, and the heart of his people, as the trees of the woods are moved with the wind. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And the Lord said to Isaias: Go forth to meet Achaz, thou and Jasub thy son that is left, to the conduit of the upper pool, in the way of the fuller's field. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And thou shalt say to him: See thou be quiet: fear not, and let not thy heart be afraid of the two tails of these fire brands, smoking with the wrath of the fury of Rasin king of Syria, end of the son of Romelia. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Because Syria hath taken counsel against thee, unto the evil of Ephraim and the son of Romelia, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Let us go up to Juda, and rouse it up, and draw it away to us, and make the son of Tabeel king in the midst thereof. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Thus saith the Lord God: It shall not stand, and this shall not be. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> But the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is Basin: and within threescore and five years, Ephraim shall cease to be a people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And the head of Ephraim is Samaria and the head of Samaria the son of Romelia. If you will not believe, you shall not continue. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And the Lord spoke again to Achaz, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Ask thee a sign of the Lord thy God either unto the depth of hell, or unto the height above. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And Achaz said: I will not ask, and I will not tempt the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And he said: Hear ye therefore, O house of David: Is it a small thing for you to be grievous to men, that you are grievous to my God also? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and his name shall be called Emmanuel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> He shall eat butter and honey, that he may know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> For before the child know to refuse the evil, and to choose the good, the land which thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of the face of her two kings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> The Lord shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon the house of thy father, days that have not come since the time of the separation of Ephraim from Juda with the king of the Assyrians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall hiss for the fly, that is in the uttermost parts of the rivers of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> And they shall come, and shall all of them rest in the torrents of the valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all places set with shrubs, and in all hollow places. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> In that day the Lord shall shave with a razor that is hired by them that are beyond the river, by the king of the Assyrians, the head and the hairs of the feet, and the whole beard. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall nourish a young cow, and two sheep. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> And for the abundance of milk he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall every one eat that shall be left in the midst of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place where there were a thousand vines, at a thousand pieces of silver, shall become thorns and briers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> With arrows and with bows they shall go in thither: for briars and thorns shall be in all the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> And as for all the hills that shall be raked with a rake, the fear of thorns and briers shall not come thither, but they shall be for the ox to feed on, and the lesser cattle to tread upon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> AND the Lord said to me: Take thee a great book, and write in it with a man's pen. Take sway the spoils with speed, quickly take the prey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And I took unto me faithful witnesses, Urias the priest, and Zacharias the son of Barachias. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And I went to the prophetess, and she conceived, and bore a son. And the Lord said to me: Call his name, Hasten to take away the spoils: Make haste to take away the prey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> For before the child know to call his father and his mother, the strength of Damascus, and the spoils of Samaria shall be taken away before the king of the Assyrians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And the Lord spoke to me again, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Forasmuch as this people hath cast away the waters of Siloe, that go with silence, and hath rather taken Basin, and the son of Romelia: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> Therefore behold the Lord will bring upon them the waters of the river strong and many, the king of the Assyrians, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his channels, and shall overflow all his banks, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And shall pass through Juda, overflowing, and going over shall reach even to the neck. And the stretching out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Emmanuel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> Gather yourselves together, O ye people, and be overcome, and give ear, all ye lands afar off: strengthen yourselves, end be overcome, gird yourselves, and be overcome. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> Take counsel together, and it shall be defeated: speak a word, and it shall not be done: because God is with us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> For thus saith the Lord to me: As he hath taught me, with a strong arm, that I should not walk in the way of this people, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Say ye not: A conspiracy: for all that this people speaketh, is a conspiracy: neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> Sanctify the Lord of hosts himself: and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And he shall be a sanctification to you. But for a stone or stumbling, and for a rock of offence to the two houses of Israel, for a snare and a ruin to the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And very many of them shall stumble and fall, and shall be broken in pieces, and shall be snared, and taken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And I will wait for the Lord, who hath hid his face from the house of Jacob, and I will look for him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> Behold I and my children, whom the Lord hath given me for a sign, and for a wonder in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwelleth in mount Sion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> And when they shall say to you: Seek of pythons, and of diviners, who mutter in their enchantments: should not the people seek of their God, for the living of the dead? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> To the law rather, and to the testimony. And if they speak not according to this word, they shall not have the morning light. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> And they shall pass by it, they shall fall, and be hungry: and when they shall be hungry, they will be angry, and curse their king, and their God, and look upwards. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> And they shall look to the earth, and behold trouble and darkness, weakness and distress, and a mist following them, and they cannot fly away from their distress. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> AT the first time the land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephtali was lightly touched: and at the last the way of the sea beyond the Jordan of the Galilee of the Gentiles was heavily loaded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> The people that walked in darkness, have seen a great light: to them that dwelt in the region of the shadow of death, light is risen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> Thou hast multiplied the nation, and hast not increased the joy. They shall rejoice before thee, as they that rejoice in the harvest, as conquerors rejoice after taking a prey, when they divide the spoils. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> For the yoke of their burden, and the rod of their shoulder, and the sceptre of their oppressor thou best overcome, as in the day of Median. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> For every violent taking of spoils, with tumult, and garment mingled with blood, shall be burnt, and be fuel for the fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> For a CHILD IS BORN to us, and a son is given to us, and the government is upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called, Wonderful, Counsellor, God the Mighty, the Father of the world to come, the Prince of Peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> His empire shall be multiplied, and there shall be no end of peace: he shall sit upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom; to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice, from henceforth and for ever: the zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And all the people of Ephraim shall know, and the inhabitants of Samaria that say in the pride and haughtiness of their heart: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with square stones: they have cut down the sycamores, but we will change them for cedars. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And the Lord shall set up the enemies of Rasin over him, and shall bring on his enemies in a crowd: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> The Syrians from the east, and the Philistines from the west: and they shall devour Israel with open mouth, For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And the people are not returned to him who hath struck them, and have not sought after the Lord of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And the Lord shall destroy out of Israel the head and the tail, him that bendeth down, and him that holdeth back, in one day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> The aged and honourable, he is the head: and the prophet that teacheth lies, he is the tail. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And they that call this people blessed, shall cause them to err: and they that are called blessed, shall be thrown down headlong. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> Therefore the Lord shell have no joy in their young men: neither shall he have mercy on their fatherless, and widows: for every one is a hypocrite and wicked, and every mouth hath spoken folly. For all this his indignation is not turned away, but his bend is stretched out still. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> For wickedness is kindled as a fire, it shall devour the brier and the thorn: and shall kindle in the thicket of the forest, and it shall be wrapped up in smoke ascending on high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> By the wrath of the Lord of hosts the land is troubled, and the people shall be as fuel for the fire: no man shall spare his brother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And he shall turn to the right hand, and shall be hungry: and shall eat on the left hand, and shall not be filled: every one shell eat the flesh of his own arm: Manasses Ephraim, and Ephraim Manasses, and they together shall be against Juda. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> After all these things his indignation is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> WOE to them that make wicked laws: and when they write, write injustice: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> To oppress the poor in judgment, and do violence to the cause of the humble of my people: that widows might be their prey, and that they might rob the fatherless. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> What will you do in the day of visitation, and of the calamity which cometh from afar? to whom will ye flee for help? and where will ye leave your glory? </p>

 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> Woe to the Assyrian, he is the rod and the staff of my anger, and my indignation is in their hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> I will send him to a deceitful nation, and I will give him a charge against the people of my wrath, to take away the spoils, and to lay hold on the prey, and to tread them down like the mire of the streets. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> But he shall not take it so, and his heart shall not think so: but his heart shall be set to destroy, and to cut off nations not a few. </p>

 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And it shall come to pass, that when the Lord shall have performed all his works in mount Sion, and in Jerusalem, I will visit the fruit of the proud heart of the king of Assyria, and the glory of the haughtiness of his eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> For he hath said: By the strength of my own hand I have done it, and by my own wisdom I have understood: and I have removed the bounds of the people, and have taken the spoils of the princes, and as a mighty man hath pulled down them that sat on high. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And my hand hath found the strength of the people as a nest; and as eggs are gathered, that are left, so have I gathered all the earth: and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the mouth, or made the least noise. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Shall the axe boast itself against him that cutteth with it? or shall the saw exalt itself against him by whom it is drawn? as if a rod should lift itself up against him that lifteth it up, and a staff exalt itself, which is but wood. </p>

 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> For Egypt shall help in vain, and to no purpose: therefore have I cried concerning this: It is pride only, sit still. </p>

 <p><a name="an_30:27">30:27</a> Behold the name of the Lord cometh from afar, his wrath burneth, and is heavy to bear: his lips are filled with indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire. </p>

 <p><a name="an_30:29">30:29</a> You shall have a song as in the night of the sanctified solemnity, and joy of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe, to come into the mountain of the Lord, to the Mighty One of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:30">30:30</a> And the Lord shall make the glory of his voice to be heard, and shall shew the terror of his arm, in the threatening of wrath, and the dame of devouring fire: he shall crush to pieces with whirlwind, and hailstones. </p>

 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> And the king of the Assyrians sent Rabsaces from Lachis to Jerusalem, to king Ezechias with a great army, and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool in the way of the fuller's held. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> And there went out to him Eliacim the son of Helcias, who was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe the son of Asaph the recorder. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> And Rabsaces said to them: Tell Ezechias: Thus saith the great king, the king of the Assyrians: What is this confidence wherein thou trustest? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> Or with what counsel or strength dost thou prepare for war? on whom dost thou trust, that thou art revolted from me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> Lo thou trustest upon this broken staff of a reed, upon Egypt: upon which if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce it: so is Pharao king or Egypt to all that trust in him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> But if thou wilt answer me: We trust in the Lord our God: is it not he whose high places and altars Ezechias hath taken away, and hath said to Juda and Jerusalem: You shall worship before this altar? </p>

 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> And Eliacim, and Sobna, and Joahe said to Rabsaces: Speak to thy servants in the Syrian tongue: for we understand it: speak not to us in the Jews' language in the hearing of the people, that are upon the wall. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> And Rabsaces said to them: Hath my master sent me to thy master and to thee, to speak all these words; and not rather to the men that sit on the wall; that they may eat their own dung, and drink their urine with you? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> Then Rabsaces stood, and cried out with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said: Hear the words of the great king, the king of the Assyrians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:14">36:14</a> Thus saith the king: Let not Ezechias deceive you, for he shall not be able to deliver you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:15">36:15</a> And let not Ezechias make you trust in the Lord, saying: The Lord will surely deliver us, and this city shall not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:16">36:16</a> Do not hearken to Ezechias: for thus said the king of the Assyrians: Do with me that which is for your advantage, and come out to me, and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his dg tree, and drink ye every one the water of his cistern, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> Till I come and take you away to a land, like to your own, a land of corn and of wine, a land of bread and vineyards. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:18">36:18</a> Neither let Ezechias trouble you, saying: The Lord will deliver us. Have any of the gods of the nations delivered their land out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:19">36:19</a> Where is the god of Emath and of Arphad? where is the god of Sepharvaim? have they delivered Samaria out of my hand? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:20">36:20</a> Who is there among all the gods of these lands, that hath delivered his country out of my hand, that the Lord may deliver Jerusalem out of my hand? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:21">36:21</a> And they held their peace, and answered him not a word. For the king had commanded, saying: answer him not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:22">36:22</a> And Eliacim the son of Helcias, that was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and Joahe the son of Asaph the recorder, went in to Ezechias with their garments rent, and told him the words of Rabsaces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:1">37:1</a> AND it came to pass, when king Ezechias had heard it, that he rent his garments and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into the house of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:2">37:2</a> And he sent Eliacim who was over the house, and Sobna the scribe, and the ancients of the priests covered with sackcloth, to Isaias the son of Amos the prophet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:3">37:3</a> And they said to him: Thus saith Ezechias: This day is a day of tribulation, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring forth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:4">37:4</a> It may be the Lord thy God will hear the words of Rabsaces, whom the king of the Assyrians his master hath sent to blaspheme the living God, and to reproach with words which the Lord thy God hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that is left. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:5">37:5</a> And the servants of Ezechias came to Isaias. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:6">37:6</a> And Isaias said to them: Thus shall you say to your master: Thus saith the Lord: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast heard, with which the servants of the king of the Assyrians have blasphemed me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:7">37:7</a> Behold, I will send a spirit upon him, and he shall hear a message, and shall return to his own country, and I will cause him to fall by the sword in his own country. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:8">37:8</a> And Rabsaces returned, end found the king of the Assyrians besieging Lobna. W For he had heard that he was departed from Lachis. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:9">37:9</a> And he heard say about Tharaca the king of Ethiopia: He is come forth to fight against thee. And when he heard it, he sent messengers to Ezechias, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:10">37:10</a> Thus shall you speak to Ezechias the king of Juda, saying: Let not thy God deceive thee, in whom thou trustest, saying: Jerusalem shall not be given into the hands of the king of the Assyrians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:11">37:11</a> Behold thou hast heard all that the kings of the Assyrians hare done to all countries which they have destroyed, and canst thou be delivered? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:12">37:12</a> Have the gods of the nations delivered them whom my fathers have destroyed, Gozam, and Haram, and Reseph, and the children of Eden, that were in Thalassar? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:13">37:13</a> Where is the king of Emath, and the king of Arphad, and the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Ana, and of Ava? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:14">37:14</a> And Ezechias took the letter from the hand of the messengers, and read it, and went up to the house of the Lord, and Ezechias spread it before the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:15">37:15</a> And Ezechias prayed to the Lord, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:16">37:16</a> O Lord of hosts, God of Israel, who sittest upon the cherubims, thou alone art the God of all the kingdoms of the earth, thou hast made heaven and earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:17">37:17</a> Incline, O Lord, thy ear, and hear: open, O Lord, thy eyes, and see, and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which he hath sent to blaspheme the living God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:18">37:18</a> For of a truth, O Lord, the kings of the Assyrians have laid waste lands, and their countries. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:19">37:19</a> And they have cast their gods into the fire, for they were not gods, but the works of men's hands, of wood and stone: and they broke them in pieces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:20">37:20</a> And now, O Lord our God, save us out of his hand: and let all the kingdoms of the earth know, that thou only art the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:21">37:21</a> And Isaias the son of Amos sent to Ezechias, saying: Thus saith the Lord the God of Israel: For the prayer thou hast made to me concerning Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:22">37:22</a> This is the word which the Lord hath spoken of him: The virgin the daughter of Sion hath despised thee, and laughed thee to scorn: the daughter of Jerusalem hath wagged the head after thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:23">37:23</a> Whom hast thou reproached, and whom hast thou blasphemed, and against whom hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thy eyes on high? Against the Holy One of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:24">37:24</a> By the hand of thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord: and hast said: With the multitude of my chariots I have gone up to the height of the mountains, to the top of Libanus: and I will out down its tall cedars, and its choice fir trees, end will enter to the top of its height, to the forest of its Carmel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:25">37:25</a> I have digged, and drunk water, and have dried up with the sole of my foot, all the rivers shut up in banks. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:26">37:26</a> Hast thou not heard what I have done to him of old? from the days of old I have formed it: and now I have brought it to effect: and it hath come to pass that hills fighting together, and fenced cities should be destroyed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:27">37:27</a> The inhabitants of them were weak of hand, they trembled, and were confounded: they became like the grass of the field, and the herb of the pasture, and like the grass of the housetops, which withered before it was ripe. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:28">37:28</a> I know thy dwelling, and thy going out, and thy coming in, and thy rage against me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:29">37:29</a> When thou wast mad against me, thy pride came up to my ears: therefore I will put a ring in thy nose, and a bit between thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by which thou camest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:30">37:30</a> But to thee this shall be a sign: Eat this year the things that spring of themselves, and in the second year eat fruits: but in the third year sow and reap, and giant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:31">37:31</a> And that which shall be saved of the house of Juda, and which is left, shall take root downward, and shall bear fruit upward : </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:32">37:32</a> For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a, remnant, and salvation from mount Sion: the zeal of the Lord of hosts shall do this. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:33">37:33</a> Wherefore thus saith the Lord concerning the king of the Assyrians: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow into it, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a trench about it. </p>

 <p><a name="an_37:35">37:35</a> And I will protect this city, and will save it for my own sake, and for the sake of David my servant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:36">37:36</a> And the angel of the Lord went out, and slew in the camp of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And they arose in the morning, and behold they were all dead corpses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:37">37:37</a> And Sennacherib the king of the Assyrians went out and departed, and returned, and dwelt in Ninive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:38">37:38</a> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the temple of Nesroch his god, that Adramelech and Sarasar his sons slew him with the sword: and they fled into the land of Ararat, and Asarhaddon his son reigned in his stead. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:1">38:1</a> IN those days Ezechias was sick even to death, and Isaias the son of Amos the prophet came unto him, and said to him: Thus saith the Lord: Take order with thy house, for thou shalt die, and not live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:2">38:2</a> And Ezechias turned his face toward the wall, and prayed to the Lord, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:3">38:3</a> And said: I beseech thee, O Lord, remember how I have walked before thee in truth, and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Ezechias wept with great weeping. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:4">38:4</a> And the word of the Lord came to Isaias, saying: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:5">38:5</a> Go and say to Ezechias: Thus saith the Lord the God of David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, and I have seen thy tears: behold I will add to thy days fifteen years: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:6">38:6</a> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of the Assyrians, and I will protect it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:7">38:7</a> And this shall be a sign to thee from the Lord, that the Lord will do this word which he hath spoken: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> Behold I will bring again the shadow of the lines, by which it is now gone down in the sun dial of Achaz with the sun, ten lines backward. And the sun returned ten lines by the degrees by which it was gone down. </p>

 <p><a name="an_38:10">38:10</a> I said: In the midst of my days I shall go to the gates of hell: I sought for the residue of my years. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:11">38:11</a> I said: I shall not see the Lord God in the land of the living. I shall behold man no more, nor the inhabitant of rest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:12">38:12</a> My generation is at an end, and it is rolled away from me, as a shepherd's tent. My life is cut off, as by a weaver: whilst I was yet but beginning, he out me off: from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:13">38:13</a> I hoped till morning, as a lion so hath he broken all my bones: from morning even to night thou wilt make an end of me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:14">38:14</a> I will cry like a young swallow, I will meditate like a dove: my eyes are weakened looking upward: Lord, I suffer violence, answer thou for me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:15">38:15</a> What shall I say, or what shall he answer for me, whereas he himself hath done it? I will recount to thee all my years in the bitterness of my soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:16">38:16</a> O Lord, if man's life be such, and the life of my spirit be in such things as these, thou shalt correct me, and make me to live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:17">38:17</a> Behold in peace is my bitterness most bitter: but thou best delivered my soul that it should not perish, thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:18">38:18</a> For hell shall not confess to thee, neither shall death praise thee: nor shall they that go down into the pit, look for thy truth. </p>

 <p><a name="an_38:21">38:21</a> Now Isaias had ordered that they should take a lump of figs, and lay it as it plaster upon the wound, and that he should be healed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:22">38:22</a> And Ezechias bed said: What shah be the sign that I shah go up to the house of the Lord? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:1">39:1</a> AT that time Merodach Baladan, the son of Baladan king of Babylon, sent letters and presents to Ezechias: for he had heard that he had been sick and was recovered. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:2">39:2</a> And Ezechias rejoiced at their coming, and he shewed them the storehouses of his aromatical spices, and of the silver, and of the gold, and of the sweet odours, and of the precious ointment, and all the storehouses of his furniture, and all things that were found in his treasures. There was nothing in his house, nor in all his dominion that Ezechias shewed them not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:3">39:3</a> Then Isaias the prophet came to king Ezechias, and said to him: What said these men, and from whence came they to thee? And Ezechias said: From a far country they came to me, from Babylon </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:4">39:4</a> And he said: What saw they in thy house? And Ezechias said: All things that are in my house have they seen, there was not any thing which I have not shewn them in my treasures. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:5">39:5</a> And Isaias said to Ezechias: Rear the word of the Lord of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:6">39:6</a> Behold the days shall come, that all that is in thy house, and that thy fathers have laid up in store until this day, shall be carried away into Babylon: there shall not any thing be left, saith the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:7">39:7</a> And of thy children, that shall issue from thee, whom thou shalt beget, they shall take away, and they shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon. </p>

 <p><a name="an_51:20">51:20</a> Thy children are cast forth, they have slept at the head of all the ways, as the wild ox that is snared: full of the indignation of the Lord, of the rebuke of thy God. </p>

 <p><a name="an_51:22">51:22</a> Thus saith thy Sovereign the Lord and thy God, who will fight for his people: Behold I have taken out of thy hand the cup of dead sleep, the dregs of the cup of my indignation, thou shalt not drink it again any more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:23">51:23</a> And I will put it in the hand of them that have oppressed thee, and have said to thy soul: Bow down, that we may go over: and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as a way to them that went over. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:1">52:1</a> ARISE, arise, put on thy strength, O Sion, put on the garments of thy glory, O Jerusalem, the city of the Holy One: for henceforth the uncircumcised, and unclean shall no more pass through thee. </p>

 <p><a name="an_53:5">53:5</a> But he was wounded for our iniquities, he was bruised for our sins: the chastisement of our peace was upon him, and by his bruises we are healed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:6">53:6</a> All we like sheep have gone astray, every one hath turned aside into his own way: and the Lord hath laid on him the iniquity of us all. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:7">53:7</a> He was offered because it was his own will, and he opened not his mouth: he shall be led as a sheep to the slaughter, and shall be dumb as a lamb before his shearer, and he shall not open his mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:8">53:8</a> He was taken away from distress, and from judgment: who shall declare his generation? because he is cut oh out of the land of the living: for the wickedness of my people have I struck him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:9">53:9</a> And he shall give the ungodly for his burial, and the rich for his death: because he hath done no iniquity, neither was there deceit in his mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:10">53:10</a> And the Lord was pleased to bruise him in infirmity: if he shall lay down his life for sin, he shall see a long-lived seed, and the will of the Lord shall be prosperous in his hand. </p>

 <p><a name="an_53:12">53:12</a> Therefore will I distribute to him very many, and he shall divide the spoils of the strong, because he hath delivered his soul unto death, and was reputed with the wicked: and he hath borne the sins of many, and hath prayed for the transgressors. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:1">54:1</a> GIVE praise, O thou barren, that bearest not: sing forth praise, and make a joyful noise, thou that didst not travail with child: for many are the children of the desolate, more than of her that hath a husband, saith the Lord. </p>

 <p><a name="an_58:3">58:3</a> Why have we fasted, and thou hast not regarded: have we humbled our souls, and thou hast not taken notice? Behold in the day of your fast your own will is found, and you exact of all your debtors. </p>

 <p><a name="an_58:5">58:5</a> Is this such a fast as I have chosen: for a man to afflict his soul for a day? is this it, to wind his head about like a circle, and to spread sackcloth and ashes? wilt thou call this a fast, and a day acceptable to the Lord? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:6">58:6</a> Is not this rather the fast that I have chosen? loose the bands of wickedness, undo the bundles that oppress, let them that are broken go free, and break asunder every burden. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:7">58:7</a> Deal thy bread to the hungry, and bring the needy and the harbourless into thy house: when thou shalt see one naked, cover him, and despise not thy own flesh. </p>

 <p><a name="an_58:10">58:10</a> When thou shalt pour out thy soul to the hungry, and shalt satisfy the afflicted soul then shall thy light rise up in darkness, and thy darkness shall be as the noonday. </p>

 <p><a name="an_59:2">59:2</a> But your iniquities have divided between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you that he should not hear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:3">59:3</a> For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with iniquity: your lips have spoken lies, and your tongue uttereth iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:4">59:4</a> There is none that calleth upon justice, neither is there any one that judgeth truly: but they trust in a mere nothing, and speak vanities: they have conceived labour, and brought forth iniquity. </p>

 <p><a name="an_59:14">59:14</a> And judgment is turned away backward, and justice hath stood far off: because truth bath fallen down in the street, and equity could not come in. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:15">59:15</a> And truth hath been forgotten: and he that departed from evil, lay open to be a prey: and the Lord saw, and it appeared evil in his eyes, because there is no judgment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:16">59:16</a> And he saw that there is not a man: and he stood astonished, because there is none to oppose himself: and his own arm brought salvation to him, and his own justice supported him. </p>

And they shall declare my glory to the Gentiles: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:20">66:20</a> And they shall bring all your brethren out of all nations for a gift to the Lord, upon horses, and in chariots, and in litters, and on mules, and in coaches, to my holy mountain Jerusalem, saith the Lord, as if the children of Israel should bring an offering in a clean vessel into the house of the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:21">66:21</a> And I will take of them to be priests, and Levites, saith the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:22">66:22</a> For as the new heavens, and the new earth, which I will make to stand before me, saith the Lord: so shall your seed stand, and your name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:23">66:23</a> And there shall be month after month, and sabbath after sabbath: and all flesh shall come to adore before my face, saith the Lord. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:24">66:24</a> And they shall go out, and see the carcasses of the men that have transgressed against me: their worm shah not die, and their fire shall not be quenched: and they shall be a loathsome sight to all flesh.</p>
