  <h3 align="center">American Standard Version: Nehemiah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The words of Nehemiah the son of Hacaliah. Now it came to pass in the month Chislev, in the twentieth year, as I was in Shushan the palace,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> that Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men out of Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped, that were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the captivity there in the province are in great affliction and reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the gates thereof are burned with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down and wept, and mourned certain days; and I fasted and prayed before the God of heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> and said, I beseech thee, O Jehovah, the God of heaven, the great and terrible God, that keepeth covenant and lovingkindness with them that love him and keep his commandments:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou mayest hearken unto the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before thee at this time, day and night, for the children of Israel thy servants while I confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against thee. Yea, I and my father's house have sinned:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> we have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the ordinances, which thou commandedst thy servant Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy servant Moses, saying, If ye trespass, I will scatter you abroad among the peoples:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> but if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your outcasts were in the uttermost part of the heavens, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen, to cause my name to dwell there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> O Lord, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who delight to fear thy name; and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. Now I was cupbearer to the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes the king, when wine was before him, that I took up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been [beforetime] sad in his presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad, seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of heart. Then I was very sore afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And I said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are consumed with fire?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request? So I prayed to the God of heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy servant have found favor in thy sight, that thou wouldest send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres, that I may build it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And the king said unto me (the queen also sitting by him,) For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return? So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let letters be given me to the governors beyond the River, that they may let me pass through till I come unto Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the castle which appertaineth to the house, and for the wall of the city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Then I came to the governors beyond the River, and gave them the king's letters. Now the king had sent with me captains of the army and horsemen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly, for that there was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither told I any man what my God put into my heart to do for Jerusalem; neither was there any beast with me, save the beast that I rode upon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And I went out by night by the valley gate, even toward the jackal's well, and to the dung gate, and viewed the walls of Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were consumed with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Then I went on to the fountain gate and to the king's pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me to pass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall; and I turned back, and entered by the valley gate, and so returned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Then said I unto them, Ye see the evil case that we are in, how Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we be no more a reproach.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me, as also of the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their hands for the good [work].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye do? will ye rebel against the king?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven, he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it, and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Hammeah they sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them builded Zaccur the son of Imri.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah, the son of Hakkoz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah, the son of Meshezabel. And next unto them repaired Zadok the son of Baana.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put not their necks to the work of their lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And the old gate repaired Joiada the son of Paseah and Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, and the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, [that appertained] to the throne of the governor beyond the River.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, goldsmiths. And next unto him repaired Hananiah one of the perfumers, and they fortified Jerusalem even unto the broad wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the son of Hashabneiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hasshub the son of Pahath-moab, repaired another portion, and the tower of the furnaces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Hallohesh, the ruler of half the district of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah; they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits of the wall unto the dung gate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And the dung gate repaired Malchijah the son of Rechab, the ruler of the district of Beth-haccherem; he built it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And the fountain gate repaired Shallun the son of Colhozeh, the ruler of the district of Mizpah; he built it, and covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the bolts thereof, and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Shelah by the king's garden, even unto the stairs that go down from the city of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of half the district of Beth-zur, unto the place over against the sepulchres of David, and unto the pool that was made, and unto the house of the mighty men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of half the district of Keilah, for his district.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> After him repaired their brethren, Bavvai the son of Henadad, the ruler of half the district of Keilah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of Mizpah, another portion, over against the ascent to the armory at the turning [of the wall].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired another portion, from the turning [of the wall] unto the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> After him repaired Meremoth the son of Uriah the son of Hakkoz another portion, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to the end of the house of Eliashib.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> And after him repaired the priests, the men of the Plain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> After them repaired Benjamin and Hasshub over against their house. After them repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son of Ananiah beside his own house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another portion, from the house of Azariah unto the turning [of the wall], and unto the corner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Palal the son of Uzai [repaired] over against the turning [of the wall], and the tower that standeth out from the upper house of the king, which is by the court of the guard. After him Pedaiah the son of Parosh [repaired].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> (Now the Nethinim dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that standeth out.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:27">3:27</a> After him the Tekoites repaired another portion, over against the great tower that standeth out, and unto the wall of Ophel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:28">3:28</a> Above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over against his own house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:29">3:29</a> After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his own house. And after him repaired Shemaiah the son of Shecaniah, the keeper of the east gate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:30">3:30</a> After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun the sixth son of Zalaph, another portion. After him repaired Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:31">3:31</a> After him repaired Malchijah one of the goldsmiths unto the house of the Nethinim, and of the merchants, over against the gate of Hammiphkad, and to the ascent of the corner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:32">3:32</a> And between the ascent of the corner and the sheep gate repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> But it came to pass that, when Sanballat heard that we were building the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked the Jews.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and said, What are these feeble Jews doing? will they fortify themselves? will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they revive the stones out of the heaps of rubbish, seeing they are burned?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that which they are building, if a fox go up, he shall break down their stone wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn back their reproach upon their own head, and give them up for a spoil in a land of captivity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> and cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted out from before thee; for they have provoked [thee] to anger before the builders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> So we built the wall; and all the wall was joined together unto half [the height] thereof: for the people had a mind to work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> But it came to pass that, when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that the repairing of the walls of Jerusalem went forward, [and] that the breaches began to be stopped, then they were very wroth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> and they conspired all of them together to come and fight against Jerusalem, and to cause confusion therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> But we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch against them day and night, because of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to build the wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see, till we come into the midst of them, and slay them, and cause the work to cease.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And it came to pass that, when the Jews that dwelt by them came, they said unto us ten times from all places, Ye must return unto us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> Therefore set I in the lowest parts of the space behind the wall, in the open places, I set [there] the people after their families with their swords, their spears, and their bows.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of them: remember the Lord, who is great and terrible, and fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your wives, and your houses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And it came to pass from that time forth, that half of my servants wrought in the work, and half of them held the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the coats of mail; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> They all builded the wall and they that bare burdens laded themselves; every one with one of his hands wrought in the work, and with the other held his weapon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> and the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side, and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers and to the rest of the people, The work is great and large, and we are separated upon the wall, one far from another:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> in what place soever ye hear the sound of the trumpet, resort ye thither unto us; our God will fight for us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> So we wrought in the work: and half of them held the spears from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night they may be a guard to us, and may labor in the day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of the guard that followed me, none of us put off our clothes, every one [went with] his weapon [to] the water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Then there arose a great cry of the people and of their wives against their brethren the Jews.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> For there were that said, We, our sons and our daughters, are many: let us get grain, that we may eat and live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> Some also there were that said, We are mortgaging our fields, and our vineyards, and our houses: let us get grain, because of the dearth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the king's tribute [upon] our fields and our vineyards.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our daughters are brought into bondage [already]: neither is it in our power to help it; for other men have our fields and our vineyards.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Then I consulted with myself, and contended with the nobles and the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of his brother. And I held a great assembly against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our brethren the Jews, that were sold unto the nations; and would ye even sell your brethren, and should they be sold unto us? Then held they their peace, and found never a word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Also I said, The thing that ye do is not good: ought ye not to walk in the fear of our God, because of the reproach of the nations our enemies?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And I likewise, my brethren and my servants, do lend them money and grain. I pray you, let us leave off this usury.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their fields, their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the hundredth part of the money, and of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, that ye exact of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing of them; so will we do, even as thou sayest. Then I called the priests, and took an oath of them, that they would do according to this promise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Also I shook out my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from his house, and from his labor, that performeth not this promise; even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the assembly said, Amen, and praised Jehovah. And the people did according to this promise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, [that is], twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread of the governor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> But the former governors that were before me were chargeable unto the people, and took of them bread and wine, besides forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the fear of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto the work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> Moreover there were at my table, of the Jews and the rulers, a hundred and fifty men, besides those that came unto us from among the nations that were round about us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Now that which was prepared for one day was one ox and six choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this I demanded not the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy upon this people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> Remember unto me, O my God, for good, all that I have done for this people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Now it came to pass, when it was reported to Sanballat and Tobiah, and to Geshem the Arabian, and unto the rest of our enemies, that I had builded the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though even unto that time I had not set up the doors in the gates;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> that Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us meet together in [one of] the villages in the plain of Ono. But they thought to do me mischief.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease, whilst I leave it, and come down to you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I answered them after the same manner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the fifth time with an open letter in his hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> wherein was written, It is reported among the nations, and Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel; for which cause thou art building the wall: and thou wouldest be their king, according to these words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it be reported to the king according to these words. Come now therefore, and let us take counsel together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> For they all would have made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be weakened from the work, that it be not done. But now, [O God], strengthen thou my hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And I went unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah the son of Mehetabel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there, that, being such as I, would go into the temple to save his life? I will not go in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And I discerned, and, lo, God had not sent him; but he pronounced this prophecy against me: and Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> For this cause was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so, and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report, that they might reproach me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> Remember, O my God, Tobiah and Sanballat according to these their works, and also the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth [day] of [the month] Elul, in fifty and two days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> And it came to pass, when all our enemies heard [thereof], that all the nations that were about us feared, and were much cast down in their own eyes; for they perceived that this work was wrought of our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters unto Tobiah, and [the letters] of Tobiah came unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was the son-in-law of Shecaniah the son of Arah; and his son Jehohanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of Berechiah to wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> Also they spake of his good deeds before me, and reported my words to him. [And] Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites were appointed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> that I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the governor of the castle, charge over Jerusalem; for he was a faithful man, and feared God above many.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened until the sun be hot; and while they stand [on guard], let them shut the doors, and bar ye them: and appoint watches of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every one [to be] over against his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> Now the city was wide and large; but the people were few therein, and the houses were not builded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And my God put into my heart to gather together the nobles, and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by genealogy. And I found the book of the genealogy of them that came up at the first, and I found written therein:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> These are the children of the province, that went up out of the captivity of those that had been carried away, whom Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and that returned unto Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:64">7:64</a> These sought their register [among] those that were reckoned by genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they deemed polluted and put from the priesthood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:65">7:65</a> And the governor said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and Thummim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:66">7:66</a> The whole assembly together was forty and two thousand three hundred and threescore,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:67">7:67</a> besides their men-servants and their maid-servants, of whom there were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:69">7:69</a> [their] camels, four hundred thirty and five; [their] asses, six thousand seven hundred and twenty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:70">7:70</a> And some from among the heads of fathers' [houses] gave unto the work. The governor gave to the treasury a thousand darics of gold, fifty basins, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:71">7:71</a> And some of the heads of fathers' [houses] gave into the treasury of the work twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand and two hundred pounds of silver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:72">7:72</a> And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand darics of gold, and two thousand pounds of silver, and threescore and seven priests' garments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:73">7:73</a> So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinim, and all Israel, dwelt in their cities. And when the seventh month was come, the children of Israel were in their cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And all the people gathered themselves together as one man into the broad place that was before the water gate; and they spake unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses, which Jehovah had commanded to Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And Ezra the priest brought the law before the assembly, both men and women, and all that could hear with understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And he read therein before the broad place that was before the water gate from early morning until midday, in the presence of the men and the women, and of those that could understand; and the ears of all the people were [attentive] unto the book of the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and Shema, and Anaiah, and Uriah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael, and Malchijah, and Hashum, and Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, [and] Meshullam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the people stood up:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> and Ezra blessed Jehovah, the great God. And all the people answered, Amen, Amen, with the lifting up of their hands: and they bowed their heads, and worshipped Jehovah with their faces to the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to understand the law: and the people [stood] in their place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And they read in the book, in the law of God, distinctly; and they gave the sense, so that they understood the reading.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And Nehemiah, who was the governor, and Ezra the priest the scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all the people, This day is holy unto Jehovah your God; mourn not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the words of the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink the sweet, and send portions unto him for whom nothing is prepared; for this day is holy unto our Lord: neither be ye grieved; for the joy of Jehovah is your strength.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had understood the words that were declared unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And on the second day were gathered together the heads of fathers' [houses] of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto Ezra the scribe, even to give attention to the words of the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And they found written in the law, how that Jehovah had commanded by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths in the feast of the seventh month;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> and that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities, and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch olive branches, and branches of wild olive, and myrtle branches, and palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as it is written.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> So the people went forth, and brought them, and made themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in the broad place of the water gate, and in the broad place of the gate of Ephraim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And all the assembly of them that were come again out of the captivity made booths, and dwelt in the booths; for since the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according unto the ordinance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackcloth, and earth upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners, and stood and confessed their sins, and the iniquities of their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the law of Jehovah their God a fourth part of the day; and [another] fourth part they confessed, and worshipped Jehovah their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Then stood up upon the stairs of the Levites, Jeshua, and Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, [and] Chenani, and cried with a loud voice unto Jehovah their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, [and] Pethahiah, said, Stand up and bless Jehovah your God from everlasting to everlasting; and blessed be thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and praise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Thou art Jehovah, even thou alone; thou hast made heaven, the heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth and all things that are thereon, the seas and all that is in them, and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven worshippeth thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Thou art Jehovah the God, who didst choose Abram, and broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him the name of Abraham,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> and foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite, and the Girgashite, to give it unto his seed, and hast performed thy words; for thou art righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And thou sawest the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and heardest their cry by the Red Sea,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> and showedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his servants, and on all the people of his land; for thou knewest that they dealt proudly against them, and didst get thee a name, as it is this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their pursuers thou didst cast into the depths, as a stone into the mighty waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> Moreover in a pillar of cloud thou leddest them by day; and in a pillar of fire by night, to give them light in the way wherein they should go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them from heaven, and gavest them right ordinances and true laws, good statutes and commandments,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> and madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst them commandments, and statutes, and a law, by Moses thy servant,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> and gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their thirst, and commandedst them that they should go in to possess the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> But they and our fathers dealt proudly and hardened their neck, and hearkened not to thy commandments,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> and refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that thou didst among them, but hardened their neck, and in their rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage. But thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, and forsookest them not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought great provocations;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the wilderness: the pillar of cloud departed not from over them by day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by night, to show them light, and the way wherein they should go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Thou gavest also thy good Spirit to instruct them, and withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them water for their thirst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, [and] they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and their feet swelled not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and peoples, which thou didst allot after their portions: so they possessed the land of Sihon, even the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king of Bashan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven, and broughtest them into the land concerning which thou didst say to their fathers, that they should go in to possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their kings, and the peoples of the land, that they might do with them as they would.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And they took fortified cities, and a fat land, and possessed houses full of all good things, cisterns hewn out, vineyards, and oliveyards, and fruit-trees in abundance: so they did eat, and were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy great goodness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee, and cast thy law behind their back, and slew thy prophets that testified against them to turn them again unto thee, and they wrought great provocations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their adversaries, who distressed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours who saved them out of the hand of their adversaries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee; therefore leftest thou them in the hand of their enemies, so that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned, and cried unto thee, thou heardest from heaven; and many times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> and testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them again unto thy law. Yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not unto thy commandments, but sinned against thine ordinances, (which if a man do, he shall live in them,) and withdrew the shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> Yet many years didst thou bear with them, and testifiedst against them by thy Spirit through thy prophets: yet would they not give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the peoples of the lands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> Nevertheless in thy manifold mercies thou didst not make a full end of them, nor forsake them; for thou art a gracious and merciful God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:32">9:32</a> Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who keepest covenant and lovingkindness, let not all the travail seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:33">9:33</a> Howbeit thou art just in all that is come upon us; for thou hast dealt truly, but we have done wickedly;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:34">9:34</a> neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and thy testimonies wherewith thou didst testify against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:35">9:35</a> For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from their wicked works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:36">9:36</a> Behold, we are servants this day, and as for the land that thou gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good thereof, behold, we are servants in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:37">9:37</a> And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast set over us because of our sins: also they have power over our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:38">9:38</a> And yet for all this we make a sure covenant, and write it; and our princes, our Levites, [and] our priests, seal unto it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Now those that sealed were: Nehemiah the governor, the son of Hacaliah, and Zedekiah,</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub, were porters keeping the watch at the store-houses of the gates.</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:27">12:27</a> And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem, to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings, and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both out of the plain round about Jerusalem, and from the villages of the Netophathites;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:29">12:29</a> also from Beth-gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round about Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:30">12:30</a> And the priests and the Levites purified themselves; and they purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:31">12:31</a> Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and appointed two great companies that gave thanks and went in procession; [whereof one went] on the right hand upon the wall toward the dung gate:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:32">12:32</a> and after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of Judah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:33">12:33</a> and Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:34">12:34</a> Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:35">12:35</a> and certain of the priests' sons with trumpets: Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:36">12:36</a> and his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical instruments of David the man of God; and Ezra the scribe was before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:37">12:37</a> And by the fountain gate, and straight before them, they went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the ascent of the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate eastward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:38">12:38</a> And the other company of them that gave thanks went to meet them, and I after them, with the half of the people, upon the wall, above the tower of the furnaces, even unto the broad wall,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:39">12:39</a> and above the gate of Ephraim, and by the old gate, and by the fish gate, and the tower of Hananel, and the tower of Hammeah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still in the gate of the guard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:40">12:40</a> So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:41">12:41</a> and the priests, Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:42">12:42</a> and Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:43">12:43</a> And they offered great sacrifices that day, and rejoiced; for God had made them rejoice with great joy; and the women also and the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard even afar off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:44">12:44</a> And on that day were men appointed over the chambers for the treasures, for the heave-offerings, for the first-fruits, and for the tithes, to gather into them, according to the fields of the cities, the portions appointed by the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:45">12:45</a> And they kept the charge of their God, and the charge of the purification, and [so did] the singers and the porters, according to the commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:46">12:46</a> For in the days of David and Asaph of old there was a chief of the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:47">12:47</a> And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters, as every day required: and they set apart [that which was] for the Levites; and the Levites set apart [that which was] for the sons of Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of the people; and therein was found written, that an Ammonite and a Moabite should not enter into the assembly of God for ever,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> because they met not the children of Israel with bread and with water, but hired Balaam against them, to curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Now before this, Eliashib the priest, who was appointed over the chambers of the house of our God, being allied unto Tobiah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime they laid the meal-offerings, the frankincense, and the vessels, and the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil, which were given by commandment to the Levites, and the singers, and the porters; and the heave-offerings for the priests.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> But in all this [time] I was not at Jerusalem; for in the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon I went unto the king: and after certain days asked I leave of the king,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> and I came to Jerusalem, and understood the evil that Eliashib had done for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the courts of the house of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the household stuff of Tobiah out of the chamber.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meal-offerings and the frankincense.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been given them; so that the Levites and the singers, that did the work, were fled every one to his field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in their place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> Then brought all Judah the tithe of the grain and the new wine and the oil unto the treasuries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of Mattaniah; for they were counted faithful, and their business was to distribute unto their brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for the observances thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> In those days saw I in Judah some men treading wine-presses on the sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses [therewith]; as also wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified [against them] in the day wherein they sold victuals.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, who brought in fish, and all manner of wares, and sold on the sabbath unto the children of Judah, and in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them, What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon Israel by profaning the sabbath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And it came to pass that, when the gates of Jerusalem began to be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the doors should be shut, and commanded that they should not be opened till after the sabbath: and some of my servants set I over the gates, that there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> So the merchants and sellers of all kind of wares lodged without Jerusalem once or twice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you. From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And I commanded the Levites that they should purify themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to sanctify the sabbath day. Remember unto me, O my God, this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy lovingkindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> In those days also saw I the Jews that had married women of Ashdod, of Ammon, [and] of Moab:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> and their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the language of each people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by God, [saying], Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons, nor take their daughters for your sons, or for yourselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among many nations was there no king like him, and he was beloved of his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless even him did foreign women cause to sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to trespass against our God in marrying foreign women?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high priest, was son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I chased him from me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the Levites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> Thus cleansed I them from all foreigners, and appointed charges for the priests and for the Levites, every one in his work;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> and for the wood-offering, at times appointed, and for the first-fruits. Remember me, O my God, for good. </p>
