  <h3 align="center">American Standard Version: Philippians</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus that are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> I thank my God upon all my remembrance of you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> always in every supplication of mine on behalf of you all making my supplication with joy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> for your fellowship in furtherance of the gospel from the first day until now;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> being confident of this very thing, that he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Jesus Christ:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> even as it is right for me to be thus minded on behalf of you all, because I have you in my heart, inasmuch as, both in my bonds and in the defence and confirmation of the gospel, ye all are partakers with me of grace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> For God is my witness, how I long after you all in the tender mercies of Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And this I pray, that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and all discernment;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> so that ye may approve the things that are excellent; that ye may be sincere and void of offence unto the day of Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> being filled with the fruits of righteousness, which are through Jesus Christ, unto the glory and praise of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Now I would have you know, brethren, that the things [which happened] unto me have fallen out rather unto the progress of the gospel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> so that my bonds became manifest in Christ throughout the whole praetorian guard, and to all the rest;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and that most of the brethren in the Lord, being confident through my bonds, are more abundantly bold to speak the word of God without fear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> Some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife; and some also of good will:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> the one [do it] of love, knowing that I am set for the defence of the gospel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> but the other proclaim Christ of faction, not sincerely, thinking to raise up affliction for me in my bonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> What then? only that in every way, whether in pretence or in truth, Christ is proclaimed; and therein I rejoice, yea, and will rejoice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> For I know that this shall turn out to my salvation, through your supplication and the supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> according to my earnest expectation and hope, that in nothing shall I be put to shame, but [that] with all boldness, as always, [so] now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether by life, or by death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> But if to live in the flesh, --[if] this shall bring fruit from my work, then what I shall choose I know not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> But I am in a strait betwixt the two, having the desire to depart and be with Christ; for it is very far better:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> yet to abide in the flesh is more needful for your sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And having this confidence, I know that I shall abide, yea, and abide with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> that your glorying may abound in Christ Jesus in me through my presence with you again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ: that, whether I come and see you and be absent, I may hear of your state, that ye stand fast in one spirit, with one soul striving for the faith of the gospel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> and in nothing affrighted by the adversaries: which is for them an evident token of perdition, but of your salvation, and that from God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> because to you it hath been granted in the behalf of Christ, not only to believe on him, but also to suffer in his behalf:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> having the same conflict which ye saw in me, and now hear to be in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> If there is therefore any exhortation in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any tender mercies and compassions,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> make full my joy, that ye be of the same mind, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> [doing] nothing through faction or through vainglory, but in lowliness of mind each counting other better than himself;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> not looking each of you to his own things, but each of you also to the things of others.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Have this mind in you, which was also in Christ Jesus:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> who, existing in the form of God, counted not the being on an equality with God a thing to be grasped,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> but emptied himself, taking the form of a servant, being made in the likeness of men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and being found in fashion as a man, he humbled himself, becoming obedient [even] unto death, yea, the death of the cross.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Wherefore also God highly exalted him, and gave unto him the name which is above every name;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of [things] in heaven and [things] on earth and [things] under the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> So then, my beloved, even as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> for it is God who worketh in you both to will and to work, for his good pleasure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Do all things without murmurings and questionings:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> that ye may become blameless and harmless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom ye are seen as lights in the world,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> holding forth the word of life; that I may have whereof to glory in the day of Christ, that I did not run in vain neither labor in vain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Yea, and if I am offered upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, I joy, and rejoice with you all:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> and in the same manner do ye also joy, and rejoice with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy shortly unto you, that I also may be of good comfort, when I know your state.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> For I have no man likeminded, who will care truly for your state.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> For they all seek their own, not the things of Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> But ye know the proof of him, that, as a child [serveth] a father, [so] he served with me in furtherance of the gospel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> Him therefore I hope to send forthwith, so soon as I shall see how it will go with me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> but I trust in the Lord that I myself also shall come shortly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> But I counted it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus, my brother and fellow-worker and fellow-soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> since he longed after you all, and was sore troubled, because ye had heard that he was sick:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> for indeed he was sick nigh unto death: but God had mercy on him; and not on him only, but on me also, that I might not have sorrow upon sorrow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> I have sent him therefore the more diligently, that, when ye see him again, ye may rejoice, and that I may be the less sorrowful.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> Receive him therefore in the Lord with all joy; and hold such in honor:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> because for the work of Christ he came nigh unto death, hazarding his life to supply that which was lacking in your service toward me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Finally, my brethren, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you, to me indeed is not irksome, but for you it is safe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the concision:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> for we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God, and glory in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> though I myself might have confidence even in the flesh: if any other man thinketh to have confidence in the flesh, I yet more:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as touching the law, a Pharisee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> as touching zeal, persecuting the church; as touching the righteousness which is in the law, found blameless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Howbeit what things were gain to me, these have I counted loss for Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Yea verily, and I count all things to be loss for the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord: for whom I suffered the loss of all things, and do count them but refuse, that I may gain Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> and be found in him, not having a righteousness of mine own, [even] that which is of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> that I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, becoming conformed unto his death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> if by any means I may attain unto the resurrection from the dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Not that I have already obtained, or am already made perfect: but I press on, if so be that I may lay hold on that for which also I was laid hold on by Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Brethren, I could not myself yet to have laid hold: but one thing [I do], forgetting the things which are behind, and stretching forward to the things which are before,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> I press on toward the goal unto the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> Let us therefore, as many as are perfect, be thus minded: and if in anything ye are otherwise minded, this also shall God reveal unto you:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> only, whereunto we have attained, by that same [rule] let us walk.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> Brethren, be ye imitators together of me, and mark them that so walk even as ye have us for an ensample.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> For many walk, of whom I told you often, and now tell you even weeping, [that they are] the enemies of the cross of Christ:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> whose end is perdition, whose god is the belly, and [whose] glory is in their shame, who mind earthly things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> For our citizenship is in heaven; whence also we wait for a Saviour, the Lord Jesus Christ:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> who shall fashion anew the body of our humiliation, [that it may be] conformed to the body of his glory, according to the working whereby he is able even to subject all things unto himself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Wherefore, my brethren beloved and longed for, my joy and crown, so stand fast in the Lord, my beloved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> I exhort Euodia, and I exhort Syntyche, to be of the same mind in the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> Yea, I beseech thee also, true yokefellow, help these women, for they labored with me in the gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow-workers, whose names are in the book of life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Rejoice in the Lord always: again I will say, Rejoice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Let your forbearance be known unto all men. The Lord is at hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> In nothing be anxious; but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, whatsoever things are honorable, whatsoever things are just, whatsoever things are pure, whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any praise, think on these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> The things which ye both learned and received and heard and saw in me, these things do: and the God of peace shall be with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> But I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at length ye have revived your thought for me; wherein ye did indeed take thought, but ye lacked opportunity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> Not that I speak in respect of want: for I have learned, in whatsoever state I am, therein to be content.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> I know how to be abased, and I know also how to abound: in everything and in all things have I learned the secret both to be filled and to be hungry, both to abound and to be in want.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> I can do all things in him that strengtheneth me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Howbeit ye did well that ye had fellowship with my affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And ye yourselves also know, ye Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I departed from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the matter of giving and receiving but ye only;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> for even in Thessalonica ye sent once and again unto my need.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> Not that I seek for the gift; but I seek for the fruit that increaseth to your account.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> But I have all things, and abound: I am filled, having received from Epaphroditus the things [that came] from you, and odor of a sweet smell, a sacrifice acceptable, well-pleasing to God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And my God shall supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> Now unto our God and Father [be] the glory for ever and ever. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> Salute every saint in Christ Jesus. The brethren that are with me salute you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> All the saints salute you, especially they that are of Caesar's household.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. </p>
