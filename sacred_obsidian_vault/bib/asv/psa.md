  <h3 align="center">American Standard Version: Psalms</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the wicked, Nor standeth in the way of sinners, Nor sitteth in the seat of scoffers:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> But his delight is in the law of Jehovah; And on his law doth he meditate day and night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And he shall be like a tree planted by the streams of water, That bringeth forth its fruit in its season, Whose leaf also doth not wither; And whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> The wicked are not so, But are like the chaff which the wind driveth away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Therefore the wicked shall not stand in the judgment, Nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> For Jehovah knoweth the way of the righteous; But the way of the wicked shall perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Why do the nations rage, And the peoples meditate a vain thing?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> The kings of the earth set themselves, And the rulers take counsel together, Against Jehovah, and against his anointed, [saying],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Let us break their bonds asunder, And cast away their cords from us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> He that sitteth in the heavens will laugh: The Lord will have them in derision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Then will he speak unto them in his wrath, And vex them in his sore displeasure:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Yet I have set my king Upon my holy hill of Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> I will tell of the decree: Jehovah said unto me, Thou art my son; This day have I begotten thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Ask of me, and I will give [thee] the nations for thine inheritance, And the uttermost parts of the earth for thy possession.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; Thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Now therefore be wise, O ye kings: Be instructed, ye judges of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Serve Jehovah with fear, And rejoice with trembling.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Kiss the son, lest he be angry, and ye perish in the way, For his wrath will soon be kindled. Blessed are all they that take refuge in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son. Jehovah, how are mine adversaries increased! Many are they that rise up against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Many there are that say of my soul, There is no help for him in God. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> But thou, O Jehovah, art a shield about me; My glory and the lifter up of my head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> I cry unto Jehovah with my voice, And he answereth me out of his holy hill. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for Jehovah sustaineth me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> I will not be afraid of ten thousands of the people That have set themselves against me round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Arise, O Jehovah; save me, O my God: For thou hast smitten all mine enemies upon the cheek bone; Thou hast broken the teeth of the wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Salvation belongeth unto Jehovah: Thy blessing be upon thy people. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of David. Answer me when I call, O God of my righteousness; Thou hast set me at large [when I was] in distress: Have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> O ye sons of men, how long shall my glory be turned into dishonor? [How long] will ye love vanity, and seek after falsehood? Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> But know that Jehovah hath set apart for himself him that is godly: Jehovah will hear when I call unto him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Stand in awe, and sin not: Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, And put your trust in Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Many there are that say, Who will show us [any] good? Jehovah, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Thou hast put gladness in my heart, More than [they have] when their grain and their new wine are increased.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> In peace will I both lay me down and sleep; For thou, Jehovah, alone makest me dwell in safety.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> For the Chief Musician; with the Nehiloth. A Psalm of David. Give ear to my words, O Jehovah, Consider my meditation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God; For unto thee do I pray.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> O Jehovah, in the morning shalt thou hear my voice; In the morning will I order [my prayer] unto thee, and will keep watch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: Evil shall not sojourn with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> The arrogant shall not stand in thy sight: Thou hatest all workers of iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Thou wilt destroy them that speak lies: Jehovah abhorreth the blood-thirsty and deceitful man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> But as for me, in the abundance of thy lovingkindness will I come into thy house: In thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Lead me, O Jehovah, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; Make thy way straight before my face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; Their inward part is very wickedness; Their throat is an open sepulchre; They flatter with their tongue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Hold them guilty, O God; Let them fall by their own counsels; Thrust them out in the multitude of their transgressions; For they have rebelled against thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> But let all those that take refuge in thee rejoice, Let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: Let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> For thou wilt bless the righteous; O Jehovah, thou wilt compass him with favor as with a shield.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments, set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, rebuke me not in thine anger, Neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; for I am withered away: O Jehovah, heal me; for my bones are troubled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> My soul also is sore troubled: And thou, O Jehovah, how long?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Return, O Jehovah, deliver my soul: Save me for thy lovingkindness' sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> For in death there is no remembrance of thee: In Sheol who shall give thee thanks?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> I am weary with my groaning; Every night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> Mine eye wasteth away because of grief; It waxeth old because of all mine adversaries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For Jehovah hath heard the voice of my weeping.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> Jehovah hath heard my supplication; Jehovah will receive my prayer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> All mine enemies shall be put to shame and sore troubled: They shall turn back, they shall be put to shame suddenly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto Jehova, concerning the words of Cush a Benjamite. O Jehovah my God, in thee do I take refuge: Save me from all them that pursue me, and deliver me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> Lest they tear my soul like a lion, Rending it in pieces, while there is none to deliver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> O Jehovah my God, if I have done this; If there be iniquity in my hands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (Yea, I have delivered him that without cause was mine adversary;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Let the enemy pursue my soul, and overtake it; Yea, let him tread my life down to the earth, And lay my glory in the dust. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Arise, O Jehovah, in thine anger; Lift up thyself against the rage of mine adversaries, And awake for me; thou hast commanded judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> And let the congregation of the peoples compass thee about; And over them return thou on high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Jehovah ministereth judgment to the peoples: Judge me, O Jehovah, according to my righteousness, and to mine integrity that is in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> O let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end, but establish thou the righteous: For the righteous God trieth the minds and hearts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> My shield is with God, Who saveth the upright in heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> God is a righteous judge, Yea, a God that hath indignation every day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> If a man turn not, he will whet his sword; He hath bent his bow, and made it ready.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; He maketh his arrows fiery [shafts].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Behold, he travaileth with iniquity; Yea, he hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> He hath made a pit, and digged it, And is fallen into the ditch which he made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> His mischief shall return upon his own head, And his violence shall come down upon his own pate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> I will give thanks unto Jehovah according to his righteousness, And will sing praise to the name of Jehovah Most High.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> For the Chief Musician; set to the Gittith. A Psalm of David. O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth, Who hast set thy glory upon the heavens!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou established strength, Because of thine adversaries, That thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, The moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> What is man, that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that thou visitest him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> For thou hast made him but little lower than God, And crownest him with glory and honor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Thou makest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; Thou hast put all things under his feet:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> All sheep and oxen, Yea, and the beasts of the field,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> The birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, Whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> O Jehovah, our Lord, How excellent is thy name in all the earth!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> For the Chief Musician; set to Muthlabben. A Psalm of David. I will give thanks unto Jehovah with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> I will be glad and exult in thee; I will sing praise to thy name, O thou Most High.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> When mine enemies turn back, They stumble and perish at thy presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; Thou sittest in the throne judging righteously.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked; Thou hast blotted out their name for ever and ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> The enemy are come to an end, they are desolate for ever; And the cities which thou hast overthrown, The very remembrance of them is perished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> But Jehovah sitteth [as king] for ever: He hath prepared his throne for judgment;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And he will judge the world in righteousness, He will minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> Jehovah also will be a high tower for the oppressed, A high tower in times of trouble;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee; For thou, Jehovah, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> Sing praises to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion: Declare among the people his doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> For he that maketh inquisition for blood remembereth them; He forgetteth not the cry of the poor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah; Behold my affliction [which I suffer] of them that hate me, Thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> That I may show forth all thy praise. In the gates of the daughter of Zion I will rejoice in thy salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> The nations are sunk down in the pit that they made: In the net which they hid is their own foot taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> Jehovah hath made himself known, he hath executed judgment: The wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> The wicked shall be turned back unto Sheol, Even all the nations that forget God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> For the needy shall not alway be forgotten, Nor the expectation of the poor perish for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> Arise, O Jehovah; let not man prevail: Let the nations be judged in thy sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Put them in fear, O Jehovah: Let the nations know themselves to be but men. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Why standest thou afar off, O Jehovah? Why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> In the pride of the wicked the poor is hotly pursued; Let them be taken in the devices that they have conceived.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, And the covetous renounceth, [yea], contemneth Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> The wicked, in the pride of his countenance, [saith], He will not require [it]. All his thoughts are, There is no God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> His ways are firm at all times; Thy judgments are far above out of his sight: As for all his adversaries, he puffeth at them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> He saith in his heart, I shall not be moved; To all generations I shall not be in adversity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and oppression: Under his tongue is mischief and iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> He sitteth in the lurking-places of the villages; In the secret places doth he murder the innocent; His eyes are privily set against the helpless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> He lurketh in secret as a lion in his covert; He lieth in wait to catch the poor: He doth catch the poor, when he draweth him in his net.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> He croucheth, he boweth down, And the helpless fall by his strong ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> He saith in his heart, God hath forgotten; He hideth his face; he will never see it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> Arise, O Jehovah; O God, lift up thy hand: Forget not the poor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God, And say in his heart, Thou wilt not require [it]?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> Thou hast seen [it]; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand: The helpless committeth [himself] unto thee; Thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> Break thou the arm of the wicked; And as for the evil man, seek out his wickedness till thou find none.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Jehovah is King for ever and ever: The nations are perished out of his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> Jehovah, thou hast heard the desire of the meek: Thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, That man who is of the earth may be terrible no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. In Jehovah do I take refuge: How say ye to my soul, Flee [as] a bird to your mountain;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> For, lo, the wicked bend the bow, They make ready their arrow upon the string, That they may shoot in darkness at the upright in heart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> If the foundations be destroyed, What can the righteous do?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> Jehovah is in his holy temple; Jehovah, his throne is in heaven; His eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> Jehovah trieth the righteous; But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> Upon the wicked he will rain snares; Fire and brimstone and burning wind shall be the portion of their cup.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> For Jehovah is righteous; he loveth righteousness: The upright shall behold his face.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> For the Chief Musician; set to the Sheminith. A Psalm of David. Help, Jehovah; for the godly man ceaseth; For the faithful fail from among the children of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> They speak falsehood every one with his neighbor: With flattering lip, and with a double heart, do they speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> Jehovah will cut off all flattering lips, The tongue that speaketh great things;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; Our lips are our own: who is lord over us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Because of the oppression of the poor, because of the sighing of the needy, Now will I arise, saith Jehovah; I will set him in the safety he panteth for.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> The words of Jehovah are pure words; As silver tried in a furnace on the earth, Purified seven times.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> Thou wilt keep them, O Jehovah, Thou wilt preserve them from this generation for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> The wicked walk on every side, When vileness is exalted among the sons of men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou hide thy face from me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> How long shall I take counsel in my soul, Having sorrow in my heart all the day? How long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> Consider [and] answer me, O Jehovah my God: Lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the [sleep of] death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; [Lest] mine adversaries rejoice when I am moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> But I have trusted in thy lovingkindness; My heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> I will sing unto Jehovah, Because he hath dealt bountifully with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> For the Chief Musician. [A Psalm] of David. The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works; There is none that doeth good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> Jehovah looked down from heaven upon the children of men, To see if there were any that did understand, That did seek after God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> They are all gone aside; they are together become filthy; There is none that doeth good, no, not one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge, Who eat up my people [as] they eat bread, And call not upon Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> There were they in great fear; For God is in the generation of the righteous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> Ye put to shame the counsel of the poor, Because Jehovah is his refuge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When Jehovah bringeth back the captivity of his people, Then shall Jacob rejoice, [and] Israel shall be glad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> A Psalm of David. Jehovah, who shall sojourn in thy tabernacle? Who shall dwell in thy holy hill?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, And speaketh truth in his heart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> He that slandereth not with his tongue, Nor doeth evil to his friend, Nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbor;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> In whose eyes a reprobate is despised, But who honoreth them that fear Jehovah; He that sweareth to his own hurt, and changeth not;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> He that putteth not out his money to interest, Nor taketh reward against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never be moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> Michtam of David. Preserve me, O God; for in thee do I take refuge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> [O my soul], thou hast said unto Jehovah, Thou art my Lord: I have no good beyond thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> As for the saints that are in the earth, They are the excellent in whom is all my delight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> Their sorrows shall be multiplied that give gifts for another [god]: Their drink-offerings of blood will I not offer, Nor take their names upon my lips.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> Jehovah is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup: Thou maintainest my lot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; Yea, I have a goodly heritage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> I will bless Jehovah, who hath given me counsel; Yea, my heart instructeth me in the night seasons.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> He made darkness his hiding-place, his pavilion round about him, Darkness of waters, thick clouds of the skies.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> Then the channels of waters appeared, And the foundations of the world were laid bare, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah, At the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me out of many waters.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:42">18:42</a> Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind; I did cast them out as the mire of the streets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:43">18:43</a> Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; Thou hast made me the head of the nations: A people whom I have not known shall serve me.</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together: The abjects gathered themselves together against me, and I knew [it] not; They did tear me, and ceased not:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a> Like the profane mockers in feasts, They gnashed upon me with their teeth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:17">35:17</a> Lord, how long wilt thou look on? Rescue my soul from their destructions, My darling from the lions.</p>

 <p><a name="an_35:21">35:21</a> Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me; They said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:6">38:6</a> I am pained and bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> I am faint and sore bruised: I have groaned by reason of the disquietness of my heart.</p>

 <p><a name="an_39:3">39:3</a> My heart was hot within me; While I was musing the fire burned: [Then] spake I with my tongue:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:4">39:4</a> Jehovah, make me to know mine end, And the measure of my days, what it is; Let me know how frail I am.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:5">39:5</a> Behold, thou hast made my days [as] handbreadths; And my life-time is as nothing before thee: Surely every man at his best estate is altogether vanity. Selah</p>

 <p><a name="an_40:1">40:1</a> For the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David. I waited patiently for Jehovah; And he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:2">40:2</a> He brought me up also out of a horrible pit, out of the miry clay; And he set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:3">40:3</a> And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God: Many shall see it, and fear, And shall trust in Jehovah.</p>

 <p><a name="an_40:5">40:5</a> Many, O Jehovah my God, are the wonderful works which thou hast done, And thy thoughts which are to us-ward; They cannot be set in order unto thee; If I would declare and speak of them, They are more than can be numbered.</p>

 <p><a name="an_55:8">55:8</a> I would haste me to a shelter From the stormy wind and tempest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:9">55:9</a> Destroy, O Lord, [and] divide their tongue; For I have seen violence and strife in the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:10">55:10</a> Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof: Iniquity also and mischief are in the midst of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:11">55:11</a> Wickedness is in the midst thereof: Oppression and guile depart not from its streets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:12">55:12</a> For it was not an enemy that reproached me; Then I could have borne it: Neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me; Then I would have hid myself from him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:13">55:13</a> But it was thou, a man mine equal, My companion, and my familiar friend.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:14">55:14</a> We took sweet counsel together; We walked in the house of God with the throng.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:15">55:15</a> Let death come suddenly upon them, Let them go down alive into Sheol; For wickedness is in their dwelling, in the midst of them.</p>

 <p><a name="an_55:17">55:17</a> Evening, and morning, and at noonday, will I complain, and moan; And he will hear my voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:18">55:18</a> He hath redeemed my soul in peace from the battle that was against me; For they were many [that strove] with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:19">55:19</a> God will hear, and answer them, Even he that abideth of old, Selah [The men] who have no changes, And who fear not God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:20">55:20</a> He hath put forth his hands against such as were at peace with him: He hath profaned his covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:21">55:21</a> His mouth was smooth as butter, But his heart was war: His words were softer than oil, Yet were they drawn swords.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:22">55:22</a> Cast thy burden upon Jehovah, and he will sustain thee: He will never suffer the righteous to be moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:23">55:23</a> But thou, O God, wilt bring them down into the pit of destruction: Bloodthirsty and deceitful men shall not live out half their days; But I will trust in thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:1">56:1</a> For the Chief Musician; set to Jonath elem rehokim. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam: when the Philistines took him in Gath. Be merciful unto me, O God; for man would swallow me up: All the day long he fighting oppresseth me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:2">56:2</a> Mine enemies would swallow me up all the day long; For they are many that fight proudly against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:3">56:3</a> What time I am afraid, I will put my trust in thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:4">56:4</a> In God (I will praise his word), In God have I put my trust, I will not be afraid; What can flesh do unto me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:5">56:5</a> All the day long they wrest my words: All their thoughts are against me for evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:6">56:6</a> They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, They mark my steps, Even as they have waited for my soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:7">56:7</a> Shall they escape by iniquity? In anger cast down the peoples, O God.</p>

 <p><a name="an_57:1">57:1</a> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam; when he fled from Saul, in the cave. Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me; For my soul taketh refuge in thee: Yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I take refuge, Until [these] calamities be overpast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:2">57:2</a> I will cry unto God Most High, Unto God that performeth [all things] for me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:3">57:3</a> He will send from heaven, and save me, [When] he that would swallow me up reproacheth; Selah God will send forth his lovingkindness and his truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:4">57:4</a> My soul is among lions; I lie among them that are set on fire, Even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And their tongue a sharp sword.</p>

 <p><a name="an_57:6">57:6</a> They have prepared a net for my steps; My soul is bowed down: They have digged a pit before me; They are fallen into the midst thereof themselves. Selah</p>

 <p><a name="an_58:1">58:1</a> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tashheth. [A Psalm] of David. Michtam. Do ye indeed in silence speak righteousness? Do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:2">58:2</a> Nay, in heart ye work wickedness; Ye weigh out the violence of your hands in the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:3">58:3</a> The wicked are estranged from the womb: They go astray as soon as they are born, speaking lies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:4">58:4</a> Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: [They are] like the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear,</p>

 <p><a name="an_59:5">59:5</a> Even thou, O Jehovah God of hosts, the God of Israel, Arise to visit all the nations: Be not merciful to any wicked transgressors. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:6">59:6</a> They return at evening, they howl like a dog, And go round about the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:7">59:7</a> Behold, they belch out with their mouth; Swords are in their lips: For who, [say they], doth hear?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:8">59:8</a> But thou, O Jehovah, wilt laugh at them; Thou wilt have all the nations in derision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:9">59:9</a> [Because of] his strength I will give heed unto thee; For God is my high tower.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:10">59:10</a> My God with his lovingkindness will meet me: God will let me see [my desire] upon mine enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:11">59:11</a> Slay them not, lest my people forget: Scatter them by thy power, and bring them down, O Lord our shield.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:12">59:12</a> [For] the sin of their mouth, [and] the words of their lips, Let them even be taken in their pride, And for cursing and lying which they speak.</p>

 <p><a name="an_59:15">59:15</a> They shall wander up and down for food, And tarry all night if they be not satisfied.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:16">59:16</a> But I will sing of thy strength; Yea, I will sing aloud of thy lovingkindness in the morning: For thou hast been my high tower, And a refuge in the day of my distress.</p>

Michtam of David, to teach; and when he strove with Aram-naharaim and with Aram-zobah, and Joab returned, and smote of Edom in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand.

 <p><a name="an_60:9">60:9</a> Who will bring me into the strong city? Who hath led me unto Edom?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:10">60:10</a> Hast not thou, O God, cast us off? And thou goest not forth, O God, with our hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:11">60:11</a> Give us help against the adversary; For vain is the help of man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:12">60:12</a> Through God we shall do valiantly; For he it is that will tread down our adversaries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:1">61:1</a> For the Chief Musician; on a stringed instrument. [A Psalm] of David. Hear my cry, O God; Attend unto my prayer.</p>

 <p><a name="an_61:4">61:4</a> I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever: I will take refuge in the covert of thy wings. Selah</p>

 <p><a name="an_62:3">62:3</a> How long will ye set upon a man, That ye may slay [him], all of you, Like a leaning wall, like a tottering fence?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:4">62:4</a> They only consult to thrust him down from his dignity; They delight in lies; They bless with their mouth, but they curse inwardly. Selah</p>

 <p><a name="an_62:8">62:8</a> Trust in him at all times, ye people; Pour out your heart before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:9">62:9</a> Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie: In the balances they will go up; They are together lighter than vanity.</p>

 <p><a name="an_63:9">63:9</a> But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, Shall go into the lower parts of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:10">63:10</a> They shall be given over to the power of the sword: They shall be a portion for foxes.</p>

 <p><a name="an_64:5">64:5</a> They encourage themselves in an evil purpose; They commune of laying snares privily; They say, Who will see them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:6">64:6</a> They search out iniquities; We have accomplished, [say they], a diligent search: And the inward thought and the heart of every one is deep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:7">64:7</a> But God will shoot at them; With an arrow suddenly shall they be wounded.</p>

 <p><a name="an_64:10">64:10</a> The righteous shall be glad in Jehovah, and shall take refuge in him; And all the upright in heart shall glory.</p>

 <p><a name="an_74:8">74:8</a> They said in their heart, Let us make havoc of them altogether: They have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:9">74:9</a> We see not our signs: There is no more any prophet; Neither is there among us any that knoweth how long.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:10">74:10</a> How long, O God, shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy blaspheme thy name for ever?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:11">74:11</a> Why drawest thou back thy hand, even thy right hand? [Pluck it] out of thy bosom [and] consume [them].</p>

 <p><a name="an_74:13">74:13</a> Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: Thou brakest the heads of the sea-monsters in the waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:14">74:14</a> Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces; Thou gavest him to be food to the people inhabiting the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:15">74:15</a> Thou didst cleave fountain and flood: Thou driedst up mighty rivers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_74:16">74:16</a> The day is thine, the night also is thine: Thou hast prepared the light and the sun.</p>

 <p><a name="an_74:18">74:18</a> Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O Jehovah, And that a foolish people hath blasphemed thy name.</p>

 <p><a name="an_75:1">75:1</a> For the Chief Musician; [set to] Al-tash-heth. A Psalm of Asaph; a song. We give thanks unto thee, O God; We give thanks, for thy name is near: Men tell of thy wondrous works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:2">75:2</a> When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:3">75:3</a> The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I have set up the pillars of it. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:4">75:4</a> I said unto the arrogant, Deal not arrogantly; And to the wicked, Lift not up the horn:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:5">75:5</a> Lift not up your horn on high; Speak not with a stiff neck.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:6">75:6</a> For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor yet from the south, [cometh] lifting up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:7">75:7</a> But God is the judge: He putteth down one, and lifteth up another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:8">75:8</a> For in the hand of Jehovah there is a cup, and the wine foameth; It is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the same: Surely the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall drain them, and drink them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:9">75:9</a> But I will declare for ever, I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_75:10">75:10</a> All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; But the horns of the righteous shall be lifted up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:1">76:1</a> For the Chief Musician; on stringed instruments. A Psalm of Asaph, a song. In Judah is God known: His name is great in Israel.</p>

 <p><a name="an_76:8">76:8</a> Thou didst cause sentence to be heard from heaven; The earth feared, and was still,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:9">76:9</a> When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_76:10">76:10</a> Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: The residue of wrath shalt thou gird upon thee.</p>

 <p><a name="an_77:1">77:1</a> For the Chief Musician; after the manner of Jeduthan. A Psalm of Asaph. I will cry unto God with my voice, Even unto God with my voice; and he will give ear unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:2">77:2</a> In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: My hand was stretched out in the night, and slacked not; My soul refused to be comforted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:3">77:3</a> I remember God, and am disquieted: I complain, and my spirit is overwhelmed. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:4">77:4</a> Thou holdest mine eyes watching: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:5">77:5</a> I have considered the days of old, The years of ancient times.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:6">77:6</a> I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart; And my spirit maketh diligent search.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:7">77:7</a> Will the Lord cast off for ever? And will he be favorable no more?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:8">77:8</a> Is his lovingkindness clean gone for ever? Doth his promise fail for evermore?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:9">77:9</a> Hath God forgotten to be gracious? Hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:10">77:10</a> And I said, This is my infirmity; [But I will remember] the years of the right hand of the Most High.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:11">77:11</a> I will make mention of the deeds of Jehovah; For I will remember thy wonders of old.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:12">77:12</a> I will meditate also upon all thy work, And muse on thy doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:13">77:13</a> Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: Who is a great god like unto God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:14">77:14</a> Thou art the God that doest wonders: Thou hast made known thy strength among the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:15">77:15</a> Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, The sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:16">77:16</a> The waters saw thee, O God; The waters saw thee, they were afraid: The depths also trembled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:17">77:17</a> The clouds poured out water; The skies sent out a sound: Thine arrows also went abroad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:18">77:18</a> The voice of thy thunder was in the whirlwind; The lightnings lightened the world: The earth trembled and shook.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:19">77:19</a> Thy way was in the sea, And thy paths in the great waters, And thy footsteps were not known.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_77:20">77:20</a> Thou leddest thy people like a flock, By the hand of Moses and Aaron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:1">78:1</a> Maschil of Asaph. Give ear, O my people, to my law: Incline your ears to the words of my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:2">78:2</a> I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings of old,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:3">78:3</a> Which we have heard and known, And our fathers have told us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:4">78:4</a> We will not hide them from their children, Telling to the generation to come the praises of Jehovah, And his strength, and his wondrous works that he hath done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:5">78:5</a> For he established a testimony in Jacob, And appointed a law in Israel, Which he commanded our fathers, That they should make them known to their children;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:6">78:6</a> That the generation to come might know [them], even the children that should be born; Who should arise and tell [them] to their children,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:7">78:7</a> That they might set their hope in God, And not forget the works of God, But keep his commandments,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:8">78:8</a> And might not be as their fathers, A stubborn and rebellious generation, A generation that set not their heart aright, And whose spirit was not stedfast with God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:9">78:9</a> The children of Ephraim, being armed and carrying bows, Turned back in the day of battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:10">78:10</a> They kept not the covenant of God, And refused to walk in his law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:11">78:11</a> And they forgat his doings, And his wondrous works that he had showed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:12">78:12</a> Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, In the land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:13">78:13</a> He clave the sea, and caused them to pass through; And he made the waters to stand as a heap.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:14">78:14</a> In the day-time also he led them with a cloud, And all the night with a light of fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:15">78:15</a> He clave rocks in the wilderness, And gave them drink abundantly as out of the depths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:16">78:16</a> He brought streams also out of the rock, And caused waters to run down like rivers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:17">78:17</a> Yet went they on still to sin against him, To rebel against the Most High in the desert.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:18">78:18</a> And they tempted God in their heart By asking food according to their desire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:19">78:19</a> Yea, they spake against God; They said, Can God prepare a table in the wilderness?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:20">78:20</a> Behold, he smote the rock, so that waters gushed out, And streams overflowed; Can he give bread also? Will he provide flesh for his people?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:21">78:21</a> Therefore Jehovah heard, and was wroth; And a fire was kindled against Jacob, And anger also went up against Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:22">78:22</a> Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:23">78:23</a> Yet he commanded the skies above, And opened the doors of heaven;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:24">78:24</a> And he rained down manna upon them to eat, And gave them food from heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:25">78:25</a> Man did eat the bread of the mighty: He sent them food to the full.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:26">78:26</a> He caused the east wind to blow in the heavens; And by his power he guided the south wind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:27">78:27</a> He rained flesh also upon them as the dust, And winged birds as the sand of the seas:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:28">78:28</a> And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, Round about their habitations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:29">78:29</a> So they did eat, and were well filled; And he gave them their own desire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:30">78:30</a> They were not estranged from that which they desired, Their food was yet in their mouths,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:31">78:31</a> When the anger of God went up against them, And slew of the fattest of them, And smote down the young men of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:32">78:32</a> For all this they sinned still, And believed not in his wondrous works.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:33">78:33</a> Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, And their years in terror.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:34">78:34</a> When he slew them, then they inquired after him; And they returned and sought God earnestly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:35">78:35</a> And they remembered that God was their rock, And the Most High God their redeemer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:36">78:36</a> But they flattered him with their mouth, And lied unto him with their tongue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:37">78:37</a> For their heart was not right with him, Neither were they faithful in his covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:38">78:38</a> But he, being merciful, forgave [their] iniquity, and destroyed [them] not: Yea, many a time turned he his anger away, And did not stir up all his wrath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:39">78:39</a> And he remembered that they were but flesh, A wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:40">78:40</a> How oft did they rebel against him in the wilderness, And grieve him in the desert!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:41">78:41</a> And they turned again and tempted God, And provoked the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:42">78:42</a> They remember not his hand, Nor the day when he redeemed them from the adversary;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:43">78:43</a> How he set his signs in Egypt, And his wonders in the field of Zoan,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:44">78:44</a> And turned their rivers into blood, And their streams, so that they could not drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:45">78:45</a> He sent among them swarms of flies, which devoured them; And frogs, which destroyed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:46">78:46</a> He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, And their labor unto the locust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:47">78:47</a> He destroyed their vines with hail, And their sycomore-trees with frost.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:48">78:48</a> He gave over their cattle also to the hail, And their flocks to hot thunderbolts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:49">78:49</a> He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, Wrath, and indignation, and trouble, A band of angels of evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:50">78:50</a> He made a path for his anger; He spared not their soul from death, But gave their life over to the pestilence,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:51">78:51</a> And smote all the first-born in Egypt, The chief of their strength in the tents of Ham.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:52">78:52</a> But he led forth his own people like sheep, And guided them in the wilderness like a flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:53">78:53</a> And he led them safely, so that they feared not; But the sea overwhelmed their enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:54">78:54</a> And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, To this mountain, which his right hand had gotten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:55">78:55</a> He drove out the nations also before them, And allotted them for an inheritance by line, And made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:56">78:56</a> Yet they tempted and rebelled against the Most High God, And kept not his testimonies;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:57">78:57</a> But turned back, and dealt treacherously like their fathers: They were turned aside like a deceitful bow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:58">78:58</a> For they provoked him to anger with their high places, And moved him to jealousy with their graven images.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:59">78:59</a> When God heard [this], he was wroth, And greatly abhorred Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:60">78:60</a> So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, The tent which he placed among men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:61">78:61</a> And delivered his strength into captivity, And his glory into the adversary's hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:62">78:62</a> He gave his people over also unto the sword, And was wroth with his inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:63">78:63</a> Fire devoured their young men; And their virgins had no marriage-song.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:64">78:64</a> Their priests fell by the sword; And their widows made no lamentation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:65">78:65</a> Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, Like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:66">78:66</a> And he smote his adversaries backward: He put them to a perpetual reproach.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:67">78:67</a> Moreover he refused the tent of Joseph, And chose not the tribe of Ephraim,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:68">78:68</a> But chose the tribe of Judah, The mount Zion which he loved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:69">78:69</a> And he built his sanctuary like the heights, Like the earth which he hath established for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:70">78:70</a> He chose David also his servant, And took him from the sheepfolds:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:71">78:71</a> From following the ewes that have their young he brought him, To be the shepherd of Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_78:72">78:72</a> So he was their shepherd according to the integrity of his heart, And guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:1">79:1</a> A Psalm of Asaph. O God, the nations are come into thine inheritance; Thy holy temple have they defiled; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:2">79:2</a> The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be food unto the birds of the heavens, The flesh of thy saints unto the beasts of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:3">79:3</a> Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem; And there was none to bury them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:4">79:4</a> We are become a reproach to our neighbors, A scoffing and derision to them that are round about us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:5">79:5</a> How long, O Jehovah? wilt thou be angry for ever? Shall thy jealousy burn like fire?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:6">79:6</a> Pour out thy wrath upon the nations that know thee not, And upon the kingdoms that call not upon thy name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:7">79:7</a> For they have devoured Jacob, And laid waste his habitation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:8">79:8</a> Remember not against us the iniquities of our forefathers: Let thy tender mercies speedily meet us; For we are brought very low.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:9">79:9</a> Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name; And deliver us, and forgive our sins, for thy name's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:10">79:10</a> Wherefore should the nations say, Where is their God? Let the avenging of the blood of thy servants which is shed Be known among the nations in our sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:11">79:11</a> Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee: According to the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are appointed to death;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:12">79:12</a> And render unto our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom Their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_79:13">79:13</a> So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture Will give thee thanks for ever: We will show forth thy praise to all generations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_80:1">80:1</a> For the Chief Musician, set to Shoshanim Eduth.. A Psalm of Asaph. Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, Thou that leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou that sittest [above] the cherubim, shine forth.</p>

 <p><a name="an_80:5">80:5</a> Thou hast fed them with the bread of tears, And given them tears to drink in large measure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_80:6">80:6</a> Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbors; And our enemies laugh among themselves.</p>

 <p><a name="an_80:8">80:8</a> Thou broughtest a vine out of Egypt: Thou didst drive out the nations, and plantedst it.</p>

 <p><a name="an_80:10">80:10</a> The mountains were covered with the shadow of it, And the boughs thereof were [like] cedars of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_80:11">80:11</a> It sent out its branches unto the sea, And its shoots unto the River.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_80:12">80:12</a> Why hast thou broken down its walls, So that all they that pass by the way do pluck it?</p>

 <p><a name="an_103:4">103:4</a> Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; Who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:5">103:5</a> Who satisfieth thy desire with good things, [So that] thy youth is renewed like the eagle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:6">103:6</a> Jehovah executeth righteous acts, And judgments for all that are oppressed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:7">103:7</a> He made known his ways unto Moses, His doings unto the children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:8">103:8</a> Jehovah is merciful and gracious, Slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:9">103:9</a> He will not always chide; Neither will he keep [his anger] for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:10">103:10</a> He hath not dealt with us after our sins, Nor rewarded us after our iniquities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:11">103:11</a> For as the heavens are high above the earth, So great is his lovingkindness toward them that fear him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:12">103:12</a> As far as the east is from the west, So far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:13">103:13</a> Like as a father pitieth his children, So Jehovah pitieth them that fear him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:14">103:14</a> For he knoweth our frame; He remembereth that we are dust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_103:15">103:15</a> As for man, his days are as grass; As a flower of the field, so he flourisheth.</p>

 <p><a name="an_104:1">104:1</a> Bless Jehovah, O my soul. O Jehovah my God, thou art very great; Thou art clothed with honor and majesty:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:2">104:2</a> Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment; Who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:3">104:3</a> Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters; Who maketh the clouds his chariot; Who walketh upon the wings of the wind;</p>

 <p><a name="an_104:5">104:5</a> Who laid the foundations of the earth, That it should not be moved for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:6">104:6</a> Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a vesture; The waters stood above the mountains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:7">104:7</a> At thy rebuke they fled; At the voice of thy thunder they hasted away</p>

 <p><a name="an_104:9">104:9</a> Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; That they turn not again to cover the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:10">104:10</a> He sendeth forth springs into the valleys; They run among the mountains;</p>

 <p><a name="an_104:14">104:14</a> He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, And herb for the service of man; That he may bring forth food out of the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:15">104:15</a> And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, [And] oil to make his face to shine, And bread that strengtheneth man's heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:16">104:16</a> The trees of Jehovah are filled [with moisture], The cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;</p>

 <p><a name="an_104:19">104:19</a> He appointed the moon for seasons: The sun knoweth his going down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:20">104:20</a> Thou makest darkness, and it is night, Wherein all the beasts of the forest creep forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:21">104:21</a> The young lions roar after their prey, And seek their food from God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_104:22">104:22</a> The sun ariseth, they get them away, And lay them down in their dens.</p>

 <p><a name="an_105:8">105:8</a> He hath remembered his covenant for ever, The word which he commanded to a thousand generations,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:9">105:9</a> [The covenant] which he made with Abraham, And his oath unto Isaac,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:10">105:10</a> And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a statute, To Israel for an everlasting covenant,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:11">105:11</a> Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, The lot of your inheritance;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:12">105:12</a> When they were but a few men in number, Yea, very few, and sojourners in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:13">105:13</a> And they went about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:14">105:14</a> He suffered no man to do them wrong; Yea, he reproved kings for their sakes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:15">105:15</a> [Saying], Touch not mine anointed ones, And do my prophets no harm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:16">105:16</a> And he called for a famine upon the land; He brake the whole staff of bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:17">105:17</a> He sent a man before them; Joseph was sold for a servant:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:18">105:18</a> His feet they hurt with fetters: He was laid in [chains of] iron,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:19">105:19</a> Until the time that his word came to pass, The word of Jehovah tried him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:20">105:20</a> The king sent and loosed him; Even the ruler of peoples, and let him go free.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:21">105:21</a> He made him lord of his house, And ruler of all his substance;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:22">105:22</a> To bind his princes at his pleasure, And teach his elders wisdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:23">105:23</a> Israel also came into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of Ham.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:24">105:24</a> And he increased his people greatly, And made them stronger than their adversaries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:25">105:25</a> He turned their heart to hate his people, To deal subtly with his servants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:26">105:26</a> He sent Moses his servant, [And] Aaron whom he had chosen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:27">105:27</a> They set among them his signs, And wonders in the land of Ham.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:28">105:28</a> He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they rebelled not against his words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:29">105:29</a> He turned their waters into blood, And slew their fish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:30">105:30</a> Their land swarmed with frogs In the chambers of their kings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:31">105:31</a> He spake, and there came swarms of flies, And lice in all their borders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:32">105:32</a> He gave them hail for rain, [And] flaming fire in their land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:33">105:33</a> He smote their vines also and their fig-trees, And brake the trees of their borders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:34">105:34</a> He spake, and the locust came, And the grasshopper, and that without number,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:35">105:35</a> And did eat up every herb in their land, And did eat up the fruit of their ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:36">105:36</a> He smote also all the first-born in their land, The chief of all their strength.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:37">105:37</a> And he brought them forth with silver and gold; And there was not one feeble person among his tribes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:38">105:38</a> Egypt was glad when they departed; For the fear of them had fallen upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:39">105:39</a> He spread a cloud for a covering, And fire to give light in the night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:40">105:40</a> They asked, and he brought quails, And satisfied them with the bread of heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:41">105:41</a> He opened the rock, and waters gushed out; They ran in the dry places [like] a river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:42">105:42</a> For he remembered his holy word, [And] Abraham his servant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:43">105:43</a> And he brought forth his people with joy, [And] his chosen with singing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:44">105:44</a> And he gave them the lands of the nations; And they took the labor of the peoples in possession:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_105:45">105:45</a> That they might keep his statutes, And observe his laws. Praise ye Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:1">106:1</a> Praise ye Jehovah. Oh give thanks unto Jehovah; for he is good; For his lovingkindness [endureth] forever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:2">106:2</a> Who can utter the mighty acts of Jehovah, Or show forth all his praise?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:3">106:3</a> Blessed are they that keep justice, And he that doeth righteousness at all times.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:4">106:4</a> Remember me, O Jehovah, with the favor that thou bearest unto thy people; Oh visit me with thy salvation,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:5">106:5</a> That I may see the prosperity of thy chosen, That I may rejoice in the gladness of thy nation, That I may glory with thine inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:6">106:6</a> We have sinned with our fathers, We have committed iniquity, we have done wickedly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:7">106:7</a> Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; They remembered not the multitude of thy lovingkindnesses, But were rebellious at the sea, even at the Red Sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:8">106:8</a> Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, That he might make his mighty power to be known.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:9">106:9</a> He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: So he led them through the depths, as through a wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:10">106:10</a> And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, And redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:11">106:11</a> And the waters covered their adversaries; There was not one of them left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:12">106:12</a> Then believed they his words; They sang his praise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:13">106:13</a> They soon forgat his works; They waited not for his counsel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:14">106:14</a> But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, And tempted God in the desert.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:15">106:15</a> And he gave them their request, But sent leanness into their soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:16">106:16</a> They envied Moses also in the camp, [And] Aaron the saint of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:17">106:17</a> The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, And covered the company of Abiram.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:18">106:18</a> And a fire was kindled in their company; The flame burned up the wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:19">106:19</a> They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped a molten image.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:20">106:20</a> Thus they changed their glory For the likeness of an ox that eateth grass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:21">106:21</a> They forgat God their Saviour, Who had done great things in Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:22">106:22</a> Wondrous works in the land of Ham, [And] terrible things by the Red Sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:23">106:23</a> Therefore he said that he would destroy them, Had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, To turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:24">106:24</a> Yea, they despised the pleasant land, They believed not his word,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:25">106:25</a> But murmured in their tents, And hearkened not unto the voice of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:26">106:26</a> Therefore he sware unto them, That he would overthrow them in the wilderness,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:27">106:27</a> And that he would overthrow their seed among the nations, And scatter them in the lands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:28">106:28</a> They joined themselves also unto Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of the dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:29">106:29</a> Thus they provoked him to anger with their doings; And the plague brake in upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:30">106:30</a> Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment; And so the plague was stayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:31">106:31</a> And that was reckoned unto him for righteousness, Unto all generations for evermore.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:32">106:32</a> They angered him also at the waters of Meribah, So that it went ill with Moses for their sakes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:33">106:33</a> Because they were rebellious against his spirit, And he spake unadvisedly with his lips.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:34">106:34</a> They did not destroy the peoples, As Jehovah commanded them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:35">106:35</a> But mingled themselves with the nations, And learned their works,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:36">106:36</a> And served their idols, Which became a snare unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:37">106:37</a> Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:38">106:38</a> And shed innocent blood, Even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, Whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan; And the land was polluted with blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:39">106:39</a> Thus were they defiled with their works, And played the harlot in their doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:40">106:40</a> Therefore was the wrath of Jehovah kindled against his people, And he abhorred his inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:41">106:41</a> And he gave them into the hand of the nations; And they that hated them ruled over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:42">106:42</a> Their enemies also oppressed them, And they were brought into subjection under their hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:43">106:43</a> Many times did he deliver them; But they were rebellious in their counsel, And were brought low in their iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:44">106:44</a> Nevertheless he regarded their distress, When he heard their cry:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:45">106:45</a> And he remembered for them his covenant, And repented according to the multitude of his lovingkindnesses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:46">106:46</a> He made them also to be pitied Of all those that carried them captive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_106:47">106:47</a> Save us, O Jehovah our God, And gather us from among the nations, To give thanks unto thy holy name, And to triumph in thy praise.</p>

 <p><a name="an_107:4">107:4</a> They wandered in the wilderness in a desert way; They found no city of habitation.</p>
