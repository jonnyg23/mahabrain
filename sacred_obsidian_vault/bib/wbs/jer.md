  <h3 align="center">Webster's Bible: Jeremiah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah king of Judah, to the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth month. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Before I formed thee in embryo I knew thee; and before thou wast born I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a prophet to the nations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> But the LORD said to me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go to all that I shall send thee, and whatever I command thee thou shalt speak. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD said to me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw down, to build, and to plant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Jeremiah, What seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Then said the LORD to me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and its face is towards the north. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Then the LORD said to me, Out of the north an evil shall break forth upon all the inhabitants of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> For lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north, saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his throne at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all its walls around, and against all the cities of Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burned incense to other gods, and worshiped the works of their own hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak to them all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I confound thee before them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> For behold, I have made thee this day a fortified city, and an iron pillar, and brazen walls against the whole land, against the kings of Judah, against her princes, against her priests, and against the people of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> Go, and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thy espousals, when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not sown. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Israel was holiness to the LORD, and the first-fruits of his increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families of the house of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me, that they have gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and have become vain? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us out of the land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of deserts and of pits, through a land of drouth, and of the shades of death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man dwelt? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit of it, and the goodness of it; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and made my heritage an abomination. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not profit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your children's children will I plead. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send to Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there is such a thing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye very desolate, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the fountain of living waters, and hewed out for themselves cisterns, broken cisterns, that can hold no water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Is Israel a servant? is he a home-born slave? why is he laid waste? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of thy head. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Hast thou not procured this to thyself in that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the river? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> Thy own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine to me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> For though thou shalt wash thee with niter, and take thee much soap, yet thy iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a swift dromedary traversing her ways; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst: but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and after them will I go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel ashamed: they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their prophets, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast brought me forth: for they have turned their back to me, and not their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and save us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> But where are thy gods that thou hast made for thyself? let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> Why will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against me, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> In vain have I smitten your children; they have received no correction: your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness to Israel? a land of darkness? why say my people, We are lords; we will come no more to thee? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my people have forgotten me days without number. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also taught the wicked ones thy ways. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger will turn from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have not sinned. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> Why dost thou go about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> Yes, thou shalt go forth from him, and thy hands upon thy head: for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> They say, If a man shall put away his wife, and she shall go from him, and become another man's, shall he return to her again? shall not that land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Lift up thy eyes to the high places, and see where thou hast not been lain with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy acts of lewdness, and with thy wickedness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> Therefore the showers have been withheld, and there hath been no latter rain? and thou hadst a harlot's forehead, thou refusedst to be ashamed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Wilt thou not from this time cry to me, My father, thou art the guide of my youth? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Will he retain his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end? Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldst. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> The LORD said also to me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she hath gone up upon every high mountain, and under every green tree, and there hath played the harlot. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou to me. But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And I saw, when for all the causes by which backsliding Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce; yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the harlot also. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And it came to pass through the lightness of her lewdness, that she defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned to me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And the LORD said to me, The backsliding Israel hath justified herself more than treacherous Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Go and proclaim these words towards the north, and say, Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause my anger to fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep anger for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Only acknowledge thy iniquity, that thou hast transgressed against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married to you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will bring you to Zion: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And I will give you pastors according to my heart, who shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And it shall come to pass, when ye shall be multiplied and increased in the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and all the nations shall be gathered to it, to the name of the LORD, to Jerusalem; neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of their evil heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of Israel, and they shall come together from the land of the north to the land that I have given for an inheritance to your fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said, Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they have forgotten the LORD their God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings. Behold, we come to thee; for thou art the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> For shame hath devoured the labor of our fathers from our youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our youth even to this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the LORD, return to me: and if thou wilt put away thy abominations out of my sight, then shalt thou not remove. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And thou shalt swear, The LORD liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in him shall they glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Circumcise yourselves to the LORD, and take away the foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the trumpet in the land: cry, Gather together, and say, Assemble yourselves, and let us go into the fortified cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Set up the standard towards Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring evil from the north, and a great destruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy land desolate; thy cities shall be laid waste, without an inhabitant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl for the fierce anger of the LORD is not turned back from us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! surely thou hast greatly deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword reacheth to the soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A dry wind of the high places in the wilderness towards the daughter of my people, not to fan, nor to cleanse, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Even a full wind from those places shall come to me: now also will I give sentence against them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe to us! for we are laid waste. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> O Jerusalem, wash thy heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from mount Ephraim. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem, that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against the cities of Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> As keepers of a field they are against her on all sides; because she hath been rebellious against me, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> Thy way and thy doings have procured these things to thee; this is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth to thy heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is laid waste; suddenly are my tents ruined, and my curtains in a moment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the trumpet? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> For my people are foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish children, and they have no understanding: they are wise to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> I beheld the earth, and lo, it was without form, and void; and the heavens, and they had no light. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled, and all the hills moved lightly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> I beheld, and lo, there was no man, and all the fowls of the heavens had fled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> I beheld, and lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all its cities were broken down at the presence of the LORD, and by his fierce anger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> For thus hath the LORD said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet will I not make a full end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black: because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent, neither will I turn back from it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen; they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> And when thou art laid waste, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold, though thou rendest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make thyself fair: thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands, saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and know, and seek in its broad places, if ye can find a man, if there is any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I will pardon it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And though they say, The LORD liveth; surely they swear falsely. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> O LORD, are not thy eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them, but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a rock; they have refused to return. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they know not the way of the LORD, nor the judgment of their God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> I will go to the great men, and will speak to them; for they have known the way of the LORD, and the judgment of their God: but these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Wherefore a lion from the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities: every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, then they committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the harlots' houses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his neighbor's wife. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take away her battlements; for they are not the LORD'S. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very treacherously against me, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> They have belied the LORD, and said, It is not he; neither shall evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them: thus shall it be done to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Wherefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, Because ye speak this word, Behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel, saith the LORD: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they say. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Their quiver is as an open sepulcher, they are all mighty men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And they shall eat up thy harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thy herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees: they shall impoverish with the sword thy fortified cities, in which thou hast trusted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Nevertheless in those days, saith the LORD, I will not make a full end with you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Why doeth the LORD our God all these things to us? then shalt thou answer them, As ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; who have eyes, and see not; who have ears, and hear not: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> Fear ye not me? saith the LORD: will ye not tremble at my presence, who have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual decree, that it cannot pass it: and though its waves toss themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they not pass over it? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> But this people have a revolting and a rebellious heart; they have revolted and gone. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God, that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in its season: he reserveth to us the appointed weeks of harvest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have withheld good things from you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit: therefore they have become great, and have grown rich. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> They have become fat, they shine: yes, they surpass the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> Shall I not visit for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end thereof? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of fire in Beth-haccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great destruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> The shepherds with their flocks shall come to her; they shall pitch their tents against her on every side; they shall feed every one in his place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe to us! for the day departeth, for the shadows of the evening are lengthened. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> For thus hath the LORD of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly oppression in the midst of her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her wickedness: violence and devastation is heard in her; before me continually are grief and wounds. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall thoroughly glean the remnant of Israel as a vine: turn back thy hand as a grape-gatherer into the baskets. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear? Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold, the word of the LORD is to them a reproach; they have no delight in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> Therefore I am full of the fury of the LORD; I am weary with holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And their houses shall be turned to others, with their fields and wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of the land, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> For from the least of them even to the greatest of them every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even to the priest every one dealeth falsely. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the old paths, where is the good way, and walk in it, and ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened to my words, nor to my law, but have rejected it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the sweet cane from a distant country? your burnt-offerings are not acceptable, nor your sacrifices sweet to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will lay stumbling-blocks before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall upon them; the neighbor and his friend shall perish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> Thus saith the LORD, Behold, a people cometh from the north country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> We have heard the fame of it: our hands become feeble: anguish hath taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of the enemy and fear is on every side. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that thou mayest know and try their way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are brass and iron; they are all corrupters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> The bellows is burned, the lead is consumed by the fire; the founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath rejected them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> Stand in the gate of the LORD'S house, and proclaim there this word, and say, Hear the word of the LORD, all ye of Judah, that enter in at these gates to worship the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, The temple of the LORD, are these. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> For if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye thoroughly execute judgment between a man and his neighbor; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to your hurt: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I gave to your fathers, for ever and ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> Will ye steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely, and burn incense to Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye know not; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> But go ye now to my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my people Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and I spoke to you, rising early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I called you, but ye answered not; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Therefore will I do to this house, which is called by my name, in which ye trust, and to the place which I gave to you and to your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to other gods, that they may provoke me to anger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke themselves to the confusion of their own faces? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, my anger and my fury shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat flesh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> For I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt-offerings or sacrifices: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> But this thing I commanded them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways that I have commanded you, that it may be well to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward, and not forward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> Since the day that your fathers came forth from the land of Egypt to this day I have even sent to you all my servants the prophets, daily rising early and sending them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> Yet they hearkened not to me, nor inclined their ear, but hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> Therefore thou shalt speak all these words to them; but they will not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call to them; but they will not answer thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:28">7:28</a> But thou shalt say to them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth hath perished, and is cut off from their mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:29">7:29</a> Cut off thy hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the generation of his wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:30">7:30</a> For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the LORD: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by my name, to pollute it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:31">7:31</a> And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:32">7:32</a> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there shall be no place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:33">7:33</a> And the carcasses of this people shall be food for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall frighten them away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:34">7:34</a> Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land shall be desolate. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> At that time, saith the LORD, they shall bring the bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they have worshiped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung upon the face of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of them that remain of this evil family, who remain in all the places whither I have driven them, saith the LORD of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> Moreover, thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> Why then hath this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> I hearkened and heard, but they spoke not aright: no man repented of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to his course, as the horse rusheth to the battle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> Yes, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the LORD is with us? Lo, certainly in vain he hath made it; the pen of the scribes is in vain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have rejected the word of the LORD; and what wisdom is in them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> Therefore will I give their wives to others, and their fields to them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even to the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even to the priest every one dealeth falsely. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? no, they were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall be cast down, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> I will surely consume them, saith the LORD: there shall be no grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree, and the leaf shall fade; and the things that I have given to them shall pass away from them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fortified cities, and let us be silent there: for the LORD our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have sinned against the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, and behold, trouble! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they have come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and those that dwell therein. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> For behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of them that dwell in a distant country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven images, and with strange vanities? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black; astonishment hath taken hold on me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> Is there no balm in Gilead: is there no physician there? why then is not the health of the daughter of my people recovered. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Oh that my head were waters, and my eyes a fountain of tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging-place of way-faring men; that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies: but they are not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Take ye heed every one of his neighbor, and trust ye not in any brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbor will walk with slanders. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And they will deceive every one his neighbor, and will not speak the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary themselves to commit iniquity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they refuse to know me, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them, and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit: one speaketh peaceably to his neighbor with his mouth, but in heart he layeth his wait. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast have fled; they are gone. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> Who is the wise man that may understand this? and who is he to whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none passeth through? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after Baalim, which their fathers taught them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water of gall to drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor their fathers have known: and I will send a sword after them, till I have consumed them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the mourning women, that they may come; and send for skillful women, that they may come: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we laid waste! we are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our dwellings have cast us out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one her neighbor lamentation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> For death hath come up into our windows, and hath entered into our palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from the streets. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcasses of men shall fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvest-man, and none shall gather them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> But let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he understandeth and knoweth me, that I am the LORD who exercise loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them who are circumcised with the uncircumcised; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab, and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness: for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in the heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Hear ye the word which the LORD speaketh to you, O house of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> Thus saith the LORD, Learn not the way of the heathen, and be not dismayed at the signs of heaven; for the heathen are dismayed at them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> For the customs of the people are vain: for one cutteth a tree out of the forest, the work of the hands of the workman, with the ax. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> They deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with nails and with hammers, that it may not move. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> They are upright as the palm tree, but speak not: they must needs be borne, because they cannot go. Be not afraid of them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> Forasmuch as there is none like to thee, O LORD; thou art great, and thy name is great in might. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? for to thee doth it appertain: forasmuch as among all the wise men of the nations, and in all their kingdoms, there is none like to thee. </p>

 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Hear ye the words of this covenant, and speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And say thou to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this covenant, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> Which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace, saying, Obey my voice, and do them, according to all which I command you: so shall ye be my people, and I will be your God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> That I may perform the oath which I have sworn to your fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it is this day. Then answered I, and said, So be it, O LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> Then the LORD said to me, Proclaim all these words in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying, Hear ye the words of this covenant, and do them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> For I earnestly protested to your fathers in the day that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, even to this day, rising early and protesting, saying, Obey my voice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> Yet they obeyed not, nor inclined their ear, but walked every one in the imagination of their evil heart: therefore I will bring upon them all the words of this covenant, which I commanded them to do; but they did them not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And the LORD said to me, A conspiracy is found among the men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> They have turned back to the iniquities of their forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they went after other gods to serve them: the house of Israel and the house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon them which they shall not be able to escape; and though they shall cry to me, I will not hearken to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem go, and cry to the gods to which they offer incense: but they shall not save them at all in the time of their trouble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> For according to the number of thy cities were thy gods, O Judah; and according to the number of the streets of Jerusalem have ye set up altars to that shameful thing, even altars to burn incense to Baal. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up a cry or prayer for them: for I will not hear them in the time when they cry to me for their trouble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing she hath wrought lewdness with many; and the holy flesh is passed from thee? when thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> The LORD called thy name, A green olive tree, fair, and of goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled fire upon it, and the branches of it are broken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> For the LORD of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of the house of Judah, which they have done against themselves to provoke me to anger in offering incense to Baal. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And the LORD hath given me knowledge of it, and I know it: then thou showedst me their doings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> But I was like a lamb or an ox that is brought to the slaughter; and I knew not that they had devised devices against me, saying, Let us destroy the tree with its fruit, and let us cut him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no more remembered. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> But, O LORD of hosts, that judgest righteously, that triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for to thee have I revealed my cause. </p>

 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will punish them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> And there shall be no remnant of them: for I will bring evil upon the men of Anathoth, even the year of their visitation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> Righteous art thou, O LORD, when I plead with thee: yet let me speak with thee of thy judgments: Why doth the way of the wicked prosper? why are they all happy that deal very treacherously? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> Thou hast planted them, yes, they have taken root: they grow, yes, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> But thou, O LORD, knowest me: thou hast seen me, and tried my heart towards thee: pull them out like sheep for the slaughter, and prepare them for the day of slaughter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of every field wither, for the wickedness of them that dwell therein? the beasts are consumed, and the birds; because they said, He will not see our last end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> If thou hast run with the footmen, and they have wearied thee, then how canst thou contend with horses? and if in the land of peace, in which thou hast trusted, they wearied thee, then how wilt thou do in the swelling of Jordan? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even they have dealt treacherously with thee; yes, they have called a multitude after thee: believe them not, though they speak fair words to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> I have forsaken my house, I have left my heritage; I have given the dearly beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> My heritage is to me as a lion in the forest; it crieth out against me: therefore have I hated it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> My heritage is to me as a speckled bird, the birds around are against her; come ye, assemble all the beasts of the field, come to devour. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> Many pastors have destroyed my vineyard, they have trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant portion a desolate wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> They have made it desolate, and being desolate it mourneth to me; the whole land is made desolate, because no man layeth it to heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> The spoilers have come upon all high places through the wilderness: for the sword of the LORD shall devour from the one end of the land even to the other end of the land: no flesh shall have peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> They have sown wheat, but shall reap thorns: they have put themselves to pain, but shall not profit; and they shall be ashamed of your revenues because of the fierce anger of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> Thus saith the LORD against all my evil neighbors, that touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to inherit; Behold, I will pluck them out of their land, and pluck out the house of Judah from among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them out I will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them again, every man to his heritage, and every man to his land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn the ways of my people, to swear by my name, The LORD liveth; as they taught my people to swear by Baal; then shall they be built in the midst of my people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> But if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and destroy that nation, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> Thus saith the LORD to me, Go and get for thee a linen girdle, and put it upon thy loins, and put it not in water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> So I procured a girdle according to the word of the LORD, and put it on my loins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And the word of the LORD came to me the second time, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Take the girdle that thou hast procured, which is upon thy loins, and arise, go to Euphrates, and hide it there in a hole of the rock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> So I went, and hid it by Euphrates, as the LORD commanded me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And it came to pass after many days, that the LORD said to me, Arise, go to Euphrates, and take the girdle from thence, which I commanded thee to hide there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Then I went to Euphrates, and digged, and took the girdle from the place where I had hid it: and behold, the girdle was marred, it was profitable for nothing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> Thus saith the LORD, After this manner will I mar the pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in the imagination of their heart, and walk after other gods, to serve them, and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle, which is good for nothing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> For as the girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I caused to cleave to me the whole house of Israel and the whole house of Judah, saith the LORD; that they might be to me for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a glory: but they would not hear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> Therefore thou shalt speak to them this word; Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Every bottle shall be filled with wine: and they shall say to thee, Do we not certainly know that every bottle shall be filled with wine? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> Then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, even the kings that sit upon David's throne, and the priests, and the prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with drunkenness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> And I will dash them one against another, even the fathers and the sons together, saith the LORD: I will not pity, nor spare, nor have mercy, but destroy them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> Hear ye, and give ear; be not proud: for the LORD hath spoken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> Give glory to the LORD your God, before he shall cause darkness, and before your feet stumble upon the dark mountains, and while ye look for light, he shall turn it into the shades of death, and make it gross darkness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> But if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret places for your pride; and my eye shall weep bitterly, and run down with tears, because the LORD'S flock is carried away captive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> Say to the king and to the queen, Humble yourselves, sit down: for your principalities shall come down, even the crown of your glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> The cities of the south shall be shut up, and none shall open them; Judah shall be carried away captive all of it, it shall be wholly carried away captive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the north: where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful flock? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> What wilt thou say when he shall punish thee? for thou hast taught them to be captains, and as chief over thee: shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And if thou shalt say in thy heart, Why come these things upon me? For the greatness of thy iniquity are thy skirts uncovered, and thy heels made bare. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots? then may ye also do good, that are accustomed to do evil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> Therefore will I scatter them as the stubble that passeth away by the wind of the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> This is thy lot, the portion of thy measures from me, saith the LORD; because thou hast forgotten me, and trusted in falsehood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> Therefore will I uncover thy skirts upon thy face, that thy shame may appear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> I have seen thy adulteries, and thy neighings, the enormity of thy lewdness, and thy abominations on the hills in the fields. Woe to thee O Jerusalem! wilt thou not be made clean? when shall it once be? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> The word of the LORD that came to Jeremiah concerning the dearth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> Judah mourneth, and her gates languish; they are black to the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem is gone up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> And their nobles have sent their little ones to the waters: they came to the pits, and found no water; they returned with their vessels empty; they were ashamed and confounded, and covered their heads. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> Because the ground is chapt, for there was no rain on the earth, the plowmen were ashamed, they covered their heads. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> Yes, the hind also calved in the field, and forsook it, because there was no grass. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And the wild asses stood in the high places, they snuffed up the wind like dragons; their eyes failed, because there was no grass. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> O LORD, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou it for thy name's sake: for our backslidings are many; we have sinned against thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> O the hope of Israel, his Savior in time of trouble, why shouldst thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a way-faring man that turneth aside to tarry for a night? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> Why shouldst thou be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that cannot save? yet thou, O LORD, art in the midst of us, and we are called by thy name; leave us not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> Thus saith the LORD to this people, Thus have they loved to wander, they have not restrained their feet, therefore the LORD doth not accept them; he will now remember their iniquity, and visit their sins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> Then said the LORD to me, Pray not for this people for their good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they offer burnt-offering and an oblation, I will not accept them: but I will consume them by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence. </p>

 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> Then the LORD said to me, The prophets prophesy lies in my name: I have not sent them, neither have I commanded them, neither spoken to them: they prophesy to you a false vision and divination, and a thing of naught, and the deceit of their heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, yet they say, Sword and famine shall not be in this land; By sword and famine shall those prophets be consumed. </p>

 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> Therefore thou shalt say this word to them; Let my eyes run down with tears night and day, and let them not cease: for the virgin daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a very grievous blow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> If I go forth into the field, then behold the slain with the sword! and if I enter into the city, then behold them that are sick with famine! yes, both the prophet and the priest go about into a land that they know not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> Hast thou utterly rejected Judah? hath thy soul loathed Zion? Why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing for us? we looked for peace, and there is no good; and for the time of healing, and behold trouble! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> We acknowledge, O LORD, our wickedness, and the iniquity of our fathers; for we have sinned against thee. </p>

 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> And it shall come to pass, if they say to thee, Whither shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith the LORD; Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the famine; and such as are for the captivity, to the captivity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> And I will appoint over them four kinds, saith the LORD: the sword to slay, and the dogs to tear, and the fowls of the heaven, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and destroy. </p>

 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD, If thou shalt return, then will I bring thee again, and thou shalt stand before me: and if thou shalt separate the precious from the vile, thou shalt be as my mouth: let them return to thee; but return not thou to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> And I will make thee to this people a fortified brazen wall: and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not prevail against thee: for I am with thee to save thee and to deliver thee, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> And I will deliver thee from the hand of the wicked, and I will redeem thee from the hand of the terrible. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> The word of the LORD came also to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> Thou shalt not take thee a wife, neither shalt thou have sons nor daughters in this place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> For thus saith the LORD concerning the sons and concerning the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their mothers that bore them, and concerning their fathers that begat them in this land; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> They shall die by grievous deaths; they shall not be lamented; neither shall they be buried; but they shall be as dung upon the face of the earth: and they shall be consumed by the sword, and by famine; and their carcasses shall be food for the fowls of heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> For thus saith the LORD, Enter not into the house of mourning, neither go to lament nor bemoan them: for I have taken away my peace from this people, saith the LORD, even loving-kindness and mercies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> Both the great and the small shall die in this land: they shall not be buried, neither shall men lament for them, nor cut themselves, nor make themselves bald for them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> Neither shall men tear themselves for them in mourning, to comfort them for the dead; neither shall men give them the cup of consolation to drink for their father or for their mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> Also thou shalt not go into the house of feasting, to sit with them to eat and to drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will cause to cease out of this place in your eyes, and in your days, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt show this people all these words, and they shall say to thee, Why hath the LORD pronounced all this great evil against us? or what is our iniquity? or what is our sin that we have committed against the LORD our God? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> Then shalt thou say to them, Because your fathers have forsaken me, saith the LORD, and have walked after other gods, and have served them, and have worshiped them, and have forsaken me, and have not kept my law; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> And ye have done worse than your fathers; for, behold, ye walk every one after the imagination of his evil heart, that they may not hearken to me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> Therefore will I cast you out of this land into a land that ye know not, neither ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve other gods day and night; where I will not show you favor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that it shall no more be said, The LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> But, The LORD liveth, that brought the children of Israel from the land of the north, and from all the lands whither he had driven them: and I will bring them again into their land that I gave to their fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith the LORD, and they shall fish them; and afterwards will I send for many hunters, and they shall hunt them from every mountain, and from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> For my eyes are upon all their ways: they are not hid from my face, neither is their iniquity hid from my eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin double; because they have defiled my land, they have filled my inheritance with the carcasses of their detestable and abominable things. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> O LORD, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the day of affliction, the Gentiles shall come to thee from the ends of the earth, and shall say, Surely our fathers have inherited lies, vanity, and things in which there is no profit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> Shall a man make gods to himself, and they are no gods? </p>

 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> The sin of Judah is written with a pen of iron, and with the point of a diamond: it is graven upon the table of their heart, and upon the horns of your altars; </p>

 <p><a name="an_17:20">17:20</a> And say to them, Hear ye the word of the LORD, ye kings of Judah, and all Judah, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, that enter by these gates: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> Thus saith the LORD; Take heed to yourselves, and bear no burden on the sabbath day, nor bring it in by the gates of Jerusalem; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> Neither carry forth a burden out of your houses on the sabbath day, neither do ye any work, but hallow ye the sabbath day, as I commanded your fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> But they obeyed not, neither inclined their ear, but made their neck stiff, that they might not hear, nor receive instruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:24">17:24</a> And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken to me, saith the LORD, to bring in no burden through the gates of this city on the sabbath day, but hallow the sabbath day, to do no work therein; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:25">17:25</a> Then shall there enter into the gates of this city kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall remain for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:26">17:26</a> And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the places about Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and from the plain, and from the mountains, and from the south, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and meat-offerings, and incense, and bringing sacrifices of praise, to the house of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:27">17:27</a> But if ye will not hearken to me to hallow the sabbath day, and not to bear a burden, even entering at the gates of Jerusalem on the sabbath day; then will I kindle a fire in its gates, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem, and it shall not be quenched. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> Arise, and go down to the potter's house, and there I will cause thee to hear my words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> Then I went down to the potter's house, and behold, he wrought a work on the wheels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> And the vessel that he made of clay was marred in the hand of the potter: so he made it again another vessel, as it seemed good to the potter to make it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> Then the word of the LORD came to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> O house of Israel, cannot I do with you as this potter? saith the LORD. Behold, as the clay is in the potter's hand, so are ye in my hand, O house of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> At what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy it; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> If that nation against which I have pronounced, shall turn from their evil, I will repent of the evil that I thought to do to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And at what instant I shall speak concerning a nation, and concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant it; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> If it shall do evil in my sight, that it obey not my voice, then I will repent of the good, with which I said I would benefit them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> Now therefore come, speak to the men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I frame evil against you, and devise a device against you: return ye now every one from his evil way, and make your ways and your doings good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And they said, There is no hope: but we will walk after our own devices, and we will every one do the imagination of his evil heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ask ye now among the heathen, who hath heard such things: the virgin of Israel hath done a very horrible thing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> Will a man leave the snow of Lebanon which cometh from the rock of the field? or shall the cold flowing waters that come from another place be forsaken? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> Because my people hath forgotten me, they have burned incense to vanity, and they have caused them to stumble in their ways from the ancient paths, to walk in paths, in a way not cast up; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> To make their land desolate, and a perpetual hissing; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished, and wag his head. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> I will scatter them as with an east wind before the enemy; I will show them the back, and not the face, in the day of their calamity. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> Then said they, Come, and let us devise devices against Jeremiah; for the law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel from the wise, nor the word from the prophet. Come, and let us smite him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> Give heed to me, O LORD, and hearken to the voice of them that contend with me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> Shall evil be recompensed for good? for they have digged a pit for my soul. Remember that I stood before thee to speak good for them, and to turn away thy wrath from them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> Therefore deliver their children to the famine, and pour out their blood by the force of the sword; and let their wives be bereaved of their children, and be widows; and let their men be put to death; let their young men be slain by the sword in battle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt bring a troop suddenly upon them: for they have digged a pit to take me, and hid snares for my feet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> Yet, LORD, thou knowest all their counsel against me to slay me: forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee; deal thus with them in the time of thy anger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> Thus saith the LORD, Go and get a potter's earthen bottle, and take of the ancients of the people, and of the ancients of the priests; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> And go forth to the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is by the entry of the east gate, and proclaim there the words that I shall tell thee, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And say, Hear ye the word of the LORD, O kings of Judah, and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, which whoever heareth, his ears shall tingle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> Because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this place, and have burned incense in it to other gods, whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings of Judah, and have filled this place with the blood of innocents; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> They have built also the high places of Baal, to burn their sons with fire for burnt-offerings to Baal, which I commanded not, nor spoke it, neither came it into my mind: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> Therefore behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that this place shall no more be called Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom, but The valley of slaughter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before their enemies, and by the hands of them that seek their lives: and their carcasses will I give to be food for the fowls of the heaven, and for the beasts of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And I will make this city desolate, and a hissing; every one that passeth by it shall be astonished and hiss because of all its plagues. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat every one the flesh of his friend in the siege and distress with which their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall distress them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> Then shalt thou break the bottle in the sight of the men that go with thee, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Even so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again: and they shall bury them in Tophet, till there be no place to bury. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> Thus will I do to this place, saith the LORD, and to its inhabitants, and even make this city as Tophet: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> And the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses of the kings of Judah, shall be defiled as the place of Tophet, because of all the houses upon whose roofs they have burned incense to all the host of heaven, and have poured out drink-offerings to other gods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> Then came Jeremiah from Tophet, whither the LORD had sent him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of the LORD'S house; and said to all the people, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon this city and upon all her towns all the evil that I have pronounced against it, because they have hardened their necks, that they might not hear my words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> Now Pashur the son of Immer the priest, who was also chief governor in the house of the LORD, heard that Jeremiah prophesied these things. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> Then Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the stocks that were in the high gate of Benjamin, which was by the house of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Pashur brought forth Jeremiah out of the stocks. Then said Jeremiah to him, The LORD hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> For thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will make thee a terror to thyself, and to all thy friends: and they shall fall by the sword of their enemies, and thy eyes shall behold it: and I will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall slay them with the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> Moreover I will deliver all the strength of this city, and all its labors, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah will I give into the hand of their enemies, who shall pillage them, and take them, and carry them to Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go into captivity: and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou shalt die, and shalt be buried there, thou, and all thy friends, to whom thou hast prophesied lies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> O LORD, thou hast deceived me, and I was deceived: thou art stronger than I, and hast prevailed: I am in derision daily, every one mocketh me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> For since I spoke, I cried out, I cried violence and spoil; because the word of the LORD was made a reproach to me, and a derision, daily. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> Then I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any more in his name. But his word was in my heart as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could not stay. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> For I heard the defaming of many, fear on every side. Report, say they, and we will report it. All my familiars watched for my halting, saying, Perhaps he will be enticed, and we shall prevail against him, and we shall take our revenge on him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> But the LORD is with me as a mighty terrible one: therefore my persecutors shall stumble, and they shall not prevail: they shall be greatly ashamed; for they shall not prosper: their everlasting confusion shall never be forgotten. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> But, O LORD of hosts, that triest the righteous, and seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on them: for to thee have I opened my cause. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> Sing to the LORD, praise ye the LORD: for he hath delivered the soul of the poor from the hand of evil-doers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> Cursed be the day in which I was born: let not the day in which my mother bore me be blessed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> Cursed be the man who brought tidings to my father, saying, A male child is born to thee; making him very glad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> And let that man be as the cities which the LORD overthrew, and repented not: and let him hear the cry in the morning, and the shouting at noon; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> Because he slew me not at my birth; or that my mother might have been my grave, and she had not been delivered. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> Why was I brought into the world to see labor and sorrow, that my days should be consumed with shame? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when king Zedekiah sent to him Pashur the son of Melchiah, and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> Inquire, I pray thee, of the LORD for us; for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon maketh war against us; it may be that the LORD will deal with us according to all his wondrous works, that he may go up from us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> Then said Jeremiah to them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> Thus saith the LORD God of Israel; Behold, I will turn back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which ye fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans, who besiege you without the walls, and I will assemble them into the midst of this city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And I myself will fight against you with an out-stretched hand and with a strong arm, even in anger, and in fury, and in great wrath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and beast; they shall die by a great pestilence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And afterward, saith the LORD, I will deliver Zedekiah king of Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the famine, into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those that seek their life; and he shall smite them with the edge of the sword; he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have mercy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And to this people thou shalt say, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth out, and falleth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and his life shall be to him for a prey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not for good, saith the LORD: it shall be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And concerning the house of the king of Judah, say, Hear ye the word of the LORD; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> O house of David, thus saith the LORD; Execute judgment in the morning, and deliver him that is made desolate out of the hand of the oppressor, lest my fury go out like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the evil of your doings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> Behold, I am against thee, O inhabitant of the valley, and rock of the plain, saith the LORD; who say, Who shall come down against us? or who shall enter into our habitations? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> But I will punish you according to the fruit of your doings, saith the LORD: and I will kindle a fire in the forest thereof, and it shall devour all things around it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> Thus saith the LORD; Go down to the house of the king of Judah, and speak there this word, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And say, Hear the word of the LORD, O king of Judah, that sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and thy people that enter by these gates: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> Thus saith the LORD; Execute ye judgment and righteousness, and deliver him that is laid waste out of the hand of the oppressor: and do no wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, nor the widow, neither shed innocent blood in this place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter, by the gates of this house, kings sitting upon the throne of David, riding in chariots and on horses, he, and his servants, and his people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> But if ye will not hear these words, I swear by myself, saith the LORD, that this house shall become a desolation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> For thus saith the LORD to the king's house of Judah; Thou art Gilead to me, and the head of Lebanon; yet surely I will make thee a wilderness, and cities which are not inhabited. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with his weapons: and they shall cut down thy choice cedars, and cast them into the fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall say every man to his neighbor, Why hath the LORD done thus to this great city? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> Then they shall answer, Because they have forsaken the covenant of the LORD their God, and worshiped other gods, and served them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> Weep ye not for the dead, neither bemoan him: but weep bitterly for him that goeth away: for he shall return no more, nor see his native country. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> For thus saith the LORD concerning Shallum the son of Josiah king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his father, who went forth from this place; He shall not return thither any more: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> But he shall die in the place whither they have led him captive, and shall see this land no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> Woe to him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness, and his chambers by wrong; that useth his neighbor's service without wages, and giveth him not for his work; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> That saith, I will build me a wide house and large chambers, and cutteth him out windows; and it is ceiled with cedar, and painted with vermilion. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> Shalt thou reign, because thou closest thyself in cedar? did not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice, and then it was well with him? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was well with him: was not this to know me? saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> But thy eyes and thy heart are only for thy covetousness, and for shedding innocent blood, and for oppression, and for violence, to do it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah; They shall not lament for him, saying, Ah my brother! or, Ah sister! they shall not lament for him, saying, Ah lord! or, Ah his glory! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, drawn and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and lift up thy voice in Bashan, and cry from the passages: for all thy lovers are destroyed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> I spoke to thee in thy prosperity; but thou saidest, I will not hear. This hath been thy manner from thy youth, that thou hast not obeyed my voice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> The wind shall eat up all thy pastors, and thy lovers shall go into captivity: surely then shalt thou be ashamed and confounded for all thy wickedness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> O inhabitant of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the cedars, how gracious shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee, the pain as of a woman in travail! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> As I live, saith the LORD, though Coniah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah were the signet upon my right hand, yet would I pluck thee thence; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> And I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy life, and into the hand of them whose face thou fearest, even into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and into the hand of the Chaldeans. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bore thee, into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall ye die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> But to the land to which they desire to return, thither shall they not return. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> Is this man Coniah a despised broken idol? is he a vessel in which is no pleasure? why are they cast out, he and his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> Thus saith the LORD, Write ye this man childless, a man that shall not prosper in his days: for no man of his seed shall prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more in Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> Woe be to the pastors that destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture! saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of Israel against the pastors that feed my people; Ye have scattered my flock, and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And I will gather the remnant of my flock from all countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again to their folds; and they shall be fruitful and increase. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And I will set shepherds over them who shall feed them: and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall they be lacking, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will raise to David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice upon the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell in safety: and this is his name by which he shall be called, JEHOVAH OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that they shall no more say, The LORD liveth, who brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> But, the LORD liveth, who brought and who led the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and from all countries whither I have driven them; and they shall dwell in their own land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> My heart within me is broken because of the prophets; all my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom wine hath overcome, because of the LORD, and because of the words of his holiness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> For the land is full of adulterers; for because of swearing the land mourneth; the pleasant places of the wilderness are dried up, and their course is evil, and their force is not right. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> For both prophet and priest are profane; even in my house have I found their wickedness, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> Wherefore their way shall be to them as slippery ways in the darkness: they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for I will bring evil upon them, even the year of their visitation, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria; they prophesied in Baal, and caused my people Israel to err. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> I have seen also in the prophets of Jerusalem a horrible thing: they commit adultery, and walk in lies: they strengthen also the hands of evil-doers, that none doth return from his wickedness: they are all of them to me as Sodom, and the inhabitants of it as Gomorrah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the prophets; Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them drink the water of gall: for from the prophets of Jerusalem is profaneness gone forth into all the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Hearken not to the words of the prophets that prophesy to you: they make you vain: they speak a vision of their own heart, and not from the mouth of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> They say still to them that despise me, The LORD hath said, Ye shall have peace; and they say to every one that walketh after the imagination of his own heart, No evil shall come upon you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> For who hath stood in the counsel of the LORD, and hath perceived and heard his word? who hath marked his word, and heard it? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> Behold, a whirlwind of the LORD is gone forth in fury, even a grievous whirlwind: it shall fall grievously upon the head of the wicked. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> The anger of the LORD shall not return, until he shall have executed, and till he shall have performed the thoughts of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it perfectly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> I have not sent these prophets, yet they ran: I have not spoken to them, yet they prophesied. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:22">23:22</a> But if they had stood in my counsel, and had caused my people to hear my words, then they would have turned them from their evil way, and from the evil of their doings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> Am I a God at hand, saith the LORD, and not a God afar off. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall not see him? saith the LORD. Do not I fill heaven and earth? saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> I have heard what the prophets said, that prophesy lies in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> How long shall this be in the heart of the prophets that prophesy lies? yes, they are prophets of the deceit of their own heart; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> Who think to cause my people to forget my name by their dreams which they tell every man to his neighbor, as their fathers have forgotten my name for Baal. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the wheat? saith the LORD? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> Is not my word like a fire? saith the LORD? and like a hammer that breaketh the rock in pieces? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:30">23:30</a> Therefore behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that steal my words every one from his neighbor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:31">23:31</a> Behold, I am against the prophets, saith the LORD, that use their tongues, and say, He saith. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:32">23:32</a> Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams, saith the LORD, and do tell them, and cause my people to err by their lies, and by their lightness; yet I sent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they shall not profit this people at all, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:33">23:33</a> And when this people, or the prophet, or a priest, shall ask thee, saying, What is the burden of the LORD? thou shalt then say to them, What burden? I will even forsake you, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:34">23:34</a> And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people that shall say, The burden of the LORD, I will even punish that man and his house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:35">23:35</a> Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbor, and every one to his brother, What hath the LORD answered? and, What hath the LORD spoken? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:36">23:36</a> And the burden of the LORD shall ye mention no more: for every man's word shall be his burden; for ye have perverted the words of the living God, of the LORD of hosts our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:37">23:37</a> Thus shalt thou say to the prophet, What hath the LORD answered thee? and, What hath the LORD spoken? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:38">23:38</a> But since ye say, The burden of the LORD; therefore thus saith the LORD; Because ye say this word, The burden of the LORD, and I have sent to you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden of the LORD; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:39">23:39</a> Therefore behold, I, even I, will utterly forget you, and I will forsake you, and the city that I gave to you and your fathers, and cast you out of my presence: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:40">23:40</a> And I will bring an everlasting reproach upon you, and a perpetual shame, which shall not be forgotten. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> The LORD showed me, and behold, two baskets of figs were set before the temple of the LORD, after Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and the princes of Judah, with the carpenters and smiths, from Jerusalem, and had brought them to Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> One basket had very good figs, even like the figs that are first ripe: and the other basket had very poor figs, which could not be eaten, they were so bad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> Then said the LORD to me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? and I said, Figs; the good figs, very good; and the bad, very bad, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> Again the word of the LORD came to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Like these good figs, so will I acknowledge them that are carried away captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the land of the Chaldeans for their good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> For I will set my eyes upon them for good, and I will bring them again to this land: and I will build them, and not pull them down; and I will plant them, and not pluck them up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am the LORD: and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they shall return to me with their whole heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten, they are so bad; surely thus saith the LORD, So will I give Zedekiah the king of Judah, and his princes, and the residue of Jerusalem, that remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> And I will deliver them to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth for their hurt, to be a reproach and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I shall drive them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> And I will send the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, among them, till they are consumed from off the land that I gave to them and to their fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that was the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> Which Jeremiah the prophet spoke to all the people of Judah, and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon king of Judah, even to this day, that is the three and twentieth year, the word of the LORD hath come to me, and I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> And the LORD hath sent to you all his servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye have not hearkened, nor inclined your ear to hear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> They said, Turn ye again now every one from his evil way, and from the evil of your doings, and dwell in the land that the LORD hath given to you and to your fathers for ever and ever: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> And go not after other gods to serve them, and to worship them, and provoke me not to anger with the works of your hands; and I will do you no hurt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> Yet ye have not hearkened to me, saith the LORD; that ye might provoke me to anger with the works of your hands to your own hurt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Because ye have not heard my words, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> Behold, I will send and take all the families of the north, saith the LORD, and Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and against its inhabitants, and against all these nations around, and will utterly destroy them, and make them an astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual desolations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> Moreover I will take from them the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the sound of the millstones, and the light of the candle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> And this whole land shall be a desolation, and an astonishment; and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are accomplished, that I will punish the king of Babylon, and that nation, saith the LORD, for their iniquity, and the land of the Chaldeans, and will make it perpetual desolations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have pronounced against it, even all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> For many nations and great kings shall reduce them to subjection also: and I will recompense them according to their deeds, and according to the works of their own hands. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:15">25:15</a> For thus saith the LORD God of Israel to me; Take the wine cup of this fury at my hand, and cause all the nations, to whom I send thee, to drink it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a> And they shall drink, and be moved, and enraged, because of the sword that I will send among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:17">25:17</a> Then I took the cup at the LORD'S hand, and made all the nations to drink, to whom the LORD had sent me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> To wit, Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and her kings, and her princes, to make them a desolation, an astonishment, a hissing, and a curse; as it is this day; </p>

 <p><a name="an_25:27">25:27</a> Therefore thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Drink ye, and be drunken, and vomit, and fall, and rise no more, because of the sword which I will send among you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:28">25:28</a> And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup at thy hand to drink, then shalt thou say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ye shall certainly drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:29">25:29</a> For lo, I begin to bring evil on the city which is called by my name, and should ye be utterly unpunished? Ye shall not be unpunished: for I will call for a sword upon all the inhabitants of the earth, saith the LORD of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:30">25:30</a> Therefore prophesy thou against them all these words, and say to them, The LORD shall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he shall mightily roar upon his habitation; he shall give a shout, as they that tread the grapes, against all the inhabitants of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:31">25:31</a> A noise shall come even to the ends of the earth; for the LORD hath a controversy with the nations, he will plead with all flesh; he will give them that are wicked to the sword, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:32">25:32</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, evil shall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind shall be raised from the borders of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:33">25:33</a> And the slain of the LORD shall be at that day from one end of the earth even to the other end of the earth: they shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall be dung upon the ground. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:34">25:34</a> Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves in the ashes, ye principal of the flock: for the days of your slaughter and of your dispersions are accomplished; and ye shall fall like a pleasant vessel. </p>

 <p><a name="an_25:36">25:36</a> A voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a howling of the principal of the flock, shall be heard: for the LORD hath laid waste their pasture. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:37">25:37</a> And the peaceable habitations are cut down, because of the fierce anger of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:38">25:38</a> He hath forsaken his covert, as the lion: for their land is desolate because of the fierceness of the oppressor, and because of his fierce anger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah came this word from the LORD, saying, </p>

 <p><a name="an_26:3">26:3</a> It may be they will hearken, and turn every man from his evil way, that I may repent of the evil, which I purpose to do to them because of the evil of their doings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:4">26:4</a> And thou shalt say to them, Thus saith the LORD, If ye will not hearken to me to walk in my law, which I have set before you, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:5">26:5</a> To hearken to the words of my servants the prophets, whom I have sent to you, both rising early, and sending them, but ye have not hearkened; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:6">26:6</a> Then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make this city a curse to all the nations of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:7">26:7</a> So the priests and the prophets, and all the people heard Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:8">26:8</a> Now it came to pass, when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking all that the LORD had commanded him to speak to all the people, that the priests and the prophets and all the people took him, saying, Thou shalt surely die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:9">26:9</a> Why hast thou prophesied in the name of the LORD, saying, This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be desolate without an inhabitant? And all the people were gathered against Jeremiah, in the house of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:10">26:10</a> When the princes of Judah heard these things, then they came up from the king's house to the house of the LORD, and sat down in the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:11">26:11</a> Then the priests and the prophets spoke to the princes and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die; for he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with your ears. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:12">26:12</a> Then Jeremiah spoke to all the princes, and to all the people, saying, The LORD sent me to prophesy against this house and against this city all the words that ye have heard. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:13">26:13</a> Therefore now amend your ways and your doings, and obey the voice of the LORD your God; and the LORD will repent of the evil that he hath pronounced against you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:14">26:14</a> As for me, behold, I am in your hand: do with me as it seemeth good and meet to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:15">26:15</a> But know ye for certain, that if ye put me to death, ye will surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, upon this city, and upon its inhabitants: for of a truth the LORD hath sent me to you to speak all these words in your ears. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:16">26:16</a> Then said the princes and all the people to the priests and to the prophets; This man is not worthy to die: for he hath spoken to us in the name of the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:17">26:17</a> Then arose certain of the elders of the land, and spoke to all the assembly of the people, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:18">26:18</a> Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Zion shall be plowed like a field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high places of the forest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:19">26:19</a> Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him to death? did he not fear the LORD, and beseech the LORD, and the LORD repented of the evil which he had pronounced against them? Thus might we procure great evil against our souls. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:20">26:20</a> And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of the LORD, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim, who prophesied against this city and against this land according to all the words of Jeremiah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:21">26:21</a> And when Jehoiakim the king, with all his mighty men, and all the princes, heard his words, the king sought to put him to death: but when Urijah heard it, he was afraid, and fled, and went into Egypt; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:22">26:22</a> And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, namely, Elnathan the son of Achbor, and certain men with him into Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:23">26:23</a> And they brought forth Urijah from Egypt, and brought him to Jehoiakim the king; who slew him with the sword, and cast his dead body into the graves of the common people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:24">26:24</a> Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of the people to put him to death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:1">27:1</a> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:2">27:2</a> Thus saith the LORD to me; Make for thee bonds and yokes, and put them upon thy neck, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:3">27:3</a> And send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab, and to the king of the Ammonites, and to the king of Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers who come to Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:4">27:4</a> And command them to say to their masters, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to your masters; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> I have made the earth, the man and the beast that are upon the ground, by my great power and by my out-stretched arm, and have given it to whom it seemed meet to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> And now have I given all these lands into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of the field have I given him also to serve him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> And all nations shall serve him, and his son, and his son's son, until the very time of his land shall come: and then many nations and great kings shall bring him into subjection. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, that nation will I punish, saith the LORD, with the sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I have consumed them by his hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> Therefore hearken ye not to your prophets, nor to your diviners, nor to your dreamers, nor to your enchanters, nor to your sorcerers, who speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:10">27:10</a> For they prophesy a lie to you, to remove you far from your land; and that I should drive you out, and ye should perish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:11">27:11</a> But the nations that bring their neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him, those will I let remain still in their own land, saith the LORD; and they shall till it, and dwell in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:12">27:12</a> I spoke also to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all these words, saying, Bring your necks under the yoke of the king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:13">27:13</a> Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, as the LORD hath spoken against the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:14">27:14</a> Therefore hearken not to the words of the prophets that speak to you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for they prophesy a lie to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:15">27:15</a> For I have not sent them, saith the LORD, yet they prophesy a lie in my name; that I might drive you out, and that ye might perish, ye, and the prophets that prophesy to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:16">27:16</a> Also I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Hearken not to the words of your prophets that prophesy to you, saying, Behold, the vessels of the LORD'S house shall now shortly be brought again from Babylon: for they prophesy a lie to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:17">27:17</a> Hearken not to them; serve the king of Babylon, and live: why should this city be laid waste? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:18">27:18</a> But if they are prophets, and if the word of the LORD is with them, let them now make intercession to the LORD of hosts, that the vessels which are left in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:19">27:19</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts concerning the pillars, and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and concerning the residue of the vessels that remain in this city, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:20">27:20</a> Which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah from Jerusalem to Babylon, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:21">27:21</a> Yes, thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning the vessels that remain in the house of the LORD, and in the house of the king of Judah and of Jerusalem; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:22">27:22</a> They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be until the day that I visit them, saith the LORD; then will I bring them up, and restore them to this place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, and in the fifth month, that Hananiah the son of Azur the prophet, who was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of the LORD, in the presence of the priests, and of all the people, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:3">28:3</a> Within two full years will I bring again into this place all the vessels of the LORD'S house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took away from this place, and carried them to Babylon: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a> And I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah, that went into Babylon, saith the LORD; for I will break the yoke of the king of Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a> Then the prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah in the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the people that stood in the house of the LORD, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a> Even the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen: the LORD do so: the LORD perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring again the vessels of the LORD'S house, and all that is carried away captive, from Babylon into this place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a> Nevertheless, now hear thou this word that I speak in thy ears, and in the ears of all the people: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a> The prophets that have been before me and before thee of old prophesied both against many countries, and against great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> The prophet who prophesieth of peace, when the word of the prophet shall come to pass, then shall the prophet be known, that the LORD hath truly sent him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke from off the prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a> And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Even so will I break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all nations within the space of two full years. And the prophet Jeremiah went his way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:12">28:12</a> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after Hananiah the prophet had broken the yoke from off the neck of the prophet Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast broken the yokes of wood; but thou shalt make for them yokes of iron. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; I have put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> Then said the prophet Jeremiah to Hananiah the prophet, Hear now, Hananiah; The LORD hath not sent thee; but thou makest this people to trust in a lie. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will cast thee from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, because thou hast taught rebellion against the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:17">28:17</a> So Hananiah the prophet died the same year in the seventh month. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:1">29:1</a> Now these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders who were carried away captives, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive from Jerusalem to Babylon; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:2">29:2</a> (After Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the carpenters, and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem;) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:3">29:3</a> By the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the son of Hilkiah, (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon) saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, to all that are carried away captives, whom I have caused to be carried away from Jerusalem to Babylon; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> Build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> Take ye wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they may bear sons and daughters; that ye may be increased there, and not diminished. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to be carried away captives, and pray to the LORD for it: for in the peace of it ye shall have peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Let not your prophets and your diviners, that are in the midst of you, deceive you, neither hearken to your dreams which ye cause to be dreamed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> For they prophesy falsely to you in my name: I have not sent them, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> For thus saith the LORD, That after seventy years shall be accomplished at Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good word towards you, in causing you to return to this place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:11">29:11</a> For I know the thoughts that I think towards you, saith the LORD, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you an expected end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> Then shall ye call upon me, and ye shall go and pray to me, and I will hearken to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> And ye shall seek me, and find me, when ye shall search for me with all your heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> And I will be found by you, saith the LORD: and I will turn away your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and from all the places whither I have driven you, saith the LORD: and I will bring you again into the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> Because ye have said, The LORD hath raised up for us prophets in Babylon; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> Know that thus saith the LORD concerning the king that sitteth upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that dwelleth in this city, and concerning your brethren that are not gone forth with you into captivity; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will send upon them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make them like vile figs, that cannot be eaten, they are so bad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> And I will persecute them with the sword, with the famine, and with the pestilence, and will deliver them to be removed to all the kingdoms of the earth, to be a curse, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach, among all the nations whither I have driven them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> Because they have not hearkened to my words, saith the LORD, which I sent to them by my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them; but ye would not hear, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> Hear ye therefore the word of the LORD, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from Jerusalem to Babylon: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of Maaseiah, who prophesy a lie to you in my name; Behold, I will deliver them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon; and he shall slay them before your eyes; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> And concerning them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity of Judah who are in Babylon, saying, The LORD make thee like Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the fire; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> Because they have committed villainy in Israel, and have committed adultery with their neighbor's wives, and have spoken lying words in my name, which I have not commanded them; even I know, and am a witness, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> Thus shalt thou also speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Because thou hast sent letters in thy name to all the people that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest, and to all the priests, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> The LORD hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the priest, that ye should be officers in the house of the LORD, for every man that is mad, and maketh himself a prophet, that thou shouldest put him in prison, and in the stocks. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> Now therefore why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth, who maketh himself a prophet to you? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:28">29:28</a> For therefore he sent to us in Babylon, saying, This captivity is long: build ye houses, and dwell in them; and plant gardens, and eat the fruit of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:29">29:29</a> And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears of Jeremiah the prophet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:30">29:30</a> Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:31">29:31</a> Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith the LORD concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite; Because Shemaiah hath prophesied to you, and I sent him not, and he caused you to trust in a lie: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:32">29:32</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will punish Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man to dwell among this people; neither shall he behold the good that I will do for my people, saith the LORD; because he hath taught rebellion against the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> Thus speaketh the LORD God of Israel, saying, Write for thee all the words that I have spoken to thee in a book. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> For lo, the days come, saith the LORD; that I will bring again the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith the LORD: and I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their fathers, and they shall possess it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> And these are the words that the LORD spoke concerning Israel and concerning Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> For thus saith the LORD; We have heard a voice of trembling, of fear, and not of peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> Ask ye now, and see whether a man doth travail with child? Why do I see every man with his hands on his loins, as a woman in travail, and all faces are turned into paleness? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is even the time of Jacob's trouble, but he shall be saved out of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> For it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of hosts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst thy bonds, and strangers shall no more bring him into subjection: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> But they shall serve the LORD their God, and David their king, whom I will raise up to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> Therefore fear thou not, O my servant Jacob, saith the LORD; neither be dismayed, O Israel: for lo, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and quiet, and none shall make him afraid. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> For I am with thee, saith the LORD, to save thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have scattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee: but I will correct thee in measure, and will not leave thee altogether unpunished. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> For thus saith the LORD, Thy bruise is incurable, and thy wound is grievous. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> There is none to plead thy cause, that thou mayest be bound up: thou hast no healing medicines. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not; for I have wounded thee with the wound of an enemy, with the chastisements of a cruel one, for the multitude of thy iniquity; because thy sins were increased. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> Why criest thou for thy affliction? thy sorrow is incurable for the multitude of thy iniquity: because thy sins were increased, I have done these things to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> Therefore all they that devour thee shall be devoured; and all thy adversaries, every one of them shall go into captivity; and they that plunder thee shall be a spoil, and all that prey upon thee will I give for a prey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> For I will restore health to thee, and I will heal thee of thy wounds, saith the LORD; because they called thee an Outcast, saying, This is Zion, whom no man seeketh after. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will bring again the captivity of Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his dwelling places; and the city shall be built upon her own heap, and the palace shall remain after its manner. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving and the voice of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they shall not be few; I will also glorify them, and they shall not be small. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> Their children also shall be as in former time, and their congregation shall be established before me, and I will punish all that oppress them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> And their nobles shall be from themselves, and their governor shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to draw near, and he shall approach time: for who is this that engaged his heart to approach to me? saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> Behold, the whirlwind of the LORD goeth forth with fury, a continuing whirlwind: it shall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> The fierce anger of the LORD shall not return, until he hath done it, and until he hath performed the intents of his heart: in the latter days ye shall consider it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> At the same time, saith the LORD, I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they shall be my people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> Thus saith the LORD, The people who were left by the sword found grace in the wilderness; even Israel, when I went to cause him to rest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> The LORD appeared of old to me, saying, I have loved thee with an everlasting love: therefore with loving-kindness have I drawn thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> Again I will build thee, and thou shalt be built, O virgin of Israel; thou shalt again be adorned with thy tabrets, and shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> Thou shalt yet plant vines upon the mountains of Samaria: the planters shall plant, and shall eat them as common things. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> For there shall be a day, that the watchmen upon the mount Ephraim shall cry, Arise ye, and let us go up to Zion to the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> For thus saith the LORD; Sing with gladness for Jacob, and shout among the chief of the nations: publish ye, praise ye, and say, O LORD, save thy people, the remnant of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> Behold, I will bring them from the north country, and gather them from the borders of the earth, and with them the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that travaileth with child together: a great company shall return thither. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I lead them: I will cause them to walk by the rivers of waters in a straight way, wherein they shall not stumble: for I am a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my first-born. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> Hear the word of the LORD, O ye nations, and declare it in the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd doth his flock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> For the LORD hath redeemed Jacob, and ransomed him from the hand of him that was stronger than he. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> Therefore they shall come and sing in the hight of Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of the LORD, for wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young of the flock and of the herd: and their soul shall be as a watered garden; and they shall not sorrow any more at all. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, both young men and old together: for I will turn their mourning into joy, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice from their sorrow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness, and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> Thus saith the LORD; A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, and bitter weeping; Rachel weeping for her children refused to be comforted for her children, because they were not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> Thus saith the LORD; Refrain thy voice from weeping, and thy eyes from tears: for thy work shall be rewarded, saith the LORD; and they shall come again from the land of the enemy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> And there is hope in thy end, saith the LORD, that thy children shall come again to their own border. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> I have surely heard Ephraim bemoaning himself thus; Thou hast chastised me, and I was chastised, as a bullock unaccustomed to the yoke: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art the LORD my God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> Surely after I was turned, I repented; and after I was instructed, I smote upon my thigh: I was ashamed, and even confounded, because I bore the reproach of my youth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> Is Ephraim my dear son? is he a pleasant child? for since I spoke against him, I do earnestly remember him still: therefore my bowels are troubled for him; I will surely have mercy upon him, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> Set thee up way-marks, make thee high heaps: set thy heart towards the highway, even the way which thou wentest; turn again, O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> How long wilt thou wander about, O thou backsliding daughter? for the LORD hath created a new thing in the earth, A woman shall compass a man. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As yet they shall use this speech in the land of Judah and in her cities, when I shall bring again their captivity; The LORD bless thee, O habitation of justice, mountain of holiness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> And there shall dwell in Judah itself, and in all her cities together, husbandmen, and they that go forth with flocks. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> For I have satiated the weary soul, and I have replenished every sorrowful soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> Behold, the days come saith the LORD, that I will sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah with the seed of man, and with the seed of beast. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> And it shall come to pass, that as I have watched over them, to pluck up, and to break down, and to throw down, and to destroy, and to afflict; so will I watch over them, to build and to plant, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have eaten a sour grape, and the children's teeth are set on edge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> But every one shall die for his own iniquity: every man that eateth the sour grape, his teeth shall be set on edge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:31">31:31</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:32">31:32</a> Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke, although I was a husband to them, saith the LORD: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:33">31:33</a> But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; After those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:34">31:34</a> And they shall teach no more every man his neighbor, and every man his brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:35">31:35</a> Thus saith the LORD, who giveth the sun for a light by day, and the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for a light by night, who divideth the sea when its waves roar; The LORD of hosts is his name: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:36">31:36</a> If those ordinances depart from before me, saith the LORD, then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:37">31:37</a> Thus saith the LORD; If heaven above can be measured, and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:38">31:38</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the city shall be built to the LORD from the tower of Hananeel to the gate of the corner. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:39">31:39</a> And the measuring line shall yet go forth over against it upon the hill Gareb, and shall compass about to Goath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:40">31:40</a> And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes, and all the fields to the brook of Kidron, to the corner of the horse-gate towards the east, shall be holy to the LORD; it shall not be plucked up, nor thrown down any more for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the tenth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, which was the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> For then the king of Babylon's army besieged Jerusalem: and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the court of the prison, which was in the king of Judah's house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> For Zedekiah king of Judah had confined him, saying, Why dost thou prophesy, and say, Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall take it; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> And Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape from the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall surely be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> And he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he be until I visit him, saith the LORD: though ye fight with the Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> And Jeremiah said, The word of the LORD came to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> Behold, Hanameel the son of Shallum thy uncle shall come to thee, saying, Buy for thee my field that is in Anathoth: for the right of redemption is thine to buy it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> So Hanameel my uncle's son came to me in the court of the prison, according to the word of the LORD, and said to me, Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the country of Benjamin: for the right of inheritance is thine, and the redemption is thine; buy it for thyself. Then I knew that this was the word of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> And I bought the field of Hanameel my uncle's son, that was in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, even seventeen shekels of silver. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> And I subscribed the contract, and sealed it, and took witnesses, and weighed him the money in the balances. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> So I took the evidence of the purchase, both that which was sealed according to the law and custom, and that which was open: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> And I gave the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel my uncle's son, and in the presence of the witnesses that subscribed the book of the purchase, before all the Jews that sat in the court of the prison. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> And I charged Baruch before them, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Take these evidences, this evidence of the purchase, both that which is sealed, and this evidence which is open; and put them in an earthen vessel, that they may continue many days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Houses and fields and vineyards shall be possessed again in this land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> Now when I had delivered the evidence of the purchase to Baruch the son of Neriah, I prayed to the LORD, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> Ah Lord GOD! behold, thou hast made the heaven and the earth by thy great power and out-stretched arm, and there is nothing too hard for thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> Thou showest loving-kindness to thousands, and recompensest the iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after them: the Great, the Mighty God, JEHOVAH of hosts, is his name, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> Great in counsel, and mighty in work: for thy eyes are open upon all the ways of the sons of men: to give every one according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> Who hast set signs and wonders in the land of Egypt, even to this day, and in Israel, and among other men; and hast made thee a name, as at this day; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> And hast brought forth thy people Israel from the land of Egypt with signs, and with wonders, and with a strong hand, and with an out-stretched arm, and with great terror; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> And hast given them this land, which thou didst swear to their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> And they came in, and possessed it; but they obeyed not thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do: therefore thou hast caused all this evil to come upon them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> Behold the mounts, they are come to the city to take it; and the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans, that fight against it, because of the sword, and of the famine, and of the pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and behold, thou seest it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> And thou hast said to me, O Lord GOD, Buy thee the field for money, and take witnesses; for the city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> Behold, I am the LORD, the God of all flesh: is there any thing too hard for me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and he shall take it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall come and set fire on this city, and burn it with the houses, upon whose roofs they have offered incense to Baal, and poured out drink-offerings to other gods, to provoke me to anger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have done evil only before me from their youth: for the children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work of their hands, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> For this city hath been to me as a provocation of my anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even to this day; that I should remove it from before my face, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> Because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> And they have turned to me the back, and not the face: though I taught them, rising early and teaching them, yet they have not hearkened to receive instruction. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> But they set their abominations in the house, which is called by my name, to defile it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> And they built the high places of Baal, which are in the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause their sons and their daughters to pass through the fire to Molech; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:36">32:36</a> And now therefore thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning this city, of which ye say, It shall be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the famine, and by the pestilence; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:37">32:37</a> Behold, I will gather them out of all countries, whither I have driven them in my anger, and in my fury, and in great wrath; and I will bring them again to this place, and I will cause them to dwell in safety. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:38">32:38</a> And they shall be my people, and I will be their God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:39">32:39</a> And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, for the good of them, and of their children after them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:40">32:40</a> And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they shall not depart from me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:41">32:41</a> Yes, I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will plant them in this land assuredly with my whole heart and with my whole soul. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:42">32:42</a> For thus saith the LORD; As I have brought all this great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the good that I have promised them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:43">32:43</a> And fields shall be bought in this land, of which ye say, It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand of the Chaldeans. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:44">32:44</a> Men shall buy fields for money, and subscribe evidences, and seal them, and take witnesses in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, and in the cities of the mountains, and in the cities of the valley, and in the cities of the south: for I will cause their captivity to return, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah the second time, while he was yet confined in the court of the prison, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> Thus saith the LORD the maker of this, the LORD that formed it, to establish it; the LORD is his name; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> Call to me, and I will answer thee, and show thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> For thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, concerning the houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of Judah, which are thrown down by the mounts, and by the sword; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but it is to fill them with the dead bodies of men, whom I have slain in my anger and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face from this city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> Behold, I will bring it health and cure, and I will cure them, and will reveal to them the abundance of peace and truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> And I will cause the captivity of Judah and the captivity of Israel to return, and will build them, as at the first. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, by which they have sinned against me; and I will pardon all their iniquities, by which they have sinned, and by which they have transgressed against me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise, and an honor before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear all the good that I do to them: and they shall fear and tremble for all the goodness and for all the prosperity that I procure to it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> Thus saith the LORD; Again there shall be heard in this place, which ye say shall be desolate without man and without beast, even in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, that are desolate, without man, and without inhabitant, and without beast, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> The voice of joy, and the voice of gladness, the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride, the voice of them that shall say, Praise the LORD of hosts: for the LORD is good; for his mercy endureth for ever: and of them that shall bring the sacrifice of praise into the house of the LORD. For I will cause to return the captivity of the land, as at the first, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Again in this place, which is desolate without man and without beast, and in all its cities, shall be a habitation of shepherds causing their flocks to lie down. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> In the cities of the mountains, in the cities of the vale, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of Benjamin, and in the places about Jerusalem, and in the cities of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him that counteth them, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will perform that good thing which I have promised to the house of Israel and to the house of Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> In those days, and at that time, will I cause the branch of righteousness to grow up to David; and he shall execute judgment and righteousness in the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell in safety: and this is the name by which she shall be called, JEHOVAH our righteousness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> For thus saith the LORD; David shall never want a man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> Neither shall the priests the Levites want a man before me to offer burnt-offerings, and to kindle meat-offerings, and to do sacrifice continually. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> And the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> Thus saith the LORD; If ye can break my covenant of the day, and my covenant of the night, so that there should not be day and night in their season; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> Then also may my covenant be broken with David my servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his throne; and with the Levites the priests, my ministers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> As the host of heaven cannot be numbered, neither the sand of the sea measured: so will I multiply the seed of David my servant, and the Levites that minister to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> Moreover the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:24">33:24</a> Considerest thou not what this people have spoken, saying, The two families which the LORD hath chosen, he hath even cast them off? thus they have despised my people, that they should be no more a nation before them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:25">33:25</a> Thus saith the LORD; If my covenant is not with day and night, and if I have not appointed the ordinances of heaven and earth; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:26">33:26</a> Then will I cast away the seed of Jacob, and David my servant, so that I will not take any of his seed to be rulers over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; for I will cause their captivity to return, and have mercy on them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the kingdoms of the earth of his dominion, and all the people fought against Jerusalem, and against all its cities, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD; Behold, I will give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> And thou shalt not escape from his hand, but shalt surely be taken, and delivered into his hand; and thy eyes shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and he shall speak with thee mouth to mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> Yet hear the word of the LORD, O Zedekiah king of Judah; Thus saith the LORD concerning thee, Thou shalt not die by the sword: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> But thou shalt die in peace: and with the burnings of thy fathers, the former kings who were before thee, so shall they burn odors for thee; and they will lament thee, saying, Ah lord! for I have pronounced the word, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all these words to Zedekiah king of Judah in Jerusalem, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> When the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem, and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against Lachish, and against Azekah: for these fortified cities remained of the cities of Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people who were at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty to them; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> That every man should liberate his man-servant, and every man his maid-servant, being a Hebrew or a Hebrewess; that none should retain them in service, to wit, a Jew his brother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> Now when all the princes, and all the people who had entered into the covenant, heard that every one should liberate his man-servant, and every one his maid-servant, that none should retain them in service any more, then they obeyed, and let them go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> But afterwards they turned, and caused the servants and the handmaids, whom they had liberated, to return, and brought them into subjection for servants and for handmaids. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> Therefore the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; I made a covenant with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth from the land of Egypt, out of the house of bond-men, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> At the end of seven years dismiss ye every man his brother a Hebrew, who hath been sold to thee; and when he hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from thee: but your fathers hearkened not to me, neither inclined their ear. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> And ye had now turned, and had done right in my sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbor; and ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called by my name: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:16">34:16</a> But ye turned and profaned my name, and caused every man his servant, and every man his handmaid, whom he had set at liberty at their pleasure, to return, and brought them into subjection, to be to you for servants and for handmaids. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD; Ye have not hearkened to me, in proclaiming liberty, every one to his brother, and every man to his neighbor: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you, saith the LORD, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the famine; and I will make you to be removed into all the kingdoms of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> And I will give the men that have transgressed my covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant which they had made before me, when they cut the calf in two, and passed between the parts of it, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> The princes of Judah, and the princes of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, who passed between the parts of the calf; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> I will even give them into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life: and their dead bodies shall be for food to the fowls of the heaven, and to the beasts of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes I will give into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which are gone up from you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:22">34:22</a> Behold, I will command, saith the LORD, and cause them to return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take it, and burn it with fire: and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation without an inhabitant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak to them, and bring them into the house of the LORD, into one of the chambers, and give them wine to drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> Then I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of Habaziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole house of the Rechabites; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> And I brought them into the house of the LORD, into the chamber of the sons of Hanan, the son of Igdaliah, a man of God, who was by the chamber of the princes, which was above the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the door: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites pots full of wine, and cups, and I said to them, Drink ye wine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> But they said, We will drink no wine: for Jonadab the son of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no wine, neither ye, nor your sons for ever: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a> Neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant vineyard, nor have any: but all your days ye shall dwell in tents; that ye may live many days in the land where ye are strangers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> Thus have we obeyed the voice of Jonadab the son of Rechab our father in all that he hath charged us, to drink no wine all our days, we, our wives, our sons, nor our daughters; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> Nor to build houses for us to dwell in: neither have we vineyard, nor field, nor seed: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> But we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed, and done according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a> But it came to pass, when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came up into the land, that we said, Come, and let us go to Jerusalem for fear of the army of the Chaldeans, and for fear of the army of the Syrians: so we dwell at Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Go and tell the men of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will ye not receive instruction to hearken to my words? saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a> The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded his sons not to drink wine, are performed; for to this day they drink none, but obey their father's commandment: notwithstanding I have spoken to you, rising early and speaking; but ye hearkened not to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> I have sent also to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Return ye now every man from his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other gods to serve them, and ye shall dwell in the land which I have given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your ear, nor hearkened to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a> Because the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed the commandment of their father, which he commanded them; but this people hath not hearkened to me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:17">35:17</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced against them; because I have spoken to them, but they have not heard; and I have called to them, but they have not answered. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:18">35:18</a> And Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Because ye have obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his precepts, and done according to all that he hath commanded you: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:19">35:19</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Jonadab the son of Rechab shall not want a man to stand before me for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, that this word came to Jeremiah from the LORD, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> Take thee a roll of a book, and write in it all the words that I have spoken to thee against Israel, and against Judah, and against all the nations, from the day I spoke to thee, from the days of Josiah, even to this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> It may be that the house of Judah will hear all the evil which I purpose to do to them; that they may return every man from his evil way; that I may forgive their iniquity and their sin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> Then Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Neriah: and Baruch wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the LORD, which he had spoken to him, upon a roll of a book. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am confined, I cannot go into the house of the LORD: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> Therefore go thou and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my mouth, the words of the LORD in the ears of the people in the LORD'S house upon the day of fasting: and also thou shalt read them in the ears of all Judah that come out of their cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> It may be they will present their supplication before the LORD, and will return every one from his evil way: for great is the anger and the fury that the LORD hath pronounced against this people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> And Baruch the son of Neriah did according to all that Jeremiah the prophet commanded him, reading in the book the words of the LORD in the LORD'S house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of Judah, in the ninth month, that they proclaimed a fast before the LORD to all the people in Jerusalem, and to all the people that came from the cities of Judah to Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> Then Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the house of the LORD, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan the scribe, in the higher court, at the entry of the new gate of the LORD'S house, in the ears of all the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> When Michaiah the son of Gemariah, the son of Shaphan, had heard out of the book all the words of the LORD, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> Then he went down into the king's house, into the scribe's chamber: and lo, all the princes sat there, even Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan, and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> Then Michaiah declared to them all the words that he had heard, when Baruch read the book in the ears of the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:14">36:14</a> Therefore all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, to Baruch, saying, Take in thy hand the roll in which thou hast read in the ears of the people, and come. So Baruch the son of Neriah took the roll in his hand, and came to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:15">36:15</a> And they said to him, Sit down now, and read it in our ears. So Baruch read it in their ears. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:16">36:16</a> Now it came to pass when they had heard all the words, they were afraid both one and another, and said to Baruch, We will surely tell the king of all these words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou write all these words at his mouth? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:18">36:18</a> Then Baruch answered them, He pronounced all these words to me with his mouth, and I wrote them with ink in the book. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:19">36:19</a> Then said the princes to Baruch, Go, hide thyself, thou and Jeremiah; and let no man know where ye are. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:20">36:20</a> And they went in to the king into the court, but they laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe, and told all the words in the ears of the king. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:21">36:21</a> So the king sent Jehudi to bring the roll: and he took it out of the chamber of Elishama, the scribe. And Jehudi read it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes who stood beside the king. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:22">36:22</a> Now the king sat in the winter-house in the ninth month: and there was a fire on the hearth burning before him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:23">36:23</a> And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or four leaves, he cut it with the scribe's pen-knife, and cast it into the fire that was on the hearth, until all the roll was consumed in the fire that was on the hearth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:24">36:24</a> Yet they were not afraid, nor rent their garments, neither the king, nor any of his servants that heard all these words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:25">36:25</a> Nevertheless Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll: but he would not hear them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:26">36:26</a> But the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet: but the LORD hid them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:27">36:27</a> Then the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, after that the king had burned the roll, and the words which Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:28">36:28</a> Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the former words that were in the first roll, which Jehoiakim king of Judah hath burned. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:29">36:29</a> And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith the LORD; Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from thence man and beast? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:30">36:30</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah; He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David: and his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in the night to the frost. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:31">36:31</a> And I will punish him and his seed and his servants for their iniquity; and I will bring upon them, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah, all the evil that I have pronounced against them; but they hearkened not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:32">36:32</a> Then Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the scribe, the son of Neriah; who wrote therein from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of the book which Jehoiakim king of Judah had burned in the fire: and there were besides added to them many like words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:1">37:1</a> And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, whom Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon made king in the land of Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:2">37:2</a> But neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the land, hearkened to the words of the LORD, which he spoke by the prophet Jeremiah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:3">37:3</a> And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, Pray now to the LORD our God for us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:4">37:4</a> Now Jeremiah came in and went out among the people: for they had not put him into prison. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:5">37:5</a> Then Pharaoh's army had come from Egypt: and when the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them, they departed from Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:6">37:6</a> Then came the word of the LORD to the prophet Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:7">37:7</a> Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel; Thus shall ye say to the king of Judah, that sent you to me to inquire of me; Behold, Pharaoh's army, which hath come forth to help you, shall return to Egypt into their own land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:8">37:8</a> And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this city, and take it, and burn it with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:9">37:9</a> Thus saith the LORD; Deceive not yourselves, saying, The Chaldeans will surely depart from us: for they will not depart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:10">37:10</a> For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans that fight against you, and there remained but wounded men among them, yet would they rise up every man in his tent, and burn this city with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:11">37:11</a> And it came to pass, that when the army of the Chaldeans was broken up from Jerusalem for fear of Pharaoh's army, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:12">37:12</a> Then Jeremiah went out of Jerusalem to go into the land of Benjamin, to separate himself thence in the midst of the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:13">37:13</a> And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the ward was there, whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah, the son of Hananiah; and he took Jeremiah the prophet, saying, Thou fallest away to the Chaldeans. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:14">37:14</a> Then said Jeremiah, It is false; I fall not away to the Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him: so Irijah took Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:15">37:15</a> Wherefore the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and beat him, and put him in prison in the house of Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:16">37:16</a> When Jeremiah had entered into the dungeon, and into the cabins, and Jeremiah had remained there many days; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:17">37:17</a> Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took him out: and the king asked him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from the LORD? And Jeremiah said, There is: for, said he, thou shalt be delivered into the hand of the king of Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:18">37:18</a> Moreover Jeremiah said to king Zedekiah, In what have I offended against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people, that ye have put me in prison? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:19">37:19</a> Where are now your prophets who prophesied to you, saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor against this land? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:20">37:20</a> Therefore hear now, I pray thee, O my lord the king: let my supplication, I pray thee, be accepted before thee; that thou cause me not to return to the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:21">37:21</a> Then Zedekiah the king commanded that they should commit Jeremiah into the court of the prison, and that they should give him daily a piece of bread out of the baker's street, until all the bread in the city should be consumed. Thus Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:1">38:1</a> Then Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of Malchiah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken to all the people, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:2">38:2</a> Thus saith the LORD, He that remaineth in this city shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: but he that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; for he shall have his life for a prey, and shall live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:3">38:3</a> Thus saith the LORD, This city shall surely be given into the hand of the king of Babylon's army, which shall take it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:4">38:4</a> Therefore the princes said to the king, We beseech thee, let this man be put to death: for thus he weakeneth the hands of the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all the people, in speaking such words to them: for this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:5">38:5</a> Then Zedekiah the king said, Behold, he is in your hand: for the king is not he that can do any thing against you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:6">38:6</a> Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of Malchiah the son of Hammelech, that was in the court of the prison: and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the dungeon there was no water, but mire: so Jeremiah sunk in the mire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:7">38:7</a> Now when Ebed-melech the Cushite, one of the eunuchs who was in the king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon; the king then sitting in the gate of Benjamin; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> Ebed-melech went out of the king's house, and spoke to the king, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:9">38:9</a> My lord the king, these men have done evil in all that they have done to Jeremiah the prophet, whom they have cast into the dungeon; and he is like to die by hunger in the place where he is: for there is no more bread in the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:10">38:10</a> Then the king commanded Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the prophet out of the dungeon, before he dieth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:11">38:11</a> So Ebed-melech took the men with him, and went into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence old cast clouts and old decayed rags, and let them down by cords into the dungeon to Jeremiah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:12">38:12</a> And Ebed-melech the Cushite said to Jeremiah, Put now these old cast clouts and decayed rags under thy arm-holes under the cords. And Jeremiah did so. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:13">38:13</a> So they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and took him out of the dungeon: and Jeremiah remained in the court of the prison. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:14">38:14</a> Then Zedekiah the king sent, and took Jeremiah the prophet to him into the third entry that is in the house of the LORD: and the king said to Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing; hide nothing from me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:15">38:15</a> Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, If I declare it to thee, wilt thou not surely put me to death? and if I give thee counsel, wilt thou not hearken to me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:16">38:16</a> So Zedekiah the king swore secretly to Jeremiah, saying, As the LORD liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these men that seek thy life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:17">38:17</a> Then said Jeremiah to Zedekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; If thou wilt assuredly go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live, and thy house: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:18">38:18</a> But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not escape from their hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:19">38:19</a> And Zedekiah the king said to Jeremiah, I am afraid of the Jews that have fallen to the Chaldeans, lest they deliver me into their hand, and they mock me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:20">38:20</a> But Jeremiah said, They shall not deliver thee. Obey, I beseech thee, the voice of the LORD, which I speak to thee: so it shall be well to thee, and thy soul shall live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:21">38:21</a> But if thou shalt refuse to go forth, this is the word that the LORD hath shown me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:22">38:22</a> And behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes, and those women shall say, Thy friends have set thee on, and have prevailed against thee: thy feet are sunk in the mire, and they are turned away back. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:23">38:23</a> So they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to the Chaldeans: and thou shalt not escape out of their hand, but shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon: and thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:24">38:24</a> Then said Zedekiah to Jeremiah, Let no man know of these words, and thou shalt not die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:25">38:25</a> But if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and they come to thee, and say to thee, Declare to us now what thou hast said to the king, hide it not from us, and we will not put thee to death; also what the king said to thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:26">38:26</a> Then thou shalt say to them, I presented my supplication before the king, that he would not cause me to return to Jonathan's house, to die there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:27">38:27</a> Then came all the princes to Jeremiah, and asked him: and he told them according to all these words that the king had commanded. So they left off speaking with him; for the matter was not perceived. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:28">38:28</a> So Jeremiah abode in the court of the prison until the day that Jerusalem was taken: and he was there when Jerusalem was taken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:1">39:1</a> In the ninth year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against Jerusalem, and they besieged it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:2">39:2</a> And in the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, the ninth day of the month, the city was broken up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:3">39:3</a> And all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat in the middle gate, even Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsechim, Rab-saris, Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, with all the residue of the princes of the king of Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:4">39:4</a> And it came to pass, when Zedekiah the king of Judah saw them, and all the men of war, then they fled, and went out of the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate betwixt the two walls: and he went out the way of the plain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:5">39:5</a> But the Chaldeans' army pursued them, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho: and when they had taken him, they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath, where he gave judgment upon him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:6">39:6</a> Then the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah in Riblah before his eyes: also the king of Babylon slew all the nobles of Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:7">39:7</a> Moreover he put out Zedekiah's eyes, and bound him with chains, to carry him to Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:8">39:8</a> And the Chaldeans burned the king's house, and the houses of the people, with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:9">39:9</a> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive into Babylon the remnant of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to him, with the rest of the people that remained. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:10">39:10</a> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left of the poor of the people, who had nothing, in the land of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:11">39:11</a> Now Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon gave charge concerning Jeremiah to Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:12">39:12</a> Take him, and look well to him, and do him no harm; but do to him even as he shall say to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:13">39:13</a> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard sent, and Nebushasban, Rab-saris, and Nergal-sharezer, Rab-mag, and all the king of Babylon's princes; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:14">39:14</a> Even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the prison, and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, that he should carry him home: so he dwelt among the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:15">39:15</a> Now the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah, while he was confined in the court of the prison, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:16">39:16</a> Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Cushite, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will bring my words upon this city for evil, and not for good; and they shall be accomplished in that day before thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:17">39:17</a> But I will deliver thee in that day, saith the LORD: and thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou art afraid. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:18">39:18</a> For I will surely deliver thee, and thou shalt not fall by the sword, but thy life shall be for a prey to thee: because thou hast put thy trust in me, saith the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:1">40:1</a> The word which came to Jeremiah from the LORD, after that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had let him go from Ramah, when he had taken him being bound in chains among all that were carried away captive of Jerusalem and Judah, who were carried away captive to Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:2">40:2</a> And the captain of the guard took Jeremiah, and said to him, The LORD thy God hath pronounced this evil upon this place. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:3">40:3</a> Now the LORD hath brought it, and done according as he hath said: because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed his voice, therefore this thing is come upon you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:4">40:4</a> And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains which were upon thy hand. If it seemeth good to thee to come with me into Babylon, come; and I will look well to thee: but if it seemeth ill to thee to come with me into Babylon, forbear: behold, all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and convenient for thee to go, thither go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:5">40:5</a> Now while he had not yet gone back, he said, Go back also to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the cities of Judah, and dwell with him among the people: or go wherever it seemeth convenient to thee to go. So the captain of the guard gave him provisions and a reward, and let him go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:6">40:6</a> Then Jeremiah went to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and dwelt with him among the people that were left in the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:7">40:7</a> Now when all the captains of the forces who were in the fields, even they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam governor in the land, and had committed to him men, and women, and children, and of the poor of the land, of them that were not carried away captive to Babylon; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:8">40:8</a> Then they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and their men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:9">40:9</a> And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, swore to them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon, and it shall be well with you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:10">40:10</a> As for me, behold, I will dwell at Mizpah, to serve the Chaldeans, who will come to us: but ye, gather ye wine, and summer fruits, and oil, and put them in your vessels, and dwell in your cities that ye have taken. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:11">40:11</a> Likewise when all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the Ammonites, and in Edom, and that were in all the countries, heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant of Judah, and that he had set over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:12">40:12</a> Even all the Jews returned out of all places whither they were driven, and came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah, to Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in abundance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:13">40:13</a> Moreover Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:14">40:14</a> And said to him, Dost thou certainly know that Baalis the king of the Ammonites hath sent Ishmael the son of Nethaniah to slay thee? But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam believed them not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:15">40:15</a> Then Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will slay Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and no man shall know it: why should he slay thee, that all the Jews who are gathered to thee should be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:16">40:16</a> But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said to Johanan the son of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing: for thou speakest falsely of Ishmael. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:1">41:1</a> Now it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, and the princes of the king, even ten men with him, came to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to Mizpah; and there they ate bread together in Mizpah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:2">41:2</a> Then arose Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and the ten men that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan with the sword, and slew him, whom the king of Babylon had made governor over the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:3">41:3</a> Ishmael also slew all the Jews that were with him, even with Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there, and the men of war. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:4">41:4</a> And it came to pass the second day after he had slain Gedaliah, and no man knew it, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:5">41:5</a> That there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria, even eighty men, having their beards shaven, and their clothes rent, and having cut themselves, with offerings and incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:6">41:6</a> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to meet them, weeping all along as he went: and it came to pass, as he met them, he said to them, Come to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:7">41:7</a> And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city, that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah slew them, and cast them into the midst of the pit, he, and the men that were with him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:8">41:8</a> But ten men were found among them that said to Ishmael, Slay us not: for we have treasures in the field, of wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbore, and slew them not among their brethren. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:9">41:9</a> Now the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies of the men, whom he had slain because of Gedaliah, was that which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of Israel: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with them that were slain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:10">41:10</a> Then Ishmael carried away captive all the residue of the people that were in Mizpah, even the king's daughters, and all the people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam: and Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and departed to go over to the Ammonites. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:11">41:11</a> But when Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had done. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:12">41:12</a> Then they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that are in Gibeon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:13">41:13</a> Now it came to pass, that when all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, then they were glad. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:14">41:14</a> So all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive from Mizpah cast about and returned, and went to Johanan the son of Kareah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:15">41:15</a> But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with eight men, and went to the Ammonites. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:16">41:16</a> Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces that were with him, took all the remnant of the people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, from Mizpeh, after that he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, even mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:17">41:17</a> And they departed, and dwelt in the habitation of Chimham, which is by Beth-lehem, to go to enter into Egypt, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:18">41:18</a> Because of the Chaldeans: for they were afraid of them, because Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon made governor in the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:1">42:1</a> Then all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, came near. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:2">42:2</a> And said to Jeremiah the prophet, We beseech thee, let our supplication be accepted before thee, and pray for us to the LORD thy God, even for all this remnant; (for we are left but a few of many, as thy eyes do behold us:) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:3">42:3</a> That the LORD thy God may show us the way in which we may walk, and the thing that we may do. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:4">42:4</a> Then Jeremiah the prophet said to them, I have heard you; behold, I will pray to the LORD your God according to your words; and it shall come to pass, that whatever thing the LORD shall answer you, I will declare it to you; I will keep nothing back from you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:5">42:5</a> Then they said to Jeremiah, The LORD be a true and faithful witness between us, if we do not even according to all things for which the LORD thy God shall send thee to us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:6">42:6</a> Whether it be good, or whether it be evil, we will obey the voice of the LORD our God, to whom we send thee; that it may be well with us, when we obey the voice of the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:7">42:7</a> And it came to pass after ten days, that the word of the LORD came to Jeremiah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:8">42:8</a> Then called he Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces who were with him, and all the people from the least even to the greatest, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:9">42:9</a> And said to them, Thus saith the LORD, the God of Israel, to whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:10">42:10</a> If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build you, and not pull you down, and I will plant you, and not pluck you up: for I repent of the evil that I have done to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:11">42:11</a> Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are afraid; be not afraid of him, saith the LORD; for I am with you, to save you, and to deliver you from his hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:12">42:12</a> And I will show mercies to you, that he may have mercy upon you, and cause you to return to your own land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:13">42:13</a> But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land, neither obey the voice of the LORD your God, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:14">42:14</a> Saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor hunger for bread; and there will we dwell: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:15">42:15</a> And now therefore hear the word of the LORD, ye remnant of Judah; Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; If ye wholly set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go to sojourn there; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:16">42:16</a> Then it shall come to pass, that the sword, which ye feared, shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine of which ye were afraid, shall follow close after you there in Egypt; and there ye shall die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:17">42:17</a> So shall it be with all the men that set their faces to go into Egypt to sojourn there; they shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: and none of them shall remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:18">42:18</a> For thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; As my anger and my fury hath been poured forth upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem: so shall my fury be poured forth upon you, when ye shall enter into Egypt: and ye shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach; and ye shall see this place no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:19">42:19</a> The LORD hath said concerning you, O ye remnant of Judah; Go ye not into Egypt: know certainly that I have admonished you this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:20">42:20</a> For ye dissembled in your hearts, when ye sent me to the LORD your God, saying, Pray for us to the LORD our God; and according to all that the LORD our God shall say, so declare to us, and we will do it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:21">42:21</a> And now I have this day declared it to you; but ye have not obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, nor any thing for which he hath sent me to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:22">42:22</a> Now therefore know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye desire to go and to sojourn. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:1">43:1</a> And it came to pass, that when Jeremiah had made an end of speaking to all the people all the words of the LORD their God, for which the LORD their God had sent him to them, even all these words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:2">43:2</a> Then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, Thou speakest falsely: the LORD our God hath not sent thee to say, Go not into Egypt to sojourn there: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:3">43:3</a> But Baruch the son of Neriah setteth thee on against us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:4">43:4</a> So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, and all the people, obeyed not the voice of the LORD, to dwell in the land of Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:5">43:5</a> But Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that had returned from all nations, whither they had been driven, to dwell in the land of Judah; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:6">43:6</a> Even men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Neriah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:7">43:7</a> So they came into the land of Egypt: for they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: thus they came even to Tahpanhes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:8">43:8</a> Then came the word of the LORD to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:9">43:9</a> Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in the clay in the brick-kiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes, in the sight of the men of Judah; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:10">43:10</a> And say to them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones that I have hid; and he shall spread his royal pavilion over them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:11">43:11</a> And when he cometh, he shall smite the land of Egypt, and deliver such as are for death to death; and such as are for captivity to captivity; and such as are for the sword to the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:12">43:12</a> And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of Egypt; and he shall burn them, and carry them away captives: and he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:13">43:13</a> He shall break also the images of Beth-shemesh, that is in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of the Egyptians shall he burn with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:1">44:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who dwell in the land of Egypt, who dwell at Migdol, and at Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:2">44:2</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Ye have seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon all the cities of Judah; and behold, this day they are a desolation, and no man dwelleth in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:3">44:3</a> Because of their wickedness which they have committed to provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense, and to serve other gods, whom they knew not, neither they, ye, nor your fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:4">44:4</a> Yet I sent to you all my servants the prophets, rising early and sending them, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing that I hate. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:5">44:5</a> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from their wickedness, to burn no incense to other gods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:6">44:6</a> Wherefore my fury and my anger was poured forth, and was kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem; and they are wasted and desolate, as at this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:7">44:7</a> Therefore now thus saith the LORD, the God of hosts, the God of Israel; Why do ye commit this great evil against your souls, to cut off from you man and woman, child and suckling, out of Judah, to leave you none to remain; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:8">44:8</a> In that ye provoke me to wrath with the works of your hands, burning incense to other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are gone to dwell, that ye may cut yourselves off, and that ye may be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:9">44:9</a> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:10">44:10</a> They are not humbled even to this day, neither have they feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes, that I set before you and before your fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:11">44:11</a> Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off all Judah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:12">44:12</a> And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their faces to go into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and they shall all be consumed, and fall in the land of Egypt; they shall even be consumed by the sword and by the famine: they shall die, from the least even to the greatest, by the sword and by the famine: and they shall be an execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:13">44:13</a> For I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt, as I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:14">44:14</a> So that none of the remnant of Judah, who have gone into the land of Egypt, to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, that they should return into the land of Judah, to which they have a desire to return to dwell there: for none shall return but such as shall escape. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:15">44:15</a> Then all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to other gods, and all the women that stood by, a great multitude, even all the people that dwelt in the land of Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:16">44:16</a> As for the word that thou hast spoken to us in the name of the LORD, we will not hearken to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:17">44:17</a> But we will certainly do whatever thing proceedeth from our own mouth, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we, and our fathers, our kings, and our princes, in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem: for then we had plenty of provisions, and were well, and saw no evil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:18">44:18</a> But since we ceased to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her, we have wanted all things, and have been consumed by the sword and by the famine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:19">44:19</a> And when we burned incense to the queen of heaven, and poured out drink-offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to worship her, and pour out drink-offerings to her, without our men? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:20">44:20</a> Then Jeremiah said to all the people, to the men, and to the women, and to all the people who had given him that answer, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:21">44:21</a> The incense that ye burned in the cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers, your kings and your princes, and the people of the land, did not the LORD remember them, and came it not into his mind? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:22">44:22</a> So that the LORD could no longer bear, because of the evil of your doings, and because of the abominations which ye have committed; therefore is your land a desolation, and an astonishment, and a curse, without an inhabitant, as at this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:23">44:23</a> Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned against the LORD, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his testimonies; therefore this evil hath happened to you, as at this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:24">44:24</a> Moreover, Jeremiah said to all the people, and to all the women, Hear the word of the LORD, all Judah that are in the land of Egypt: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:25">44:25</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, saying; Ye and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled with your hand, saying, We will surely perform our vows that we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings to her: ye will surely accomplish your vows, and surely perform your vows. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:26">44:26</a> Therefore hear ye the word of the LORD, all Judah that dwell in the land of Egypt; Behold, I have sworn by my great name, saith the LORD, that my name shall no more be named in the mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying, The Lord GOD liveth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:27">44:27</a> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good: and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there shall be an end of them. </p>

 <p><a name="an_51:27">51:27</a> Set ye up a standard in the land, blow the trumpet among the nations, prepare the nations against her, call together against her the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashchenaz; appoint a captain against her; cause the horses to come up as the rough caterpillars. </p>

 <p><a name="an_51:54">51:54</a> A sound of a cry cometh from Babylon, and great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:55">51:55</a> Because the LORD hath laid waste Babylon, and destroyed out of her the great voice; when her waves roar like great waters, a noise of their voice is uttered: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:56">51:56</a> Because the spoiler is come upon her, even upon Babylon, and her mighty men are taken, every one of their bows is broken: for the LORD God of recompenses shall surely requite. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:57">51:57</a> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her captains, and her rulers, and her mighty men: and they shall sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the king, whose name is the LORD of hosts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:58">51:58</a> Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The broad walls of Babylon shall be utterly broken, and her high gates shall be burned with fire; and the people shall labor in vain, and the people in the fire, and they shall be weary. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:59">51:59</a> The word which Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the son of Neriah, the son of Maaseiah, when he went with Zedekiah the king of Judah into Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. And this Seraiah was a quiet prince. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:60">51:60</a> So Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come upon Babylon, even all these words that are written against Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:61">51:61</a> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou shalt come to Babylon, and shalt see, and shalt read all these words; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:62">51:62</a> Then shalt thou say, O LORD, thou hast spoken against this place, to cut it off, that none shall remain in it, neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:63">51:63</a> And it shall be, when thou hast made an end of reading this book, that thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the midst of Euphrates: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:64">51:64</a> And thou shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not rise from the evil that I will bring upon her: and they shall be weary. Thus far are the words of Jeremiah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:1">52:1</a> Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:2">52:2</a> And he did that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD, according to all that Jehoiakim had done. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:3">52:3</a> For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem and Judah, till he had cast them out from his presence, that Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:4">52:4</a> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem, and encamped against it, and built forts against it on every side. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:5">52:5</a> So the city was besieged to the eleventh year of king Zedekiah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:6">52:6</a> And in the fourth month, in the ninth day of the month, the famine was severe in the city, so that there was no bread for the people of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:7">52:7</a> Then the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled, and went forth from the city by night by the way of the gate between the two walls, which was by the king's garden; (now the Chaldeans were by the city on all sides:) and they went by the way of the plain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:8">52:8</a> But the army of the Chaldeans pursued the king, and overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army was scattered from him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:9">52:9</a> Then they took the king, and carried him to the king of Babylon to Riblah in the land of Hamath; where he gave judgment upon him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:10">52:10</a> And the king of Babylon slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes: he slew also all the princes of Judah in Riblah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:11">52:11</a> Then he put out the eyes of Zedekiah; and the king of Babylon bound him in chains, and carried him to Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:12">52:12</a> Now in the fifth month, in the tenth day of the month, which was the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, came Nebuzar-adan, captain of the guard, who served the king of Babylon, into Jerusalem, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:13">52:13</a> And burned the house of the LORD, and the king's house; and all the houses of Jerusalem, and all the houses of the great men he burned with fire: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:14">52:14</a> And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the captain of the guard, broke down all the walls of Jerusalem on every side. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:15">52:15</a> Then Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive certain of the poor of the people, and the residue of the people that remained in the city, and those that fell away, that fell to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:16">52:16</a> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard left certain of the poor of the land for vine-dressers and for husbandmen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:17">52:17</a> Also the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD, and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of the LORD, the Chaldeans broke, and carried all the brass of them to Babylon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:18">52:18</a> The caldrons also, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the bowls, and the spoons, and all the vessels of brass with which they ministered, they took away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:19">52:19</a> And the basins, and the fire-pans, and the bowls, and the caldrons, and the candlesticks, and the spoons, and the cups; that which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in silver, the captain of the guard took away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:20">52:20</a> The two pillars, one sea, and twelve brazen bulls that were under the bases, which king Solomon had made in the house of the LORD: the brass of all these vessels was without weight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:21">52:21</a> And concerning the pillars, the hight of one pillar was eighteen cubits; and a fillet of twelve cubits encompassed it; and the thickness of it was four fingers: it was hollow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:22">52:22</a> And a capital of brass was upon it; and the hight of one capital was five cubits, with net-work and pomegranates upon the capitals around, all of brass. The second pillar also and the pomegranates were like to these. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:23">52:23</a> And there were ninety and six pomegranates on a side; and all the pomegranates upon the net-work were a hundred on all sides. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:24">52:24</a> And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the door: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:25">52:25</a> He took also out of the city a eunuch, who had the charge of the men of war; and seven men of them that were near the king's person, who were found in the city; and the principal scribe of the host, who mustered the people of the land; and sixty men of the people of the land, that were found in the midst of the city. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:26">52:26</a> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard took them, and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:27">52:27</a> And the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death in Riblah, in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away captive out of his own land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:28">52:28</a> This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away captive: in the seventh year three thousand Jews and three and twenty: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:29">52:29</a> In the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar he carried away captive from Jerusalem eight hundred thirty and two persons: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:30">52:30</a> In the three and twentieth year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan the captain of the guard carried away captive of the Jews seven hundred forty and five persons: all the persons were four thousand and six hundred. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:31">52:31</a> And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, in the five and twentieth day of the month, that Evil-merodach king of Babylon in the first year of his reign lifted up the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him out of prison, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:32">52:32</a> And spoke kindly to him, and set his throne above the throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:33">52:33</a> And changed his prison garments: and he continually ate bread before him all the days of his life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:34">52:34</a> And for his food there was a continual diet given him of the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his death, all the days of his life. </p>
