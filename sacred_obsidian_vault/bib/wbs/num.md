 <p><a name="an_10:33">10:33</a> And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days' journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before them in the three days' journey, to seek a resting-place for them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:34">10:34</a> And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went out of the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:35">10:35</a> And it came to pass, when the ark moved forward, that Moses said, Arise, LORD, and let thy enemies be scattered; and let them that hate thee flee before thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:36">10:36</a> And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, to the many thousands of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD; and the LORD heard it: and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> And the people cried to Moses; and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire was quenched. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And he called the name of the place Taberah; because the fire of the LORD burnt among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And the mixed multitude that was among them fell to lusting: and the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh to eat? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> We remember the fish which we ate in Egypt freely: the cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the garlic: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> But now our soul is dried away; there is nothing at all, besides this manna, before our eyes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> And the manna was as coriander-seed, and the color of it as the color of bdellium. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And the people went about, and gathered it and ground it in mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell upon it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> Then Moses heard the people weeping throughout their families, every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD was kindled greatly: Moses also was displeased. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And Moses said to the LORD, Why hast thou afflicted thy servant? and why have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou shouldest say to me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a nursing-father beareth the sucking child, to the land which thou sworest to their fathers? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? for they weep to me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too heavy for me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And if thou dealest thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand, if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Gather to me seventy men of the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and officers over them; and bring them to the tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou mayest not bear it thyself alone. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And say thou to the people, Sanctify yourselves against to-morrow, and ye shall eat flesh; for ye have wept in the ears of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you flesh, and ye shall eat. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten days, nor twenty days; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> But even a whole month, until it shall come out at your nostrils, and it be lothsome to you; because ye have despised the LORD who is among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of Egypt? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> And Moses said, The people among whom I am, are six hundred thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they may eat a whole month. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice for them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered for them, to suffice for them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Is the LORD'S hand shortened? thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass to thee, or not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD, and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them around the tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spoke to him, and took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it to the seventy elders: and it came to pass, that when the spirit rested upon them; they prophesied, and did not cease. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested upon them, and they were of them that were described, but went not out to the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and Medad do prophesy in the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young men, answered and said, My lord, Moses, forbid them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> And Moses said to him, Enviest thou for my sake? I would that all the LORD'S people were prophets, and that the LORD would put his spirit upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> And Moses withdrew into the camp, he and the elders of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:31">11:31</a> And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, around the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:32">11:32</a> And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all abroad for themselves around the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:33">11:33</a> And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:34">11:34</a> And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah: because there they buried the people that lusted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:35">11:35</a> And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah to Hazeroth: and abode at Hazeroth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married: for he had married a Cushite woman. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoke only by Moses? hath he not spoke also by us? And the LORD heard it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men who were upon the face of the earth.) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And the LORD spoke suddenly to Moses, and to Aaron, and to Miriam, Come out ye three to the tabernacle of the congregation. And they three came out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came forth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And he said, Hear now my words: If there is a prophet among you, I the LORD will make myself known to him in a vision, and will speak to him in a dream. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all my house. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he behold: why then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he departed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and behold, Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and behold, she was leprous. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> And Aaron said to Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay not the sin upon us, in which we have done foolishly, and in which we have sinned. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed at the time of his birth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I beseech thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> And the LORD said to Moses, If her father had but spit in her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be received again. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and encamped in the wilderness of Paran. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give to the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And Moses, by the commandment of the LORD, sent them from the wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manassah, Gaddi the son of Susi. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to explore the land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And Moses sent them to explore the land of Canaan, and said to them, Go ye up this way southward, and ascend the mountain: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwell therein, whether they are strong or weak, few or many; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it is good or bad; and what cities they are that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in strong holds; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> And what the land is, whether it is fertile or barren, whether there is wood in it, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of Zin to Rehob, as men come to Hamath. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And they ascended by the south, and came to Hebron; where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> And they came to the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bore it between two upon a staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> And they returned from exploring the land after forty days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the congregation of the children of Israel, to the wilderness of Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word to them, and to all the congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> And they told him, and said, We came to the land whither thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the fruit of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> Nevertheless, the people are strong that dwell in the land, and the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover, we saw the children of Anak there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> But the men that went up with him said, We are not able to go up against the people; for they are stronger than we. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:32">13:32</a> And they brought an evil report of the land which they had searched to the children of Israel, saying, The land through which we have passed to search it, is a land that eateth up its inhabitants; and all the people that we saw in it, are men of a great stature. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, who come of the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in their sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron: and the whole congregation said to them, O that we had died in the land of Egypt! or O that we had died in this wilderness! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> And why hath the LORD brought us to this land, to fall by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us return into Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And they spoke to all the company of the children of Israel, saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding good land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> If the LORD delighteth in us, then he will bring us into this land, and give it to us; a land which floweth with milk and honey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people of the land; for they are bread for us: their defense has departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> But all the congregation required to stone them with stones: and the glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And the LORD said to Moses, How long will this people provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shown among them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And Moses said to the LORD, Then the Egyptians will hear it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth over them, and that thou goest before them, by day-time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the land which he swore to them, therefore he hath slain them in the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great, according as thou hast spoken, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> The LORD is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according to the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from Egypt, even until now. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the glory of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> Because all those men who have seen my glory, and my miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> Surely they shall not see the land which I swore to their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land into which he went; and his seed shall possess it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> (Now the Amalekites, and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.) To-morrow turn you, and pass into the wilderness, by the way of the Red sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel, which they murmur against me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> Say to them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have spoken in my ears, so will I do to you: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:29">14:29</a> Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against me, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:30">14:30</a> Doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swore to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:31">14:31</a> But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:32">14:32</a> But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:33">14:33</a> And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and bear your lewd deeds, until your carcasses shall be wasted in the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:34">14:34</a> After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even forty days (each day for a year) shall ye bear your iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of promise. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:35">14:35</a> I the LORD have said, I will surely do it to all this evil congregation, that are gathered against me: in this wilderness, they shall be consumed, and there they shall die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:36">14:36</a> And the men whom Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing a slander upon the land, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:37">14:37</a> Even those men that brought the evil report upon the land, died by the plague before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:38">14:38</a> But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were of the men that went to search the land, lived still. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:39">14:39</a> And Moses told these sayings to all the children of Israel: and the people mourned greatly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:40">14:40</a> And they rose early in the morning, and ascended to the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we are here, and will go up to the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have sinned. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:41">14:41</a> And Moses said, Why now do ye transgress the commandment of the LORD? but it shall not prosper. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:42">14:42</a> Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not smitten before your enemies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:43">14:43</a> For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:44">14:44</a> But they presumed to go up to the hill-top: nevertheless the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out of the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:45">14:45</a> Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even to Hormah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p>

 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> And will make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt-offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a free-will-offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savor to the LORD, of the herd, or of the flock: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> Then shall he that offereth his offering to the LORD bring a meat-offering of a tenth part of flour mingled with the fourth part of a hin of oil. </p>

 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> And the priest shall make an atonement for all the congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their offering, a sacrifice made by fire to the LORD, and their sin-offering before the LORD, for their ignorance: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing all the people were in ignorance. </p>

 <p><a name="an_15:34">15:34</a> And they put him in custody, because it was not declared what should be done to him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:35">15:35</a> And the LORD said to Moses, The man shall surely be put to death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp. </p>

 <p><a name="an_15:37">15:37</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p>

 <p><a name="an_15:39">15:39</a> And it shall be to you for a fringe, that ye may look upon it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own eyes, after which ye use to go astray: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:40">15:40</a> That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy to your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:41">15:41</a> I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the congregation, men of renown: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> And they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron, and said to them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them: why then do ye raise yourselves above the congregation of the LORD? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And he spoke to Korah and to all his company, saying, Even to-morrow the LORD will show who are his, and who is holy; and will cause him to come near to him: even him whom he hath chosen will he cause to come near to him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> And put fire in them, and put incense in them before the LORD to-morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> And Moses said to Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> Seemeth it but a small thing to you, that the God of Israel hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> For which cause both thou and all thy company are assembled against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against him? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab: who said, We will not come up: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us out of a land that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over us? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> And Moses was very wroth, and said to the LORD, Respect not thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt one of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> And Moses said to Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to-morrow: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers; thou also and Aaron each of you his censer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid incense on them, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the congregation with Moses and Aaron. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And Korah gathered all the congregation against them to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the LORD appeared to all the congregation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with all the congregation? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> Speak to the congregation, saying, Withdraw yourselves from about the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> And Moses rose up, and went to Dathan and Abiram; and the elders of Israel followed him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> And he spoke to the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest ye be consumed in all their sins. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> So they withdrew from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> And Moses said, by this ye shall know that the LORD hath sent me to do all these works: for I have not done them of my own mind. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> If these men shall die the common death of all men, or if they be visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath not sent me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> But if the LORD shall make a new thing, and the earth shall open her mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain to them, and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have provoked the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these words, that the ground cleaved asunder that was under them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their houses, and all the men that appertained to Korah, and all their goods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> They, and all that appertained to them went down alive into the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the congregation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> And all Israel that were round about them, fled at the cry of them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two hundred and fifty men that offered incense. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:37">16:37</a> Speak to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they are hallowed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:38">16:38</a> The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign to the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:39">16:39</a> And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, with which they that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates for a covering of the altar: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:40">16:40</a> To be a memorial to the children of Israel, that no stranger, who is not of the seed of Aaron, should come near to offer incense before the LORD; that he may not be as Korah, and as his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:41">16:41</a> But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the people of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:42">16:42</a> And it came to pass when the congregation was gathered against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked towards the tabernacle of the congregation: and behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the LORD appeared. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:43">16:43</a> And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:44">16:44</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:45">16:45</a> Remove from among this congregation, that I may consume them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:46">16:46</a> And Moses said to Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire in it from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly to the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:47">16:47</a> And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the congregation; and behold, the plague was begun among the people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:48">16:48</a> And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was stayed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:49">16:49</a> Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:50">16:50</a> And Aaron returned to Moses at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the plague was stayed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> Speak to the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all their princes according to the house of their fathers, twelve rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And thou shalt lay them in the tabernacle of the congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the children of Israel, by which they murmur against you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> And Moses spoke to the children of Israel, and every one of their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And Moses laid the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle of witness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the tabernacle of witness; and behold, the rod of Aaron for the house of Levi had budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and yielded almonds. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD to all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again, before the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> And the children of Israel spoke to Moses, saying, Behold, we die, we perish, we all perish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> Whoever approacheth the tabernacle of the LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And the LORD said to Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the iniquity of your priesthood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined to thee, and minister to thee: but thou and thy sons with thee shall minister before the tabernacle of witness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die. </p>

 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the congregation. </p>

 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> And the LORD spoke to Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee the charge of my heave-offerings of all the hallowed things of the children of Israel; to thee have I given them by reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> This shall be thine of the most holy things reserved from the fire: every oblation of theirs, every meat-offering of theirs, and every sin-offering of theirs, and every trespass-offering of theirs, which they shall render to me, shall be most holy for thee and for thy sons. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat it: it shall be holy to thee. </p>

 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the first-fruits of them which they shall offer to the LORD, them have I given to thee. </p>

 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath commanded, saying, Speak to the children of Israel, that they bring thee a red heifer without spot, in which is no blemish, and upon which never came a yoke: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And ye shall give her to Eleazar the priest, that he may bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her before his face: </p>

 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And a man that is clean shall gather the ashes of the heifer, and lay them without the camp in a clean place, and it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of Israel, for a water of separation: it is a purification for sin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening: and it shall be to the children of Israel, and to the stranger that sojourneth among them, for a statute for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days. </p>

 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> Whoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is yet upon him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean seven days. </p>

 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into the desert of Zin in the first month; and the people abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And there was no water for the congregation: and they assembled themselves against Moses and against Aaron. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And the people chid with Moses, and spoke, saying, O that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And why have ye brought the congregation of the LORD into this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> And why have ye conducted us from Egypt, to bring us to this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any water to drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> Take the rod, and convene thou the assembly, thou, and Aaron thy brother, and speak ye to the rock before their eyes; and it shall give forth its water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give drink to the congregation and their beasts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> And Moses and Aaron assembled the congregation before the rock, and he said to them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you water out of this rock? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And Moses lifted his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank, and their beasts also. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom, Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail that hath befallen us: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians afflicted us, and our fathers: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> And when we cried to the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent an angel, and hath brought us forth from Egypt: and behold, we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high-way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy borders. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> And Edom said to him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out against thee with the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> And the children of Israel said to him, We will go by the highway: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay for it: I will only, without doing any thing else, go through on my feet. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against him with many people, and with a strong hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border: wherefore Israel turned away from him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed from Kadesh, and came to mount Hor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast of the land of Edom, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> Aaron shall be gathered to his people: for he shall not enter into the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up to mount Hor: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son: and Aaron shall be gathered to his people, and shall die there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they ascended mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there on the top of the mount: and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And when king Arad the Canaanite, who dwelt in the south, heard that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And Israel vowed a vow to the LORD, and said, If thou wilt indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much discouraged because of the way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And the people spoke against God, and against Moses, Why have ye brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our soul lotheth this light bread. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the people; and many people of Israel died. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray to the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the serpent of brass, he lived. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in Oboth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the wilderness which is before Moab, towards the sun-rising. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well of which the LORD spoke to Moses, Assemble the people, and I will give them water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> Then Israel sung this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye to it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staffs. And from the wilderness they went to Mattanah: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to the top of Pisgah, which looketh towards Jeshimon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> And Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well: but we will go along by the king's high-way, until we have past thy borders. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border: but Sihon collected all his people, and went out against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his land from Arnon to Jabbok, even to the children of Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all its villages. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of his hand, even to Arnon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let the city of Sihon be built and prepared. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> For there has a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of Arnon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity to Sihon king of the Amorites. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> We have shot at them; Heshbon has perished even to Dibon, and we have laid them waste even to Nophah, which reacheth to Medeba. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:31">21:31</a> Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:32">21:32</a> And Moses sent to explore Jaazer, and they took its villages, and drove out the Amorites that were there. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:33">21:33</a> And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle at Edrei. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:34">21:34</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do to him as thou didst to Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:35">21:35</a> So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until there was none left to him alive: and they possessed his land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> And the children of Israel moved forward, and pitched in the plains of Moab on this side of Jordan by Jericho. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> And Moab was greatly afraid of the people, because they were many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> And Moab said to the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick up all that are around us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that time. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> He sent messengers therefore to Balaam the son of Beor to Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there has a people come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> Come now therefore, I pray thee, Curse for me this people; for they are too mighty for me: it may be I shall prevail, that we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I know that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came to Balaam, and spoke to him the words of Balak. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And he said to them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you word again, as the LORD shall speak to me: and the princes of Moab abode with Balaam. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And God came to Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And Balaam said to God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, hath sent to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> Behold, there has a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the face of the earth: come now, curse them for me: it may be I shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And God said to Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> And Balaam rose in the morning, and said to the princes of Balak, Depart into your land: for the LORD refuseth to give me leave to go with you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went to Balak, and said, Balaam refuseth to come with us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than they. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming to me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> For I will promote thee to very great honor, and I will do whatever thou sayest to me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse this people for me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> And Balaam answered and said to the servants of Balak, If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I may know what the LORD will say to me more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> And God came to Balaam at night, and said to him, If the men come to call thee, rise and go with them; but yet the word which I shall say to thee, that shalt thou perform. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> And Balaam rose in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went with the princes of Moab. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall being on this side, and a wall on that side. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself against the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and he smote her again. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the left. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a staff. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said to Balaam, What have I done to thee, that thou hast smitten me these three times? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> And Balaam said to the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would there were a sword in my hand, for now would I kill thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> And the ass said to Balaam, Am not I thy ass, upon which thou hast rid ever since I was thine to this day? was I ever wont to do so to thee? And he said, Nay. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:31">22:31</a> Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:32">22:32</a> And the angel of the LORD said to him, Why hast thou smitten thy ass these three times? behold, I went out to withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:33">22:33</a> And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her alive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:34">22:34</a> And Balaam said to the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it displeaseth thee, I will return again. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:35">22:35</a> And the angel of the LORD said to Balaam, Go with the men: but only the word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt speak: So Balaam went with the princes of Balak. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:36">22:36</a> And when Balak heard that Balaam had come, he went out to meet him to a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the utmost limit. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:37">22:37</a> And Balak said to Balaam, Did I not earnestly send to thee to call thee? why camest thou not to me? am I not able indeed to promote thee to honor? </p>

 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come, curse Jacob for me, and come, defy Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy, whom the LORD hath not defied? </p>

 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his face toward the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his tents according to their tribes, and the spirit of God came upon him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> He hath said, who heard the words of God, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: </p>

 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee to great honor; but lo, the LORD hath kept thee back from honor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> And Balaam said to Balak, Did I not speak also to thy messengers whom thou sentest to me, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own mind; but what the LORD saith, that will I speak? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> And now, behold, I go to my people: come therefore, I will advertise thee what this people will do to thy people in the latter days. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> He hath said, who heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge of the Most High, who saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Scepter shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the children of Sheth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly. </p>

 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said, Amalek was the first of the nations, but his latter end shall be that he shall perish for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said, Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> Nevertheless, the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asher shall carry thee away captive. </p>

 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict Ashur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> And Balaam arose, and went and returned to his place: and Balak also went his way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit lewdness with the daughters of Moab. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> And they called the people to the sacrifices of their gods: and the people ate, and bowed down to their gods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> And Israel joined himself to Baal-peor: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> And Moses said to the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men that were joined to Baal-peor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought to his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses, and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw it, he rose from among the congregation, and took a javelin in his hand; </p>

 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> For they distress you with their wiles, with which they have beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian their sister, who was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying, </p>

 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> And levy a tribute to the LORD of the men of war who went out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> Take it of their half, and give it to Eleazar the priest, for a heave-offering of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them to the Levites, who keep the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:31">31:31</a> And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:32">31:32</a> And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had taken, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and five thousand sheep, </p>

 <p><a name="an_31:36">31:36</a> And the half which was the portion of them that went out to war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty thousand and five hundred sheep: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:37">31:37</a> And the LORD'S tribute of the sheep was six hundred and seventy five. </p>

 <p><a name="an_31:48">31:48</a> And the officers who were over thousands of the hosts, the captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near to Moses: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:49">31:49</a> And they said to Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the men of war who are under our charge, and there lacketh not one man of us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:50">31:50</a> We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every man hath obtained of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings, ear-rings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:51">31:51</a> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all wrought jewels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:52">31:52</a> And all the gold of the offering that they offered to the LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:53">31:53</a> (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:54">31:54</a> And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of thousands, and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that behold, the place was a place for cattle; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and to the princes of the congregation, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this land be given to thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over Jordan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> And Moses said to the children of Gad and to the children of Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> And why discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> For when they went up to the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> And the LORD'S anger was kindled the same time, and he swore, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> Surely none of the men that came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; because they have not wholly followed me: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> And the LORD'S anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had done evil in the sight of the LORD was consumed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> And behold, ye have risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the LORD towards Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in the wilderness; and he will destroy all this people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> And they came near to him, and said, We will build sheep-folds here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel, until we have brought them to their place: and our little ones shall dwell in the fortified cities, because of the inhabitants of the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> We will not return to our houses, until the children of Israel have inherited every man his inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> For we will not inherit with them on the other side of Jordan, or forward; because our inheritance hath fallen to us on this side of Jordan eastward. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And Moses said to them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go armed before the LORD to war, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD, until he hath driven out his enemies from before him, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> And the land shall be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spoke to Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall be there in the cities of Gilead: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to battle, as my lord saith. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> And Moses said to them, If the children of Gad and the children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed for battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered, saying, As the LORD hath said to thy servants, so will we do. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> And Moses gave to them, even to the children of Gad, and to the children of Reuben, and to half the tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with its cities in the borders, even the cities of the country around. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:36">32:36</a> And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified cities: and folds for sheep. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:37">32:37</a> And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and Kirjathaim, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:38">32:38</a> And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah: and gave other names to the cities which they built. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:39">32:39</a> And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite who was in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:40">32:40</a> And Moses gave Gilead to Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt in it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:41">32:41</a> And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its small towns, and called them Havoth-jair. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:42">32:42</a> And Nobah went and took Kenath, and its villages, and called it Nobah, after his own name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> These are the journeys of the children of Israel, who went forth from the land of Egypt with their armies under the hand of Moses and Aaron. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys according to their goings out. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children of Israel went out with a high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> For the Egyptians buried all their first-born, whom the LORD had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed judgments. </p>

 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD commanded to give to the nine tribes, and to the half tribe: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> For the tribe of the children of Reuben, according to the house of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad according to the house of their fathers, have received their inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> The two tribes and the half tribe have received their inheritance on this side of Jordan near Jericho eastward, towards the sun-rising. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:16">34:16</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> And the names of the men are these: of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of Ammihud. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon. </p>

 <p><a name="an_34:24">34:24</a> And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:25">34:25</a> And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan the son of Parnach. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:26">34:26</a> And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar, Paltiel the son of Azzan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:27">34:27</a> And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the son of Shelomi. </p>

 <p><a name="an_34:29">34:29</a> These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the inheritance to the children of Israel in the land of Canaan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> Command the children of Israel, that they give to the Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell in; and ye shall give also to the Levites suburbs for the cities around them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> And they shall have the cities to dwell in; and the suburbs of them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for all their beasts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> And the suburbs of the cities which ye shall give to the Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits on all sides. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> And among the cities which ye shall give to the Levites there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint for the man-slayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye shall add forty and two cities. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a> So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few: every one shall give of his cities to the Levites according to his inheritance which he inheriteth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, When ye have passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a> Then ye shall appoint for you cities to be cities of refuge for you; that the slayer may flee thither, who killeth any person at unawares. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> And they shall be to you cities for refuge from the avenger; that the man-slayer may not die, until he stands before the congregation in judgment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> And of these cities which ye shall give, six cities shall ye have for refuge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a> Ye shall give three cities on this side of Jordan, and three cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be cities of refuge. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee thither. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a> And if he shall smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:17">35:17</a> And if he shall smite him by throwing a stone, by which he may die, and he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:18">35:18</a> Or if he shall smite him with a hand-weapon of wood, with which he may die, and he shall die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:19">35:19</a> The avenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he meeteth him, he shall slay him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:20">35:20</a> But if he shall thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying in wait, that he die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:21">35:21</a> Or in enmity shall smite him with his hand, that he die: he that smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer: the avenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:22">35:22</a> But if he shall thrust him suddenly without enmity, or shall have cast upon him any thing without laying in wait, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:23">35:23</a> Or with any stone, by which a man may die, seeing him not, and shall cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy, neither sought his harm: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:24">35:24</a> Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the avenger of blood according to these judgments: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:25">35:25</a> And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand of the avenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore him to the city of his refuge, whither he had fled: and he shall abide in it to the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the holy oil. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:26">35:26</a> But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of the city of his refuge, whither he had fled; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:27">35:27</a> And the avenger of blood find him without the borders of the city of his refuge, and the avenger of blood shall kill the slayer; he shall not be guilty of blood: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:28">35:28</a> Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his possession. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:29">35:29</a> So these things shall be for a statute of judgment to you throughout your generations in all your dwellings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:30">35:30</a> Whoever killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify against any person to cause him to die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:31">35:31</a> Moreover, ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a murderer, who is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put to death. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:32">35:32</a> And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that hath fled to the city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the land, until the death of the priest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:33">35:33</a> So ye shall not pollute the land in which ye are: for blood it defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the blood that is shed in it, but by the blood of him that shed it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:34">35:34</a> Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, in which I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spoke before Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the children of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> And if they shall be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the children of Israel, then will their inheritance be taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and will be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received: so it will be taken from the lot of our inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then will their inheritance be put to the inheritance of the tribe into which they are received: so shall their inheritance be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife to one of the family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep himself to his own inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of Zelophehad: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to their father's brothers' sons: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to the children of Israel in the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho. </p>
