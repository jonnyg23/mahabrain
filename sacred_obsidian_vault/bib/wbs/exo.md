  <h3 align="center">Webster's Bible: Exodus</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Now these are the names of the children of Israel, who came into Egypt; every man and his household came with Jacob. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Dan, and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And all the souls that descended from Jacob, were seventy souls: for Joseph was in Egypt already. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that generation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And the children of Israel were fruitful, and increased abundantly, and multiplied, and became exceeding mighty; and the land was filled with them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Now there arose a new king over Egypt, who knew not Joseph. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the children of Israel are more and mightier than we. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Come, let us deal wisely with them: lest they multiply, and it shall come to pass, that when there falleth out any war, they will join with our enemies, and fight against us, and depart from the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Therefore they set over them task-masters, to afflict them with their burdens. And they built for Pharaoh treasure-cities, Pithom, and Raamses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied and grew. And they were grieved because of the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel to serve with rigor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And they made their lives bitter with hard bondage, in mortar, and in brick, and in all manner of service in the field: all their service in which they made them serve, was with rigor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives (of which the name of one was Shiphrah, and the name of the other Puah:) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> And he said, When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew women, and see them upon the stools; if it shall be a son, then ye shall kill him; but if it shall be a daughter, then she shall live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt commanded them, but saved the male-children alive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said to them, Why have ye done this thing, and have saved the male-children alive? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are not as the Egyptian women: for they are lively, and are delivered ere the midwives come in to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people multiplied, and became very mighty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made them houses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And there went a man of the house of Levi, and married a daughter of Levi. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And the woman conceived, and bore a son: and when she saw him that he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an ark of bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river's brink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And his sister stood afar off, to know what would be done to him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river, and her maidens walked along by the river's side: and when she saw the ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and behold, the babe wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the Hebrews' children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Then said his sister to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go, and call to thee a nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called the child's mother. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and nurse it for me, and I will give thee thy wages. And the woman took the child and nursed it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because I drew him out of the water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown, that he went out to his brethren, and looked on their burdens: and he spied an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And he looked this way and that way, and when he saw that there was no man, he slew the Egyptian, and hid him in the sand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And when he went out the second day, behold, two men of the Hebrews strove together: and he said to him that did the wrong, Why smitest thou thy fellow? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And he said, Who made thee a prince and a judge over us? intendest thou to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? And Moses feared, and said, Surely this thing is known. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Now when Pharaoh heard this thing, he sought to slay Moses. But Moses fled from the face of Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of Midian: and he sat down by a well. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters: and they came and drew water, and filled the troughs to water their father's flock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the shepherds came and drove them away: but Moses stood up and helped them, and watered their flock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, How is it that you are come so soon to day? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us from the hand of the shepherds, and also drew water enough for us, and watered the flock. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why is it that ye have left the man? call him, that he may eat bread. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And Moses was content to dwell with the man: and he gave Moses Zipporah his daughter. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And she bore him a son, and he called his name Gershom: for he said, I have been a stranger in a strange land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And it came to pass in process of time, that the king of Egypt died: and the children of Israel sighed by reason of the bondage, and they cried; and their cry ascended to God, by reason of the bondage. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> And God heard their groaning, and God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> And God looked upon the children of Israel, and God had respect to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Now Moses kept the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the priest of Midian: and he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush: and he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And Moses said, I will now turn aside, and see this great sight, why the bush is not burnt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And when the LORD saw that he turned aside to see, God called to him out of the midst of the bush, and said, Moses, Moses. And he said, Here am I. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And he said, Approach not hither: put off thy shoes from thy feet, for the place on which thou standest is holy ground. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> Moreover he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face: for he was afraid to look upon God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And the LORD said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry by reason of their task-masters; for I know their sorrows; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And I am come down to deliver them from the hand of the Egyptians, and to bring them out of that land, to a good land, and a large, to a land flowing with milk and honey; to the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come to me: and I have also seen the oppression with which the Egyptians oppress them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Come now therefore, and I will send thee to Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel out of Egypt? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And he said, Certainly I will be with thee; and this shall be a token to thee, that I have sent thee: When thou hast brought forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this mountain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And Moses said to God, Behold, when I come to the children of Israel, and shall say to them, The God of your fathers hath sent me to you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What shall I say to them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: And he said, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And God said, moreover, to Moses, Thus shalt thou say to the children of Israel, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath sent me to you: this is my name for ever, and this is my memorial to all generations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Go and assemble the elders of Israel, and say to them, The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I have surely visited you, and seen that which is done to you in Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And I have said, I will bring you out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, to a land flowing with milk and honey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And they shall hearken to thy voice: and thou shalt come, thou and the elders of Israel, to the king of Egypt, and ye shall say to him, The LORD God of the Hebrews hath met with us: and now let us go (we beseech thee) three days journey into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> And I am sure that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no, not by a mighty hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> And I will stretch out my hand, and smite Egypt with all my wonders which I will do in the midst thereof: and after that he will let you go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And I will give this people favor in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that when ye go, ye shall not go empty: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> But every woman shall borrow of her neighbor, and of her that dwelleth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters: and ye shall spoil the Egyptians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not believe me, nor hearken to my voice: for they will say, The LORD hath not appeared to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And the LORD said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he said, A rod. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the ground, and it became a serpent: and Moses fled from before it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Put forth thy hand, and take it by the tail. And he put forth his hand, and caught it, and it became a rod in his hand: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> That they may believe that the LORD God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath appeared to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And the LORD said furthermore to him, Put now thy hand into thy bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom: and when he took it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put his hand into his bosom again, and drew it out of his bosom, and behold, it was turned again as his other flesh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee, neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will believe the voice of the latter sign. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also these two signs, neither hearken to thy voice, that thou shalt take of the water of the river, and pour it upon the dry land: and the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon the dry land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And Moses said to the LORD, O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoke to thy servant: but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And the LORD said to him, Who hath made man's mouth? or who maketh the dumb, or deaf, or the seeing, or the blind? have not I the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Now therefore go, and I will be with thy mouth, and teach thee what thou shalt say. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he said, O my Lord, send, I pray thee, by the hand of him whom thou wilt send. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Moses, and he said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can speak well. And also behold, he cometh forth to meet thee: and when he seeth thee, he will be glad in his heart. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And thou shalt speak to him, and put words in his mouth: and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and will teach you what ye shall do. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And he shall speak for thee to the people: and he shall be, even he shall be to thee instead of a mouth, and thou shalt be to him instead of God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And thou shalt take this rod in thy hand, with which thou shalt perform signs. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my brethren who are in Egypt, and see whether they are yet alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And the LORD said to Moses in Midian, Go, return into Egypt; for all the men are dead who sought thy life. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And Moses took his wife, and his sons, and set them upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses took the rod of God in his hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And the LORD said to Moses, When thou goest to return into Egypt, see that thou perform all those wonders before Pharaoh which I have put in thy hand: but I will harden his heart, that he shall not let the people go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD, Israel is my son, even my first-born. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me: and if thou shalt refuse to let him go, behold, I will slay thy son, even thy first-born. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> And it came to pass by the way in the inn, that the LORD met him, and sought to kill him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> Then Zipporah took a sharp stone, and cut off the foreskin of her son, and cast it at his feet, and said, Surely a bloody husband art thou to me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> So he let him go: then she said, A bloody husband thou art, because of the circumcision. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> And the LORD said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet Moses. And he went, and met him in the mount of God, and kissed him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> And Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD who had sent him, and all the signs which he had commanded him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> And Moses and Aaron went, and assembled all the elders of the children of Israel: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> And Aaron spoke all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses, and performed the signs in the sight of the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> And the people believed: and when they heard that the LORD had visited the children of Israel, and that he had looked upon their affliction, then they bowed their heads, and worshiped. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast to me in the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And Pharaoh said, Who is the LORD, that I should obey his voice to let Israel go? I know not the LORD, neither will I let Israel go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And they said, The God of the Hebrews hath met with us: let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the desert, and sacrifice to the LORD our God; lest he fall upon us with pestilence, or with the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and Aaron, hinder the people from their works; go you to your burdens. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And Pharaoh said, Behold, the people of the land now are many, and ye make them rest from their burdens. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And Pharaoh commanded the same day the task-masters of the people, and their officers, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as heretofore; let them go and gather straw for themselves. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And the number of the bricks which they made heretofore, ye shall lay upon them; ye shall not diminish aught thereof; for they are idle: therefore they cry, saying, Let us go and sacrifice to our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Let more work be laid upon the men, that they may labor therein: and let them not regard vain words. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And the task-masters of the people went out, and their officers, and they spoke to the people, saying, Thus saith Pharaoh, I will not give you straw. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Go ye, get you straw where ye can find it: yet not aught of your work shall be diminished. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> So the people were scattered abroad throughout all the land of Egypt, to gather stubble instead of straw. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And the task-masters hastened them, saying, Fulfill your works, your daily tasks, as when there was straw. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And the officers of the children of Israel, which Pharaoh's task-masters had set over them, were beaten, and demanded, Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both yesterday and to-day, as heretofore? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried to Pharaoh, saying, Why dealest thou thus with thy servants? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> There is no straw given to thy servants, and they say to us, Make brick: and behold, thy servants are beaten; but the fault is in thy own people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> But he said, Ye are idle, ye are idle: therefore ye say, Let us go, and do sacrifice to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Go therefore now, and work; for there shall no straw be given you, yet shall ye deliver the number of bricks. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And the officers of the children of Israel saw that they were in evil case, after it was said, Ye shall not diminish aught from your bricks of your daily task. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood in the way, as they came forth from Pharaoh: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> And they said to them, The LORD look upon you, and judge; because ye have made our savor to be abhorred in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes of his servants, to put a sword in their hands to slay us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Lord, why hast thou so ill treated this people? why is it that thou hast sent me? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> For since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy people at all. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Then the LORD said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do to Pharaoh; for with a strong hand shall he let them go, and with a strong hand shall he drive them from his land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am the LORD: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, by the name of God Almighty, but by my name JEHOVAH was I not known to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And I have also established my covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they were strangers. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And I have also heard the groaning of the children of Israel, whom the Egyptians keep in bondage: and I have remembered my covenant. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Wherefore say to the children of Israel, I am the LORD, and I will bring you from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, and I will redeem you with out-stretched arm, and with great judgments: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And I will take you to me for a people, and I will be to you a God: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God, who bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And I will bring you into the land, concerning which I swore to give it to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob; and I will give it to you for a heritage: I am the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And Moses spoke so to the children of Israel: but they hearkened not to Moses, by reason of anguish of spirit, and cruel bondage. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p>

 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and they did so as the LORD had commanded: And Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Then Pharaoh also called the wise-men, and the sorcerers: now the magicians of Egypt, they also did in like manner with their enchantments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron's rod swallowed up their rods. </p>

 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And Moses and Aaron did so, as the LORD commanded; and he lifted up the rod and smote the waters that were in the river, in the sight of Pharaoh, and in the sight of his servants; and all the waters that were in the river were turned into blood. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And the fish that was in the river died; and the river was offensive in smell, and the Egyptians could not drink of the water of the river; and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> And the magicians of Egypt did so with their enchantments: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, neither did he hearken to them; as the LORD had said. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, neither did he regard this also. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And all the Egyptians digged round about the river for water to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> And seven days were fulfilled after that the LORD had smitten the river. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, Go to Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go that they may serve me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And if thou shalt refuse to let them go, behold, I will smite all thy borders with frogs: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And the river shall bring forth frogs abundantly, which shall go up and come into thy house, and into thy bed-chamber, and upon thy bed, and into the house of thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy ovens, and into thy kneading troughs: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And the frogs shall come up both on thee, and upon thy people, and upon all thy servants. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch forth thy hand with thy rod over the streams, over the rivers, and over the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt; and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And the magicians did so with their enchantments, and brought up frogs upon the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron, and said, Entreat the LORD that he may take away the frogs from me, and from my people: and I will let the people go, that they may do sacrifice to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me: when shall I entreat for thee, and for thy servants, and for thy people, to destroy the frogs from thee, and thy houses, that they may remain in the river only? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And he said, To-morrow. And he said, Be it according to thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses, and from thy servants, and from thy people; they shall remain in the river only. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh: and Moses cried to the LORD, because of the frogs which he had brought against Pharaoh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses: and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the villages, and out of the fields. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And they gathered them into heaps: and the land was offensive in smell. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> But when Pharaoh saw that there was respit, he hardened his heart, and hearkened not to them, as the LORD had said. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Say to Aaron, Stretch out thy rod, and smite the dust of the land, that it may become lice throughout all the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And they did so: for Aaron stretched out his hand with his rod, and smote the dust of the earth, and it became lice in man and in beast; all the dust of the land became lice throughout all the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And the magicians did so with their inchantments to bring forth lice, but they could not: so there were lice upon man and upon beast. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of God: and Pharaoh's heart was hardened, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had said. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh; (lo, he cometh forth to the water) and say to him, Thus saith the LORD, Let my people go, that they may serve me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> Else, if thou wilt not let my people go, behold, I will send swarms of flies upon thee, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people, and into thy houses: and the houses of the Egyptians shall be full of swarms of flies, and also the ground on which they are. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> And I will sever in that day the land of Goshen, in which my people dwell, that no swarms of flies shall be there; to the end thou mayest know that I am the LORD in the midst of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> And I will put a division between my people and thy people: to-morrow shall this sign be. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> And the LORD did so: and there came a grievous swarm of flies into the house of Pharaoh, and into his servants' houses, and into all the land of Egypt: the land was corrupted by reason of the swarm of flies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> And Pharaoh called for Moses, and for Aaron, and said, Go ye, sacrifice to your God in the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> And Moses said, It is not meet so to do; for we shall sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to the LORD our God: Lo, shall we sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians before their eyes, and will they not stone us? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and sacrifice to the LORD our God as he shall command us. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that ye may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only ye shall not go very far away: entreat for me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and I will entreat the LORD that the swarms of flies may depart from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people, to-morrow: but let not Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more, in not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> And the LORD did according to the word of Moses; and he removed the swarms of flies from Pharaoh, from his servants, and from his people; there remained not one. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> And Pharaoh hardened his heart at this time also, neither would he let the people go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Then the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh, and tell him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> For if thou shalt refuse to let them go, and wilt hold them still, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> Behold, the hand of the LORD is upon thy cattle which are in the field, upon the horses, upon the asses, upon the camels, upon the oxen, and upon the sheep: there shall be a very grievous murrain. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> And the LORD shall sever between the cattle of Israel, and the cattle of Egypt: and there shall nothing die of all that belongs to the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And the LORD appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow the LORD will do this thing in the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And the LORD did that thing on the morrow, and all the cattle of Egypt died: but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the cattle of the Israelites dead. And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, and he did not let the people go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And the LORD said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to you handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses sprinkle it towards heaven in the sight of Pharaoh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And it shall become small dust in all the land of Egypt, and shall be a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast, throughout all the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it towards heaven; and it became a boil breaking forth with blains upon man, and upon beast. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And the magicians could not stand before Moses, because of the boil: for the boil was upon the magicians, and upon all the Egyptians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he hearkened not to them; as the LORD had spoke to Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Rise early in the morning, and stand before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, Let my people go, that they may serve me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> For I will at this time send all my plagues upon thy heart, and upon thy servants, and upon thy people: that thou mayest know that there is none like me in all the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> For now I will stretch out my hand, that I may smite thee and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And in very deed for this cause have I raised thee up, to show in thee my power; and that my name may be declared throughout all the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> As yet dost thou exalt thyself against my people, that thou wilt not let them go? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since its foundation even until now. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> Send therefore now, and gather thy cattle, and all that thou hast in the field: for upon every man and beast which shall be found in the field, and shall not be brought home, the hail shall come down upon them, and they shall die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> He that feared the word of the LORD, among the servants of Pharaoh, made his servants and his cattle flee into the houses: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And he that regarded not the word of the LORD, left his servants and his cattle in the field. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch forth thy hand towards heaven, that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, upon man, and upon beast, and upon every herb of the field, throughout the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And Moses stretched forth his rod towards heaven, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground: and the LORD rained hail upon the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> So there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land of Egypt, since it became a nation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And the hail smote, throughout all the land of Egypt, all that was in the field, both man and beast, and the hail smote every herb of the field and broke every tree of the field. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel were, there was no hail. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> And Pharaoh sent, and called for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, I have sinned this time: the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> Entreat the LORD (for it is enough) that there be no more mighty thunderings and hail; and I will let you go, and ye shall stay no longer. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> And Moses said to him, As soon as I am gone out of the city, I will spread abroad my hands to the LORD; and the thunder shall cease, neither shall there be any more hail; that thou mayest know how that the earth is the LORD'S. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> But as for thee and thy servants, I know that ye will not yet fear the LORD God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> And the flax and the barley were smitten: for the barley was in the ear, and the flax was bolled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:32">9:32</a> But the wheat and the rye were not smitten; for they were not grown up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:33">9:33</a> And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread abroad his hands to the LORD: and the thunders and hail ceased, and the rain was not poured upon the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:34">9:34</a> And when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders had ceased, he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he and his servants. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:35">9:35</a> And the heart of Pharaoh was hardened, neither would he let the children of Israel go; as the LORD had spoken by Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Go in to Pharaoh: for I have hardened his heart, and the heart of his servants; that I might show these my signs before him: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> And that thou mayest tell in the ears of thy son, and of thy son's son, what things I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I have done among them; that ye may know how that I am the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And Moses and Aaron came in to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus saith the LORD God of the Hebrews, How long wilt thou refuse to humble thyself before me? Let my people go, that they may serve me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> Else, if thou shalt refuse to let my people go, behold, to-morrow will I bring the locusts into thy border: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And they shall cover the face of the earth, that one cannot be able to see the earth: and they shall eat the residue of that which hath escaped, which remaineth to you from the hail, and shall eat every tree which groweth for you out of the field: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy servants, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy fathers, nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that they were upon the earth to this day. And he turned himself, and went out from Pharaoh. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And Pharaoh's servants said to him, How long shall this man be a snare to us? Let the men go, that they may serve the LORD their God: knowest thou not yet that Egypt is destroyed? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh: and he said to them, Go, serve the LORD your God: but who are they that shall go? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old, with our sons and with our daughters, with our flocks and with our herds will we go; for we must hold a feast to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And he said to them, Let the LORD be so with you, as I will let you go, and your little ones: look to it; for evil is before you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> Not so: go now ye that are men, and serve the LORD; for that you desired. And they were driven out from Pharaoh's presence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come upon the land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land, even all that the hail hath left. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And Moses stretched forth his rod over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind upon the land all that day, and all that night: and when it was morning, the east wind brought the locusts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and rested in all the borders of Egypt: very grievous were they; before them there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be such. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> For they covered the face of the whole earth, so that the land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left: and there remained not any green thing on the trees, or in the herbs of the field, through all the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said, I have sinned against the LORD your God, and against you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> Now therefore forgive, I pray thee, my sin only this once, and entreat the LORD your God that he may take away from me this death only. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> And he went out from Pharaoh, and entreated the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And the LORD turned a mighty strong west wind which took away the locusts, and cast them into the Red sea: there remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand towards heaven, that there may be darkness over the land of Egypt, even darkness which may be felt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> And Moses stretched forth his hand towards heaven: and there was a thick darkness in all the land of Egypt three days: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> They saw not one another, neither rose any from his place for three days: but all the children of Israel had light in their dwellings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> And Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, Go ye, serve the LORD; only let your flocks and your herds be stayed: let your little ones also go with you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> And Moses said, Thou must give us also sacrifices, and burnt-offerings, that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> Our cattle also shall go with us; there shall not a hoof be left behind; for of them must we take to serve the LORD our God; and we know not with what we must serve the LORD, until we come thither. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he would not let them go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> And Pharaoh said to him, Depart from me, take heed to thyself, see my face no more: for in that day thou seest my face, thou shalt die. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> And Moses said, Thou hast spoken well, I will see thy face again no more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Yet will I bring one plague more upon Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence: when he shall let you go, he shall surely thrust you out hence altogether. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neighbor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was very great in the land of Egypt, in the sight of Pharaoh's servants, and in the sight of the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And Moses said, Thus saith the LORD, About midnight will I go out into the midst of Egypt: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And all the first-born in the land of Egypt shall die, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne, even to the first-born of the maid-servant that is behind the mill; and all the first-born of beasts. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And there shall be a great cry throughout all the land of Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like it any more. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog move his tongue, against man or beast: that ye may know how the LORD doth put a difference between the Egyptians and Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And all these thy servants shall come down to me, and bow down themselves to me, saying, Depart thou, and all the people that follow thee; and after that I will depart: and he went out from Pharaoh in a great anger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Pharaoh will not hearken to you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh; and the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, so that he would not let the children of Israel depart from his land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> This month shall be to you the beginning of months: it shall be the first month of the year to you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> Speak ye to all the congregation of Israel, saying, In the tenth day of this month they shall take to them every man a lamb, according to the house of their fathers, a lamb for a house: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And if the household shall be too small for the lamb, let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the souls; every man according to his eating shall make your count for the lamb. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year: ye shall take it from the sheep or from the goats: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month: and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side-posts, and on the upper door-post of the houses, in which they shall eat it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roasted with fire; and unleavened bread, and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> Eat not of it raw, nor boiled at all with water, but roasted with fire; its head with its legs, and with its entrails. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And ye shall let nothing of it remain till the morning: and that which remaineth of it till the morning ye shall burn with fire. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand: and ye shall eat it in haste; it is the LORD'S passover. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both man and beast: and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment: I am the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And the blood shall be to you for a token upon the houses where ye are: and when I see the blood, I will pass over you, and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you, when I smite the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> And this day shall be to you for a memorial; and ye shall keep it a feast to the LORD throughout your generations: ye shall keep it a feast by an ordinance for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread; even the first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses: for whoever eateth leavened bread, from the first day till the seventh day, that soul shall be cut off from Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And in the first day there shall be a holy convocation, and in the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation to you: no manner of work shall be done in them, save that which every man must eat, that only may be done by you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And ye shall observe the feast of unleavened bread; for in this same day have I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt: therefore shall ye observe this day in your generations by an ordinance for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread, till the one and twentieth day of the month at evening. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> Seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses: for whoever eateth that which is leavened, even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether he shall be a stranger, or born in the land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your habitations shall ye eat unleavened bread. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said to them, Draw out, and take you a lamb, according to your families, and kill the passover. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side-posts with the blood that is in the basin: and none of you shall go out at the door of his house till the morning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> For the LORD will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side-posts, the LORD will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in to your houses to smite you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> And it shall come to pass, when ye shall have come to the land which the LORD will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:26">12:26</a> And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to you, What mean you by this service? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:27">12:27</a> That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the LORD'S passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> And the children of Israel went away, and did as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:29">12:29</a> And it came to pass, that at midnight the LORD smote all the first-born in the land of Egypt, from the first-born of Pharaoh that sat on his throne, to the first-born of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the first-born of cattle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:30">12:30</a> And Pharaoh rose in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt: for there was not a house where there was not one dead. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:31">12:31</a> And he called for Moses and Aaron by night, and said, Arise, and depart from among my people, both ye and the children of Israel: and go, serve the LORD, as ye have said. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:32">12:32</a> Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and be gone: and bless me also. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:33">12:33</a> And the Egyptians were urgent upon the people, that they might send them out of the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:34">12:34</a> And the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading troughs being bound up in their clothes upon their shoulders. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:35">12:35</a> And the children of Israel did according to the word of Moses: and they borrowed of the Egyptians jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:36">12:36</a> And the LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they lent to them such things as they requested: and they spoiled the Egyptians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:37">12:37</a> And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot that were men, besides children. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:38">12:38</a> And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks, and herds, even very many cattle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:39">12:39</a> And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt, for it was not leavened: because they were driven from Egypt, and could not tarry, neither had they prepared for themselves any victuals. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:40">12:40</a> Now the sojourning of the children of Israel who dwelt in Egypt, was four hundred and thirty years. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:41">12:41</a> And it came to pass, at the end of the four hundred and thirty years, even the same day it came to pass, that all the hosts of the LORD departed from the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:42">12:42</a> It is a night to be much observed to the LORD, for bringing them out from the land of Egypt: this is that night of the LORD to be observed by all the children of Israel in their generations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:43">12:43</a> And the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance of the passover: there shall no stranger eat of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:44">12:44</a> But every man's servant that is bought for money, when thou hast circumcised him, then shall he eat of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:45">12:45</a> A foreigner, and a hired servant shall not eat of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:46">12:46</a> In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry aught of the flesh abroad out of the house: neither shall ye break a bone of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:47">12:47</a> All the congregation of Israel shall keep it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:48">12:48</a> And when a stranger shall sojourn with thee, and will keep the passover to the LORD, let all his males be circumcised, and then let him come near and keep it; and he shall be as one that is born in the land: for no uncircumcised person shall eat of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:49">12:49</a> One law shall be to him that is home-born, and to the stranger that sojourneth among you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:50">12:50</a> Thus did all the children of Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:51">12:51</a> And it came to pass the same day, that the LORD brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> Sanctify to me all the first-born, whatever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for by strength of hand the LORD brought you out from this place: there shall no leavened bread be eaten. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> This day ye came out in the month Abib. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Amorites, and the Hivites, and the Jebusites, which he swore to thy fathers to give thee, a land flowing with milk and honey; that thou shalt keep this service in this month. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, and in the seventh day shall be a feast to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Unleavened bread shall be eaten seven days: and there shall no leavened bread be seen with thee, neither shall there be leaven seen with thee in all thy quarters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And thou shalt show thy son in that day, saying, This is done because of that which the LORD did to me when I came forth out of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And it shall be for a sign to thee upon thy hand, and for a memorial between thy eyes; that the LORD'S law may be in thy mouth: for with a strong hand hath the LORD brought thee out of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> Thou shalt therefore keep this ordinance in its season from year to year. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> And it shall be when the LORD shall bring thee into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to thee and to thy fathers, and shall give it to thee, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> That thou shall set apart to the LORD all that openeth the matrix; and every firstling that cometh of a beast which thou hast, the males shall be the LORD'S. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And every firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb; and if thou wilt not redeem it, then thou shalt break his neck: and all the first-born of man among thy children shalt thou redeem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> And it shall be when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What is this? that thou shalt say to him, By strength of hand the LORD brought us out from Egypt, from the house of bondage: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And it came to pass, when Pharaoh would hardly let us go, that the LORD slew all the first-born in the land of Egypt, both the first-born of man, and the first-born of beasts: therefore I sacrifice to the LORD all that openeth the matrix, being males; but all the first-born of my children I redeem. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And it shall be for a token upon thy hand, and for frontlets between thy eyes: for by strength of hand the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And it came to pass, when Pharaoh had let the people go, that God led them not through the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near, for God said, Lest peradventure the people repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> But God led the people about, through the way of the wilderness of the Red Sea: and the children of Israel went up harnassed from the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him: for he had strictly sworn the children of Israel, saying, God will surely visit you; and ye shall carry up my bones hence with you. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in Etham, in the edge of the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> And the LORD went before them by day in a pillar of a cloud, to lead them in the way; and by night in a pillar of fire, to give them light: to go by day and night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> He took not away the pillar of the cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from before the people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> Speak to the children of Israel, that they turn and encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea, over against Baal-zephon: before it shall ye encamp by the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> For Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are entangled in the land, the wilderness hath shut them in. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he shall follow them; and I will be honored upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host; that the Egyptians may know that I am the LORD. And they did so. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And it was told to the king of Egypt that the people fled: and the heart of Pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have let Israel go from serving us? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And he made ready his chariot, and took his people with him: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he pursued the children of Israel: and the children of Israel went out with a high hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> But the Egyptians pursued them (all the horses and chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army) and overtook them encamping by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, before Baal-zephon. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them; and they were greatly afraid; and the children of Israel cried to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And they said to Moses, Because there were no graves in Egypt, hast thou taken us away to die in the wilderness? Why hast thou dealt thus with us, to conduct us out of Egypt? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> Is not this the word that we told thee in Egypt, Saying, Let us alone, that we may serve the Egyptians? For it had been better for us to serve the Egyptians, than that we should die in the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And Moses said to the people, Fear ye not, stand still, and see the salvation of the LORD, which he will show to you to-day: for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall see them again no more for ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> The LORD will fight for you, and ye shall hold your peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Why criest thou to me? Speak to the children of Israel, that they go forward: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> But lift thou thy rod, and stretch out thy hand over the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on dry ground through the midst of the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And I, behold I, will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they shall follow them: and I will get me honor upon Pharaoh, and upon all his host, upon his chariots and upon his horsemen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And the Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I have gotten me honor upon Pharaoh, upon his chariots, and upon his horsemen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> And the angel of God, who went before the camp of Israel, removed, and went behind them; and the pillar of the cloud went from before their face, and stood behind them: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> And it came between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel; and it was a cloud and darkness to them, but it gave light by night to these: so that the one came not near the other all the night. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the LORD caused the sea to go back by a strong east wind all that night, and made the sea dry land, and the waters were divided. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> And the children of Israel went into the midst of the sea upon the dry ground: and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> And the Egyptians pursued, and went in after them to the midst of the sea, even all Pharaoh's horses, his chariots, and his horsemen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> And it came to pass, that, in the morning-watch, the LORD looked to the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire, and of the cloud, and troubled the host of the Egyptians, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> And took off their chariot-wheels, and made them to move heavily, so that the Egyptians said, Let us flee from the face of Israel; for the LORD fighteth for them against the Egyptians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the sea, that the waters may come again upon the Egyptians, upon their chariots, and upon their horsemen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> And Moses stretched forth his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its strength when the morning appeared; and the Egyptians fled against it; and the LORD overthrew the Egyptians in the midst of the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> And the waters returned, and covered the chariots, and the horsemen, and all the host of Pharaoh that came into the sea after them; there remained not so much as one of them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:29">14:29</a> But the children of Israel walked upon dry land in the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on their right hand, and on their left. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:30">14:30</a> Thus the LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians: and Israel saw the Egyptians dead upon the sea-shore. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:31">14:31</a> And Israel saw that great work which the LORD did upon the Egyptians: and the people feared the LORD, and believed the LORD, and his servant Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to the LORD, and spoke, saying, I will sing to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> The LORD is my strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and I will prepare him a habitation; my father's God, and I will exalt him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> The LORD is a man of war: the LORD is his name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> Pharaoh's chariots and his host hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are drowned in the Red sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> The depths have covered them: they sunk to the bottom as a stone. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> Thy right hand, O LORD, is become glorious in power: thy right hand, O LORD, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And in the greatness of thy excellence thou hast overthrown them that rose up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which consumed them as stubble. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And with the blast of thy nostrils the waters were collected, the floods stood upright as a heap, and the depths were congealed in the heart of the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be satisfied upon them; I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> Thou didst blow with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sunk as lead in the mighty waters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> Who is like to thee, O LORD, among the gods? who is like thee, glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing wonders! </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength to thy holy habitation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> The people shall hear, and be afraid: sorrow shall take hold on the inhabitants of Palestina. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> Then the dukes of Edom shall be amazed; the mighty men of Moab, trembling shall take hold upon them; all the inhabitants of Canaan shall melt away. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> Fear and dread shall fall upon them; by the greatness of thy arm they shall be as still as a stone; till thy people pass over, O LORD, till the people pass over, which thou hast purchased. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance, in the place, O LORD, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in; in the sanctuary, O Lord. which thy hands have established. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> The LORD shall reign for ever and ever. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> For the horse of Pharaoh went in with his chariots and with his horsemen into the sea, and the LORD brought again the waters of the sea upon them; but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all the women went out after her, with timbrels, and with dances. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> And Miriam answered them, Sing ye to the LORD, for he hath triumphed gloriously; the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:22">15:22</a> So Moses brought Israel from the Red sea, and they went out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in the wilderness, and found no water. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:23">15:23</a> And when they came to Marah, they could not drink of the waters of Marah; for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called Marah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:24">15:24</a> And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall we drink? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> And he cried to the LORD; and the LORD showed him a tree, which he cast into the waters, and the waters were made sweet: there he made for them a statute and an ordinance, and there he proved them, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> And said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, and wilt do that which is right in his sight, and wilt give ear to his commandments, and keep all his statutes; I will put none of these diseases upon thee, which I have brought upon the Egyptians; for I am the LORD that healeth thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:27">15:27</a> And they came to Elim, where were twelve wells of water, and seventy palm-trees: and they encamped there by the waters. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And they took their journey from Elim, and all the congregation of the children of Israel came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> And the whole congregation of the children of Israel murmured against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> And the children of Israel said to them, O that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the flesh-pots, and when we did eat bread to the full: for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness, to kill this whole assembly with hunger. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> Then said the LORD to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day, that I may prove them, whether they will walk in my law, or not. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And it shall come to pass, that on the sixth day they shall prepare that which they bring in; and it shall be twice as much as they gather daily. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, At evening, then ye shall know that the LORD hath brought you out from the land of Egypt: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> And in the morning, then ye shall see the glory of the LORD; for that he heareth your murmurings against the LORD: And what are we, that ye murmur against us? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> And Moses said, This shall be when the LORD shall give you in the evening flesh to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for that the LORD heareth your murmurings which ye murmur against him: And what are we? your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, Come near before the LORD: for he hath heard your murmurings. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And it came to pass, as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of the children of Israel, that they looked towards the wilderness, and behold, the glory of the LORD appeared in the cloud. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel; Speak to them, saying, At evening ye shall eat flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread: and ye shall know that I am the LORD your God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And it came to pass, that at evening the quails came up, and covered the camp: and in the morning the dew lay around the host. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> And when the dew that lay was gone up, behold, upon the face of the wilderness there lay a small round thing, as small as the hoar frost on the ground: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> And when the children of Israel saw it, they said one to another, It is manna: for they knew not what it was. And Moses said to them, This is the bread which the LORD hath given you to eat. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> This is the thing which the LORD hath commanded, Gather of it every man according to his eating: an omer for every man according to the number of your persons, take ye every man for them who are in his tents. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some more, some less. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And when they measured it with an omer, he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack: they gathered every man according to his eating. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And Moses said, Let no man leave of it till the morning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> Notwithstanding, they hearkened not to Moses; but some of them left of it until the morning, and it bred worms, and became offensive; and Moses was wroth with them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> And they gathered it every morning, every man according to his eating: and when the sun became hot, it melted. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> And it came to pass, that on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for one man: and all the rulers of the congregation came and told Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> And he said to them, This is that which the LORD hath said, To-morrow is the rest of the holy sabbath to the LORD: bake that which ye will bake to-day, and boil that ye will boil; and that which remaineth over, lay up for you to be kept until the morning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> And they laid it up till the morning, as Moses ordered: and it did not putrefy, neither was there any worm therein. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> And Moses said, Eat that to-day; for to-day is a sabbath to the LORD; to-day ye will not find it in the field. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> Six days ye shall gather it; but on the seventh day, which is the sabbath, in it there will be none. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> And it came to pass, that some of the people went out on the seventh day to gather, and they found none. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> And the LORD said to Moses, How long refuse ye to keep my commandments and my laws? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> See, for that the LORD hath given you the sabbath, therefore he giveth you on the sixth day the bread of two days: abide ye every man in his place, let no man go out of his place on the seventh day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> So the people rested on the seventh day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> And the house of Israel called its name Manna: and it was like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like wafers made with honey. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations; that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you forth from the land of Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put an omer full of manna therein, and lay it up before the LORD, to be kept for your generations. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron laid it up before the Testimony, to be kept. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> And the children of Israel ate manna forty years, until they came to a land inhabited: they ate manna, until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> Now an omer is the tenth part of an ephah. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And all the congregation of the children of Israel journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after their journeys, according to the commandment of the LORD, and encamped in Rephidim: and there was no water for the people to drink. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> Wherefore the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us water that we may drink. And Moses said to them, Why chide you with me? why do ye tempt the LORD? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> And the people thirsted there for water; and the people murmured against Moses, and said, Why is this that thou hast brought us out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our cattle with thirst? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And Moses cried to the LORD, saying, What shall I do to this people? they are almost ready to stone me. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Go on before the people, and take with thee of the elders of Israel: and thy rod, with which thou smotest the river, take in thy hand, and go. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> Behold, I will stand before thee there on the rock in Horeb; and thou shalt smite the rock, and water shall come out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah, because of the chiding of the children of Israel, and because they tempted the LORD, saying, Is the LORD among us, or not? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> Then came Amalek, and fought with Israel in Rephidim. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us out men, and go out, fight with Amalek: to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> So Joshua did as Moses had said to him, and fought with Amalek: and Moses, Aaron, and Hur, went up to the top of the hill. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> And it came to pass, when Moses held up his hand, that Israel prevailed: and when he let down his hand, Amalek prevailed. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> But Moses's hands were heavy; and they took a stone, and put it under him, and he sat upon it: and Aaron and Hur supported his hands, the one on the one side, and the other on the other side; and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> And Joshua discomfited Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Write this for a memorial in a book, and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua: for I will utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under heaven. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it JEHOVAH-nissi: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> For he said, Because the LORD hath sworn that the LORD will have war with Amalek from generation to generation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> When Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses's father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses, and for Israel his people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> Then Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took Zipporah Moses's wife, after he had sent her back, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> And her two sons; of which the name of the one was Gershom; (for he said, I have been an alien in a strange land:) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> And the name of the other was Eliezer; (for the God of my father, said he, was my help, and delivered me from the sword of Pharaoh:) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, came with his sons and his wife to Moses into the wilderness, where he encamped at the mount of God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And he said to Moses, I thy father-in-law Jethro have come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did obeisance, and kissed him: and they asked each other of their welfare: and they came into the tent. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> And Moses told his father-in-law all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh, and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake, and all the travail that had come upon them by the way, and how the LORD delivered them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness which the LORD had done to Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And Jethro said, Blessed be the LORD, who hath delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, who hath delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods: for in the thing in which they dealt proudly, he was above them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And Jethro, Moses's father-in-law, took a burnt-offering and sacrifices for God: and Aaron came, and all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses's father-in-law before God. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the morning to the evening. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> And when Moses's father-in-law saw all that he did to the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? Why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning to evening? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people come to me to inquire of God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge between one and another, and I make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And Moses's father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou doest is not good. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou art not able to perform it thyself alone. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> Hearken now to my voice, I will give thee counsel, and God shall be with thee: Be thou for the people toward God, that thou mayest bring the causes to God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> And thou shalt teach them ordinances and laws, and shalt show them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they must do. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> Moreover, thou shalt provide out of all the people, able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place such over them to be rulers of thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> And let them judge the people at all seasons: and it shall be, that every great matter they shall bring to thee, but every small matter they shall judge: So shall it be easier for thyself, and they shall bear the burden with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> If thou shalt do this thing, and God command thee so, then thou shalt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to their place in peace. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> So Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and did all that he had said. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them heads over the people, rulers of thousands, rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> And they judged the people at all seasons: the hard causes they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged themselves. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> And Moses let his father-in-law depart; and he went his way into his own land. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> In the third month, when the children of Israel had gone forth from the land of Egypt, the same day they came into the wilderness of Sinai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> For they had departed from Rephidim, and had come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the wilderness; and there Israel encamped before the mount. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And Moses went up to God, and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of Jacob, and tell the children of Israel; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> Ye have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I bore you on eagles' wings, and brought you to myself. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> Now therefore, if ye will obey my voice indeed, and keep my covenant, then ye shall be a peculiar treasure to me above all people: for all the earth is mine: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak to the children of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> And Moses came and called for the elders of the people, and laid before their faces all these words which the LORD commanded him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And all the people answered together, and said, All that the LORD hath spoken we will do. And Moses returned the words of the people to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Lo, I come to thee in a thick cloud, that the people may hear when I speak with thee, and believe thee for ever. And Moses told the words of the people to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Go to the people, and sanctify them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And be ready against the third day: for on the third day the LORD will come down in the sight of all the people upon mount Sinai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> And thou shalt set bounds to the people round about, saying, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up upon the mount, or touch the border of it: whoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> There shall not a hand touch it, but he shall surely be stoned or shot through: whether it be beast or man, it shall not live: when the trumpet soundeth long, they shall come up to the mount. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And Moses went down from the mount to the people, and sanctified the people; and they washed their clothes. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> And he said to the people, Be ready against the third day: come not at your wives. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that were in the camp trembled. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And Moses brought forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at the nether part of the mount. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> And mount Sinai was altogether in a smoke, because the LORD descended upon it in fire: and the smoke of it ascended as the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mount trembled greatly. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> And when the voice of the trumpet sounded long, and grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> And the LORD came down upon mount Sinai, on the top of the mount: and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mount; and Moses went up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Go down, charge the people, lest they break through to the LORD to gaze, and many of them perish. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> And let the priests also who come near to the LORD, sanctify themselves, lest the LORD break forth upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> And Moses said to the LORD, The people cannot come up to mount Sinai: for thou chargedst us, saying, Set bounds about the mount, and sanctify it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> And the LORD said to him, Away, go down, and thou shalt come up, thou, and Aaron with thee: But let not the priests and the people break through, to come up to the LORD, lest he break forth upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> So Moses went down to the people, and spoke to them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And God spoke all these words, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> I am the LORD thy God, who have brought thee out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> Thou shalt have no other gods before me. </p>

 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And he took the calf which they had made, and burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed it upon the water, and made the children of Israel drink of it. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> And Moses said to Aaron, What did this people to thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin upon them? </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord wax hot: thou knowest the people that they are set on mischief. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> For they said to me, Make us gods which shall go before us: for as for this Moses, the man that brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> And I said to them, Whoever hath any gold, let them break it off: So they gave it to me: then I cast it into the fire, and there came out this calf. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> And when Moses saw that the people were naked (for Aaron had made them naked to their shame, among their enemies:) </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> Then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, Who is on the LORD'S side? let him come to me. And all the sons of Levi assembled themselves to him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> And he said to them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Put every man his sword by his side, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, and every man his companion, and every man his neighbor. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> And the children of Levi did according to the word of Moses: and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> For Moses had said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to the LORD, even every man upon his son, and upon his brother; that he may bestow upon you a blessing this day. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses said to the people, Ye have sinned a great sin: and now I will go up to the LORD; it may be I shall make an atonement for your sin. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> And Moses returned to the LORD, and said, Oh, this people have sinned a great sin, and have made them gods of gold. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> Yet now, if thou wilt, forgive their sin: and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me, him will I blot out of my book. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> Therefore now go, lead the people to the place of which I have spoken to thee: Behold, my angel shall go before thee: Nevertheless, in the day when I visit, I will visit their sin upon them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> And the LORD afflicted the people, because they made the calf which Aaron made. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Depart and go up hence, thou and the people which thou hast conducted from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, saying, to thy seed will I give it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> And I will send an angel before thee; and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> To a land flowing with milk and honey: for I will not go up in the midst of thee; for thou art a stiff-necked people: lest I consume thee in the way. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> And when the people heard these evil tidings, they mourned: and no man put on him his ornaments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> For the LORD had said to Moses, Say to the children of Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people: I will come up into the midst of thee in a moment, and consume thee: therefore now put off thy ornaments from thee, that I may know what to do to thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their ornaments, by the mount Horeb. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> And Moses took the tabernacle, and pitched it without the camp far from the camp, and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation. And it came to pass, that every one who sought the LORD, went out to the tabernacle of the congregation, which was without the camp. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> And it came to pass when Moses went out to the tabernacle, that all the people rose, and stood every man at his tent-door, and looked after Moses, until he had gone into the tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And it came to pass, as Moses entered into the tabernacle, the cloudy pillar descended, and stood at the door of the tabernacle, and the LORD talked with Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> And all the people saw the cloudy pillar stand at the tabernacle door: and all the people rose and worshiped, every man in his tent-door. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> And the LORD spoke to Moses face to face, as a man speaketh to his friend. And he turned again into the camp; but his servant Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not out of the tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> And Moses said to the LORD, See, thou sayest to me, Bring up this people: and thou hast not let me know whom thou wilt send with me. Yet thou hast said, I know thee by name, and thou hast also found grace in my sight. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> Now therefore, I pray thee, if I have found grace in thy sight, show me now thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find grace in thy sight: and consider that this nation is thy people. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> And he said, My presence shall attend thee, and I will give thee rest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> And he said to him, If thy presence shall not attend me, conduct us not hence. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> For wherein shall it be known here that I and thy people have found grace in thy sight? Is it not in that thou goest with us? So shall we be separated, I and thy people, from all the people that are upon the face of the earth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> And the LORD said to Moses, I will do this thing also that thou hast spoken: for thou hast found grace in my sight, and I know thee by name. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> And he said, I beseech thee, show me thy glory. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thee, and I will proclaim the name of the LORD before thee; and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> And he said, Thou canst not see my face: for there shall no man see me, and live. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> And the LORD said, Behold, there is a place by me, and thou shalt stand upon a rock: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> And it shall come to pass, while my glory passeth by, that I will put thee in a cleft of the rock: and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see my back parts: but my face shall not be seen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Hew thee two tables of stone like the first; and I will write upon these tables the words that were in the first tables which thou didst break. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> And be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning to mount Sinai, and present thyself there to me on the top of the mount. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> And no man shall come up with thee, neither let any man be seen throughout all the mount: neither let the flocks nor herds feed before that mount. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> And he hewed two tables of stone, like the first; and Moses rose up early in the morning, and went up to mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables of stone. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> And the LORD descended in the cloud, and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> And the LORD passed by before him, and proclaimed, The LORD, The LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-suffering, and abundant in goodness and truth. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> Keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, and that will by no means clear the guilty; visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and upon the children's children, to the third and to the fourth generation. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> And Moses made haste, and bowed his head towards the earth, and worshiped. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> And he said, If now I have found grace in thy sight, O Lord, let my Lord, I pray thee, go among us (for it is a stiff-necked people) and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for thy inheritance. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy people I will do wonders, such as have not been done in all the earth, nor in any nation: and all the people among which thou art, shall see the work of the LORD: for it is a terrible thing that I will do with thee. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> Observe thou that which I command thee this day: Behold, I drive out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> Take heed to thyself, lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land whither thou goest, lest it be for a snare in the midst of thee: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> But ye shall destroy their altars, break their images, and cut down their groves. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> For thou shalt worship no other god: for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> Lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land, and they go astray after their gods, and do sacrifice to their gods, and one call thee, and thou eat of his sacrifice; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:16">34:16</a> And thou take of their daughters to thy sons, and their daughters go astray after their gods, and make thy sons go astray after their gods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> Thou shalt make thee no molten gods. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> The feast of unleavened bread shalt thou keep. Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I commanded thee, in the time of the month Abib: for in the month Abib thou camest out of from Egypt. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> Every first-born is mine: and every firstling among thy cattle, whether ox or sheep, that is male. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> But the firstling of an ass thou shalt redeem with a lamb: and if thou shalt not redeem him, then shalt thou break his neck. All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt redeem. And none shall appear before me empty. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> Six days thou shalt work, but on the seventh day thou shalt rest: in time of plowing and in harvest thou shalt rest. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:22">34:22</a> And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of in-gathering at the year's end. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:23">34:23</a> Thrice in the year shall all your male children appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:24">34:24</a> For I will drive out the nations before thee, and enlarge thy borders: neither shall any man desire thy land, when thou shalt go up to appear before the LORD thy God, thrice in the year. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:25">34:25</a> Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with leaven, neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the passover be left until the morning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:26">34:26</a> The first of the first-fruits of thy land thou shalt bring to the house of the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid in his mother's milk. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:27">34:27</a> And the LORD said to Moses, Write thou these words: for after the tenor of these words I have made a covenant with thee, and with Israel. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:28">34:28</a> And he was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he neither ate bread nor drank water: and he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten commandments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:29">34:29</a> And it came to pass when Moses came down from mount Sinai (with the two tables of testimony in Moses's hand, when he came down from the mount) that Moses knew not that the skin of his face shone, while he talked with him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:30">34:30</a> And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:31">34:31</a> And Moses called to them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the congregation returned to him; and Moses talked with them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:32">34:32</a> And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in commandment all that the LORD had spoken with him in mount Sinai. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:33">34:33</a> And till Moses had done speaking with them, he put a vail on his face. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:34">34:34</a> But when Moses went in before the LORD to speak with him, he took the vail off, until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the children of Israel that which he was commanded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:35">34:35</a> And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the skin of Moses's face shone: and Moses put the vail upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> And Moses assembled all the congregation of the children of Israel, and said to them, These are the words which the LORD hath commanded, that ye should do them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> Six days shall work be done; but on the seventh day there shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to the LORD: whoever doth work therein shall be put to death. </p>

 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> Take ye from among you an offering to the LORD: whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass, </p>

 <p><a name="an_35:21">35:21</a> And they came, every one whose heart excited him, and every one whom his spirit made willing, and they brought the LORD'S offering to the work of the tabernacle of the congregation, and for all his service, and for the holy garments. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:22">35:22</a> And they came, both men and women, as many as were willing-hearted, and brought bracelets, and ear-rings, and rings, and tablets, all jewels of gold; and every man that offered, offered an offering of gold to the LORD. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:23">35:23</a> And every man, with whom was found blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine linen, and goats' hair, and red skins of rams, and badgers' skins, brought them. </p>

 <p><a name="an_35:25">35:25</a> And all the women that were wise-hearted spun with their hands, and brought that which they had spun, both of blue, and of purple, and of scarlet, and of fine linen. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:26">35:26</a> And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun goats' hair. </p>

 <p><a name="an_35:29">35:29</a> The children of Israel brought a willing offering to the LORD, every man and woman, whose heart made them willing to bring for all manner of work, which the LORD had commanded to be made by the hand of Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:30">35:30</a> And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, the LORD hath called by name Bezaleel, the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:31">35:31</a> And he hath filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom, in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of workmanship; </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:32">35:32</a> And to devise curious works, to work in gold, and in silver, and in brass, </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:33">35:33</a> And in the cutting of stones, to set them, and in carving of wood, to make any manner of curious work. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:34">35:34</a> And he hath put in his heart that he may teach, both he and Aholiab, the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:35">35:35</a> Them hath he filled with wisdom of heart, to work all manner of work, of the engraver, and of the skillful workmen, and of the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in fine linen, and of the weaver, even of them that do any work, and of those that devise curious work. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whom the LORD put wisdom and understanding, to know how to work all manner of work for the service of the sanctuary, according to all that the LORD had commanded. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every wise-hearted man, in whose heart the LORD had put wisdom, even every one whose heart excited him to come to the work to do it: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> And they received from Moses all the offering which the children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of the sanctuary, to make it. And they brought yet to him free-offerings every morning. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> And all the wise men, that wrought all the work of the sanctuary, came every man from his work which they made. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> And they spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than enough for the service of the work, which the LORD commanded to make. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> And Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be proclaimed throughout the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman make any more work for the offering of the sanctuary. So the people were restrained from bringing. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> For the stuff they had was sufficient for all the work to make it, and too much. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> And every wise-hearted man among them that wrought the work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and scarlet: he made them with cherubim of curious work. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> The length of one curtain was twenty and eight cubits, and the breadth of one curtain four cubits: the curtains were all of one size. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> And he coupled the five curtains one to another: and the other five curtains he coupled one to another. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain from the selvedge in the coupling: likewise he made in the extremity of another curtain, in the coupling of the second. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> Fifty loops he made in one curtain, and fifty loops he made in the edge of the curtain which was in the coupling of the second: the loops held one curtain to another. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> And he made fifty buttons of gold, and coupled the curtains one to another with the buttons. So it became one tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:14">36:14</a> And he made curtains of goats' hair for the tent over the tabernacle: eleven curtains he made them. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:15">36:15</a> The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four cubits was the breadth of one curtain: the eleven curtains were of one size. </p>

 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> And he made fifty loops upon the outermost edge of the curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he upon the edge of the curtain which coupleth the second. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:18">36:18</a> And he made fifty buttons of brass to couple the tent together, that it might be one. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:19">36:19</a> And he made a covering for the tent of rams' skins dyed red, and a covering of badgers' skins above that. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:20">36:20</a> And he made boards for the tabernacle of shittim wood, standing up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:21">36:21</a> The length of a board was ten cubits, and the breadth of a board one cubit and a half. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:22">36:22</a> One board had two tenons, equally distant one from another; thus did he make for all the boards of the tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:23">36:23</a> And he made boards for the tabernacle; twenty boards for the south side southward: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:24">36:24</a> And forty sockets of silver he made under the twenty boards; two sockets under one board for its two tenons, and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. </p>

 <p><a name="an_40:25">40:25</a> And he lighted the lamps before the LORD, as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:26">40:26</a> And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation, before the vail: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:27">40:27</a> And he burnt sweet incense on it; as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:28">40:28</a> And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:29">40:29</a> And he put the altar of burnt-offering by the door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon it the burnt-offering, and the meat-offering; as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:30">40:30</a> And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and the altar, and put water there, to wash with. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:31">40:31</a> And Moses, and Aaron, and his sons, washed their hands and their feet thereat: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:32">40:32</a> When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when they came near to the altar, they washed; as the LORD commanded Moses. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:33">40:33</a> And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the altar, and set up the hanging of the court-gate: so Moses finished the work. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:34">40:34</a> Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:35">40:35</a> And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the congregation, because the cloud abode upon it, and the glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:36">40:36</a> And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the children of Israel went onward in all their journeys: </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:37">40:37</a> But if the cloud was not taken up, then they journeyed not till the day that it was taken up. </p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:38">40:38</a> For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout all their journeys. </p>
