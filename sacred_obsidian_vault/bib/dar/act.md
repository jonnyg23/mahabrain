 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> I composed the first discourse, O Theophilus, concerning all  things which Jesus began both to do and to teach,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> until that day in which, having by the Holy Spirit charged  the apostles whom he had chosen, he was taken up;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> to whom also he presented himself living, after he had  suffered, with many proofs; being seen by them during forty  days, and speaking of the things which concern the kingdom of  God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> and, being assembled with [them], commanded them not to  depart from Jerusalem, but to await the promise of the Father,  which [said he] ye have heard of me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> For John indeed baptised with water, but *ye* shall be  baptised with the Holy Spirit after now not many days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> They therefore, being come together, asked him saying, Lord,  is it at this time that thou restorest the kingdom to Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And he said to them, It is not yours to know times or  seasons, which the Father has placed in his own authority;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> but ye will receive power, the Holy Spirit having come upon  you, and ye shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all  Judaea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And having said these things he was taken up, they beholding  [him], and a cloud received him out of their sight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And as they were gazing into heaven, as he was going,  behold, also two men stood by them in white clothing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> who also said, Men of Galilee, why do ye stand looking into  heaven? This Jesus who has been taken up from you into heaven,  shall thus come in the manner in which ye have beheld him going  into heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called [the  mount] of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a sabbath-day's  journey off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And when they were come into [the city], they went up to  the upper chamber, where were staying both Peter, and John, and  James, and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew,  James [son] of Alphaeus, and Simon the zealot, and Jude [the  brother] of James.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> These gave themselves all with one accord to continual  prayer, with [several] women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and  with his brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And in those days Peter, standing up in the midst of the  brethren, said, (the crowd of names [who were] together [was]  about a hundred and twenty,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> Brethren, it was necessary that the scripture should have  been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke before, by the  mouth of David, concerning Judas, who became guide to those who  took Jesus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> for he was numbered amongst us, and had received a part in  this service.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> (This [man] then indeed got a field with [the] reward of  iniquity, and, having fallen down headlong, burst in the midst,  and all his bowels gushed out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And it was known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so  that that field was called in their own dialect Aceldama; that  is, field of blood.)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> For it is written in [the] book of Psalms, Let his  homestead become desolate, and let there be no dweller in it;  and, Let another take his overseership.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> It is necessary therefore, that of the men who have  assembled with us all [the] time in which the Lord Jesus came  in and went out among us,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> beginning from the baptism of John until the day in which  he was taken up from us, one of these should be a witness with  us of his resurrection.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> And they appointed two, Joseph, who was called Barsabas,  who had been surnamed Justus, and Matthias.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> And they prayed, and said, Thou Lord, knower of the hearts  of all, shew which one of these two thou hast chosen,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> to receive the lot of this service and apostleship, from  which Judas transgressing fell to go to his own place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> And they gave lots on them, and the lot fell on Matthias,  and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And when the day of Pentecost was now accomplishing, they  were all together in one place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And there came suddenly a sound out of heaven as of a  violent impetuous blowing, and filled all the house where they  were sitting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And there appeared to them parted tongues, as of fire, and  it sat upon each one of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And they were all filled with [the] Holy Spirit, and began  to speak with other tongues as the Spirit gave to them to speak  forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, pious men, from  every nation of those under heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> But the rumour of this having spread, the multitude came  together and were confounded, because each one heard them  speaking in his own dialect.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And all were amazed and wondered, saying, Behold, are not  all these who are speaking Galilaeans?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and how do *we* hear [them] each in our own dialect in which  we have been born,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and those who inhabit  Mesopotamia, and Judaea, and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> both Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt, and the parts of Libya  which adjoin Cyrene, and the Romans sojourning [here], both  Jews and proselytes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Cretans and Arabians, we hear them speaking in our own  tongues the great things of God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And they were all amazed and in perplexity, saying one to  another, What would this mean?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> But others mocking said, They are full of new wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice  and spoke forth to them, Men of Judaea, and all ye inhabitants  of Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give heed to my  words:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> for these are not full of wine, as *ye* suppose, for it is  the third hour of the day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> but this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And it shall be in the last days, saith God, [that] I will  pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your  daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions,  and your elders shall dream with dreams;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> yea, even upon my bondmen and upon my bondwomen in those  days will I pour out of my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And I will give wonders in the heaven above and signs on  the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> the sun shall be changed to darkness and the moon to blood,  before the great and gloriously appearing day of [the] Lord  come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And it shall be that whosoever shall call upon the name of  [the] Lord shall be saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus the Nazaraean, a man  borne witness to by God to you by works of power and wonders  and signs, which God wrought by him in your midst, as  yourselves know</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> -- him, given up by the determinate counsel and  foreknowledge of God, ye, by [the] hand of lawless [men], have  crucified and slain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> Whom God has raised up, having loosed the pains of death,  inasmuch as it was not possible that he should be held by its  power;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> for David says as to him, I foresaw the Lord continually  before me, because he is at my right hand that I may not be  moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> Therefore has my heart rejoiced and my tongue exulted; yea  more, my flesh also shall dwell in hope,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> for thou wilt not leave my soul in hades, nor wilt thou  give thy gracious one to see corruption.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> Thou hast made known to me [the] paths of life, thou wilt  fill me with joy with thy countenance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> Brethren, let it be allowed to speak with freedom to you  concerning the patriarch David, that he has both died and been  buried, and his monument is amongst us unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn  to him with an oath, of the fruit of his loins to set upon his  throne;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> he, seeing [it] before, spoke concerning the resurrection  of the Christ, that neither has he been left in hades nor his  flesh seen corruption.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> This Jesus has God raised up, whereof all *we* are  witnesses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> Having therefore been exalted by the right hand of God, and  having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit,  he has poured out this which *ye* behold and hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> For David has not ascended into the heavens, but he says  himself, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> until I have put thine enemies [to be] the footstool of thy  feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> Let the whole house of Israel therefore know assuredly that  God has made him, this Jesus whom *ye* have crucified, both  Lord and Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> And having heard [it] they were pricked in heart, and said  to Peter and the other apostles, What shall we do, brethren?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:38">2:38</a> And Peter said to them, Repent, and be baptised, each one  of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for remission of sins, and  ye will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:39">2:39</a> For to you is the promise and to your children, and to all  who [are] afar off, as many as [the] Lord our God may call.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:40">2:40</a> And with many other words he testified and exhorted them,  saying, Be saved from this perverse generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:41">2:41</a> Those then who had accepted his word were baptised; and  there were added in that day about three thousand souls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:42">2:42</a> And they persevered in the teaching and fellowship of the  apostles, in breaking of bread and prayers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:43">2:43</a> And fear was upon every soul, and many wonders and signs  took place through the apostles' means.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:44">2:44</a> And all that believed were together, and had all things  common,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:45">2:45</a> and sold their possessions and substance, and distributed  them to all, according as any one might have need.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:46">2:46</a> And every day, being constantly in the temple with one  accord, and breaking bread in [the] house, they received their  food with gladness and simplicity of heart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:47">2:47</a> praising God, and having favour with all the people; and  the Lord added [to the assembly] daily those that were to be  saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Peter and John went up together into the temple at the  hour of prayer, [which is] the ninth [hour];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> and a certain man who was lame from his mother's womb was  being carried, whom they placed every day at the gate of the  temple called Beautiful, to ask alms of those who were going  into the temple;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> who, seeing Peter and John about to enter into the temple,  asked to receive alms.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And Peter, looking stedfastly upon him with John, said, Look  on us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And he gave heed to them, expecting to receive something  from them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> But Peter said, Silver and gold I have not; but what I have,  this give I to thee: In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean  rise up and walk.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And having taken hold of him [by] the right hand he raised  him up, and immediately his feet and ankle bones were made  strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And leaping up he stood and walked, and entered with them  into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And all the people saw him walking and praising God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> and they recognised him, that it was *he* who sat for alms  at the Beautiful gate of the temple; and they were filled with  wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together  to them in the portico which is called Solomon's, greatly  wondering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And Peter, seeing it, answered the people, Men of Israel,  why are ye astonished at this? or why do ye gaze on us as if we  had by our own power or piety made him to walk?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> The God of Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, the God of our  fathers, has glorified his servant Jesus, whom *ye* delivered  up, and denied him in the presence of Pilate, when *he* had  judged that he should be let go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> But *ye* denied the holy and righteous one, and asked that  a man [that was] a murderer should be granted to you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> but the originator of life ye slew, whom God raised from  among [the] dead, whereof *we* are witnesses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And, by faith in his name, his name has made this [man]  strong whom ye behold and know; and the faith which is by him  has given him this complete soundness in the presence of you  all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> And now, brethren, I know that ye did it in ignorance, as  also your rulers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> but God has thus fulfilled what he had announced beforehand  by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ should  suffer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Repent therefore and be converted, for the blotting out of  your sins, so that times of refreshing may come from [the]  presence of the Lord,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> and he may send Jesus Christ, who was foreordained for you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> whom heaven indeed must receive till [the] times of [the]  restoring of all things, of which God has spoken by the mouth  of his holy prophets since time began.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> Moses indeed said, A prophet shall [the] Lord your God  raise up to you out of your brethren like me: him shall ye hear  in everything whatsoever he shall say to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> And it shall be that whatsoever soul shall not hear that  prophet shall be destroyed from among the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> And indeed all the prophets from Samuel and those in  succession after [him], as many as have spoken, have announced  also these days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> *Ye* are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant which  God appointed to our fathers, saying to Abraham, And in thy  seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> To you first God, having raised up his servant, has sent  him, blessing you in turning each one [of you] from your  wickedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and  captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> being distressed on account of their teaching the people and  preaching by Jesus the resurrection from among [the] dead;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and they laid hands on them, and put them in ward till the  morrow; for it was already evening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> But many of those who had heard the word believed; and the  number of the men had become [about] five thousand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And it came to pass on the morrow that their rulers and  elders and scribes were gathered together at Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> and Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and  Alexander, and as many as were of [the] high priestly family;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> and having placed them in the midst they inquired, In what  power or in what name have *ye* done this?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> Then Peter, filled with [the] Holy Spirit, said to them,  Rulers of the people and elders [of Israel],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> if *we* this day are called upon to answer as to the good  deed [done] to the infirm man, how *he* has been healed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> be it known to you all, and to all the people of Israel,  that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazaraean, whom *ye* have  crucified, whom God has raised from among [the] dead, by *him*  this [man] stands here before you sound [in body].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> *He* is the stone which has been set at nought by you the  builders, which is become the corner stone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And salvation is in none other, for neither is there  another name under heaven which is given among men by which we  must be saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> But seeing the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving  that they were unlettered and uninstructed men, they wondered;  and they recognised them that they were with Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And beholding the man who had been healed standing with  them, they had nothing to reply;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> but having commanded them to go out of the council they  conferred with one another,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed an  evident sign has come to pass through their means is manifest  to all that inhabit Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> But that it be not further spread among the people, let us  threaten them severely no longer to speak to any man in this  name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And having called them, they charged [them] not to speak at  all nor teach in the name of Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> But Peter and John answering said to them, If it be  righteous before God to listen to you rather than to God, judge  ye;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> for as for us *we* cannot refrain from speaking of the  things which we have seen and heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> But they, having further threatened them, let them go,  finding no way how they might punish them, on account of the  people, because all glorified God for what had taken place;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> for the man on whom this sign of healing had taken place  was above forty years old.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And having been let go, they came to their own [company],  and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said to  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> And they, having heard [it], lifted up [their] voice with  one accord to God, and said, Lord, *thou* art the God who made  the heaven and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> who hast said by the mouth of thy servant David, Why have  [the] nations raged haughtily and [the] peoples meditated vain  things?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> The kings of the earth were there, and the rulers were  gathered together against the Lord and against his Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> For in truth against thy holy servant Jesus, whom thou  hadst anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, with [the]  nations, and peoples of Israel, have been gathered together in  this city</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> to do whatever thy hand and thy counsel had determined  before should come to pass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> And now, Lord, look upon their threatenings, and give to  thy bondmen with all boldness to speak thy word,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> in that thou stretchest out thy hand to heal, and that  signs and wonders take place through the name of thy holy  servant Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> And when they had prayed, the place in which they were  assembled shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit,  and spoke the word of God with boldness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:32">4:32</a> And the heart and soul of the multitude of those that had  believed were one, and not one said that anything of what he  possessed was his own, but all things were common to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:33">4:33</a> and with great power did the apostles give witness of the  resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them  all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:34">4:34</a> For neither was there any one in want among them; for as  many as were owners of lands or houses, selling them, brought  the price of what was sold</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:35">4:35</a> and laid it at the feet of the apostles; and distribution  was made to each according as any one might have need.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:36">4:36</a> And Joseph, who had been surnamed Barnabas by the apostles  (which is, being interpreted, Son of consolation), a Levite,  Cyprian by birth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:37">4:37</a> being possessed of land, having sold [it], brought the  money and laid it at the feet of the apostles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> But a certain man, Ananias by name, with Sapphira his wife,  sold a possession,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> and put aside for himself part of the price, [his] wife also  being privy to it; and having brought a certain part, laid it  at the feet of the apostles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled thy heart that  thou shouldest lie to the Holy Spirit, and put aside for  thyself a part of the price of the estate?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> While it remained did it not remain to *thee*? and sold, was  [it not] in thine own power? Why is it that thou hast purposed  this thing in thine heart? Thou hast not lied to men, but to  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And Ananias, hearing these words, fell down and expired. And  great fear came upon all who heard [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And the young men, rising up, swathed him up for burial, and  having carried him out, buried him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And it came to pass about three hours afterwards, that his  wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And Peter answered her, Tell me if ye gave the estate for so  much? And she said, Yes, for so much.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And Peter said to her, Why [is it] that ye have agreed  together to tempt the Spirit of [the] Lord? Lo, the feet of  those that have buried thy husband [are] at the door, and they  shall carry thee out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And she fell down immediately at his feet and expired. And  when the young men came in they found her dead; and, having  carried her out, they buried her by her husband.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And great fear came upon all the assembly, and upon all who  heard these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and  wonders done among the people; (and they were all with one  accord in Solomon's porch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> but of the rest durst no man join them, but the people  magnified them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> and believers were more than ever added to the Lord,  multitudes both of men and women;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> so that they brought out the sick into the streets and put  [them] on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter,  when he came, might overshadow some one of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> And the multitude also of the cities round about came  together to Jerusalem, bringing sick persons and persons beset  by unclean spirits, who were all healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And the high priest rising up, and all they that were with  him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, were filled with  wrath,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> and laid hands on the apostles and put them in the public  prison.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> But an angel of [the] Lord during the night opened the  doors of the prison, and leading them out, said,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> Go ye and stand and speak in the temple to the people all  the words of this life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> And when they heard it, they entered very early into the  temple and taught. And when the high priest was come, and they  that were with him, they called together the council and all  the elderhood of the sons of Israel, and sent to the prison to  have them brought.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> And when the officers were come, they did not find them in  the prison; and returned and reported</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> saying, We found the prison shut with all security, and the  keepers standing at the doors; but when we had opened [them],  within we found no one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> And when they heard these words, both the priest and the  captain of the temple and the chief priests were in perplexity  as to them, what this would come to.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> And some one coming reported to them, Lo, the men whom ye  put in the prison are in the temple, standing and teaching the  people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> Then the captain, having gone with the officers, brought  them, not with violence, for they feared the people, lest they  should be stoned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> And they bring them and set them in the council. And the  high priest asked them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> saying, We strictly enjoined you not to teach in this name:  and lo, ye have filled Jerusalem with your doctrine, and  purpose to bring upon us the blood of this man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> But Peter answering, and the apostles, said, God must be  obeyed rather than men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> The God of our fathers has raised up Jesus, whom *ye* have  slain, having hanged on a cross.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> Him has God exalted by his right hand as leader and  saviour, to give repentance to Israel and remission of sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:32">5:32</a> And *we* are [his] witnesses of these things, and the Holy  Spirit also, which God has given to those that obey him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:33">5:33</a> But they, when they heard [these things], were cut to the  heart, and took counsel to kill them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:34">5:34</a> But a certain [man], a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher  of the law, held in honour of all the people, rose up in the  council, and commanded to put the men out for a short while,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:35">5:35</a> and said to them, Men of Israel, take heed to yourselves as  regards these men what ye are going to do;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:36">5:36</a> for before these days Theudas rose up, alleging himself to  be somebody, to whom a number of men, about four hundred, were  joined; who was slain, and all, as many as obeyed him, were  dispersed and came to nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:37">5:37</a> After him rose Judas the Galilean in the days of the  census, and drew away [a number of] people after him; and *he*  perished, and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered  abroad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:38">5:38</a> And now I say to you, Withdraw from these men and let them  alone, for if this counsel or this work have its origin from  men, it will be destroyed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:39">5:39</a> but if it be from God, ye will not be able to put them  down, lest ye be found also fighters against God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:40">5:40</a> And they listened to his advice; and having called the  apostles, they beat them, and enjoined them not to speak in the  name of Jesus, and dismissed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:41">5:41</a> They therefore went their way from [the] presence of the  council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be  dishonoured for the name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:42">5:42</a> And every day, in the temple and in the houses, they ceased  not teaching and announcing the glad tidings that Jesus [was]  the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> But in those days, the disciples multiplying in number,  there arose a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews  because their widows were overlooked in the daily ministration.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And the twelve, having called the multitude of the disciples  to [them], said, It is not right that we, leaving the word of  God, should serve tables.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Look out therefore, brethren, from among yourselves seven  men, well reported of, full of [the] [Holy] Spirit and wisdom,  whom we will establish over this business:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> but *we* will give ourselves up to prayer and the ministry  of the word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose  Stephen, a man full of faith and [the] Holy Spirit, and Philip,  and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and  Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> whom they set before the apostles; and, having prayed, they  laid their hands on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And the word of God increased; and the number of the  disciples in Jerusalem was very greatly multiplied, and a great  crowd of the priests obeyed the faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And Stephen, full of grace and power, wrought wonders and  great signs among the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And there arose up certain of those of the synagogue called  of freedmen, and of Cyrenians, and of Alexandrians, and of  those of Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit  with which he spoke.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> Then they suborned men, saying, We have heard him speaking  blasphemous words against Moses and God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And they roused the people, and the elders, and the  scribes. And coming upon [him] they seized him and brought  [him] to the council.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> And they set false witnesses, saying, This man does not  cease speaking words against the holy place and the law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> for we have heard him saying, This Jesus the Nazaraean  shall destroy this place, and change the customs which Moses  taught us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And all who sat in the council, looking fixedly on him, saw  his face as [the] face of an angel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And the high priest said, Are these things then so?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And he said, Brethren and fathers, hearken. The God of glory  appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia,  before he dwelt in Charran,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> and said to him, Go out of thy land and out of thy kindred,  and come into the land which I will shew thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> Then going out of the land of the Chaldeans he dwelt in  Charran, and thence, after his father died, he removed him into  this land in which *ye* now dwell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> And he did not give him an inheritance in it, not even what  his foot could stand on; and promised to give it to him for a  possession, and to his seed after him, when he had no child.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And God spoke thus: His seed shall be a sojourner in a  strange land, and they shall enslave them and evil entreat  [them] four hundred years;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> and the nation to which they shall be in bondage will *I*  judge, said God; and after these things they shall come forth  and serve me in this place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And he gave to him [the] covenant of circumcision; and thus  he begat Isaac and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac  Jacob, and Jacob the twelve patriarchs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> And the patriarchs, envying Joseph, sold him away into  Egypt. And God was with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> and delivered him out of all his tribulations, and gave him  favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he  appointed him chief over Egypt and all his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> But a famine came upon all the land of Egypt and Canaan,  and great distress, and our fathers found no food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> But Jacob, having heard of there being corn in Egypt, sent  out our fathers first;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> and the second time Joseph was made known to his brethren,  and the family of Joseph became known to Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And Joseph sent and called down to him his father Jacob and  all [his] kindred, seventy-five souls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> And Jacob went down into Egypt and died, he and our  fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> and were carried over to Sychem and placed in the sepulchre  which Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Emmor  the [father] of Sychem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> But as the time of promise drew near which God had promised  to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> until another king over Egypt arose who did not know  Joseph.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> *He* dealt subtilly with our race, and evil entreated the  fathers, casting out their infants that they might not live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> In which time Moses was born, and was exceedingly lovely,  who was nourished three months in the house of his father.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And when he was cast out, the daughter of Pharaoh took him  up, and brought him up for herself [to be] for a son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> And Moses was instructed in all [the] wisdom of the  Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And when a period of forty years was fulfilled to him, it  came into his heart to look upon his brethren, the sons of  Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> and seeing a certain one wronged, he defended [him], and  avenged him that was being oppressed, smiting the Egyptian.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> For he thought that his brethren would understand that God  by his hand was giving them deliverance. But they understood  not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> And on the morrow he shewed himself to them as they were  contending, and compelled them to peace, saying, *Ye* are  brethren, why do ye wrong one another?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> But he that was wronging his neighbour thrust him away,  saying, Who established thee ruler and judge over us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:28">7:28</a> Dost *thou* wish to kill me as thou killedst the Egyptian  yesterday?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:29">7:29</a> And Moses fled at this saying, and became a sojourner in  the land of Madiam, where he begat two sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:30">7:30</a> And when forty years were fulfilled, an angel appeared to  him in the wilderness of mount Sinai, in a flame of fire of a  bush.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:31">7:31</a> And Moses seeing it wondered at the vision; and as he went  up to consider it, there was a voice of [the] Lord,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:32">7:32</a> *I* am the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of  Isaac, and of Jacob. And Moses trembled, and durst not consider  [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:33">7:33</a> And the Lord said to him, Loose the sandal of thy feet, for  the place on which thou standest is holy ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:34">7:34</a> I have surely seen the ill treatment of my people which is  in Egypt, and I have heard their groan, and have come down to  take them out of it; and now, come, I will send thee to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:35">7:35</a> This Moses, whom they refused, saying, Who made thee ruler  and judge? him did God send [to be] a ruler and deliverer with  the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:36">7:36</a> *He* led them out, having wrought wonders and signs in the  land of Egypt, and in the Red sea, and in the wilderness forty  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:37">7:37</a> This is the Moses who said to the sons of Israel, A prophet  shall God raise up to you out of your brethren like me [him  shall ye hear].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:38">7:38</a> This is he who was in the assembly in the wilderness, with  the angel who spoke to him in the mount Sinai, and with our  fathers; who received living oracles to give to us;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:39">7:39</a> to whom our fathers would not be subject, but thrust [him]  from them, and in their hearts turned back to Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:40">7:40</a> saying to Aaron, Make us gods who shall go before us; for  this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know  not what has happened to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:41">7:41</a> And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice  to the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:42">7:42</a> But God turned and delivered them up to serve the host of  heaven; as it is written in [the] book of the prophets, Have ye  offered me victims and sacrifices forty years in the  wilderness, O house of Israel?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:43">7:43</a> Yea, ye took up the tent of Moloch, and the star of [your]  god Remphan, the forms which ye made to do homage to them; and  I will transport you beyond Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:44">7:44</a> Our fathers had the tent of the testimony in the  wilderness, as he that spoke to Moses commanded to make it  according to the model which he had seen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:45">7:45</a> which also our fathers, receiving from their predecessors,  brought in with Joshua when they entered into possession of  [the lands of] the nations, whom God drove out from [the] face  of our fathers, until the days of David;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:46">7:46</a> who found favour before God, and asked to find a tabernacle  for the God of Jacob;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:47">7:47</a> but Solomon built him a house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:48">7:48</a> But the Most High dwells not in [places] made with hands;  as says the prophet,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:49">7:49</a> The heaven [is] my throne and the earth the footstool of my  feet: what house will ye build me? saith [the] Lord, or where  [is the] place of my rest?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:50">7:50</a> has not my hand made all these things?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:51">7:51</a> O stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, *ye* do  always resist the Holy Spirit; as your fathers, *ye* also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:52">7:52</a> Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and  they have slain those who announced beforehand concerning the  coming of the Just One, of whom *ye* have now become deliverers  up and murderers!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:53">7:53</a> who have received the law as ordained by [the] ministry of  angels, and have not kept [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:54">7:54</a> And hearing these things they were cut to the heart, and  gnashed their teeth against him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:55">7:55</a> But being full of [the] Holy Spirit, having fixed his eyes  on heaven, he saw [the] glory of God, and Jesus standing at the  right hand of God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:56">7:56</a> and said, Lo, I behold the heavens opened, and the Son of  man standing at the right hand of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:57">7:57</a> And they cried out with a loud voice, and held their ears,  and rushed upon him with one accord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:58">7:58</a> and having cast [him] out of the city, they stoned [him].  And the witnesses laid aside their clothes at the feet of a  young man called Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:59">7:59</a> And they stoned Stephen, praying, and saying, Lord Jesus,  receive my spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:60">7:60</a> And kneeling down, he cried with a loud voice, Lord, lay  not this sin to their charge. And having said this, he fell  asleep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And Saul was consenting to his being killed. And on that day  there arose a great persecution against the assembly which was  in Jerusalem, and all were scattered into the countries of  Judaea and Samaria except the apostles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And pious men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> But Saul ravaged the assembly, entering into the houses one  after another, and dragging off both men and women delivered  them up to prison.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> Those then that had been scattered went through [the  countries] announcing the glad tidings of the word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And Philip, going down to a city of Samaria, preached the  Christ to them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> and the crowds with one accord gave heed to the things  spoken by Philip, when they heard [him] and saw the signs which  he wrought.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> For from many who had unclean spirits they went out, crying  with a loud voice; and many that were paralysed and lame were  healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And there was great joy in that city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> But a certain man, by name Simon, had been before in the  city, using magic arts, and astonishing the nation of Samaria,  saying that himself was some great one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> To whom they had all given heed, from small to great,  saying, This is the power of God which is called great.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And they gave heed to him, because that for a long time he  had astonished them by his magic arts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> But when they believed Philip announcing the glad tidings  concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ,  they were baptised, both men and women.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And Simon also himself believed; and, having been baptised,  continued constantly with Philip; and, beholding the signs and  great works of power which took place, was astonished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And the apostles who were in Jerusalem, having heard that  Samaria had received the word of God, sent to them Peter and  John;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> who, having come down, prayed for them that they might  receive [the] Holy Spirit;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> for he was not yet fallen upon any of them, only they were  baptised to the name of the Lord Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> Then they laid their hands upon them, and they received  [the] Holy Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> But Simon, having seen that by the laying on of the hands  of the apostles the [Holy] Spirit was given, offered them  money,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> saying, Give to me also this power, in order that on  whomsoever I may lay hands he may receive [the] Holy Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> And Peter said to him, Thy money go with thee to  destruction, because thou hast thought that the gift of God can  be obtained by money.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter, for thy  heart is not upright before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and supplicate the  Lord, if indeed the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> for I see thee to be in the gall of bitterness, and bond of  unrighteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> And Simon answering said, Supplicate *ye* for me to the  Lord, so that nothing may come upon me of the things of which  ye have spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> They therefore, having testified and spoken the word of the  Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and announced the glad tidings to  many villages of the Samaritans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> But [the] angel of [the] Lord spoke to Philip, saying, Rise  up and go southward on the way which goes down from Jerusalem  to Gaza: the same is desert.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> And he rose up and went. And lo, an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a  man in power under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who was  over all her treasure, who had come to worship at Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> was returning and sitting in his chariot: and he was  reading the prophet Esaias.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> And the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this  chariot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> And Philip, running up, heard him reading the prophet  Esaias, and said, Dost thou then know what thou art reading of?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> And he said, How should I then be able unless some one  guide me? And he begged Philip to come up and sit with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> And the passage of the scripture which he read was this: He  was led as a sheep to slaughter, and as a lamb is dumb in  presence of him that shears him, thus he opens not his mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:33">8:33</a> In his humiliation his judgment has been taken away, and  who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:34">8:34</a> And the eunuch answering Philip said, I pray thee,  concerning whom does the prophet say this? of himself or of  some other?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:35">8:35</a> And Philip, opening his mouth and beginning from that  scripture, announced the glad tidings of Jesus to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:36">8:36</a> And as they went along the way, they came upon a certain  water, and the eunuch says, Behold water; what hinders my being  baptised?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:37">8:37</a>  </p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:38">8:38</a> And he commanded the chariot to stop. And they went down  both to the water, both Philip and the eunuch, and he baptised  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:39">8:39</a> But when they came up out of the water [the] Spirit of  [the] Lord caught away Philip, and the eunuch saw him no  longer, for he went on his way rejoicing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:40">8:40</a> And Philip was found at Azotus, and passing through he  announced the glad tidings to all the cities till he came to  Caesarea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> But Saul, still breathing out threatenings and slaughter  against the disciples of the Lord, came to the high priest</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> and asked of him letters to Damascus, to the synagogues, so  that if he found any who were of the way, both men and women,  he might bring [them] bound to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> But as he was journeying, it came to pass that he drew near  to Damascus; and suddenly there shone round about him a light  out of heaven,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> and falling on the earth he heard a voice saying to him,  Saul, Saul, why dost thou persecute me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he [said], *I* am  Jesus, whom *thou* persecutest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> But rise up and enter into the city, and it shall be told  thee what thou must do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> But the men who were travelling with him stood speechless,  hearing the voice but beholding no one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And Saul rose up from the earth, and his eyes being opened  he saw no one. But leading [him] by the hand they brought him  into Damascus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And he was three days without seeing, and neither ate nor  drank.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And there was a certain disciple in Damascus by name  Ananias. And the Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he  said, Behold, [here am] I, Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And the Lord [said] to him, Rise up and go into the street  which is called Straight, and seek in the house of Judas one by  name Saul, [he is] of Tarsus: for, behold, he is praying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> and has seen [in a vision] a man by name Ananias coming in  and putting his hand on him, so that he should see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many  concerning this man how much evil he has done to thy saints at  Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> and here he has authority from the chief priests to bind  all who call upon thy name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> And the Lord said to him, Go, for this [man] is an elect  vessel to me, to bear my name before both nations and kings and  [the] sons of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> for *I* will shew to him how much he must suffer for my  name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> And Ananias went and entered into the house; and laying his  hands upon him he said, Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me,  Jesus that appeared to thee in the way in which thou camest,  that thou mightest see, and be filled with [the] Holy Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> And straightway there fell from his eyes as it were scales,  and he saw, and rising up was baptised;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> and, having received food, got strength. And he was with  the disciples who [were] in Damascus certain days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> And straightway in the synagogues he preached Jesus that  *he* is the Son of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> And all who heard were astonished and said, Is not this  *he* who destroyed in Jerusalem those who called on this name,  and here was come for this purpose, that he might bring them  bound to the chief priests?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> But Saul increased the more in power, and confounded the  Jews who dwelt in Damascus, proving that this is the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> Now when many days were fulfilled, the Jews consulted  together to kill him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched also  the gates both day and night, that they might kill him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> but the disciples took him by night and let him down  through the wall, lowering him in a basket.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> And having arrived at Jerusalem he essayed to join himself  to the disciples, and all were afraid of him, not believing  that he was a disciple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles, and  related to them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that  he had spoken to him, and how in Damascus he had spoken boldly  in the name of Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> and speaking boldly in the name of the Lord. And he spoke  and discussed with the Hellenists; but they sought to kill him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> And the brethren knowing it, brought him down to Caesarea  and sent him away to Tarsus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> The assemblies then throughout the whole of Judaea and  Galilee and Samaria had peace, being edified and walking in the  fear of the Lord, and were increased through the comfort of the  Holy Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:32">9:32</a> Now it came to pass that Peter, passing through all  [quarters], descended also to the saints who inhabited Lydda.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:33">9:33</a> And he found there a certain man, Aeneas by name, who had  been lying for eight years upon a couch, who was paralysed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:34">9:34</a> And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus, the Christ, heals  thee: rise up, and make thy couch for thyself. And straightway  he rose up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:35">9:35</a> And all who inhabited Lydda and the Saron saw him, who  turned to the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:36">9:36</a> And in Joppa there was a certain female disciple, by name  Tabitha, which being interpreted means Dorcas. She was full of  good works and alms-deeds which she did.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:37">9:37</a> And it came to pass in those days that she grew sick and  died; and, having washed her, they put her in [the] upper room.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:38">9:38</a> But Lydda being near to Joppa, the disciples having heard  that Peter was there, sent two men to him, beseeching him, Thou  must not delay coming to us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:39">9:39</a> And Peter rising up went with them, whom, when arrived,  they brought up into the upper chamber; and all the widows  stood by him weeping and shewing him the body-coats and  garments which Dorcas had made while she was with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:40">9:40</a> But Peter, putting them all out, and kneeling down, prayed.  And, turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she  opened her eyes, and, seeing Peter, sat up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:41">9:41</a> And having given her [his] hand, he raised her up, and  having called the saints and the widows, presented her living.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:42">9:42</a> And it became known throughout the whole of Joppa, and many  believed on the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:43">9:43</a> And it came to pass that he remained many days in Joppa  with a certain Simon, a tanner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> But a certain man in Caesarea, -- by name Cornelius, a  centurion of the band called Italic,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> pious, and fearing God with all his house, [both] giving  much alms to the people, and supplicating God continually,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> -- saw plainly in a vision, about the ninth hour of the  day, an angel of God coming unto him, and saying to him,  Cornelius.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> But he, having fixed his eyes upon him, and become full of  fear, said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Thy prayers  and thine alms have gone up for a memorial before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And now send men to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed  Peter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> He lodges with a certain Simon, a tanner, whose house is by  the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And when the angel who was speaking to him had departed,  having called two of his household and a pious soldier of those  who were constantly with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> and related all things to them, he sent them to Joppa.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And on the morrow, as these were journeying and drawing  near to the city, Peter went up on the house to pray, about the  sixth hour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And he became hungry and desired to eat. But as they were  making ready an ecstasy came upon him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> and he beholds the heaven opened, and a certain vessel  descending, as a great sheet, [bound] by [the] four corners  [and] let down to the earth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> in which were all the quadrupeds and creeping things of  the earth, and the fowls of the heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And there was a voice to him, Rise, Peter, slay and eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And Peter said, In no wise, Lord; for I have never eaten  anything common or unclean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And [there was] a voice again the second time to him, What  God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And this took place thrice, and the vessel was straightway  taken up into heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And as Peter doubted in himself what the vision which he  had seen might mean, behold also the men who were sent by  Cornelius, having sought out the house of Simon, stood at the  gate,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> and having called [some one], they inquired if Simon who  was surnamed Peter was lodged there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> But as Peter continued pondering over the vision, the  Spirit said to him, Behold, three men seek thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> but rise up, go down, and go with them, nothing doubting,  because *I* have sent them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> And Peter going down to the men said, Behold, *I* am he  whom ye seek: what is the cause for which ye come?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, a righteous man,  and fearing God, and borne witness to by the whole nation of  the Jews, has been divinely instructed by a holy angel to send  for thee to his house, and hear words from thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> Having therefore invited them in, he lodged them. And on  the morrow, rising up he went away with them, and certain of  the brethren from Joppa went with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> And on the morrow they came to Caesarea. But Cornelius was  looking for them, having called together his kinsmen and [his]  intimate friends.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> And when Peter was now coming in, Cornelius met him, and  falling down did [him] homage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> But Peter made him rise, saying, Rise up: *I* myself also  am a man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> And he went in, talking with him, and found many gathered  together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> And he said to them, *Ye* know how it is unlawful for a  Jew to be joined or come to one of a strange race, and to *me*  God has shewn to call no man common or unclean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> Wherefore also, having been sent for, I came without  saying anything against it. I inquire therefore for what reason  ye have sent for me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:30">10:30</a> And Cornelius said, Four days ago I had been [fasting]  unto this hour, and the ninth [I was] praying in my house, and  lo, a man stood before me in bright clothing,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:31">10:31</a> and said, Cornelius, thy prayer has been heard, and thy  alms have come in remembrance before God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:32">10:32</a> Send therefore to Joppa and fetch Simon, who is surnamed  Peter; he lodges in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea  [who when he is come will speak to thee].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:33">10:33</a> Immediately therefore I sent to thee, and *thou* hast well  done in coming. Now therefore *we* are all present before God  to hear all things that are commanded thee of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:34">10:34</a> And Peter opening his mouth said, Of a truth I perceive  that God is no respecter of persons,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:35">10:35</a> but in every nation he that fears him and works  righteousness is acceptable to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:36">10:36</a> The word which he sent to the sons of Israel, preaching  peace by Jesus Christ, (*he* is Lord of all things,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:37">10:37</a> *ye* know; the testimony which has spread through the  whole of Judaea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism which  John preached --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:38">10:38</a> Jesus who [was] of Nazareth: how God anointed him with  [the] Holy Spirit and with power; who went through [all  quarters] doing good, and healing all that were under the power  of the devil, because God was with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:39">10:39</a> *We* also [are] witnesses of all things which he did both  in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem; whom they also  slew, having hanged him on a cross.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:40">10:40</a> This [man] God raised up the third day and gave him to be  openly seen,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:41">10:41</a> not of all the people, but of witnesses who were chosen  before of God, *us* who have eaten and drunk with him after he  arose from among [the] dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:42">10:42</a> And he commanded us to preach to the people, and to  testify that *he* it is who was determinately appointed of God  [to be] judge of living and dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:43">10:43</a> To him all the prophets bear witness that every one that  believes on him will receive through his name remission of  sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:44">10:44</a> While Peter was yet speaking these words the Holy Spirit  fell upon all those who were hearing the word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:45">10:45</a> And the faithful of the circumcision were astonished, as  many as came with Peter, that upon the nations also the gift of  the Holy Spirit was poured out:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:46">10:46</a> for they heard them speaking with tongues and magnifying  God. Then Peter answered,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:47">10:47</a> Can any one forbid water that these should not be  baptised, who have received the Holy Spirit as we also [did]?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:48">10:48</a> And he commanded them to be baptised in the name of the  Lord. Then they begged him to stay some days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And the apostles and the brethren who were in Judaea heard  that the nations also had received the word of God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> and when Peter went up to Jerusalem, they of the  circumcision contended with him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised and hast eaten  with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> But Peter began and set forth [the matter] to them in  order, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in an ecstasy I saw  a vision, a certain vessel descending like a great sheet, let  down by four corners out of heaven, and it came even to me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> on which having fixed mine eyes, I considered, and saw the  quadrupeds of the earth, and the wild beasts, and the creeping  things, and the fowls of the heaven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> And I heard also a voice saying to me, Rise up, Peter, slay  and eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And I said, In no wise, Lord, for common or unclean has  never entered into my mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And a voice answered the second time out of heaven, What  God has cleansed, do not *thou* make common.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And this took place thrice, and again all was drawn up  into heaven;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> and lo, immediately three men were at the house in which I  was, sent to me from Caesarea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And the Spirit said to me to go with them, nothing  doubting. And there went with me these six brethren also, and  we entered into the house of the man,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> and he related to us how he had seen the angel in his  house, standing and saying [to him], Send [men] to Joppa and  fetch Simon, who is surnamed Peter,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> who shall speak words to thee whereby *thou* shalt be  saved, thou and all thy house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell upon them  even as upon us also at the beginning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John  baptised with water, but *ye* shall be baptised with [the] Holy  Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> If then God has given them the same gift as also to us  when we had believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who indeed was  *I* to be able to forbid God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And when they heard these things they held their peace,  and glorified God, saying, Then indeed God has to the nations  also granted repentance to life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> They then who had been scattered abroad through the  tribulation that took place on the occasion of Stephen, passed  through [the country] to Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch,  speaking the word to no one but to Jews alone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> But there were certain of them, Cyprians and Cyrenians,  who entering into Antioch spoke to the Greeks also, announcing  the glad tidings of the Lord Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> And [the] Lord's hand was with them, and a great number  believed and turned to the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> And the report concerning them reached the ears of the  assembly which was in Jerusalem, and they sent out Barnabas to  go through as far as Antioch:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> who, having arrived and seeing the grace of God, rejoiced,  and exhorted all with purpose of heart to abide with the Lord;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:24">11:24</a> for he was a good man and full of [the] Holy Spirit and of  faith; and a large crowd [of people] were added to the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:25">11:25</a> And he went away to Tarsus to seek out Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:26">11:26</a> And having found [him], he brought him to Antioch. And so  it was with them that for a whole year they were gathered  together in the assembly and taught a large crowd: and the  disciples were first called Christians in Antioch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:27">11:27</a> Now in these days prophets went down from Jerusalem to  Antioch;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:28">11:28</a> and one from among them, by name Agabus, rose up and  signified by the Spirit that there was going to be a great  famine over all the inhabited earth, which also came to pass  under Claudius.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:29">11:29</a> And they determined, according as any one of the disciples  was well off, each of them to send to the brethren who dwelt in  Judaea, to minister [to them];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:30">11:30</a> which also they did, sending it to the elders by the hand  of Barnabas and Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> At that time Herod the king laid his hands on some of those  of the assembly to do them hurt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> and slew James, the brother of John, with the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> And seeing that it was pleasing to the Jews, he went on to  take Peter also: (and they were the days of unleavened bread:)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> whom having seized he put in prison, having delivered him  to four quaternions of soldiers to keep, purposing after the  passover to bring him out to the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Peter therefore was kept in the prison; but unceasing  prayer was made by the assembly to God concerning him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And when Herod was going to bring him forth, that night  Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains,  and guards before the door kept the prison.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And lo, an angel of [the] Lord came there, and a light  shone in the prison: and having smitten the side of Peter, he  roused him up, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off  his hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> And the angel said to him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy  sandals. And he did so. And he says to him, Cast thine upper  garment about thee and follow me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And going forth he followed [him] and did not know that  what was happening by means of the angel was real, but supposed  he saw a vision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And having passed through a first and second guard, they  came to the iron gate which leads into the city, which opened  to them of itself; and going forth they went down one street,  and immediately the angel left him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> And Peter, being come to himself, said, Now I know  certainly that [the] Lord has sent forth his angel and has  taken me out of the hand of Herod and all the expectation of  the people of the Jews.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> And having become clearly conscious [in himself], he came  to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was surnamed Mark,  where were many gathered together and praying.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And when he had knocked at the door of the entry, a maid  came to listen, by name Rhoda;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> and having recognised the voice of Peter, through joy did  not open the entry, but running in, reported that Peter was  standing before the entry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And they said to her, Thou art mad. But she maintained  that it was so. And they said, It is his angel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> But Peter continued knocking: and having opened, they saw  him and were astonished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And having made a sign to them with his hand to be silent,  he related [to them] how the Lord had brought him out of  prison; and he said, Report these things to James and to the  brethren. And he went out and went to another place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> And when it was day there was no small disturbance among  the soldiers, what then was become of Peter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:19">12:19</a> And Herod having sought him and not found him, having  examined the guards, commanded [them] to be executed. And he  went down from Judaea to Caesarea and stayed [there].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> And he was in bitter hostility with [the] Tyrians and  Sidonians; but they came to him with one accord, and, having  gained Blastus the king's chamberlain, sought peace, because  their country was nourished by the king's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> And on a set day, clothed in royal apparel and sitting on  the elevated seat [of honour], Herod made a public oration to  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> And the people cried out, A god's voice and not a man's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> And immediately an angel of [the] Lord smote him, because  he did not give the glory to God, and he expired, eaten of  worms.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> But the word of God grew and spread itself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, having  fulfilled the service [entrusted to them], taking also with  them John, surnamed Mark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> Now there were in Antioch, in the assembly which was  [there], prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon who was  called Niger, and Lucius the Cyrenian, and Manaen,  foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the  Holy Spirit said, Separate me now Barnabas and Saul for the  work to which I have called them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> Then, having fasted and prayed, and having laid [their]  hands on them, they let [them] go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> They therefore, having been sent forth by the Holy Spirit,  went down to Seleucia, and thence sailed away to Cyprus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And being in Salamis, they announced the word of God in the  synagogues of the Jews. And they had John also as [their]  attendant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And having passed through the whole island as far as  Paphos, they found a certain man a magician, a false prophet, a  Jew, whose name was Bar-jesus,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> who was with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, an intelligent  man. *He*, having called Barnabas and Saul to [him], desired to  hear the word of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> But Elymas the magician (for so his name is by  interpretation) opposed them, seeking to turn away the  proconsul from the faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> But Saul, who also [is] Paul, filled with [the] Holy  Spirit, fixing his eyes upon him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> said, O full of all deceit and all craft: son of [the]  devil, enemy of all righteousness; wilt thou not cease  perverting the right paths of [the] Lord?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> And now behold, [the] Lord's hand [is] upon thee, and thou  shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And  immediately there fell upon him a mist and darkness; and going  about he sought persons who should lead him by the hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> Then the proconsul, seeing what had happened, believed,  being amazed at the teaching of the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And having sailed from Paphos, Paul and his company came  to Perga of Pamphylia; and John separated from them and  returned to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> But they, passing through from Perga, came to Antioch of  Pisidia; and entering into the synagogue on the sabbath day  they sat down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And after the reading of the law and the prophets, the  rulers of the synagogue sent to them, saying, Brethren, if ye  have any word of exhortation to the people, speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And Paul, rising up and making a sign with the hand, said,  Israelites, and ye that fear God, hearken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> The God of this people Israel chose our fathers, and  exalted the people in their sojourn in [the] land of Egypt, and  with a high arm brought them out of it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> and for a time of about forty years he nursed them in the  desert.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And having destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,  he gave them their land as an inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> And after these things he gave [them] judges till Samuel  the prophet, [to the end of] about four hundred and fifty  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> And then they asked for a king, and God gave to them Saul,  son of Kis, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, during forty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And having removed him he raised up to them David for  king, of whom also bearing witness he said, I have found David,  the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, who shall do all my  will.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> Of this man's seed according to promise has God brought to  Israel a Saviour, Jesus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> John having proclaimed before the face of his entry [among  the people] [the] baptism of repentance to all the people of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> And as John was fulfilling his course he said, Whom do ye  suppose that I am? *I* am not [he]. But behold, there comes one  after me, the sandal of whose feet I am not worthy to loose.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> Brethren, sons of Abraham's race, and those who among you  fear God, to you has the word of this salvation been sent:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> for those who dwell in Jerusalem, and their rulers, not  having known him, have fulfilled also the voices of the  prophets which are read on every sabbath, [by] judging [him].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:28">13:28</a> And having found no cause of death [in him], they begged  of Pilate that he might be slain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:29">13:29</a> And when they had fulfilled all things written concerning  him, they took him down from the cross and put him in a  sepulchre;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:30">13:30</a> but God raised him from among [the] dead,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:31">13:31</a> who appeared for many days to those who had come up with  him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the  people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:32">13:32</a> And *we* declare unto you the glad tidings of the promise  made to the fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:33">13:33</a> that God has fulfilled this to us their children, having  raised up Jesus; as it is also written in the second psalm,  *Thou* art my Son: this day have *I* begotten thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:34">13:34</a> But that he raised him from among [the] dead, no more to  return to corruption, he spoke thus: I will give to you the  faithful mercies of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:35">13:35</a> Wherefore also he says in another, Thou wilt not suffer  thy gracious one to see corruption.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:36">13:36</a> For David indeed, having in his own generation ministered  to the will of God, fell asleep, and was added to his fathers  and saw corruption.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:37">13:37</a> But he whom God raised up did not see corruption.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:38">13:38</a> Be it known unto you, therefore, brethren, that through  this man remission of sins is preached to you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:39">13:39</a> and from all things from which ye could not be justified  in the law of Moses, in him every one that believes is  justified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:40">13:40</a> See therefore that that which is spoken in the prophets do  not come upon [you],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:41">13:41</a> Behold, ye despisers, and wonder and perish; for *I* work  a work in your days, a work which ye will in no wise believe if  one declare it to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:42">13:42</a> And as they went out they begged that these words might be  spoken to them the ensuing sabbath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:43">13:43</a> And the congregation of the synagogue having broken up,  many of the Jews and of the worshipping proselytes followed  Paul and Barnabas, who speaking to them, persuaded them to  continue in the grace of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:44">13:44</a> And on the coming sabbath almost all the city was gathered  together to hear the word of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:45">13:45</a> But the Jews, seeing the crowds, were filled with envy,  and contradicted the things said by Paul, [contradicting and]  speaking injuriously.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:46">13:46</a> And Paul and Barnabas spoke boldly and said, It was  necessary that the word of God should be first spoken to you;  but, since ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy  of eternal life, lo, we turn to the nations;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:47">13:47</a> for thus has the Lord enjoined us: I have set thee for a  light of the nations, that thou shouldest be for salvation to  the end of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:48">13:48</a> And [those of] the nations, hearing it, rejoiced, and  glorified the word of the Lord, and believed, as many as were  ordained to eternal life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:49">13:49</a> And the word of the Lord was carried through the whole  country.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:50">13:50</a> But the Jews excited the women of the upper classes who  were worshippers, and the first people of the city, and raised  a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and cast them out of  their coasts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:51">13:51</a> But they, having shaken off the dust of their feet against  them, came to Iconium.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:52">13:52</a> And the disciples were filled with joy and [the] Holy  Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And it came to pass in Iconium that they entered together  into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake that a great  multitude of both Jews and Greeks believed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> But the Jews who did not believe stirred up the minds of  [those of] the nations and made [them] evil-affected against  the brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> They stayed therefore a good while, speaking boldly,  [confiding] in the Lord, who gave witness to the word of his  grace, giving signs and wonders to be done by their hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And the multitude of the city was divided, and some were  with the Jews and some with the apostles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And when an assault was making, both of [those of] the  nations and [the] Jews with their rulers, to use [them] ill and  stone them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> they, being aware of it, fled to the cities of Lycaonia,  Lystra and Derbe, and the surrounding country,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> and there they were announcing the glad tidings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And a certain man in Lystra, impotent in his feet, sat,  [being] lame from his mother's womb, who had never walked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> This [man] heard Paul speaking, who, fixing his eyes on  him, and seeing that he had faith to be healed,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> said with a loud voice, Rise up straight upon thy feet:  and he sprang up and walked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> But the crowds, who saw what Paul had done, lifted up  their voices in Lycaonian, saying, The gods, having made  themselves like men, are come down to us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> And they called Barnabas Jupiter, and Paul Mercury,  because he took the lead in speaking.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And the priest of Jupiter who was before the city, having  brought bulls and garlands to the gates, would have done  sacrifice along with the crowds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> But the apostles Barnabas and Paul, having heard [it],  rent their garments, and rushed out to the crowd, crying</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> and saying, Men, why do ye these things? *We* also are men  of like passions with you, preaching to you to turn from these  vanities to the living God, who made the heaven, and the earth,  and the sea, and all things in them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> who in the past generations suffered all the nations to go  in their own ways,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> though indeed he did not leave himself without witness,  doing good, and giving to you from heaven rain and fruitful  seasons, filling your hearts with food and gladness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And saying these things, they with difficulty kept the  crowds from sacrificing to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> But there came Jews from Antioch and Iconium, and having  persuaded the crowds and stoned Paul, drew him out of the city,  supposing him to have died.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> But while the disciples encircled him, he rose up and  entered into the city. And on the morrow he went away with  Barnabas to Derbe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> And having announced the glad tidings to that city, and  having made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and  Iconium, and Antioch,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> establishing the souls of the disciples, exhorting them to  abide in the faith, and that through many tribulations we must  enter into the kingdom of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> And having chosen them elders in each assembly, having  prayed with fastings, they committed them to the Lord, on whom  they had believed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> And having passed through Pisidia they came to Pamphylia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> and having spoken the word in Perga, they came down to  Attalia;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> and thence they sailed away to Antioch, whence they had  been committed to the grace of God for the work which they had  fulfilled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> And having arrived, and having brought together the  assembly, they related to them all that God had done with them,  and that he had opened a door of faith to the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> And they stayed no little time with the disciples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And certain persons, having come down from Judaea, taught  the brethren, If ye shall not have been circumcised according  to the custom of Moses, ye cannot be saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> A commotion therefore having taken place, and no small  discussion on the part of Paul and Barnabas against them, they  arranged that Paul and Barnabas, and certain others from  amongst them, should go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and  elders about this question.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> They therefore, having been set on their way by the  assembly, passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, relating the  conversion of [those of] the nations. And they caused great joy  to all the brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> And being arrived at Jerusalem, they were received by the  assembly, and the apostles, and the elders, and related all  that God had wrought with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> And some of those who were of the sect of the Pharisees,  who believed, rose up from among [them], saying that they ought  to circumcise them and enjoin them to keep the law of Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> And the apostles and the elders were gathered together to  see about this matter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And much discussion having taken place, Peter, standing up,  said to them, Brethren, *ye* know that from the earliest days  God amongst you chose that the nations by my mouth should hear  the word of the glad tidings and believe.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And the heart-knowing God bore them witness, giving [them]  the Holy Spirit as to us also,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> and put no difference between us and them, having purified  their hearts by faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> Now therefore why tempt ye God, by putting a yoke upon the  neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we have  been able to bear?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> But we believe that we shall be saved by the grace of the  Lord Jesus, in the same manner as they also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> And all the multitude kept silence and listened to  Barnabas and Paul relating all the signs and wonders which God  had wrought among the nations by them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> And after they had held their peace, James answered,  saying, Brethren, listen to me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> Simon has related how God first visited to take out of  [the] nations a people for his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> And with this agree the words of the prophets; as it is  written:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:16">15:16</a> After these things I will return, and will rebuild the  tabernacle of David which is fallen, and will rebuild its  ruins, and will set it up,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:17">15:17</a> so that the residue of men may seek out the Lord, and all  the nations on whom my name is invoked, saith [the] Lord, who  does these things</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> known from eternity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> Wherefore *I* judge, not to trouble those who from the  nations turn to God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> but to write to them to abstain from pollutions of idols,  and from fornication, and from what is strangled, and from  blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> For Moses, from generations of old, has in every city  those who preach him, being read in the synagogues every  sabbath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:22">15:22</a> Then it seemed good to the apostles and to the elders,  with the whole assembly, to send chosen men from among them  with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch, Judas called Barsabas and  Silas, leading men among the brethren,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:23">15:23</a> having by their hand written [thus]: The apostles, and the  elders, and the brethren, to the brethren who are from among  [the] nations at Antioch, and [in] Syria and Cilicia, greeting:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:24">15:24</a> Inasmuch as we have heard that some who went out from  amongst us have troubled you by words, upsetting your souls,  [saying that ye must be circumcised and keep the law]; to whom  we gave no commandment;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> it seemed good to us, having arrived at a common judgment,  to send chosen men to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> men who have given up their lives for the name of our Lord  Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:27">15:27</a> We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves  also will tell you by word [of mouth] the same things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:28">15:28</a> For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay  upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:29">15:29</a> to abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from  blood, and from what is strangled, and from fornication;  keeping yourselves from which ye will do well. Farewell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:30">15:30</a> They therefore, being let go, came to Antioch, and having  gathered the multitude delivered to [them] the epistle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:31">15:31</a> And having read it, they rejoiced at the consolation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:32">15:32</a> And Judas and Silas, being themselves also prophets,  exhorted the brethren with much discourse, and strengthened  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:33">15:33</a> And having passed some time [there], they were let go in  peace from the brethren to those who sent them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:34">15:34</a>  </p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:35">15:35</a> And Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch, teaching and  announcing the glad tidings, with many others also, of the word  of the Lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:36">15:36</a> But after certain days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us  return now and visit the brethren in every city where we have  announced the word of the Lord, [and see] how they are getting  on.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:37">15:37</a> And Barnabas proposed to take with [them] John also,  called Mark;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:38">15:38</a> but Paul thought it not well to take with them him who had  abandoned them, [going back] from Pamphylia, and had not gone  with them to the work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:39">15:39</a> There arose therefore very warm feeling, so that they  separated from one another; and Barnabas taking Mark sailed  away to Cyprus;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:40">15:40</a> but Paul having chosen Silas went forth, committed by the  brethren to the grace of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:41">15:41</a> And he passed through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the  assemblies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And he came to Derbe and Lystra: and behold, a certain  disciple was there, by name Timotheus, son of a Jewish  believing woman, but [the] father a Greek,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> who had a [good] testimony of the brethren in Lystra and  Iconium.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> Him would Paul have go forth with him, and took [him and]  circumcised him on account of the Jews who were in those  places, for they all knew his father that he was a Greek.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> And as they passed through the cities they instructed them  to observe the decrees determined on by the apostles and elders  who were in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> The assemblies therefore were confirmed in the faith, and  increased in number every day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> And having passed through Phrygia and the Galatian country,  having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in  Asia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> having come down to Mysia, they attempted to go to  Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> and having passed by Mysia they descended to Troas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: There was a  certain Macedonian man, standing and beseeching him, and  saying, Pass over into Macedonia and help us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And when he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to  go forth to Macedonia, concluding that the Lord had called us  to announce to them the glad tidings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> Having sailed therefore away from Troas, we went in a  straight course to Samothracia, and on the morrow to Neapolis,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> and thence to Philippi, which is [the] first city of that  part of Macedonia, a colony. And we were staying in that city  certain days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And on the sabbath day we went outside the gate by the  river, where it was the custom for prayer to be, and we sat  down and spoke to the women who had assembled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> And a certain woman, by name Lydia, a seller of purple, of  the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard; whose heart  the Lord opened to attend to the things spoken by Paul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> And when she had been baptised and her house, she besought  [us], saying, If ye have judged me to be faithful to the Lord,  come into my house and abide [there]. And she constrained us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> And it came to pass as we were going to prayer that a  certain female slave, having a spirit of Python, met us, who  brought much profit to her masters by prophesying.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> She, having followed Paul and us, cried saying, These men  are bondmen of the Most High God, who announce to you [the] way  of salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And this she did many days. And Paul, being distressed,  turned, and said to the spirit, I enjoin thee in the name of  Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out the same hour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And her masters, seeing that the hope of their gains was  gone, having seized Paul and Silas, dragged [them] into the  market before the magistrates;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> and having brought them up to the praetors, said, These  men utterly trouble our city, being Jews,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> and announce customs which it is not lawful for us to  receive nor practise, being Romans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> And the crowd rose up too against them; and the praetors,  having torn off their clothes, commanded to scourge [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> And having laid many stripes upon them they cast [them]  into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> who, having received such a charge, cast them into the  inner prison, and secured their feet to the stocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> And at midnight Paul and Silas, in praying, were praising  God with singing, and the prisoners listened to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the  foundations of the prison shook, and all the doors were  immediately opened, and the bonds of all loosed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> And the jailor being awakened out of his sleep, and seeing  the doors of the prison opened, having drawn a sword was going  to kill himself, thinking the prisoners had fled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> But Paul called out with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself  no harm, for we are all here.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> And having asked for lights, he rushed in, and, trembling,  fell down before Paul and Silas.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> And leading them out said, Sirs, what must I do that I may  be saved?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be  saved, thou and thy house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> And they spoke to him the word of the Lord, with all that  were in his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> And he took them the same hour of the night and washed  [them] from their stripes; and was baptised, he and all his  straightway.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> And having brought them into his house he laid the table  [for them], and rejoiced with all his house, having believed in  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> And when it was day, the praetors sent the lictors,  saying, Let those men go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> And the jailor reported these words to Paul: The praetors  have sent that ye may be let go. Now therefore go out and  depart in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:37">16:37</a> But Paul said to them, Having beaten us publicly  uncondemned, us who are Romans, they have cast us into prison,  and now they thrust us out secretly? no, indeed, but let them  come themselves and bring us out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:38">16:38</a> And the lictors reported these words to the praetors. And  they were afraid when they heard they were Romans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:39">16:39</a> And they came and besought them, and having brought them  out, asked them to go out of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:40">16:40</a> And having gone out of the prison, they came to Lydia; and  having seen the brethren, they exhorted them and went away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And having journeyed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they  came to Thessalonica, where was the synagogue of the Jews.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> And according to Paul's custom he went in among them, and  on three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> opening and laying down that the Christ must have suffered  and risen up from among the dead, and that this is the Christ,  Jesus whom *I* announce to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And some of them believed, and joined themselves to Paul  and Silas, and of the Greeks who worshipped, a great multitude,  and of the chief women not a few.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> But the Jews having been stirred up to jealousy, and taken  to [themselves] certain wicked men of the lowest rabble, and  having got a crowd together, set the city in confusion; and  having beset the house of Jason sought to bring them out to the  people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> and not having found them, dragged Jason and certain  brethren before the politarchs, crying out, These [men] that  have set the world in tumult, are come here also,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> whom Jason has received; and these all do contrary to the  decrees of Caesar, saying, that there is another king, Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> And they troubled the crowd and the politarchs when they  heard these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And having taken security of Jason and the rest, they let  them go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> But the brethren immediately sent away, in the night, Paul  and Silas to Berea; who, being arrived, went away into the  synagogue of the Jews.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> And these were more noble than those in Thessalonica,  receiving the word with all readiness of mind, daily searching  the scriptures if these things were so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> Therefore many from among them believed, and of Grecian  women of the upper classes and men not a few.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> But when the Jews from Thessalonica knew that the word of  God was announced in Berea also by Paul, they came there also,  stirring up the crowds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as  to the sea; but Silas and Timotheus abode there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> But they that conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens;  and, having received a commandment to Silas and Timotheus, that  they should come to him as quickly as possible, they departed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> But in Athens, while Paul was waiting for them, his spirit  was painfully excited in him seeing the city given up to  idolatry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:17">17:17</a> He reasoned therefore in the synagogue with the Jews, and  those who worshipped, and in the market-place every day with  those he met with.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:18">17:18</a> But some also of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers  attacked him. And some said, What would this chatterer say? and  some, He seems to be an announcer of foreign demons, because he  announced the glad tidings of Jesus and the resurrection [to  them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:19">17:19</a> And having taken hold on him they brought [him] to  Areopagus, saying, Might we know what this new doctrine which  is spoken by thee [is]?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:20">17:20</a> For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears. We  wish therefore to know what these things may mean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> Now all [the] Athenians and the strangers sojourning there  spent their time in nothing else than to tell and to hear the  news.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> And Paul standing in the midst of Areopagus said,  Athenians, in every way I see you given up to demon worship;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> for, passing through and beholding your shrines, I found  also an altar on which was inscribed, To the unknown God. Whom  therefore ye reverence, not knowing [him], him I announce to  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:24">17:24</a> The God who has made the world and all things which are in  it, *he*, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in  temples made with hands,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:25">17:25</a> nor is served by men's hands as needing something, himself  giving to all life and breath and all things;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:26">17:26</a> and has made of one blood every nation of men to dwell  upon the whole face of the earth, having determined ordained  times and the boundaries of their dwelling,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:27">17:27</a> that they may seek God; if indeed they might feel after  him and find him, although he is not far from each one of us:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:28">17:28</a> for in him we live and move and exist; as also some of the  poets amongst you have said, For we are also his offspring.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:29">17:29</a> Being therefore [the] offspring of God, we ought not to  think that which is divine to be like gold or silver or stone,  [the] graven form of man's art and imagination.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:30">17:30</a> God therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance,  now enjoins men that they shall all everywhere repent,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:31">17:31</a> because he has set a day in which he is going to judge the  habitable earth in righteousness by [the] man whom he has  appointed, giving the proof [of it] to all [in] having raised  him from among [the] dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:32">17:32</a> And when they heard [of the] resurrection of the dead,  some mocked, and some said, We will hear thee again also  concerning this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:33">17:33</a> Thus Paul went out of their midst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:34">17:34</a> But some men joining themselves to him believed; among  whom also was Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman by name  Damaris, and others with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And after these things, having left Athens, he came to  Corinth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> and finding a certain Jew by name Aquila, of Pontus by  race, just come from Italy, and Priscilla his wife, (because  Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome,) came to them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> and because they were of the same trade abode with them,  and wrought. For they were tent-makers by trade.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and  persuaded Jews and Greeks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And when both Silas and Timotheus came down from Macedonia,  Paul was pressed in respect of the word, testifying to the Jews  that Jesus was the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> But as they opposed and spoke injuriously, he shook his  clothes, and said to them, Your blood be upon your own head:  *I* [am] pure; from henceforth I will go to the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And departing thence he came to the house of a certain  [man], by name Justus, who worshipped God, whose house adjoined  the synagogue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> But Crispus the ruler of the synagogue believed in the Lord  with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing,  believed, and were baptised.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And the Lord said by vision in [the] night to Paul, Fear  not, but speak and be not silent;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> because *I* am with thee, and no one shall set upon thee  to injure thee; because I have much people in this city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> And he remained [there] a year and six months, teaching  among them the word of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews with one  consent rose against Paul and led him to the judgment-seat,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> saying, This [man] persuades men to worship God contrary  to the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> But as Paul was going to open his mouth, Gallio said to  the Jews, If indeed it was some wrong or wicked criminality, O  Jews, of reason I should have borne with you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> but if it be questions about words, and names, and the law  that ye have, see to it yourselves; [for] *I* do not intend to  be judge of these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> And he drove them from the judgment-seat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And having all laid hold on Sosthenes the ruler of the  synagogue, they beat him before the judgment-seat. And Gallio  troubled himself about none of these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> And Paul, having yet stayed [there] many days, took leave  of the brethren and sailed thence to Syria, and with him  Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn his head in Cenchrea, for he  had a vow;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> and he arrived at Ephesus, and left them there. But  entering himself into the synagogue he reasoned with the Jews.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> And when they asked him that he would remain for a longer  time [with them] he did not accede,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> but bade them farewell, saying, [I must by all means keep  the coming feast at Jerusalem]; I will return to you again, if  God will: and he sailed away from Ephesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> And landing at Caesarea, and having gone up and saluted  the assembly, he went down to Antioch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> And having stayed [there] some time, he went forth,  passing in order through the country of Galatia and Phrygia,  establishing all the disciples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> But a certain Jew, Apollos by name, an Alexandrian by  race, an eloquent man, who was mighty in the scriptures,  arrived at Ephesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> He was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being  fervent in his spirit, he spoke and taught exactly the things  concerning Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> And *he* began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And  Aquila and Priscilla, having heard him, took him to [them] and  unfolded to him the way of God more exactly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> And when he purposed to go into Achaia, the brethren wrote  to the disciples engaging them to receive him, who, being come,  contributed much to those who believed through grace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:28">18:28</a> For he with great force convinced the Jews publicly,  shewing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> And it came to pass, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul,  having passed through the upper districts, came to Ephesus, and  finding certain disciples,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> he said to them, Did ye receive [the] Holy Spirit when ye  had believed? And they [said] to him, We did not even hear if  [the] Holy Spirit was [come].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And he said, To what then were ye baptised? And they said,  To the baptism of John.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> And Paul said, John indeed baptised [with] the baptism of  repentance, saying to the people that they should believe on  him that was coming after him, that is, on Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> And when they heard that, they were baptised to the name of  the Lord Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> And Paul having laid [his] hands on them, the Holy Spirit  came upon them, and they spoke with tongues and prophesied.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> And all the men were about twelve.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And entering into the synagogue, he spoke boldly during  three months, reasoning and persuading [the things] concerning  the kingdom of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> But when some were hardened and disbelieved, speaking evil  of the way before the multitude, he left them and separated the  disciples, reasoning daily in the school of Tyrannus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And this took place for two years, so that all that  inhabited Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and  Greeks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> And God wrought no ordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> so that even napkins or aprons were brought from his body  [and put] upon the sick, and the diseases left them, and the  wicked spirits went out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> And certain of the Jewish exorcists also, who went about,  took in hand to call upon those who had wicked spirits the name  of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul  preaches.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And there were certain [men], seven sons of Sceva, Jewish  high priest, who were doing this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> But the wicked spirit answering said to them, Jesus I  know, and Paul I am acquainted with; but *ye*, who are ye?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And the man in whom the wicked spirit was leaped upon  them, and having mastered both, prevailed against them, so that  they fled out of that house naked and wounded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And this became known to all, both Jews and Greeks, who  inhabited Ephesus, and fear fell upon all of them, and the name  of the Lord Jesus was magnified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> And many of those that believed came confessing and  declaring their deeds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> And many of those that practised curious arts brought  their books [of charms] and burnt them before all. And they  reckoned up the prices of them, and found it fifty thousand  pieces of silver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> Thus with might the word of the Lord increased and  prevailed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> And when these things were fulfilled, Paul purposed in his  spirit to go to Jerusalem, passing through Macedonia and  Achaia, saying, After I have been there I must see Rome also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> And having sent into Macedonia two of those ministering to  him, Timotheus and Erastus, he remained himself awhile in Asia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> And there took place at that time no small disturbance  about the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> For a certain [man] by name Demetrius, a silver-beater,  making silver temples of Artemis, brought no small gain to the  artisans;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> whom having brought together, and those who wrought in  such things, he said, Men, ye know that our well-living arises  from this work,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:26">19:26</a> and ye see and hear that this Paul has persuaded and  turned away a great crowd, not only of Ephesus, but almost of  all Asia, saying that they are no gods which are made with  hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:27">19:27</a> Now not only there is danger for us that our business come  into discredit, but also that the temple of the great goddess  Artemis be counted for nothing, and that her greatness should  be destroyed whom the whole of Asia and the world reveres.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:28">19:28</a> And having heard [this], and being filled with rage, they  cried out, saying, Great [is] Artemis of the Ephesians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:29">19:29</a> And the [whole] city was filled with confusion, and they  rushed with one accord to the theatre, having seized and  carried off with [them] Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians,  fellow-travellers of Paul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:30">19:30</a> But Paul intending to go in to the people, the disciples  suffered him not;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:31">19:31</a> and some of the Asiarchs also, who were his friends, sent  to him and urged him not to throw himself into the theatre.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:32">19:32</a> Different persons therefore cried out some different  thing; for the assembly was tumultuous, and the most did not  know for what cause they had come together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:33">19:33</a> But from among the crowd they put forward Alexander, the  Jews pushing him forward. And Alexander, beckoning with his  hand, would have made a defence to the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:34">19:34</a> But, recognising that he was a Jew, there was one cry from  all, shouting for about two hours, Great [is] Artemis of the  Ephesians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:35">19:35</a> And the townclerk, having quieted the crowd, said,  Ephesians, what man is there then who does not know that the  city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of Artemis the great,  and of the [image] which fell down from heaven?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:36">19:36</a> These things therefore being undeniable, it is necessary  that ye should be calm and do nothing headlong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:37">19:37</a> For ye have brought these men, [who are] neither  temple-plunderers, nor speak injuriously of your goddess.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:38">19:38</a> If therefore Demetrius and the artisans who [are] with him  have a matter against any one, the courts are being held, and  there are proconsuls: let them accuse one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:39">19:39</a> But if ye inquire anything concerning other matters, it  will be settled in the regular assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:40">19:40</a> For also we are in danger to be put in accusation for  sedition for this [affair] of to-day, no cause existing in  reference to which we shall be able to give a reason for this  concourse.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:41">19:41</a> And having said these things, he dismissed the assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> But after the tumult had ceased, Paul having called the  disciples to [him] and embraced [them], went away to go to  Macedonia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And having passed through those parts, and having exhorted  them with much discourse, he came to Greece.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And having spent three months [there], a treacherous plot  against him having been set on foot by the Jews, as he was  going to sail to Syria, [the] resolution was adopted of  returning through Macedonia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> And there accompanied him as far as Asia, Sopater [son] of  Pyrrhus, a Berean; and of Thessalonians, Aristarchus and  Secundus, and Gaius and Timotheus of Derbe, and of Asia,  Tychicus and Trophimus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> These going before waited for us in Troas;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of  unleavened bread, and we came to them to Troas in five days,  where we spent seven days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> And the first day of the week, we being assembled to break  bread, Paul discoursed to them, about to depart on the morrow.  And he prolonged the discourse till midnight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> And there were many lights in the upper room where we were  assembled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And a certain youth, by name Eutychus, sitting at the  window-opening, overpowered by deep sleep, while Paul  discoursed very much at length, having been overpowered by the  sleep, fell from the third story down to the bottom, and was  taken up dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> But Paul descending fell upon him, and enfolding [him] [in  his arms], said, Be not troubled, for his life is in him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> And having gone up, and having broken the bread, and  eaten, and having long spoken until daybreak, so he went away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> And they brought [away] the boy alive, and were no little  comforted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> And we, having gone before on board ship, sailed off to  Assos, going to take in Paul there; for so he had directed, he  himself being about to go on foot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:14">20:14</a> And when he met with us at Assos, having taken him on  board, we came to Mitylene;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:15">20:15</a> and having sailed thence, on the morrow arrived opposite  Chios, and the next day put in at Samos; and having stayed at  Trogyllium, the next day we came to Miletus:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> for Paul thought it desirable to sail by Ephesus, so that  he might not be made to spend time in Asia; for he hastened, if  it was possible for him, to be the day of Pentecost at  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> But from Miletus having sent to Ephesus, he called over  [to him] the elders of the assembly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> And when they were come to him, he said to them, *Ye* know  how I was with you all the time from the first day that I  arrived in Asia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:19">20:19</a> serving the Lord with all lowliness, and tears, and  temptations, which happened to me through the plots of the  Jews;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:20">20:20</a> how I held back nothing of what is profitable, so as not  to announce [it] to you, and to teach you publicly and in every  house,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:21">20:21</a> testifying to both Jews and Greeks repentance towards God,  and faith towards our Lord Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:22">20:22</a> And now, behold, bound in my spirit *I* go to Jerusalem,  not knowing what things shall happen to me in it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:23">20:23</a> only that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city,  saying that bonds and tribulations await me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:24">20:24</a> But I make no account of [my] life [as] dear to myself, so  that I finish my course, and the ministry which I have received  of the Lord Jesus, to testify the glad tidings of the grace of  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:25">20:25</a> And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have  gone about preaching the kingdom [of God], shall see my face no  more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:26">20:26</a> Wherefore I witness to you this day, that I am clean from  the blood of all,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:27">20:27</a> for I have not shrunk from announcing to you all the  counsel of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:28">20:28</a> Take heed therefore to yourselves, and to all the flock,  wherein the Holy Spirit has set you as overseers, to shepherd  the assembly of God, which he has purchased with the blood of  his own.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:29">20:29</a> [For] *I* know [this,] that there will come in amongst you  after my departure grievous wolves, not sparing the flock;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:30">20:30</a> and from among your own selves shall rise up men speaking  perverted things to draw away the disciples after them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:31">20:31</a> Wherefore watch, remembering that for three years, night  and day, I ceased not admonishing each one [of you] with tears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:32">20:32</a> And now I commit you to God, and to the word of his grace,  which is able to build [you] up and give [to you] an  inheritance among all the sanctified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:33">20:33</a> I have coveted [the] silver or gold or clothing of no one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:34">20:34</a> Yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my  wants, and to those who were with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:35">20:35</a> I have shewed you all things, that thus labouring [we]  ought to come in aid of the weak, and to remember the words of  the Lord Jesus, that he himself said, It is more blessed to  give than to receive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:36">20:36</a> And having said these things, he knelt down and prayed  with them all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:37">20:37</a> And they all wept sore; and falling upon the neck of Paul  they ardently kissed him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:38">20:38</a> specially pained by the word which he had said, that they  would no more see his face. And they went down with him to the  ship.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> And when, having got away from them, we at last sailed  away, we came by a direct course to Cos, and on the morrow to  Rhodes, and thence to Patara.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:2">21:2</a> And having found a ship passing over into Phoenicia, we  went on board and sailed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> and having sighted Cyprus, and left it on the left hand, we  sailed to Syria, and made the land at Tyre, for there the ship  was to discharge her cargo.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> And having found out the disciples, we remained there seven  days; who said to Paul by the Spirit not to go up to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> But when we had completed the days, we set out and took our  journey, all of them accompanying us, with wives and children,  till [we were] out of the city. And kneeling down upon the  shore we prayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And having embraced one another, we went on board ship, and  they returned home.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And we, having completed the voyage, arrived from Tyre at  Ptolemais, and having saluted the brethren, we remained one day  with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And leaving on the morrow, we came to Caesarea; and  entering into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was of  the seven, we abode with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> Now this man had four virgin daughters who prophesied.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> And as we stayed there many days, a certain man, by name  Agabus, a prophet, came down from Judaea,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> and coming to us and taking the girdle of Paul, and having  bound his own hands and feet, said, Thus saith the Holy Spirit,  The man whose this girdle is shall the Jews thus bind in  Jerusalem, and deliver him up into the hands of [the] Gentiles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> And when we heard these things, both we and those of the  place besought [him] not to go up to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> But Paul answered, What do ye, weeping and breaking my  heart? for *I* am ready not only to be bound, but also to die  at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And when he would not be persuaded, we were silent,  saying, The will of the Lord be done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> And after these days, having got our effects ready, we  went up to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> And [some] of the disciples from Caesarea went with us,  bringing [with them] a certain Mnason, a Cyprian, an old  disciple, with whom we were to lodge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> And when we arrived at Jerusalem the brethren gladly  received us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:18">21:18</a> And on the morrow Paul went in with us to James, and all  the elders came there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:19">21:19</a> And having saluted them, he related one by one the things  which God had wrought among the nations by his ministry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:20">21:20</a> And they having heard [it] glorified God, and said to him,  Thou seest, brother, how many myriads there are of the Jews who  have believed, and all are zealous of the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:21">21:21</a> And they have been informed concerning thee, that thou  teachest all the Jews among the nations apostasy from Moses,  saying that they should not circumcise their children, nor walk  in the customs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:22">21:22</a> What is it then? a multitude must necessarily come  together, for they will hear that thou art come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:23">21:23</a> This do therefore that we say to thee: We have four men  who have a vow on them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:24">21:24</a> take these and be purified with them, and pay their  expenses, that they may have their heads shaved; and all will  know that [of those things] of which they have been informed  about thee nothing is [true]; but that thou thyself also  walkest orderly, keeping the law.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:25">21:25</a> But concerning [those of] the nations who have believed,  we have written, deciding that they should [observe no such  thing, only to] keep themselves both from things offered to  idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from  fornication.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:26">21:26</a> Then Paul, taking the men, on the next day, having been  purified, entered with them into the temple, signifying the  time the days of the purification would be fulfilled, until the  offering was offered for every one of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:27">21:27</a> And when the seven days were nearly completed, the Jews  from Asia, having seen him in the temple, set all the crowd in  a tumult, and laid hands upon him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:28">21:28</a> crying, Israelites, help! this is the man who teaches all  everywhere against the people, and the law, and this place, and  has brought Greeks too into the temple, and profaned this holy  place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:29">21:29</a> For they had before seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him  in the city, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the  temple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:30">21:30</a> And the whole city was moved, and there was a concourse of  the people; and having laid hold on Paul they drew him out of  the temple, and immediately the doors were shut.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:31">21:31</a> And as they were seeking to kill him, a representation  came to the chiliarch of the band that the whole of Jerusalem  was in a tumult;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:32">21:32</a> who, taking with him immediately soldiers and centurions,  ran down upon them. But they, seeing the chiliarch and the  soldiers, ceased beating Paul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:33">21:33</a> Then the chiliarch came up and laid hold upon him, and  commanded [him] to be bound with two chains, and inquired who  he might be, and what he had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:34">21:34</a> And different persons cried some different thing in the  crowd. But he, not being able to know the certainty on account  of the uproar, commanded him to be brought into the fortress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:35">21:35</a> But when he got upon the stairs it was so that he was  borne by the soldiers on account of the violence of the crowd.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:36">21:36</a> For the multitude of the people followed, crying, Away  with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:37">21:37</a> But as he was about to be led into the fortress, Paul says  to the chiliarch, Is it allowed me to say something to thee?  And he said, Dost thou know Greek?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:38">21:38</a> Thou art not then that Egyptian who before these days  raised a sedition and led out into the wilderness the four  thousand men of the assassins?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:39">21:39</a> But Paul said, *I* am a Jew of Tarsus, citizen of no  insignificant city of Cilicia, and I beseech of thee, allow me  to speak to the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:40">21:40</a> And when he had allowed him, Paul, standing on the stairs,  beckoned with his hand to the people; and a great silence  having been made, he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> Brethren and fathers, hear my defence which I now make to  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> And hearing that he addressed them in the Hebrew tongue,  they kept the more quiet; and he says,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> *I* am a Jew, born in Tarsus of Cilicia, but brought up in  this city, at the feet of Gamaliel, educated according to [the]  exactness of the law of [our] fathers, being zealous for God,  as *ye* are all this day;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> who have persecuted this way unto death, binding and  delivering up to prisons both men and women;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> as also the high priest bears me witness, and all the  elderhood: from whom also, having received letters to the  brethren, I went to Damascus to bring those also who were  there, bound, to Jerusalem, to be punished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> And it came to pass, as I was journeying and drawing near  to Damascus, that, about mid-day, there suddenly shone out of  heaven a great light round about me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And I fell to the ground, and heard a voice saying to me,  Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And *I* answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said to me,  *I* am Jesus the Nazaraean, whom *thou* persecutest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> But they that were with me beheld the light, [and were  filled with fear], but heard not the voice of him that was  speaking to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to  me, Rise up, and go to Damascus, and there it shall be told  thee of all things which it is appointed thee to do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> And as I could not see, through the glory of that light,  being led by the hand of those who were with me, I came to  Damascus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And a certain Ananias, a pious man according to the law,  borne witness to by all the Jews who dwelt [there],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> coming to me and standing by me, said to me, Brother Saul,  receive thy sight. And *I*, in the same hour, received my sight  and saw him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> And he said, The God of our fathers has chosen thee  beforehand to know his will, and to see the just one, and to  hear a voice out of his mouth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> for thou shalt be a witness for him to all men of what  thou hast seen and heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> And now why lingerest thou? Arise and get baptised, and  have thy sins washed away, calling on his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> And it came to pass when I had returned to Jerusalem, and  as I was praying in the temple, that I became in ecstasy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> and saw him saying to me, Make haste and go quickly out of  Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning  me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> And *I* said, Lord, they themselves know that *I* was  imprisoning and beating in every synagogue those that believe  on thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> and when the blood of thy witness Stephen was shed, I also  myself was standing by and consenting, and kept the clothes of  them who killed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> And he said to me, Go, for *I* will send thee to the  nations afar off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> And they heard him until this word, and lifted up their  voice, saying, Away with such a one as that from the earth, for  it was not fit he should live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> And as they were crying, and throwing away their clothes,  and casting dust into the air,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> the chiliarch commanded him to be brought into the  fortress, saying that he should be examined by scourging, that  he might ascertain for what cause they cried thus against him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> But as they stretched him forward with the thongs, Paul  said to the centurion who stood [by], Is it lawful for you to  scourge a man [who is] a Roman and uncondemned?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> And the centurion, having heard it, went and reported it  to the chiliarch, saying, What art thou going to do? for this  man is a Roman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> And the chiliarch coming up said to him, Tell me, Art  *thou* a Roman? And he said, Yes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> And the chiliarch answered, *I*, for a great sum, bought  this citizenship. And Paul said, But *I* was also [free] born.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> Immediately therefore those who were going to examine him  left him, and the chiliarch also was afraid when he ascertained  that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> And on the morrow, desirous to know the certainty [of the  matter] why he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and  commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and  having brought Paul down set him before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> And Paul, fixing his eyes on the council, said, Brethren, I  have walked in all good conscience with God unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> But the high priest Ananias ordered those standing by him  to smite his mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> Then Paul said to him, God will smite thee, whited wall.  And *thou*, dost thou sit judging me according to the law, and  breaking the law commandest me to be smitten?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And those that stood by said, Dost thou rail against the  high priest of God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> And Paul said, I was not conscious, brethren, that he was  high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evilly of  the ruler of thy people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> But Paul, knowing that the one part [of them] were of the  Sadducees and the other of the Pharisees, cried out in the  council, Brethren, *I* am a Pharisee, son of Pharisees: *I* am  judged concerning the hope and resurrection of [the] dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> And when he had spoken this, there was a tumult of the  Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the multitude was divided.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> For Sadducees say there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor  spirit; but Pharisees confess both of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> And there was a great clamour, and the scribes of the  Pharisees' part rising up contended, saying, We find nothing  evil in this man; and if a spirit has spoken to him, or an  angel ...</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> And a great tumult having arisen, the chiliarch, fearing  lest Paul should have been torn in pieces by them, commanded  the troop to come down and take him by force from the midst of  them, and to bring [him] into the fortress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> But the following night the Lord stood by him, and said,  Be of good courage; for as thou hast testified the things  concerning me at Jerusalem, so thou must bear witness at Rome  also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> And when it was day, the Jews, having banded together, put  themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat  nor drink till they should kill Paul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> And they were more than forty who had joined together in  this oath;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> and they went to the chief priests and elders, and said,  We have cursed ourselves with a curse to taste nothing until we  kill Paul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> Now therefore do ye with the council make a representation  to the chiliarch so that he may bring him down to you, as about  to determine more precisely what concerns him, and we, before  he draws near, are ready to kill him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> But Paul's sister's son, having heard of the lying in  wait, came and entered into the fortress and reported [it] to  Paul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> And Paul, having called one of the centurions, said, Take  this youth to the chiliarch, for he has something to report to  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> He therefore, having taken him with [him], led him to the  chiliarch, and says, The prisoner Paul called me to [him] and  asked me to lead this youth to thee, who has something to say  to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> And the chiliarch having taken him by the hand, and having  gone apart in private, inquired, What is it that thou hast to  report to me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> And he said, The Jews have agreed together to make a  request to thee, that thou mayest bring Paul down to-morrow  into the council, as about to inquire something more precise  concerning him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> Do not thou then be persuaded by them, for there lie in  wait for him of them more than forty men, who have put  themselves under a curse neither to eat nor drink till they  kill him; and now they are ready waiting the promise from thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:22">23:22</a> The chiliarch then dismissed the youth, commanding [him],  Utter to no one that thou hast represented these things to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> And having called to [him] certain two of the centurions,  he said, Prepare two hundred soldiers that they may go as far  as Caesarea, and seventy horsemen, and two hundred light-armed  footmen, for the third hour of the night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> And [he ordered them] to provide beasts, that they might  set Paul on them and carry [him] safe through to Felix the  governor,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> having written a letter, couched in this form:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> Claudius Lysias to the most excellent governor Felix,  greeting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> This man, having been taken by the Jews, and being about  to be killed by them, I came up with the military and took out  [of their hands], having learned that he was a Roman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> And desiring to know the charge on which they accused him,  I brought him down to their council;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> whom I found to be accused of questions of their law, but  to have no charge laid against him [making him] worthy of death  or of bonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:30">23:30</a> But having received information of a plot about to be put  in execution against the man [by the Jews], I have immediately  sent him to thee, commanding also his accusers to say before  thee the things that are against him. [Farewell.]</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:31">23:31</a> The soldiers therefore, according to what was ordered  them, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:32">23:32</a> and on the morrow, having left the horsemen to go with  him, returned to the fortress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:33">23:33</a> And these, having entered into Caesarea, and given up the  letter to the governor, presented Paul also to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:34">23:34</a> And having read [it], and asked of what eparchy he was,  and learned that [he was] of Cilicia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:35">23:35</a> he said, I will hear thee fully when thine accusers also  are arrived. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod's  praetorium.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> And after five days came down the high priest Ananias, with  the elders, and a certain orator called Tertullus, and laid  their informations against Paul before the governor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And he having been called, Tertullus began to accuse,  saying, Seeing we enjoy great peace through thee, and that  excellent measures are executed for this nation by thy  forethought,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> we receive [it] always and everywhere, most excellent  Felix, with all thankfulness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> But that I may not too much intrude on thy time, I beseech  thee to hear us briefly in thy kindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> For finding this man a pest, and moving sedition among all  the Jews throughout the world, and a leader of the sect of the  Nazaraeans;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> who also attempted to profane the temple; whom we also had  seized, [and would have judged according to our law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> but Lysias, the chiliarch, coming up, took [him] away with  great force out of our hands,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> having commanded his accusers to come to thee;] of whom  thou canst thyself, in examining [him], know the certainty of  all these things of which we accuse him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> And the Jews also joined in pressing the matter against  [Paul], saying that these things were so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> But Paul, the governor having beckoned to him to speak,  answered, Knowing that for many years thou hast been judge to  this nation, I answer readily as to the things which concern  myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> As thou mayest know that there are not more than twelve  days since I went up to worship at Jerusalem,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> and neither in the temple did they find me discoursing to  any one, or making any tumultuous gathering together of the  crowd, nor in the synagogues, nor in the city;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> neither can they make good the things of which they now  accuse me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> But this I avow to thee, that in the way which they call  sect, so I serve my fathers' God, believing all things which  are written throughout the law, and in the prophets;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> having hope towards God, which they themselves also  receive, that there is to be a resurrection both of just and  unjust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> For this cause I also exercise [myself] to have in  everything a conscience without offence towards God and men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> And after a lapse of many years I arrived, bringing alms  to my nation, and offerings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> Whereupon they found me purified in the temple, with  neither crowd nor tumult. But it was certain Jews from Asia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> who ought to appear before thee and accuse, if they have  anything against me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> or let these themselves say what wrong they found in me  when I stood before the council,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> [other] than concerning this one voice which I cried  standing amongst them: I am judged this day by you touching  [the] resurrection of [the] dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And Felix, knowing accurately the things concerning the  way, adjourned them, saying, When Lysias the chiliarch is come  down I will determine your affair;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> ordering the centurion to keep him, and that he should  have freedom, and to hinder none of his friends to minister to  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:24">24:24</a> And after certain days, Felix having arrived with Drusilla  his wife, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul and heard him  concerning the faith in Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:25">24:25</a> And as he reasoned concerning righteousness, and  temperance, and the judgment about to come, Felix, being filled  with fear, answered, Go for the present, and when I get an  opportunity I will send for thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:26">24:26</a> hoping at the same time that money would be given him by  Paul: wherefore also he sent for him the oftener and communed  with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:27">24:27</a> But when two years were completed, Felix was relieved by  Porcius Festus as his successor; and Felix, desirous to oblige  the Jews, to acquire their favour, left Paul bound.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> Festus therefore, being come into the eparchy, after three  days went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> And the chief priests and the chief of the Jews laid  informations before him against Paul, and besought him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> asking as a grace against him that he would send for him to  Jerusalem, laying people in wait to kill him on the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> Festus therefore answered that Paul should be kept at  Caesarea, and that he himself was about to set out shortly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> Let therefore the persons of authority among you, says he,  going down too, if there be anything in this man, accuse him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> And having remained among them not more than eight or ten  days, he went down to Caesarea; and on the next day, having sat  down on the judgment-seat, commanded Paul to be brought.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> And when he was come, the Jews who were come down from  Jerusalem stood round, bringing many and grievous charges which  they were not able to prove:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> Paul answering for himself, Neither against the law of the  Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar, have I  offended [in] anything.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> But Festus, desirous of obliging the Jews, to acquire their  favour, answering Paul, said, Art thou willing to go up to  Jerusalem, there to be judged before me concerning these  things?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> But Paul said, I am standing before the judgment-seat of  Caesar, where I ought to be judged. To the Jews have I done no  wrong, as *thou* also very well knowest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> If then I have done any wrong and committed anything  worthy of death, I do not deprecate dying; but if there is  nothing of those things of which they accuse me, no man can  give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> Then Festus, having conferred with the council, answered,  Thou hast appealed to Caesar. To Caesar shalt thou go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> And when certain days had elapsed, Agrippa the king and  Bernice arrived at Caesarea to salute Festus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> And when they had spent many days there, Festus laid  before the king the matters relating to Paul, saying, There is  a certain man left prisoner by Felix,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:15">25:15</a> concerning whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief  priests and the elders of the Jews laid informations, requiring  judgment against him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a> to whom I answered, It is not [the] custom of the Romans  to give up any man before that the accused have the accusers  face to face, and he have got opportunity of defence touching  the charge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:17">25:17</a> When therefore they had come together here, without  putting it off, I sat the next day on the judgment-seat and  commanded the man to be brought:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> concerning whom the accusers, standing up, brought no such  accusation of guilt as *I* supposed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:19">25:19</a> but had against him certain questions of their own system  of worship, and concerning a certain Jesus who is dead, whom  Paul affirmed to be living.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:20">25:20</a> And as I myself was at a loss as to an inquiry into these  things, I said, Was he willing to go to Jerusalem and there to  be judged concerning these things?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:21">25:21</a> But Paul having appealed to be kept for the cognisance of  Augustus, I commanded him to be kept till I shall send him to  Caesar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:22">25:22</a> And Agrippa [said] to Festus, I myself also would desire  to hear the man. To-morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:23">25:23</a> On the morrow therefore, Agrippa being come, and Bernice,  with great pomp, and having entered into the hall of audience,  with the chiliarchs and the men of distinction of the city, and  Festus having given command, Paul was brought.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:24">25:24</a> And Festus said, King Agrippa, and all men who are here  present with us, ye see this person, concerning whom all the  multitude of the Jews applied to me both in Jerusalem and here,  crying out against [him] that he ought not to live any longer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:25">25:25</a> But I, having found that he had done nothing worthy of  death, and this [man] himself having appealed to Augustus, I  have decided to send him;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:26">25:26</a> concerning whom I have nothing certain to write to my  lord. Wherefore I have brought him before you, and specially  before thee, king Agrippa, so that an examination having been  gone into I may have something to write:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:27">25:27</a> for it seems to me senseless, sending a prisoner, not also  to signify the charges against him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> And Agrippa said to Paul, It is permitted thee to speak for  thyself. Then Paul stretching out his hand answered in his  defence:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:2">26:2</a> I count myself happy, king Agrippa, in having to answer  to-day before thee concerning all of which I am accused by the  Jews,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:3">26:3</a> especially because thou art acquainted with all the customs  and questions which are among the Jews; wherefore I beseech  thee to hear me patiently.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:4">26:4</a> My manner of life then from my youth, which from its  commencement was passed among my nation in Jerusalem, know all  the Jews,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:5">26:5</a> who knew me before from the outset [of my life], if they  would bear witness, that according to the strictest sect of our  religion I lived a Pharisee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:6">26:6</a> And now I stand to be judged because of the hope of the  promise made by God to our fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:7">26:7</a> to which our whole twelve tribes serving incessantly day  and night hope to arrive; about which hope, O king, I am  accused of [the] Jews.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:8">26:8</a> Why should it be judged a thing incredible in your sight if  God raises the dead?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:9">26:9</a> *I* indeed myself thought that I ought to do much against  the name of Jesus the Nazaraean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:10">26:10</a> Which also I did in Jerusalem, and myself shut up in  prisons many of the saints, having received the authority from  the chief priests; and when they were put to death I gave my  vote.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:11">26:11</a> And often punishing them in all the synagogues, I  compelled them to blaspheme. And, being exceedingly furious  against them, I persecuted them even to cities out [of our own  land].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:12">26:12</a> And when, [engaged] in this, I was journeying to Damascus,  with authority and power from the chief priests,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:13">26:13</a> at mid-day, on the way, I saw, O king, a light above the  brightness of the sun, shining from heaven round about me and  those who were journeying with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:14">26:14</a> And, when we were all fallen to the ground, I heard a  voice saying to me in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why  persecutest thou me? [it is] hard for thee to kick against  goads.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:15">26:15</a> And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, *I* am  Jesus whom *thou* persecutest:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:16">26:16</a> but rise up and stand on thy feet; for, for this purpose  have I appeared to thee, to appoint thee to be a servant and a  witness both of what thou hast seen, and of what I shall appear  to thee in,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:17">26:17</a> taking thee out from among the people, and the nations, to  whom *I* send thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:18">26:18</a> to open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to  light, and from the power of Satan to God, that they may  receive remission of sins and inheritance among them that are  sanctified by faith in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:19">26:19</a> Whereupon, king Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the  heavenly vision;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:20">26:20</a> but have, first to those both in Damascus and Jerusalem,  and to all the region of Judaea, and to the nations, announced  that they should repent and turn to God, doing works worthy of  repentance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:21">26:21</a> On account of these things the Jews, having seized me in  the temple, attempted to lay hands on and destroy me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:22">26:22</a> Having therefore met with [the] help which is from God, I  have stood firm unto this day, witnessing both to small and  great, saying nothing else than those things which both the  prophets and Moses have said should happen,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:23">26:23</a> [namely,] whether Christ should suffer; whether he first,  through resurrection of [the] dead, should announce light both  to the people and to the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:24">26:24</a> And as he answered for his defence with these things,  Festus says with a loud voice, Thou art mad, Paul; much  learning turns thee to madness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:25">26:25</a> But Paul said, I am not mad, most excellent Festus, but  utter words of truth and soberness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:26">26:26</a> for the king is informed about these things, to whom also  I speak with all freedom. For I am persuaded that of these  things nothing is hidden from him; for this was not done in a  corner.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:27">26:27</a> King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that  thou believest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:28">26:28</a> And Agrippa [said] to Paul, In a little thou persuadest me  to become a Christian.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:29">26:29</a> And Paul [said], I would to God, both in little and in  much, that not only thou, but all who have heard me this day,  should become such as *I* also am, except these bonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:30">26:30</a> And the king stood up, and the governor and Bernice, and  those who sat with them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:31">26:31</a> and having gone apart, they spoke to one another saying,  This man does nothing worthy of death or of bonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:32">26:32</a> And Agrippa said to Festus, This man might have been let  go if he had not appealed to Caesar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:1">27:1</a> But when it had been determined that we should sail to  Italy, they delivered up Paul and certain other prisoners to a  centurion, by name Julius, of Augustus' company.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:2">27:2</a> And going on board a ship of Adramyttium about to navigate  by the places along Asia, we set sail, Aristarchus, a  Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:3">27:3</a> And the next day we arrived at Sidon. And Julius treated  Paul kindly and suffered him to go to his friends and refresh  himself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:4">27:4</a> And setting sail thence we sailed under the lee of Cyprus,  because the winds were contrary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> And having sailed over the waters of Cilicia and Pamphylia  we came to Myra in Lycia:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> and there the centurion having found a ship of Alexandria  sailing to Italy, he made us go on board her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> And sailing slowly for many days, and having with  difficulty got abreast of Cnidus, the wind not suffering us, we  sailed under the lee of Crete abreast of Salmone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> and coasting it with difficulty we came to a certain place  called Fair Havens, near to which was [the] city of Lasaea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> And much time having now been spent, and navigation being  already dangerous, because the fast also was already past, Paul  counselled them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:10">27:10</a> saying, Men, I perceive that the navigation will be with  disaster and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but  also of our lives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:11">27:11</a> But the centurion believed rather the helmsman and the  shipowner than what was said by Paul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:12">27:12</a> And the harbour being ill adapted to winter in, the most  counselled to set sail thence, if perhaps they might reach  Phoenice to winter in, a port of Crete looking north-east and  south-east.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:13">27:13</a> And [the] south wind blowing gently, supposing that they  had gained their object, having weighed anchor they sailed  close in shore along Crete.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:14">27:14</a> But not long after there came down it a hurricane called  Euroclydon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:15">27:15</a> And the ship being caught and driven, and not able to  bring her head to the wind, letting her go we were driven  [before it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:16">27:16</a> But running under the lee of a certain island called  Clauda, we were with difficulty able to make ourselves masters  of the boat;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:17">27:17</a> which having hoisted up, they used helps, frapping the  ship; and fearing lest they should run into Syrtis and run  aground, and having lowered the gear they were so driven.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:18">27:18</a> But the storm being extremely violent on us, on the next  day they threw cargo overboard,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:19">27:19</a> and on the third day with their own hands they cast away  the ship furniture.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:20">27:20</a> And neither sun nor stars appearing for many days, and no  small storm lying on us, in the end all hope of our being saved  was taken away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:21">27:21</a> And when they had been a long while without taking food,  Paul then standing up in the midst of them said, Ye ought, O  men, to have hearkened to me, and not have made sail from Crete  and have gained this disaster and loss.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:22">27:22</a> And now I exhort you to be of good courage, for there  shall be no loss at all of life of [any] of you, only of the  ship.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:23">27:23</a> For an angel of the God, whose I am and whom I serve,  stood by me this night,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:24">27:24</a> saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must stand before Caesar; and  behold, God has granted to thee all those that sail with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:25">27:25</a> Wherefore be of good courage, men, for I believe God that  thus it shall be, as it has been said to me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:26">27:26</a> But we must be cast ashore on a certain island.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:27">27:27</a> And when the fourteenth night was come, we being driven  about in Adria, towards the middle of the night the sailors  supposed that some land neared them,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:28">27:28</a> and having sounded found twenty fathoms, and having gone a  little farther and having again sounded they found fifteen  fathoms;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:29">27:29</a> and fearing lest we should be cast on rocky places,  casting four anchors out of the stern, they wished that day  were come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:30">27:30</a> But the sailors wishing to flee out of the ship, and  having let down the boat into the sea under pretext of being  about to carry out anchors from the prow,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:31">27:31</a> Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these  abide in the ship *ye* cannot be saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:32">27:32</a> Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the boat and let  her fall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:33">27:33</a> And while it was drawing on to daylight, Paul exhorted  them all to partake of food, saying, Ye have passed the  fourteenth day watching in expectation without taking food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:34">27:34</a> Wherefore I exhort you to partake of food, for this has to  do with your safety; for not a hair from the head of any one of  you shall perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:35">27:35</a> And, having said these things and taken a loaf, he gave  thanks to God before all, and having broken it began to eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:36">27:36</a> And all taking courage, themselves also took food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:37">27:37</a> And we were in the ship, all the souls, two hundred and  seventy-six.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:38">27:38</a> And having satisfied themselves with food, they lightened  the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:39">27:39</a> And when it was day they did not recognise the land; but  they perceived a certain bay having a strand, on which they  were minded, if they should be able, to run the ship ashore;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:40">27:40</a> and, having cast off the anchors, they left [them] in the  sea, at the same time loosening the lashings of the rudders,  and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the  strand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:41">27:41</a> And falling into a place where two seas met they ran the  ship aground, and the prow having stuck itself fast remained  unmoved, but the stern was broken by the force of the waves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:42">27:42</a> And [the] counsel of the soldiers was that they should  kill the prisoners, lest any one should swim off and escape.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:43">27:43</a> But the centurion, desirous of saving Paul, hindered them  of their purpose, and commanded those who were able to swim,  casting themselves first [into the sea], to get out on land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:44">27:44</a> and the rest, some on boards, some on some of the things  [that came] from the ship; and thus it came to pass that all  got safe to land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> And when we got safe [to land] we then knew that the island  was called Melita.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a> But the barbarians shewed us no common kindness; for,  having kindled a fire, they took us all in because of the rain  that was falling and because of the cold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:3">28:3</a> And Paul having gathered a [certain] quantity of sticks  together in a bundle and laid [it] on the fire, a viper coming  out from the heat seized his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a> And when the barbarians saw the beast hanging from his  hand, they said to one another, This man is certainly a  murderer, whom, [though] saved out of the sea, Nemesis has not  allowed to live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a> *He* however, having shaken off the beast into the fire,  felt no harm.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a> But *they* expected that he would have swollen or fallen  down suddenly dead. But when they had expected a long time and  saw nothing unusual happen to him, changing their opinion, they  said he was a god.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a> Now in the country surrounding that place were the lands  belonging to the chief man of the island, by name Publius, who  received us and gave [us] hospitality three days in a very  friendly way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a> And it happened that the father of Publius lay ill of fever  and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and having prayed and  laid his hands on him cured him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> But this having taken place, the rest also who had  sicknesses in the island came and were healed:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> who also honoured us with many honours, and on our leaving  they made presents to us of what should minister to our wants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a> And after three months we sailed in a ship which had  wintered in the island, an Alexandrian, with [the] Dioscuri for  its ensign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:12">28:12</a> And having come to Syracuse we remained three days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> Whence, going in a circuitous course, we arrived at  Rhegium; and after one day, the wind having changed to south,  on the second day we came to Puteoli,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> where, having found brethren, we were begged to stay with  them seven days. And thus we went to Rome.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> And thence the brethren, having heard about us, came to  meet us as far as Appii Forum and Tres Tabernae, whom when Paul  saw, he thanked God and took courage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a> And when we came to Rome, [the centurion delivered up the  prisoners to the praetorian prefect, but] Paul was allowed to  remain by himself with the soldier who kept him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:17">28:17</a> And it came to pass after three days, that he called  together those who were the chief of the Jews; and when they  had come together he said to them, Brethren, *I* having done  nothing against the people or the customs of our forefathers,  have been delivered a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of  the Romans,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:18">28:18</a> who having examined me were minded to let me go, because  there was nothing worthy of death in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:19">28:19</a> But the Jews speaking against it, I was compelled to  appeal to Caesar, not as having anything to accuse my nation  of.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:20">28:20</a> For this cause therefore I have called you to [me] to see  and to speak to you; for on account of the hope of Israel I  have this chain about me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:21">28:21</a> And they said to him, For our part, we have neither  received letters from Judaea concerning thee, nor has any one  of the brethren who has arrived reported or said anything evil  concerning thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:22">28:22</a> But we beg to hear of thee what thou thinkest, for as  concerning this sect it is known to us that it is everywhere  spoken against.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:23">28:23</a> And having appointed him a day many came to him to the  lodging, to whom he expounded, testifying of the kingdom of  God, and persuading them concerning Jesus, both from the law of  Moses and the prophets, from early morning to evening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:24">28:24</a> And some were persuaded of the things which were said, but  some disbelieved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:25">28:25</a> And being disagreed among themselves they left; Paul  having spoken one word, Well spoke the Holy Spirit through  Esaias the prophet to our fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:26">28:26</a> saying, Go to this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear  and not understand, and seeing ye shall see and not perceive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:27">28:27</a> For the heart of this people has become fat, and they hear  heavily with their ears, and they have closed their eyes; lest  they should see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and  understand with their heart, and be converted, and I should  heal them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:28">28:28</a> Be it known to you therefore, that this salvation of God  has been sent to the nations; *they* also will hear [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:29">28:29</a> [And he having said this, the Jews went away, having great  reasoning among themselves.]</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:30">28:30</a> And he remained two whole years in his own hired lodging,  and received all who came to him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:31">28:31</a> preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things  concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all freedom  unhinderedly.</p>
