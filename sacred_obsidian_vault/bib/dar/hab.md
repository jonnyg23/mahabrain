  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Habakkuk</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Jehovah, how long shall I cry and thou wilt not hear? I cry  out unto thee, Violence! and thou dost not save.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Why dost thou cause me to see iniquity, and lookest thou  upon grievance? For spoiling and violence are before me; and  there is strife, and contention riseth up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Therefore the law is powerless, and justice doth never go  forth; for the wicked encompasseth the righteous; therefore  judgment goeth forth perverted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> See ye among the nations, and behold, and wonder  marvellously; for [I] work a work in your days, which ye will  not believe, though it be declared [to you].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> For behold, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and  impetuous nation, which marcheth through the breadth of the  earth, to possess dwelling-places that are not theirs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their  dignity proceed from themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And their horses are swifter than the leopards, and are more  agile than the evening wolves; and their horsemen prance  proudly, and their horsemen come from afar: they fly as an  eagle that hasteth to devour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> They come all of them for violence: the crowd of their faces  is forwards, and they gather captives as the sand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Yea, he scoffeth at kings, and princes are a scorn unto  him; he derideth every stronghold: for he heapeth up dust, and  taketh it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> Then will his mind change, and he will pass on, and become  guilty: this his power is become his +god.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> -- Art thou not from everlasting, Jehovah my God, my Holy  One? We shall not die. Jehovah, thou hast ordained him for  judgment; and thou, O Rock, hast appointed him for correction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> [Thou art] of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not  look on mischief: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal  treacherously, [and] keepest silence when the wicked swalloweth  up a [man] more righteous than he?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And thou makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the  creeping things, that have no ruler over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> He taketh up all of them with the hook, he catcheth them in  his net, and gathereth them into his drag; therefore he  rejoiceth and is glad:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> therefore he sacrificeth unto his net, and burneth incense  unto his drag; for by them his portion is become fat, and his  meat dainty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Shall he therefore empty his net, and not spare to slay the  nations continually?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and  will look forth to see what he will say unto me, and what I  shall answer as to my reproof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And Jehovah answered me and said, Write the vision, and  engrave it upon tablets, that he may run that readeth it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but it hasteth  to the end, and shall not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;  for it will surely come, it will not delay.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Behold, his soul is puffed up, it is not upright within him:  but the just shall live by his faith.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And moreover, the wine is treacherous: he is a proud man,  and keepeth not at rest, he enlargeth his desire as Sheol, and  he is like death and cannot be satisfied; and he assembleth  unto him all nations, and gathereth unto him all peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Shall not all these take up a proverb about him, and a  taunting riddle against him, and say, Woe to him that  increaseth that which is not his! how long? -- and to him that  loadeth himself with pledges!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and  they awake up that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for  booties unto them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> Because thou hast plundered many nations, all the rest of  the peoples shall plunder thee; because of men's blood, and for  the violence [done] to the land, to the city, and all that  dwell therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Woe to him that getteth iniquitous gain to his house, that  he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered from the  grasp of evil!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Thou hast devised shame to thy house, by cutting off many  peoples, and hast sinned against thine own soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out  of the timber shall answer it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and  establisheth a city by unrighteousness!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Behold, is it not of Jehovah of hosts that the peoples  labour for the fire, and the nations weary themselves in vain?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the  glory of Jehovah as the waters cover the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, -- that  pourest out thy flask, and makest [him] drunken also, that thou  mayest look on their nakedness!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Thou art filled with shame instead of glory; drink thou  also, and let thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of Jehovah's  right hand shall be turned unto thee, and a shameful spewing  shall be on thy glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> For the violence [done] to Lebanon shall cover thee, and  the destruction of beasts which made them afraid; because of  men's blood, and for the violence [done] to the land, to the  city, and all that dwell therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath  graven it? the molten image, and the teacher of falsehood, that  the maker of his work dependeth thereon, to make dumb idols?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake! to the dumb  stone, Arise! Shall it teach? Behold it is overlaid with gold  and silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> But Jehovah is in his holy temple. Let all the earth keep  silence before him!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> A Prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Jehovah, I heard the report of thee, [and] I feared.  Jehovah, revive thy work in the midst of the years, In the  midst of the years make [it] known: In wrath remember mercy!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> +God came from Teman, And the Holy One from mount Paran.  Selah. His glory covereth the heavens, And the earth is full of  his praise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And [his] brightness was as the light; Rays [came forth]  from his hand; And there was the hiding of his power.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Before him went the pestilence, And a burning flame went  forth at his feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> He stood, and measured the earth; He beheld, and discomfited  the nations; And the eternal mountains were scattered, The  everlasting hills gave way: His ways are everlasting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction; The curtains of the  land of Midian did tremble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Was Jehovah wrathful with the rivers? Was thine anger  against the rivers? Was thy rage against the sea, That thou  didst ride upon thy horses, Thy chariots of salvation?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> Thy bow was made naked, The rods [of discipline] sworn  according to [thy] word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth  with rivers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> The mountains saw thee, they were in travail: Torrents of  waters passed by; The deep uttered its voice, Lifted up its  hands on high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> The sun [and] moon stood still in their habitation, At the  light of thine arrows which shot forth, -- At the shining of  thy glittering spear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Thou didst march through the land in indignation, Thou  didst thresh the nations in anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, For the  salvation of thine anointed; Thou didst smite off the head from  the house of the wicked, Laying bare the foundation even to the  neck. Selah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Thou didst strike through with his own spears the head of  his leaders: They came out as a whirlwind to scatter me, Whose  exulting was as to devour the afflicted secretly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> Thou didst walk through the sea with thy horses, The heap  of great waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> I heard, and my belly trembled; My lips quivered at the  voice; Rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in my  place, That I might rest in the day of distress, When their  invader shall come up against the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> For though the fig-tree shall not blossom, Neither shall  fruit be in the vines; The labour of the olive-tree shall fail,  And the fields shall yield no food; The flock shall be cut off  from the fold, And there shall be no herd in the stalls:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> Yet I will rejoice in Jehovah, I will joy in the God of my  salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> Jehovah, the Lord, is my strength, And he maketh my feet  like hinds' [feet], And he will make me to walk upon my high  places. To the chief Musician. On my stringed instruments.</p>
