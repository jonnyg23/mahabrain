  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: 1 Peter</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> Peter, apostle of Jesus Christ, to [the] sojourners of [the]  dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> elect according to [the] foreknowledge of God [the] Father,  by sanctification of [the] Spirit, unto [the] obedience and  sprinkling of [the] blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and  peace be multiplied.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Blessed [be] the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,  who, according to his great mercy, has begotten us again to a  living hope through [the] resurrection of Jesus Christ from  among [the] dead,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> to an incorruptible and undefiled and unfading inheritance,  reserved in [the] heavens for you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> who are kept guarded by [the] power of God through faith for  salvation ready to be revealed in [the] last time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> Wherein ye exult, for a little while at present, if needed,  put to grief by various trials,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of  gold which perishes, though it be proved by fire, be found to  praise and glory and honour in [the] revelation of Jesus  Christ:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> whom, having not seen, ye love; on whom [though] not now  looking, but believing, ye exult with joy unspeakable and  filled with [the] glory,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> receiving the end of your faith, [the] salvation of [your]  souls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Concerning which salvation prophets, who have prophesied of  the grace towards you, sought out and searched out;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> searching what, or what manner of time, the Spirit of  Christ which [was] in them pointed out, testifying before of  the sufferings which [belonged] to Christ, and the glories  after these.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> To whom it was revealed, that not to themselves but to you  they ministered those things, which have now been announced to  you by those who have declared to you the glad tidings by [the]  Holy Spirit, sent from heaven, which angels desire to look  into.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Wherefore, having girded up the loins of your mind, [be]  sober [and] hope with perfect stedfastness in the grace [which  will be] brought to you at [the] revelation of Jesus Christ;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> as children of obedience, not conformed to [your] former  lusts in your ignorance;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> but as he who has called you is holy, be ye also holy in  all [your] conversation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> because it is written, Be ye holy, for *I* am holy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> And if ye invoke as Father him who, without regard of  persons, judges according to the work of each, pass your time  of sojourn in fear,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> knowing that ye have been redeemed, not by corruptible  [things, as] silver or gold, from your vain conversation handed  down from [your] fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> but by precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and  without spot, [the blood] of Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> foreknown indeed before [the] foundation of [the] world,  but who has been manifested at the end of times for your sakes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> who by him do believe on God, who has raised him from among  [the] dead and given him glory, that your faith and hope should  be in God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> Having purified your souls by obedience to the truth to  unfeigned brotherly love, love one another out of a pure heart  fervently;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of  incorruptible, by [the] living and abiding word of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Because all flesh [is] as grass, and all its glory as [the]  flower of grass. The grass has withered and [its] flower has  fallen;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> but the word of [the] Lord abides for eternity. But this is  the word which in the glad tidings [is] preached to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> Laying aside therefore all malice and all guile and  hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> as newborn babes desire earnestly the pure mental milk of  the word, that by it ye may grow up to salvation,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> if indeed ye have tasted that the Lord [is] good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> To whom coming, a living stone, cast away indeed as  worthless by men, but with God chosen, precious,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a  spiritual house, a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual  sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Because it is contained in the scripture: Behold, I lay in  Zion a corner stone, elect, precious: and he that believes on  him shall not be put to shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> To you therefore who believe [is] the preciousness; but to  the disobedient, the stone which the builders cast away as  worthless, this is become head of [the] corner,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> and a stone of stumbling and rock of offence; [who] stumble  at the word, being disobedient to which also they have been  appointed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> But *ye* [are] a chosen race, a kingly priesthood, a holy  nation, a people for a possession, that ye might set forth the  excellencies of him who has called you out of darkness to his  wonderful light;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> who once [were] not a people, but now God's people; who  were not enjoying mercy, but now have found mercy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Beloved, I exhort [you], as strangers and sojourners, to  abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> having your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that  [as to that] in which they speak against you as evildoers, they  may through [your] good works, [themselves] witnessing [them],  glorify God in [the] day of visitation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Be in subjection [therefore] to every human institution for  the Lord's sake; whether to [the] king as supreme,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> or to rulers as sent by him, for vengeance on evildoers,  and praise to them that do well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> Because so is the will of God, that by well-doing ye put to  silence the ignorance of senseless men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> as free, and not as having liberty as a cloak of malice,  but as God's bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Shew honour to all, love the brotherhood, fear God, honour  the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> Servants, [be] subject with all fear to your masters, not  only to the good and gentle, but also to the ill-tempered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> For this [is] acceptable, if one, for conscience sake  towards God, endure griefs, suffering unjustly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> For what glory [is it], if sinning and being buffeted ye  shall bear [it]? but if, doing good and suffering, ye shall  bear [it], this is acceptable with God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> For to this have ye been called; for Christ also has  suffered for you, leaving you a model that ye should follow in  his steps:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> who, [when] reviled, reviled not again; [when] suffering,  threatened not; but gave [himself] over into the hands of him  who judges righteously;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> who himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, in order  that, being dead to sins, we may live to righteousness: by  whose stripes ye have been healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> For ye were going astray as sheep, but have now returned to  the shepherd and overseer of your souls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> Likewise, wives, [be] subject to your own husbands, that,  even if any are disobedient to the word, they may be gained  without [the] word by the conversation of the wives,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> having witnessed your pure conversation [carried out] in  fear;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> whose adorning let it not be that outward one of tressing of  hair, and wearing gold, or putting on apparel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> but the hidden man of the heart, in the incorruptible  [ornament] of a meek and quiet spirit, which in the sight of  God is of great price.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> For thus also the holy women who have hoped in God  heretofore adorned themselves, being subject to their own  husbands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord; whose children ye  have become, doing good, and not fearing with any kind of  consternation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> [Ye] husbands likewise, dwell with [them] according to  knowledge, as with a weaker, [even] the female, vessel, giving  [them] honour, as also fellow-heirs of [the] grace of life,  that your prayers be not hindered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Finally, [be] all of one mind, sympathising, full of  brotherly love, tender hearted, humble minded;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing; but on  the contrary, blessing [others], because ye have been called to  this, that ye should inherit blessing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> For he that will love life and see good days, let him cause  his tongue to cease from evil and his lips that they speak no  guile.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And let him avoid evil, and do good; let him seek peace and  pursue it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> because [the] eyes of [the] Lord [are] on [the] righteous,  and his ears towards their supplications; but [the] face of  [the] Lord [is] against them that do evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And who shall injure you if ye have become imitators of  that which [is] good?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> But if also ye should suffer for righteousness' sake,  blessed [are ye]; but be not afraid of their fear, neither be  troubled;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> but sanctify [the] Lord the Christ in your hearts, and [be]  always prepared to [give] an answer [to] every one that asks  you to give an account of the hope that [is] in you, but with  meekness and fear;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> having a good conscience, that [as to that] in which they  speak against you as evildoers, they may be ashamed who  calumniate your good conversation in Christ.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> For [it is] better, if the will of God should will it, to  suffer [as] well-doers than [as] evildoers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> for Christ indeed has once suffered for sins, [the] just  for [the] unjust, that he might bring us to God; being put to  death in flesh, but made alive in [the] Spirit,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> in which also going he preached to the spirits [which are]  in prison,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> heretofore disobedient, when the longsuffering of God  waited in [the] days of Noah while the ark was preparing, into  which few, that is, eight souls, were saved through water:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> which figure also now saves you, [even] baptism, not a  putting away of [the] filth of flesh, but [the] demand as  before God of a good conscience, by [the] resurrection of Jesus  Christ,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> who is at [the] right hand of God, gone into heaven, angels  and authorities and powers being subjected to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> Christ, then, having suffered for us in [the] flesh, do *ye*  also arm yourselves with the same mind; for he that has  suffered in [the] flesh has done with sin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> no longer to live the rest of [his] time in [the] flesh to  men's lusts, but to God's will.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> For the time past [is] sufficient [for us] to have wrought  the will of the Gentiles, walking in lasciviousness, lusts,  wine-drinking, revels, drinkings, and unhallowed idolatries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with [them] to  the same sink of corruption, speaking injuriously [of you];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> who shall render account to him who is ready to judge [the]  living and [the] dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> For to this [end] were the glad tidings preached to [the]  dead also, that they might be judged, as regards men, after  [the] flesh, but live, as regards God, after [the] Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> But the end of all things is drawn nigh: be sober therefore,  and be watchful unto prayers;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> but before all things having fervent love among yourselves,  because love covers a multitude of sins;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> hospitable one to another, without murmuring;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> each according as he has received a gift, ministering it to  one another, as good stewards of [the] various grace of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> If any one speak -- as oracles of God; if any one minister  -- as of strength which God supplies; that God in all things  may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to whom is the glory and  the might for the ages of ages. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> Beloved, take not [as] strange the fire [of persecution]  which has taken place amongst you for [your] trial, as if a  strange thing was happening to you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> but as ye have share in the sufferings of Christ, rejoice,  that in the revelation of his glory also ye may rejoice with  exultation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> If ye are reproached in [the] name of Christ, blessed [are  ye]; for the [Spirit] of glory and the Spirit of God rests upon  you: [on their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is  glorified.]</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> Let none of you suffer indeed as murderer, or thief, or  evildoer, or as overseer of other people's matters;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> but if as a christian, let him not be ashamed, but glorify  God in this name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> For the time of having the judgment begin from the house of  God [is come]; but if first from us, what [shall be] the end of  those who obey not the glad tidings of God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And if the righteous is difficultly saved, where shall the  impious and [the] sinner appear?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> Wherefore also let them who suffer according to the will of  God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> The elders which [are] among you I exhort, who [am their]  fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of the Christ, who  also [am] partaker of the glory about to be revealed:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> shepherd the flock of God which [is] among you, exercising  oversight, not by necessity, but willingly; not for base gain,  but readily;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> not as lording it over your possessions, but being models  for the flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And when the chief shepherd is manifested ye shall receive  the unfading crown of glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> Likewise [ye] younger, be subject to [the] elder, and all of  you bind on humility towards one another; for God sets himself  against [the] proud, but to [the] humble gives grace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God,  that he may exalt you in [the due] time;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> having cast all your care upon him, for he cares about you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Be vigilant, watch. Your adversary [the] devil as a roaring  lion walks about seeking whom he may devour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Whom resist, stedfast in faith, knowing that the selfsame  sufferings are accomplished in your brotherhood which [is] in  [the] world.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> But the God of all grace who has called you to his eternal  glory in Christ Jesus, when ye have suffered for a little  while, himself shall make perfect, stablish, strengthen,  ground:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> to him [be] the glory and the might for the ages of the  ages. Amen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> By Silvanus, the faithful brother, as I suppose, I have  written to you briefly; exhorting and testifying that this is  [the] true grace of God in which ye stand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> She that is elected with [you] in Babylon salutes you, and  Marcus my son.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Salute one another with a kiss of love. Peace be with you  all who [are] in Christ.</p>
