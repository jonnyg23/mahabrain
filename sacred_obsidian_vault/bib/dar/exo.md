  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Exodus</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> And these are the names of the sons of Israel who had come  into Egypt; with Jacob had they come, each with his household:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Dan and Naphtali; Gad and Asher.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> And all the souls that had come out of the loins of Jacob  were seventy souls; and Joseph was in Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And Joseph died, and all his brethren, and all that  generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> And the children of Israel were fruitful, and swarmed and  multiplied, and became exceeding strong; and the land was full  of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And there arose a new king over Egypt, who did not know  Joseph.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And he said to his people, Behold, the people of the  children of Israel are more numerous and stronger than we.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Come on, let us deal wisely with them, lest they multiply,  and it come to pass that, if war occur, they take side with our  enemies and fight against us, and go up out of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And they set over them service-masters to oppress them with  their burdens. And they built store-cities for Pharaoh, Pithom  and Rameses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> But the more they afflicted them, the more they multiplied  and spread; and they were distressed because of the children of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And the Egyptians made the children of Israel serve with  harshness;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> and they embittered their life with hard labour in clay and  bricks, and in all manner of labour in the field: all their  labour with which they made them serve was with harshness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives -- of  whom the name of the one was Shiphrah, and the name of the  other was Puah --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and he said, When ye help the Hebrew women in bearing, and  see [them] on the stool, if it be a son, then ye shall kill  him, but if a daughter, then she shall live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of  Egypt had said to them, but saved the male children alive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And the king of Egypt called the midwives and said to them,  Why have ye done this, and saved the male children alive?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And the midwives said to Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women  are not as the Egyptian; for they are strong, and they have  borne before the midwife comes to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And God dealt well with the midwives; and the people  multiplied and became very strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that  he made them houses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> Then Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that  is born ye shall cast into the river, but every daughter ye  shall save alive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And a man of the house of Levi went and took a daughter of  Levi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And the woman conceived, and bore a son. And she saw him  that he was fair, and hid him three months.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And when she could no longer hide him, she took for him an  ark of reeds, and plastered it with resin and with pitch, and  put the child in it, and laid [it] in the sedge on the bank of  the river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And his sister stood afar off to see what would happen to  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> And the daughter of Pharaoh went down to bathe in the river;  and her maids went along by the river's side. And she saw the  ark in the midst of the sedge, and sent her handmaid and  fetched it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And she opened [it], and saw the child, and behold, the boy  wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is [one] of  the Hebrews' children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And his sister said to Pharaoh's daughter, Shall I go and  call thee a wet-nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse  the child for thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Go. And the damsel went  and called the child's mother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And Pharaoh's daughter said to her, Take this child away and  nurse it for me, and I will give [thee] thy wages. And the  woman took the child and nursed it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> And when the child was grown, she brought him to Pharaoh's  daughter, and he became her son. And she called his name Moses,  and said, Because I drew him out of the water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And it came to pass in those days, when Moses was grown,  that he went out to his brethren and looked on their burdens;  and he saw an Egyptian smiting a Hebrew, one of his brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And he turned this way and that way, and when he saw that  there was no man, he smote the Egyptian, and hid him in the  sand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> And he went out on the second day, and behold, two Hebrew  men were quarrelling; and he said to him that was in the wrong,  Why art thou smiting thy neighbour?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> And he said, Who made thee ruler and judge over us? dost  thou intend to kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian? Then  Moses feared, and said, Surely the matter is known.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> And Pharaoh heard of this matter, and sought to slay Moses.  But Moses fled from before Pharaoh, and dwelt in the land of  Midian. And he sat by the well.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> And the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came  and drew [water], and filled the troughs, to water their  father's flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the shepherds came and drove them away; but Moses rose  and helped them, and watered their flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And when they came to Reuel their father, he said, Why are  ye come so soon to-day?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And they said, An Egyptian delivered us out of the hand of  the shepherds, and also drew [water] abundantly for us, and  watered the flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> And he said to his daughters, And where is he? why then  have ye left the man behind? Call him, that he may eat bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And Moses consented to remain with the man; and he gave  Moses Zipporah his daughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> And she bore a son, and he called his name Gershom; for he  said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> And it came to pass during those many days, that the king  of Egypt died. And the children of Israel sighed because of the  bondage, and cried; and their cry came up to God because of the  bondage;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> and God heard their groaning, and God remembered his  covenant with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> and God looked upon the children of Israel, and God  acknowledged [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And Moses tended the flock of Jethro his father-in-law, the  priest of Midian. And he led the flock behind the wilderness,  and came to the mountain of God -- to Horeb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And the Angel of Jehovah appeared to him in a flame of fire  out of the midst of a thorn-bush: and he looked, and behold,  the thorn-bush burned with fire, and the thorn-bush was not  being consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And Moses said, Let me now turn aside and see this great  sight, why the thorn-bush is not burnt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And Jehovah saw that he turned aside to see, and God called  to him out of the midst of the thorn-bush and said, Moses,  Moses! And he said, Here am I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And he said, Draw not nigh hither: loose thy sandals from  off thy feet, for the place whereon thou standest is holy  ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And he said, I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham,  the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. And Moses hid his face;  for he was afraid to look at God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And Jehovah said, I have seen assuredly the affliction of my  people who are in Egypt, and their cry have I heard on account  of their taskmasters; for I know their sorrows.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And I am come down to deliver them out of the hand of the  Egyptians, and to bring them up out of that land unto a good  and spacious land, unto a land flowing with milk and honey,  unto the place of the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the  Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the  Jebusites.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And now behold, the cry of the children of Israel is come  unto me; and I have also seen the oppression with which the  Egyptians oppress them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And now come, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou  mayest bring forth my people the children of Israel out of  Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And Moses said to God, Who am I, that I should go unto  Pharaoh, and that I should bring forth the children of Israel  out of Egypt?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> And he said, For I will be with thee; and this shall be the  sign to thee that I have sent thee: when thou hast brought  forth the people out of Egypt, ye shall serve God upon this  mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> And Moses said to God, Behold, [when] I come unto the  children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your  fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say, What is his  name? what shall I say unto them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM. And he said, Thus  shalt thou say unto the children of Israel: I AM hath sent me  unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And God said moreover to Moses, Thus shalt thou say unto  the children of Israel: Jehovah, the God of your fathers, the  God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, hath  sent me unto you. This is my name for ever, and this is my  memorial unto all generations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> Go and gather the elders of Israel together, and say unto  them, Jehovah the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham,  Isaac, and Jacob, hath appeared to me, saying, I have indeed  visited you, and [seen] that which is done unto you in Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> and I have said, I will bring you up out of the affliction  of Egypt, unto the land of the Canaanites, and the Hittites,  and the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the  Jebusites, unto a land flowing with milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> And they shall hearken to thy voice. And thou shalt come,  thou and the elders of Israel, unto the king of Egypt, and ye  shall say unto him, Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, hath met  with us; and now, let us go, we pray thee, three days' journey  into the wilderness, that we may sacrifice to Jehovah our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go, no,  not by a powerful hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> And I will stretch out my hand and smite Egypt with all my  wonders which I will do in the midst thereof; and after that he  will let you go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> And I will give this people favour in the eyes of the  Egyptians, and it shall come to pass, when ye go out, that ye  shall not go out empty;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> but every woman shall ask of her neighbour, and of her that  is the inmate of her house, utensils of silver, and utensils of  gold, and clothing; and ye shall put [them] on your sons and on  your daughters, and shall spoil the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And Moses answered and said, But behold, they will not  believe me, nor hearken unto my voice; for they will say,  Jehovah has not appeared to thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And Jehovah said to him, What is that in thy hand? And he  said, A staff.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And he said, Cast it on the ground. And he cast it on the  ground, and it became a serpent; and Moses fled from before it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand and take it  by the tail -- and he stretched out his hand and caught it, and  it became a staff in his hand --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> that they may believe that Jehovah, the God of their  fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of  Jacob, hath appeared unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And Jehovah said moreover to him, Put now thy hand into thy  bosom. And he put his hand into his bosom, and took it out, and  behold, his hand was leprous, as snow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> And he said, Put thy hand into thy bosom again. And he put  his hand into his bosom again, and took it out of his bosom,  and behold, it was turned again as his flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe thee,  neither hearken to the voice of the first sign, that they will  believe the voice of the other sign.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And it shall come to pass, if they will not believe also  those two signs, neither hearken unto thy voice, that thou  shalt take of the water of the river, and pour [it] on the dry  [land]; and the water that thou takest out of the river shall  become blood upon the dry [land].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And Moses said to Jehovah, Ah Lord! I am not eloquent,  neither heretofore nor since thou hast spoken to thy servant,  for I am slow of speech and of a slow tongue.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And Jehovah said to him, Who gave man a mouth? or who  maketh dumb, or deaf, or seeing, or blind? [have] not I,  Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And now go, and I will be with thy mouth, and will teach  thee what thou shalt say.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he said, Ah Lord! send, I pray thee, by the hand [of  him whom] thou wilt send.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Then the anger of Jehovah was kindled against Moses, and he  said, Is not Aaron the Levite thy brother? I know that he can  speak well. And also behold, he goeth out to meet thee; and  when he seeth thee he will be glad in his heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> And thou shalt speak unto him, and put the words in his  mouth; and I will be with thy mouth, and with his mouth, and  will teach you what ye shall do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> And he shall speak for thee unto the people; and it shall  come to pass that he shall be to thee for a mouth, and thou  shalt be to him for God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> And thou shalt take this staff in thy hand, with which thou  shalt do the signs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> And Moses went and returned to Jethro his father-in-law,  and said to him, Let me go, I pray thee, and return to my  brethren who are in Egypt, that I may see whether they are yet  alive. And Jethro said to Moses, Go in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> And Jehovah said to Moses in Midian, Go, return to Egypt;  for all the men are dead who sought thy life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> And Moses took his wife and his sons, and set them riding  upon an ass, and he returned to the land of Egypt. And Moses  took the staff of God in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, When thou goest to return to  Egypt, see that thou do all the wonders before Pharaoh that I  have put in thy hand. And I will harden his heart, that he  shall not let the people go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> And thou shalt say to Pharaoh, Thus saith Jehovah: Israel  is my son, my firstborn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> And I say to thee, Let my son go, that he may serve me. And  if thou refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill thy son, thy  firstborn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> And it came to pass on the way, in the inn, that Jehovah  came upon him, and sought to slay him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> Then Zipporah took a stone and cut off the foreskin of her  son, and cast it at his feet, and said, A bloody husband indeed  art thou to me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> And he let him go. Then she said, A bloody husband --  because of the circumcision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> And Jehovah said to Aaron, Go into the wilderness to meet  Moses. And he went, and met him on the mountain of God, and  kissed him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> And Moses told Aaron all the words of Jehovah who had sent  him, and all the signs that he had commanded him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> And Moses and Aaron went and gathered all the elders of the  children of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> and Aaron spoke all the words that Jehovah had spoken to  Moses, and did the signs before the eyes of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> And the people believed. And when they heard that Jehovah  had visited the children of Israel, and that he had seen their  affliction, then they bowed their heads and worshipped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And afterwards Moses and Aaron went in, and said to Pharaoh,  Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel, Let my people go that  they may celebrate a feast to me in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And Pharaoh said, Who is Jehovah, to whose voice I am to  hearken to let Israel go? I do not know Jehovah, neither will I  let Israel go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And they said, The God of the Hebrews has met with us: let  us go, we pray thee, three days' journey into the wilderness,  and sacrifice to Jehovah our God; lest he fall upon us with  pestilence or with sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And the king of Egypt said to them, Why do ye, Moses and  Aaron, wish to have the people go off from their works? Away,  to your burdens!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And Pharaoh said, Behold the people of the land are now  many, and ye wish to make them rest from their burdens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And Pharaoh commanded the same day the taskmasters of the  people, and their officers, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Ye shall no more give the people straw to make brick, as  heretofore: let them go and gather straw for themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And the number of the bricks they have made heretofore shall  ye lay upon them: ye shall not diminish any of it, for they are  idle; therefore they cry, saying, Let us go [and] sacrifice to  our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Let them put heavier labour on the men, that they may be  taken up with it, and not regard vain words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And the taskmasters of the people and their officers went  out and spoke to the people, saying, Thus says Pharaoh: I will  not give you straw:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> go ye, get yourselves straw where ye may find it; but none  of your work shall be diminished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And the people were scattered abroad throughout the land of  Egypt to gather stubble for straw.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> And the taskmasters urged [them], saying, Fulfil your  labours, the daily work, as when there was straw.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> And the officers of the children of Israel, whom Pharaoh's  taskmasters had set over them, were beaten, [and] it was said,  Why have ye not fulfilled your task in making brick, both  yesterday and to-day, as heretofore?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Then the officers of the children of Israel came and cried  to Pharaoh, saying, Why dost thou deal thus with thy bondmen?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> There is no straw given to thy bondmen, and they say to us,  Make brick; and behold, thy bondmen are beaten, but it is the  fault of thy people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And he said, Ye are idle, idle! therefore ye say, Let us go  and sacrifice to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> And now go -- work! and straw shall not be given you, and  ye shall deliver the measure of bricks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And the officers of the children of Israel saw [that] it  stood ill with them, because it was said, Ye shall not diminish  anything from your bricks, the daily work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> And they met Moses and Aaron, who stood there to meet them,  as they came out from Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> And they said to them, Jehovah look upon you and judge,  that ye have made our odour to stink in the eyes of Pharaoh,  and in the eyes of his bondmen, putting a sword into their hand  to kill us!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Lord, why hast  thou done evil to this people? why now hast thou sent me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> For ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in thy name, he  hath done evil to this people; neither hast thou delivered thy  people at all!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Now shalt thou see what I will do  to Pharaoh; for by a strong hand shall he let them go, and by a  strong hand shall he drive them out of his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> And God spoke to Moses, and said to him, I am Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And I appeared unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, as  the Almighty ùGod; but by my name Jehovah I was not made known  to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And I established also my covenant with them, to give them  the land of Canaan, the land of their pilgrimage, in which they  were sojourners.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And I have heard also the groaning of the children of  Israel, whom the Egyptians have forced to serve, and I have  remembered my covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> Therefore say unto the children of Israel, I am Jehovah, and  I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians,  and I will deliver you from their service, and I will redeem  you with a stretched-out arm, and with great judgments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> And I will take you to me for a people, and will be your  God; and ye shall know that I, Jehovah your God, am he who  bringeth you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And I will bring you into the land concerning which I swore  to give it unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; and I will  give it you for a possession: I am Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And Moses spoke thus to the children of Israel; but they did  not listen to Moses from anguish of spirit, and from hard  service.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh, and did so, as  Jehovah had commanded; and Aaron cast down his staff before  Pharaoh, and before his bondmen, and it became a serpent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> And Pharaoh also called the sages and the sorcerers; and  they too, the scribes of Egypt, did so with their enchantments:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> they cast down every man his staff, and they became  serpents; but Aaron's staff swallowed up their staves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he hearkened not to  them, as Jehovah had said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Pharaoh's heart is hardened: he  refuseth to let the people go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> Go unto Pharaoh in the morning -- behold, he will go out  unto the water -- and take thy stand by the bank of the river  in front of him; and take in thy hand the staff that was turned  into a serpent.</p>

 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> And Moses and Aaron did so, as Jehovah had commanded; and  he lifted up the staff, and smote the waters that were in the  river before the eyes of Pharaoh, and before the eyes of his  bondmen; and all the waters that were in the river were turned  into blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And the fish that was in the river died; and the river  stank, and the Egyptians could not drink the water of the  river; and the blood was throughout the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> And the scribes of Egypt did so with their sorceries; and  Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, neither did he hearken to them,  as Jehovah had said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and took not  this to heart either.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> And all the Egyptians dug round about the river for water  to drink; for they could not drink of the water of the river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> And seven days were fulfilled, after Jehovah had smitten  the river.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go unto Pharaoh, and say unto  him, Thus saith Jehovah: Let my people go, that they may serve  me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And if thou refuse to let [them] go, behold, I will smite  all thy borders with frogs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And the river shall swarm with frogs, and they shall go up  and come into thy house, and into thy bedroom, and upon thy  bed, and into the house of thy bondmen, and upon thy people,  and into thine ovens, and into thy kneading-troughs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And the frogs shall come up both upon thee and upon thy  people, and upon all thy bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy  hand with thy staff over the streams, over the rivers, and over  the ponds, and cause frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> And Aaron stretched out his hand over the waters of Egypt;  and the frogs came up, and covered the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> And the scribes did so with their sorceries, and brought up  frogs on the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Intreat  Jehovah, that he may take away the frogs from me and from my  people; and I will let the people go, that they may sacrifice  to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> And Moses said to Pharaoh, Glory over me, for what time  shall I intreat for thee, and for thy bondmen, and for thy  people, to cut off the frogs from thee and from thy houses; [so  that] they shall remain in the river only?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> And he said, For to-morrow. And he said, Be it according to  thy word; that thou mayest know that there is none like Jehovah  our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And the frogs shall depart from thee, and from thy houses,  and from thy bondmen, and from thy people: they shall remain in  the river only.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> And Moses and Aaron went out from Pharaoh; and Moses cried  to Jehovah because of the frogs that he had brought against  Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and the  frogs died out of the houses, out of the courts, and out of the  fields.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And they gathered them in heaps; and the land stank.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And Pharaoh saw that there was respite; and he hardened his  heart, and hearkened not to them, as Jehovah had said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Say unto Aaron, Stretch out thy  staff, and smite the dust of the earth, and it shall become  gnats throughout the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And they did so; and Aaron stretched out his hand with his  staff, and smote the dust of the earth, and there arose gnats  on man and on beast: all the dust of the land became gnats  throughout the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And the scribes did so with their sorceries, to bring forth  gnats; but they could not. And the gnats were on man and on  beast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> Then the scribes said to Pharaoh, This is the finger of  God! But Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he hearkened not to  them, as Jehovah had said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning,  and stand before Pharaoh -- behold, he will go out to the water  -- and say to him, Thus saith Jehovah, Let my people go, that  they may serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> For, if thou do not let my people go, behold, I will send  dog-flies upon thee, and upon thy bondmen, and upon thy people,  and into thy houses; and the houses of the Egyptians shall be  full of dog-flies, and also the ground on which they are.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> And I will distinguish in that day the land of Goshen, in  which my people dwell, that no dog-flies shall be there; that  thou mayest know that I Jehovah am in the midst of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> And I will put a separation between my people and thy  people; to-morrow shall this sign be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:24">8:24</a> And Jehovah did so; and there came dog-flies in a multitude  into the house of Pharaoh, and [into] the houses of his  bondmen; and throughout the land of Egypt, the land was  corrupted by the dog-flies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:25">8:25</a> And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron, and said, Go, sacrifice  to your God in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:26">8:26</a> And Moses said, It is not proper to do so; for we should  sacrifice the abomination of the Egyptians to Jehovah our God:  lo, if we sacrificed the abomination of the Egyptians before  their eyes, would they not stone us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:27">8:27</a> We will go three days' journey into the wilderness, and  sacrifice to Jehovah our God, as he shall command us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:28">8:28</a> And Pharaoh said, I will let you go, that you may sacrifice  to Jehovah your God in the wilderness; only, go not very far  away: intreat for me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:29">8:29</a> And Moses said, Behold, I go out from thee, and will  intreat Jehovah; and the dog-flies will depart from Pharaoh,  from his bondmen, and from his people, to-morrow; only let not  Pharaoh deal deceitfully any more in not letting the people go  to sacrifice to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:30">8:30</a> And Moses went out from Pharaoh, and intreated Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:31">8:31</a> And Jehovah did according to the word of Moses; and he  removed the dog-flies from Pharaoh, from his bondmen, and from  his people; there remained not one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:32">8:32</a> And Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and would  not let the people go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh, and tell him,  Thus saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go,  that they may serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> For if thou refuse to let them go, and shalt retain them  still,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> behold, the hand of Jehovah shall be on thy cattle which is  in the field, on the horses, on the asses, on the camels, on  the oxen and on the sheep, with a very grievous plague.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> And Jehovah will distinguish between the cattle of Israel  and the cattle of Egypt; and there shall nothing die of all  that the children of Israel have.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And Jehovah appointed a set time, saying, To-morrow will  Jehovah do this thing in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And Jehovah did this thing on the following day, and all the  cattle of Egypt died; but of the cattle of the children of  Israel died not one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> And Pharaoh sent, and behold, there was not one of the  cattle of the Israelites dead. But the heart of Pharaoh was  hardened, and he did not let the people go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And Jehovah said to Moses and to Aaron, Take to yourselves  handfuls of ashes of the furnace, and let Moses scatter it  toward the heavens before the eyes of Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And it shall become fine dust over all the land of Egypt,  and shall become boils on man and on cattle, breaking out  [with] blisters, throughout the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And they took ashes of the furnace, and stood before  Pharaoh; and Moses sprinkled it toward the heavens; and it  became boils [with] blisters breaking out on man and on cattle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And the scribes could not stand before Moses because of the  boils; for the boils were on the scribes, and on all the  Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not  hearken to them, as Jehovah had told Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Rise up early in the morning,  and set thyself before Pharaoh, and say to him, Thus saith  Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews: Let my people go, that they  may serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> For I will at this time send all my plagues to thy heart,  and on thy bondmen, and on thy people; that thou mayest know  that there is none like me in all the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> For now shall I put forth my hand, and I will smite thee  and thy people with pestilence; and thou shalt be cut off from  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And for this very cause have I raised thee up, to shew thee  my power; and that my name may be declared in all the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> Dost thou still exalt thyself against my people, that thou  wilt not let them go?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> Behold, to-morrow about this time I will cause it to rain a  very grievous hail, such as hath not been in Egypt since its  foundation until now.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> And now send, [and] secure thy cattle, and all that thou  hast in the field: all the men and the cattle that are found in  the field, and are not brought home -- on them the hail shall  come down, and they shall die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> He that feared the word of Jehovah among the bondmen of  Pharaoh made his bondmen and his cattle flee into the houses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> But he that did not regard the word of Jehovah left his  bondmen and his cattle in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward the  heavens, that there may be hail throughout the land of Egypt,  upon men, and upon cattle, and upon every herb of the field in  the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> And Moses stretched out his staff toward the heavens, and  Jehovah gave thunder and hail; and the fire ran along the  ground; and Jehovah rained hail on the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> And there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very  grievous, such as there had been none like it in all the land  of Egypt since it became a nation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> And the hail smote throughout the land of Egypt all that  was in the field, both men and cattle; and the hail smote every  herb of the field, and broke every tree of the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel  were, was there no hail.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:27">9:27</a> And Pharaoh sent, and called Moses and Aaron, and said to  them, I have sinned this time: Jehovah is the righteous [one],  but I and my people are the wicked [ones].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:28">9:28</a> Intreat Jehovah that it may be enough, that there be no  more thunder of God and hail; and I will let you go, and ye  shall stay no longer!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:29">9:29</a> And Moses said to him, When I go out of the city, I will  spread out my hands to Jehovah: the thunder will cease, and  there will be no more hail; that thou mayest know that the  earth is Jehovah's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:30">9:30</a> But as to thee and thy bondmen, I know that ye do not yet  fear Jehovah Elohim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:31">9:31</a> And the flax and the barley were smitten; for the barley  was in the ear, and the flax was bolled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:32">9:32</a> But the wheat and the spelt were not smitten; for they were  not come out into ear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:33">9:33</a> And Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh, and spread out  his hands to Jehovah; and the thunders and hail ceased, and the  rain was not [any more] poured on the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:34">9:34</a> And Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunders  had ceased, and he sinned yet more, and hardened his heart, he,  and his bondmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:35">9:35</a> And the heart of Pharaoh was stubborn, neither would he let  the children of Israel go, as Jehovah had spoken by Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go in unto Pharaoh; for I have  hardened his heart, and the heart of his bondmen, that I might  do these my signs in their midst,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> and that thou mightest tell in the ears of thy son and thy  son's son what I have wrought in Egypt, and my signs which I  have done among them; and ye shall know that I am Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and said to him, Thus  saith Jehovah the God of the Hebrews: How long dost thou refuse  to humble thyself before me? let my people go, that they may  serve me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> For, if thou refuse to let my people go, behold, I will  to-morrow bring locusts into thy borders;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> and they shall cover the face of the land, so that ye will  not be able to see the land; and they shall eat the residue of  that which is escaped, which ye have remaining from the hail,  and shall eat every tree which ye have growing in the field;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> and they shall fill thy houses, and the houses of all thy  bondmen, and the houses of all the Egyptians; which neither thy  fathers nor thy fathers' fathers have seen, since the day that  they were upon the earth unto this day. And he turned and went  out from Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And Pharaoh's bondmen said to him, How long shall this man  be a snare to us? let the men go, that they may serve Jehovah  their God: dost thou not yet know that Egypt is ruined?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> And Moses and Aaron were brought again to Pharaoh. And he  said to them, Go, serve Jehovah your God. Who are they that  shall go?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And Moses said, We will go with our young and with our old,  with our sons and with our daughters; with our flocks and with  our herds will we go; for we have a feast of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And he said to them, Let Jehovah be so with you, as I let  you go, and your little ones: see that evil is before you!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> Not so: go now, ye [that are] men, and serve Jehovah! for  it is that ye have desired. And they were driven out from  Pharaoh's presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the  land of Egypt for the locusts, that they may come up over the  land of Egypt, and eat every herb of the land -- all that the  hail hath left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> And Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt,  and Jehovah brought an east wind on the land all that day and  all that night. When it was morning, the east wind brought the  locusts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> And the locusts went up over all the land of Egypt, and  rested in all the borders of Egypt, very grievous; before them  there were no such locusts as they, neither after them will be  such.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> And they covered the face of the whole land, so that the  land was darkened; and they ate every herb of the land, and all  the fruit of the trees that the hail had left; and there  remained not any green thing on the trees, and in the herbs of  the field, throughout the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> And Pharaoh called Moses and Aaron in haste; and he said,  I have sinned against Jehovah your God, and against you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> And now, forgive, I pray you, my sin only this time, and  intreat Jehovah your God that he may take away from me this  death only!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> And he went out from Pharaoh, and intreated Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And Jehovah turned a very powerful west wind, which took  away the locusts, and drove them into the Red Sea: there  remained not one locust in all the borders of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> And Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not  let the children of Israel go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand toward the  heavens, that there may be darkness in the land of Egypt -- so  that one may feel darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> And Moses stretched out his hand toward the heavens; and  there was a thick darkness throughout the land of Egypt three  days:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> they saw not one another, neither rose any from his place,  for three days. But all the children of Israel had light in  their dwellings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> And Pharaoh called Moses and said, Go, serve Jehovah;  only, let your flocks and your herds remain; let your little  ones also go with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> And Moses said, Thou must give also sacrifices and  burnt-offerings into our hands, that we may sacrifice to  Jehovah our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> Our cattle also must go with us: there shall not a hoof be  left behind; for we must take thereof to serve Jehovah our God;  and we do not know with what we must serve Jehovah, until we  come there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> But Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he would  not let them go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:28">10:28</a> And Pharaoh said to him, Get thee from me, take heed to  thyself, see my face no more; for in the day thou seest my face  thou shalt die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:29">10:29</a> And Moses said, Thou hast spoken rightly: I will see thy  face again no more!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Yet one plague will I bring upon  Pharaoh, and upon Egypt; afterwards he will let you go hence:  when he shall let [you] go altogether, he shall utterly drive  you out hence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Speak now in the ears of the people, that they ask every  man of his neighbour, and every woman of her neighbour,  utensils of silver and utensils of gold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And Jehovah gave the people favour in the eyes of the  Egyptians. Moreover the man Moses was very great in the land of  Egypt -- in the eyes of Pharaoh's bondmen, and in the eyes of  the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> And Moses said, Thus saith Jehovah: About midnight I will  go out into the midst of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And all the firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die, from  the firstborn of Pharaoh who sitteth on his throne, even unto  the firstborn of the bondwoman that is behind the mill; and all  the firstborn of cattle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And there shall be a great cry throughout the land of  Egypt, such as there hath been none like it, nor shall be like  it any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> But against any of the children of Israel shall not a dog  move his tongue, against man or beast; that ye may know that  Jehovah distinguisheth between the Egyptians and Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And all these thy bondmen shall come down unto me, and bow  down to me, saying, Go out, thou, and all the people that  follow thee; and after that I will go out. And he went out from  Pharaoh in a glowing anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And Jehovah had said to Moses, Pharaoh shall not hearken to  you; that my wonders may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And Moses and Aaron did all these wonders before Pharaoh;  but Jehovah made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not let  the children of Israel go out of his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> This month shall be unto you the beginning of months: it  shall be the first month of the year to you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> Speak unto all the assembly of Israel, saying, On the tenth  of this month let them take themselves each a lamb, for a  father's house, a lamb for a house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> And if the household be too small for a lamb, let him and  his neighbour next unto his house take [it] according to the  number of the souls; each according to [the measure] of his  eating shall ye count for the lamb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> Your lamb shall be without blemish, a yearling male; ye  shall take [it] from the sheep, or from the goats.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> And ye shall keep it until the fourteenth day of this  month; and the whole congregation of the assembly of Israel  shall kill it between the two evenings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And they shall take of the blood, and put [it] on the two  door-posts and on the lintel of the houses in which they eat  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> And they shall eat the flesh in that night, roast with  fire, and unleavened bread; with bitter [herbs] shall they eat  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> Ye shall eat none of it raw, nor boiled at all with water,  but roast with fire; its head with its legs and with its  in-wards.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And ye shall let none of it remain until the morning; and  what remaineth of it until the morning ye shall burn with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> And thus shall ye eat it: your loins shall be girded, your  sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall  eat it in haste; it is Jehovah's passover.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> And I will go through the land of Egypt in that night, and  smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and  beast; and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute  judgment: I am Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> And the blood shall be for you as a sign on the houses in  which ye are; and when I see the blood, I will pass over you;  and the plague shall not be among you for destruction, when I  smite the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> And this day shall be unto you for a memorial; and ye  shall celebrate it [as] a feast to Jehovah; throughout your  generations [as] an ordinance for ever shall ye celebrate it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> Seven days shall ye eat unleavened bread: on the very  first day ye shall put away leaven out of your houses; for  whoever eateth leavened bread from the first day until the  seventh day -- that soul shall be cut off from Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And on the first day ye shall have a holy convocation, and  on the seventh day a holy convocation: no manner of work shall  be done on them, save what is eaten by every person -- that  only shall be done by you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And ye shall keep the [feast of] unleavened [bread]; for  in this same day have I brought your hosts out of the land of  Egypt; and ye shall keep this day in your generations [as] an  ordinance for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:18">12:18</a> In the first [month], on the fourteenth day of the month,  in the evening, ye shall eat unleavened bread until the one and  twentieth day of the month in the evening.</p>

 <p><a name="an_12:20">12:20</a> Ye shall eat nothing leavened: in all your dwellings shall  ye eat unleavened bread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:21">12:21</a> And Moses called all the elders of Israel, and said to  them, Seize and take yourselves lambs for your families, and  kill the passover.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:22">12:22</a> And take a bunch of hyssop, and dip [it] in the blood that  is in the bason, and smear the lintel and the two door-posts  with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go  out of the door of his house until the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:23">12:23</a> And Jehovah will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and  when he sees the blood on the lintel, and on the two  door-posts, Jehovah will pass over the door, and will not  suffer the destroyer to come into your houses to smite [you].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:24">12:24</a> And ye shall observe this as an ordinance for thee and for  thy sons for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:25">12:25</a> And it shall come to pass, when ye are come into the land  that Jehovah will give you, as he has promised, that ye shall  keep this service.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:26">12:26</a> And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say to  you, What mean ye by this service?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:27">12:27</a> that ye shall say, It is a sacrifice of passover to  Jehovah, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel  in Egypt when he smote the Egyptians and delivered our houses.  And the people bowed their heads and worshipped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:28">12:28</a> And the children of Israel went away, and did as Jehovah  had commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:29">12:29</a> And it came to pass that at midnight Jehovah smote all the  firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh  who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the captive that was  in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of cattle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:30">12:30</a> And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his bondmen,  and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for  there was not a house in which there was not one dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:31">12:31</a> And he called Moses and Aaron in the night, and said, Rise  up, go away from among my people, both ye and the children of  Israel; and go, serve Jehovah, as ye have said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:32">12:32</a> Also take your flocks and your herds, as ye have said, and  go; and bless me also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:33">12:33</a> And the Egyptians urged the people, to send them out of  the land in haste; for they said, We are all dead [men]!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:34">12:34</a> And the people took their dough before it was leavened;  their kneading-troughs bound up in their clothes upon their  shoulders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:35">12:35</a> And the children of Israel had done according to the word  of Moses, and they had asked of the Egyptians utensils of  silver, and utensils of gold, and clothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:36">12:36</a> And Jehovah had given the people favour in the eyes of the  Egyptians, and they gave to them; and they spoiled the  Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:37">12:37</a> And the children of Israel journeyed from Rameses to  Succoth, about six hundred thousand on foot [that were] men,  besides children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:38">12:38</a> And a mixed multitude went up also with them; and flocks  and herds -- very much cattle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:39">12:39</a> And they baked the dough that they brought forth out of  Egypt into unleavened cakes, for it was not leavened; for they  were driven out of Egypt, and could not wait; neither had they  prepared for themselves any food.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:40">12:40</a> And the residence of the children of Israel that they  resided in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:41">12:41</a> And it came to pass at the end of the four hundred and  thirty years, on that same day it came to pass that all the  hosts of Jehovah went out from the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:42">12:42</a> It is a night of observance to Jehovah, because of their  being brought out from the land of Egypt: that same night is an  observance to Jehovah for all the children of Israel in their  generations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:43">12:43</a> And Jehovah said to Moses and Aaron, This is the ordinance  of the passover: No stranger shall eat of it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:44">12:44</a> but every man's bondman that is bought for money -- let  him be circumcised: then shall he eat it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:45">12:45</a> A settler and a hired servant shall not eat it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:46">12:46</a> In one house shall it be eaten; thou shalt not carry forth  any of the flesh abroad out of the house; neither shall ye  break a bone thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:47">12:47</a> All the assembly of Israel shall hold it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:48">12:48</a> And when a sojourner sojourneth with thee, and would hold  the passover to Jehovah, let all his males be circumcised, and  then let him come near and hold it; and he shall be as one that  is born in the land; but no uncircumcised person shall eat  thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:49">12:49</a> One law shall be for him that is home-born and for the  sojourner that sojourneth among you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:50">12:50</a> And all the children of Israel did as Jehovah had  commanded Moses and Aaron; so did they.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:51">12:51</a> And it came to pass on that same day, [that] Jehovah  brought the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt  according to their hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> Hallow unto me every firstborn, whatever breaketh open the  womb among the children of Israel, of man and of cattle: it is  mine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And Moses said to the people, Remember this day, in which  ye came out from Egypt, out of the house of bondage; for with a  powerful hand hath Jehovah brought you out from this; and  nothing leavened shall be eaten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Ye come out to-day, in the month Abib.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the  land of the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Amorite and the  Hivite and the Jebusite, which he swore to thy fathers to give  thee, a land flowing with milk and honey, that thou shalt keep  this service in this month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> Seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread; and in the  seventh day is a feast to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Unleavened bread shall be eaten the seven days; and  leavened bread shall not be seen with thee, neither shall there  be leaven seen with thee in all thy borders.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And thou shalt inform thy son in that day, saying, It is  because of what Jehovah did to me when I came out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And it shall be for a sign to thee on thy hand, and for a  memorial between thine eyes, that the law of Jehovah may be in  thy mouth; for with a powerful hand hath Jehovah brought thee  out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> And thou shalt keep this ordinance at its set time from  year to year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> And it shall be when Jehovah hath brought thee into the  land of the Canaanites, as he hath sworn to thee and to thy  fathers, and hath given it thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> that thou shalt offer unto Jehovah all that breaketh open  the womb, and every firstling that cometh of cattle which is  thine: the males [shall be] Jehovah's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And every firstling of an ass shalt thou ransom with a  lamb; and if thou do not ransom it, thou shalt break its neck;  and every firstborn of a man among thy sons shalt thou ransom.</p>

 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> And it came to pass, when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to  let us go, that Jehovah slew all the firstborn in the land of  Egypt, both the firstborn of men and the firstborn of cattle:  therefore I sacrifice to Jehovah all that breaketh open the  womb -- being males; and every firstborn of my children I  ransom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> And it shall be for a sign on thy hand, and for frontlets  between thine eyes, for with a powerful hand Jehovah brought us  forth out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And it came to pass, when Pharaoh let the people go, that  God did not lead them the way of the land of the Philistines,  although that was near; for God said, That the people may not  repent when they see conflict, and return to Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> And God led the people about, the way of the wilderness of  the Red Sea; and the children of Israel went arrayed out of the  land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> And Moses took the bones of Joseph with him; for he had  made the children of Israel swear an oath, saying, God will be  sure to visit you; then ye shall carry my bones with you hence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> And they took their journey from Succoth, and encamped in  Etham, at the end of the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> And Jehovah went before their face by day in a pillar of a  cloud, to lead them [in] the way; and by night in a pillar of  fire, to give them light; so that they could go day and night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> The pillar of the cloud did not remove [from] before the  people by day, nor the pillar of fire by night.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> Speak unto the children of Israel, that they turn and  encamp before Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea: before  Baal-Zephon, opposite to it, shall ye encamp by the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> And Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel, They are  entangled in the land, the wilderness has hemmed them in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And I will harden Pharaoh's heart, that he may pursue after  them; and I will glorify myself in Pharaoh, and in all his  host; and the Egyptians shall know that I am Jehovah. And they  did so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And it was told the king of Egypt that the people had fled;  and the heart of Pharaoh and of his bondmen was turned against  the people, and they said, Why have we done this, that we have  let Israel go from our service?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And he yoked his chariot, and took his people with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And he took six hundred chosen chariots, and all the  chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And Jehovah hardened the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt,  and he pursued after the children of Israel; and the children  of Israel had gone out with a high hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And the Egyptians pursued after them, -- all the horses and  chariots of Pharaoh, and his horsemen, and his army, and  overtook them where they had encamped by the sea, beside  Pi-hahiroth, opposite to Baal-Zephon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> And Pharaoh approached; and the children of Israel lifted  up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians marched after them;  and the children of Israel were much afraid, and cried out to  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And they said to Moses, Is it because there were no graves  in Egypt, thou hast taken us away to die in the wilderness? why  hast thou done this to us, that thou hast led us out of Egypt?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> Is not this what we told thee in Egypt, when we said, Let  us alone, and we will serve the Egyptians? For [it had been]  better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the  wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And Moses said to the people, Fear not: stand still, and  see the salvation of Jehovah, which he will work for you  to-day; for the Egyptians whom ye have seen to-day, ye shall  see them again no more for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> Jehovah will fight for you, and ye shall be still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Why dost thou cry unto me?  Speak unto the children of Israel, that they go forward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> And thou, lift thy staff, and stretch out thy hand over  the sea, and divide it; and the children of Israel shall go on  dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.</p>

 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and Jehovah  made the sea go [back] by a strong east wind all the night, and  made the sea dry [land], and the waters were divided.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> And the children of Israel went through the midst of the  sea on the dry [ground]; and the waters were a wall to them on  their right hand and on their left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:23">14:23</a> And the Egyptians pursued and came after them -- all  Pharaoh's horses, his chariots and his horsemen, into the midst  of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:24">14:24</a> And it came to pass in the morning watch, that Jehovah  looked upon the camp of the Egyptians, in the pillar of fire  and of the cloud, and embarrassed the camp of the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:25">14:25</a> And he took off their chariot wheels, and caused them to  drive with difficulty; and the Egyptians said, Let us flee  before Israel, for Jehovah is fighting for them against the  Egyptians!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:26">14:26</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Stretch out thy hand over the  sea, that the waters may return upon the Egyptians, upon their  chariots and upon their horsemen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:27">14:27</a> And Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea  returned to its strength toward the morning; and the Egyptians  fled against it; and Jehovah overturned the Egyptians into the  midst of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:28">14:28</a> And the waters returned, and covered the chariots and the  horsemen of all the host of Pharaoh that had come into the sea  after them; there remained not even one of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:29">14:29</a> And the children of Israel walked on dry [ground] through  the midst of the sea; and the waters were a wall to them on  their right hand and on their left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:30">14:30</a> Thus Jehovah saved Israel that day out of the hand of the  Egyptians; and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the sea-shore.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:31">14:31</a> And Israel saw the great power [with] which Jehovah had  wrought against the Egyptians; and the people feared Jehovah,  and believed in Jehovah, and in Moses his bondman.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> Then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song to  Jehovah, and spoke, saying, I will sing unto Jehovah, for he is  highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the  sea.</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> Pharaoh's chariots and his army hath he cast into the sea;  His chosen captains also are drowned in the Red Sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> The depths covered them; they sank to the bottom as a  stone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> Thy right hand, Jehovah, is become glorious in power: Thy  right hand, Jehovah, hath dashed in pieces the enemy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And by the greatness of thine excellency thou hast  overthrown thine adversaries: Thou sentest forth thy burning  wrath, it consumed them as stubble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> And by the breath of thy nostrils the waters were heaped  up; The streams stood as a mound; The depths were congealed in  the heart of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:9">15:9</a> The enemy said, I will pursue, I will overtake, I will  divide the spoil; my soul shall be sated upon them; I will  unsheath my sword, my hand shall dispossess them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:10">15:10</a> Thou didst blow with thy breath, the sea covered them;  They sank as lead in the mighty waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:11">15:11</a> Who is like unto thee, Jehovah, among the gods? Who is  like unto thee, glorifying thyself in holiness, Fearful [in]  praises, doing wonders?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:12">15:12</a> Thou stretchedst out thy right hand, the earth swallowed  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:13">15:13</a> Thou by thy mercy hast led forth the people that thou hast  redeemed; Thou hast guided them by thy strength unto the abode  of thy holiness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:14">15:14</a> The peoples heard it, they were afraid: A thrill seized  the inhabitants of Philistia.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:15">15:15</a> Then the princes of Edom were amazed; The mighty men of  Moab, trembling hath seized them; All the inhabitants of Canaan  melted away.</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:18">15:18</a> Jehovah shall reign for ever and ever!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:19">15:19</a> For the horse of Pharaoh, with his chariots and with his  horsemen, came into the sea, and Jehovah brought again the  waters of the sea upon them; and the children of Israel went on  dry [ground] through the midst of the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> And Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took the  tambour in her hand, and all the women went out after her with  tambours and with dances.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:21">15:21</a> And Miriam answered them, Sing to Jehovah, for he is  highly exalted: The horse and his rider hath he thrown into the  sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:22">15:22</a> And Moses brought Israel from the Red Sea, and they went  out into the wilderness of Shur; and they went three days in  the wilderness, and found no water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:23">15:23</a> And they came to Marah, and could not drink the waters of  Marah, for they were bitter; therefore the name of it was  called Marah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:24">15:24</a> And the people murmured against Moses, saying, What shall  we drink?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:25">15:25</a> And he cried to Jehovah; and Jehovah shewed him wood, and  he cast it into the waters, and the waters became sweet. There  he made for them a statute and an ordinance; and there he  tested them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:26">15:26</a> And he said, If thou wilt diligently hearken to the voice  of Jehovah thy God, and do what is right in his eyes, and  incline thine ears to his commandments, and keep all his  statutes, I will put none of the complaints upon thee that I  have put upon the Egyptians; for I am Jehovah who healeth thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:27">15:27</a> And they came to Elim; and twelve springs of water were  there, and seventy palm trees; and they encamped there by the  waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:1">16:1</a> And they journeyed from Elim, and the whole assembly of the  children of Israel came into the wilderness of Sin, which is  between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second  month after their departure out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:2">16:2</a> And the whole assembly of the children of Israel murmured  against Moses and against Aaron in the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> And the children of Israel said to them, Would that we had  died by the hand of Jehovah in the land of Egypt, when we sat  by the flesh-pots, when we ate bread to the full; for ye have  brought us out into this wilderness, to kill this whole  congregation with hunger!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> Then said Jehovah to Moses, Behold, I will rain bread from  heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather the  daily need on its day, that I may prove them, whether they will  walk in my law, or not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> And it shall come to pass on the sixth day, that they shall  prepare what they have brought in; and it shall be twice as  much as they shall gather daily.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> And Moses and Aaron said to all the children of Israel, In  the evening, then shall ye know that Jehovah has brought you  out from the land of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> and in the morning, then shall ye see the glory of Jehovah;  for he has heard your murmurings against Jehovah; -- and what  are we, that ye murmur against us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:8">16:8</a> And Moses said, When Jehovah gives you in the evening flesh  to eat, and in the morning bread to the full; for Jehovah hears  your murmurings which ye murmur against him ... and what [are]  we? your murmurings are not against us, but against Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:9">16:9</a> And Moses spoke to Aaron, Say to all the assembly of the  children of Israel, Come near into the presence of Jehovah; for  he has heard your murmurings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And it came to pass, when Aaron spoke to the whole  assembly of the children of Israel, that they turned toward the  wilderness, and behold, the glory of Jehovah appeared in the  cloud.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> And Jehovah spoke to Moses, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel:  speak to them, saying, Between the two evenings ye shall eat  flesh, and in the morning ye shall be filled with bread; and ye  shall know that I am Jehovah your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> And it came to pass in the evening, that quails came up,  and covered the camp; and in the morning the dew lay round the  camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> And when the dew that lay [round it] was gone up, behold,  on the face of the wilderness there was [something] fine,  granular, fine as hoar-frost, on the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:15">16:15</a> And the children of Israel saw [it], and said one to  another, What is it? for they did not know what it was. And  Moses said to them, This is the bread which Jehovah has given  you to eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> This is the thing which Jehovah has commanded: Gather of  it every man according to what he can eat, an omer a poll,  [according to] the number of your persons: ye shall take every  man for those that are in his tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> And the children of Israel did so, and gathered, some  much, some little.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> And they measured with the omer: then he that gathered  much had nothing over, and he that gathered little wanted  nothing: they had gathered every man according to the measure  of his eating.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> And Moses said to them, Let no man leave [any] of it until  the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:20">16:20</a> But they did not hearken to Moses; and some men left of it  until the morning; then worms bred in it and it stank. And  Moses was wroth with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:21">16:21</a> And they gathered it every morning, every man as much as  he could eat; and when the sun became hot, it melted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:22">16:22</a> And it came to pass on the sixth day, that they gathered  twice as much bread, two omers for one; and all the princes of  the assembly came and told Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:23">16:23</a> And he said to them, This is what Jehovah has said:  To-morrow is the rest, the holy sabbath, of Jehovah: bake what  ye will bake, and cook what ye will cook; and lay up for  yourselves all that remains over, to be kept for the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:24">16:24</a> And they laid it up for the morning, as Moses had  commanded; and it did not stink, neither was there any worm in  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:25">16:25</a> And Moses said, Eat it to-day; for to-day is sabbath to  Jehovah: to-day ye shall not find it in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:26">16:26</a> Six days shall ye gather it; but on the seventh day is  sabbath: on it there shall be none.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:27">16:27</a> And it came to pass on the seventh day that there went out  [some] from the people to gather [it], and they found none.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:28">16:28</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, How long do ye refuse to keep  my commandments and my laws?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:29">16:29</a> See, for Jehovah hath given you the sabbath; therefore he  giveth you on the sixth day the bread for two days. Abide every  man in his place: let no man go from his place on the seventh  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:30">16:30</a> And the people rested on the seventh day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:31">16:31</a> And the house of Israel called its name Manna; and it was  like coriander-seed, white; and the taste of it was like cake  with honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:32">16:32</a> And Moses said, This is the thing which Jehovah has  commanded: Fill an omer of it to be kept for your generations;  that they may see the bread that I gave you to eat in the  wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:33">16:33</a> And Moses said to Aaron, Take a pot, and put in it an omer  full of manna, and deposit it before Jehovah, to be kept for  your generations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:34">16:34</a> As Jehovah had commanded Moses, so Aaron deposited it  before the Testimony, to be kept.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:35">16:35</a> And the children of Israel ate the manna forty years,  until they came into an inhabited land: they ate the manna  until they came to the borders of the land of Canaan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:36">16:36</a> Now an omer is the tenth [part] of an ephah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:1">17:1</a> And all the assembly of the children of Israel journeyed  from the wilderness of Sin, according to their journeys, at the  command of Jehovah; and they encamped in Rephidim; and there  was no water for the people to drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:2">17:2</a> And the people contended with Moses, and said, Give us  water, that we may drink! And Moses said to them, Why do ye  dispute with me? Why do ye tempt Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:3">17:3</a> And the people thirsted there for water; and the people  murmured against Moses, and said, Why is it that thou hast  brought us up out of Egypt, to kill us and our children and our  cattle with thirst?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:4">17:4</a> And Moses cried to Jehovah, saying, What shall I do with  this people? Yet a little, and they will stone me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:5">17:5</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go on before the people, and  take with thee of the elders of Israel, and thy staff with  which thou didst smite the river, take in thy hand, and go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:6">17:6</a> Behold, I will stand before thee there upon the rock on  Horeb; and thou shalt strike the rock, and there shall come  water out of it, that the people may drink. And Moses did so  before the eyes of the elders of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:7">17:7</a> And he called the name of the place Massah, and Meribah,  because of the contention of the children of Israel, and  because they had tempted Jehovah, saying, Is Jehovah among us,  or not?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:8">17:8</a> And Amalek came and fought with Israel in Rephidim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:9">17:9</a> And Moses said to Joshua, Choose us men, and go out, fight  with Amalek; to-morrow I will stand on the top of the hill with  the staff of God in my hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:10">17:10</a> And Joshua did as Moses had said to him, to fight with  Amalek; and Moses, Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the  hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:11">17:11</a> And it came to pass when Moses raised his hand, that  Israel prevailed; and when he let down his hand, Amalek  prevailed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:12">17:12</a> And Moses' hands were heavy; then they took a stone, and  put [it] under him, and he sat on it; and Aaron and Hur  supported his hands, one on this side, and one on that side;  and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:13">17:13</a> And Joshua broke the power of Amalek and his people with  the edge of the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:14">17:14</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Write this [for] a memorial in  the book, and rehearse [it] in the ears of Joshua, that I will  utterly blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under the  heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:15">17:15</a> And Moses built an altar, and called the name of it  Jehovah-nissi.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:16">17:16</a> And he said, For the hand is on the throne of Jah; Jehovah  will have war with Amalek from generation to generation!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> And Jethro the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law,  heard of all that God had done to Moses, and to Israel his  people; that Jehovah had brought Israel out of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:2">18:2</a> And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took Zipporah, Moses'  wife, after he had sent her back,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> and her two sons, of whom the name of the one was Gershom  -- for he said, I have been a sojourner in a foreign land,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> -- and the name of the other, Eliezer -- For the God of my  father has been my help, and has delivered me from the sword of  Pharaoh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, came to Moses with his  sons and his wife into the wilderness, where he encamped at the  mountain of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:6">18:6</a> And he sent word to Moses: I, thy father-in-law Jethro, am  come to thee, and thy wife, and her two sons with her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:7">18:7</a> And Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and did  obeisance, and kissed him; and they asked each other [after]  their welfare, and went into the tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:8">18:8</a> And Moses told his father-in-law all that Jehovah had done  to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians for Israel's sake; all the  trouble that had befallen them on the way, and [how] Jehovah  had delivered them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And Jethro rejoiced for all the goodness that Jehovah had  done to Israel; that he had delivered them out of the hand of  the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> And Jethro said, Blessed be Jehovah, who has delivered you  out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of  Pharaoh; who has delivered the people from under the hand of  the Egyptians.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> Now I know that Jehovah is greater than all gods; for in  the thing in which they acted haughtily [he was] above them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> And Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, took a burnt-offering  and sacrifices for God; and Aaron came, and all the elders of  Israel, to eat bread with Moses' father-in-law in the presence  of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge  the people; and the people stood by Moses from the morning to  the evening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:14">18:14</a> And Moses' father-in-law saw all that he did with the  people, and said, What is this thing which thou art doing with  the people? why dost thou sit alone, and all the people are  standing by thee from morning to evening?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:15">18:15</a> And Moses said to his father-in-law, Because the people  come to me to enquire of God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:16">18:16</a> When they have a matter, they come to me, and I judge  between one and another; and I make known [to them] the  statutes of God, and his laws.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> And Moses' father-in-law said to him, The thing that thou  art doing is not good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> Thou wilt be quite exhausted, both thou and this people  that is with thee; for the thing is too heavy for thee: thou  canst not perform it alone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> Hearken now to my voice: I will give thee counsel, and God  shall be with thee. Be thou for the people with God, and bring  the matters before God;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> and teach them the statutes and the laws, and make known  to them the way in which they must walk, and the work that they  must do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> But do thou provide among all the people able men, such as  fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness; and place [them]  over them, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds, chiefs of  fifties, and chiefs of tens,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> that they may judge the people at all times; and it shall  be [that] they shall bring to thee every great matter, and that  they shall judge every small matter, and they shall lighten  [the task] on thee, and they shall bear [it] with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> If thou do this thing, and God command thee [so], thou  wilt be able to endure, and all this people shall also go to  their place in peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:24">18:24</a> And Moses hearkened to the voice of his father-in-law, and  did all that he had said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:25">18:25</a> And Moses chose able men out of all Israel, and made them  heads over the people, chiefs of thousands, chiefs of hundreds,  chiefs of fifties, and chiefs of tens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:26">18:26</a> And they judged the people at all times: the hard matters  they brought to Moses, but every small matter they judged.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:27">18:27</a> And Moses sent away his father-in-law, and he departed  into his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> In the third month after the departure of the children of  Israel out of the land of Egypt, the same day came they [into]  the wilderness of Sinai:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> they departed from Rephidim, and came [into] the wilderness  of Sinai, and encamped in the wilderness; and Israel encamped  there before the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> And Moses went up to God, and Jehovah called to him out of  the mountain, saying, Thus shalt thou say to the house of  Jacob, and tell the children of Israel:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> Ye have seen what I have done to the Egyptians, and [how] I  have borne you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> And now, if ye will hearken to my voice indeed and keep my  covenant, then shall ye be my own possession out of all the  peoples -- for all the earth is mine --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> and ye shall be to me a kingdom of priests, and a holy  nation. These are the words which thou shalt speak to the  children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> And Moses came and called the elders of the people, and  laid before the mall these words which Jehovah had commanded  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And all the people answered together, and said, All that  Jehovah has spoken will we do! And Moses brought the words of  the people back to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Lo, I will come to thee in the  cloud's thick darkness, that the people may hear when I speak  with thee, and believe thee also for ever. And Moses told the  words of the people to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go to the people, and hallow  them to-day and to-morrow, and let them wash their clothes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> and let them be ready for the third day; for on the third  day Jehovah will come down before the eyes of all the people on  mount Sinai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> And set bounds round about the people, saying, Take heed  to yourselves, [not] to go up unto the mountain nor touch the  border of it: whatever toucheth the mountain shall certainly be  put to death:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> not a hand shall touch it, but it shall certainly be  stoned, or shot through; whether it be a beast or a man, it  shall not live. When the long drawn note of the trumpet  soundeth, they shall come up to the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And Moses came down from the mountain to the people, and  hallowed the people; and they washed their clothes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> And he said to the people, Be ready for the third day; do  not come near [your] wives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:16">19:16</a> And it came to pass on the third day, when it was morning,  that there were thunders and lightnings and a heavy cloud on  the mountain, and the sound of the trumpet exceeding loud; and  the whole people that was in the camp trembled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:17">19:17</a> And Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet with  God; and they stood at the foot of the mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:18">19:18</a> And the whole of mount Sinai smoked, because Jehovah  descended on it in fire; and its smoke ascended as the smoke of  a furnace; and the whole mountain shook greatly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:19">19:19</a> And the sound of the trumpet increased and became  exceeding loud; Moses spoke, and God answered him by a voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:20">19:20</a> And Jehovah came down on mount Sinai, on the top of the  mountain; and Jehovah called Moses to the top of the mountain,  and Moses went up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:21">19:21</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Go down, testify to the people  that they break not through to Jehovah to gaze, and many of  them perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:22">19:22</a> And the priests also, who come near to Jehovah, shall  hallow themselves, lest Jehovah break forth on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:23">19:23</a> And Moses said to Jehovah, The people cannot come up to  mount Sinai; for thou hast testified to us, saying, Set bounds  about the mountain, and hallow it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:24">19:24</a> And Jehovah said to him, Go, descend, and thou shalt come  up, thou, and Aaron with thee; but the priests and the people  shall not break through to go up to Jehovah, lest he break  forth on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:25">19:25</a> So Moses went down to the people, and told them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And God spoke all these words, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> I am Jehovah thy God, who have brought thee out of the land  of Egypt, out of the house of bondage.</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them;  for I, Jehovah thy God, am a jealous ùGod, visiting the  iniquity of the fathers upon the sons to the third and to the  fourth [generation] of them that hate me,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> and shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and  keep my commandments.</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> For in six days Jehovah made the heavens and the earth,  the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh  day; therefore Jehovah blessed the sabbath day, and hallowed  it.</p>

 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> And it came to pass, when he came near the camp, and saw  the calf and the dancing, that Moses' anger burned, and he cast  the tables out of his hands, and shattered them beneath the  mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> And he took the calf that they had made, and burned [it]  with fire, and ground it to powder, and strewed [it] on the  water, and made the children of Israel drink [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> And Moses said to Aaron, What has this people done to  thee, that thou hast brought so great a sin on them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> And Aaron said, Let not the anger of my lord burn! thou  knowest the people, that they are [set] on mischief.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> And they said to me, Make us a god, who will go before us;  for this Moses, the man that has brought us up out of the land  of Egypt, we do not know what is become of him!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> And I said to them, Who has gold? They broke [it] off, and  gave [it] me, and I cast it into the fire, and there came out  this calf.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> And Moses saw the people how they were stripped; for Aaron  had stripped them to [their] shame before their adversaries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> And Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, He that  is for Jehovah, [let him come] to me. And all the sons of Levi  gathered to him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> And he said to them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of  Israel: Put every man his sword upon his hip; go and return  from gate to gate through the camp, and slay every man his  brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> And the sons of Levi did according to the word of Moses;  and there fell of the people that day about three thousand men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> And Moses said, Consecrate yourselves to-day to Jehovah,  yea, every man with his son, and with his brother, and bring on  yourselves a blessing to-day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> And it came to pass the next day, that Moses said to the  people, Ye have sinned a great sin. And now I will go up to  Jehovah: perhaps I shall make atonement for your sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> And Moses returned to Jehovah, and said, Alas, this people  has sinned a great sin, and they have made themselves a god of  gold!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> And now, if thou wilt forgive their sin ... but if not,  blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book that thou hast written.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Whoever hath sinned against me,  him will I blot out of my book.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> And now go, lead the people whither I have told thee:  behold, my Angel shall go before thee; but in the day of my  visiting I will visit their sin upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> And Jehovah smote the people, because they made the calf,  which Aaron had made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Depart, go up hence, thou and  the people that thou hast brought up out of the land of Egypt,  into the land that I swore unto Abraham, to Isaac, and to  Jacob, saying, Unto thy seed will I give it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> (and I will send an angel before thee, and dispossess the  Canaanite, the Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, the  Hivite, and the Jebusite,)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> into a land flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go  up in the midst of thee, for thou art a stiff-necked people, --  lest I consume thee on the way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> And when the people heard this evil word, they mourned; and  no man put on his ornaments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> Now Jehovah had said to Moses, Say unto the children of  Israel, Ye are a stiff-necked people: in one moment I will come  up into the midst of thee and will consume thee. And now put  off thine ornaments from thee, and I will know what I will do  unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> And the children of Israel stripped themselves of their  ornaments at mount Horeb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> And Moses took the tent, and pitched it outside the camp,  far from the camp, and called it the Tent of meeting. And it  came to pass [that] every one who sought Jehovah went out to  the tent of meeting which was outside the camp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> And it came to pass, when Moses went out to the tent, all  the people rose up, and stood every man at the entrance of his  tent, and they looked after Moses until he entered into the  tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And it came to pass when Moses entered into the tent, the  pillar of cloud descended, and stood at the entrance of the  tent, and [Jehovah] talked with Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> And all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the  entrance of the tent; and all the people rose and worshipped,  every man at the entrance of his tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> And Jehovah spoke with Moses face to face, as a man speaks  with his friend. And he returned to the camp; but his  attendant, Joshua the son of Nun, a young man, departed not  from within the tent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> And Moses said to Jehovah, Behold, thou sayest unto me,  Bring up this people; but thou dost not let me know whom thou  wilt send with me; and thou hast said, I know thee by name, and  thou hast also found grace in mine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> And now, if indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, make  me now to know thy way, that I may know thee, that I may find  grace in thine eyes; and consider that this nation is thy  people!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> And he said, My presence shall go, and I will give thee  rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> And he said to him, If thy presence do not go, bring us  not up hence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> And how shall it be known then that I have found grace in  thine eyes -- I and thy people? [Is it] not by thy going with  us? so shall we be distinguished, I and thy people, from every  people that is on the face of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, I will do this thing also that  thou hast said; for thou hast found grace in mine eyes, and I  know thee by name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> And he said, Let me, I pray thee, see thy glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> And he said, I will make all my goodness pass before thy  face, and I will proclaim the name of Jehovah before thee; and  I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and I will shew  mercy on whom I will shew mercy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> And he said, Thou canst not see my face; for Man shall not  see me, and live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> And Jehovah said, Behold, [there is] a place by me: there  shalt thou stand on the rock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> And it shall come to pass, when my glory passeth by, that  I will put thee in a cleft of the rock, and will cover thee  with my hand, until I have passed by.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> And I will take away my hand, and thou shalt see me from  behind; but my face shall not be seen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Hew for thyself two tables of  stone like the first; and I will write upon the tables the  words that were upon the first tables, which thou hast broken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> And be ready for the morning, and go up in the morning to  mount Sinai, and stand there before me on the top of the  mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> And let no man go up with thee, neither shall any man be  seen on all the mountain; neither shall sheep and oxen feed in  front of that mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> And he hewed two tables of stone like the first; and Moses  rose up early in the morning and went up to mount Sinai, as  Jehovah had commanded him, and took in his hand the two tables  of stone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> And Jehovah came down in the cloud, and stood beside him  there, and proclaimed the name of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> And Jehovah passed by before his face, and proclaimed,  Jehovah, Jehovah ùGod merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and  abundant in goodness and truth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> keeping mercy unto thousands, forgiving iniquity and  transgression and sin, but by no means clearing [the guilty];  visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children, and  upon the children's children, upon the third and upon the  fourth [generation].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> And Moses made haste, and bowed his head to the earth and  worshipped,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> and said, If indeed I have found grace in thine eyes, Lord,  let the Lord, I pray thee, go in our midst; for it is a  stiff-necked people; and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and  take us for an inheritance!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> And he said, Behold, I make a covenant: before all thy  people I will do marvels that have not been done in all the  earth, nor in any nation; and all the people in the midst of  which thou [art] shall see the work of Jehovah; for a terrible  thing it shall be that I will do with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> Observe what I command thee this day: behold, I will drive  out before thee the Amorite, and the Canaanite, and the  Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Hivite, and the Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> Take heed to thyself, that thou make no covenant with the  inhabitants of the land to which thou shalt come, lest it be a  snare in the midst of thee;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> but ye shall demolish their altars, shatter their statues,  and hew down their Asherahs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> For thou shalt worship no other ùGod; for Jehovah --  Jealous is his name -- is a jealous ùGod;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> lest thou make a covenant with the inhabitants of the  land, and then, when they go a whoring after their gods, and  sacrifice unto their gods, thou be invited, and eat of their  sacrifice,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:16">34:16</a> and thou take of their daughters unto thy sons, and their  daughters go a whoring after their gods, and make thy sons go a  whoring after their gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> -- Thou shalt make thyself no molten gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> -- The feast of the unleavened bread shalt thou keep:  seven days shalt thou eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded  thee, at the appointed time of the month Abib; for in the month  Abib thou camest out from Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> -- All that openeth the womb [is] mine; and all the cattle  that is born a male, the firstling of ox and sheep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> But the firstling of an ass thou shalt ransom with a lamb;  and if thou ransom [it] not, then shalt thou break its neck.  All the first-born of thy sons thou shalt ransom; and none  shall appear before me empty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> -- Six days shalt thou work, but on the seventh day thou  shalt rest; in ploughing time and in harvest thou shalt rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:22">34:22</a> -- And thou shalt observe the feast of weeks, of the  first-fruits of wheat-harvest, and the feast of ingathering at  the turn of the year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:23">34:23</a> Thrice in the year shall all thy males appear before the  Lord Jehovah, the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:24">34:24</a> For I will dispossess the nations before thee, and enlarge  thy border, and no man shall desire thy land, when thou goest  up to appear before the face of Jehovah thy God thrice in the  year.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:25">34:25</a> -- Thou shalt not offer the blood of my sacrifice with  leaven; neither shall the sacrifice of the feast of the  passover be left over night until the morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:26">34:26</a> -- The first of the first-fruits of thy land shalt thou  bring into the house of Jehovah thy God. Thou shalt not boil a  kid in its mother's milk.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:27">34:27</a> And Jehovah said to Moses, Write thee these words; for  after the tenor of these words have I made a covenant with thee  and with Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:28">34:28</a> -- And he was there with Jehovah forty days and forty  nights; he ate no bread, and drank no water. -- And he wrote on  the tables the words of the covenant, the ten words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:29">34:29</a> And it came to pass, when Moses came down from mount Sinai  -- and the two tables of testimony were in Moses' hand, when he  came down from the mountain -- that Moses knew not that the  skin of his face shone through his talking with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:30">34:30</a> And Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, and  behold, the skin of his face shone; and they were afraid to  come near him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:31">34:31</a> And Moses called to them; and they turned to him, -- Aaron  and all the principal men of the assembly; and Moses talked  with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:32">34:32</a> And afterwards, all the children of Israel came near; and  he gave them in commandment all that Jehovah had spoken with  him on mount Sinai.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:33">34:33</a> And Moses ended speaking with them; and he had put on his  face a veil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:34">34:34</a> And when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him,  he took the veil off, until he came out; and he came out, and  spoke to the children of Israel what he was commanded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:35">34:35</a> And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses, that the  skin of Moses' face shone; and Moses put the veil on his face  again, until he went in to speak with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> And Moses collected all the assembly of the children of  Israel, and said to them, These are the things which Jehovah  has commanded, to do them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day there  shall be to you a holy day, a sabbath of rest to Jehovah:  whoever does work on it shall be put to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> Ye shall kindle no fire throughout your dwellings upon the  sabbath day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> And Moses spoke to all the assembly of the children of  Israel, saying, This is the word which Jehovah has commanded,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> Take from among you a heave-offering to Jehovah: every one  whose heart [is] willing, let him bring it, Jehovah's  heave-offering -- gold, and silver, and copper,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> and blue, and purple, and scarlet, and byssus, and goats'  [hair],</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a> and rams' skins dyed red, and badgers' skins, and  acacia-wood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> and oil for the light, and spices for the anointing oil,  and for the incense of fragrant drugs;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> and onyx stones, and stones to be set for the ephod, and  for the breastplate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> And all who are wise-hearted among you shall come and make  all that Jehovah has commanded:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a> the tabernacle, its tent, and its covering, its clasps,  and its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its bases;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> the ark, and its staves; the mercy-seat, and the veil of  separation;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> the table and its staves, and all its utensils, and the  shewbread;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a> and the lamp-stand for the light, and its utensils, and  its lamps, and the oil for the light;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> and the altar of incense, and its staves; and the  anointing-oil, and the incense of fragrant drugs; and the  entrance-curtain at the entrance of the tabernacle;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a> the altar of burnt-offering, and the copper grating for  it, its staves, and all its utensils; the laver and its stand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:17">35:17</a> the hangings of the court, its pillars, and its bases, and  the curtains of the gate of the court;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:18">35:18</a> the pegs of the tabernacle, and the pegs of the court, and  their cords;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:19">35:19</a> the garments of service, to do service in the sanctuary,  the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his  sons, to serve as priests.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:20">35:20</a> And all the assembly of the children of Israel departed  from before Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:21">35:21</a> And they came, every one whose heart moved him, and every  one whose spirit prompted him; they brought Jehovah's  heave-offering for the work of the tent of meeting, and for all  its service, and for the holy garments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:22">35:22</a> And they came, both men and women; every one who was of  willing heart brought nose-rings, and earrings, and rings, and  bracelets, all kinds of utensils of gold: every man that waved  a wave-offering of gold to Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:23">35:23</a> And every man with whom was found blue, and purple, and  scarlet, and byssus, and goats' [hair], and rams' skins dyed  red, and badgers' skins, brought [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:24">35:24</a> All they that offered a heave-offering of silver and  copper brought Jehovah's heave-offering. And every one with  whom was found acacia-wood for all manner of work of the  service, brought [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:25">35:25</a> And every woman that was wise-hearted spun with her hands,  and brought what she had spun: the blue, and the purple, and  the scarlet, and the byssus.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:26">35:26</a> And all the women whose heart moved them in wisdom spun  goats' [hair].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:27">35:27</a> And the principal men brought the onyx stones, and the  stones to be set, for the ephod, and for the breastplate;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:28">35:28</a> and the spice, and the oil for the light, and for the  anointing oil, and for the incense of fragrant drugs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:29">35:29</a> The children of Israel brought a voluntary offering to  Jehovah, every man and woman whose heart prompted them to bring  for all manner of work, which Jehovah, by the hand of Moses,  had commanded to be done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:30">35:30</a> And Moses said to the children of Israel, See, Jehovah has  called by name Bezaleel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the  tribe of Judah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:31">35:31</a> and he has filled him with the spirit of God, in wisdom,  in understanding, and in knowledge, and in all manner of  workmanship,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:32">35:32</a> and to devise artistic things: to work in gold, and in  silver, and in copper,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:33">35:33</a> and in cutting of stones, for setting, and in carving of  wood, to execute all artistic work;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:34">35:34</a> and he has put in his heart to teach, he and Aholiab, the  son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:35">35:35</a> he has filled them with wisdom of heart, to work all  manner of work of the engraver, and of the artificer, and of  the embroiderer, in blue, and in purple, in scarlet, and in  byssus, and of the weaver, [even] of them that do every kind of  work, and of those that devise artistic work</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> Then wrought Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every man that was  wise-hearted, in whom Jehovah had put wisdom and understanding  to know how to work all manner of work of the service of the  sanctuary -- according to all that Jehovah had commanded.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> And Moses called Bezaleel and Aholiab, and every man that  was wise-hearted, in whose heart God had put wisdom, every one  whose heart moved him to come to the work to do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> And they took from Moses every heave-offering that the  children of Israel had brought for the work of the service of  the sanctuary, to make it. And they still brought him voluntary  offerings morning by morning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> And all the wise men that wrought all the work of the  sanctuary came, every man from his work which they wrought,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> and spoke to Moses, saying, The people bring much more than  enough for the service of the work that Jehovah commanded to be  done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> Then Moses gave commandment, and they caused it to be  proclaimed through the camp, saying, Let neither man nor woman  make any more work for the heave-offering of the sanctuary! So  the people were restrained from bringing;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> for the work they had was sufficient for all the work to do  it, and it was too much.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> And every wise-hearted man among those that wrought the  work of the tabernacle made ten curtains of twined byssus, and  blue, and purple, and scarlet: [with] cherubim of artistic work  did he make them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> The length of one curtain was twenty-eight cubits, and the  breadth of one curtain four cubits -- one measure for all the  curtains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> And he coupled five of the curtains one to another, and  [the other] five curtains coupled he one to another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> And he made loops of blue on the edge of one curtain at  the edge of the coupling; he did likewise in the edge of the  outermost curtain in the other coupling.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> He made fifty loops in one curtain, and he made fifty  loops at the end of the curtain that was in the other coupling:  the loops were opposite to one another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> And he made fifty clasps of gold, and coupled the curtains  together with the clasps, so that the tabernacle became one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:14">36:14</a> And he made curtains of goats' [hair] for the tent over  the tabernacle: eleven curtains did he make them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:15">36:15</a> The length of one curtain was thirty cubits, and four  cubits the breadth of one curtain -- one measure for the eleven  curtains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:16">36:16</a> And he coupled five of the curtains by themselves, and six  of the curtains by themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> And he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost  curtain in the coupling, and fifty loops made he on the edge of  the curtain in the other coupling.</p>

 <p><a name="an_40:18">40:18</a> And Moses set up the tabernacle, and put in its bases, and  fixed its boards, and put in its bars, and set up its pillars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:19">40:19</a> And he spread the tent over the tabernacle, and put the  covering of the tent above over it; as Jehovah had commanded  Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:20">40:20</a> And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and put  the staves in the ark, and put the mercy-seat above on the ark.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:21">40:21</a> And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and hung up  the veil of separation, and covered the ark of the testimony;  as Jehovah had commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:22">40:22</a> And he put the table in the tent of meeting, on the side  of the tabernacle northward, outside the veil,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:23">40:23</a> and arranged the bread in order upon it before Jehovah; as  Jehovah had commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:24">40:24</a> And he put the candlestick in the tent of meeting,  opposite to the table, on the side of the tabernacle southward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:25">40:25</a> And he lighted the lamps before Jehovah; as Jehovah had  commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:26">40:26</a> And he put the golden altar in the tent of meeting before  the veil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:27">40:27</a> And he burnt on it fragrant incense; as Jehovah had  commanded Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:28">40:28</a> And he hung up the curtain of the entrance to the  tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:29">40:29</a> And he put the altar of burnt-offering at the entrance to  the tabernacle of the tent of meeting, and offered on it the  burnt-offering and the oblation; as Jehovah had commanded  Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:30">40:30</a> And he set the laver between the tent of meeting and the  altar, and put water in it for washing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:31">40:31</a> And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and  their feet out of it:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:32">40:32</a> when they went into the tent of meeting, and when they  drew near to the altar, they washed; as Jehovah had commanded  Moses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:33">40:33</a> And he set up the court round about the tabernacle and the  altar, and hung up the curtain of the gate of the court. And so  Moses finished the work.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:34">40:34</a> And the cloud covered the tent of meeting, and the glory  of Jehovah filled the tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:35">40:35</a> And Moses could not enter into the tent of meeting, for  the cloud abode on it, and the glory of Jehovah filled the  tabernacle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:36">40:36</a> And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle,  the children of Israel journeyed in all their journeys.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:37">40:37</a> And if the cloud were not taken up, then they did not  journey until the day that it was taken up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:38">40:38</a> For the cloud of Jehovah was on the tabernacle by day, and  fire was in it by night, before the eyes of all the house of  Israel, throughout all their journeys.</p>
