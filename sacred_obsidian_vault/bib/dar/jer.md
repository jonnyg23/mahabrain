  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Jeremiah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkijah, of the priests  that were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> to whom the word of Jehovah came in the days of Josiah the  son of Amon, king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his  reign;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> it came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,  king of Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah  the son of Josiah, king of Judah, unto the carrying away of  Jerusalem captive, in the fifth month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before  thou camest forth out of the womb I hallowed thee, I appointed  thee a prophet unto the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! behold, I cannot speak; for  I am a child.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> But Jehovah said unto me, Say not, I am a child; for thou  shalt go to whomsoever I shall send thee, and whatsoever I  command thee thou shalt speak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> Be not afraid of them; for I am with thee to deliver thee,  saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And Jehovah put forth his hand and touched my mouth; and  Jehovah said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the  kingdoms, to pluck up, and to break down, and to destroy, and  to overthrow, to build and to plant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, Jeremiah, what  seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond-tree.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Thou hast well seen; for I am  watchful over my word to perform it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And the word of Jehovah came to me the second time, saying,  What seest thou? And I said, I see a seething-pot, and its face  is from the north.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Out of the north shall evil break  forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> For behold, I am calling all the families of the kingdoms  of the north, saith Jehovah, and they shall come, and they  shall set every one his throne at the entering of the gates of  Jerusalem, and against all the walls thereof round about, and  against all the cities of Judah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> and I will pronounce my judgments against them for all  their wickedness, in that they have forsaken me, and have  burned incense unto other gods, and worshipped the works of  their own hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Thou, therefore, gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak  unto them all that I shall command thee: be not dismayed at  them, lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And I, behold, I appoint thee this day as a strong city,  and an iron pillar, and brazen walls, against the whole land;  against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its  priests, and against the people of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And they shall fight against thee, but they shall not  prevail against thee: for I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to  deliver thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith  Jehovah: I remember for thee the kindness of thy youth, the  love of thine espousals, when thou wentest after me in the  wilderness, in a land not sown.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> Israel was holiness unto Jehovah, the first-fruits of his  increase: all that devour him are guilty; evil shall come upon  them, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> Hear the word of Jehovah, house of Jacob, and all the  families of the house of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> Thus saith Jehovah: What injustice have your fathers found  in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after  vanity, and become vain?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> And they said not, Where is Jehovah, that brought us up out  of the land of Egypt, that led us in the wilderness, in a land  of deserts and of pits, in a land of drought and of the shadow  of death, in a land that no one passeth through, and where no  man dwelleth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And I brought you into a fruitful land, to eat the fruit  thereof and the good thereof; and ye entered and defiled my  land, and made my heritage an abomination.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> The priests said not, Where is Jehovah? and they that  handled the law knew me not; and the shepherds transgressed  against me; and the prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked  after [things that] do not profit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> Therefore will I yet plead with you, saith Jehovah, and with  your children's children will I plead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> For pass over to the isles of Chittim, and see; and send  unto Kedar, and consider diligently, and see if there have been  such a thing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> Hath a nation changed [its] gods? and they are no gods; --  but my people have changed their glory for that which doth not  profit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, and shudder; be amazed  very much, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> For my people have committed two evils: they have forsaken  me, the fountain of living waters, to hew them out cisterns,  broken cisterns that hold no water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> Is Israel a bondman? Is he a home-born [slave]? Why is he  become a spoil?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> The young lions roared against him, they gave forth their  voice, and they made his land desolate: his cities are burned,  without inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> Even the children of Noph and Tahapanes have fed on the  crown of thy head.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast  forsaken Jehovah thy God, at the time he was leading thee in  the way?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> And now, what hast thou to do with the way of Egypt, to  drink the waters of Shihor? And what hast thou to do with the  way of Assyria, to drink the waters of the River?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> Thine own wickedness chastiseth thee, and thy backslidings  reprove thee: know then and see that it is an evil thing and  bitter that thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God, and that my  fear is not in thee, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> For of old thou hast broken thy yoke, [and] burst thy  bands; and thou saidst, I will not serve. For upon every high  hill, and under every green tree, thou bowest down, playing the  harlot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> And I, -- I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right  seed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate shoots of a  strange vine unto me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much  potash, thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:23">2:23</a> How sayest thou, I am not defiled, I have not gone after  the Baals? See thy way in the valley, acknowledge what thou  hast done -- a swift dromedary traversing her ways!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:24">2:24</a> -- a wild ass, used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the  wind in her desire! In her ardour, who shall turn her away? All  they that seek her will not weary themselves; in her month they  shall find her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:25">2:25</a> Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from  thirst. But thou saidst, There is no hope; no, for I love  strangers, and after them will I go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:26">2:26</a> As a thief is ashamed when he is found, so shall the house  of Israel be ashamed -- they, their kings, their princes, and  their priests, and their prophets --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:27">2:27</a> saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou  hast brought me forth; for they have turned the back unto me,  and not the face; and in the time of their trouble they will  say, Arise, and save us!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:28">2:28</a> Where then are thy gods that thou hast made for thyself?  let them arise, if they can save thee in the time of thy  trouble: for as the number of thy cities, are thy gods, O  Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:29">2:29</a> Wherefore would ye contend with me? Ye all have  transgressed against me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:30">2:30</a> In vain have I smitten your children: they received no  correction. Your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a  destroying lion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:31">2:31</a> O generation, mark ye the word of Jehovah. Have I been a  wilderness unto Israel, or a land of thick darkness? Wherefore  say my people, We have dominion; we will come no more unto  thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:32">2:32</a> Doth a virgin forget her ornaments, a bride her attire? But  my people have forgotten me days without number.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:33">2:33</a> How dost thou trim thy way to seek love! Therefore hast  thou also accustomed thy ways to wickedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:34">2:34</a> Yea, in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the  innocent poor, whom thou didst not encounter breaking in, but  [it is found] upon all these.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:35">2:35</a> And thou sayest, Indeed I am innocent; his anger will turn  from me. Behold, I will enter into judgment with thee because  thou sayest, I have not sinned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:36">2:36</a> Why dost thou gad about so much, and change thy way? Thou  shalt also be brought to shame by Egypt, as thou wast brought  to shame by Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:37">2:37</a> Thou shalt indeed go forth from her with thy hands upon thy  head; for Jehovah hath rejected those thou confidest in, and  thou shalt not prosper by them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him,  and become another man's, shall he return unto her again? Would  not that land be utterly polluted? But thou hast committed  fornication with many lovers; yet return to me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> Lift up thine eyes unto the heights and see, where hast thou  not been lain with? In the ways hast thou sat for them, as an  Arab in the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with  thy fornications and with thy wickedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no  latter rain; but thou hast a harlot's forehead, thou refusest  to be ashamed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou  art the guide of my youth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> Will he keep [his anger] for ever? Will he preserve it  perpetually? Behold, thou hast spoken and hast done evil  things, and thou art [so] determined.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And Jehovah said unto me in the days of Josiah the king,  Hast thou seen what backsliding Israel hath done? She hath gone  up upon every high mountain and under every green tree, and  there hath committed fornication.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> And I said, After she hath done all these [things], she will  return unto me; but she returned not. And her sister Judah, the  treacherous, saw [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> And I saw that when for all the causes wherein backsliding  Israel committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a  bill of divorce, yet the treacherous Judah, her sister, feared  not, but went and committed fornication also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> And it came to pass through the lightness of her fornication  that she polluted the land, and committed adultery with stones  and with stocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> And even for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not  returned unto me with her whole heart, but with falsehood,  saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Backsliding Israel hath shewn  herself more just than treacherous Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say,  Return, thou backsliding Israel, saith Jehovah: I will not make  my face dark upon you; for I am merciful, saith Jehovah; I will  not keep [anger] for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast  transgressed against Jehovah thy God, and hast turned thy ways  hither and thither to the strangers under every green tree; and  ye have not hearkened to my voice, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Return, backsliding children, saith Jehovah; for I am a  husband unto you, and I will take you, one of a city, and two  of a family, and I will bring you to Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> And I will give you shepherds according to my heart, and  they shall feed you with knowledge and understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And it shall come to pass, when ye are multiplied in the  land and become fruitful, in those days, saith Jehovah, they  shall say no more, Ark of the covenant of Jehovah! neither  shall it come to mind, nor shall they remember it, nor shall  they visit [it]; neither shall it be done any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of  Jehovah; and all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the  name of Jehovah, to Jerusalem; and they shall no more walk  after the stubbornness of their evil heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house  of Israel; and they shall come together out of the land of the  north, to the land which I caused your fathers to inherit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> And as for me, I said, How shall I put thee among the  children, and give thee the pleasant land, the goodly  inheritance of the hosts of the nations? And I said, Thou shalt  call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from following me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> Surely [as] a woman treacherously departeth from her  companion, so have ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of  Israel, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> A voice is heard upon the heights, the weeping  supplications of the children of Israel; for they have  perverted their way, they have forgotten Jehovah their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> -- Return, backsliding children; I will heal your  backslidings. ... Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art  Jehovah our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> Truly in vain [is salvation looked for] from the hills,  [and] the multitude of mountains; truly in Jehovah our God is  the salvation of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> But shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our  youth; their flocks and their herds, their sons and their  daughters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us;  for we have sinned against Jehovah our God, we and our fathers,  from our youth even unto this day, and have not hearkened to  the voice of Jehovah our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith Jehovah, return unto  me; and if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my  sight, then shalt thou not be a wanderer;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> -- and thou shalt in truth, in justice, and in righteousness  swear, [As] Jehovah liveth! and the nations shall bless  themselves in him, and in him shall they glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> For thus saith Jehovah to the men of Judah and Jerusalem:  Break up for you a fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> Circumcise yourselves for Jehovah, and take away the  foreskins of your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of  Jerusalem; lest my fury come forth like fire and burn, and  there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> Declare ye in Judah, and cause it to be heard in Jerusalem,  and say, ... and blow the trumpet in the land, cry aloud and  say, Assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the fenced  cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> Set up a banner toward Zion; take to flight, stay not! For I  am bringing evil from the north, and a great destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> The lion is come up from his thicket, the destroyer of the  nations is on his way; he is gone forth from his place, to make  thy land desolate; thy cities shall be laid waste, without  inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> For this, gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl! for the  fierce anger of Jehovah is not turned away from us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah, that  the heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the  princes; and the priests shall be astonished, and the prophets  shall be amazed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! surely thou hast greatly  deceived this people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have  peace; whereas the sword reacheth unto the soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> At that time shall it be said to this people and to  Jerusalem, A hot wind [cometh] from the heights in the  wilderness, on the way of the daughter of my people, not for  fanning, nor for cleansing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> A wind more vehement than that shall come from me: now will  I also pronounce judgments against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> Behold, he cometh up as clouds, and his chariots are as a  whirlwind; his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for  we are destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> Wash thy heart, Jerusalem, from wickedness, that thou  mayest be saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within  thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:15">4:15</a> For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction  from mount Ephraim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:16">4:16</a> Inform the nations; behold, make Jerusalem to hear:  Besiegers come from a far country, and raise their voice  against the cities of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:17">4:17</a> As keepers of a field are they against her round about; for  she hath been rebellious against me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:18">4:18</a> Thy way and thy doings have procured these [things] unto  thee; this is thy wickedness, yea, it is bitter, yea, it  reacheth unto thy heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:19">4:19</a> My bowels! my bowels! I am in travail! [Oh,] the walls of  my heart! My heart maketh a noise in me; I cannot hold my  peace: for thou hearest, my soul, the sound of the trumpet, the  clamour of war.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:20">4:20</a> Destruction upon destruction is proclaimed; for the whole  land is wasted: suddenly are my tents laid waste, my curtains,  in a moment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:21">4:21</a> How long shall I see the standard, [and] hear the sound of  the trumpet?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:22">4:22</a> For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are  sottish children, and they have no intelligence; they are wise  to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:23">4:23</a> I beheld the earth, and lo, it was waste and empty; and the  heavens, and they had no light.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:24">4:24</a> I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled, and all the  hills shook violently.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:25">4:25</a> I beheld, and lo, man was not, and all the fowl of the  heavens were fled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:26">4:26</a> I beheld, and lo, the fruitful land was a wilderness, and  all the cities thereof were broken down, before Jehovah, before  his fierce anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:27">4:27</a> For thus saith Jehovah: The whole land shall be a  desolation; but I will not make a full end.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:28">4:28</a> For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be  black; because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will  not repent, neither will I turn back therefrom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:29">4:29</a> At the noise of the horsemen and bowmen, every city fleeth;  they go into the thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every  city is forsaken and no man dwelleth therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:30">4:30</a> -- And thou, wasted one, what wilt thou do? Though thou  clothest thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with  ornaments of gold, though thou rendest thine eyes with paint,  in vain dost thou make thyself fair: [thy] lovers despise thee,  they seek thy life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:31">4:31</a> For I hear a voice, as of a woman in travail, anguish as of  her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the  daughter of Zion: she moaneth, she spreadeth forth her hands,  [saying], Woe unto me! for my soul faileth because of  murderers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see  now, and know, and seek in the broadways thereof, if ye can  find a man, if there be [any] that doeth justice, that seeketh  fidelity; and I will pardon it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And if they say, [As] Jehovah liveth! surely they swear  falsely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> Jehovah, are not thine eyes upon fidelity? Thou hast smitten  them, but they are not sore; thou hast consumed them, they have  refused to receive correction: they have made their faces  harder than a rock; they have refused to return.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> And I said, Surely these are the wretched ones, they are  foolish; for they know not the way of Jehovah, the judgment of  their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> I will go unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for  they know the way of Jehovah, the judgment of their God; but  these have altogether broken the yoke, have burst the bonds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> Therefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, a wolf  of the evenings shall waste them; the leopard lurketh against  their cities, every one that goeth out thence is torn in  pieces: for their transgressions are multiplied, their  backslidings are increased.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> Wherefore should I pardon thee? Thy children have forsaken  me, and swear by them that are not God. I have satiated them,  and they have committed adultery, and they troop to the  harlots' house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> [As] well fed horses, they roam about, every one neigheth  after his neighbour's wife.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah, and shall  not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Go up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end;  take away her battlements, for they are not Jehovah's.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt  very treacherously against me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> They have denied Jehovah, and say, He is not; and evil  shall not come upon us, nor shall we see sword nor famine;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> and the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in  them: thus shall it be done unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts: Because ye  speak this word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth  fire, and this people wood, and it shall devour them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> Behold, I bring a nation upon you from afar, house of  Israel, saith Jehovah: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient  nation, a nation whose language thou knowest not, neither  understandest thou what they say.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> Their quiver is as an open sepulchre; they are all mighty  men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And they shall eat up thy harvest and thy bread, they shall  eat up thy sons and thy daughters, they shall eat up thy flocks  and thy herds, they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig-trees;  they shall destroy with the sword thy strong cities, wherein  thou trustedst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Nevertheless in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make  a full end with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore  hath Jehovah our God done all these things unto us? then shalt  thou say to them, As ye have forsaken me, and served strange  gods in your land, so shall ye serve strangers in a land that  is not yours.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in  Judah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> Hear now this, O foolish and heartless people, who have  eyes and see not; who have ears, and hear not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> Will ye not fear me? saith Jehovah. Will ye not tremble at  my presence, who have set the sand a bound for the sea by a  perpetual decree, and it shall not pass it? and its waves toss  themselves, but they do not prevail; and they roar, yet can  they not pass over it?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> But this people hath a stubborn and a rebellious heart;  they have turned aside and are gone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> And they say not in their heart, Let us now fear Jehovah  our God, that giveth rain, both the early and the latter, in  its season; who preserveth unto us the appointed weeks of  harvest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your  sins have withholden from you what is good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> For among my people are found wicked [men]: they lay wait,  as fowlers stoop down; they set a trap, they catch men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> As a cage full of birds, so are their houses full of  deceit: therefore they are become great, and have enriched  themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> They are become fat, they shine, yea, they surpass in deeds  of wickedness; they judge not the cause, the cause of the  fatherless, and they prosper; and the right of the needy do  they not adjudge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> Shall I not visit for these things? saith Jehovah; shall  not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> An appalling and horrible thing is committed in the land:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:31">5:31</a> the prophets prophesy falsehood, and the priests rule by  their means; and my people love [to have it] so. But what will  ye do in the end thereof?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> Flee for safety, ye children of Benjamin, out of the midst  of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a  signal in Beth-haccerem; for evil appeareth out of the north,  and a great destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> The comely and delicate one do I cut off, the daughter of  Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> Shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall  pitch [their] tents against her round about; they shall feed  every one in his place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> Prepare war against her. Arise, and let us go up at noon.  Woe unto us! for the day hath declined, for the shadows of the  evening are lengthening.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> Arise, and let us go up by night, and let us destroy her  palaces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> For thus hath Jehovah of hosts said: Hew ye down trees, and  cast a mound against Jerusalem. She is the city to be visited;  she is wholly oppression in the midst of her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> As a well poureth forth her waters, so she poureth forth her  wickedness: violence and destruction are heard in her; before  me continually are grief and wounds.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> Be thou instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul be alienated  from thee; lest I make thee a desolation, a land not inhabited.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: They shall thoroughly glean  like a vine the remnant of Israel: turn back thy hand, as a  grape-gatherer unto the baskets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> To whom shall I speak and testify, that they may hear?  Behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken:  behold, the word of Jehovah is unto them a reproach; they have  no delight in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And I am full of the fury of Jehovah, I am weary with  holding in. Pour it out upon the children in the street, and  upon the assembly of young men together: for even the husband  with the wife shall be taken; the aged with him [that is] full  of days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> And their houses shall be turned unto others, [their]  fields and wives together; for I will stretch out my hand upon  the inhabitants of the land, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them,  every one is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even  unto the priest, every one dealeth falsely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And they have healed the breach of the daughter of my  people lightly, saying, Peace, peace! when there is no peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> Are they ashamed that they have committed abomination? Nay,  they are not at all ashamed, neither know they what it is to  blush. Therefore they shall fall among them that fall; at the  time that I visit them they shall stumble, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:16">6:16</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the ways and see, and ask for  the ancient paths, which is the good way, and walk therein, and  ye shall find rest for your souls. But they said, We will not  walk [therein].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:17">6:17</a> Also I have set watchmen over you: -- Hearken ye to the  sound of the trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:18">6:18</a> Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O assembly, what is  among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:19">6:19</a> Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people,  the fruit of their thoughts; for they have not hearkened unto  my words, and as to my law, they have rejected it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:20">6:20</a> To what purpose should there come to me incense from Sheba,  and the sweet cane from a far country? Your burnt-offerings are  not acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:21">6:21</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will lay  stumbling-blocks before this people, and the fathers and the  sons together shall fall over them; the neighbour and his  friend shall perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:22">6:22</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, a people cometh from the north  country, and a great nation is stirred up from the uttermost  parts of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:23">6:23</a> They lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no  mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon  horses, set in array as a man for the battle, against thee,  daughter of Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:24">6:24</a> We have heard the report thereof: our hands are grown  feeble; anguish hath taken hold of us, pain as of a woman that  travaileth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:25">6:25</a> Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for  [there is] the sword of the enemy, terror is on every side.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:26">6:26</a> Daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and roll  thyself in ashes: make mourning, [as] for an only son -- bitter  lamentation; for the spoiler cometh suddenly upon us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:27">6:27</a> I have set thee among my people as an assayer, a fortress,  that thou mayest know and try their way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:28">6:28</a> They are all the most rebellious of rebels, going about  with slander: they are bronze and iron; they are all  corrupters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:29">6:29</a> The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed by the fire;  they have melted, and melted in vain; and the bad are not  plucked away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:30">6:30</a> Reprobate silver shall they call them, for Jehovah hath  rejected them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> Stand in the gate of Jehovah's house, and proclaim there  this word, and say, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah,  that enter in at these gates to worship Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Amend your  ways and your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this  place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> Confide ye not in words of falsehood, saying, Jehovah's  temple, Jehovah's temple, Jehovah's temple is this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> But if ye thoroughly amend your ways and your doings, if ye  really do justice between a man and his neighbour,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> [if] ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the  widow, and shed no innocent blood in this place, neither walk  after other gods to your hurt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land  that I gave to your fathers from of old even for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> Behold, ye confide in words of falsehood that cannot profit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> What? steal, murder, and commit adultery, and swear falsely,  and burn incense unto Baal, and walk after other gods whom ye  know not ...</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> then ye come and stand before me, in this house which is  called by my name, and say, We are delivered, -- in order to do  all these abominations!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Is this house, which is called by my name, a den of robbers  in your eyes? Even I, behold, I have seen it, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> For go now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I  caused my name to dwell at the first, and see what I did to it,  for the wickedness of my people Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And now, because ye have done all these works, saith  Jehovah, and I spoke unto you, rising up early and speaking,  and ye heard not, and I called you, and ye answered not;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> I will even do unto the house which is called by my name,  wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to  your fathers, as I have done to Shiloh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> and I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all  your brethren, all the seed of Ephraim.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> And thou, pray not for this people, neither lift up cry nor  prayer for them, and make not intercession to me; for I will  not hear thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah, and in  the streets of Jerusalem?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire,  and the women knead dough, to make cakes to the queen of  heaven, and to pour out drink-offerings unto other gods, that  they may provoke me to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> Is it I whom they provoke to anger? saith Jehovah; is it  not themselves, to the shame of their own face?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, mine anger  and my fury shall be poured out upon this place; upon man, and  upon beast, and upon the trees of the field, and upon the fruit  of the ground; and it shall burn, and shall not be quenched.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Add your  burnt-offerings to your sacrifices, and eat the flesh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> For I spoke not unto your fathers, nor commanded them  concerning burnt-offerings and sacrifices, in the day that I  brought them out of the land of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> but I commanded them this thing, saying, Hearken unto my  voice, and I will be your God, and ye shall be my people; and  walk in all the way that I command you, that it may be well  with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked  in the counsels, in the stubbornness of their evil heart, and  went backward and not forward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land  of Egypt, unto this day, have I sent unto you all my servants  the prophets, daily rising up early and sending them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:26">7:26</a> but they have not hearkened unto me, nor inclined their  ear; and they have hardened their neck: they have done worse  than their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:27">7:27</a> And thou shalt speak all these words unto them, but they  will not hearken unto thee; and thou shalt call unto them, but  they will not answer thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:28">7:28</a> And thou shalt say unto them, This is the nation which hath  not hearkened unto the voice of Jehovah their God, nor received  correction; fidelity is perished, and is cut off from their  mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:29">7:29</a> Cut off thy hair, and cast it away, and take up a  lamentation on the heights; for Jehovah hath rejected and  forsaken the generation of his wrath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:30">7:30</a> For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith  Jehovah; they have set their abominations in the house which is  called by my name, to defile it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:31">7:31</a> And they have built the high places of Topheth, which is in  the valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their  daughters in the fire; which I commanded not, neither did it  come up into my mind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:32">7:32</a> Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith Jehovah, when it  shall no more be said, Topheth, and Valley of the son of  Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter; for they shall bury in  Topheth, till there be no place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:33">7:33</a> And the carcases of this people shall be food for the fowl  of the heavens, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall  scare [them] away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:34">7:34</a> And I will cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and  from the streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth and the voice  of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride;  for the land shall become a waste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> At that time, saith Jehovah, they shall bring forth the  bones of the kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and  the bones of the priests, and the bones of the prophets, and  the bones of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> and they shall spread them out to the sun and to the moon  and to all the host of the heavens, which they have loved, and  which they have served, and after which they have walked, and  which they have sought, and which they have worshipped: they  shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall be for dung  upon the face of the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the  residue that remain of this evil family, in all the places  whither I have driven those that remain, saith Jehovah of  hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Do [men]  fall, and not rise up? Doth one turn away, and not return?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> Why hath this people of Jerusalem slidden back with a  perpetual backsliding? They hold fast deceit, they refuse to  return.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> I hearkened and heard: they speak not what is right; there  is no man who repenteth him of his wickedness, saying, What  have I done? Every one turneth to his course, like a horse  rushing into the battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> Even a stork in the heavens knoweth her appointed times, and  the turtle-dove and the swallow and the crane observe the time  of their coming; but my people know not the judgment of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of Jehovah is with  us? Behold, certainly the lying pen of the scribes hath made it  falsehood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken:  behold, they have rejected Jehovah's word; and what wisdom is  in them?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> Therefore will I give their wives unto others, their fields  to those that shall possess [them]; for every one, from the  least even unto the greatest, is given to covetousness; from  the prophet even unto the priest, every one dealeth falsely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> And they have healed the breach of the daughter of my  people lightly, saying, Peace, peace! when there is no peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Are they ashamed that they have committed abomination? Nay,  they are not at all ashamed, and they know not how to blush.  Therefore shall they fall among them that fall: in the time of  their visitation they shall stumble, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> I will utterly take them away, saith Jehovah: there are no  grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig-tree; and the leaf is  faded: and I will give them up to those that shall pass over  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> Why do we sit still? Assemble yourselves, and let us enter  into the fenced cities, and let us be silent there: for Jehovah  our God hath put us to silence, and given us water of gall to  drink, because we have sinned against Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> Peace is looked for, and there is no good; a time of  healing, and behold, terror.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> The snorting of his horses is heard from Dan: the whole  land trembleth at the sound of the neighing of his steeds, and  they come, and devour the land, and all it contains, the city  and those that dwell therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> For behold, I send among you serpents, vipers against which  there is no charm, and they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> My comfort in my sadness! my heart is faint in me!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people,  from a very far country: Is not Jehovah in Zion? Is not her  king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their  graven images, with foreign vanities?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not  saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> -- For the breach of the daughter of my people am I  crushed; I go mourning; astonishment hath taken hold of me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there?  Why then is there no dressing applied for the healing of the  daughter of my people?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Oh that my head were waters, and mine eye a fountain of  tears, that I might weep day and night for the slain of the  daughter of my people!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> Oh that I had in the wilderness a traveller's lodging-place,  that I might leave my people, and go away from them! For they  are all adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And they bend their tongue, their bow of falsehood, and not  for fidelity are they valiant in the land; for they proceed  from evil to evil, and they know not me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Take ye heed every one of his friend, and confide not in any  brother; for every brother only supplanteth, and every friend  goeth about with slander.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> And they act deceitfully every one with his neighbour, and  speak not the truth: they teach their tongue to speak  falsehood, they weary themselves with perverse dealing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> Thy habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit  they refuse to know me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will melt  them, and try them; for how else could I do for the daughter of  my people?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> Their tongue is a murderous arrow; it speaketh deceit. [A  man] speaketh peaceably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in  his heart he layeth his ambush.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> Shall I not visit them for these [things]? saith Jehovah;  shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> For the mountains will I take up weeping and wailing, and  for the pastures of the wilderness, a lamentation; for they are  burnt up, so that none passeth through them; and the voice of  the cattle is not heard. Both the fowl of the heavens and the  beasts are fled; they are gone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And I will make Jerusalem heaps, a dwelling-place of  jackals; and I will make the cities of Judah a desolation,  without inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> Who is a wise man, that he may understand this? and he to  whom the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken, that he may declare it?  Why is the land perished, burnt up like a wilderness, so that  none passeth through?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> And Jehovah saith, Because they have forsaken my law which  I set before them, and have not hearkened unto my voice, nor  walked in it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> but have walked after the stubbornness of their own heart,  and after the Baals, as their fathers taught them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel,  Behold, I will feed this people with wormwood, and give them  water of gall to drink,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> and will scatter them among the nations, whom neither they  nor their fathers have known; and I will send the sword after  them, till I have consumed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Consider, and call for the  mourning women, that they may come, and send for the skilful  women, that they may come;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> and let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that  our eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids pour forth  waters.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we  spoiled, sorely put to shame! For we have forsaken the land,  for they have cast down our dwellings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> Hear then the word of Jehovah, ye women, and let your ear  receive the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters  wailing, and each one her companion lamentation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> For death is come up through our windows, is entered into  our palaces, to cut off the children from the street, the young  men from the broadways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:22">9:22</a> Speak, Thus saith Jehovah: Yea, the carcases of men shall  fall as dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the  reaper, and there shall be none to gather.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:23">9:23</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Let not the wise glory in his wisdom,  neither let the mighty glory in his might; let not the rich  glory in his riches:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:24">9:24</a> but let him that glorieth glory in this, that he  understandeth and knoweth me, that I [am] Jehovah, who exercise  loving-kindness, judgment, and righteousness in the earth; for  in these things I delight, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:25">9:25</a> Behold, days are coming, saith Jehovah, when I will visit  all [them that are] circumcised with the uncircumcised;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:26">9:26</a> Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and  Moab, and all that have the corners [of their beard] cut off,  that dwell in the wilderness: for all the nations are  uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel are uncircumcised in  heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Hear the word that Jehovah speaketh unto you, house of  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Learn not the way of the nations, and  be not dismayed at the signs of the heavens; for the nations  are dismayed at them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> For the statutes of the peoples are vanity; for [it is] a  tree cut out of the forest, worked with a chisel by the hands  of the artizan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> they deck it with silver and with gold; they fasten it with  nails and with hammers, that it move not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> They are as a palm-column of turned work, and they speak  not; they are carried, for they cannot go. Be not afraid of  them; for they cannot do evil, neither also is it in them to do  good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> There is none like unto thee, Jehovah; thou art great, and  thy name is great in might.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> Who would not fear thee, O King of nations? For to thee  doth it appertain; for among all the wise men of the nations,  and in all their kingdoms, there is none like unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> But they are one and all senseless and foolish; the  teaching of vanities is a stock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> Silver spread into plates is brought from Tarshish, and  gold from Uphaz, the work of the artizan and of the hands of  the founder; blue and purple is their clothing: they are all  the work of skilful [men].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> But Jehovah Elohim is truth; he is the living God, and the  King of eternity. At his wrath the earth trembleth, and the  nations cannot abide his indignation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> Thus shall ye say unto them: The gods that have not made  the heavens and the earth, these shall perish from the earth,  and from under the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> He hath made the earth by his power, he hath established  the world by his wisdom, and hath stretched out the heavens by  his understanding.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> When he uttereth his voice, there is a tumult of waters in  the heavens, and he causeth the vapours to ascend from the end  of the earth; he maketh lightnings for the rain, and bringeth  forth the wind out of his treasuries.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> Every man is become brutish, bereft of knowledge; every  founder is put to shame by the graven image, for his molten  image is falsehood, and there is no breath in them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> They are vanity, a work of delusion: in the time of their  visitation they shall perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> The portion of Jacob is not like them; for it is he that  hath formed all [things], and Israel is the rod of his  inheritance: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> Gather up thy baggage out of the land, O inhabitress of  the fortress.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will this time sling out  the inhabitants of the land, and will distress them, that they  may be found.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> Woe is me, for my wound! My stroke is hard to heal, and I  had said, Yea, this is [my] grief, and I will bear it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> My tent is despoiled, and all my cords are broken; my  children are gone forth from me, and they are not; there is  none to stretch forth my tent any more, and to set up my  curtains.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> For the shepherds are become brutish, and have not sought  Jehovah; therefore have they not acted wisely, and all their  flock is scattered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> The voice of a rumour! Behold, it cometh, and a great  commotion out of the north country, to make the cities of Judah  a desolation, a dwelling-place of jackals.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> I know, Jehovah, that the way of man is not his own; it is  not in a man that walketh to direct his steps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> Jehovah, correct me, but with judgment; not in thine  anger, lest thou bring me to nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> Pour out thy fury upon the nations that know thee not, and  upon the families that call not on thy name; for they have  eaten up Jacob, yea, they have eaten him up and consumed him,  and have laid waste his dwelling-place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Hear ye the words of this covenant; and speak ye unto the  men of Judah, and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah, the God  of Israel: Cursed be the man that obeyeth not the words of this  covenant</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> which I commanded your fathers in the day that I brought  them forth out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace,  saying, Hearken unto my voice and do them, according to all  that I command you; so shall ye be my people, and I will be  your God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> that I may perform the oath that I have sworn unto your  fathers, to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, as it  is this day. And I answered and said, Amen, Jehovah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Proclaim all these words in the  cities of Judah, and in the streets of Jerusalem, saying: Hear  the words of this covenant, and do them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> For I earnestly protested unto your fathers, in the day  that I brought them up out of the land of Egypt, unto this day,  rising early and protesting, saying, Hearken unto my voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> But they have not hearkened, nor inclined their ear, but  have walked every one in the stubbornness of their evil heart;  and I have brought upon them all the words of this covenant,  which I commanded [them] to do, and they have not done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And Jehovah said unto me, A conspiracy is found among the  men of Judah, and among the inhabitants of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> They are turned back to the iniquities of their  forefathers, who refused to hear my words; and they have gone  after other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the  house of Judah have broken my covenant which I made with their  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will bring evil  upon them, from which they shall not be able to escape; and  they will cry unto me, and I will not hearken unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> Then shall the cities of Judah and inhabitants of  Jerusalem go and cry unto the gods unto whom they have burned  incense; but they shall not save them at all in the time of  their trouble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> For [as] the number of thy cities, are thy gods, O Judah;  and [as] the number of the streets of Jerusalem, have ye set up  altars to the Shame, altars to burn incense unto Baal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> And thou, pray not for this people, neither lift up cry  nor prayer for them; for I will not hear in the time that they  cry unto me for their trouble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> What hath my beloved to do in my house, seeing that the  more part practise their evil devices, and the holy flesh is  passed from thee? When thou doest evil, then thou rejoicest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> Jehovah had called thy name, A green olive-tree, fair, of  goodly fruit: with the noise of a great tumult he hath kindled  fire upon it, and its branches are broken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> For Jehovah of hosts, that planted thee, hath pronounced  evil against thee, for the evil of the house of Israel and of  the house of Judah, which they have done for themselves, to  provoke me to anger in burning incense unto Baal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:18">11:18</a> And Jehovah hath given me knowledge, and I know [it]; then  thou shewedst me their doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:19">11:19</a> And I was like a tame lamb [that] is led to the slaughter;  and I knew not that they devised devices against me, [saying,]  Let us destroy the tree with the fruit thereof, and let us cut  him off from the land of the living, that his name may be no  more remembered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:20">11:20</a> But thou, Jehovah of hosts, who judgest righteously, who  triest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on  them: for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:21">11:21</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the men of  Anathoth, that seek thy life, saying, Prophesy not in the name  of Jehovah, that thou die not by our hand,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:22">11:22</a> -- therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I punish  them: the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and  their daughters shall die by famine;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:23">11:23</a> and there shall be no remnant of them; for I will bring  evil upon the men of Anathoth, in the year of their visitation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> Righteous art thou, Jehovah, when I plead with thee; yet  will I speak with thee of [thy] judgments. Wherefore doth the  way of the wicked prosper? [wherefore] are all they at ease  that deal very treacherously?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> Thou hast planted them, they also have taken root: they  advance, yea, they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their  mouth, but far from their reins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> But thou, Jehovah, knowest me; thou hast seen me, and  proved my heart toward thee. Drag them out like sheep for the  slaughter, and set them apart for the day of slaughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> How long shall the land mourn, and the herbs of all the  fields wither? Because of the wickedness of them that dwell  therein, the beasts and the birds perish; for they say, He will  not see our end.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> If thou hast run with footmen, and they have wearied thee,  how wilt thou then contend with horses? And if in a land of  peace thou thinkest thyself in security, how wilt thou then do  in the swelling of the Jordan?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> For even thy brethren, and the house of thy father, even  they have dealt treacherously with thee, even they have cried  aloud after thee. Believe them not, though they speak good  [words] unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> I have forsaken my house, I have cast off my heritage, I  have given the beloved of my soul into the hand of her enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> My heritage is become unto me as a lion in the forest; it  hath raised its voice against me: therefore have I hated it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> My heritage is unto me [as] a speckled bird of prey; the  birds of prey round about are against her. Go, assemble all the  beasts of the field, bring them to devour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> Many shepherds have destroyed my vineyard, they have  trodden my portion under foot, they have made my pleasant  portion a desolate wilderness:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> they have made it a desolation; desolate, it mourneth unto  me: the whole land is made desolate, for no man layeth it to  heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> Spoilers are come upon all heights in the wilderness; for  the sword of Jehovah devoureth from one end of the land even to  the [other] end of the land: no flesh hath peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> They have sown wheat, and they reap thorns; they have put  themselves to pain, [and] do not profit. Be ye therefore  ashamed of your revenues, because of the fierce anger of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> Thus saith Jehovah against all mine evil neighbours, that  touch the inheritance which I have caused my people Israel to  inherit: Behold, I will pluck them up out of their land, and  pluck out the house of Judah from among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:15">12:15</a> And it shall come to pass, after I have plucked them up, I  will return, and have compassion on them, and will bring them  back, each one to his inheritance, and each one to his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:16">12:16</a> And it shall come to pass, if they will diligently learn  the ways of my people, to swear by my name, [As] Jehovah liveth  -- even as they taught my people to swear by Baal -- they shall  be built up in the midst of my people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:17">12:17</a> And if they will not obey, I will utterly pluck up and  destroy that nation, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> Thus said Jehovah unto me: Go and buy thee a linen girdle,  and put it upon thy loins; but dip it not in water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And I bought a girdle according to the word of Jehovah, and  put it upon my loins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto me the second time,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> Take the girdle that thou hast bought, which is upon thy  loins, and arise, go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a  hole of the rock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> So I went and hid it by the Euphrates, as Jehovah had  commanded me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And it came to pass at the end of many days, that Jehovah  said unto me, Arise, go to the Euphrates, and take the girdle  from thence which I commanded thee to hide there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> And I went to the Euphrates, and digged, and took the  girdle from the place where I had hid it; and behold, the  girdle was spoiled, it was good for nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> Thus saith Jehovah: After this manner will I spoil the  pride of Judah, and the great pride of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:10">13:10</a> This evil people, who refuse to hear my words, who walk in  the stubbornness of their heart, and go after other gods, to  serve them and to worship them, shall even be as this girdle  which is good for nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:11">13:11</a> For as a girdle cleaveth to the loins of a man, so have I  caused to cleave unto me the whole house of Israel and the  whole house of Judah, saith Jehovah; that they might be unto me  for a people, and for a name, and for a praise, and for a  glory: but they would not hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:12">13:12</a> And thou shalt speak unto them this word: Thus saith  Jehovah, the God of Israel, Every skin shall be filled with  wine. And they will say unto thee, Do we not very well know  that every skin shall be filled with wine?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:13">13:13</a> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold,  I will fill all the inhabitants of this land, and the kings  that sit for David upon his throne, and the priests and the  prophets, and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, with  drunkenness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:14">13:14</a> And I will dash them one against another, both the fathers  and the sons together, saith Jehovah; I will not pity, nor  spare, nor have mercy so as not to destroy them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:15">13:15</a> Hear ye, and give ear, be not lifted up; for Jehovah hath  spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:16">13:16</a> Give glory to Jehovah your God, before he cause darkness,  and before your feet stumble upon the mountains of twilight;  and ye shall look for light, but he will turn it into the  shadow of death, and make [it] gross darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:17">13:17</a> And if ye will not hear it, my soul shall weep in secret  places for [your] pride; and mine eye shall weep sore, and run  down with tears, because Jehovah's flock is gone into  captivity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:18">13:18</a> Say unto the king and to the queen: Humble yourselves, sit  down low; for from your heads shall come down the crown of your  magnificence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:19">13:19</a> The cities of the south are shut up, and there is none to  open [them]; all Judah is carried away captive: it is wholly  carried away captive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:20">13:20</a> Lift up your eyes, and behold them that come from the  north. Where is the flock that was given thee, thy beautiful  flock?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:21">13:21</a> What wilt thou say when he shall visit thee, since thou  thyself hast trained them to be princes in chief over thee?  Shall not sorrows take thee, as a woman in travail?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:22">13:22</a> And if thou say in thy heart, Wherefore come these things  upon me? For the greatness of thine iniquity are thy skirts  uncovered, [and] thy heels have suffered violence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:23">13:23</a> Can an Ethiopian change his skin, or a leopard his spots?  [Then] may ye also do good, who are accustomed to do evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:24">13:24</a> And I will scatter them as stubble that passeth away by  the wind of the wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:25">13:25</a> This shall be thy lot, thy measured portion from me, saith  Jehovah; because thou hast forgotten me, and confided in  falsehood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:26">13:26</a> Therefore will I also turn thy skirts over thy face, and  thy shame shall be seen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:27">13:27</a> Thine adulteries, and thy neighings, the lewdness of thy  fornication, on the hills, in the fields, -- thine  abominations, have I seen. Woe unto thee, Jerusalem! Wilt thou  not be made clean? after how long a time yet?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah concerning the  drought.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> Judah mourneth, and the gates thereof languish, they are  black unto the ground; and the cry of Jerusalem goeth up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> And their nobles send their little ones for water: they  come to the pits, they find no water; they return with their  vessels empty; they are ashamed, they are confounded, and have  covered their heads.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> Because the ground is chapt, for there hath been no rain on  the earth, the ploughmen are ashamed, they cover their heads.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> For the hind also calveth in the field, and forsaketh [its  young], because there is no grass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And the wild asses stand on the heights, they snuff up the  wind like jackals; their eyes fail, because there is no  herbage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> Jehovah, though our iniquities testify against us, do thou  act for thy name's sake; for our backslidings are many -- we  have sinned against thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> Thou hope of Israel, its Saviour in the time of trouble,  why wilt thou be as a stranger in the land, and as a traveller  that turneth aside to stay a night?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> Why wilt thou be as a man astonished, as a mighty man that  cannot save? Yet thou, Jehovah, art in the midst of us, and we  are called by thy name: leave us not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> Thus saith Jehovah to this people: Even so have they loved  to wander, they have not refrained their feet; and Jehovah hath  no delight in them: now will he remember their iniquity, and  visit their sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Pray not for this people for  their good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> When they fast, I will not hear their cry; and when they  offer up burnt-offering and oblation, I will not accept them:  for I will consume them by sword, and by famine, and by  pestilence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And I said, Alas, Lord Jehovah! Behold, the prophets say  unto them, Ye shall not see the sword, neither shall ye have  famine; for I will give you assured peace in this place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And Jehovah said unto me, The prophets prophesy falsehood  in my name; I have not sent them, neither have I commanded  them, nor spoken unto them: they prophesy unto you a false  vision, and divination, and a thing of nought, and the deceit  of their heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the prophets that  prophesy in my name, and I sent them not, and who say, Sword  and famine shall not be in this land: By sword and by famine  shall those prophets be consumed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> and the people to whom they prophesy shall be cast out in  the streets of Jerusalem, because of the famine and the sword;  and there shall be none to bury them, them, their wives, and  their sons, and their daughters; and I will pour their  wickedness upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And thou shalt say this word unto them: Let mine eyes run  down with tears, night and day, and not cease; for the virgin  daughter of my people is broken with a great breach, with a  very grievous blow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> If I go forth into the field, behold the slain with the  sword! and if I enter into the city, behold them that pine away  with famine! For both prophet and priest shall go about into a  land that they know not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> -- Hast thou then utterly rejected Judah? Doth thy soul  loathe Zion? Why hast thou smitten us, and there is no healing  for us? Peace is looked for, and there is no good, -- and a  time of healing, and behold terror!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> Jehovah, we acknowledge our wickedness, the iniquity of  our fathers; for we have sinned against thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> For thy name's sake, do not spurn [us], do not disgrace  the throne of thy glory: remember, break not thy covenant with  us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:22">14:22</a> Are there any among the vanities of the nations that can  cause rain? or can the heavens give showers? Art not thou HE,  Jehovah, our God? And we wait upon thee; for thou hast made all  these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:1">15:1</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Though Moses and Samuel stood  before me, my soul [would] not [turn] toward this people. Send  [them] out of my sight, and let them go forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:2">15:2</a> And it shall come to pass, if they say unto thee, Whither  shall we go forth? then thou shalt tell them, Thus saith  Jehovah: Such as are for death, to death; and such as are for  the sword, to the sword; and such as are for the famine, to the  famine; and such as are for captivity, to captivity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:3">15:3</a> For I will visit them with four kinds [of punishments],  saith Jehovah: the sword to slay, and dogs to tear, and the  fowl of the heavens, and the beasts of the earth, to devour and  to destroy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:4">15:4</a> And I will give them over to be driven hither and thither  amongst all the kingdoms of the earth, because of Manasseh the  son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, for that which he did in  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:5">15:5</a> For who shall have pity upon thee, Jerusalem? and who shall  bemoan thee? and who shall turn aside to ask after thy welfare?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:6">15:6</a> Thou hast cast me off, saith Jehovah, thou art gone  backward; and I have stretched out my hand against thee, and  will destroy thee: I am become weary of repenting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:7">15:7</a> And I will fan them with a fan in the gates of the land; I  will bereave of children [and] destroy my people: they have not  returned from their ways.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_15:8">15:8</a> Their widows are increased to me more than the sand of the  seas; I have brought upon them, against the mother of the young  men, a spoiler at noonday; I have caused anguish and terror to  fall upon her suddenly.</p>

 <p><a name="an_15:20">15:20</a> And I will make thee unto this people a strong brazen  wall; and they shall fight against thee, but they shall not  prevail against thee: for I am with thee, to save thee and to  deliver thee, saith Jehovah;</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:3">16:3</a> For thus saith Jehovah concerning the sons and concerning  the daughters that are born in this place, and concerning their  mothers that bear them, and concerning their fathers that beget  them in this land:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:4">16:4</a> They shall die of painful deaths; they shall not be  lamented, neither shall they be buried; they shall be as dung  upon the face of the ground, and they shall be consumed by the  sword, and by famine, and their carcases shall be food for the  fowl of the heavens and for the beasts of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:5">16:5</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Enter not into the house of  wailing, neither go to lament or bemoan them; for I have taken  away my peace from this people, saith Jehovah, the  loving-kindness and the tender mercies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:6">16:6</a> Both great and small shall die in this land: they shall not  be buried; and none shall lament for them, or cut themselves,  nor make themselves bald for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:7">16:7</a> Nor shall they break [bread] for them in mourning, to  comfort them for the dead; neither shall they give them the cup  of consolations to drink for their father or for their mother.</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:10">16:10</a> And it shall come to pass, when thou shalt declare unto  this people all these words, and they shall say unto thee,  Wherefore hath Jehovah pronounced all this great evil against  us? and what is our iniquity? and what is our sin which we have  committed against Jehovah our God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:11">16:11</a> then shalt thou say unto them, Because your fathers have  forsaken me, saith Jehovah, and have walked after other gods,  and have served them, and have worshipped them, and have  forsaken me, and have not kept my law;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:12">16:12</a> and you, ye have done still worse than your fathers; and  there ye are walking every one after the stubbornness of his  evil heart, not to hearken unto me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:13">16:13</a> and I will cast you forth out of this land, into a land  that ye know not, ye nor your fathers; and there shall ye serve  other gods day and night: because I will shew you no favour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:14">16:14</a> Therefore, behold, days are coming, saith Jehovah, that it  shall no more be said, [As] Jehovah liveth, who brought up the  children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</p>

 <p><a name="an_16:16">16:16</a> Behold, I will send for many fishers, saith Jehovah, and  they shall fish them; and afterwards will I send for many  hunters, and they shall hunt them, from every mountain, and  from every hill, and out of the holes of the rocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:17">16:17</a> For mine eyes are upon all their ways; they are not  concealed from my face, neither is their iniquity hidden from  before mine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:18">16:18</a> But first I will recompense their iniquity and their sin  double, because they have profaned my land with the carcases of  their detestable things, and with their abominations have they  filled mine inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_16:19">16:19</a> Jehovah, my strength and my fortress, and my refuge in the  day of distress, unto thee shall the nations come from the ends  of the earth, and they shall say, Surely our fathers have  inherited falsehood [and] vanity; and in these things there is  no profit.</p>

 <p><a name="an_17:21">17:21</a> thus saith Jehovah: Take heed to your souls, and bear no  burden on the sabbath day, and bring nothing in through the  gates of Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:22">17:22</a> and carry forth no burden out of your houses on the  sabbath day, neither do any work; but hallow ye the sabbath  day, as I commanded your fathers,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:23">17:23</a> but they hearkened not, neither inclined their ear, but  hardened their neck, that they might not hear nor receive  instruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:24">17:24</a> And it shall come to pass, if ye diligently hearken unto  me, saith Jehovah, to bring in no burden through the gates of  this city on the sabbath day, and to hallow the sabbath day, to  do no work therein;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:25">17:25</a> then shall there enter in, through the gates of this city,  kings and princes sitting upon the throne of David, riding in  chariots and on horses, they and their princes, the men of  Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem: and this city shall be  inhabited for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:26">17:26</a> And they shall come from the cities of Judah, and from the  places around Jerusalem, and from the land of Benjamin, and  from the lowland, and from the hill-country, and from the  south, bringing burnt-offerings, and sacrifices, and oblations,  and incense, and bringing thanksgiving unto the house of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_17:27">17:27</a> But if ye will not hearken unto me, to hallow the sabbath  day and not to bear a burden and enter in through the gates of  Jerusalem on the sabbath day, then will I kindle a fire in the  gates thereof, and it shall devour the palaces of Jerusalem,  and it shall not be quenched.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:1">18:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:3">18:3</a> And I went down to the potter's house; and behold, he  wrought a work on the wheels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:4">18:4</a> And the vessel that he made was marred, as clay, in the  hand of the potter; and he made it again another vessel, as  seemed good to the potter to make.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:5">18:5</a> And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:9">18:9</a> And at the moment that I speak concerning a nation and  concerning a kingdom, to build and to plant,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:10">18:10</a> if it do evil in my sight, that it hearken not unto my  voice, then I will repent of the good wherewith I said I would  benefit them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:11">18:11</a> And now, speak to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants  of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I prepare  evil against you, and devise a device against you: turn ye then  every one from his evil way, and amend your ways and your  doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:12">18:12</a> But they say, There is no hope; for we will walk after our  own devices, and we will each one do [according to] the  stubbornness of his evil heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:13">18:13</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ask ye now among the  nations, Who hath heard such things? The virgin of Israel hath  done a very horrible thing.</p>

 <p><a name="an_18:17">18:17</a> As with an east wind will I scatter them before the enemy;  I will shew them the back, and not the face, in the day of  their calamity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:18">18:18</a> And they said, Come, and let us devise devices against  Jeremiah; for law shall not perish from the priest, nor counsel  from the wise, nor word from the prophet. Come and let us smite  him with the tongue, and let us not give heed to any of his  words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:19">18:19</a> Jehovah, give heed to me, and listen to the voice of those  that contend with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:20">18:20</a> Shall evil be recompensed for good? For they have digged a  pit for my soul. Remember how I stood before thee to speak good  for them, to turn away thy wrath from them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:21">18:21</a> Therefore give up their children to the famine, and  deliver them over to the power of the sword; and let their  wives be bereaved of children and be widows; and let their men  be swept off by death, their young men be smitten by the sword  in battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:22">18:22</a> Let a cry be heard from their houses, when thou shalt  bring a troop suddenly upon them; for they have digged a pit to  take me, and have hidden snares for my feet.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_18:23">18:23</a> And thou, Jehovah, knowest all their counsel against me to  slay me. Forgive not their iniquity, neither blot out their sin  from thy sight, but let them be overthrown before thee: deal  with them in the time of thine anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:1">19:1</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Go and buy a potter's earthen flagon,  and [take] of the elders of the people, and of the elders of  the priests;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:2">19:2</a> and go forth unto the valley of the son of Hinnom, which is  by the entry of the pottery-gate, and proclaim there the words  that I shall tell thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:3">19:3</a> and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O kings of Judah, and  inhabitants of Jerusalem. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God  of Israel: Behold, I will bring evil upon this place, the which  whosoever heareth, his ears shall tingle;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:4">19:4</a> because they have forsaken me, and have estranged this  place [from me], and have burned incense in it unto other gods,  whom neither they nor their fathers have known, nor the kings  of Judah; and have filled this place with the blood of  innocents;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:5">19:5</a> and they have built the high places of Baal, to burn their  sons in the fire as burnt-offerings unto Baal, which I  commanded not, nor spake it, neither came it up into my mind:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:6">19:6</a> therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that this place  shall no more be called Topheth, nor Valley of the son of  Hinnom, but the valley of slaughter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:7">19:7</a> And I will make void the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in  this place; and I will cause them to fall by the sword before  their enemies, and by the hand of them that seek their life,  and their carcases will I give as food to the fowl of the  heavens and to the beasts of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:8">19:8</a> And I will make this city an astonishment and a hissing;  every one that passeth by shall be astonished and hiss because  of all the plagues thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:9">19:9</a> And I will cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and  the flesh of their daughters, and they shall eat everyone the  flesh of his friend, in the siege and in the straitness  wherewith their enemies, and they that seek their lives, shall  straiten them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:10">19:10</a> And thou shalt break the flagon in the sight of the men  that go with thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:11">19:11</a> and shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Even  so will I break this people and this city, as one breaketh a  potter's vessel, that cannot be made whole again. And they  shall bury in Topheth, till there be no place to bury.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:12">19:12</a> Thus will I do unto this place, saith Jehovah, and to the  inhabitants thereof, and make this city as Topheth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:13">19:13</a> And the houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of  Judah shall be as the place of Topheth, defiled, all the houses  upon whose roofs they have burned incense unto all the host of  the heavens, and have poured out drink-offerings unto other  gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:14">19:14</a> And Jeremiah came from Topheth, whither Jehovah had sent  him to prophesy; and he stood in the court of Jehovah's house,  and said to all the people,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_19:15">19:15</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I  will bring upon this city and upon all her cities all the evil  that I have spoken against it; for they have hardened their  necks, not to hear my words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:1">20:1</a> And Pashur the son of Immer, the priest -- and he was chief  officer in the house of Jehovah -- heard Jeremiah prophesy  these things.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:2">20:2</a> And Pashur smote Jeremiah the prophet, and put him in the  stocks that were in the upper gate of Benjamin, which was in  the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:3">20:3</a> And it came to pass the next day, that Pashur brought forth  Jeremiah out of the stocks; and Jeremiah said unto him, Jehovah  hath not called thy name Pashur, but Magor-missabib.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:4">20:4</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I make thee a terror to  thyself, and to all thy friends; and they shall fall by the  sword of their enemies, and thine eyes shall see [it]; and I  will give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon, and  he shall carry them captive into Babylon, and shall smite them  with the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:5">20:5</a> And, I will give all the wealth of this city, and all its  gains, and all its precious things, and all the treasures of  the kings of Judah, will I give into the hand of their enemies;  and they shall make them a prey, and take them, and carry them  to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:6">20:6</a> And thou, Pashur, and all that dwell in thy house shall go  into captivity; and thou shalt come to Babylon, and there thou  shalt die, and there thou shalt be buried, thou and all thy  friends to whom thou hast prophesied falsehood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:7">20:7</a> Jehovah, thou hast enticed me, and I was enticed; thou hast  laid hold of me, and hast prevailed; I am become a derision the  whole day: every one mocketh me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:8">20:8</a> For as oft as I speak, I cry out; I proclaim violence and  spoil; for the word of Jehovah is become unto me a reproach and  a derision all the day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:9">20:9</a> And I said, I will not make mention of him, nor speak any  more in his name: but it was in my heart as a burning fire shut  up in my bones; and I became wearied with holding in, and I  could not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:10">20:10</a> For I have heard the defaming of many, terror on every  side: Report, and we will report it. All my familiars are  watching for my stumbling: Peradventure he will be enticed, and  we shall prevail against him; and we shall take our revenge on  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:11">20:11</a> But Jehovah is with me as a mighty terrible one; therefore  my persecutors shall stumble and shall not prevail; they shall  be greatly ashamed, for they have not prospered: it shall be an  everlasting confusion that shall not be forgotten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:12">20:12</a> And thou, Jehovah of hosts, who triest the righteous, who  seest the reins and the heart, let me see thy vengeance on  them; for unto thee have I revealed my cause.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:13">20:13</a> Sing ye unto Jehovah, praise Jehovah, for he hath  delivered the soul of the needy from the hand of evildoers.</p>

 <p><a name="an_20:16">20:16</a> And let that man be as the cities which Jehovah overthrew,  and repented not; and let him hear a cry in the morning, and a  shouting at noonday,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:17">20:17</a> because he slew me not from the womb. Or would that my  mother had been my grave, and her womb always great [with me]!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_20:18">20:18</a> Wherefore came I forth from the womb to see labour and  sorrow, that my days should be consumed in shame?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:1">21:1</a> The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, when king  Zedekiah sent unto him Pashur the son of Malchijah, and  Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah, the priest, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_21:3">21:3</a> And Jeremiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say to Zedekiah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:4">21:4</a> Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Behold, I will turn  back the weapons of war that are in your hands, with which ye  fight against the king of Babylon, and against the Chaldeans  who besiege you, outside the walls, and I will assemble them  into the midst of this city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:5">21:5</a> And I myself will fight against you with a stretched-out  hand, and with a strong arm, and in anger, and in fury, and in  great wrath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:6">21:6</a> And I will smite the inhabitants of this city, both man and  beast: they shall die of a great pestilence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:7">21:7</a> And afterwards, saith Jehovah, I will give Zedekiah king of  Judah, and his servants, and the people, and such as are left  in this city from the pestilence, from the sword, and from the  famine, into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon,  and into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of those  that seek their life, and he shall smite them with the edge of  the sword: he shall not spare them, neither have pity, nor have  mercy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:8">21:8</a> And unto this people thou shalt say, Thus saith Jehovah:  Behold, I set before you the way of life, and the way of death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:9">21:9</a> He that abideth in this city shall die by the sword, and by  the famine, and by the pestilence; but he that goeth out, and  deserteth to the Chaldeans that besiege you, he shall live, and  his life shall be unto him for a prey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:10">21:10</a> For I have set my face against this city for evil, and not  for good, saith Jehovah: it shall be given into the hand of the  king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:11">21:11</a> And touching the house of the king of Judah, hear ye the  word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:12">21:12</a> House of David, thus saith Jehovah: Judge with justice in  the morning, and deliver him that is spoiled out of the hand of  the oppressor, lest my fury go forth like fire and burn, and  there be none to quench it, because of the evil of your doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:13">21:13</a> Behold, I am against thee, inhabitress of the valley, the  rock of the plain, saith Jehovah; ye that say, Who shall come  down against us, or who shall enter into our dwellings?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:14">21:14</a> And I will visit you according to the fruit of your  doings, saith Jehovah; and I will kindle a fire in her forest,  and it shall devour all that is round about her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Go down to the house of the king of  Judah, and speak there this word,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> and say, Hear the word of Jehovah, O king of Judah, that  sittest upon the throne of David, thou, and thy servants, and  thy people who enter in through these gates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Execute judgment and righteousness, and  deliver the spoiled out of the hand of the oppressor; and do no  wrong, do no violence to the stranger, the fatherless, or the  widow, and shed not innocent blood in this place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> For if ye do this thing indeed, then shall there enter in  through the gates of this house kings sitting in the place of  David upon his throne, riding in chariots and on horses, -- he,  and his servants, and his people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> But if ye will not hear these words, I have sworn by  myself, saith Jehovah, that this house shall become a waste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> For thus saith Jehovah concerning the house of the king of  Judah: Thou art a Gilead unto me, the summit of Lebanon: verily  I will make thee a wilderness, cities not inhabited.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And I will prepare destroyers against thee, every one with  his weapons; and they shall cut down the choice of thy cedars,  and cast [them] into the fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And many nations shall pass by this city, and they shall  say every man to his neighbour, Wherefore hath Jehovah done  thus unto this great city?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> And they shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant  of Jehovah their God, and worshipped other gods, and served  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> Weep not for the dead, neither bemoan him; [but] weep sore  for him that goeth away, for he shall return no more, nor see  his native country.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> For thus saith Jehovah concerning Shallum the son of  Josiah, the king of Judah, who reigned instead of Josiah his  father, who went forth out of this place: He shall not return  thither any more;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> for he shall die in the place whither they have led him  captive, and shall see this land no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> Woe unto him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness,  and his upper chambers by injustice; that taketh his  neighbour's service without wages, and giveth him not his  earning;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> that saith, I will build me a wide house, and spacious  upper chambers; and he cutteth out for himself windows; and it  is wainscoted with cedar, and painted with vermilion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> Shalt thou reign, because thou viest with the cedar? Did  not thy father eat and drink, and do judgment and justice? Then  it was well with him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> He judged the cause of the poor and needy; then it was  well. Was not this to know me? saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> But thine eyes and thy heart are only on thine extortion,  and on the blood of the innocent, to shed it, and on oppression  and on violence, to do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim the son  of Josiah, the king of Judah: They shall not lament for him,  Ah, my brother! or, Ah, sister! They shall not lament for him,  Ah, lord! or Ah, his glory!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> He shall be buried with the burial of an ass, dragged  along and cast forth beyond the gates of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> Go up to Lebanon, and cry; and give forth thy voice in  Bashan, and cry from [the heights of] Abarim: for all thy  lovers are destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> I spoke unto thee in thy prosperity; [but] thou saidst, I  will not hear. This hath been thy way from thy youth, that thou  hearkenedst not unto my voice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> The wind shall feed on all thy shepherds, and thy lovers  shall go into captivity; surely, then shalt thou be ashamed and  confounded for all thy wickedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> Thou inhabitress of Lebanon, that makest thy nest in the  cedars, how pitiful shalt thou be when pangs come upon thee,  pain as of a woman in travail!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> [As] I live, saith Jehovah, though Coniah the son of  Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, were a signet upon my right hand,  yet will I pluck thee thence;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> and I will give thee into the hand of them that seek thy  life, and into the hand of them before whom thou art afraid,  even into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, and into  the hand of the Chaldeans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:26">22:26</a> And I will cast thee out, and thy mother that bare thee,  into another country, where ye were not born; and there shall  ye die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:27">22:27</a> And into the land whereunto they lift up their souls to  return, thither shall they not return.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:28">22:28</a> Is this man Coniah a despised broken vase? a vessel  wherein is no delight? Wherefore are they thrown out, he and  his seed, and are cast into a land which they know not?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:29">22:29</a> O earth, earth, earth, hear the word of Jehovah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:30">22:30</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Write this man childless, a man that  shall not prosper in his days; for no man of his seed shall  prosper, sitting upon the throne of David, and ruling any more  in Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> Woe unto the shepherds that destroy and scatter the sheep  of my pasture! saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel concerning  the shepherds that feed my people: Ye have scattered my flock,  and driven them away, and have not visited them: behold, I will  visit upon you the evil of your doings, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all  countries whither I have driven them, and will bring them again  to their pastures; and they shall be fruitful and shall  multiply.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> And I will raise up shepherds over them, who shall feed  them; and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither  shall any be missing, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, when I will raise  unto David a righteous Branch, who shall reign as king, and act  wisely, and shall execute judgment and righteousness in the  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell in  safety; and this is his name whereby he shall be called,  Jehovah our Righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> Therefore behold, days are coming, saith Jehovah, that they  shall no more say, [As] Jehovah liveth, who brought up the  children of Israel out of the land of Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> but, [As] Jehovah liveth, who brought up and who led back  the seed of the house of Israel out of the north country, and  from all countries whither I had driven them. And they shall  dwell in their own land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> Concerning the prophets: My heart within me is broken; all  my bones shake; I am like a drunken man, and like a man whom  wine hath overcome; because of Jehovah, and because of the  words of his holiness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> For the land is full of adulterers; for because of  execration the land mourneth. The pastures of the wilderness  are dried up; for their course is evil, and their force is not  right.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> For both prophet and priest are profane: even in my house  have I found their wickedness, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> Therefore their way shall be unto them as slippery places  in the darkness; they shall be driven on, and fall therein: for  I will bring evil upon them in the year of their visitation,  saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> And I have seen folly in the prophets of Samaria: they  prophesied by Baal, and caused my people Israel to err.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> And in the prophets of Jerusalem have I seen a horrible  thing: they commit adultery, and walk in falsehood, and  strengthen the hands of evildoers, so that none doth return  from his wickedness. They are all become unto me as Sodom, and  the inhabitants thereof as Gomorrah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the  prophets: Behold, I will feed them with wormwood, and make them  drink water of gall; for from the prophets of Jerusalem is  profaneness gone forth into all the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Hearken not unto the words of  the prophets that prophesy unto you: they lead you to vanity;  they speak a vision of their own heart, not out of the mouth of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> They say constantly unto them that despise me, Jehovah  hath said, Ye shall have peace. And they say unto every one  that walketh in the stubbornness of his heart, No evil shall  come upon you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> For who hath stood in the council of Jehovah, so that he  hath perceived and heard his word? who hath hearkened to his  word and listened?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:19">23:19</a> Behold, a tempest of Jehovah, fury is gone forth, yea, a  whirling storm: it shall whirl down upon the head of the  wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:20">23:20</a> The anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he have  executed, and until he have performed the purposes of his  heart: at the end of the days ye shall understand it clearly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:21">23:21</a> I did not send the prophets, yet they ran; I have not  spoken to them, yet they prophesied.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:22">23:22</a> But if they had stood in my council, and had caused my  people to hear my words, then would they have turned them from  their evil way and from the wickedness of their doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:23">23:23</a> Am I a God at hand, saith Jehovah, and not a God afar off?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:24">23:24</a> Can any hide himself in secret places, that I shall not  see him? saith Jehovah. Do not I fill the heavens and the  earth? saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:25">23:25</a> I have heard what the prophets say, who prophesy falsehood  in my name, saying, I have dreamed, I have dreamed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:26">23:26</a> How long shall [this] be in the heart of the prophets who  prophesy falsehood, and who are prophets of the deceit of their  own heart?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:27">23:27</a> who think to cause my people to forget my name by their  dreams which they tell every man to his neighbour: as their  fathers have forgotten my name for Baal.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:28">23:28</a> The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell the dream; and  he that hath my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is  the chaff to the wheat? saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:29">23:29</a> Is not my word like a fire, saith Jehovah; and like a  hammer [that] breaketh the rock in pieces?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:30">23:30</a> Therefore, behold, I am against the prophets, saith  Jehovah, that steal my words every one from his neighbour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:31">23:31</a> Behold, I am against the prophets, saith Jehovah, that use  their tongues, and say, He hath said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:32">23:32</a> Behold, I am against them that prophesy false dreams,  saith Jehovah, and that tell them, and cause my people to err  by their lies and by their boasting; and I have not sent them,  nor commanded them; and they profit not this people at all,  saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:33">23:33</a> And when this people, or a prophet, or a priest, ask thee,  saying, What is the burden of Jehovah? thou shalt then say unto  them, What burden? I will even cast you off, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:34">23:34</a> And as for the prophet, and the priest, and the people,  that shall say, The burden of Jehovah, I will even punish that  man and his house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:35">23:35</a> Thus shall ye say every one to his neighbour, and every  one to his brother: What hath Jehovah answered? and, What hath  Jehovah spoken?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:36">23:36</a> And the burden of Jehovah shall ye mention no more; for  every man's own word shall be his burden: for ye have perverted  the words of the living God, of Jehovah of hosts, our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:37">23:37</a> Thus shalt thou say to the prophet: What hath Jehovah  answered thee? and, What hath Jehovah spoken?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:38">23:38</a> But since ye say, The burden of Jehovah, therefore thus  saith Jehovah: Because ye say this word, The burden of Jehovah,  and I have sent unto you, saying, Ye shall not say, The burden  of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:39">23:39</a> therefore behold, I will utterly forget you, and I will  cast you off, far from my face, and the city that I gave to you  and to your fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:40">23:40</a> And I will bring everlasting reproach upon you, and  everlasting shame, that shall not be forgotten.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> Jehovah shewed me, and behold, two baskets of figs, set  before the temple of Jehovah, after that Nebuchadrezzar king of  Babylon had carried away captive from Jerusalem, Jeconiah the  son of Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and the princes of Judah,  and the craftsmen and smiths, and had brought them to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> One basket had very good figs, like the figs first ripe;  and the other basket had very bad figs, which could not be  eaten for badness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> And Jehovah said unto me, What seest thou, Jeremiah? And I  said, Figs: the good figs very good; and the bad very bad,  which cannot be eaten for badness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Like these good  figs, so will I regard for good them that are carried away  captive of Judah, whom I have sent out of this place into the  land of the Chaldeans;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> and I will set mine eyes upon them for good, and I will  bring them again to this land; and I will build them and not  pull them down, and I will plant them and not pluck them up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> And I will give them a heart to know me, that I am Jehovah;  and they shall be my people, and I will be their God: for they  shall return unto me with their whole heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> And as the bad figs, which cannot be eaten for badness,  surely, thus saith Jehovah: So will I make Zedekiah the king of  Judah, and his princes, and the remnant of Jerusalem, that  remain in this land, and them that dwell in the land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> And I will give them over to be driven hither and thither  unto all the kingdoms of the earth for evil, to be a reproach  and a proverb, a taunt and a curse, in all places whither I  shall drive them;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> and I will send among them the sword, the famine, and the  pestilence, until they be consumed from off the land that I  gave unto them and to their fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of  Judah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the  king of Judah (that is, the first year of Nebuchadrezzar king  of Babylon),</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> which Jeremiah the prophet spoke unto all the people of  Judah and to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, saying:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> From the thirteenth year of Josiah the son of Amon, the  king of Judah, even unto this day, these three and twenty  years, the word of Jehovah hath come unto me, and I have spoken  unto you, rising early and speaking; but ye have not hearkened.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> And Jehovah hath sent unto you all his servants the  prophets, rising early and sending; but ye have not hearkened,  nor inclined your ear to hear,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> when they said, Turn again now every one from his evil way,  and from the wickedness of your doings, and dwell in the land  that Jehovah hath given unto you and to your fathers from of  old even for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> And go not after other gods, to serve them and to worship  them; and provoke me not to anger with the work of your hands;  and I will do you no hurt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> But ye have not hearkened unto me, saith Jehovah; that ye  might provoke me to anger with the work of your hands, to your  own hurt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Because ye have not  listened to my words,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> behold, I will send and take all the families of the north,  saith Jehovah, and [I will send] to Nebuchadrezzar the king of  Babylon, my servant, and will bring them against this land, and  against the inhabitants thereof, and against all these nations  round about; and I will utterly destroy them, and make them an  astonishment, and a hissing, and perpetual wastes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> And I will cause to perish from them the voice of mirth  and the voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice  of the bride, the sound of the millstones and the light of the  lamp.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> And this whole land shall become a waste, an astonishment;  and these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy  years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> And it shall come to pass, when seventy years are  accomplished, [that] I will visit on the king of Babylon and on  that nation, saith Jehovah, their iniquity, and on the land of  the Chaldeans, and I will make it perpetual desolations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:13">25:13</a> And I will bring upon that land all my words which I have  pronounced against it, all that is written in this book, which  Jeremiah hath prophesied against all the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:14">25:14</a> For many nations and great kings shall serve themselves of  them also; and I will recompense them according to their deeds,  and according to the work of their hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:15">25:15</a> For thus hath Jehovah the God of Israel said unto me: Take  the cup of the wine of this fury at my hand, and cause all the  nations to whom I send thee to drink it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:16">25:16</a> And they shall drink, and reel to and fro, and be mad,  because of the sword that I will send among them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:17">25:17</a> And I took the cup at Jehovah's hand, and made all the  nations to drink, to whom Jehovah had sent me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:18">25:18</a> Jerusalem, and the cities of Judah, and the kings thereof,  and the princes thereof, to make them a waste, an astonishment,  a hissing, and a curse, as it is this day;</p>

 <p><a name="an_25:26">25:26</a> and all the kings of the north, far and near, one with  another; and all the kingdoms of the world, which are upon the  face of the earth; and the king of Sheshach shall drink after  them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:27">25:27</a> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts,  the God of Israel: Drink, and be drunken, and vomit, and fall,  and rise no more, because of the sword that I will send among  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:28">25:28</a> And it shall be, if they refuse to take the cup from thy  hand to drink, then shalt thou say unto them, Thus saith  Jehovah of hosts: Ye shall certainly drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:29">25:29</a> For behold, I begin to bring evil on the city that is  called by my name, and should ye be altogether unpunished? Ye  shall not be unpunished; for I call for a sword upon all the  inhabitants of the earth, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:30">25:30</a> And thou, prophesy unto them all these words, and say unto  them, Jehovah will roar from on high, and utter his voice from  his holy habitation; he will mightily roar upon his  dwelling-place, he will give a shout, as they that tread [the  vintage], against all the inhabitants of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:31">25:31</a> The noise shall come to the end of the earth: for Jehovah  hath a controversy with the nations, he entereth into judgment  with all flesh; as for the wicked, he will give them up to the  sword, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:32">25:32</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, evil shall go forth  from nation to nation, and a great storm shall be raised up  from the uttermost parts of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:33">25:33</a> And the slain of Jehovah shall [be] at that day from [one]  end of the earth even unto the [other] end of the earth: they  shall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they shall  be dung upon the face of the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:34">25:34</a> Howl, ye shepherds, and cry; and wallow yourselves [in the  dust], noble ones of the flock: for the days of your slaughter  are accomplished, and I will disperse you; and ye shall fall  like a precious vessel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:35">25:35</a> And refuge shall perish from the shepherds, and escape  from the noble ones of the flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:36">25:36</a> There shall be a voice of the cry of the shepherds, and a  howling of the noble ones of the flock: for Jehovah layeth  waste their pasture;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:37">25:37</a> and the peaceable enclosures shall be desolated, because  of the fierce anger of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:38">25:38</a> He hath forsaken his covert as a young lion; for their  land is a desolation because of the fierceness of the  oppressor, and because of his fierce anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of  Josiah, the king of Judah, came this word from Jehovah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:2">26:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Stand in the court of Jehovah's house,  and speak unto all the cities of Judah, which come to worship  in Jehovah's house, all the words that I command thee to speak  unto them: diminish not a word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:3">26:3</a> Peradventure they will hearken, and turn every man from his  evil way, that I may repent me of the evil which I purpose to  do unto them because of the wickedness of their doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:4">26:4</a> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah: If ye  will not hearken unto me, to walk in my law, which I have set  before you,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:5">26:5</a> to hearken unto the words of my servants the prophets, whom  I have sent unto you, even rising early and sending [them], but  ye have not hearkened,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:6">26:6</a> -- then will I make this house like Shiloh, and will make  this city a curse to all the nations of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:7">26:7</a> And the priests and the prophets and all the people heard  Jeremiah speaking these words in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:8">26:8</a> And it came to pass when Jeremiah had ended speaking all  that Jehovah had commanded [him] to speak unto all the people,  that the priests and the prophets and all the people seized  him, saying, Thou shalt certainly die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:9">26:9</a> Why hast thou prophesied in the name of Jehovah, saying,  This house shall be like Shiloh, and this city shall be  desolate, without inhabitant? And all the people were gathered  against Jeremiah in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:10">26:10</a> And the princes of Judah heard these things; and they went  up from the king's house unto the house of Jehovah, and sat in  the entry of the new gate of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:11">26:11</a> And the priests and the prophets spoke unto the princes  and to all the people, saying, This man is worthy to die, for  he hath prophesied against this city, as ye have heard with  your ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:12">26:12</a> And Jeremiah spoke to all the princes and to all the  people, saying, Jehovah sent me to prophesy against this house  and against this city all the words that ye have heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:13">26:13</a> And now, amend your ways and your doings, and hearken to  the voice of Jehovah your God; and Jehovah will repent him of  the evil that he hath pronounced against you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:14">26:14</a> But as for me, behold, I am in your hand; do unto me as  seemeth good and right in your eyes:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:15">26:15</a> only know for certain that if ye put me to death, ye shall  surely bring innocent blood upon yourselves, and upon this  city, and upon the inhabitants thereof; for of a truth Jehovah  hath sent me unto you to speak all these words in your ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:16">26:16</a> And the princes and all the people said unto the priests  and to the prophets, This man is not worthy to die; for he hath  spoken to us in the name of Jehovah our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:17">26:17</a> And there rose up certain of the elders of the land and  spoke to all the congregation of the people, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:18">26:18</a> Micah the Morasthite prophesied in the days of Hezekiah  king of Judah, and spoke to all the people of Judah, saying,  Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Zion shall be ploughed [as] a  field, and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of  the house as the high places of a forest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:19">26:19</a> Did Hezekiah king of Judah and all Judah put him at all to  death? Did he not fear Jehovah, and supplicate Jehovah, and  Jehovah repented him of the evil that he had pronounced against  them? And we should be doing a great evil against our souls.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:20">26:20</a> And there was also a man that prophesied in the name of  Jehovah, Urijah the son of Shemaiah of Kirjath-jearim: and he  prophesied against this city and against this land according to  all the words of Jeremiah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:21">26:21</a> and Jehoiakim the king, and all his mighty men, and all  the princes, heard his words, and the king sought to put him to  death; but Urijah heard it, and he was afraid, and fled, and  went into Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:22">26:22</a> And Jehoiakim the king sent men into Egypt, Elnathan the  son of Achbor, and men with him, into Egypt;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:23">26:23</a> and they fetched forth Urijah out of Egypt, and brought  him to Jehoiakim the king; and he slew him with the sword, and  cast his dead body into the graves of the children of the  people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:24">26:24</a> -- Nevertheless the hand of Ahikam the son of Shaphan was  with Jeremiah, that they should not give him into the hand of  the people to put him to death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:1">27:1</a> In the beginning of the reign of Jehoiakim the son of  Josiah, the king of Judah, came this word to Jeremiah from  Jehovah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:2">27:2</a> Thus hath Jehovah said unto me: Make thee bonds and yokes,  and put them upon thy neck;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:3">27:3</a> and send them to the king of Edom, and to the king of Moab,  and to the king of the children of Ammon, and to the king of  Tyre, and to the king of Zidon, by the hand of the messengers  that come to Jerusalem unto Zedekiah king of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:4">27:4</a> And give them a charge unto their masters, saying, Thus  saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say  unto your masters:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> I have made the earth, man and beast that are upon the face  of the earth, by my great power and by my outstretched arm; and  I give them unto whom it seemeth right in mine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> And now have I given all these lands into the hand of  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, my servant; and the beasts of  the field also have I given him to serve him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> And all the nations shall serve him, and his son, and his  son's son, until the time of his land also come, when many  nations and great kings shall reduce him to servitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> And it shall come to pass, that the nation and kingdom  which will not serve the same Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,  and that will not put their neck under the yoke of the king of  Babylon, that nation will I visit, saith Jehovah, with the  sword, and with the famine, and with the pestilence, until I  have consumed them by his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> And ye, hearken not to your prophets, nor to your diviners,  nor to your dreamers, nor to your soothsayers, nor to your  sorcerers, who speak unto you saying: Ye shall not serve the  king of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:10">27:10</a> For they prophesy falsehood unto you, to remove you far  from your land, and that I should drive you out, and ye should  perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:11">27:11</a> But the nation that bringeth its neck under the yoke of  the king of Babylon and serveth him, will I let remain still in  its own land, saith Jehovah; and they shall till it, and dwell  therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:12">27:12</a> And I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah according to all  these words, saying, bring your necks under the yoke of the  king of Babylon, and serve him and his people, and live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:13">27:13</a> Why will ye die, thou and thy people, by the sword, by the  famine, and by the pestilence, as Jehovah hath spoken  concerning the nation that will not serve the king of Babylon?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:14">27:14</a> And hearken not unto the words of the prophets that speak  unto you, saying, Ye shall not serve the king of Babylon; for  they prophesy falsehood unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:15">27:15</a> For I have not sent them, saith Jehovah, yet they prophesy  falsely in my name; in order that I should drive you out, and  that ye should perish, ye, and the prophets who prophesy unto  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:16">27:16</a> And I spoke to the priests and to all this people, saying,  Thus saith Jehovah: Hearken not to the words of your prophets  that prophesy unto you, saying, Behold, the vessels of  Jehovah's house shall now shortly be brought again from  Babylon; for they prophesy falsehood unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:17">27:17</a> Hearken not unto them; serve the king of Babylon, and  live: wherefore should this city become a waste?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:18">27:18</a> But if they be prophets, and if the word of Jehovah be  with them, let them now make intercession to Jehovah of hosts,  that the vessels which are left in the house of Jehovah, and in  the house of the king of Judah, and at Jerusalem, go not to  Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:19">27:19</a> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts concerning the pillars,  and concerning the sea, and concerning the bases, and  concerning the rest of the vessels that are left in this city,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:20">27:20</a> which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took not, when he  carried away captive Jeconiah the son of Jehoiakim, the king of  Judah, from Jerusalem to Babylon, along with all the nobles of  Judah and Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:21">27:21</a> yea, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel,  concerning the vessels that are left in the house of Jehovah,  and in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:22">27:22</a> They shall be carried to Babylon, and there shall they be  until the day of my visiting them, saith Jehovah; then I will  bring them up, and restore them to this place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> And it came to pass the same year, in the beginning of the  reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year, in the  fifth month, [that] Hananiah the son of Azzur, the prophet, who  was of Gibeon, spoke to me in the house of Jehovah, in the  presence of the priests and of all the people, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a> Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,  I have broken the yoke of the king of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:3">28:3</a> Within two full years will I bring again into this place  all the vessels of Jehovah's house, that Nebuchadnezzar king of  Babylon took away from this place, and carried to Babylon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a> and I will bring again to this place Jeconiah the son of  Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, with all the captives of Judah  that went to Babylon, saith Jehovah: for I will break the yoke  of the king of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a> And the prophet Jeremiah spoke unto the prophet Hananiah in  the presence of the priests, and in the presence of all the  people that stood in the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a> And the prophet Jeremiah said, Amen, may Jehovah do so! may  Jehovah perform thy words which thou hast prophesied, to bring  again from Babylon, into this place, the vessels of Jehovah's  house, and all them of the captivity!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a> Nevertheless, hear, I pray thee, this word which I speak in  thine ears, and in the ears of all the people:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a> The prophets that have been before me and before thee of  old, prophesied also concerning many countries and concerning  great kingdoms, of war, and of evil, and of pestilence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> The prophet that prophesieth of peace, when the word of the  prophet shall come to pass, shall be known as the prophet whom  Jehovah hath really sent.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> And the prophet Hananiah took the yoke from off the  prophet Jeremiah's neck, and broke it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a> And Hananiah spoke in the presence of all the people,  saying, Thus saith Jehovah: So will I break the yoke of  Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon within two full years from  off the neck of all the nations. And the prophet Jeremiah went  his way.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:12">28:12</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, after that the  prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke from off the neck of the  prophet Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> Go and tell Hananiah, saying, Thus saith Jehovah: Thou  hast broken the yokes of wood, and thou hast made in their  place yokes of iron.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: I have  put a yoke of iron upon the neck of all these nations, that  they may serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon; and they shall  serve him: and I have given him the beasts of the field also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> And the prophet Jeremiah said unto the prophet Hananiah,  Hear now, Hananiah: Jehovah hath not sent thee; and thou makest  this people to trust in falsehood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will cast thee  from off the face of the earth: this year thou shalt die, for  thou hast spoken revolt against Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:17">28:17</a> And the prophet Hananiah died in the same year in the  seventh month.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:1">29:1</a> And these are the words of the letter that the prophet  Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to the residue of the elders of  the captivity, and to the priests, and to the prophets, and to  all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive  from Jerusalem to Babylon</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:2">29:2</a> (after that Jeconiah the king, and the queen, and the  eunuchs, the princes of Judah and Jerusalem, and the craftsmen,  and the smiths, had departed from Jerusalem);</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:3">29:3</a> by the hand of Elasah the son of Shaphan, and Gemariah the  son of Hilkijah (whom Zedekiah king of Judah sent to Babylon,  unto Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon), saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, unto all  the captivity, whom I have caused to be carried away from  Jerusalem unto Babylon:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> Build houses, and dwell in them, and plant gardens, and eat  the fruit of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> Take wives, and beget sons and daughters; and take wives  for your sons, and give your daughters to husbands, that they  may bear sons and daughters; and multiply there, and be not  diminished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> And seek the peace of the city whither I have caused you to  be carried away captive, and pray unto Jehovah for it: for in  the peace thereof shall ye have peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Let not  your prophets that are in your midst, nor your diviners deceive  you, neither hearken to your dreams, which ye like to dream.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> For they prophesy falsely unto you in my name: I have not  sent them, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> For thus saith Jehovah: When seventy years shall be  accomplished for Babylon I will visit you, and perform my good  word toward you, in bringing you back to this place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:11">29:11</a> For I know the thoughts that I think toward you, saith  Jehovah, thoughts of peace, and not of evil, to give you in  your latter end a hope.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> And ye shall call upon me, and ye shall go and pray unto  me, and I will hearken unto you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> and ye shall seek me and find me, for ye shall search for  me with all your heart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> and I will be found of you, saith Jehovah. And I will turn  your captivity, and I will gather you from all the nations, and  from all the places whither I have driven you, saith Jehovah;  and I will bring you again into the place whence I have caused  you to be carried away captive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> If ye say, Jehovah hath raised us up prophets in Babylon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> yea, thus saith Jehovah concerning the king that sitteth  upon the throne of David, and concerning all the people that  dwell in this city, your brethren that are not gone forth with  you into captivity;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will send against  them the sword, the famine, and the pestilence, and will make  them like the vile figs, that cannot be eaten for badness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> And I will pursue them with the sword, with the famine,  and with the pestilence, and will give them over to be driven  hither and thither into all the kingdoms of the earth, to be an  execration, and an astonishment, and a hissing, and a reproach,  among all the nations whither I will drive them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> because they have not hearkened to my words, saith  Jehovah, wherewith I sent unto them my servants the prophets,  rising early and sending; but ye have not hearkened, saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> But ye, all ye of the captivity, whom I have sent from  Jerusalem to Babylon, hear the word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, concerning  Ahab the son of Kolaiah, and concerning Zedekiah the son of  Maaseiah, who prophesy falsehood unto you in my name: Behold, I  will give them into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,  and he shall smite them before your eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> And of them shall be taken up a curse by all the captivity  of Judah that are in Babylon, saying, Jehovah make thee like  Zedekiah and like Ahab, whom the king of Babylon roasted in the  fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> because they have committed infamy in Israel, and have  committed adultery with their neighbours' wives, and have  spoken words of falsehood in my name, which I had not commanded  them: and I [am] he that knoweth, and [am] witness, saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> And thou shalt speak to Shemaiah the Nehelamite, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:25">29:25</a> Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying,  Because thou hast sent letters in thy name unto all the people  that are at Jerusalem, and to Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the  priest, and to all the priests, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:26">29:26</a> Jehovah hath made thee priest in the stead of Jehoiada the  priest, that there should be officers [in] the house of  Jehovah, over every madman and self-made prophet, that thou  shouldest put him in the stocks and in the shackles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:27">29:27</a> And now, why hast thou not reproved Jeremiah of Anathoth,  who maketh himself a prophet to you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:28">29:28</a> Forasmuch as he hath sent unto us in Babylon, saying, It  will be long; build houses, and dwell [in them], and plant  gardens, and eat the fruit of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:29">29:29</a> -- And Zephaniah the priest read this letter in the ears  of the prophet Jeremiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:30">29:30</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:31">29:31</a> Send to all them of the captivity, saying, Thus saith  Jehovah concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite: Because that  Shemaiah hath prophesied unto you, and I sent him not, and he  hath caused you to trust in falsehood;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:32">29:32</a> therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will punish  Shemaiah the Nehelamite, and his seed: he shall not have a man  to dwell among this people; neither shall he see the good that  I will do for my people, saith Jehovah; because he hath spoken  revolt against Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> Thus speaketh Jehovah the God of Israel, saying, Write thee  in a book all the words that I have spoken unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> For behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, when I will turn  the captivity of my people Israel and Judah, saith Jehovah; and  I will cause them to return to the land that I gave to their  fathers, and they shall possess it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> And these are the words that Jehovah hath spoken concerning  Israel and concerning Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> for thus saith Jehovah: We have heard a voice of trembling,  there is fear, and no peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> Ask ye now, and see, whether a male doth travail with  child? Wherefore do I see every man with his hands on his  loins, as a woman in travail; and all faces are turned into  paleness?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> Alas! for that day is great, so that none is like it: it is  even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he shall be saved out of  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of  hosts, I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burst  thy bonds, and strangers shall no more reduce him to servitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> But they shall serve Jehovah their God, and David their  king, whom I will raise up unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> And thou, my servant Jacob, fear not, saith Jehovah;  neither be dismayed, O Israel: for behold, I will save thee  from afar, and thy seed from the land of their captivity; and  Jacob shall return, and shall be in rest, and at ease, and none  shall make [him] afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> For I am with thee, saith Jehovah, to save thee: for I  will make a full end of all the nations whither I have  scattered thee; yet of thee will I not make a full end, but I  will correct thee with judgment, and will not hold thee  altogether guiltless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Thy bruise is incurable, thy wound  is grievous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> There is none to plead thy cause, to bind up [thy wound];  thou hast no healing medicines.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> All thy lovers have forgotten thee; they seek thee not.  For I have smitten thee with the stroke of an enemy, with the  chastisement of a cruel one, for the greatness of thine  iniquity: thy sins are manifold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> Why criest thou because of thy bruise? thy sorrow is  incurable; for the greatness of thine iniquity, [because] thy  sins are manifold, I have done these things unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> Therefore all that devour thee shall be devoured, and all  thine adversaries, every one of them, shall go into captivity;  and they that spoil thee shall be for a spoil; and all they  that prey upon thee will I give to be a prey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> For I will apply a bandage unto thee, and I will heal thee  of thy wounds, saith Jehovah; for they have called thee an  outcast: This is Zion that no man seeketh after.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will turn the captivity of  Jacob's tents, and have mercy on his habitations; and the city  shall be built upon her own heap; and the palace shall be  inhabited after the manner thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> And out of them shall proceed thanksgiving, and the voice  of them that make merry: and I will multiply them, and they  shall not be diminished; and I will honour them, and they shall  not be small.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> And their sons shall be as aforetime; and their assembly  shall be established before me; and I will punish all that  oppress them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> And their prince shall be of themselves, and their ruler  shall proceed from the midst of them; and I will cause him to  approach, and he shall draw near unto me. For who is this that  engageth his heart to draw near unto me? saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> And ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> Behold, a tempest of Jehovah, fury is gone forth, a  sweeping storm: it shall whirl down upon the head of the  wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> The fierce anger of Jehovah shall not return, until he  have executed, and until he have performed the purposes of his  heart. At the end of the days ye shall consider it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> At that time, saith Jehovah, will I be the God of all the  families of Israel, and they shall be my people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah: The people [that were] left of the  sword have found grace in the wilderness, [even] Israel, when I  go to give him rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> Jehovah hath appeared from afar unto me, [saying,] Yea, I  have loved thee with an everlasting love; therefore with  loving-kindness have I drawn thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> I will build thee again, and thou shalt be built, O virgin  of Israel! Thou shalt again be adorned with thy tambours, and  shalt go forth in the dances of them that make merry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> Thou shalt again plant vineyards upon the mountains of  Samaria; the planters shall plant, and shall eat the fruit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> For there shall be a day, when the watchmen upon mount  Ephraim shall cry, Arise, and let us go up to Zion, unto  Jehovah our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Sing aloud [with] gladness for  Jacob, and shout at the head of the nations; publish ye, praise  ye, and say, Jehovah, save thy people, the remnant of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> Behold, I bring them from the north country, and gather  them from the uttermost parts of the earth; [and] among them  the blind and the lame, the woman with child and her that  travaileth with child together: a great assemblage shall they  return hither.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> They shall come with weeping, and with supplications will I  lead them; I will cause them to walk by water-brooks, in a  straight way, wherein they shall not stumble; for I will be a  father to Israel, and Ephraim is my firstborn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:10">31:10</a> Hear the word of Jehovah, ye nations, and declare [it] to  the isles afar off, and say, He that scattered Israel will  gather him, and keep him, as a shepherd his flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:11">31:11</a> For Jehovah hath ransomed Jacob, and redeemed him from the  hand of one stronger than he.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:12">31:12</a> And they shall come and sing aloud upon the height of  Zion, and shall flow together to the goodness of Jehovah, for  corn, and for new wine, and for oil, and for the young of the  flock and of the herd; and their soul shall be as a watered  garden, and they shall not languish any more at all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:13">31:13</a> Then shall the virgin rejoice in the dance, and the young  men and old together; for I will turn their mourning into  gladness, and will comfort them, and make them rejoice after  their sorrow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:14">31:14</a> And I will satiate the soul of the priests with fatness,  and my people shall be satisfied with my goodness, saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:15">31:15</a> Thus saith Jehovah: A voice hath been heard in Ramah, the  wail of very bitter weeping, -- Rachel weeping for her  children, refusing to be comforted for her children, because  they are not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:16">31:16</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Refrain thy voice from weeping, and  thine eyes from tears; for there is a reward for thy work,  saith Jehovah; and they shall come again from the land of the  enemy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:17">31:17</a> And there is hope for thy latter end, saith Jehovah, and  thy children shall come again to their own border.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:18">31:18</a> I have indeed heard Ephraim bemoaning himself [thus]: Thou  hast chastised me, and I was chastised as a bullock not  trained: turn thou me, and I shall be turned; for thou art  Jehovah my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:19">31:19</a> Surely after that I was turned, I repented; and after I  knew myself, I smote upon [my] thigh. I was ashamed, yea, even  confounded, for I bear the reproach of my youth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:20">31:20</a> Is Ephraim a dear son unto me? is he a child of delights?  For whilst I have been speaking against him, I do constantly  remember him still. Therefore my bowels are troubled for him: I  will certainly have mercy upon him, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:21">31:21</a> Set up waymarks, make for thyself signposts; set thy heart  toward the highway, the way by which thou wentest: turn again,  O virgin of Israel, turn again to these thy cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:22">31:22</a> How long wilt thou wander about, thou backsliding  daughter? For Jehovah hath created a new thing on the earth, a  woman shall encompass a man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:23">31:23</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: They shall  again use this speech, in the land of Judah and in the cities  thereof, when I shall turn their captivity: Jehovah bless thee,  O habitation of righteousness, mountain of holiness!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:24">31:24</a> And therein shall dwell Judah, and all the cities thereof  together, the husbandmen, and they that go about with flocks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:25">31:25</a> For I have satiated the weary soul, and every languishing  soul have I replenished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:26">31:26</a> -- Upon this I awaked, and beheld; and my sleep was sweet  unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:27">31:27</a> Behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will sow the  house of Israel and the house of Judah [with] the seed of man  and the seed of beast.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:28">31:28</a> And it shall come to pass, as I have watched over them, to  pluck up, and to break down, and to overthrow, and to destroy,  and to afflict; so will I watch over them to build, and to  plant, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:29">31:29</a> In those days they shall say no more, The fathers have  eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:30">31:30</a> for every one shall die for his own iniquity; every man  that eateth the sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:31">31:31</a> Behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will make a new  covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:32">31:32</a> not according to the covenant that I made with their  fathers, in the day of my taking them by the hand, to lead them  out of the land of Egypt; which my covenant they broke,  although I was a husband unto them, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:33">31:33</a> For this is the covenant that I will make with the house  of Israel, after those days, saith Jehovah: I will put my law  in their inward parts, and will write it in their heart; and I  will be their God, and they shall be my people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:34">31:34</a> And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and  every man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for they shall all  know me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them,  saith Jehovah: for I will pardon their iniquity, and their sin  will I remember no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:35">31:35</a> Thus saith Jehovah, who giveth the sun for light by day,  the ordinances of the moon and of the stars for light by night,  who stirreth up the sea so that the waves thereof roar, --  Jehovah of hosts is his name:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:36">31:36</a> If those ordinances depart from before me, saith Jehovah,  the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before  me for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:37">31:37</a> Thus saith Jehovah: If the heavens above can be measured,  and the foundations of the earth searched out beneath, I will  also cast off the whole seed of Israel, for all that they have  done, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:38">31:38</a> Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that the city shall  be built to Jehovah, from the tower of Hananeel unto the  corner-gate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:39">31:39</a> And the measuring line shall yet go forth before it unto  the hill Gareb, and shall turn toward Goath.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:40">31:40</a> And the whole valley of the dead bodies, and of the ashes,  and all the fields unto the torrent Kidron, unto the corner of  the horse-gate toward the east, shall be holy unto Jehovah: it  shall not be plucked up, nor overthrown any more for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the tenth  year of Zedekiah king of Judah: that year was the eighteenth  year of Nebuchadrezzar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> And the king of Babylon's army was then besieging  Jerusalem; and the prophet Jeremiah was shut up in the court of  the guard, which was in the king of Judah's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> For Zedekiah king of Judah had shut him up, saying, Why  dost thou prophesy and say, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I give  this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall  take it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> and Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand  of the Chaldeans; for he shall certainly be given into the hand  of the king of Babylon, and shall speak with him mouth to  mouth, and his eyes shall behold his eyes;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> and he shall lead Zedekiah to Babylon, and there shall he  be until I visit him, saith Jehovah: though ye fight with the  Chaldeans, ye shall not prosper?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> And Jeremiah said, The word of Jehovah came unto me,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> Behold, Hanameel, the son of Shallum thine uncle, shall  come unto thee, saying, Buy for thyself my field which is in  Anathoth; for thine is the right of redemption, to buy [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> And Hanameel, mine uncle's son, came to me in the court of  the guard according to the word of Jehovah, and said unto me,  Buy my field, I pray thee, that is in Anathoth, which is in the  land of Benjamin; for the right of inheritance is thine, and  the redemption is thine: buy [it] for thyself. Then I knew that  this was the word of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> And I bought of Hanameel, mine uncle's son, the field which  is in Anathoth, and weighed him the money, seventeen shekels of  silver.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> And I subscribed the writing, and sealed it, and took  witnesses, and weighed the money in the balances.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> And I took the writing of the purchase, that which was  sealed [according to] the law and the statutes, and that which  was open;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> and I gave the writing of the purchase unto Baruch the son  of Nerijah, the son of Maaseiah, in the sight of Hanameel mine  uncle's [son], and in the presence of the witnesses that had  subscribed the writing of purchase, before all the Jews that  were sitting in the court of the guard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> And I charged Baruch in their presence, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Take these  writings, this writing of the purchase, both that which is  sealed and this writing which is open; and put them in an  earthen vessel, that they may remain many days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Houses  and fields and vineyards shall again be purchased in this land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> And after I had given the writing of the purchase unto  Baruch the son of Nerijah, I prayed unto Jehovah saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> Alas, Lord Jehovah! Behold, thou hast made the heavens and  the earth by thy great power and stretched-out arm; there is  nothing too hard for thee:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> who shewest mercy unto thousands, and recompensest the  iniquity of the fathers into the bosom of their children after  them, thou, the great, the mighty ùGod, -- Jehovah of hosts is  his name;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> great in counsel and mighty in work, whose eyes are open  upon all the ways of the children of men, to give every one  according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his  doings:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> who hast displayed signs and wonders unto this day, in the  land of Egypt and in Israel and among [other] men; and hast  made thee a name, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:21">32:21</a> And thou broughtest forth thy people Israel out of the  land of Egypt by signs, and by wonders, and by a powerful hand,  and by a stretched-out arm, and by great terror;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:22">32:22</a> and didst give them this land, which thou hadst sworn unto  their fathers to give them, a land flowing with milk and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:23">32:23</a> And they came in and possessed it: but they hearkened not  unto thy voice, neither walked in thy law; they have done  nothing of all that thou commandedst them to do; so that thou  hast caused all this evil to come upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:24">32:24</a> Behold the mounds, they are come unto the city for taking  it; and the city is given over into the hand of the Chaldeans,  that fight against it, by the sword, and the famine, and the  pestilence: and what thou hast spoken is come to pass; and  behold, thou seest [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:25">32:25</a> And thou, Lord Jehovah, thou hast said unto me, Buy for  thyself the field for money, and take witnesses; -- and the  city is given into the hand of the Chaldeans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:26">32:26</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:27">32:27</a> Behold, I am Jehovah, the God of all flesh: is there  anything too hard for me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:28">32:28</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I give this city  into the hand of the Chaldeans, and into the hand of  Nebuchadrezzar the king of Babylon, and he shall take it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:29">32:29</a> And the Chaldeans, that fight against this city, shall  come in and set fire to this city, and shall burn it, and the  houses upon whose roofs they have offered incense unto Baal,  and poured out drink-offerings unto other gods, to provoke me  to anger.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:30">32:30</a> For the children of Israel and the children of Judah have  been doing only evil in my sight from their youth; for the  children of Israel have only provoked me to anger with the work  of their hands, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:31">32:31</a> For this city hath been to me [a provocation] of mine  anger and of my fury from the day that they built it even unto  this day; that I should remove it from before my face,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:32">32:32</a> because of all the evil of the children of Israel and of  the children of Judah, which they have done to provoke me to  anger, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and  their prophets, and the men of Judah, and the inhabitants of  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:33">32:33</a> And they have turned unto me the back, and not the face;  and though I taught them, rising early and teaching, they  hearkened not to receive instruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:34">32:34</a> And they have set their abominations in the house which is  called by my name, to defile it;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:35">32:35</a> and they have built the high places of Baal, which are in  the valley of the son of Hinnom, to cause to pass through [the  fire] their sons and their daughters unto Molech: which I  commanded them not, neither came it into my mind, that they  should do this abomination, to cause Judah to sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:36">32:36</a> And now therefore Jehovah, the God of Israel, saith thus  concerning this city, whereof ye say, It hath been given over  into the hand of the king of Babylon by the sword, and by the  famine, and by the pestilence:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:37">32:37</a> Behold, I will gather them out of all the countries  whither I have driven them, in mine anger, and in my fury, and  in great wrath; and I will bring them again unto this place,  and I will cause them to dwell safely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:38">32:38</a> And they shall be my people, and I will be their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:39">32:39</a> And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may  fear me all [their] days, for the good of them, and of their  children after them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:40">32:40</a> And I will make an everlasting covenant with them, that I  will not draw back from them, to do them good; and I will put  my fear in their heart, that they may not turn aside from me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:41">32:41</a> And I will rejoice over them to do them good, and I will  assuredly plant them in this land with my whole heart and with  my whole soul.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:42">32:42</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Like as I have brought all this  great evil upon this people, so will I bring upon them all the  good that I have spoken concerning them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:43">32:43</a> And fields shall be bought in this land, whereof ye say,  It is desolate without man or beast; it is given into the hand  of the Chaldeans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:44">32:44</a> [Men] shall buy fields for money, and subscribe the  writings, and seal them, and take witnesses, in the land of  Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities  of Judah, and in the cities of the hill-country, and in the  cities of the lowland, and in the cities of the south: for I  will turn their captivity, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah the second time,  while he was still shut up in the court of the prison, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah the doer of it, Jehovah that formeth it  to establish it, Jehovah is his name:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and I will shew thee  great and hidden things, which thou knowest not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> For thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel concerning the  houses of this city, and concerning the houses of the kings of  Judah, which are thrown down because of the mounds and because  of the sword:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> They come to fight with the Chaldeans, but to fill them  with the dead bodies of the men whom I have slain in mine anger  and in my fury, and for all whose wickedness I have hid my face  from this city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:6">33:6</a> Behold, I will apply a healing dressing to it and cure, and  I will heal them, and will reveal unto them an abundance of  peace and truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:7">33:7</a> And I will turn the captivity of Judah and the captivity of  Israel, and will build them, as at the beginning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:8">33:8</a> And I will cleanse them from all their iniquity, whereby  they have sinned against me, and I will pardon all their  iniquities, whereby they have sinned against me, and whereby  they have transgressed against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:9">33:9</a> And it shall be to me a name of joy, a praise and a glory  before all the nations of the earth, which shall hear of all  the good that I do unto them; and they shall fear and tremble  for all the good and for all the prosperity that I procure unto  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:10">33:10</a> Thus saith Jehovah: In this place of which ye say, It is  waste, without man and without beast! in the cities of Judah  and in the streets of Jerusalem that are desolate, without man,  and without inhabitant, and without beast,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:11">33:11</a> there shall again be heard the voice of mirth and the  voice of joy, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the  bride, the voice of them that say, Give ye thanks unto Jehovah  of hosts; for Jehovah is good, for his loving-kindness  [endureth] for ever, -- of them that bring thanksgiving unto  the house of Jehovah. For I will turn the captivity of the land  as in the beginning, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:12">33:12</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In this place which is waste,  without man and without beast, and in all the cities thereof,  there shall again be a habitation of shepherds causing [their]  flocks to lie down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:13">33:13</a> In the cities of the hill-country, in the cities of the  lowland, and in the cities of the south, and in the land of  Benjamin, and in the environs of Jerusalem, and in the cities  of Judah, shall the flocks pass again under the hands of him  that counteth [them], saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:14">33:14</a> Behold, the days come, saith Jehovah, that I will perform  the good word which I have spoken unto the house of Israel and  unto the house of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:15">33:15</a> In those days, and at that time, will I cause a Branch of  righteousness to grow up unto David; and he shall execute  judgment and righteousness in the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> In those days shall Judah be saved, and Jerusalem shall  dwell in safety. And this is the name wherewith she shall be  called: Jehovah our Righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:17">33:17</a> For thus saith Jehovah: There shall never fail to David a  man to sit upon the throne of the house of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:18">33:18</a> neither shall there fail to the priests the Levites a man  before me to offer up burnt-offerings, and to burn oblations,  and to do sacrifice continually.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:19">33:19</a> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> Thus saith Jehovah: If ye can break my covenant [in  respect] of the day, and my covenant [in respect] of the night,  so that there should not be day and night in their season,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:21">33:21</a> [then] shall also my covenant be broken with David my  servant, that he should not have a son to reign upon his  throne; and with the Levites, the priests, my ministers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:22">33:22</a> As the host of the heavens cannot be numbered, nor the  sand of the sea measured, so will I multiply the seed of David  my servant, and the Levites that minister unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:23">33:23</a> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:24">33:24</a> Hast thou not seen what this people have spoken, saying,  The two families that Jehovah had chosen, he hath even cast  them off? And they despise my people, that they should be no  more a nation before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:25">33:25</a> Thus saith Jehovah: If my covenant of day and night  [stand] not, if I have not appointed the ordinances of the  heavens and the earth,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:26">33:26</a> [then] will I also cast away the seed of Jacob, and of  David my servant, so as not to take of his seed to be rulers  over the seed of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob: for I will turn  their captivity, and will have mercy on them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:1">34:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, when  Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and all his army, and all the  kingdoms of the earth under his dominion, and all the peoples,  fought against Jerusalem and against all the cities thereof,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:2">34:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah, the God of Israel: Go and speak to  Zedekiah king of Judah, and tell him, Thus saith Jehovah:  Behold, I give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon,  and he shall burn it with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:3">34:3</a> And thou shalt not escape out of his hand, but shalt  certainly be taken, and given into his hand; and thine eyes  shall behold the eyes of the king of Babylon, and his mouth  shall speak with thy mouth, and thou shalt go to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:4">34:4</a> Only, hear the word of Jehovah, O Zedekiah king of Judah.  Thus saith Jehovah as to thee: Thou shalt not die by the sword;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:5">34:5</a> thou shalt die in peace, and with the burnings of thy  fathers, the former kings that were before thee, so shall they  burn for thee; and they will lament for thee, Ah, lord! for I  have spoken the word, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:6">34:6</a> And the prophet Jeremiah spoke all these words unto  Zedekiah king of Judah, in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:7">34:7</a> And the king of Babylon's army fought against Jerusalem,  and against all the cities of Judah that were left, against  Lachish, and against Azekah; for these were amongst the cities  of Judah, the fenced cities that were left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:8">34:8</a> The word that came unto Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that  king Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people that were  at Jerusalem, to proclaim liberty unto them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:9">34:9</a> that every man should let his bondman, and every man his  bondmaid, the Hebrew and the Hebrewess, go free, that none  should exact service of them, [that is,] of a Jew his brother.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:10">34:10</a> And all the princes and all the people that had entered  into the covenant obeyed, every man letting his bondman and  every man his bondmaid go free, that none should exact service  of them any more: they obeyed, and let [them] go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:11">34:11</a> But afterwards they turned, and caused the bondmen and the  bondmaids whom they had let go free, to return, and brought  them into subjection for bondmen and for bondmaids.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:12">34:12</a> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah from Jehovah,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:13">34:13</a> Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: I made a covenant  with your fathers in the day that I brought them forth out of  the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:14">34:14</a> At the end of seven years ye shall let go every man his  brother, a Hebrew, who hath sold himself unto thee; when he  hath served thee six years, thou shalt let him go free from  thee. But your fathers hearkened not unto me, neither inclined  their ear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:15">34:15</a> And you, ye had this day turned, and had done right in my  sight, in proclaiming liberty every man to his neighbour; and  ye had made a covenant before me in the house which is called  by my name:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:16">34:16</a> but ye have turned and profaned my name, and caused every  man his bondman, and every man his bondmaid, whom ye had set at  liberty at their pleasure, to return, and ye have brought them  into subjection, to be unto you for bondmen and for bondmaids.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:17">34:17</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: Ye have not hearkened unto  me, in proclaiming liberty, every man to his brother, and every  man to his neighbour: behold, I proclaim a liberty for you,  saith Jehovah, to the sword, to the pestilence, and to the  famine; and I will give you over to be driven hither and  thither among all the kingdoms of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:18">34:18</a> And I will give the men that have transgressed my  covenant, who have not performed the words of the covenant  which they had made before me, -- the calf which they cut in  twain, and passed between the parts thereof,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:19">34:19</a> -- the princes of Judah and the princes of Jerusalem, the  eunuchs, and the priests, and all the people of the land, that  passed between the parts of the calf;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:20">34:20</a> them will I give into the hand of their enemies and into  the hand of them that seek their life; and their carcases shall  be food for the fowl of the heavens and for the beasts of the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:21">34:21</a> And Zedekiah king of Judah and his princes will I give  into the hand of their enemies, and into the hand of them that  seek their life, and into the hand of the king of Babylon's  army, which are gone up from you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_34:22">34:22</a> Behold, I command, saith Jehovah, and I will cause them to  return to this city; and they shall fight against it, and take  it, and burn it with fire; and I will make the cities of Judah  a desolation, without inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:1">35:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah in the days of  Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:2">35:2</a> Go to the house of the Rechabites, and speak with them, and  bring them into the house of Jehovah, into one of the chambers,  and give them wine to drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:3">35:3</a> And I took Jaazaniah the son of Jeremiah, the son of  Habazziniah, and his brethren, and all his sons, and the whole  house of the Rechabites,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:4">35:4</a> and I brought them into the house of Jehovah, into the  chamber of the sons of Hanan the son of Igdaliah, the man of  God, which was by the chamber of the princes, which was above  the chamber of Maaseiah the son of Shallum, the keeper of the  threshold.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:5">35:5</a> And I set before the sons of the house of the Rechabites  bowls full of wine, and cups, and I said unto them, Drink wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:6">35:6</a> And they said, We will drink no wine; for Jonadab the son  of Rechab our father commanded us, saying, Ye shall drink no  wine, ye nor your sons for ever;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:7">35:7</a> neither shall ye build house, nor sow seed, nor plant  vineyard, nor shall ye have [any]; but all your days ye shall  dwell in tents, that ye may live many days in the land where ye  sojourn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:8">35:8</a> And we have hearkened unto the voice of Jonadab the son of  Rechab our father in all that he commanded us, to drink no wine  all our days, we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:9">35:9</a> and not to build houses for us to dwell in; neither have we  vineyard, nor field, nor seed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:10">35:10</a> but we have dwelt in tents, and have obeyed and done  according to all that Jonadab our father commanded us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:11">35:11</a> And it came to pass when Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon  came up into the land, that we said, Come and let us go into  Jerusalem because of the army of the Chaldeans, and because of  the army of Syria; and we dwell at Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:12">35:12</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:13">35:13</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Go and say  to the men of Judah and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, Will  ye not receive instruction to hearken unto my words? saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:14">35:14</a> The words of Jonadab the son of Rechab, that he commanded  his sons not to drink wine, are performed; and to this day they  have drunk none, for they have obeyed their father's  commandment. But I have spoken unto you, rising early and  speaking, and ye have not hearkened unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:15">35:15</a> And I have sent unto you all my servants the prophets,  rising early and sending, saying, Return ye now every man from  his evil way, and amend your doings, and go not after other  gods to serve them; and ye shall dwell in the land that I have  given to you and to your fathers: but ye have not inclined your  ear nor hearkened unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:16">35:16</a> Yea, the sons of Jonadab the son of Rechab have performed  the commandment of their father which he commanded them, but  this people hath not hearkened unto me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:17">35:17</a> therefore thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the God of  Israel: Behold, I will bring upon Judah and upon all the  inhabitants of Jerusalem all the evil that I have pronounced  against them, because I have spoken unto them, but they have  not hearkened, and I have called unto them, but they have not  answered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:18">35:18</a> And Jeremiah said unto the house of the Rechabites, Thus  saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Because ye have  obeyed the commandment of Jonadab your father, and kept all his  injunctions, and have done according unto all that he hath  commanded you;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_35:19">35:19</a> therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel,  There shall not fail to Jonadab the son of Rechab a man to  stand before me, for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:1">36:1</a> And it came to pass in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son  of Josiah, the king of Judah, [that] this word came to Jeremiah  from Jehovah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:2">36:2</a> Take thee a roll of a book, and write therein all the words  that I have spoken unto thee against Israel, and against Judah,  and against all the nations, from the day I spoke unto thee,  from the days of Josiah, even unto this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> It may be the house of Judah will hear all the evil that I  purpose to do unto them, that they may return every man from  his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity and their  sin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> And Jeremiah called Baruch the son of Nerijah; and Baruch  wrote from the mouth of Jeremiah all the words of Jehovah,  which he had spoken unto him, upon a roll of a book.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> And Jeremiah commanded Baruch, saying, I am shut up, I  cannot go into the house of Jehovah; but go thou in,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> and read in the roll, which thou hast written from my  mouth, the words of Jehovah in the ears of the people in the  house of Jehovah upon the fast day; and thou shalt also read  them in the ears of all Judah that come from their cities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:7">36:7</a> It may be they will present their supplication before  Jehovah, and that they will return every one from his evil way;  for great is the anger and the fury that Jehovah hath  pronounced against this people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:8">36:8</a> And Baruch the son of Nerijah did according to all that the  prophet Jeremiah commanded him, reading in the book the words  of Jehovah in Jehovah's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:9">36:9</a> And it came to pass in the fifth year of Jehoiakim the son  of Josiah, the king of Judah, in the ninth month, [that] they  proclaimed a fast before Jehovah, for all the people in  Jerusalem, and for all the people that came from the cities of  Judah to Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:10">36:10</a> And Baruch read in the book the words of Jeremiah in the  house of Jehovah, in the chamber of Gemariah the son of Shaphan  the scribe, in the upper court, at the entry of the new gate of  the house of Jehovah, in the ears of all the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> And Micah the son of Gemariah the son of Shaphan heard out  of the book all the words of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> and he went down to the king's house, into the scribe's  chamber, and behold, all the princes were sitting there:  Elishama the scribe, and Delaiah the son of Shemaiah, and  Elnathan the son of Achbor, and Gemariah the son of Shaphan,  and Zedekiah the son of Hananiah, and all the princes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> And Micah declared unto them all the words that he had  heard, when Baruch read in the book in the ears of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:14">36:14</a> And all the princes sent Jehudi the son of Nethaniah, the  son of Shelemiah, the son of Cushi, unto Baruch, saying, Take  in thy hand the roll in which thou hast read in the ears of the  people, and come. And Baruch the son of Nerijah took the roll  in his hand, and came unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:15">36:15</a> And they said unto him, Sit down now, and read it in our  ears. And Baruch read [it] in their ears.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:16">36:16</a> And it came to pass, when they heard all the words, they  turned in fear one toward another, and said unto Baruch, We  will certainly report to the king all these words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> And they asked Baruch, saying, Tell us now, How didst thou  write all these words from his mouth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:18">36:18</a> And Baruch said unto them, He pronounced all these words  unto me with his mouth, and I wrote [them] with ink in the  book.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:19">36:19</a> And the princes said unto Baruch, Go, hide thee, thou and  Jeremiah; that none may know where ye are.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:20">36:20</a> And they went in unto the king into the court, but they  laid up the roll in the chamber of Elishama the scribe; and  they told all the words in the ears of the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:21">36:21</a> And the king sent Jehudi to fetch the roll, and he fetched  it out of the chamber of Elishama the scribe. And Jehudi read  it in the ears of the king, and in the ears of all the princes  that stood beside the king.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:22">36:22</a> Now the king was sitting in the winter-house in the ninth  month, and with the fire-pan burning before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:23">36:23</a> And it came to pass, that when Jehudi had read three or  four columns, he cut it with the scribe's knife, and cast it  into the fire that was in the pan until all the roll was  consumed in the fire that was in the pan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:24">36:24</a> And they were not afraid, nor rent their garments,  [neither] the king nor any of his servants that heard all these  words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:25">36:25</a> Moreover, Elnathan and Delaiah and Gemariah had made  intercession to the king that he would not burn the roll; but  he would not hear them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:26">36:26</a> And the king commanded Jerahmeel the son of Hammelech, and  Seraiah the son of Azriel, and Shelemiah the son of Abdeel, to  take Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet; but Jehovah  hid them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:27">36:27</a> And after that the king had burned the roll, and the words  that Baruch wrote at the mouth of Jeremiah, the word of Jehovah  came to Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:28">36:28</a> Take thee again another roll, and write in it all the  former words that were in the first roll which Jehoiakim the  king of Judah hath burned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:29">36:29</a> And thou shalt say to Jehoiakim king of Judah, Thus saith  Jehovah: Thou hast burned this roll, saying, Why hast thou  written therein, saying, The king of Babylon shall certainly  come and destroy this land, and shall cause to cease from it  man and beast?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:30">36:30</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning Jehoiakim king of  Judah: He shall have none to sit upon the throne of David; and  his dead body shall be cast out in the day to the heat, and in  the night to the frost.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:31">36:31</a> And I will visit their iniquity upon him, and upon his  seed, and upon his servants; and I will bring upon them, and  upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and upon the men of Judah,  all the evil that I have pronounced against them; and they have  not hearkened.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:32">36:32</a> And Jeremiah took another roll, and gave it to Baruch the  scribe, the son of Nerijah; and he wrote therein from the mouth  of Jeremiah, all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of  Judah had burned in the fire; and there were added besides unto  them many like words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:1">37:1</a> And king Zedekiah the son of Josiah reigned instead of  Coniah the son of Jehoiakim, Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon  having made him king in the land of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:2">37:2</a> And neither he, nor his servants, nor the people of the  land, hearkened unto the words of Jehovah, which he had spoken  through the prophet Jeremiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:3">37:3</a> And Zedekiah the king sent Jehucal the son of Shelemiah,  and Zephaniah the son of Maaseiah the priest to the prophet  Jeremiah, saying, Pray now unto Jehovah our God for us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:4">37:4</a> And Jeremiah came in and went out among the people; for  they had not put him into prison.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:5">37:5</a> And Pharaoh's army was come forth out of Egypt; and when  the Chaldeans that besieged Jerusalem heard tidings of them,  they went up from Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:6">37:6</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah the prophet,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:7">37:7</a> Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel: Thus shall ye say to  the king of Judah, that sent you unto me to inquire of me:  Behold, Pharaoh's army, which is come forth to help you, shall  return to Egypt into their own land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:8">37:8</a> And the Chaldeans shall come again, and fight against this  city, and take it, and burn it with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:9">37:9</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Deceive not yourselves, saying, The  Chaldeans are certainly gone away from us; for they are not  gone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:10">37:10</a> For though ye had smitten the whole army of the Chaldeans  that fight against you, and there remained [but] wounded men  among them, [yet] should they rise up every man in his tent,  and burn this city with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:11">37:11</a> And it came to pass when the army of the Chaldeans was  gone up from Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:12">37:12</a> that Jeremiah went forth out of Jerusalem to go into the  land of Benjamin, to have his portion there among the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:13">37:13</a> And when he was in the gate of Benjamin, a captain of the  guard was there whose name was Irijah, the son of Shelemiah,  the son of Hananiah; and he laid hold on the prophet Jeremiah,  saying, Thou art deserting to the Chaldeans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:14">37:14</a> And Jeremiah said, It is false: I am not deserting to the  Chaldeans. But he hearkened not to him; and Irijah laid hold on  Jeremiah, and brought him to the princes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:15">37:15</a> And the princes were wroth with Jeremiah, and smote him,  and put him in the place of confinement in the house of  Jonathan the scribe: for they had made that the prison.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:16">37:16</a> When Jeremiah was come into the dungeon and into the  vaults, and Jeremiah had remained there many days,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:17">37:17</a> king Zedekiah sent and took him out. And the king asked of  him secretly in his house, and said, Is there any word from  Jehovah? And Jeremiah said, There is; and he said, Thou shalt  be given into the hand of the king of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:18">37:18</a> And Jeremiah said unto king Zedekiah, What have I offended  against thee, or against thy servants, or against this people,  that ye have put me in the prison?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:19">37:19</a> And where are your prophets that prophesied unto you,  saying, The king of Babylon shall not come against you, nor  against this land?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:20">37:20</a> And now hear, I pray thee, my lord, O king: let my  supplication, I pray thee, come before thee; and cause me not  to return into the house of Jonathan the scribe, lest I die  there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:21">37:21</a> Then Zedekiah the king commanded, and they committed  Jeremiah into the court of the guard, and they gave him daily a  loaf of bread out of the bakers' street, until all the bread in  the city was spent. And Jeremiah abode in the court of the  guard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:1">38:1</a> And Shephatiah the son of Mattan, and Gedaliah the son of  Pashur, and Jucal the son of Shelemiah, and Pashur the son of  Malchijah, heard the words that Jeremiah had spoken unto all  the people, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:2">38:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah: He that remaineth in this city shall  die by the sword, by the famine, and by the pestilence; but he  that goeth forth to the Chaldeans shall live; and he shall have  his life for a prey, and shall live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:3">38:3</a> Thus saith Jehovah: This city shall certainly be given into  the hand of the king of Babylon's army, and he shall take it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:4">38:4</a> And the princes said unto the king, Let this man, we pray  thee, be put to death; for why should he weaken the hands of  the men of war that remain in this city, and the hands of all  the people, in speaking to them according to these words? for  this man seeketh not the welfare of this people, but the hurt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:5">38:5</a> And king Zedekiah said, Behold, he is in your hand; for the  king is not he that can do a thing against you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:6">38:6</a> Then they took Jeremiah, and cast him into the dungeon of  Malchijah the son of Hammelech, which was in the court of the  guard, and they let down Jeremiah with cords. And in the  dungeon there was no water, but mire; and Jeremiah sank in the  mire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:7">38:7</a> And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who was in the  king's house, heard that they had put Jeremiah in the dungeon  -- now the king was sitting in the gate of Benjamin,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> -- and Ebed-melech went forth out of the king's house, and  spoke to the king, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:9">38:9</a> My lord, O king, these men have done evil in all that they  have done to the prophet Jeremiah, whom they have cast into the  dungeon; and he will die by reason of the famine in the place  where he is; for there is no more bread in the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:10">38:10</a> And the king commanded Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying,  Take from hence thirty men with thee, and take up Jeremiah the  prophet out of the dungeon, before he die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:11">38:11</a> And Ebed-melech took the men under his order, and went  into the house of the king under the treasury, and took thence  old shreds and worn-out clothes, and let them down by cords  into the dungeon to Jeremiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:12">38:12</a> And Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, Put, I  pray, [these] old shreds and rags under thine armholes under  the cords. And Jeremiah did so.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:13">38:13</a> And they drew up Jeremiah with cords, and brought him up  out of the dungeon; and Jeremiah remained in the court of the  guard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:14">38:14</a> And king Zedekiah sent and took the prophet Jeremiah unto  him, into the third entry that is in the house of Jehovah; and  the king said unto Jeremiah, I will ask thee a thing: hide  nothing from me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:15">38:15</a> And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, If I declare [it] unto  thee, wilt thou not certainly put me to death? and if I give  thee counsel, thou wilt not hearken unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:16">38:16</a> And king Zedekiah swore secretly unto Jeremiah, saying,  [As] Jehovah liveth, that made us this soul, I will not put  thee to death, neither will I give thee into the hand of these  men that seek thy life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:17">38:17</a> And Jeremiah said unto Zedekiah, Thus saith Jehovah the  God of hosts, the God of Israel: If thou wilt freely go forth  to the king of Babylon's princes, then thy soul shall live, and  this city shall not be burned with fire; and thou shalt live,  and thy house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:18">38:18</a> But if thou wilt not go forth to the king of Babylon's  princes, then shall this city be given into the hand of the  Chaldeans, and they shall burn it with fire, and thou shalt not  escape out of their hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:19">38:19</a> And king Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah, I am afraid of the  Jews that have deserted to the Chaldeans, lest they give me  over into their hand, and they mock me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:20">38:20</a> And Jeremiah said, They shall not give [thee] over.  Hearken, I beseech thee, unto the voice of Jehovah, in that  which I speak unto thee; so shall it be well unto thee, and thy  soul shall live.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:21">38:21</a> But if thou refuse to go forth, this is the word which  Jehovah hath shewn me:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:22">38:22</a> Behold, all the women that are left in the king of Judah's  house shall be brought forth to the king of Babylon's princes;  and they shall say, Thy familiar friends have set thee on, and  have prevailed over thee; thy feet are sunk in the mire, they  are turned away back.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:23">38:23</a> And they shall bring out all thy wives and thy children to  the Chaldeans, and thou shalt not escape out of their hand; for  thou shalt be taken by the hand of the king of Babylon, and  thou shalt cause this city to be burned with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:24">38:24</a> And Zedekiah said unto Jeremiah, Let no man know of these  words, and thou shalt not die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:25">38:25</a> And if the princes hear that I have talked with thee, and  they come unto thee, and say unto thee, Declare unto us now  what thou hast said unto the king, hide it not from us, and we  will not put thee to death; and what hath the king said unto  thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:26">38:26</a> then thou shalt say unto them, I presented my supplication  before the king, that he would not cause me to return to  Jonathan's house, to die there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:27">38:27</a> -- And all the princes came to Jeremiah, and asked him;  and he told them according to all these words that the king had  commanded. And they withdrew quietly from him; for the matter  was not reported.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:28">38:28</a> And Jeremiah remained in the court of the guard until the  day that Jerusalem was taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:1">39:1</a> And it came to pass when Jerusalem was taken, in the ninth  year of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the tenth month, came  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon and all his army against  Jerusalem, and they besieged it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:2">39:2</a> In the eleventh year of Zedekiah, in the fourth month, on  the ninth of the month, the city was broken into;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:3">39:3</a> and all the princes of the king of Babylon came in, and sat  in the middle gate: Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebu, Sarsechim,  chief chamberlain, Nergal-sharezer, chief magian, and all the  rest of the princes of the king of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:4">39:4</a> And it came to pass when Zedekiah the king of Judah and all  the men of war saw them, that they fled, and went forth out of  the city by night, by the way of the king's garden, by the gate  between the two walls; and he went out the way of the plain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:5">39:5</a> And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after them, and  overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and they took him,  and brought him up to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, unto  Riblah in the land of Hamath; and he pronounced judgment upon  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:6">39:6</a> And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah in  Riblah before his eyes, and the king of Babylon slaughtered all  the nobles of Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:7">39:7</a> and he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with  chains of brass, to carry him to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:8">39:8</a> And the Chaldeans burned the king's house and the houses of  the people with fire, and broke down the walls of Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:9">39:9</a> And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried away  captive into Babylon the rest of the people that were left in  the city, and the deserters that had deserted to him, with the  rest of the people that were left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:10">39:10</a> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard left  [certain] of the people, the poor who had nothing, in the land  of Judah, and gave them vineyards and fields at the same time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:11">39:11</a> And Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon had given charge  concerning Jeremiah by Nebuzar-adan the captain of the  body-guard, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:12">39:12</a> Take him, and keep an eye upon him, and do him no harm;  but do unto him even as he shall say unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:13">39:13</a> So Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard sent, and  Nebushazban, chief chamberlain, and Nergal-sharezer, chief  magian, and all the king of Babylon's princes,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:14">39:14</a> even they sent, and took Jeremiah out of the court of the  guard and committed him to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son  of Shaphan, that he should conduct him away home. And he dwelt  among the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:15">39:15</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah, while he was  shut up in the court of the guard, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:16">39:16</a> Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, saying, Thus  saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Behold, I will bring  my words upon this city for evil, and not for good, and they  shall come to pass before thy face in that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:17">39:17</a> And I will deliver thee in that day, saith Jehovah; and  thou shalt not be given into the hand of the men of whom thou  art afraid;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_39:18">39:18</a> for I will certainly save thee, and thou shalt not fall by  the sword, but thou shalt have thy life for a prey; for thou  hast put thy confidence in me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:1">40:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, after that  Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard had let him go from  Ramah, when he had taken him, being bound in chains, among all  the captivity of Jerusalem and Judah, that were carried away  captive to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:2">40:2</a> And the captain of the body-guard took Jeremiah, and said  unto him, Jehovah thy God pronounced this evil upon this place,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:3">40:3</a> and Jehovah hath brought [it about] and done according as  he said; for ye have sinned against Jehovah, and have not  hearkened unto his voice, therefore this thing is come upon  you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:4">40:4</a> And now, behold, I loose thee this day from the chains that  are upon thy hand. If it seem good in thy sight to come with me  to Babylon, come, and I will keep mine eye upon thee; but if it  seem ill unto thee to come with me to Babylon, forbear. See,  all the land is before thee: whither it seemeth good and right  in thy sight to go, thither go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:5">40:5</a> And while he had not yet given answer; [he said,] Yea, go  back to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan, whom the  king of Babylon hath appointed over the cities of Judah, and  abide with him in the midst of the people; or go wheresoever it  seemeth right in thy sight to go. And the captain of the  body-guard gave him provisions and a present, and let him go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:6">40:6</a> And Jeremiah came unto Gedaliah the son of Ahikam to  Mizpah, and abode with him among the people that remained in  the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:7">40:7</a> And all the captains of the forces that were in the fields,  they and their men, heard that the king of Babylon had  appointed Gedaliah the son of Ahikam over the land, and had  committed unto him men, and women, and children, and of the  poor of the land, of them that had not been carried away  captive to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:8">40:8</a> And they came to Gedaliah to Mizpah; even Ishmael the son  of Nethaniah, and Johanan and Jonathan the sons of Kareah, and  Seraiah the son of Tanhumeth, and the sons of Ephai the  Netophathite, and Jezaniah the son of a Maachathite, they and  their men.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:9">40:9</a> And Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan swore  unto them and to their men, saying, Fear not to serve the  Chaldeans: dwell in the land, and serve the king of Babylon,  and it shall be well with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:10">40:10</a> And as for me, behold, I dwell at Mizpah, to stand before  the Chaldeans, who will come unto us; and ye, gather wine, and  summer fruits, and oil, and put [them] in your vessels, and  dwell in your cities which ye have taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:11">40:11</a> Likewise all the Jews that were in Moab, and among the  children of Ammon and in Edom, and that were in all the lands,  heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant in Judah, and  that he had appointed over them Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the  son of Shaphan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:12">40:12</a> and all the Jews returned out of all the places whither  they had been driven, and came to the land of Judah to  Gedaliah, unto Mizpah, and gathered wine and summer fruits in  great abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:13">40:13</a> And Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the  forces that were in the fields, came to Gedaliah unto Mizpah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:14">40:14</a> and said unto him, Dost thou indeed know that Baalis the  king of the children of Ammon hath sent Ishmael the son of  Nethaniah to smite thee to death? But Gedaliah the son of  Ahikam believed them not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:15">40:15</a> And Johanan the son of Kareah spoke to Gedaliah in Mizpah  secretly, saying, Let me go, I pray thee, and I will smite  Ishmael the son of Nethaniah and no man shall know it: why  should he take thy life, and all they of Judah who are gathered  unto thee be scattered, and the remnant of Judah perish?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_40:16">40:16</a> But Gedaliah the son of Ahikam said unto Johanan the son  of Kareah, Thou shalt not do this thing; for thou speakest  falsely of Ishmael.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:1">41:1</a> And it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the  son of Nethaniah the son of Elishama, of the royal seed, and  [one] of the king's chief men, and ten men with him, came to  Gedaliah the son of Ahikam unto Mizpah, and there they ate  bread together, in Mizpah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:2">41:2</a> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah arose, and the ten men  that were with him, and smote Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the  son of Shaphan with the sword, and killed him, whom the king of  Babylon had appointed over the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:3">41:3</a> And Ishmael smote all the Jews that were with him, with  Gedaliah, at Mizpah, and the Chaldeans that were found there,  the men of war.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:4">41:4</a> And it came to pass the second day after he had killed  Gedaliah, and no man knew it,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:5">41:5</a> that there came men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from  Samaria, eighty men, having their beards shaven and their  clothes rent, and having cut themselves; with oblations and  incense in their hand, to bring them to the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:6">41:6</a> And Ishmael the son of Nethaniah went forth from Mizpah to  meet them, weeping all along as he went; and it came to pass  when he met them, he said unto them, Come to Gedaliah the son  of Ahikam.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:7">41:7</a> And it was so, when they came into the midst of the city,  that Ishmael the son of Nethaniah, he and the men that were  with him, slew them, [and cast them] into the midst of the pit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:8">41:8</a> But ten men were found among them that said unto Ishmael,  Do not kill us, for we have hidden stores in the field, of  wheat, and of barley, and of oil, and of honey. So he forbore,  and did not kill them among their brethren.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:9">41:9</a> And the pit into which Ishmael had cast all the dead bodies  of the men whom he had slain by the side of Gedaliah was the  one which Asa the king had made for fear of Baasha king of  Israel: Ishmael the son of Nethaniah filled it with the slain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:10">41:10</a> And Ishmael carried away captive all the remnant of the  people that were in Mizpah, the king's daughters, and all the  people that remained in Mizpah, whom Nebuzar-adan the captain  of the body-guard had committed to Gedaliah the son of Ahikam:  Ishmael the son of Nethaniah carried them away captive, and  departed to go over to the children of Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:11">41:11</a> And Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the  forces that were with him, heard of all the evil that Ishmael  the son of Nethaniah had done;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:12">41:12</a> and they took all the men, and went to fight with Ishmael  the son of Nethaniah, and found him by the great waters that  are at Gibeon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:13">41:13</a> And it came to pass when all the people that were with  Ishmael saw Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of  the forces that were with him, then they were glad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:14">41:14</a> And all the people that Ishmael had carried away captive  from Mizpah turned about and came back, and went to Johanan the  son of Kareah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:15">41:15</a> But Ishmael the son of Nethaniah escaped from Johanan with  eight men, and went to the children of Ammon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:16">41:16</a> Then Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of  the forces that were with him, took all the remnant of the  people whom he had recovered from Ishmael the son of Nethaniah,  from Mizpah, after he had slain Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the  mighty men of war, and the women, and the children, and the  eunuchs, whom he had brought again from Gibeon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:17">41:17</a> and they departed, and dwelt at Geruth-Chimham, which is  by Bethlehem, to go to enter into Egypt,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_41:18">41:18</a> because of the Chaldeans; for they feared them, because  Ishmael the son of Nethaniah had smitten Gedaliah the son of  Ahikam, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:1">42:1</a> And all the captains of the forces, and Johanan the son of  Kareah, and Jezaniah the son of Hoshaiah, and all the people  from the least even to the greatest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:2">42:2</a> came near and said unto Jeremiah the prophet, Let, we  beseech thee, our supplication come before thee, and pray for  us unto Jehovah thy God, for all this remnant (for we are left  a few of many, as thine eyes do behold us);</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:3">42:3</a> that Jehovah thy God may shew us the way wherein we should  walk, and the thing that we should do.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:4">42:4</a> And Jeremiah the prophet said unto them, I have heard;  behold, I will pray unto Jehovah your God according to your  words; and it shall come to pass [that] whatsoever thing  Jehovah shall answer you, I will declare it unto you: I will  keep nothing back from you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:5">42:5</a> And they said to Jeremiah, Jehovah be a true and faithful  witness amongst us, if we do not even according to all the word  for which Jehovah thy God shall send thee to us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:6">42:6</a> Whether it be good or whether it be evil, we will hearken  unto the voice of Jehovah our God, to whom we send thee; that  it may be well with us when we hearken unto the voice of  Jehovah our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:7">42:7</a> And it came to pass at the end of ten days, that the word  of Jehovah came unto Jeremiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:8">42:8</a> And he called Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the  captains of the forces that were with him, and all the people  from the least even unto the greatest,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:9">42:9</a> and said unto them, Thus saith Jehovah the God of Israel,  to whom ye sent me to present your supplication before him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:10">42:10</a> If ye will still abide in this land, then will I build  you, and not overthrow [you], and I will plant you, and not  pluck [you] up; for I repent me of the evil that I have done  unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:11">42:11</a> Be not afraid of the king of Babylon, of whom ye are  afraid: be not afraid of him, saith Jehovah; for I will be with  you to save you, and to deliver you from his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:12">42:12</a> And I will grant mercies to you, that he may have mercy  upon you, and cause you to return to your own land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:13">42:13</a> But if ye say, We will not dwell in this land; so as not  to hearken unto the voice of Jehovah your God,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:14">42:14</a> saying, No; but we will go into the land of Egypt, where  we shall see no war, nor hear the sound of the trumpet, nor  have hunger for bread; and there will we dwell;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:15">42:15</a> -- and now, therefore, hear the word of Jehovah, ye  remnant of Judah: thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of  Israel: If ye really set your faces to enter into Egypt, and go  to sojourn there,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:16">42:16</a> then it shall come to pass, that the sword which ye fear  shall overtake you there in the land of Egypt, and the famine,  whereof ye are afraid, shall follow hard after you there in  Egypt; and there ye shall die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:17">42:17</a> And it shall be that all the men that have set their faces  to go into Egypt to sojourn there shall die by the sword, by  the famine, and by the pestilence; and none of them shall  remain or escape from the evil that I will bring upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:18">42:18</a> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: As  mine anger and my fury have been poured forth upon the  inhabitants of Jerusalem, so shall my fury be poured forth upon  you, when ye shall enter into Egypt; and ye shall be an  execration, and an astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach,  and ye shall see this place no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:19">42:19</a> Jehovah hath said concerning you, the remnant of Judah, Go  ye not into Egypt. Know certainly that I have admonished you  this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:20">42:20</a> For ye deceived yourselves in your own souls, when ye sent  me unto Jehovah your God, saying, Pray for us unto Jehovah our  God; and according to all that Jehovah our God shall say, so  declare unto us, and we will do it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:21">42:21</a> And I have this day declared [it] to you; but ye have not  obeyed the voice of Jehovah your God, nor anything for which he  hath sent me unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_42:22">42:22</a> And now know certainly that ye shall die by the sword, by  the famine, and by the pestilence, in the place whither ye  desire to go to sojourn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:1">43:1</a> And it came to pass, when Jeremiah had ended speaking unto  all the people all the words of Jehovah their God, with which  Jehovah their God had sent him to them -- all these words,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:2">43:2</a> -- then spoke Azariah the son of Hoshaiah, and Johanan the  son of Kareah, and all the proud men, saying to Jeremiah, Thou  speakest falsely: Jehovah our God hath not sent thee to say, Go  not into Egypt to sojourn there;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:3">43:3</a> but Baruch the son of Nerijah is setting thee on against  us, to deliver us into the hand of the Chaldeans, that they may  put us to death, and carry us away captives into Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:4">43:4</a> So Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the  forces, and all the people, hearkened not unto the voice of  Jehovah to abide in the land of Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:5">43:5</a> but Johanan the son of Kareah, and all the captains of the  forces, took all the remnant of Judah, that were returned from  all nations whither they had been driven, to sojourn in the  land of Judah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:6">43:6</a> men, and women, and children, and the king's daughters, and  every person that Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard  had left with Gedaliah the son of Ahikam the son of Shaphan,  and Jeremiah the prophet, and Baruch the son of Nerijah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:7">43:7</a> and they came into the land of Egypt: for they hearkened  not unto the voice of Jehovah. And they came as far as  Tahpanhes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:8">43:8</a> And the word of Jehovah came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes,  saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:9">43:9</a> Take great stones in thy hand, and hide them in the clay in  the brick-kiln, which is at the entry of Pharaoh's house in  Tahpanhes, in the sight of the Jews,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:10">43:10</a> and say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of  Israel: Behold, I will send and take Nebuchadrezzar the king of  Babylon, my servant, and will set his throne upon these stones  which I have hidden, and he shall spread his royal pavilion  over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:11">43:11</a> And he shall come and smite the land of Egypt: such as are  for death to death, and such as are for captivity to captivity;  and such as are for the sword to the sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:12">43:12</a> And I will kindle a fire in the houses of the gods of  Egypt, and he shall burn them, and carry them away captive; and  he shall array himself with the land of Egypt, as a shepherd  putteth on his garment; and he shall go forth from thence in  peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_43:13">43:13</a> And he shall break the pillars of Beth-shemesh, which is  in the land of Egypt; and the houses of the gods of Egypt shall  he burn with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:1">44:1</a> The word that came to Jeremiah concerning all the Jews who  dwelt in the land of Egypt, who dwelt at Migdol, and at  Tahpanhes, and at Noph, and in the country of Pathros, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:2">44:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel: Ye have  seen all the evil that I have brought upon Jerusalem, and upon  all the cities of Judah; and behold they are, this day, a  waste, and no man dwelleth therein,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:3">44:3</a> because of their wickedness which they have committed to  provoke me to anger, in that they went to burn incense to serve  other gods which they knew not, they, [nor] ye, nor your  fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:4">44:4</a> And I sent unto you all my servants the prophets, rising  early and sending, saying, Oh, do not this abominable thing  which I hate!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:5">44:5</a> But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear to turn from  their wickedness, to burn no incense unto other gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:6">44:6</a> And my fury and mine anger was poured forth, and was  kindled in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem;  and they are become a waste, a desolation, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:7">44:7</a> And now thus saith Jehovah the God of hosts, the God of  Israel: Wherefore commit ye great evil against your souls, to  cut off from you man and woman, infant and suckling, out of the  midst of Judah, to leave you no remnant;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:8">44:8</a> provoking me to anger with the works of your hands, burning  incense unto other gods in the land of Egypt, whither ye are  come to sojourn, that ye should be cut off, and that ye should  be a curse and a reproach among all the nations of the earth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:9">44:9</a> Have ye forgotten the wickedness of your fathers, and the  wickedness of the kings of Judah, and the wickedness of their  wives, and your own wickedness, and the wickedness of your  wives, which they have committed in the land of Judah and in  the streets of Jerusalem?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:10">44:10</a> They are not humbled unto this day, neither have they  feared, nor walked in my law, nor in my statutes which I set  before you and before your fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:11">44:11</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel:  Behold, I will set my face against you for evil, and to cut off  all Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:12">44:12</a> And I will take the remnant of Judah, that have set their  faces to enter into the land of Egypt to sojourn there, and  they shall all be consumed: in the land of Egypt shall they  fall; they shall be consumed by the sword [and] by the famine,  from the least even unto the greatest; they shall die by the  sword and by the famine, and they shall be an execration, an  astonishment, and a curse, and a reproach.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:13">44:13</a> And I will punish them that dwell in the land of Egypt as  I have punished Jerusalem, by the sword, by the famine, and by  the pestilence;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:14">44:14</a> and none of the remnant of Judah, that have come into the  land of Egypt to sojourn there, shall escape or remain, so as  to return into the land of Judah, whither they have a desire to  return to dwell there; for none shall return but such as shall  escape.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:15">44:15</a> Then all the men who knew that their wives burned incense  to other gods, and all the women who stood by, a great  assemblage, even all the people that dwelt in the land of  Egypt, in Pathros, answered Jeremiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:16">44:16</a> [As for] the word that thou hast spoken unto us in the  name of Jehovah, we will not hearken unto thee,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:17">44:17</a> but we will certainly do every word that is gone forth out  of our mouth, to burn incense to the queen of the heavens, and  to pour out drink-offerings to her, as we have done, we and our  fathers, our kings and our princes, in the cities of Judah and  in the streets of Jerusalem; and we had plenty of bread, and  were well, and saw no evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:18">44:18</a> But since we left off burning incense to the queen of the  heavens, and pouring out drink-offerings to her, we have wanted  everything, and have been consumed by the sword and by the  famine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:19">44:19</a> And when we burned incense to the queen of the heavens and  poured out drink-offerings to her, did we make for her cakes to  portray her, and pour out drink-offerings to her, without our  husbands?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:20">44:20</a> And Jeremiah said unto all the people, to the men, and to  the women, and to all the people that had given him that  answer, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:21">44:21</a> Is it not the incense that ye burned in the cities of  Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem, ye and your fathers,  your kings and your princes and the people of the land, that  Jehovah remembered, and that came into his mind?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:22">44:22</a> And Jehovah could no longer bear, because of the evil of  your doings, [and] because of the abominations that ye had  committed; and your land is become a waste, and an  astonishment, and a curse, without inhabitant, as at this day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:23">44:23</a> Because ye have burned incense, and because ye have sinned  against Jehovah, and have not hearkened unto the voice of  Jehovah, nor walked in his law, nor in his statutes, nor in his  testimonies; therefore this evil hath come upon you, as at this  day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:24">44:24</a> And Jeremiah said unto all the people, and to all the  women, Hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that are in the  land of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:25">44:25</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, saying, Ye  and your wives have both spoken with your mouths, and fulfilled  with your hands, saying, We will certainly perform our vows  which we have vowed, to burn incense to the queen of the  heavens, and to pour out drink-offerings unto her. Ye will  certainly establish your vows, and entirely perform your vows.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:26">44:26</a> Therefore hear ye the word of Jehovah, all Judah that  dwell in the land of Egypt: Behold, I have sworn by my great  name, saith Jehovah, that my name shall no more be named in the  mouth of any man of Judah in all the land of Egypt, saying,  [As] the Lord Jehovah liveth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:27">44:27</a> Behold, I will watch over them for evil, and not for good;  and all the men of Judah that are in the land of Egypt shall be  consumed by the sword and by the famine, until there be an end  of them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:28">44:28</a> And they that escape the sword shall return out of the  land of Egypt into the land of Judah, a very small company; and  all the remnant of Judah, that have come into the land of Egypt  to sojourn there, shall know whose word shall stand, mine or  theirs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:29">44:29</a> And this shall be the sign unto you, saith Jehovah, that I  will punish you in this place, that ye may know that my words  shall certainly stand against you for evil:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_44:30">44:30</a> thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will give Pharaoh-Hophra  king of Egypt into the hand of his enemies, and into the hand  of them that seek his life; as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah  into the hand of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon, his enemy, and  that sought his life.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:1">45:1</a> The word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Baruch the son  of Nerijah, when he wrote these words in a book at the mouth of  Jeremiah, in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah,  the king of Judah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:2">45:2</a> Thus sayeth Jehovah, the God of Israel, concerning thee,  Baruch:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:3">45:3</a> Thou didst say, Woe unto me! for Jehovah hath added grief  to my sorrow; I am weary with my sighing, and I find no rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:4">45:4</a> Thus shalt thou say unto him, Thus saith Jehovah: Behold,  what I have built do I overthrow, and what I have planted I  pluck up, even this whole land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:5">45:5</a> And seekest thou great things for thyself? seek [them] not;  for behold, I will bring evil upon all flesh, saith Jehovah;  but thy life will I give unto thee for a prey in all places  whither thou shalt go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:1">46:1</a> The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet  concerning the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:2">46:2</a> Of Egypt: concerning the army of Pharaoh-Necho king of  Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish, which  Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon smote in the fourth year of  Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, the king of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:3">46:3</a> Make ready buckler and shield, and draw near to battle!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:4">46:4</a> Harness the horses, and mount ye horsemen, and stand forth  with helmets; polish the spears, put on the coats of mail!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:5">46:5</a> Why do I see them dismayed, turned away back? And their  mighty ones are beaten down, and take to flight, and look not  back? Terror [is] on every side, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:6">46:6</a> Let not the swift flee away, neither let the mighty man  escape! -- Toward the north, hard by the river Euphrates, they  have stumbled and fallen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:7">46:7</a> Who is this [that] riseth up as the Nile, whose waters toss  themselves like the rivers?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:8">46:8</a> It is Egypt that riseth up as the Nile, and [his] waters  toss themselves like the rivers; and he saith, I will rise up,  I will cover the earth; I will destroy the city and the  inhabitants thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:9">46:9</a> Go up, ye horses, and drive furiously, ye chariots; and let  the mighty men go forth: Cush and Phut that handle the shield,  and the Ludim that handle the bow [and] bend it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:10">46:10</a> For this is the day of the Lord Jehovah of hosts, a day of  vengeance, that he may be avenged of his adversaries; and the  sword shall devour, and it shall be sated and made drunk with  their blood; for the Lord Jehovah of hosts hath a sacrifice in  the north country, by the river Euphrates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:11">46:11</a> Go up to Gilead, and fetch balm, O virgin-daughter of  Egypt! In vain shalt thou multiply remedies: there is no  healing for thee.</p>

 <p><a name="an_46:13">46:13</a> The word that Jehovah spoke to Jeremiah the prophet,  concerning the coming of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon to  smite the land of Egypt:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:14">46:14</a> Declare in Egypt, and publish in Migdol, and publish in  Noph, and in Tahpanhes; say, Stand fast, and prepare thee; for  the sword devoureth round about thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:15">46:15</a> Why are thy valiants swept away? They stood not, for  Jehovah did thrust them down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:16">46:16</a> He made many to stumble, yea, one fell upon another; and  they said, Arise, and let us return to our own people and to  the land of our nativity, from the oppressing sword.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:17">46:17</a> There did they cry, Pharaoh king of Egypt is but a noise;  he hath let the time appointed go by.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:18">46:18</a> [As] I live, saith the King, whose name is Jehovah of  hosts, surely as Tabor among the mountains, and as Carmel by  the sea, so shall he come.</p>

 <p><a name="an_46:21">46:21</a> Also her hired men in the midst of her are like fatted  bullocks; for they also have turned back, they have fled away  together, they did not stand; for the day of their calamity is  come upon them, the time of their visitation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:22">46:22</a> Her voice shall go like a serpent's; for they shall march  with an army, and come against her with axes, as hewers of  wood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:23">46:23</a> They shall cut down her forest, saith Jehovah, though it  be impenetrable; for they are more than the locusts, and are  innumerable.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:24">46:24</a> The daughter of Egypt is put to shame; she is delivered  into the hand of the people of the north.</p>

 <p><a name="an_46:27">46:27</a> But thou, my servant Jacob, fear not, neither be dismayed,  Israel: for behold, I will save thee from afar, and thy seed  from the land of their captivity; and Jacob shall return, and  be in rest and at ease, and none shall make [him] afraid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_46:28">46:28</a> Fear thou not, my servant Jacob, saith Jehovah: for I am  with thee; for I will make a full end of all the nations  whither I have driven thee, but I will not make a full end of  thee; but I will correct thee with judgment, and I will not  hold thee altogether guiltless.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:1">47:1</a> The word of Jehovah that came to the prophet Jeremiah  concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh smote Gazah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:2">47:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, waters rise up out of the  north, and shall become an overflowing flood, and shall  overflow the land, and all that is therein; the city, and them  that dwell therein: and the men shall cry, and all the  inhabitants of the land shall howl,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:3">47:3</a> at the noise of the stamping of the hoofs of his steeds, at  the rushing of his chariots, at the rumbling of his wheels:  fathers shall not look back for [their] children, from  feebleness of hands;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:4">47:4</a> because of the day that cometh to lay waste all the  Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper that  remaineth; for Jehovah will lay waste the Philistines, the  remnant of the island of Caphtor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:5">47:5</a> Baldness is come upon Gazah; Ashkelon is cut off, the  remnant of their valley: how long wilt thou cut thyself?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:6">47:6</a> Alas! sword of Jehovah, how long wilt thou not be quiet?  Withdraw into thy scabbard, rest, and be still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:7">47:7</a> How shouldest thou be quiet? -- For Jehovah hath given it a  charge: against Ashkelon, and against the sea shore, there hath  he appointed it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:1">48:1</a> Concerning Moab. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of  Israel: Woe unto Nebo! for it is spoiled; Kirjathaim is put to  shame, it is taken; Misgab is put to shame and dismayed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:2">48:2</a> Moab's praise is no more; in Heshbon they have devised evil  against her: Come, and let us cut her off from [being] a  nation. Thou also, O Madmen, shalt be cut down; the sword shall  pursue thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:3">48:3</a> A voice of crying from Horonaim; wasting and great  destruction!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:4">48:4</a> Moab is destroyed; her little ones have caused a cry to be  heard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:5">48:5</a> For by the ascent of Luhith continual weeping shall go up;  for in the descent of Horonaim is heard the anguish of the cry  of destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:6">48:6</a> Flee, save your lives, and be like a shrub in the  wilderness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:7">48:7</a> For because thou hast confided in thy works and in thy  treasures, thou also shalt be taken, and Chemosh shall go forth  into captivity, his priests and his princes together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:8">48:8</a> And the waster shall come upon every city, that not a city  shall escape; and the valley shall perish, and the plateau  shall be destroyed: as Jehovah hath said.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:9">48:9</a> Give wings unto Moab, that she may flee and get away; and  the cities thereof shall become a desolation, without  inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:10">48:10</a> Cursed be he that doeth the work of Jehovah negligently,  and cursed be he that keepeth back his sword from blood!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:11">48:11</a> Moab hath been at ease from his youth, and hath settled on  his lees; he hath not been emptied from vessel to vessel,  neither hath he gone into captivity: therefore his taste hath  remained in him, and his scent is not changed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:12">48:12</a> Therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will  send unto him pourers that shall pour him off, and shall empty  his vessels, and break in pieces his flagons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:13">48:13</a> And Moab shall be ashamed of Chemosh, as the house of  Israel was ashamed of Bethel, their confidence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:14">48:14</a> How do ye say, We are mighty, and men of valour for the  war?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:15">48:15</a> Moab is laid waste, and his cities are gone up [in smoke],  and his chosen young men are gone down to the slaughter, saith  the King, whose name is Jehovah of hosts.</p>

 <p><a name="an_48:17">48:17</a> All ye that are about him, bemoan him; and all ye that  know his name, say, How is the strong staff broken, the  beautiful rod!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:18">48:18</a> Come down from [thy] glory and sit in the drought, O  inhabitress, daughter of Dibon; the spoiler of Moab is come up  against thee, thy strongholds hath he destroyed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:19">48:19</a> Stand by the way, and watch, inhabitress of Aroer; ask him  that fleeth, and her that escapeth; say, What is done?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:20">48:20</a> Moab is put to shame; for he is broken down: howl and cry;  tell it in Arnon, that Moab is laid waste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:21">48:21</a> And judgment is come upon the country of the plateau; upon  Holon, and upon Jahzah, and upon Mephaath;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:22">48:22</a> and upon Dibon, and upon Nebo, and upon Beth-diblathaim;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:23">48:23</a> and upon Kirjathaim, and upon Beth-gamul, and upon  Beth-meon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:24">48:24</a> and upon Kerijoth, and upon Bozrah, and upon all the  cities of the land of Moab, far and near.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:25">48:25</a> The horn of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken, saith  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:26">48:26</a> Make him drunken, for he magnified himself against  Jehovah; and Moab shall wallow in his vomit, and he also shall  be in derision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:27">48:27</a> For was not Israel a derision unto thee? Was he found  among thieves, that as oft as thou didst speak of him, thou  didst shake the head?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:28">48:28</a> Leave the cities, and dwell in the rocks, ye inhabitants  of Moab, and be like the dove, that maketh her nest in the  sides of the cave's mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:29">48:29</a> We have heard of the arrogance of Moab, -- [he is] very  proud; -- his loftiness, and his arrogance, and his pride, and  the haughtiness of his heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:30">48:30</a> I know his wrath, saith Jehovah; his pratings are vain:  they do not as [they say].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:31">48:31</a> Therefore will I howl for Moab, and I will cry out for all  Moab: for the men of Kir-heres shall there be moaning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:32">48:32</a> O vine of Sibmah, I will weep for thee with more than the  weeping of Jaazer: thy shoots passed over the sea, they reached  to the sea of Jaazer. The spoiler is fallen upon thy summer  fruits and upon thy vintage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:33">48:33</a> And joy and gladness is taken away from the fruitful field  and from the land of Moab; and I have caused wine to fail from  the winepresses: they shall no more tread with shouting; the  shouting shall be no shouting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:34">48:34</a> Because of the cry from Heshbon, unto Elaleh, unto Jahaz  have they uttered their voice, from Zoar unto Horonaim, [unto]  Eglath-shelishijah: for even the waters of Nimrim shall become  desolations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:35">48:35</a> And I will cause to cease in Moab, saith Jehovah, him that  offereth in the high place, and him that burneth incense to his  gods.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:36">48:36</a> Therefore my heart shall sound for Moab like pipes, and my  heart shall sound like pipes for the men of Kir-heres; because  the abundance that he hath gotten is perished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:37">48:37</a> For every head is bald, and every beard clipped; upon all  the hands are cuttings, and upon the loins sackcloth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:38">48:38</a> It is wholly lamentation upon all the housetops of Moab,  and in the public places thereof; for I have broken Moab, like  a vessel wherein is no pleasure, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:39">48:39</a> They howl, How is it broken down! how hath Moab turned the  back with shame! And Moab shall be a derision and a terror to  all that are round about him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:40">48:40</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, he shall fly as an eagle,  and shall spread forth his wings over Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:41">48:41</a> Kerijoth is taken, and the strongholds are seized, and at  that day the heart of the mighty men of Moab shall be as the  heart of a woman in her pangs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:42">48:42</a> And Moab shall be destroyed from being a people, because  he hath magnified himself against Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:43">48:43</a> Fear, and the pit, and the snare shall be upon thee, O  inhabitant of Moab, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:44">48:44</a> He that fleeth from the fear shall fall into the pit; and  he that getteth up out of the pit shall be taken in the snare:  for I will bring upon her, upon Moab, the year of their  visitation, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:45">48:45</a> They that fled stood under the shadow of Heshbon  powerless; for a fire hath come forth from Heshbon, and a flame  from the midst of Sihon, and hath consumed the corner of Moab,  and the crown of the head of the sons of tumult.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:46">48:46</a> Woe to thee, Moab! The people of Chemosh is undone; for  thy sons are taken away in captivity, and thy daughters are  captives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:47">48:47</a> But I will turn the captivity of Moab at the end of the  days, saith Jehovah. Thus far is the judgement of Moab.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:1">49:1</a> Concerning the children of Ammon. Thus saith Jehovah: Hath  Israel no sons? hath he no heir? Why is Malcam heir of Gad, and  his people dwell in the cities thereof?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:2">49:2</a> Therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will  cause the clamour of war to be heard in Rabbah of the children  of Ammon; and it shall be a desolate heap; and her towns shall  be burned with fire; and Israel shall possess them that  possessed him, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:3">49:3</a> Howl, Heshbon! for Ai is laid waste; cry, daughters of  Rabbah, gird you with sackcloth, lament and run to and fro  within the enclosures: for Malcam shall go into captivity, his  priests and his princes together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:4">49:4</a> Wherefore gloriest thou in the valleys? Thy valley shall  flow down, O backsliding daughter, that trusteth in her  treasures, [saying,] Who shall come against me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:5">49:5</a> Behold, I will bring a fear upon thee, saith the Lord  Jehovah of hosts, from all that are about thee; and ye shall be  driven out every man right forth; and none shall assemble the  fugitives.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:6">49:6</a> And afterwards I will turn the captivity of the children of  Ammon, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:7">49:7</a> Concerning Edom. Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Is there no  more wisdom in Teman? is counsel perished from the prudent? is  their wisdom spent?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:8">49:8</a> Flee, turn back, dwell deep down, ye inhabitants of Dedan!  For I will bring the calamity of Esau upon him, the time that I  visit him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:9">49:9</a> If grape-gatherers had come to thee, would they not have  left a gleaning? If thieves by night, they would destroy only  till they had enough.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:10">49:10</a> But I have made Esau bare, I have uncovered his secret  places, that he is unable to hide himself: his seed is wasted,  and his brethren, and his neighbours, and he is not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:11">49:11</a> Leave thine orphans, I will preserve them alive; and let  thy widows trust in me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:12">49:12</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, they whose judgment was  not to drink of the cup shall assuredly drink; and thou indeed,  shouldest thou be altogether unpunished? Thou shalt not go  unpunished, but thou shalt surely drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:13">49:13</a> For I have sworn by myself, saith Jehovah, that Bozrah  shall become an astonishment, a reproach, a waste, and a curse;  and all the cities thereof shall be perpetual wastes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:14">49:14</a> I have heard a rumour from Jehovah, and an ambassador is  sent among the nations: -- Gather yourselves together, and come  against her and rise up for the battle.</p>

 <p><a name="an_49:23">49:23</a> Concerning Damascus. Hamath is put to shame, and Arpad;  for they have heard evil tidings, they are melted away: there  is distress on the sea; it cannot be quiet.</p>

 <p><a name="an_49:33">49:33</a> And Hazor shall be a dwelling-place of jackals, a  desolation for ever. No one shall dwell there, neither shall a  son of man sojourn therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:34">49:34</a> The word of Jehovah that came to Jeremiah the prophet  concerning Elam, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king  of Judah, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_49:38">49:38</a> And I will set my throne in Elam, and will destroy from  thence king and princes, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:39">49:39</a> But it shall come to pass at the end of the days, I will  turn the captivity of Elam, saith Jehovah.</p>

 <p><a name="an_50:30">50:30</a> Therefore shall her young men fall in her streets; and all  her men of war shall be cut off in that day, saith Jehovah.</p>

 <p><a name="an_50:33">50:33</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The children of Israel and  the children of Judah were together oppressed; and all that  took them captives held them fast: they refused to let them go.</p>

 <p><a name="an_50:46">50:46</a> At the sound of the taking of Babylon the earth hath  quaked, and the cry is heard among the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:1">51:1</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will raise up against  Babylon, and against them that dwell in the heart of those that  rise against me, a destroying wind;</p>

 <p><a name="an_51:5">51:5</a> For Israel is not forsaken, nor Judah of his God, of  Jehovah of hosts; for their land is full of guilt against the  Holy One of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:6">51:6</a> Flee out of the midst of Babylon, and save every man his  life; be ye not cut off in her iniquity: for this is the time  of Jehovah's vengeance: he shall render unto her a recompence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:7">51:7</a> Babylon hath been a golden cup in Jehovah's hand, that made  all the earth drunken: the nations have drunk of her wine;  therefore have the nations become mad.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:8">51:8</a> Babylon is suddenly fallen and ruined. Howl over her; take  balm for her pain, if so be she may be healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:9">51:9</a> We have treated Babylon, but she is not healed: forsake  her, and let us go every one into his own country; for her  judgment reacheth unto the heavens, and is lifted up to the  skies.</p>

 <p><a name="an_51:11">51:11</a> Sharpen the arrows; take the shields. Jehovah hath stirred  up the spirit of the kings of the Medes; for his purpose is  against Babylon, to destroy it; for this is the vengeance of  Jehovah, the vengeance of his temple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:12">51:12</a> Lift up a banner towards the walls of Babylon, make the  watch strong, set the watchmen, prepare the ambushes; for  Jehovah hath both devised and done that which he spoke against  the inhabitants of Babylon.</p>

 <p><a name="an_51:51">51:51</a> -- We are put to shame, for we have heard reproach;  confusion hath covered our face: for strangers are come into  the sanctuaries of Jehovah's house.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:52">51:52</a> -- Therefore behold, days come, saith Jehovah, that I will  punish her graven images; and throughout her land the wounded  shall groan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:53">51:53</a> Though Babylon should mount up to the heavens, and though  she should fortify the height of her strength, yet from me  shall spoilers come unto her, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:54">51:54</a> The sound of a cry [cometh] from Babylon, and great  destruction from the land of the Chaldeans;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:55">51:55</a> for Jehovah spoileth Babylon, and he will destroy out of  her the great voice; and their waves roar like great waters,  the noise of their voice resoundeth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:56">51:56</a> For the spoiler is come against her, against Babylon, and  her mighty men are taken; their bows are broken in pieces; for  Jehovah, the ùGod of recompences, will certainly requite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:57">51:57</a> And I will make drunk her princes, and her wise men, her  governors, and her rulers, and her mighty men; and they shall  sleep a perpetual sleep, and not wake, saith the King, whose  name is Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:58">51:58</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The broad walls of Babylon  shall be utterly laid bare, and her high gates shall be burned  with fire; so that the peoples will have laboured in vain, and  the nations for the fire: and they shall be weary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:59">51:59</a> The word that Jeremiah the prophet commanded Seraiah the  son of Nerijah, the son of Mahseiah, when he went with Zedekiah  the king of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign.  Now Seraiah was chief chamberlain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:60">51:60</a> And Jeremiah wrote in a book all the evil that should come  upon Babylon, all these words that are written against Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:61">51:61</a> And Jeremiah said to Seraiah, When thou comest to Babylon,  see that thou read all these words;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:62">51:62</a> and say, Jehovah, thou hast spoken concerning this place,  that thou wilt cut it off, so that none shall dwell in it,  neither man nor beast, but that it shall be desolate for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:63">51:63</a> And it shall be, when thou hast ended reading this book,  [that] thou shalt bind a stone to it, and cast it into the  midst of the Euphrates;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:64">51:64</a> and shalt say, Thus shall Babylon sink, and shall not  rise, because of the evil that I will bring upon it: and they  shall be weary. Thus far the words of Jeremiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:1">52:1</a> Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he began to reign;  and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem; and his mother's name  was Hamutal, daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:2">52:2</a> And he did evil in the sight of Jehovah, according to all  that Jehoiakim had done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:3">52:3</a> For, because the anger of Jehovah was against Jerusalem and  Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, Zedekiah  rebelled against the king of Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:4">52:4</a> And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the  tenth month, on the tenth of the month, [that] Nebuchadrezzar  king of Babylon came, he and all his army, against Jerusalem;  and they encamped against it, and built turrets against it  round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:5">52:5</a> And the city was besieged until the eleventh year of king  Zedekiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:6">52:6</a> In the fourth month, on the ninth of the month, the famine  prevailed in the city, and there was no bread for the people of  the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:7">52:7</a> And the city was broken into: and all the men of war fled,  and went forth out of the city by night, by the way of the gate  between the two walls, which was by the king's garden (now the  Chaldeans were near the city round about); and they went the  way toward the plain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:8">52:8</a> And the army of the Chaldeans pursued after the king, and  overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho; and all his army  was scattered from him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:9">52:9</a> And they took the king, and brought him up to the king of  Babylon, unto Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he pronounced  judgment upon him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:10">52:10</a> And the king of Babylon slaughtered the sons of Zedekiah  before his eyes; and he slaughtered also all the princes of  Judah in Riblah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:11">52:11</a> And he put out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with  chains of brass; and the king of Babylon carried him to  Babylon, and put him in prison till the day of his death.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:12">52:12</a> And in the fifth month, on the tenth of the month, which  was in the nineteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar king of Babylon,  Nebuzar-adan, captain of the body-guard, who stood before the  king of Babylon, came unto Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:13">52:13</a> and he burned the house of Jehovah, and the king's house,  and all the houses of Jerusalem; and every great [man's] house  he burned with fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:14">52:14</a> And all the army of the Chaldeans, that were with the  captain of the body-guard, broke down all the walls of  Jerusalem round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:15">52:15</a> And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard carried  away captive of the poorest sort of the people, and the rest of  the people that were left in the city, and the deserters that  had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the  multitude.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:16">52:16</a> But Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard left of the  poor of the land for vinedressers and for husbandmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:17">52:17</a> And the brazen pillars that were in the house of Jehovah,  and the bases, and the brazen sea that was in the house of  Jehovah, the Chaldeans broke up, and carried all the brass  thereof to Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:18">52:18</a> The pots also, and the shovels, and the knives, and the  bowls, and the cups, and all the vessels of brass wherewith  they ministered, they took away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:19">52:19</a> And the basons and the censers, and the bowls, and the  pots, and the candlesticks, and the cups, and the goblets, that  which was of gold in gold, and that which was of silver in  silver, the captain of the body-guard took away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:20">52:20</a> The two pillars, the one sea, and the twelve brazen oxen  that formed the bases, which king Solomon had made for the  house of Jehovah: for the brass of all these vessels there was  no weight.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:21">52:21</a> And as to the pillars: the height of one pillar was  eighteen cubits, and a line of twelve cubits encompassed it;  and the thickness thereof was four fingers: it was hollow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:22">52:22</a> And the capital upon it was brass, and the height of the  one capital [was] five cubits; and the network and the  pomegranates, upon the capital round about, all of brass; and  similarly for the second pillar, and the pomegranates.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:23">52:23</a> And there were ninety-six pomegranates on the [four]  sides; all the pomegranates upon the network were a hundred  round about.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:24">52:24</a> And the captain of the body-guard took Seraiah the chief  priest, and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three  doorkeepers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:25">52:25</a> And out of the city he took a eunuch that was set over the  men of war, and seven men of them that were in the king's  presence, who were found in the city, and the scribe of the  captain of the host, who enrolled the people of the land. And  sixty men of the people of the land that were found in the  midst of the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:26">52:26</a> And Nebuzar-adan the captain of the body-guard took them,  and brought them to the king of Babylon to Riblah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:27">52:27</a> and the king of Babylon smote them, and put them to death  at Riblah in the land of Hamath. Thus Judah was carried away  captive out of his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:28">52:28</a> This is the people whom Nebuchadrezzar carried away  captive: in the seventh year three thousand and twenty-three  Jews;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:29">52:29</a> in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadrezzar [he carried away  captive] from Jerusalem eight hundred and thirty-two persons;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:30">52:30</a> in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadrezzar, Nebuzar-adan  the captain of the body-guard carried away captive of the Jews  seven hundred and forty-five persons: all the persons were four  thousand six hundred.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:31">52:31</a> And it came to pass in the thirty-seventh year of the  captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month, on  the twenty-fifth of the month, [that] Evil-Merodach king of  Babylon, in the year that he began to reign, lifted up the head  of Jehoiachin king of Judah, and brought him forth out of  prison;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:32">52:32</a> and he spoke kindly unto him, and set his seat above the  seat of the kings that were with him in Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:33">52:33</a> And he changed his prison garments; and he ate bread  before him continually all the days of his life;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:34">52:34</a> and his allowance was a continual allowance given him by  the king of Babylon, every day a portion until the day of his  death, all the days of his life.</p>
