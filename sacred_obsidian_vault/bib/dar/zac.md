  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Zechariah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the  word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the prophet, the son of  Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Jehovah hath been very wroth with your fathers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> And thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts:  Return unto me, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will return unto  you, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets  cried, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Turn ye now from  your evil ways, and from your evil doings; but they did not  hearken nor attend unto me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live  for ever?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants  the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? And they  turned and said, Like as Jehovah of hosts thought to do unto  us, according to our ways and according to our doings, so hath  he dealt with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which  is the month Shebat, in the second year of Darius, came the  word of Jehovah unto Zechariah the prophet, the son of  Berechiah, the son of Iddo, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> I saw by night, and behold, a man riding upon a red horse,  and he stood among the myrtle-trees that were in the low  valley; and behind him were red, bay, and white horses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> And I said, My lord, what are these? And the angel that  talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these are.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> And the man that stood among the myrtle-trees answered and  said, These are they whom Jehovah hath sent to walk to and fro  through the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> And they answered the angel of Jehovah that stood among the  myrtle-trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the  earth, and behold, all the earth sitteth still and is at rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> And the angel of Jehovah answered and said, Jehovah of  hosts, how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on  the cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation  these seventy years?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> And Jehovah answered the angel that talked with me good  words, comforting words.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> And the angel that talked with me said unto me, Cry,  saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Jerusalem  and for Zion with a great jealousy,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> and I am wroth exceedingly with the nations that are at  ease; for I was but a little wroth, and they helped forward the  affliction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah: I am returned to Jerusalem  with mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith Jehovah of  hosts, and the line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> Cry further, saying, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: My cities  shall yet overflow with prosperity, and Jehovah shall yet  comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What are  these? And he said to me, These are the horns which have  scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> And Jehovah shewed me four craftsmen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> And I said, What come these to do? And he spoke, saying,  Those are the horns which scattered Judah, so that no man  lifted up his head; but these are come to affright them, to  cast out the horns of the nations, which lifted up the horn  against the land of Judah to scatter it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold a man with a  measuring line in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And I said, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To  measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and what  is the length thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And behold, the angel that talked with me went forth; and  another angel went forth to meet him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> and said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,  Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the  multitude of men and cattle therein;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> and I, saith Jehovah, I will be unto her a wall of fire  round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> Ho, ho! flee from the land of the north, saith Jehovah; for  I have scattered you abroad as the four winds of the heavens,  saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> Ho! escape, Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of  Babylon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: After the glory, hath he  sent me unto the nations that made you a spoil; for he that  toucheth you toucheth the apple of his eye.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> For behold, I will shake my hand upon them, and they shall  become a spoil to those that served them: and ye shall know  that Jehovah of hosts hath sent me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Sing aloud and rejoice, daughter of Zion; for behold, I  come, and I will dwell in the midst of thee, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> And many nations shall join themselves to Jehovah in that  day, and shall be unto me for a people; and I will dwell in the  midst of thee, and thou shalt know that Jehovah of hosts hath  sent me unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> And Jehovah shall inherit Judah [as] his portion in the  holy land, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> Let all flesh be silent before Jehovah; for he is risen up  out of his holy habitation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the  Angel of Jehovah, and Satan standing at his right hand to  resist him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> And Jehovah said unto Satan, Jehovah rebuke thee, O Satan!  Yea, Jehovah that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee! Is not  this a brand plucked out of the fire?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> And Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood  before the Angel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And he spoke and said unto those that stood before him,  saying, Take away the filthy garments from off him. And unto  him he said, See, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from  thee, and I clothe thee with festival-robes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And I said, Let them set a pure turban upon his head. And  they set the pure turban upon his head, and clothed him with  garments; and the Angel of Jehovah stood by.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> And the Angel of Jehovah protested unto Joshua, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If thou wilt walk in my ways,  and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my  house, and shalt also keep my courts; and I will give thee a  place to walk among these that stand by.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> Hear now, Joshua the high priest, thou and thy fellows that  sit before thee -- for they are men of portent -- for behold, I  will bring forth my servant the Branch.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> For behold, the stone that I have laid before Joshua -- upon  one stone are seven eyes; behold, I will engrave the graving  thereof, saith Jehovah of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity  of this land in one day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall ye invite every  man his neighbour under the vine and under the fig-tree.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me,  as a man that is wakened out of his sleep.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I see, and  behold, a lamp-stand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of  it, and its seven lamps thereon, seven [lamps] and seven pipes  to the lamps, which are upon the top thereof;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> and two olive-trees beside it, one on the right of the bowl,  and the other on the left of it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> And I answered and spoke to the angel that talked with me,  saying, What are these, my lord?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me,  Knowest thou not what these are? And I said, No, my lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And he answered and spoke unto me, saying, This is the word  of Jehovah unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power,  but by my Spirit, saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:7">4:7</a> Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel [thou dost  become] a plain; and he shall bring forth the head-stone with  shoutings: Grace, grace unto it!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:8">4:8</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:9">4:9</a> The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this  house; and his hands shall finish it: and thou shalt know that  Jehovah of hosts hath sent me unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:10">4:10</a> For who hath despised the day of small things? Yea, they  shall rejoice [even] those seven -- and shall see the plummet  in the hand of Zerubbabel: these are the eyes of Jehovah, which  run to and fro in the whole earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:11">4:11</a> And I answered and said unto him, What are these two  olive-trees on the right of the lamp-stand and on its left?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:12">4:12</a> And I answered the second time and said unto him, What are  the two olive-branches which are beside the two golden tubes  that empty the gold out of themselves?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:13">4:13</a> And he spoke to me, saying, Knowest thou not what these  are? And I said, No, my lord.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:14">4:14</a> And he said, These are the two sons of oil, that stand  before the Lord of the whole earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> And I lifted up mine eyes again, and saw, and behold, a  flying roll.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I see a  flying roll: the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the  breadth thereof ten cubits.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And he said unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over  the face of the whole land: for every one that stealeth shall  be cut off according to it on this side; and every one that  sweareth shall be cut off according to it on that side.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> I will cause it to go forth, saith Jehovah of hosts, and it  shall enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of  him that sweareth falsely by my name; and it shall lodge in the  midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber  thereof and the stones thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto  me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth  forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> And I said, What is it? And he said, This is the ephah that  goeth forth. And he said, This is their resemblance in all the  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> And behold, there was lifted up a round plate of lead; and  this is a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> And he said, This is Wickedness: and he cast her into the  midst of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the  mouth thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> And I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and behold, there came  out two women, and the wind was in their wings; and they had  wings like the wings of a stork; and they lifted up the ephah  between the earth and the heavens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> And I said to the angel that talked with me, Whither do  these carry the ephah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> And he said unto me, To build it a house in the land of  Shinar; and it shall be established, and set there upon its own  base.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> And I lifted up mine eyes again, and saw, and behold, there  came four chariots out from between two mountains; and the  mountains were mountains of brass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second  chariot black horses;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> and in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth  chariot grisled, strong horses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And I spoke and said unto the angel that talked with me,  What are these, my lord?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four  spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before the  Lord of all the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> That in which are the black horses goeth forth into the  north country; and the white go forth after them; and the  grisled go forth towards the south country;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> and the strong go forth, and seek to go that they may walk  to and fro through the earth. And he said, Go, walk to and fro  through the earth. And they walked to and fro through the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And he cried unto me, and spoke unto me, saying, See, these  that go forth towards the north country have quieted my spirit  in the north country.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> Take [gifts] of them of the captivity, of Heldai, of  Tobijah, and of Jedaiah, and come thou the same day, and enter  into the house of Josiah the son of Zephaniah, whither they are  come from Babylon;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> yea, take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set [them]  upon the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak, the high priest;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> and speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts,  saying, Behold a man whose name is [the] Branch; and he shall  grow up from his own place, and he shall build the temple of  Jehovah:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> even he shall build the temple of Jehovah; and he shall  bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he  shall be a priest upon his throne; and the counsel of peace  shall be between them both.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:14">6:14</a> And the crowns shall be for Helem, and for Tobijah, and for  Jedaiah, and for Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in  the temple of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:15">6:15</a> And they that are far off shall come and build at the  temple of Jehovah: and ye shall know that Jehovah of hosts hath  sent me unto you. And [this] shall come to pass, if ye will  diligently hearken to the voice of Jehovah your God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that  the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah on the fourth [day] of  the ninth month, [even] in Chislev,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> when Bethel had sent Sherezer and Regem-melech, and his men,  to supplicate Jehovah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> [and] to speak unto the priests that were in the house of  Jehovah of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in  the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done now so many  years?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,  saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and in the  seventh [month], even those seventy years, did ye really fast  unto me, [even] unto me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> And when ye ate, and when ye drank, was it not you that were  eating and drinking?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> Are not these the words that Jehovah cried by the former  prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and at peace, and her  cities round about her, when the south and the lowland were  inhabited?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> And the word of Jehovah came unto Zechariah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> Thus speaketh Jehovah of hosts, saying, Execute true  judgment, and shew loving-kindness and mercies one to another,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> and oppress not the widow and the fatherless, the stranger  and the afflicted; and let none of you imagine evil against his  brother in your heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> But they refused to hearken, and turned a rebellious  shoulder, and made their ears heavy, that they should not hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And they made their heart [as] an adamant, that they should  not hear the law, and the words that Jehovah of hosts sent by  his Spirit by the hand of the former prophets: therefore was  there great wrath from Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And it came to pass, like as he called, and they would not  hear, so they called, and I would not hear, saith Jehovah of  hosts;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations  whom they knew not, and the land was desolate after them, so  that no one passed through nor returned; and they laid the  pleasant land desolate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And the word of Jehovah of hosts came [unto me], saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: I am jealous for Zion with  great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great fury.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> Thus saith Jehovah: I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell  in the midst of Jerusalem; and Jerusalem shall be called, The  city of truth; and the mountain of Jehovah of hosts, The holy  mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: There shall yet old men and old  women sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each one with his staff  in his hand for multitude of days.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls  playing in the streets thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: If it be wonderful in the eyes  of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be  wonderful in mine eyes? saith Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Behold, I will save my people  from the east country and from the west country;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> and I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of  Jerusalem; and they shall be my people, and I will be their  God, in truth and in righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Let your hands be strong, ye  that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the  prophets, that were in the day that the foundation of the house  of Jehovah of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> For before those days there was no hire for man, nor any  hire for beast; and there was no peace for him that went out or  that came in, because of the distress: for I let loose all men,  every one against his neighbour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> But now I will not be unto the remnant of this people as in  the former days, saith Jehovah of hosts;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> for the seed shall be prosperous, the vine shall give its  fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens  shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this  people to possess all these [things].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> And it shall come to pass, like as ye were a curse among  the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I  save you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear ye not, let your  hands be strong.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> For thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Like as I thought to do  you evil when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith Jehovah  of hosts, and I repented not;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> so again have I thought in these days to do good unto  Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> These are the things that ye shall do: Speak truth every  one with his neighbour; execute truth and the judgment of peace  in your gates;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> and let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his  neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are [things]  that I hate, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> And the word of Jehovah of hosts came unto me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: The fast of the fourth [month]  and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and the  fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and  gladness, and cheerful gatherings. Love ye then truth and  peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: Yet again shall there come  peoples, and the inhabitants of many cities;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> and the inhabitants of one city shall go to another,  saying, Let us go speedily to supplicate Jehovah, and to seek  Jehovah of hosts: I will go also.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> And many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek  Jehovah of hosts in Jerusalem, and to supplicate Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:23">8:23</a> Thus saith Jehovah of hosts: In those days shall ten men  take hold, out of all languages of the nations, shall even take  hold of the skirt of him that is a Jew, saying, We will go with  you; for we have heard [that] God is with you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> The burden of the word of Jehovah, in the land of Hadrach,  and [on] Damascus shall it rest; (for Jehovah hath an eye upon  men, and upon all the tribes of Israel;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> and also [on] Hamath [which] bordereth thereon; on Tyre and  Zidon, though she be very wise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> And Tyre hath built herself a stronghold, and hath heaped up  silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> Behold, the Lord will take possession of her, and he will  smite her power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with  fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> Ashkelon shall see [it], and fear; Gazah also, and she shall  be greatly pained; Ekron also, for her expectation shall be put  to shame: and the king shall perish from Gazah, and Ashkelon  shall not be inhabited.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the  pride of the Philistines;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> and I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his  abominations from between his teeth; but he that remaineth, he  also shall belong to our God, and shall be as a leader in  Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> And I will encamp about my house because of the army,  because of those that pass by and that return; and the exactor  shall not pass through them any more: for now have I seen [it]  with mine eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; shout, daughter of  Jerusalem! Behold, thy King cometh to thee: he is just, and  having salvation; lowly and rIding upon an ass, even upon a  colt the foal of an ass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse  from Jerusalem; and the battle-bow shall be cut off. And he  shall speak peace unto the nations; and his dominion shall be  from sea to sea, and from the river to the ends of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant, I will send  forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> Turn again to the stronghold, prisoners of hope! even  to-day do I declare I will render double unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> For I have bent Judah for me, I have filled the bow with  Ephraim; and I will raise up thy sons, O Zion, against thy  sons, O Greece, and make thee like the sword of a mighty man.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And Jehovah shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go  forth as the lightning; and the Lord Jehovah will blow the  trumpet, and will march with whirlwinds of the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> Jehovah of hosts will defend them; and they shall devour,  and shall tread down the sling-stones; and they shall drink,  [and] make a noise as from wine; and they shall be filled like  a bowl, like the corners of the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> And Jehovah their God shall save them in that day as the  flock of his people; for [they shall be as] the stones of a  crown, lifted up upon his land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!  Corn shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the  maidens.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Ask of Jehovah rain in the time of the latter rain; Jehovah  will make lightnings, and he will give them showers of rain, to  every one grass in the field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> For the teraphim have spoken vanity, and the diviners have  seen a lie, and have told false dreams: they comfort in vain.  Therefore they have gone away as a flock, they are in distress,  because there is no shepherd.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> Mine anger is kindled against the shepherds, and I will  punish the he-goats; for Jehovah of hosts visiteth his flock,  the house of Judah, and maketh them as his majestic horse in  the battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> From him shall come forth the corner-stone, from him the  nail, from him the battle bow, from him every exactor together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> And they shall be as mighty men, treading down the mire of  the streets in the battle; and they shall fight, for Jehovah is  with them, and the riders on horses shall be put to shame.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save  the house of Joseph, and I will bring them back again; for I  will have mercy upon them; and they shall be as though I had  not cast them off: for I am Jehovah their God, and I will  answer them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> And [they of] Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their  hearts shall rejoice as through wine; and their children shall  see [it], and rejoice; their heart shall be joyful in Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed  them: and they shall multiply as they used to multiply.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> And I will sow them among the peoples, and they shall  remember me in far countries; and they shall live with their  children and return.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> And I will bring them again out of the land of Egypt, and  gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the land  of Gilead and Lebanon; and [place] shall not be found for them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> And he shall pass through the sea of affliction, and shall  smite the billows in the sea, and all the depths of the Nile  shall dry up; and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down,  and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And I will strengthen them in Jehovah; and they shall walk  in his name, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:1">11:1</a> Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy  cedars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:2">11:2</a> Howl, cypress, for the cedar is fallen; because the noble  ones are spoiled. Howl, ye oaks of Bashan; for the strong  forest is come down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> A voice of howling of the shepherds; for their glory is  spoiled: a voice of roaring of young lions; for the pride of  Jordan is spoiled.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> Thus saith Jehovah my God: Feed the flock of slaughter,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> whose possessors slay them without being held guilty; and  they that sell them say, Blessed be Jehovah! for I am become  rich; and their own shepherds pity them not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith  Jehovah, and behold, I will deliver men, every one into his  neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king; and they shall  smite the land, and I will not deliver out of their hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:7">11:7</a> So I fed the flock of slaughter, truly the poor of the  flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called Beauty,  and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:8">11:8</a> And I destroyed three shepherds in one month; and my soul  was vexed with them, and their soul also loathed me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:9">11:9</a> And I said, I will not feed you: that which dieth, let it  die; and that which perisheth let it perish; and let them which  are left eat every one the flesh of another.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:10">11:10</a> And I took my staff, Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I  might break my covenant which I had made with all the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:11">11:11</a> And it was broken in that day; and so the poor of the  flock that gave heed to me knew that it was the word of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And I said unto them, If ye think good, give [me] my hire;  and if not, forbear. And they weighed for my hire thirty  silver-pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:13">11:13</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a  goodly price that I was prized at by them. And I took the  thirty silver-pieces, and cast them to the potter in the house  of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:14">11:14</a> And I cut asunder mine other staff, Bands, to break the  brotherhood between Judah and Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:15">11:15</a> And Jehovah said unto me, Take unto thee yet the  instruments of a foolish shepherd.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:16">11:16</a> For behold, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, who  shall not visit those that are about to perish, neither shall  seek that which is strayed away, nor heal that which is  wounded, nor feed that which is sound; but he will eat the  flesh of the fat, and tear their hoofs in pieces.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:17">11:17</a> Woe to the worthless shepherd that leaveth the flock! The  sword shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye; his arm  shall be clean dried up, and his right eye utterly darkened.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:1">12:1</a> The burden of the word of Jehovah concerning Israel. [Thus]  saith Jehovah, who stretcheth out the heavens, and layeth the  foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within  him:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:2">12:2</a> Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of bewilderment unto  all the peoples round about, and also against Judah shall it be  in the siege against Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:3">12:3</a> And it shall come to pass in that day [that] I will make  Jerusalem a burdensome stone unto all peoples: all that burden  themselves with it shall certainly be wounded, and all the  nations of the earth shall be assembled together against it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:4">12:4</a> In that day, saith Jehovah, I will smite every horse with  astonishment, and his rider with madness; but I will open mine  eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of the  peoples with blindness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:5">12:5</a> And the leaders of Judah shall say in their heart, The  inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength through Jehovah  of hosts their God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:6">12:6</a> In that day will I make the leaders of Judah like a hearth  of fire among wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf; and  they shall devour all the peoples round about, on the right  hand and on the left; and Jerusalem shall dwell again in her  own place, in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:7">12:7</a> And Jehovah shall save the tents of Judah first, that the  glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of  Jerusalem be not magnified over Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:8">12:8</a> In that day will Jehovah defend the inhabitants of  Jerusalem; and he that stumbleth among them at that day shall  be as David; and the house of David as God, as the Angel of  Jehovah before them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:9">12:9</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] I will seek  to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:10">12:10</a> And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the  inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of grace and of  supplications; and they shall look on me whom they pierced, and  they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for an only [son],  and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in  bitterness for [his] firstborn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:11">12:11</a> In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem,  as the mourning of Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:12">12:12</a> And the land shall mourn, every family apart: the family  of the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family  of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:13">12:13</a> the family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives  apart; the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_12:14">12:14</a> all the families that remain, every family apart, and  their wives apart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:1">13:1</a> In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house  of David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for  uncleanness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:2">13:2</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, saith Jehovah of  hosts, [that] I will cut off the names of the idols out of the  land, and they shall no more be remembered; and also I will  cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the  land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:3">13:3</a> And it shall come to pass, if any shall yet prophesy, that  his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto him,  Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name of  Jehovah; and his father and his mother that begat him shall  thrust him through when he prophesieth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:4">13:4</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the prophets  shall be ashamed every one of his vision, when he prophesieth;  neither shall they wear a hairy mantle to deceive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:5">13:5</a> And he shall say, I am no prophet, I am a tiller of the  ground; for man acquired me [as bondman] from my youth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:6">13:6</a> And one shall say unto him, What are those wounds in thy  hands? And he will say, Those with which I was wounded in the  house of my friends.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:7">13:7</a> Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, even against the man  [that is] my fellow, saith Jehovah of hosts: smite the  shepherd, and the sheep shall be scattered, and I will turn my  hand upon the little ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:8">13:8</a> And it shall come to pass in all the land, saith Jehovah,  two parts therein shall be cut off [and] die; but the third  shall be left therein.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_13:9">13:9</a> And I will bring the third part into the fire, and will  refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is  tried. They shall call on my name, and I will answer them: I  will say, It is my people; and they shall say, Jehovah is my  God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:1">14:1</a> Behold, the day cometh for Jehovah, and thy spoil shall be  divided in the midst of thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:2">14:2</a> And I will assemble all the nations against Jerusalem to  battle; and the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and  the women ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into  captivity; and the rest of the people shall not be cut off from  the city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:3">14:3</a> And Jehovah will go forth and fight with those nations, as  when he fought in the day of battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:4">14:4</a> And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of  Olives, which is before Jerusalem toward the east, and the  mount of Olives shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the  east and toward the west, -- a very great valley; and half of  the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it  toward the south.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:5">14:5</a> And ye shall flee [by] the valley of my mountains; for the  valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: ye shall even  flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days of  Uzziah king of Judah. And Jehovah my God shall come, [and] all  the holy ones with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:6">14:6</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] there shall  not be light; the shining shall be obscured.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:7">14:7</a> And it shall be one day which is known to Jehovah, not day,  and not night; and it shall come to pass, at eventide it shall  be light.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:8">14:8</a> And it shall come to pass in that day [that] living waters  shall go out from Jerusalem; half of them toward the eastern  sea, and half of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in  winter shall it be.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:9">14:9</a> And Jehovah shall be king over all the earth: in that day  shall there be one Jehovah, and his name one.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:10">14:10</a> All the land from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem shall  be turned as the Arabah; and [Jerusalem] shall be lifted up,  and shall dwell in her own place, from Benjamin's gate unto the  place of the first gate, unto the corner-gate, and from the  tower of Hananeel unto the king's winepresses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:11">14:11</a> And [men] shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more  utter destruction; and Jerusalem shall dwell safely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:12">14:12</a> And this shall be the plague wherewith Jehovah will smite  all the peoples that have warred against Jerusalem: their flesh  shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their  eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall  consume away in their mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:13">14:13</a> And it shall come to pass in that day [that] a great panic  from Jehovah shall be among them; and they shall lay hold every  one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall rise up  against the hand of his neighbour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:14">14:14</a> And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of  all the nations round about shall be gathered together -- gold,  and silver, and garments, in great abundance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:15">14:15</a> And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of  the camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be  in those camps, as this plague.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:16">14:16</a> And it shall come to pass, that all that are left of all  the nations which came against Jerusalem shall go up from year  to year to worship the King, Jehovah of hosts, and to celebrate  the feast of tabernacles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:17">14:17</a> And it shall be, that whoso goeth not up of the families  of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, Jehovah of  hosts, upon them shall be no rain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:18">14:18</a> And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not,  neither [shall it be] upon them; [there] shall be the plague,  wherewith Jehovah will smite the nations that go not up to  celebrate the feast of tabernacles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:19">14:19</a> This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment  of all the nations that go not up to celebrate the feast of  tabernacles.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:20">14:20</a> In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,  HOLINESS UNTO JEHOVAH; and the pots in Jehovah's house shall be  like the bowls before the altar.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_14:21">14:21</a> And every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness  unto Jehovah of hosts; and all they that sacrifice shall come  and take of them, and seethe therein. And in that day there  shall be no more a Canaanite in the house of Jehovah of hosts.</p>
