  <h3 align="center">Darby Bible: Isaiah</h3> 
 <p><a name="an_1:1">1:1</a> The vision of Isaiah the son of Amos, which he saw  concerning Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham,  Ahaz, Hezekiah, kings of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:2">1:2</a> Hear, [ye] heavens, and give ear, [thou] earth! for Jehovah  hath spoken: I have nourished and brought up children; and they  have rebelled against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:3">1:3</a> The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib;  Israel doth not know, my people hath no intelligence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:4">1:4</a> Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of  evildoers, children that corrupt themselves! They have forsaken  Jehovah; they have despised the Holy One of Israel; they are  turned away backward.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:5">1:5</a> Why should ye be smitten any more? ye will revolt more and  more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:6">1:6</a> From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no  soundness in him; wounds, and weals, and open sores: they have  not been dressed, nor bound up, nor mollified with oil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:7">1:7</a> Your country is desolate; your cities are burned with fire;  your land, strangers eat it up in your presence, and it is  desolate, as overthrown by strangers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:8">1:8</a> And the daughter of Zion is left, as a booth in a vineyard,  as a night-lodge in a cucumber-garden, as a besieged city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:9">1:9</a> Unless Jehovah of hosts had left us a very small residue, we  should have been as Sodom, we should have been like unto  Gomorrah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:10">1:10</a> Hear the word of Jehovah, rulers of Sodom; give ear unto  the law of our God, people of Gomorrah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:11">1:11</a> To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto  me? saith Jehovah. I am sated with burnt-offerings of rams, and  the fat of fed beasts; and in the blood of bullocks, and of  lambs, and of he-goats I take no pleasure.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:12">1:12</a> When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this  from your hand -- to tread my courts?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:13">1:13</a> Bring no more vain oblations! Incense is an abomination  unto me, -- new moon and sabbath, the calling of convocations  -- wickedness and the solemn meeting I cannot bear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:14">1:14</a> Your new moons and your set feasts my soul hateth: they are  a burden to me; I am wearied of bearing [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:15">1:15</a> And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes  from you; yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear: your  hands are full of blood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:16">1:16</a> Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings  from before mine eyes; -- cease to do evil,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:17">1:17</a> learn to do well: seek judgment, gladden the oppressed, do  justice to the fatherless, plead for the widow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:18">1:18</a> Come now, let us reason together, saith Jehovah: though  your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow; though  they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:19">1:19</a> If ye be willing and hearken, ye shall eat the good of the  land;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:20">1:20</a> but if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the  sword: for the mouth of Jehovah hath spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:21">1:21</a> How is the faithful city become a harlot! It was full of  judgment; righteousness used to lodge in it, but now murderers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:22">1:22</a> Thy silver is become dross, thy wine is mixed with water:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:23">1:23</a> thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves;  every one loveth presents, and hunteth after rewards; they  judge not the fatherless, and the cause of the widow cometh not  unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:24">1:24</a> Therefore saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, the Mighty One  of Israel: Ah! I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge  me of mine enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:25">1:25</a> And I will turn my hand upon thee, and will thoroughly  purge away thy dross, and take away all thine alloy;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:26">1:26</a> and I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy  counsellors as at the beginning. Afterwards thou shalt be  called, Town of righteousness, Faithful city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:27">1:27</a> Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and they that return  of her with righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:28">1:28</a> But the ruin of the transgressors and of the sinners [shall  be] together; and they that forsake Jehovah shall be consumed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:29">1:29</a> For they shall be ashamed of the terebinths that ye have  desired, and ye shall blush for the gardens that ye have  chosen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:30">1:30</a> For ye shall be as a terebinth whose leaf fadeth, and as a  garden that hath no water.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_1:31">1:31</a> And the strong shall be for tow, and his work a spark; and  they shall both burn together, and there shall be none to  quench [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:1">2:1</a> The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah  and Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:2">2:2</a> And it shall come to pass in the end of days, [that] the  mountain of Jehovah's house shall be established on the top of  the mountains, and shall be lifted up above the hills; and all  the nations shall flow unto it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:3">2:3</a> And many peoples shall go and say, Come, and let us go up to  the mountain of Jehovah, to the house of the God of Jacob; and  he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths.  For out of Zion shall go forth the law, and Jehovah's word from  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:4">2:4</a> And he shall judge among the nations, and shall reprove many  peoples; and they shall forge their swords into ploughshares,  and their spears into pruning-knives: nation shall not lift up  sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:5">2:5</a> House of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:6">2:6</a> For thou hast cast off thy people, the house of Jacob,  because they are filled [with what comes] from the east, and  use auguries like the Philistines, and ally themselves with the  children of foreigners.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:7">2:7</a> And their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no  end of their treasures: their land also is full of horses, and  there is no end of their chariots.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:8">2:8</a> And their land is full of idols; they bow themselves down to  the work of their own hands, to that which their fingers have  made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:9">2:9</a> And the mean man shall be bowed down, and the great man  shall be brought low: and do not thou forgive them!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:10">2:10</a> Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, from before  the terror of Jehovah, and from the glory of his majesty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:11">2:11</a> The lofty eyes of man shall be brought low, and the  haughtiness of men shall be bowed down, and Jehovah alone shall  be exalted in that day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:12">2:12</a> For there shall be a day of Jehovah of hosts upon  everything proud and lofty, and upon everything lifted up, and  it shall be brought low;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:13">2:13</a> and upon all the cedars of Lebanon, high and lifted up, and  upon all the oaks of Bashan;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:14">2:14</a> and upon all the lofty mountains, and upon all the hills  that are lifted up;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:15">2:15</a> and upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:16">2:16</a> and upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant  works of art.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:17">2:17</a> And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the  haughtiness of men shall be brought low; and Jehovah alone  shall be exalted in that day:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:18">2:18</a> and the idols shall utterly pass away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:19">2:19</a> And they shall go into the caves of the rocks, and into the  holes of the earth, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from  the glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to terrify the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:20">2:20</a> In that day men shall cast away their idols of silver and  their idols of gold, which they made [each] for himself to  worship, to the moles and to the bats;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:21">2:21</a> to go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the fissures  of the cliffs, from before the terror of Jehovah, and from the  glory of his majesty, when he shall arise to terrify the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_2:22">2:22</a> Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils; for  what account is to be made of him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:1">3:1</a> For behold, the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, will take away from  Jerusalem and from Judah stay and staff, the whole stay of  bread, and the whole stay of water,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:2">3:2</a> the mighty man and the man of war, the judge and the  prophet, and the diviner and the elder,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:3">3:3</a> the captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the  counsellor, and the clever among artificers, and the one versed  in enchantments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:4">3:4</a> And I will appoint youths as their princes, and children  shall rule over them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:5">3:5</a> And the people shall be oppressed one by the other, and each  by his neighbour; the child will be insolent against the elder,  and the base against the honourable.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:6">3:6</a> When a man shall take hold of his brother, in his father's  house, [and shall say:] Thou hast clothing; be our chief, and  let this ruin be under thy hand;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:7">3:7</a> he will lift up [his hand] in that day, saying, I cannot be  a healer, and in my house there is neither bread nor clothing;  ye shall not make me a chief of the people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:8">3:8</a> For Jerusalem stumbleth and Judah falleth, because their  tongue and their doings are against Jehovah, to provoke the  eyes of his glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:9">3:9</a> The look of their face doth witness against them, and they  declare their sin as Sodom: they hide it not. Woe unto their  soul! for they have brought evil upon themselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:10">3:10</a> Say ye of the righteous that it shall be well [with him],  for they shall eat the fruit of their doings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:11">3:11</a> Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill [with him], because  the desert of his hands shall be rendered unto him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:12">3:12</a> [As for] my people, children are their oppressors, and  women rule over them. My people! they that guide thee mislead  [thee], and destroy the way of thy paths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:13">3:13</a> Jehovah setteth himself to plead, and standeth to judge the  peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:14">3:14</a> Jehovah will enter into judgment with the elders of his  people and their princes, [saying:] It is ye that have eaten up  the vineyard: the spoil of the poor is in your houses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:15">3:15</a> What mean ye that ye crush my people, and grind the faces  of the afflicted? saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:16">3:16</a> And Jehovah said, Because the daughters of Zion are  haughty, and walk with stretched-out neck and wanton eyes, and  go along mincing, and making a tinkling with their feet;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:17">3:17</a> therefore the Lord will make bald the crown of the head of  the daughters of Zion, and Jehovah will lay bare their secret  parts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:18">3:18</a> In that day the Lord will take away the ornament of  anklets, and the little suns and crescents,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:19">3:19</a> the pearl-drops, and the bracelets, and the veils,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:20">3:20</a> the head-dresses, and the stepping chains, and the girdles,  and the scent-boxes, and the amulets;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:21">3:21</a> the finger-rings, and the nose-rings;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:22">3:22</a> the festival-robes, and the tunics, and the mantles, and  the wallets;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:23">3:23</a> the mirrors, and the fine linen bodices, and the turbans,  and the flowing veils.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:24">3:24</a> And it shall come to pass, instead of perfume there shall  be rottenness; and instead of a girdle, a rope; and instead of  well-set hair, baldness; and instead of a robe of display, a  girding of sackcloth; brand instead of beauty.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:25">3:25</a> Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the  fight;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_3:26">3:26</a> and her gates shall lament and mourn; and, stripped, she  shall sit upon the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:1">4:1</a> And seven women shall take hold of one man in that day,  saying, Our own bread will we eat, and with our own garments  will we be clothed; only let us be called by thy name; -- take  away our reproach!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:2">4:2</a> In that day there shall be a sprout of Jehovah for beauty  and glory, and the fruit of the earth for excellency and for  ornament for those that are escaped of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:3">4:3</a> And it shall come to pass that he who remaineth in Zion, and  he that is left in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, -- every  one that is written among the living in Jerusalem;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:4">4:4</a> when the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the  daughters of Zion, and shall have scoured out the blood of  Jerusalem from its midst, by the spirit of judgment, and by the  spirit of burning.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:5">4:5</a> And Jehovah will create over every dwelling-place of mount  Zion, and over its convocations, a cloud by day and a smoke,  and the brightness of a flame of fire by night: for over all  the glory shall be a covering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_4:6">4:6</a> And there shall be a tabernacle for shade by day from the  heat, and for a shelter and for a covert from storm and from  rain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:1">5:1</a> I will sing to my well-beloved a song of my beloved touching  his vineyard: My well-beloved had a vineyard upon a fruitful  hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:2">5:2</a> And he dug it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and  planted it with the choicest vine; and he built a tower in the  midst of it, and also hewed out a winepress therein; and he  looked that it should bring forth grapes, but it brought forth  wild grapes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:3">5:3</a> And now, inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, I  pray you, between me and my vineyard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:4">5:4</a> What was there yet to do to my vineyard that I have not done  in it? Wherefore, when I looked that it should bring forth  grapes, brought it forth wild grapes? --</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:5">5:5</a> And now, let me tell you what I am about to do to my  vineyard: I will take away its hedge, and it shall be eaten up;  I will break down its wall, and it shall be trodden under foot;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:6">5:6</a> and I will make it a waste -- it shall not be pruned nor  cultivated, but there shall come up briars and thorns; and I  will command the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:7">5:7</a> For the vineyard of Jehovah of hosts is the house of Israel,  and the men of Judah the plant of his delight: and he looked  for justice, and behold, blood-shedding; for righteousness, and  behold, a cry.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:8">5:8</a> Woe unto them that add house to house, that join field to  field, until there is no more room, and that ye dwell  yourselves alone in the midst of the land!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:9">5:9</a> In mine ears Jehovah of hosts [hath said], Many houses shall  assuredly become a desolation, great and excellent ones,  without inhabitant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:10">5:10</a> Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and a  homer of seed shall yield an ephah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:11">5:11</a> Woe unto them that, rising early in the morning, run after  strong drink; that linger till twilight, [till] wine inflameth  them!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:12">5:12</a> And harp and lyre, tambour and flute, and wine are in their  banquets; but they regard not the work of Jehovah, nor do they  see the operation of his hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:13">5:13</a> Therefore my people are led away captive from lack of  knowledge, and their nobility die of famine, and their  multitude are parched with thirst.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:14">5:14</a> Therefore doth Sheol enlarge its desire, and open its mouth  without measure; and her splendour shall descend [into it], and  her multitude, and her tumult, and [all] that is joyful within  her.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:15">5:15</a> And the mean man shall be bowed down, and the great man  brought low, and the eyes of the lofty shall be brought low;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:16">5:16</a> and Jehovah of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and the  holy ùGod hallowed in righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:17">5:17</a> And the lambs shall feed as on their pasture, and the waste  places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:18">5:18</a> Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and  sin as with cart-ropes!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:19">5:19</a> who say, Let him hasten, let him speed his work, that we  may see [it]; and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel  draw nigh and come, that we may know it!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:20">5:20</a> Woe unto them who call evil good, and good evil; who put  darkness for light, and light for darkness; who put bitter for  sweet, and sweet for bitter!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:21">5:21</a> Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and  intelligent in their own esteem!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:22">5:22</a> Woe unto them that are mighty for drinking wine, and men  valiant to mix strong drink;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:23">5:23</a> who justify the wicked for a bribe, and turn away the  righteousness of the righteous from them!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:24">5:24</a> Therefore as a tongue of fire devoureth the stubble, and  dry grass sinketh down in the flame, their root shall be as  rottenness, and their blossom shall go up as dust; for they  have rejected the law of Jehovah of hosts, and despised the  word of the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:25">5:25</a> Therefore is the anger of Jehovah kindled against his  people, and he hath stretched out his hand against them and  hath smitten them; and the mountains trembled, and their  carcases are become as dung in the midst of the streets. For  all this his anger is not turned away, and his hand is  stretched out still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:26">5:26</a> And he will lift up a banner to the nations afar off, and  will hiss for one from the end of the earth; and behold, it  will come rapidly [and] lightly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:27">5:27</a> None among them is weary, none stumbleth; they slumber not,  nor sleep; none hath the girdle of his loins loosed, nor the  thong of his sandals broken;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:28">5:28</a> their arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent; their  horses' hoofs are reckoned as the flint, and their wheels as a  whirlwind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:29">5:29</a> Their roaring is like a lioness, they roar as the young  lions; yea, they growl, and snatch the prey, and carry it away  safe, and there is none to deliver;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_5:30">5:30</a> and they shall roar against them in that day like the  roaring of the sea. And if one look upon the earth, behold  darkness [and] distress, and the light is darkened in the  heavens thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:1">6:1</a> In the year of the death of king Uzziah, I saw the Lord  sitting upon a throne, high and lifted up; and his train filled  the temple.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:2">6:2</a> Seraphim were standing above him: each had six wings; with  twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,  and with twain he flew.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:3">6:3</a> And one called to the other and said, Holy, holy, holy is  Jehovah of hosts; the whole earth is full of his glory!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:4">6:4</a> And the foundations of the thresholds shook at the voice of  him that cried, and the house was filled with smoke.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:5">6:5</a> And I said, Woe unto me! for I am undone; for I am a man of  unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean  lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:6">6:6</a> And one of the seraphim flew unto me, and he had in his hand  a glowing coal, which he had taken with the tongs from off the  altar;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:7">6:7</a> and he made it touch my mouth, and said, Behold, this hath  touched thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin  expiated.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:8">6:8</a> And I heard the voice of the Lord saying, Whom shall I send,  and who will go for us? And I said, Here am I; send me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:9">6:9</a> And he said, Go; and thou shalt say unto this people,  Hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing ye  shall see and shall not perceive.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:10">6:10</a> Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears  heavy, and blind their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and  hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and be  converted, and healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:11">6:11</a> And I said, Lord, how long? And he said, Until the cities  be wasted, without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and  the land become an utter desolation,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:12">6:12</a> and Jehovah have removed men far away, and the solitude be  great in the midst of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_6:13">6:13</a> But a tenth part shall still be therein, and it shall  return and be eaten; as the terebinth and as the oak whose  trunk [remaineth] after the felling: the holy seed shall be the  trunk thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:1">7:1</a> And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz, the son of Jotham,  the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, [that] Rezin the king of  Syria, and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, came up  to Jerusalem to make war against it, but they were not able to  fight against it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:2">7:2</a> And it was told the house of David saying, Syria is allied  with Ephraim. Then his heart and the heart of his people shook,  as the trees of the forest are shaken with the wind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:3">7:3</a> And Jehovah said to Isaiah, Go out now to meet Ahaz, thou  and thy son Shear-jashub, at the end of the aqueduct of the  upper pool, on the highway of the fuller's field;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:4">7:4</a> and thou shalt say unto him, Take heed and be quiet; fear  not, and let not thy heart faint before these two ends of  smoking firebrands, because of the fierce anger of Rezin and  Syria, and of the son of Remaliah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:5">7:5</a> Inasmuch as Syria hath taken evil counsel against thee,  Ephraim [also] and the son of Remaliah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:6">7:6</a> Let us go up against Judah, and harass it, and make a breach  therein for us, and set up a king therein -- the son of Tabeal;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:7">7:7</a> thus saith the Lord Jehovah: It shall not stand, nor come to  pass;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:8">7:8</a> for the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus  is Rezin; and within sixty-five years shall Ephraim be broken,  so as to be no [more a] people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:9">7:9</a> and the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria  is Remaliah's son. If ye believe not, surely ye shall not be  established.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:10">7:10</a> And Jehovah spoke again to Ahaz, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:11">7:11</a> Ask for thee a sign from Jehovah thy God; ask for it in the  deep, or in the height above.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:12">7:12</a> And Ahaz said, I will not ask, and will not tempt Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:13">7:13</a> And he said, Hear then, house of David: Is it a small  matter for you to weary men, that ye weary also my God?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:14">7:14</a> Therefore will the Lord himself give you a sign: Behold,  the virgin shall conceive and shall bring forth a son, and call  his name Immanuel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:15">7:15</a> Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse  the evil, and to choose the good.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:16">7:16</a> For before the child knoweth to refuse the evil and to  choose the good, the land whose two kings thou fearest shall be  forsaken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:17">7:17</a> Jehovah will bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon  thy father's house, days which have not come since the day when  Ephraim turned away from Judah -- [even] the king of Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:18">7:18</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah will  hiss for the fly which is at the extremity of the streams of  Egypt, and for the bee which is in the land of Assyria;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:19">7:19</a> and they shall come and settle all of them in the desolate  valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and on all  thorn-bushes, and on all the pastures.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:20">7:20</a> In that day will the Lord, with a razor which is hired  beyond the river, with the king of Assyria, shave the head and  the hair of the feet, yea, the beard also will it take away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:21">7:21</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] a man shall  nourish a young cow and two sheep,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:22">7:22</a> and it shall come to pass, from the abundance of milk they  shall give, [that] he shall eat butter; for every one that  remaineth in the midst of the land shall eat butter and honey.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:23">7:23</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] every place,  where there were a thousand vines at a thousand silver pieces,  shall become briars and thorns:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:24">7:24</a> with arrows and with the bow shall they come thither, for  the whole land shall become briars and thorns.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_7:25">7:25</a> And all mountains that have been dug up with the hoe --  thither will they not come, from fear of briars and thorns; and  they shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the  treading of small cattle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:1">8:1</a> And Jehovah said to me, Take thee a great tablet, and write  thereon with a man's style, concerning Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:2">8:2</a> And I took unto me to witness, sure witnesses, Urijah the  priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:3">8:3</a> And I came near to the prophetess, and she conceived and  bore a son; and Jehovah said unto me, Call his name,  Maher-shalal-hash-baz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:4">8:4</a> For before the lad knoweth to cry, My father! and, My  mother! the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria shall  be taken away before the king of Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:5">8:5</a> And Jehovah spoke again to me, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:6">8:6</a> Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah  which flow softly, and rejoiceth in Rezin and in the son of  Remaliah,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:7">8:7</a> therefore behold, the Lord will bring up upon them the  waters of the river, strong and many, the king of Assyria and  all his glory; and he shall mount up over all his channels, and  go over all his banks:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:8">8:8</a> and he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow it and go  further, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching  out of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O  Immanuel!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:9">8:9</a> Rage, ye peoples, and be broken in pieces! And give ear, all  ye distant parts of the earth: Gird yourselves, and be broken  in pieces; gird yourselves, and be broken in pieces!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:10">8:10</a> Settle a plan, and it shall come to nought; speak a word,  and it shall not stand: for ùGod is with us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:11">8:11</a> For Jehovah spoke thus to me with a strong hand, and he  instructed me not to walk in the way of this people, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:12">8:12</a> Ye shall not say, Conspiracy, of everything of which this  people saith, Conspiracy; and fear ye not their fear, and be  not in dread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:13">8:13</a> Jehovah of hosts, him shall ye sanctify; and let him be  your fear, and let him be your dread.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:14">8:14</a> And he will be for a sanctuary; and for a stone of  stumbling, and for a rock of offence to both the houses of  Israel, for a gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:15">8:15</a> And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken,  and snared, and taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:16">8:16</a> Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:17">8:17</a> And I will wait for Jehovah, who hideth his face from the  house of Jacob; and I will look for him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:18">8:18</a> Behold, I and the children that Jehovah hath given me are  for signs and for wonders in Israel, from Jehovah of hosts, who  dwelleth in mount Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:19">8:19</a> And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto the  necromancers and unto the soothsayers, who chirp and who  mutter, [say,] Shall not a people seek unto their God? [Will  they go] for the living unto the dead?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:20">8:20</a> To the law and the testimony! If they speak not according  to this word, for them there is no daybreak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:21">8:21</a> And they shall pass through it, hard pressed and hungry;  and it shall come to pass when they are hungry, they will fret  themselves, and curse their king and their God, and will gaze  upward:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_8:22">8:22</a> and they will look to the earth; and behold, trouble and  darkness, gloom of anguish; and they shall be driven into thick  darkness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:1">9:1</a> Nevertheless the darkness shall not be as when the distress  was in the [land], at the time he at first lightly, and  afterwards heavily, visited the land of Zebulun and the land of  Naphtali, -- the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of  the nations:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:2">9:2</a> the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light;  they that dwelt in the land of the shadow of death, upon them  light hath shone.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:3">9:3</a> Thou hast multiplied the nation, hast increased its joy:  they joy before thee like to the joy in harvest; as [men]  rejoice when they divide the spoil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:4">9:4</a> For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden and the staff of  his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of  Midian.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:5">9:5</a> For every boot of him that is shod for the tumult, and the  garment rolled in blood, shall be for burning, fuel for fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:6">9:6</a> For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given; and the  government shall be upon his shoulder; and his name is called  Wonderful, Counsellor, Mighty ùGod, Father of Eternity, Prince  of Peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:7">9:7</a> Of the increase of his government and of peace there shall  be no end, upon the throne of David and over his kingdom, to  establish it, and to uphold it with judgment and with  righteousness, from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of  Jehovah of hosts will perform this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:8">9:8</a> The Lord sent a word unto Jacob, and it lighteth upon  Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:9">9:9</a> And all the people shall know [it], Ephraim and the  inhabitant of Samaria, that say in pride and stoutness of  heart,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:10">9:10</a> The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn  stones; the sycamore trees are cut down, but we will replace  them with cedars.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:11">9:11</a> And Jehovah will set up the adversaries of Rezin against  him, and arm his enemies,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:12">9:12</a> the Syrians on the east, and the Philistines on the west;  and they shall devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his  anger is not turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:13">9:13</a> But the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, and  they do not seek Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:14">9:14</a> And Jehovah will cut off from Israel head and tail,  palm-branch and rush, in one day:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:15">9:15</a> the ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet  that teacheth lies, he is the tail.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:16">9:16</a> For the guides of this people mislead [them]; and they that  are guided by them are swallowed up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:17">9:17</a> Therefore the Lord will not rejoice in their young men,  neither will he have mercy on their fatherless and on their  widows; for every one is a hypocrite and an evildoer, and every  mouth speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned  away, and his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:18">9:18</a> For wickedness burneth as a fire: it devoureth briars and  thorns, and kindleth in the thickets of the forest, and they go  rolling up like a pillar of smoke.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:19">9:19</a> Through the wrath of Jehovah of hosts is the land burned  up, and the people is as fuel for fire: a man spareth not his  brother;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:20">9:20</a> and he snatcheth on the right hand, and is hungry, and  eateth on the left hand; and they are not satisfied. They eat  every man the flesh of his own arm:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_9:21">9:21</a> Manasseh, Ephraim, and Ephraim, Manasseh; [and] they  together are against Judah. For all this his anger is not  turned away, and his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:1">10:1</a> Woe unto them that decree iniquitous decrees, and to the  writers that prescribe oppression,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:2">10:2</a> to turn away the poor from judgment, and to take away the  right from the afflicted of my people; that widows may be their  prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:3">10:3</a> And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the  sudden destruction [which] shall come from far? To whom will ye  flee for help, and where will ye leave your glory?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:4">10:4</a> They can but crouch under the prisoners, and they shall  fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not turned  away, and his hand is stretched out still.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:5">10:5</a> Ah! the Assyrian! the rod of mine anger! and the staff in  their hand is mine indignation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:6">10:6</a> I will send him against a hypocritical nation, and against  the people of my wrath will I give him a charge; to take the  spoil, and to seize the prey, and to tread them down like the  mire of the streets.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:7">10:7</a> But he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so; for  it is in his heart to extirpate and cut off nations not a few.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:8">10:8</a> For he saith, Are not my princes all kings?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:9">10:9</a> Is not Calno as Karkemish? Is not Hamath as Arpad? Is not  Samaria as Damascus?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:10">10:10</a> As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, -- and  their graven images exceeded those of Jerusalem and Samaria,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:11">10:11</a> -- shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols,  so do to Jerusalem and her images?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:12">10:12</a> And it shall come to pass, when the Lord hath performed  his whole work upon mount Zion and upon Jerusalem, I will  punish the fruit of the stoutness of heart of the king of  Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:13">10:13</a> For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done [it],  and by my wisdom, for I am intelligent; and I have removed the  bounds of the peoples, and have robbed their treasures, and,  like a valiant man, I have brought down them that sit [on  thrones];</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:14">10:14</a> and my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the  peoples, and as one gathereth forsaken eggs, have I gathered  all the earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or  opened the mouth, or chirped.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:15">10:15</a> -- Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth  therewith? shall the saw magnify itself against him that  wieldeth it? As if the rod should wield them that lift it up;  as if the staff should lift up [him who is] not wood!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:16">10:16</a> Therefore shall the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, send among his  fat ones leanness, and under his glory he shall kindle a  burning, like the burning of a fire:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:17">10:17</a> and the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy  One for a flame; and it shall burn and devour his thorns and  his briars in one day,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:18">10:18</a> and it shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his  fruitful field, both soul and body; and they shall be as when a  sick man fainteth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:19">10:19</a> And the remainder of the trees of his forest shall be few:  yea, a child might write them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:20">10:20</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the remnant  of Israel and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob shall  no more again rely upon him that smote them; but they shall  rely upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:21">10:21</a> The remnant shall return, the remnant of Jacob, unto the  mighty ùGod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:22">10:22</a> For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea,  [only] a remnant of them shall return: the consumption  determined shall overflow in righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:23">10:23</a> For a consumption, and [one] determined, will the Lord,  Jehovah of hosts, accomplish in the midst of all the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:24">10:24</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts: O my  people that dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian; he  shall smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff  against thee, after the manner of Egypt:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:25">10:25</a> for yet a very little while, and the indignation shall be  accomplished, and mine anger, in their destruction.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:26">10:26</a> And Jehovah of hosts will stir up a scourge against him,  according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb; and  his rod [shall be] upon the sea, and he will lift it up after  the manner of Egypt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_10:27">10:27</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] his burden  shall be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from  off thy neck; and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the  anointing. ...</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:3">11:3</a> And his delight will be in the fear of Jehovah; and he  shall not judge after the sight of his eyes, neither reprove  after the hearing of his ears;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:4">11:4</a> but with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove  with equity the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the earth  with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips  shall he slay the wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:5">11:5</a> And righteousness shall be the girdle of his reins, and  faithfulness the girdle of his loins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_11:6">11:6</a> The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard  shall lie down with the kid, and the calf and the young lion  and the fatted beast together, and a little child shall lead  them.</p>

 <p><a name="an_11:12">11:12</a> And he shall lift up a banner to the nations, and shall  assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the  dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.</p>

 <p><a name="an_21:15">21:15</a> For they flee from the swords, from the drawn sword, and  from the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:16">21:16</a> For thus hath the Lord said unto me: Within a year,  according to the years of a hired servant, and all the glory of  Kedar shall fail;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_21:17">21:17</a> and the residue of the number of the archers, the mighty  men of the sons of Kedar, shall be diminished: for Jehovah, the  God of Israel, hath spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:1">22:1</a> The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now,  that thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:2">22:2</a> Thou that wast full of stir, a town of tumult, a joyous  city: thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in  battle.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:3">22:3</a> All thy rulers have fled together, they are taken prisoners  without the bow: all that are found of thee are made prisoners  together; they were fleeing far off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:4">22:4</a> Therefore said I, Look away from me; let me weep bitterly:  labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the  daughter of my people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:5">22:5</a> For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of  perplexity, from the Lord, Jehovah of hosts, in the valley of  vision; [a day of] breaking down the wall, and of crying to the  mountain:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:6">22:6</a> -- Elam beareth the quiver with chariots of men [and]  horsemen; and Kir uncovereth the shield.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:7">22:7</a> And it shall come to pass [that] thy choicest valleys shall  be full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in  array at the gate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:8">22:8</a> And he uncovereth the covering of Judah: and thou didst  look in that day to the armour in the house of the forest;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:9">22:9</a> and ye have seen the breaches of the city of David, that  they are many; and ye have gathered together the waters of the  lower pool;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:10">22:10</a> and ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and have  broken down the houses to fortify the wall;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:11">22:11</a> and ye have made a reservoir between the two walls for the  water of the old pool: but ye have not had regard unto the  maker thereof, neither have ye looked unto him that fashioned  it long ago.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:12">22:12</a> And in that day did the Lord Jehovah of hosts call to  weeping, and to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with  sackcloth;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:13">22:13</a> and behold joy and rejoicing, slaying oxen, and killing  sheep, eating flesh, and drinking wine: -- Let us eat and  drink, for to-morrow we die.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:14">22:14</a> And it was revealed in mine ears by Jehovah of hosts:  Assuredly this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye  die, saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:15">22:15</a> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah of hosts: Go, get thee in unto  this steward, unto Shebna, who is over the house, [and say,]</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:16">22:16</a> What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou  hast hewn thee out a sepulchre here, [as] he that heweth out  his sepulchre on high, cutting out in the rock a habitation for  himself?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:17">22:17</a> Behold, Jehovah will hurl thee with the force of a mighty  man, and will cover thee entirely.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:18">22:18</a> Rolling thee up completely, he will roll thee as a ball  into a wide country: there shalt thou die, and there shall be  the chariots of thy glory, O shame of thy lord's house!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:19">22:19</a> And I will drive thee from thine office, and from thy  station will I pull thee down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:20">22:20</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my  servant Eliakim the son of Hilkijah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:21">22:21</a> and I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him  with thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his  hand; and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem,  and to the house of Judah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:22">22:22</a> And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his  shoulder; and he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall  shut, and none shall open.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:23">22:23</a> And I will fasten him [as] a nail in a sure place; and he  shall be for a throne of glory to his father's house:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:24">22:24</a> and they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's  house, the offspring and the issue, all the small vessels, as  well the vessels of cups as all the vessels of flagons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_22:25">22:25</a> In that day, saith Jehovah of hosts, shall the nail that  is fastened in a sure place be removed, and be cut down, and  fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for  Jehovah hath spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:1">23:1</a> The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish! for it is  laid waste, so that there is no house, none entering in. From  the land of Chittim it is revealed to them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:2">23:2</a> Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle! The merchants of  Sidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:3">23:3</a> And on great waters, the seed of Shihor, the harvest of the  Nile, was her revenue; and she was the market of the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:4">23:4</a> Be thou ashamed, Sidon, for the sea hath spoken, the  strength of the sea, saying, I have not travailed nor brought  forth, neither have I nourished young men [nor] brought up  virgins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:5">23:5</a> -- When the report came into Egypt, they were sorely pained  at the news of Tyre.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:6">23:6</a> Pass over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the coast!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:7">23:7</a> Is this your joyous [city], whose antiquity is of ancient  days? Her feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:8">23:8</a> Who hath purposed this against Tyre, the distributor of  crowns, whose merchants were princes, whose dealers were the  honourable of the earth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:9">23:9</a> Jehovah of hosts hath purposed it, to profane the pride of  all glory, to bring to nought all the honourable of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:10">23:10</a> Overflow thy land like the Nile, daughter of Tarshish:  there is no more restraint.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:11">23:11</a> He hath stretched out his hand over the sea, he shaketh  the kingdoms. Jehovah hath given a commandment concerning  Canaan, to destroy the strongholds thereof,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:12">23:12</a> and hath said, Thou shalt no more exult, [thou] oppressed  virgin, daughter of Sidon: get thee up, pass over to Chittim;  even there shalt thou have no rest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:13">23:13</a> Behold the land of the Chaldeans: this people did not  exist; the Assyrian founded it for the dwellers in the desert:  they set up their towers, they destroyed the palaces thereof;  he brought it to ruin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:14">23:14</a> Howl, ships of Tarshish! for your fortress is laid waste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:15">23:15</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be  forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king. At  the end of seventy years it shall be for Tyre as the harlot's  song.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:16">23:16</a> Take a harp, go about the city, thou forgotten harlot!  Make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou mayest be  remembered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:17">23:17</a> And it shall come to pass at the end of seventy years,  that Jehovah will visit Tyre; and she will return to her hire,  and will commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the earth  upon the face of the ground.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_23:18">23:18</a> And her merchandise and her hire shall be holy to Jehovah:  it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her merchandise  shall be for them that dwell before Jehovah, to eat and be  sufficed, and for excellent clothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:1">24:1</a> Behold, Jehovah maketh the land empty, and maketh it waste,  and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad its  inhabitants.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:2">24:2</a> And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as  with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so with  her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as with  the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of usury,  so with him from whom usury is taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:3">24:3</a> The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled; for  Jehovah hath spoken this word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:4">24:4</a> The land mourneth, it fadeth away; the world languisheth,  it fadeth away: the haughty people of the land do languish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:5">24:5</a> And the land is polluted under the inhabitants thereof; for  they have violated the laws, changed the statute, broken the  everlasting covenant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:6">24:6</a> Therefore doth the curse devour the earth, and they that  dwell therein are held guilty; therefore the inhabitants of the  earth are consumed, and few men are left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:7">24:7</a> The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all that were  merry-hearted do sigh;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:8">24:8</a> the mirth of tambours ceaseth, the noise of them that  rejoice endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:9">24:9</a> They do not drink wine with a song; strong drink is bitter  to them that drink it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:10">24:10</a> The city of solitude is broken down; every house is shut  up, so that none entereth in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:11">24:11</a> There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is  darkened, the mirth of the land is gone;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:12">24:12</a> desolation remaineth in the city, and the gate is smitten,  -- a ruin.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:13">24:13</a> For so will it be in the midst of the land among the  peoples, as the shaking of an olive-tree, as the  grape-gleanings when the vintage is done.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:14">24:14</a> These shall lift up their voice, they shall shout for the  majesty of Jehovah, they shall cry aloud from the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:15">24:15</a> Therefore glorify Jehovah in the east, the name of  Jehovah, the God of Israel, in the isles of the west.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:16">24:16</a> From the end of the earth have we heard songs: Glory to  the righteous! And I said, My leanness, my leanness, woe unto  me! The treacherous have dealt treacherously; yea, the  treacherous have dealt very treacherously.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:17">24:17</a> Fear, and the pit, and the snare are upon thee, inhabitant  of the land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:18">24:18</a> And it shall come to pass, [that] he who fleeth from the  sound of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh  up out of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare; for  the windows on high are open, and the foundations of the earth  shake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:19">24:19</a> The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is completely  dissolved, the earth is violently moved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:20">24:20</a> The earth reeleth to and fro like a drunkard, and is  shaken like a night hut; and its transgression is heavy upon  it; and it falleth and shall not rise again.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:21">24:21</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] Jehovah will  punish the host of the high ones on high, and the kings of the  earth upon the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:22">24:22</a> And they shall be brought together, [as] an assemblage of  prisoners for the pit, and shall be shut up in prison, and  after many days shall they be visited.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_24:23">24:23</a> And the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed; for  Jehovah of hosts shall reign on mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,  and before his ancients in glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:1">25:1</a> Jehovah, thou art my God: I will exalt thee; I will  celebrate thy name, for thou hast done wonderful things;  counsels of old [which are] faithfulness [and] truth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:2">25:2</a> For thou hast made of the city a heap, of the fortified  town a ruin, the palace of strangers to be no city; it shall  never be built up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:3">25:3</a> Therefore shall the mighty people glorify thee, the city of  terrible nations shall fear thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:4">25:4</a> For thou hast been a fortress to the poor, a fortress for  the needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow  from the heat: for the blast of the terrible ones [has been] as  the storm [against] a wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:5">25:5</a> Thou hast subdued the tumult of strangers, as the heat in a  dry place; [as] the heat, by the shadow of a cloud, [so] the  song of the terrible ones is brought low.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:6">25:6</a> And in this mountain will Jehovah of hosts make unto all  peoples a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of  fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:7">25:7</a> And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the veil  which veileth all the peoples, and the covering that is spread  over all the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:8">25:8</a> He will swallow up death in victory. And the Lord Jehovah  will wipe away tears from off all faces; and the reproach of  his people will he take away from off all the earth: for  Jehovah hath spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:9">25:9</a> And it shall be said in that day, Behold, this is our God;  we have waited for him, and he will save us: this is Jehovah,  we have waited for him; we will be glad and rejoice in his  salvation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:10">25:10</a> For in this mountain shall the hand of Jehovah rest, and  Moab shall be trodden down under him, as straw is trodden down  in the dunghill;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:11">25:11</a> and he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them,  as he that swimmeth spreadeth them forth to swim; and he shall  bring down their pride together with the plots of their hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_25:12">25:12</a> And the fortress of the high defences of thy walls will he  bring down, lay low, bring to the ground, into the dust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:1">26:1</a> In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah:  We have a strong city; salvation doth he appoint for walls and  bulwarks.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:2">26:2</a> Open ye the gates, and the righteous nation which keepeth  faithfulness shall enter in.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:3">26:3</a> Thou wilt keep in perfect peace the mind stayed [on thee],  for he confideth in thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:4">26:4</a> Confide ye in Jehovah for ever; for in Jah, Jehovah, is the  rock of ages.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:5">26:5</a> For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty  city, he layeth it low, he layeth it low to the ground, he  bringeth it even to the dust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:6">26:6</a> The foot shall tread it down, -- the feet of the afflicted,  the steps of the poor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:7">26:7</a> The way of the just is uprightness: thou, the Upright, dost  make the path of the just even.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:8">26:8</a> Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O Jehovah, have we waited  for thee; the desire of [our] soul is to thy name, and to thy  memorial.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:9">26:9</a> With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my  spirit within me I seek thee early: for when thy judgments are  in the earth, the inhabitants of the world learn righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:10">26:10</a> If favour be shewn to the wicked, he doth not learn  righteousness: in the land of uprightness he dealeth unjustly,  and beholdeth not the majesty of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:11">26:11</a> Jehovah, thy hand is lifted up, but they do not see: [yet]  they shall see [thy] jealousy [for] the people, and be ashamed;  yea, the fire which is for thine adversaries shall devour them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:12">26:12</a> Jehovah, thou wilt ordain peace for us; for thou also hast  wrought all our works for us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:13">26:13</a> Jehovah our God, other lords than thee have had dominion  over us; by thee only will we make mention of thy name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:14">26:14</a> [They are] dead, they shall not live; deceased, they shall  not rise: for thou hast visited and destroyed them, and made  all memory of them to perish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:15">26:15</a> Thou hast increased the nation, Jehovah, thou hast  increased the nation: thou art glorified. Thou hadst removed  [it] far [unto] all the ends of the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:16">26:16</a> Jehovah, in trouble they sought thee; they poured out  [their] whispered prayer when thy chastening was upon them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:17">26:17</a> As a woman with child, that draweth near her delivery, is  in travail, [and] crieth out in her pangs; so have we been  before thee, Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:18">26:18</a> We have been with child, we have been in travail, we have  as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought the  deliverance of the land, neither have the inhabitants of the  world fallen.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:19">26:19</a> Thy dead shall live, my dead bodies shall arise. Awake and  sing in triumph, ye that dwell in dust; for thy dew is the dew  of the morning, and the earth shall cast forth the dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:20">26:20</a> Come, my people, enter into thy chambers, and shut thy  doors about thee; hide thyself just for a little moment, until  the indignation be past.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_26:21">26:21</a> For behold, Jehovah cometh out of his place to visit the  iniquity of the inhabitants of the earth upon them; and the  earth shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her  slain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:1">27:1</a> In that day Jehovah, with his sore and great and strong  sword, will visit leviathan the fleeing serpent, and leviathan  the crooked serpent; and he will slay the monster that is in  the sea.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:2">27:2</a> In that day [there shall be] a vineyard of pure wine; sing  concerning it:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:3">27:3</a> I Jehovah keep it, I will water it every moment; lest any  harm it, I will keep it night and day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:4">27:4</a> Fury is not in me. Oh that I had briars [and] thorns in  battle against me! I would march against them, I would burn  them together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:5">27:5</a> Or let him take hold of my strength; let him make peace  with me: [yea,] let him make peace with me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:6">27:6</a> In the future Jacob shall take root; Israel shall blossom  and bud, and they shall fill the face of the world with fruit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:7">27:7</a> Hath he smitten him according to the smiting of those that  smote him? Is he slain according to the slaughter of those  slain by him?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:8">27:8</a> In measure, when sending her away, didst thou contend with  her: he hath taken [her] away with his rough wind in the day of  the east wind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:9">27:9</a> By this, therefore, shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged;  and this is all the fruit of the taking away of his sin: when  he shall make all the stones of the altar as chalkstones that  are crumbled in pieces, -- the Asherahs and the sun-images  shall not stand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:10">27:10</a> For the fortified city is solitary, a habitation abandoned  and forsaken like a wilderness; there shall the calf feed, and  there shall he lie down, and consume its boughs.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:11">27:11</a> When its branches are withered they shall be broken off;  women shall come [and] set them on fire. For it is a people of  no intelligence; therefore he that made them will not have  mercy on them, and he who formed them will shew them no favour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:12">27:12</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, that Jehovah shall  beat out from the flood of the river unto the torrent of Egypt,  and ye shall be gathered one by one, [ye] children of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_27:13">27:13</a> And it shall come to pass in that day, [that] the great  trumpet shall be blown; and they shall come that were perishing  in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,  and they shall worship Jehovah in the holy mountain at  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:1">28:1</a> Woe to the crown of pride of the drunkards of Ephraim, and  to the fading flower of his glorious adornment, which is on the  head of the fat valley of them that are overcome with wine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:2">28:2</a> Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, as a storm  of hail [and] a destroying tempest; as a storm of mighty waters  overflowing, shall he cast down to the earth with might.</p>

 <p><a name="an_28:4">28:4</a> and the fading flower of his glorious adornment which is on  the head of the fat valley shall be like an early fig before  the summer: as soon as he that seeth it perceiveth it, scarcely  is it in his hand, he swalloweth it down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:5">28:5</a> In that day will Jehovah of hosts be for a crown of glory,  and for a diadem of beauty, unto the remnant of his people;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:6">28:6</a> and for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in  judgment, and for strength to them that turn the battle to the  gate.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:7">28:7</a> But these also have erred through wine, and through strong  drink are they gone astray. The priest and the prophet have  erred through strong drink; they are overpowered by wine, they  are gone astray through strong drink; they have erred in  vision, they have stumbled [in] judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:8">28:8</a> For all tables are full of filthy vomit, so that there is  no [more] place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:9">28:9</a> Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to  understand the report? Them that are weaned from the milk,  withdrawn from the breasts?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:10">28:10</a> For [it is] precept upon precept, precept upon precept;  line upon line, line upon line; here a little, there a little.  ...</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:11">28:11</a> For with stammering lips and a strange tongue will he  speak to this people;</p>

 <p><a name="an_28:13">28:13</a> And the word of Jehovah was unto them precept upon  precept, precept upon precept, line upon line, line upon line,  here a little, there a little: that they might go, and fall  backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:14">28:14</a> Therefore hear the word of Jehovah, ye scornful men, that  rule this people which is in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:15">28:15</a> For ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and  with Sheol have we made an agreement; when the overflowing  scourge shall pass through, it shall not come unto us; for we  have made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid  ourselves.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:16">28:16</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I lay for  foundation in Zion a stone, a tried stone, a precious  corner-stone, a sure foundation: he that trusteth shall not  make haste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:17">28:17</a> And I will appoint judgment for a line, and righteousness  for a plummet; and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of  lies, and the waters shall overflow the hiding-place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:18">28:18</a> And your covenant with death shall be annulled, and your  agreement with Sheol shall not stand; when the overflowing  scourge shall pass through, ye shall be trodden down by it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:19">28:19</a> As it passeth through it shall take you; for morning by  morning shall it pass through, by day and by night; and it  shall be terror only to understand the report.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:20">28:20</a> For the bed is too short to stretch oneself on, and the  covering too narrow when he would wrap himself in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:21">28:21</a> For Jehovah will rise up as on mount Perazim, he will be  moved with anger as in the valley of Gibeon; that he may do his  work, his strange work, and perform his act, his unwonted act.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:22">28:22</a> Now therefore be ye not scorners, lest your bonds be made  strong; for I have heard from the Lord Jehovah of hosts a  consumption, and [one] determined, upon the whole land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:23">28:23</a> Give ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:24">28:24</a> Doth the ploughman plough all day to sow? Is he [all day]  opening and breaking the clods of his land?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:25">28:25</a> Doth he not, when he hath levelled the face thereof, cast  abroad dill, and scatter cummin, and set the wheat in rows, and  the barley in an appointed place, and the rye in its border?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:26">28:26</a> His God doth instruct him in [his] judgment, he doth teach  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:27">28:27</a> For the dill is not threshed with a threshing instrument,  neither is a cart-wheel turned about upon the cummin; but dill  is beaten out with a staff, and cummin with a rod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:28">28:28</a> Bread [corn] is crushed, because he will not ever be  threshing it; and if he drove the wheels of his cart and his  horses [over it], he would not crush it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_28:29">28:29</a> This also cometh forth from Jehovah of hosts; he is  wonderful in counsel, great in wisdom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:1">29:1</a> Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city of David's encampment! Add  ye year to year; let the feasts come round.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:2">29:2</a> But I will distress Ariel, and there shall be sorrow and  sadness; and it shall be unto me as an Ariel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:3">29:3</a> And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay  siege against thee with watch-posts, and I will raise forts  against thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:4">29:4</a> And thou shalt be brought low, thou shalt speak out of the  ground, and thy speech shall come low out of the dust, and thy  voice shall be as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of  the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:5">29:5</a> And the multitude of thine enemies shall be like small  dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones as chaff that  passeth away; and it shall be in an instant, suddenly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:6">29:6</a> Thou shalt be visited by Jehovah of hosts with thunder and  with earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and tempest,  and the flame of devouring fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:7">29:7</a> And the multitude of all the nations that war against  Ariel, even all that war against her and her fortifications,  and that distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:8">29:8</a> It shall even be as when the hungry dreameth, and, behold,  he eateth; and he awaketh, and his soul is empty; or as when  the thirsty dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; and he awaketh,  and, behold, he is faint, and his soul craveth: so shall the  multitude of all the nations be that war against mount Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:9">29:9</a> Be astounded and astonished, blind yourselves and be blind!  They are drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with  strong drink.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:10">29:10</a> For Jehovah hath poured out upon you a spirit of deep  sleep, and hath closed your eyes; the prophets and your chiefs,  the seers, hath he covered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:11">29:11</a> And the whole vision is become unto you as the words of a  book that is sealed, which they give to one that can read,  saying, Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot, for it  is sealed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:12">29:12</a> And they give the book to him that cannot read, saying,  Read this, I pray thee; and he saith, I cannot read.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:13">29:13</a> And the Lord saith, Forasmuch as this people draw near  with their mouth, and honour me with their lips, but their  heart is removed far from me, and their fear of me is a  commandment taught of men;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:14">29:14</a> therefore, behold, I will proceed to do marvellously with  this people, to do marvellously, even with wonder, and the  wisdom of their wise [men] shall perish, and the understanding  of their intelligent ones shall be hid.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:15">29:15</a> Woe unto them that hide deep, far from Jehovah, their  counsel! And their works are in the dark, and they say, Who  seeth us? and who knoweth us?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:16">29:16</a> [Oh] your perverseness! -- Shall the potter be esteemed as  the clay, so that the work should say of him that made it, He  made me not; or the thing formed say of him that formed it, He  hath no understanding?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:17">29:17</a> Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be  turned into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be  esteemed as a forest?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:18">29:18</a> And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book,  and, out of obscurity and out of darkness, the eyes of the  blind shall see;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:19">29:19</a> and the meek shall increase their joy in Jehovah, and the  needy among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:20">29:20</a> For the terrible one shall come to nought, and the scorner  shall be no more, and all that watch for iniquity shall be cut  off,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:21">29:21</a> that make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare  for him that reproveth in the gate, and pervert [the judgment  of] the righteous by futility.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:22">29:22</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah who redeemed Abraham,  concerning the house of Jacob: Jacob shall not now be ashamed,  neither shall his face now be pale;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:23">29:23</a> for when he seeth his children, the work of my hands, in  the midst of him, they shall hallow my name, and hallow the  Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_29:24">29:24</a> And they that are of erring spirit shall know  understanding, and the disobedient shall learn doctrine.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:1">30:1</a> Woe to the rebellious children, saith Jehovah, who take  counsel, but not of me, and who make leagues, but not by my  Spirit, that they may heap sin upon sin;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:2">30:2</a> who walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked of my  mouth, -- to take refuge under the protection of Pharaoh, and  trust in the shadow of Egypt!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:3">30:3</a> For to you the protection of Pharaoh shall be a shame, and  the trust in the shadow of Egypt a confusion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:4">30:4</a> For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to  Hanes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:5">30:5</a> They were all ashamed of a people [that] did not profit  them, nor were a help or profit, but a shame, and also a  reproach.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:6">30:6</a> -- The burden of the beasts of the south: Through a land of  trouble and anguish, whence come the lioness and lion, the  viper and fiery flying serpent, they carry their riches upon  the shoulders of asses, and their treasures upon the bunches of  camels, to the people that shall not profit [them].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:7">30:7</a> For Egypt shall help in vain, and to no purpose; therefore  have I named her, Arrogance, that doeth nothing.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:8">30:8</a> Now go, write it before them on a tablet, and record it in  a book, that it may be for the time to come, as a witness for  ever,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:9">30:9</a> that this is a rebellious people, lying children, children  that will not hear the law of Jehovah;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:10">30:10</a> who say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets,  Prophesy not unto us right things; speak unto us smooth things,  prophesy deceits;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:11">30:11</a> get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause  the Holy One of Israel to cease from before us!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:12">30:12</a> Therefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel: Because ye  reject this word, and confide in oppression and wilfulness, and  depend thereon,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:13">30:13</a> therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready  to fall, swelling out in a towering wall, whose breaking shall  come suddenly in an instant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:14">30:14</a> And he shall break it as the breaking of a potter's  vessel, that is broken in pieces unsparingly; and in the pieces  of it there shall not be found a sherd to take fire from the  hearth, or to scoop water out of the cistern.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:15">30:15</a> For thus saith the Lord Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel:  In returning and rest shall ye be saved, in quietness and  confidence shall be your strength; but ye would not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:16">30:16</a> And ye said, No, but we will flee upon horses, --  therefore shall ye flee; and, We will ride upon the swift, --  therefore shall they that pursue you be swift.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:17">30:17</a> One thousand [shall flee] at the rebuke of one; at the  rebuke of five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon  the top of a mountain, and as a banner on a hill.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:18">30:18</a> And therefore will Jehovah wait, that he may be gracious  unto you, and therefore will he lift himself up, that he may  have mercy upon you; for Jehovah is a God of judgment: blessed  are all they that wait for him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:19">30:19</a> For the people shall dwell in Zion, at Jerusalem. Thou  shalt weep no more; he will be very gracious unto thee at the  voice of thy cry; as he heareth it, he will answer thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:20">30:20</a> And the Lord will give you the bread of adversity, and the  water of oppression; yet thy teachers shall not be hidden any  more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:21">30:21</a> And when ye turn to the right hand or when ye turn to the  left, thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is  the way, walk ye in it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:22">30:22</a> And ye shall defile the silver covering of your graven  images, and the gold overlaying of your molten images; thou  shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth: Out! shalt thou say  unto it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:23">30:23</a> And he will give the rain of thy seed with which thou  shalt sow the ground; and bread, the produce of the ground, and  it shall be fat and rich. In that day shall thy cattle feed in  large pastures;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:24">30:24</a> and the oxen and the asses that till the ground shall eat  salted provender, which hath been winnowed with the shovel and  with the fan.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:25">30:25</a> And there shall be upon every high mountain and upon every  hill that is lifted up, brooks [and] water-courses, in the day  of the great slaughter, when the towers fall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:26">30:26</a> And the light of the moon shall be as the light of the  sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light  of seven days, in the day that Jehovah bindeth up the breach of  his people, and healeth the wound of their stroke.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:27">30:27</a> Behold, the name of Jehovah cometh from far, burning  [with] his anger -- a grievous conflagration; his lips are full  of indignation, and his tongue as a consuming fire;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:28">30:28</a> and his breath as an overflowing torrent, which reacheth  even to the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of  destruction, and [to put] a bridle into the jaws of the  peoples, that causeth them to go astray.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:29">30:29</a> Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a feast is  sanctified; and joy of heart, as of one who goeth with a pipe  to come unto the mountain of Jehovah, to the Rock of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:30">30:30</a> And Jehovah will cause the majesty of his voice to be  heard, and will shew the lighting down of his arm with  indignation of anger, and a flame of consuming fire, with  waterflood and storm and hailstones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:31">30:31</a> For through the voice of Jehovah shall the Assyrian be  broken down: he will smite [him] with the rod.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:32">30:32</a> And wherever shall pass the appointed staff, which Jehovah  shall lay upon him, it shall be with tambours and harps; and  with tumultuous battles will he fight with it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_30:33">30:33</a> For Topheth is prepared of old; for the king also it is  prepared: he hath made it deep and large; its pile is fire and  much wood; the breath of Jehovah, like a stream of brimstone,  doth kindle it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:1">31:1</a> Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help, and depend on  horses, and confide in chariots because [they are] many, and in  horsemen because they are very strong; and who look not unto  the Holy One of Israel, neither seek Jehovah!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:2">31:2</a> But he also is wise, and he bringeth evil, and recalleth  not his words; and he will arise against the house of  evildoers, and against the help of workers of iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:3">31:3</a> And the Egyptians are men, and not ùGod, and their horses  flesh, and not spirit; and Jehovah shall stretch forth his  hand, and he that helpeth shall stumble, and he that is helped  shall fall, and they all shall perish together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:4">31:4</a> For thus hath Jehovah said unto me: Like as the lion and  the young lion growling over his prey, when a multitude of  shepherds is called forth against him, is not afraid of their  voice, nor giveth way before the multitude of them; so will  Jehovah of hosts come down to war upon mount Zion, and on the  hill thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:5">31:5</a> As birds with outstretched wings, so will Jehovah of hosts  cover Jerusalem; covering, he will also deliver, passing over,  he will rescue [it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:6">31:6</a> Turn unto him from whom ye have deeply revolted, ye  children of Israel;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:7">31:7</a> for in that day every man shall cast away his idols of  silver and his idols of gold, which your sinful hands have made  unto you.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:8">31:8</a> And Asshur shall fall by the sword, not of a great man; and  the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: and he shall  flee from the sword, and his young men shall become tributary;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_31:9">31:9</a> and for fear, he shall pass over to his rock, and his  princes shall be afraid of the banner, saith Jehovah, whose  fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:1">32:1</a> Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes  shall rule in judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:2">32:2</a> And a man shall be as a hiding-place from the wind, and a  covert from the storm; as brooks of water in a dry place, as  the shadow of a great rock in a thirsty land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:3">32:3</a> And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the  ears of them that hear shall hearken;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:4">32:4</a> and the heart of the rash shall understand knowledge, and  the tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:5">32:5</a> The vile man shall be no more called noble, nor the churl  said to be bountiful:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:6">32:6</a> for the vile man will speak villainy, and his heart will  work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error  against Jehovah, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and to  cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:7">32:7</a> The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth  wicked devices to destroy the meek with lying words, even when  the needy speaketh right.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:8">32:8</a> But the noble deviseth noble things; and to noble things  doth he stand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:9">32:9</a> Rise up, ye women that are at ease, hear my voice; ye  careless daughters, give ear unto my speech.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:10">32:10</a> In a year and [some] days shall ye be troubled, ye  careless women; for the vintage shall fail, the ingathering  shall not come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:11">32:11</a> Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye  careless ones; strip you, and make you bare, and gird  [sackcloth] on your loins!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:12">32:12</a> They shall smite on the breasts [in lamentation] for the  pleasant fields, for the fruitful vineyards.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:13">32:13</a> Upon the land of my people shall come up thistles [and]  briars, yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:14">32:14</a> For the palace shall be deserted, the multitude of the  city shall be forsaken; hill and watchtower shall be caves for  ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:15">32:15</a> until the Spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the  wilderness become a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be  counted for a forest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:16">32:16</a> And judgment shall inhabit the wilderness, and  righteousness dwell in the fruitful field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:17">32:17</a> And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the  effect of righteousness, quietness and assurance for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:18">32:18</a> And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and  in sure dwellings, and in quiet resting-places.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:19">32:19</a> And it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city  shall be low in a low place.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_32:20">32:20</a> Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth  the feet of the ox and the ass.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:1">33:1</a> Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and  that dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously  with thee! When thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be  spoiled; when thou shalt make an end of dealing treacherously,  they shall deal treacherously with thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:2">33:2</a> Jehovah, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be  their arm every morning, yea, our salvation in the time of  trouble.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:3">33:3</a> At the noise of the tumult the peoples fled; at the lifting  up of thyself the nations were scattered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:4">33:4</a> And your spoil shall be gathered [like] the gathering of  the caterpillar: as the running of locusts shall they run upon  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_33:5">33:5</a> Jehovah is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled  Zion with justice and righteousness;</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:16">33:16</a> he shall dwell on high, the fortresses of the rocks shall  be his high retreat; bread shall be given him, his water shall  be sure.</p>

 <p><a name="an_33:20">33:20</a> Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes  shall see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tent that shall not  be removed, the stakes whereof shall never be pulled up,  neither shall any of its cords be broken;</p>

 <p><a name="an_36:3">36:3</a> Then came forth to him Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, who was  over the household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of  Asaph, the chronicler.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:4">36:4</a> And Rab-shakeh said to them, Say now to Hezekiah, Thus says  the great king, the king of Assyria: What confidence is this in  which thou trustest?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:5">36:5</a> Thou sayest, but it is a word of the lips, [There is]  counsel and strength for war. Now on whom dost thou rely, that  thou hast revolted against me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:6">36:6</a> Behold, thou reliest upon the staff of that broken reed,  upon Egypt, on which if a man lean, it goes into his hand, and  pierces it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that rely upon  him.</p>

 <p><a name="an_36:11">36:11</a> And Eliakim and Shebna and Joah said to Rab-shakeh, Speak,  we pray thee, to thy servants in Syriac, for we understand it;  and speak not to us in the Jewish [language] in the ears of the  people that are upon the wall.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:12">36:12</a> And Rab-shakeh said, Is it to thy master and to thee that  my master sent me to speak these words? Is it not to the men  that sit on the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and  drink their own urine with you?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:13">36:13</a> And Rab-shakeh stood and cried with a loud voice in the  Jewish [language], and said, Hear the words of the great king,  the king of Assyria!</p>

 <p><a name="an_36:17">36:17</a> until I come and take you away to a land like your own  land, a land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.</p>

 <p><a name="an_36:21">36:21</a> And they were silent, and answered him not a word; for the  king's command was, saying, Answer him not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_36:22">36:22</a> And Eliakim the son of Hilkijah, who was over the  household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah the son of Asaph,  the chronicler, came to Hezekiah, with their garments rent, and  told him the words of Rab-shakeh.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:1">37:1</a> And it came to pass when king Hezekiah heard [it], that he  rent his garments, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went  into the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:2">37:2</a> And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna  the scribe, and the elders of the priests, covered with  sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amoz.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:3">37:3</a> And they said to him, Thus says Hezekiah: This day is a day  of trouble, and of rebuke, and of reviling; for the children  are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring  forth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:4">37:4</a> It may be Jehovah thy God will hear the words of  Rab-shakeh, whom the king of Assyria his master has sent to  reproach the living God, and will rebuke the words which  Jehovah thy God hath heard. Therefore lift up a prayer for the  remnant that is left.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:5">37:5</a> And the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:6">37:6</a> And Isaiah said to them, Thus shall ye say to your master,  Thus saith Jehovah: Be not afraid of the words that thou hast  heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have  blasphemed me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:7">37:7</a> Behold, I will put a spirit into him, and he shall hear  tidings, and shall return to his own land; and I will cause him  to fall by the sword in his own land.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:8">37:8</a> And Rab-shakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria  warring against Libnah; for he had heard that he had departed  from Lachish.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:9">37:9</a> And he heard say of Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He has come  forth to make war with thee. And when he heard [it], he sent  messengers to Hezekiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:10">37:10</a> Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying: Let  not thy God, upon whom thou reliest, deceive thee, saying,  Jerusalem shall not be delivered into the hand of the king of  Assyria.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:11">37:11</a> Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have  done to all countries, destroying them utterly; and shalt thou  be delivered?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:12">37:12</a> Have the gods of the nations which my fathers have  destroyed delivered them, Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the  children of Eden that were in Thelassar?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:13">37:13</a> Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arpad, and  the king of the city of Sepharvaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:14">37:14</a> And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the  messengers, and read it; and Hezekiah went up into the house of  Jehovah, and spread it before Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:15">37:15</a> And Hezekiah prayed to Jehovah, saying,</p>

 <p><a name="an_37:17">37:17</a> Incline thine ear, O Jehovah, and hear; open, Jehovah,  thine eyes, and see; and hear all the words of Sennacherib, who  hath sent to reproach the living God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:18">37:18</a> Of a truth, Jehovah, the kings of Assyria have laid waste  all the lands, and their countries,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:19">37:19</a> and have cast their gods into the fire; for they were no  gods, but the work of men's hands, wood and stone; and they  have destroyed them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:20">37:20</a> And now, Jehovah our God, save us out of his hand, that  all the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art Jehovah,  thou only.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:21">37:21</a> And Isaiah the son of Amoz sent to Hezekiah, saying, Thus  saith Jehovah the God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me  concerning Sennacherib king of Assyria,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:22">37:22</a> this is the word which Jehovah hath spoken against him:  The virgin-daughter of Zion despiseth thee, laugheth thee to  scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem shaketh her head at thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:23">37:23</a> Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom  hast thou exalted the voice? Against the Holy One of Israel  hast thou lifted up thine eyes on high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:24">37:24</a> By thy servants thou hast reproached the Lord, and hast  said, With the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the  height of the mountains, to the recesses of Lebanon; and I will  cut down its tall cedars, the choice of its cypresses; and I  will enter into its furthest height, [into] the forest of its  fruitful field.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:25">37:25</a> I have digged and drunk water; and with the sole of my  feet have I dried up all the streams of Matsor.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:26">37:26</a> Hast thou not heard that long ago I did it, and that from  ancient days I formed it? Now have I brought it to pass, that  thou shouldest lay waste fortified cities [into] ruinous heaps.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:27">37:27</a> And their inhabitants were powerless, they were dismayed  and put to shame; they were [as] the grass of the field and the  green herb, [as] the grass on the housetops, and grain blighted  before it be grown up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:28">37:28</a> But I know thine abode, and thy going out, and thy coming  in, and thy raging against me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:29">37:29</a> Because thy raging against me and thine arrogance is come  up into mine ears, I will put my ring in thy nose, and my  bridle in thy lips, and I will make thee go back by the way by  which thou camest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:30">37:30</a> And this [shall be] the sign unto thee: there shall be  eaten this year such as groweth of itself; and in the second  year that which springeth of the same; but in the third year  sow ye, and reap, and plant vineyards and eat the fruit  thereof.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:31">37:31</a> And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah  shall again take root downward, and bear fruit upward;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:32">37:32</a> for out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and out of  mount Zion they that escape: the zeal of Jehovah of hosts shall  do this.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:33">37:33</a> Therefore thus saith Jehovah concerning the king of  Assyria: He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow  there, nor come before it with shield, nor cast a bank against  it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:34">37:34</a> By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and  shall not come into this city, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:35">37:35</a> And I will defend this city, to save it, for mine own  sake, and for my servant David's sake.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_37:36">37:36</a> And an angel of Jehovah went forth, and smote in the camp  of the Assyrians a hundred and eighty-five thousand. And when  they arose early in the morning, behold, they were all dead  bodies.</p>

 <p><a name="an_37:38">37:38</a> And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of  Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote  him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Ararat.  And Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:1">38:1</a> In those days Hezekiah was sick unto death. And the prophet  Isaiah the son of Amoz came to him, and said to him, Thus saith  Jehovah: Set thy house in order; for thou shalt die, and not  live.</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:3">38:3</a> and said, Ah, Jehovah, remember, I beseech thee, how I have  walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have  done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept much.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:4">38:4</a> And the word of Jehovah came to Isaiah, saying,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:5">38:5</a> Go and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith Jehovah, the God of  David thy father: I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy  tears: behold, I will add to thy days fifteen years.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:6">38:6</a> And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of  the king of Assyria, and I will defend this city.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:7">38:7</a> And this [shall be] the sign to thee from Jehovah, that  Jehovah will do this thing that he hath spoken:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:8">38:8</a> behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees which  hath gone down with the sun on the dial of Ahaz, ten degrees  backward. So the sun returned on the dial ten degrees, by which  it had gone down.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:9">38:9</a> The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been  sick and had recovered from his sickness:</p>

 <p><a name="an_38:11">38:11</a> I said, I shall not see Jah, Jah in the land of the  living. With those who dwell where all has ceased to be, I  shall behold man no more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_38:12">38:12</a> Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a  shepherd's tent. I have cut off like a weaver my life. He  separateth me from the thrum: -- from day to night thou wilt  make an end of me.</p>

 <p><a name="an_44:24">44:24</a> Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, and he that formed thee  from the womb: I [am] Jehovah, the maker of all things; who  alone stretched out the heavens, who did spread forth the earth  by myself;</p>

 <p><a name="an_44:26">44:26</a> that confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth  the counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou  shalt be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be  built up, and I will raise up their ruins;</p>

 <p><a name="an_45:1">45:1</a> Thus saith Jehovah to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right  hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him -- and I will  loose the loins of kings; to open before him the two-leaved  doors, and the gates shall not be shut:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:2">45:2</a> I will go before thee, and make the elevated places plain;  I will break in pieces the brazen doors, and cut asunder the  bars of iron;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:3">45:3</a> and I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden  riches of secret places; that thou mayest know that I, Jehovah,  who call thee by name, [am] the God of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:4">45:4</a> For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have  called thee by thy name; I surnamed thee, though thou didst not  know me;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:5">45:5</a> I [am] Jehovah, and there is none else; there is no God  beside me: I girded thee, and thou hast not known me;</p>

 <p><a name="an_45:10">45:10</a> Woe unto him that saith unto [his] father, What begettest  thou? Or to [his] mother, What hast thou brought forth?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_45:11">45:11</a> Thus saith Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker:  Ask me of the things to come; concerning my sons, and  concerning the work of my hands, command ye me.</p>

 <p><a name="an_45:15">45:15</a> Verily thou art a ùGod that hidest thyself, O God of  Israel, the Saviour. ...</p>

 <p><a name="an_45:19">45:19</a> I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth;  I said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek me in vain: I [am]  Jehovah, speaking righteousness, declaring things which are  right.</p>

 <p><a name="an_47:8">47:8</a> And now hear this, thou voluptuous one, that dwellest  carelessly, that sayest in thy heart, It is I, and there is  none but me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know  loss of children:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:9">47:9</a> yet these two things shall come upon thee in a moment, in  one day, loss of children and widowhood; they shall come upon  thee in full measure for the multitude of thy sorceries, for  the great abundance of thine enchantments.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_47:10">47:10</a> For thou hast confided in thy wickedness: thou hast said,  None seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath seduced  thee; and thou hast said in thy heart, It is I, and there is  none but me.</p>

 <p><a name="an_48:6">48:6</a> Thou heardest, see all this; -- and ye, will not ye declare  [it]? I have caused thee to hear new things from this time, and  things hidden, and that thou knewest not:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:7">48:7</a> they are created now, and not long ago; and before this day  thou hast not heard them, lest thou shouldest say, Behold, I  knew them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:8">48:8</a> Yea, thou heardest not, yea, thou knewest not, yea, from of  old thine ear was not opened; for I knew that thou wouldest  ever deal treacherously, and thou wast called a transgressor  from the womb.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:9">48:9</a> For my name's sake I will defer mine anger, and [for] my  praise will I refrain as to thee, that I cut thee not off.</p>

 <p><a name="an_48:11">48:11</a> For mine own sake, for mine own sake, will I do [it]; for  how should [my name] be profaned? and I will not give my glory  unto another.</p>

 <p><a name="an_48:13">48:13</a> Yea, my hand hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my  right hand hath spread abroad the heavens: I call unto them,  they stand up together.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:14">48:14</a> All ye, gather yourselves together, and hear: which among  them hath declared these things? He whom Jehovah hath loved  shall execute his pleasure on Babylon, and his arm [shall be  on] the Chaldeans.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:15">48:15</a> I, [even] I, have spoken; yea, I have called him; I have  brought him, and his way shall be prosperous.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:16">48:16</a> Come near unto me, hear ye this: I have not spoken in  secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am  I; and now the Lord Jehovah hath sent me, and his Spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:17">48:17</a> Thus saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;  I [am] Jehovah thy God, who teacheth thee for [thy] profit, who  leadeth thee in the way that thou shouldest go.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:18">48:18</a> Oh that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! Then  would thy peace have been as a river, and thy righteousness as  the waves of the sea;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:19">48:19</a> and thy seed would have been as the sand, and the  offspring of thy bowels like the gravel thereof: their name  should not have been cut off nor destroyed from before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:20">48:20</a> Go ye forth from Babylon, flee from the Chaldeans, with a  voice of singing; declare, cause this to be heard, utter it to  the end of the earth; say ye, Jehovah hath redeemed his servant  Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:21">48:21</a> And they thirsted not when he led them through the  deserts; he caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them;  yea, he clave the rock, and the waters gushed out.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_48:22">48:22</a> There is no peace, saith Jehovah, unto the wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:1">49:1</a> Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye peoples from  afar. Jehovah hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of  my mother hath he made mention of my name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:2">49:2</a> And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword, he hath  concealed me under the shadow of his hand, and he hath made me  a polished shaft: in his quiver hath he hidden me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:3">49:3</a> And he said unto me, Thou art my servant, Israel, in whom I  will glorify myself.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:4">49:4</a> -- And I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my  strength for nought and in vain; nevertheless my judgment is  with Jehovah, and my work with my God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:5">49:5</a> And now, saith Jehovah, that formed me from the womb to be  his servant, that I should bring Jacob again to him; (though  Israel be not gathered, yet shall I be glorified in the eyes of  Jehovah, and my God shall be my strength;)</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:6">49:6</a> -- and he saith, It is a small thing that thou shouldest be  my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the  preserved of Israel; I have even given thee for a light of the  nations, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the  earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:7">49:7</a> Thus saith Jehovah, the Redeemer of Israel, his Holy One,  to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth, to  the servant of rulers: Kings shall see and arise, princes, and  they shall worship, because of Jehovah who is faithful, the  Holy One of Israel, who hath chosen thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:8">49:8</a> Thus saith Jehovah: In a time of acceptance have I answered  thee, and in the day of salvation have I helped thee; and I  will preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people,  to establish the land, to cause to inherit the desolate  heritages;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:9">49:9</a> saying to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that are in  darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways, and  their pasture shall be on all bare hills.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:10">49:10</a> They shall not hunger nor thirst, neither shall the heat  nor sun smite them; for he that hath mercy on them will lead  them, and by the springs of water will he guide them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:11">49:11</a> And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways  shall be raised up.</p>

 <p><a name="an_49:13">49:13</a> Shout, ye heavens; and be joyful, thou earth; and break  forth into singing, ye mountains: for Jehovah hath comforted  his people, and will have mercy upon his afflicted ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:14">49:14</a> But Zion said, Jehovah hath forsaken me, and the Lord hath  forgotten me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:15">49:15</a> Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not  have compassion on the son of her womb? Even these forget, but  I will not forget thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:16">49:16</a> Lo, I have graven thee upon the palms of [my] hands; thy  walls are continually before me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:17">49:17</a> Thy sons shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that  laid thee waste shall go forth from thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:18">49:18</a> Lift up thine eyes round about and behold: they all gather  themselves together, they come to thee. As I live, saith  Jehovah, thou shalt indeed clothe thee with them all as with an  ornament, and bind them on as a bride doth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:19">49:19</a> For [in] thy waste and thy desolate places, and thy  destroyed land, thou shalt even now be too straitened by reason  of the inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be  far away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:20">49:20</a> The children of thy bereavement shall yet say in thine  ears, The place is too narrow for me: make room for me, that I  may dwell.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:21">49:21</a> And thou shalt say in thy heart, Who hath borne me these,  seeing I had lost my children and was desolate, an exile, and  driven about? and who hath brought up these? behold, I was left  alone; these, where were they?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:22">49:22</a> Thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, I will lift up my  hand to the nations, and set up my banner to the peoples; and  they shall bring thy sons in [their] bosom, and thy daughters  shall be carried upon the shoulder.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:23">49:23</a> And kings shall be thy nursing-fathers, and their  princesses thy nursing-mothers: they shall bow down to thee  with the face toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy  feet. And thou shalt know that I [am] Jehovah; for they shall  not be ashamed who wait on me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:24">49:24</a> Shall the prey be taken from the mighty? and shall he that  is rightfully captive be delivered?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:25">49:25</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Even the captive of the mighty  shall be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be  delivered; and I will strive with him that striveth with thee,  and I will save thy children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_49:26">49:26</a> And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own  flesh; and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with  new wine. And all flesh shall know that I, Jehovah, [am] thy  Saviour and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:1">50:1</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Where is the bill of your mother's  divorce, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is it  to whom I have sold you? Behold, through your iniquities have  ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother  put away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:2">50:2</a> Wherefore did I come, and there was no man? I called, and  there was none to answer?

 <p><a name="an_50:3">50:3</a> I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth  their covering.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:4">50:4</a> The Lord Jehovah hath given me the tongue of the  instructed, that I should know how to succour by a word him  that is weary. He wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine  ear to hear as the instructed.</p>

 <p><a name="an_50:6">50:6</a> I gave my back to smiters, and my cheeks to them that  plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from shame and  spitting.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:7">50:7</a> But the Lord Jehovah will help me: therefore shall I not be  confounded; therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I  know that I shall not be ashamed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:8">50:8</a> He is near that justifieth me: who will contend with me?  let us stand together; who is mine adverse party? let him draw  near unto me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_50:9">50:9</a> Behold, the Lord Jehovah will help me; who is he that shall  condemn me? Behold, they all shall grow old as a garment; the  moth shall eat them up.</p>

 <p><a name="an_50:11">50:11</a> Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves  about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and among  the sparks [that] ye have kindled. This shall ye have of my  hand: ye shall lie down in sorrow.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:1">51:1</a> Hearken unto me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye  that seek Jehovah: look unto the rock [whence] ye were hewn,  and to the hole of the pit [whence] ye were digged.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:2">51:2</a> Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bore  you; for I called him when he was alone, and blessed him, and  multiplied him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:3">51:3</a> For Jehovah shall comfort Zion, he shall comfort all her  waste places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and  her desert like the garden of Jehovah: gladness and joy shall  be found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of song.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:4">51:4</a> Listen unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, my nation:  for a law shall proceed from me, and I will establish my  judgment for a light of the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:5">51:5</a> My righteousness is near, my salvation is gone forth, and  mine arms shall judge the peoples: the isles shall wait for me,  and in mine arm shall they trust.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:6">51:6</a> Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look on the earth  beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the  earth shall grow old like a garment, and they that dwell  therein shall die in like manner; but my salvation shall be for  ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:7">51:7</a> Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in  whose heart is my law; fear not the reproach of men, and be not  afraid of their revilings.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:8">51:8</a> For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm  shall eat them like wool; but my righteousness shall be for  ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:9">51:9</a> Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah; awake, as  in the days of old, [as in] the generations of passed ages. Is  it not thou that hath hewn Rahab in pieces, [and] pierced the  monster?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:10">51:10</a> Is it not thou that dried up the sea, the waters of the  great deep; that made the depths of the sea a way for the  redeemed to pass over?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:11">51:11</a> So the ransomed of Jehovah shall return, and come to Zion  with singing; and everlasting joy shall be upon their heads:  they shall obtain gladness and joy; sorrow and sighing shall  flee away.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:12">51:12</a> I, [even] I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that  thou fearest a man that shall die, and the son of man that  shall become as grass;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:13">51:13</a> and forgettest Jehovah thy Maker, who hath stretched out  the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and thou  art afraid continually all the day because of the fury of the  oppressor, when he prepareth to destroy? And where is the fury  of the oppressor?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:14">51:14</a> He that is bowed down shall speedily be loosed, and he  shall not die in the pit, nor shall his bread fail.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:15">51:15</a> And I am Jehovah thy God, who raiseth the sea, so that its  waves roar: Jehovah of hosts is his name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:16">51:16</a> And I have put my words in thy mouth, and covered thee  with the shadow of my hand, to plant the heavens, and to lay  the foundations of the earth, and to say unto Zion, Thou art my  people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:17">51:17</a> Arouse thyself, arouse thyself, stand up, Jerusalem, which  hast drunk at the hand of Jehovah the cup of his fury. Thou  hast drunk, hast drained out the goblet-cup of bewilderment:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:18">51:18</a> -- there is none to guide her among all the children that  she hath brought forth; neither is there any to take her by the  hand of all the children that she hath brought up.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:19">51:19</a> These two [things] are come unto thee; who will bemoan  thee? -- desolation and destruction, and famine and sword: how  shall I comfort thee?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:20">51:20</a> Thy children have fainted, they lie at the head of all the  streets, as an oryx in a net: they are full of the fury of  Jehovah, the rebuke of thy God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:21">51:21</a> Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but  not with wine:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:22">51:22</a> thus saith thy Lord, Jehovah, and thy God, who pleadeth  the cause of his people, Behold, I take out of thy hand the cup  of bewilderment, the goblet-cup of my fury; thou shalt no more  drink it again:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_51:23">51:23</a> and I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;  who have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over; and  thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street to  them that went over.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:1">52:1</a> Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy  beautiful garments, Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth  there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the  unclean.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:2">52:2</a> Shake thyself from the dust; arise, sit down, Jerusalem:  loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, captive daughter of  Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:3">52:3</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Ye have sold yourselves for nought,  and ye shall be redeemed without money.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:4">52:4</a> For thus saith the Lord Jehovah: My people went down at the  first into Egypt to sojourn there, and Assyria oppressed them  without cause;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:5">52:5</a> and now, what have I here, saith Jehovah, that my people  hath been taken away for nought? They that rule over them make  them to howl, saith Jehovah; and continually all the day is my  name scorned.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:6">52:6</a> Therefore my people shall know my name; therefore [they  shall know] in that day that I [am] HE, that saith, Here am I.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:7">52:7</a> How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that  announceth glad tidings, that publisheth peace; that announceth  glad tidings of good, that publisheth salvation, that saith  unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:8">52:8</a> -- The voice of thy watchmen, they lift up the voice, they  sing aloud together; for they shall see eye to eye, when  Jehovah shall bring again Zion.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:9">52:9</a> Break forth, sing aloud together, waste places of  Jerusalem; for Jehovah comforteth his people, he hath redeemed  Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:10">52:10</a> Jehovah hath made bare his holy arm in the sight of all  the nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the  salvation of our God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:11">52:11</a> -- Depart, depart, go out from thence, touch not what is  unclean; go out of the midst of her, be ye clean, that bear the  vessels of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:12">52:12</a> For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight; for  Jehovah will go before you, and the God of Israel will be your  rear-guard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:13">52:13</a> Behold, my servant shall deal prudently; he shall be  exalted and be lifted up, and be very high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:14">52:14</a> As many were astonished at thee -- his visage was so  marred more than any man, and his form more than the children  of men</p> 
 <p><a name="an_52:15">52:15</a> -- so shall he astonish many nations; kings shall shut  their mouths at him: for what had not been told them shall they  see, and what they had not heard shall they consider.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:1">53:1</a> Who hath believed our report? and to whom hath the arm of  Jehovah been revealed?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:2">53:2</a> For he shall grow up before him as a tender sapling, and as  a root out of dry ground: he hath no form nor lordliness, and  when we see him, there is no beauty that we should desire him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:3">53:3</a> He is despised and left alone of men; a man of sorrows, and  acquainted with grief, and like one from whom [men] hide their  faces; -- despised, and we esteemed him not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:4">53:4</a> Surely *he* hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows;  and we, we did regard him stricken, smitten of God, and  afflicted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:5">53:5</a> But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised  for our iniquities; the chastisement of our peace was upon him,  and with his stripes we are healed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:6">53:6</a> All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned every  one to his own way; and Jehovah hath laid upon him the iniquity  of us all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:7">53:7</a> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, but he opened not  his mouth; he was led as a lamb to the slaughter, and was as a  sheep dumb before her shearers, and he opened not his mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:8">53:8</a> He was taken from oppression and from judgment; and who  shall declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the  land of the living; for the transgression of my people was he  stricken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:9">53:9</a> And [men] appointed his grave with the wicked, but he was  with the rich in his death, because he had done no violence,  neither was there guile in his mouth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:10">53:10</a> Yet it pleased Jehovah to bruise him; he hath subjected  [him] to suffering. When thou shalt make his soul an offering  for sin, he shall see a seed, he shall prolong [his] days, and  the pleasure of Jehovah shall prosper in his hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:11">53:11</a> He shall see of [the fruit of] the travail of his soul,  [and] shall be satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous  servant instruct many in righteousness; and *he* shall bear  their iniquities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_53:12">53:12</a> Therefore will I assign him a portion with the great, and  he shall divide the spoil with the strong: because he hath  poured out his soul unto death, and was reckoned with the  transgressors; and he bore the sin of many, and made  intercession for the transgressors.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:1">54:1</a> Exult, thou barren, that didst not bear; break forth into  singing, and shout for joy, thou that didst not travail with  child: for more are the children of the desolate than the  children of the married wife, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:2">54:2</a> Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth  the curtains of thy habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords,  and strengthen thy stakes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:3">54:3</a> For thou shalt spread abroad on the right hand and on the  left; and thy seed shall possess nations, and they shall make  desolate cities to be inhabited.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:4">54:4</a> Fear not, for thou shalt not be ashamed; neither be thou  confounded, for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt  forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the  reproach of thy widowhood any more.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:5">54:5</a> For thy Maker is thy husband: Jehovah of hosts is his name,  and thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel: the God of the whole  earth shall he be called.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:6">54:6</a> For Jehovah hath called thee as a woman forsaken and  grieved in spirit, and as a wife of youth, that hath been  refused, saith thy God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:7">54:7</a> For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great  mercies will I gather thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:8">54:8</a> In the outpouring of wrath have I hid my face from thee for  a moment; but with everlasting loving-kindness will I have  mercy on thee, saith Jehovah, thy Redeemer.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:9">54:9</a> For this is [as] the waters of Noah unto me, since I have  sworn that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth:  so have I sworn that I will no more be wroth with thee, nor  rebuke thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:10">54:10</a> For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed;  but my loving-kindness shall not depart from thee, neither  shall my covenant of peace be removed, saith Jehovah, that hath  mercy on thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:11">54:11</a> [Thou] afflicted, tossed with tempest, not comforted!  Behold, I will set thy stones in antimony, and lay thy  foundations with sapphires;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:12">54:12</a> and I will make thy battlements of rubies, and thy gates  of carbuncles, and all thy borders of precious stones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:13">54:13</a> And all thy children [shall be] taught of Jehovah, and  great shall be the peace of thy children.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:14">54:14</a> In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be  far from oppression, for thou shalt not fear; and from terror,  for it shall not come near thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:15">54:15</a> Behold, they shall surely gather together, [but] not by  me: whosoever gathereth together against thee shall fall  because of thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:16">54:16</a> Behold, it is I who have created the smith that bloweth in  the fire of coal, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his  work; and I have created the destroyer to ravage.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_54:17">54:17</a> No weapon that is prepared against thee shall prosper; and  every tongue that riseth against thee in judgment, thou shalt  condemn. This is the inheritance of the servants of Jehovah;  and their righteousness is of me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:1">55:1</a> Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he  that hath no money, come ye, buy, and eat: yea, come, buy wine  and milk without money and without price!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:2">55:2</a> Wherefore do ye spend money for [that which is] not bread?  and your labour for that which satisfieth not? Hearken  diligently unto me, and eat ye [that which is] good, and let  your soul delight itself in fatness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:3">55:3</a> Incline your ear, and come unto me; hear, and your soul  shall live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you,  the sure mercies of David.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:4">55:4</a> Behold, I have given him [for] a witness to the peoples, a  prince and commander to the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:5">55:5</a> Behold, thou shalt call a nation thou knowest not, and a  nation [that] knew not thee shall run unto thee, because of  Jehovah thy God, and the Holy One of Israel; for he hath  glorified thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:6">55:6</a> Seek ye Jehovah while he may be found, call ye upon him  while he is near.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:7">55:7</a> Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his  thoughts; and let him return unto Jehovah, and he will have  mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:8">55:8</a> For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your  ways my ways, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:9">55:9</a> For [as] the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my  ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:10">55:10</a> For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and  returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it  bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and  bread to the eater:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:11">55:11</a> so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it  shall not return unto me void, but it shall do that which I  please, and it shall accomplish that for which I send it.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:12">55:12</a> For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace;  the mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into  singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_55:13">55:13</a> Instead of the thorn shall come up the cypress, and  instead of the nettle shall come up the myrtle; and it shall be  to Jehovah for a name, for an everlasting sign [that] shall not  be cut off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:1">56:1</a> Thus saith Jehovah: Keep ye judgment and do righteousness;  for my salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be  revealed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:2">56:2</a> Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that  holdeth fast to it; that keepeth the sabbath from profaning it,  and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:3">56:3</a> And let not the son of the alien, that hath joined himself  to Jehovah, speak saying, Jehovah hath entirely separated me  from his people; neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a dry  tree;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:4">56:4</a> for thus saith Jehovah: Unto the eunuchs that keep my  sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and hold fast  to my covenant,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:5">56:5</a> even unto them will I give in my house and within my walls  a place and a name better than of sons and daughters; I will  give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:6">56:6</a> Also the sons of the alien, that join themselves to  Jehovah, to minister unto him and to love the name of Jehovah,  to be his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from  profaning it, and holdeth fast to my covenant;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:7">56:7</a> even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them  joyful in my house of prayer; their burnt-offerings and their  sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar: for my house  shall be called a house of prayer for all the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:8">56:8</a> The Lord Jehovah, who gathereth the outcasts of Israel,  saith: Yet will I gather [others] to him, with those of his  that are gathered.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:9">56:9</a> All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, all ye beasts  in the forest.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:10">56:10</a> His watchmen are all of them blind, they are without  knowledge; they are all dumb dogs that cannot bark, dreaming,  lying down, loving to slumber:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:11">56:11</a> and the dogs are greedy, they know not to be satisfied,  and these are shepherds that know not how to discern: they all  turn to their own way, every one for his gain, even to the last  of them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_56:12">56:12</a> Come, [say they,] I will fetch wine, and we will fill  ourselves with strong drink; and to-morrow shall be as this  day, [and] much more abundant.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:1">57:1</a> The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart; and  merciful men are taken away, none considering that the  righteous is taken away from before the evil.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:2">57:2</a> He entereth into peace: they rest in their beds, [each one]  that hath walked in his uprightness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:3">57:3</a> But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of  the adulterer and the harlot.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:4">57:4</a> Against whom do ye sport yourselves? Against whom do ye  make a wide mouth, [and] draw out the tongue? Are ye not  children of transgression, a seed of falsehood,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:5">57:5</a> inflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree,  slaying the children in the valleys under the clefts of the  rocks?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:6">57:6</a> Among the smooth [stones] of the torrent is thy portion;  they, they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured out a  drink-offering, thou hast offered an oblation. Shall I be  comforted myself as to these things?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:7">57:7</a> Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even  thither didst thou go up to offer sacrifice.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:8">57:8</a> Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy  remembrance: for apart from me, thou hast uncovered thyself,  and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and hast made  agreement with them; thou lovedst their bed, thou sawest their  nakedness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:9">57:9</a> And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst  multiply thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers afar off,  and didst debase thyself unto Sheol.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:10">57:10</a> Thou wast wearied by the multitude of thy ways; [but] thou  saidst not, It is of no avail. Thou didst find a quickening of  thy strength; therefore thou wast not sick [of it].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:11">57:11</a> And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou  hast lied, and hast not remembered me, nor taken it to heart?  Have not I even of long time held my peace, and thou fearest me  not?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:12">57:12</a> I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; and they  shall not profit thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:13">57:13</a> When thou criest, let them that are gathered by thee  deliver thee! But a wind shall carry them all away, a breath  shall take them; but he that putteth his trust in me shall  inherit the land, and possess my holy mountain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:14">57:14</a> And it shall be said, Cast up, cast up, prepare the way,  take up the stumbling-blocks out of the way of my people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:15">57:15</a> For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth  eternity, and whose name is Holy: I dwell in the high and holy  [place], and with him that is of a contrite and humble spirit,  to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of  the contrite ones.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:16">57:16</a> For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always  wroth; for the spirit would fail before me, and the souls  [which] I have made.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:17">57:17</a> For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and  smote him; I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on  backslidingly in the way of his heart.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:18">57:18</a> I have seen his ways, and will heal him; and I will lead  him, and will restore comforts unto him and to those of his  that mourn.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:19">57:19</a> I create the fruit of the lips: peace, peace to him [that  is] afar off, and to him [that is] nigh, saith Jehovah; and I  will heal him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:20">57:20</a> But the wicked are like the troubled sea, which cannot  rest, and whose waters cast up mire and dirt.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_57:21">57:21</a> There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:1">58:1</a> Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and  declare unto my people their transgression, and to the house of  Jacob their sins.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:2">58:2</a> Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a  nation that doeth righteousness, and hath not forsaken the  ordinance of their God; they ask of me the ordinances of  righteousness, they take delight in approaching to God:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:3">58:3</a> -- Wherefore have we fasted, and thou seest not; have  afflicted our soul, and thou takest no knowledge? Behold, in  the day of your fast ye find what pleaseth [you], and exact all  your labours.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:4">58:4</a> Behold, ye have fasted for strife and debate, and to smite  with the fist of wickedness; ye do not at present fast, to  cause your voice to be heard on high.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:5">58:5</a> Is such the fast that I have chosen, a day for a man to  afflict his soul, -- that he should bow down his head as a  bulrush, and spread sackcloth and ashes [under him]? Wilt thou  call this a fast, and a day acceptable to Jehovah?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:6">58:6</a> Is not this the fast which I have chosen: to loose the  bands of wickedness, to undo the thongs of the yoke, and to  send forth free the crushed, and that ye break every yoke?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:7">58:7</a> Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou  bring to thy house the needy wanderers; when thou seest the  naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself from  thine own flesh?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:8">58:8</a> Then shall thy light break forth as the dawn, and thy  health shall spring forth speedily; and thy righteousness shall  go before thee, the glory of Jehovah shall be thy rearguard.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:9">58:9</a> Then shalt thou call, and Jehovah will answer; thou shalt  cry, and he will say, Here I am. If thou take away from the  midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger and the  unjust speech,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:10">58:10</a> and thou proffer thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the  afflicted soul: then shall thy light rise in the darkness, and  thine obscurity be as midday;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:11">58:11</a> and Jehovah will guide thee continually, and satisfy thy  soul in drought, and strengthen thy bones; and thou shalt be  like a watered garden, and like a water-spring, whose waters  deceive not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:12">58:12</a> And they [that come] of thee shall build the old waste  places: thou shalt raise up the foundations [that have  remained] from generation to generation; and thou shalt be  called, Repairer of the breaches, restorer of frequented paths.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:13">58:13</a> If thou turn back thy foot from the sabbath, [from] doing  thy pleasure on my holy day, and call the sabbath a delight,  the holy [day] of Jehovah, honourable; and thou honour him, not  doing thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor  speaking [idle] words;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_58:14">58:14</a> then shalt thou delight thyself in Jehovah, and I will  cause thee to ride on the high places of the earth, and feed  thee with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of  Jehovah hath spoken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:1">59:1</a> Behold, Jehovah's hand is not shortened that it cannot  save, neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:2">59:2</a> but your iniquities have separated between you and your  God, and your sins have hid [his] face from you, that he doth  not hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:3">59:3</a> For your hands are stained with blood, and your fingers  with iniquity; your lips speak lies, your tongue muttereth  unrighteousness:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:4">59:4</a> none calleth for justice, none pleadeth in truthfulness.  They trust in vanity, and speak falsehood; they conceive  mischief, and bring forth iniquity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:5">59:5</a> They hatch serpents' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he  that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed  breaketh out into a viper.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:6">59:6</a> Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they  cover themselves with their works; their works are works of  iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:7">59:7</a> Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed  innocent blood; their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity;  wasting and destruction are in their paths;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:8">59:8</a> the way of peace they know not, and there is no judgment in  their goings; they have made their paths crooked: whoso goeth  therein knoweth not peace.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:9">59:9</a> Therefore is justice far from us, and righteousness  overtaketh us not: we wait for light, and behold darkness; for  brightness, [but] we walk in obscurity.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:10">59:10</a> We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if  we had no eyes: we stumble at midday as in the twilight;  amongst the flourishing we are as the dead.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:11">59:11</a> We roar all like bears, and mourn grievously like doves:  we look for judgment, and there is none; for salvation, [but]  it is far from us.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:12">59:12</a> For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our  sins testify against us; for our transgressions are with us;  and our iniquities, we know them:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:13">59:13</a> in transgressing and lying against Jehovah, and departing  away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving  and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:14">59:14</a> And judgment is turned away backward, and righteousness  standeth afar off; for truth stumbleth in the street, and  uprightness cannot enter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:15">59:15</a> And truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh  himself a prey. And Jehovah saw [it], and it was evil in his  sight that there was no judgment.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:16">59:16</a> And he saw that there was no man, and he wondered that  there was no intercessor; and his arm brought him salvation,  and his righteousness, it sustained him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:17">59:17</a> And he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and a helmet  of salvation upon his head; and he put on garments of vengeance  [for] clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:18">59:18</a> According to deeds, so will he repay: fury to his  adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he will  repay recompence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:19">59:19</a> And they shall fear the name of Jehovah from the west, and  from the rising of the sun, his glory. When the adversary shall  come in like a flood, the Spirit of Jehovah will lift up a  banner against him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:20">59:20</a> And the Redeemer will come to Zion, and unto them that  turn from transgression in Jacob, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_59:21">59:21</a> And as for me, this is my covenant with them, saith  Jehovah: My spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have  put in thy mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of  the mouth of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed,  saith Jehovah, from henceforth and for ever.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:1">60:1</a> Arise, shine! for thy light is come, and the glory of  Jehovah is risen upon thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:2">60:2</a> For behold, darkness shall cover the earth, and gross  darkness the peoples; but Jehovah will arise upon thee, and his  glory shall be seen on thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:3">60:3</a> And the nations shall walk by thy light, and kings by the  brightness of thy rising.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:4">60:4</a> Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather  themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons come from  afar, and thy daughters are carried upon the side.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:5">60:5</a> Then thou shalt see, and shalt be brightened, and thy heart  shall throb, and be enlarged; for the abundance of the sea  shall be turned unto thee, the wealth of the nations shall come  unto thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:6">60:6</a> A multitude of camels shall cover thee, young camels of  Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall  bring gold and incense; and they shall publish the praises of  Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:7">60:7</a> All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered unto thee, the  rams of Nebaioth shall serve thee: they shall come up with  acceptance on mine altar, and I will beautify the house of my  magnificence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:8">60:8</a> Who are these that come flying as a cloud, and as doves to  their dove-cotes?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:9">60:9</a> For the isles shall await me, and the ships of Tarshish  first, to bring thy sons from afar, their silver and their gold  with them, unto the name of Jehovah thy God, and to the Holy  One of Israel, for he hath glorified thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:10">60:10</a> And the sons of the alien shall build up thy walls, and  their kings shall minister unto thee. For in my wrath I smote  thee, but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:11">60:11</a> And thy gates shall stand open continually: (they shall  not be shut day nor night,) that the wealth of the nations may  be brought unto thee, and that their kings may be led [to  thee].</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:12">60:12</a> For the nation and the kingdom that will not serve thee  shall perish; and those nations shall be utterly wasted.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:13">60:13</a> The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the cypress,  pine, and box-tree together, to beautify the place of my  sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:14">60:14</a> And the children of them that afflicted thee shall come  bending unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow  themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call  thee The city of Jehovah, the Zion of the Holy One of Israel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:15">60:15</a> Instead of thy being forsaken and hated, so that no one  went through [thee], I will make thee an eternal excellency, a  joy from generation to generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:16">60:16</a> And thou shalt suck the milk of the nations, and shalt  suck the breast of kings; and thou shalt know that I, Jehovah,  [am] thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the Mighty One of Jacob.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:17">60:17</a> For bronze I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring  silver, and for wood bronze, and for stones iron; and I will  make thine officers peace, and thy rulers righteousness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:18">60:18</a> Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor  destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls  Salvation, and thy gates Praise.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:19">60:19</a> The sun shall be no more thy light by day, neither for  brightness shall the moon give light unto thee; but Jehovah  shall be thine everlasting light, and thy God thy glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:20">60:20</a> Thy sun shall no more go down, neither shall thy moon  withdraw itself; for Jehovah shall be thine everlasting light,  and the days of thy mourning shall be ended.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:21">60:21</a> Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall possess  the land for ever -- the branch of my planting, the work of my  hands, that I may be glorified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_60:22">60:22</a> The little one shall become a thousand, and the smallest a  mighty nation: I, Jehovah, will hasten it in its time.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:1">61:1</a> The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon me, because Jehovah  hath anointed me to announce glad tidings unto the meek; he  hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to proclaim liberty  to the captives, and opening of the prison to them that are  bound;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:2">61:2</a> to proclaim the acceptable year of Jehovah, and the day of  vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:3">61:3</a> to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, that beauty should  be given unto them instead of ashes, the oil of joy instead of  mourning, the garment of praise instead of the spirit of  heaviness: that they might be called terebinths of  righteousness, the planting of Jehovah, that he may be  glorified.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:4">61:4</a> And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up  the former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,  the places desolate from generation to generation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:5">61:5</a> And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the  sons of the alien shall be your ploughmen and your  vinedressers.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:6">61:6</a> But as for you, ye shall be called priests of Jehovah; it  shall be said of you: Ministers of our God. Ye shall eat the  wealth of the nations, and into their glory shall ye enter.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:7">61:7</a> Instead of your shame [ye shall have] double; instead of  confusion they shall celebrate with joy their portion:  therefore in their land they shall possess the double;  everlasting joy shall be unto them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:8">61:8</a> For I, Jehovah, love judgment, I hate robbery with wrong;  and I will give their recompence in truth, and I will make an  everlasting covenant with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:9">61:9</a> And their seed shall be known among the nations, and their  offspring among the peoples: all that see them shall  acknowledge them, that they are a seed that Jehovah hath  blessed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:10">61:10</a> I will greatly rejoice in Jehovah, my soul shall be joyful  in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of  salvation, he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness,  as a bridegroom decketh himself with the priestly turban, and  as a bride adorneth herself with her jewels.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_61:11">61:11</a> For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as a garden  causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth, so the  Lord Jehovah will cause righteousness and praise to spring  forth before all the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:1">62:1</a> For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for  Jerusalem's sake I will not be still, until her righteousness  go forth as brightness, and her salvation as a torch that  burneth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:2">62:2</a> And the nations shall see thy righteousness, and all kings  thy glory; and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the  mouth of Jehovah will name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:3">62:3</a> And thou shalt be a crown of beauty in the hand of Jehovah,  and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:4">62:4</a> Thou shalt no more be termed, Forsaken; neither shall thy  land any more be termed, Desolate: but thou shalt be called, My  delight is in her, and thy land, Married; for Jehovah  delighteth in thee, and thy land shall be married.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:5">62:5</a> For [as] a young man marrieth a virgin, shall thy sons  marry thee; and with the joy of the bridegroom over the bride,  shall thy God rejoice over thee.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:6">62:6</a> I have set watchmen upon thy walls, Jerusalem; all the day  and all the night they shall never hold their peace: ye that  put Jehovah in remembrance, keep not silence,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:7">62:7</a> and give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make  Jerusalem a praise in the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:8">62:8</a> Jehovah hath sworn by his right hand and by the arm of his  strength, I will indeed no more give thy corn [to be] food for  thine enemies; and the sons of the alien shall not drink thy  new wine, for which thou hast laboured;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:9">62:9</a> for they that have garnered it shall eat it, and praise  Jehovah; and they that have gathered it shall drink it in the  courts of my holiness.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:10">62:10</a> Go through, go through the gates; prepare the way of the  people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;  lift up a banner for the peoples.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:11">62:11</a> Behold, Jehovah hath proclaimed unto the end of the earth,  Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh;  behold, his reward is with him, and his recompence before him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_62:12">62:12</a> And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of  Jehovah; and thou shalt be called, The sought out, The city not  forsaken.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:1">63:1</a> Who is this that cometh from Edom, with deep-red garments  from Bozrah, this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling  in the greatness of his strength? -- I that speak in  righteousness, mighty to save.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:2">63:2</a> -- Wherefore is redness in thine apparel, and thy garments  like him that treadeth in the winevat?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:3">63:3</a> I have trodden the winepress alone, and of the peoples not  a man was with me; and I have trodden them in mine anger, and  trampled them in my fury; and their blood is sprinkled upon my  garments, and I have stained all mine apparel.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:4">63:4</a> For the day of vengeance was in my heart, and the year of  my redeemed had come.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:5">63:5</a> And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered  that there was none to uphold: and mine own arm brought  salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:6">63:6</a> And I have trodden down the peoples in mine anger, and made  them drunk in my fury; and their blood have I brought down to  the earth.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:7">63:7</a> I will record the loving-kindnesses of Jehovah, the praises  of Jehovah, according to all that Jehovah hath bestowed upon  us, and the great goodness toward the house of Israel which he  hath bestowed upon them according to his mercies, and according  to the multitude of his loving-kindnesses.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:8">63:8</a> And he said, They are indeed my people, children that will  not lie; and he became their Saviour.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:9">63:9</a> In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the Angel of  his presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he  redeemed them; and he bore them and carried them all the days  of old.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:10">63:10</a> But they rebelled and grieved his holy Spirit: and he  turned to be their enemy; himself, he fought against them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:11">63:11</a> But he remembered the days of old, Moses [and] his people:  Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with the  shepherds of his flock? Where is he that put his holy Spirit  within him,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:12">63:12</a> his glorious arm leading them by the right hand of Moses,  dividing the waters before them, to make himself an everlasting  name,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:13">63:13</a> -- who led them through the depths, like a horse in the  wilderness, [and] they stumbled not?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:14">63:14</a> As cattle go down into the valley, the Spirit of Jehovah  gave them rest; so didst thou lead thy people, to make thyself  a glorious name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:15">63:15</a> Look down from the heavens, and behold from the habitation  of thy holiness and of thy glory! Where is thy zeal and thy  strength, the sounding of thy bowels and of thy tender mercies?  Are they restrained toward me?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:16">63:16</a> For thou art our Father, though Abraham be ignorant of us,  and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, Jehovah, art our Father;  our Redeemer, from everlasting, is thy name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:17">63:17</a> Why, O Jehovah, hast thou made us to err from thy ways,  hast hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants'  sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:18">63:18</a> Thy holy people have possessed [it] but a little while:  our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_63:19">63:19</a> We have become [like those] over whom thou never barest  rule, those not called by thy name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:1">64:1</a> Oh, that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest  come down, -- that the mountains might flow down at thy  presence,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:2">64:2</a> -- as fire kindleth brushwood, as the fire causeth water to  boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the  nations might tremble at thy presence!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:3">64:3</a> When thou didst terrible things [which] we looked not for,  thou camest down, and the mountains flowed down at thy  presence.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:4">64:4</a> Never have [men] heard, nor perceived by the ear, nor hath  eye seen a God beside thee, who acteth for him that waiteth for  him.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:5">64:5</a> Thou meetest him that rejoiceth to do righteousness, those  that remember thee in thy ways: (behold, thou wast wroth, and  we have sinned:) in those is perpetuity, and we shall be saved.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:6">64:6</a> And we are all become as an unclean [thing], and all our  righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all fade as a leaf,  and our iniquities, like the wind, have carried us away;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:7">64:7</a> and there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth  up himself to take hold of thee; for thou hast hidden thy face  from us, and hast caused us to melt away through our  iniquities.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:8">64:8</a> And now, Jehovah, thou art our Father; we are the clay, and  thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:9">64:9</a> Be not wroth very sore, O Jehovah, neither remember  iniquity for ever. Behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy  people.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:10">64:10</a> Thy holy cities are become a wilderness, Zion is a  wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:11">64:11</a> Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers  praised thee, is burnt up with fire, and all our precious  things are laid waste.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_64:12">64:12</a> Wilt thou restrain thyself in presence of these things,  Jehovah? Wilt thou hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:1">65:1</a> I am sought out of them that inquired not [for me], I am  found of them that sought me not; I have said, Behold me,  behold me, unto a nation that was not called by my name.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:2">65:2</a> I have stretched out my hands all the day unto a rebellious  people, who walk in a way not good, after their own thoughts;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:3">65:3</a> the people that provoke me to anger continually to my face,  sacrificing in gardens and burning incense upon the bricks;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:4">65:4</a> who sit down among the graves, and lodge in the secret  places; who eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things  [is in] their vessels;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:5">65:5</a> who say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am  holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that  burneth all the day.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:6">65:6</a> Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence,  but will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:7">65:7</a> your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers  together, saith Jehovah, who have burned incense upon the  mountains, and outraged me upon the hills; and I will measure  their former work into their bosom.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:8">65:8</a> Thus saith Jehovah: As the new wine is found in the  cluster, and it is said, Destroy it not, for a blessing is in  it; so will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy  [them] all.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:9">65:9</a> And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of  Judah a possessor of my mountains; and mine elect shall possess  it, and my servants shall dwell there.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:10">65:10</a> And the Sharon shall be a fold for flocks, and the valley  of Achor a couching-place of the herds, for my people that have  sought me.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:11">65:11</a> But ye who forsake Jehovah, who forget my holy mountain,  who prepare a table for Gad, and fill up mixed wine unto Meni:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:12">65:12</a> I will even assign you to the sword, and ye shall all bow  down in the slaughter; because I called, and ye did not answer,  I spoke, and ye did not hear; but ye did what was evil in mine  eyes, and chose that wherein I delight not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:13">65:13</a> Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah: Behold, my servants  shall eat, and *ye* shall be hungry; behold, my servants shall  drink, and *ye* shall be thirsty; behold, my servants shall  rejoice, and *ye* shall be ashamed;</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:14">65:14</a> behold, my servants shall sing aloud for gladness of  heart, and *ye* shall cry out for sorrow of heart, and shall  howl for vexation of spirit.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:15">65:15</a> And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto mine elect;  for the Lord Jehovah will slay thee, and will call his servants  by another name:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:16">65:16</a> so that he who blesseth himself in the land shall bless  himself by the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the land  shall swear by the God of truth: because the former troubles  shall be forgotten, and because they shall be hidden from mine  eyes.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:17">65:17</a> For behold, I create new heavens and a new earth; and the  former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:18">65:18</a> But be glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create.  For behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a  joy.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:19">65:19</a> And I will rejoice over Jerusalem, and will joy in my  people; and the voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her,  nor the voice of crying.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:20">65:20</a> There shall be no more thenceforth an infant of days, nor  an old man that hath not completed his days; for the youth  shall die a hundred years old, and the sinner being a hundred  years old shall be accursed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:21">65:21</a> And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they  shall plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:22">65:22</a> they shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not  plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree shall be the  days of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of  their hands.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:23">65:23</a> They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for terror;  for they are the seed of the blessed of Jehovah, and their  offspring with them.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:24">65:24</a> And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will  answer; while they are yet speaking, I will hear.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_65:25">65:25</a> The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion  shall eat straw like the ox; and dust shall be the serpent's  meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,  saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:1">66:1</a> Thus saith Jehovah: The heavens are my throne, and the  earth is my footstool: what is the house that ye will build  unto me? and what is the place of my rest?</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:2">66:2</a> Even all these things hath my hand made, and all these  things have been, saith Jehovah. But to this man will I look:  to the afflicted and contrite in spirit, and who trembleth at  my word.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:3">66:3</a> He that slaughtereth an ox, smiteth a man; he that  sacrificeth a lamb, breaketh a dog's neck; he that offereth an  oblation, [it is as] swine's blood; he that presenteth a  memorial of incense, [is as] he that blesseth an idol. As they  have chosen their own ways, and their soul delighteth in their  abominations,</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:4">66:4</a> I also will choose their calamities, and will bring their  fears upon them; because I called, and none answered, I spoke,  and they did not hear, but did that which was evil in mine  eyes, and chose that wherein I delight not.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:5">66:5</a> Hear the word of Jehovah, ye that tremble at his word: Your  brethren that hated you, that cast you out for my name's sake,  said, Let Jehovah be glorified, and let us see your joy! but  they shall be ashamed.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:6">66:6</a> A voice of tumult from the city, a voice from the temple, a  voice of Jehovah that rendereth recompence to his enemies!</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:7">66:7</a> Before she travailed, she brought forth; before her pain  came, she was delivered of a man-child.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:8">66:8</a> Who hath heard such a thing? who hath seen such things? Can  a land be made to bring forth in one day? shall a nation be  born at once? For as soon as Zion travailed, she brought forth  her sons.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:9">66:9</a> Shall I bring to the birth, and not cause to bring forth?  saith Jehovah; I who cause to bring forth, shall I shut [the  womb]? saith thy God.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:10">66:10</a> Rejoice with Jerusalem, and be glad for her, all ye that  love her; rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn over her:</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:11">66:11</a> because ye shall suck, and be satisfied with the breasts  of her consolations; because ye shall drink out, and be  delighted with the abundance of her glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:12">66:12</a> For thus saith Jehovah: Behold, I will extend peace to her  like a river, and the glory of the nations like an overflowing  torrent; and ye shall suck, ye shall be carried upon the side,  and be dandled upon the knees.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:13">66:13</a> As one whom his mother comforteth, so will I comfort you;  and ye shall be comforted in Jerusalem.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:14">66:14</a> And ye shall see [this], and your heart shall rejoice, and  your bones shall flourish like the grass; and the hand of  Jehovah shall be known toward his servants, and he will have  indignation toward his enemies.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:15">66:15</a> For behold, Jehovah will come with fire, and his chariots  like a whirlwind, to render his anger with fury, and his rebuke  with flames of fire.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:16">66:16</a> For by fire and by his sword will Jehovah enter into  judgment with all flesh: and the slain of Jehovah shall be  many.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:17">66:17</a> They that sanctify themselves, and purify themselves in  the gardens behind one in the midst; that eat swine's flesh,  and the abomination, and the mouse, shall perish together,  saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:18">66:18</a> And I, -- their works and their thoughts [are before me].  ... [The time] cometh for the gathering of all nations and  tongues; and they shall come, and see my glory.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:19">66:19</a> And I will set a sign among them, and I will send those  that escape of them unto the nations, to Tarshish, Pul, and  Lud, that draw the bow; to Tubal and Javan, to the isles afar  off, that have not heard my fame, neither have seen my glory:  and they shall declare my glory among the nations.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:20">66:20</a> And they shall bring all your brethren out of all the  nations as an oblation unto Jehovah, upon horses, and in  chariots, and in covered waggons, and upon mules, and upon  dromedaries, to my holy mountain, to Jerusalem, saith Jehovah,  as the children of Israel bring an oblation in a clean vessel  into the house of Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:21">66:21</a> And I will also take of them for priests [and] for  Levites, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:22">66:22</a> For as the new heavens and the new earth which I will make  shall remain before me, saith Jehovah, so shall your seed and  your name remain.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:23">66:23</a> And it shall come to pass from new moon to new moon, and  from sabbath to sabbath, all flesh shall come to worship before  me, saith Jehovah.</p> 
 <p><a name="an_66:24">66:24</a> And they shall go forth, and look upon the carcases of the  men that have transgressed against me: for their worm shall not  die, neither shall their fire be quenched; and they shall be an  abhorrence unto all flesh.</p>
