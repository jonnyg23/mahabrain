 <h1 align="CENTER">RELIGIONS</h1>
 <p>Mu's RELIGION.--It is fairly well established that all religions have a common origin. Let us see what that source was.</p>
 <p>The first records of religion are more than 70,000 years old. They tell us that a body of trained masters from Mu, called Naacals, were carrying to her various colonies and colonial empires copies of the Motherland's Sacred Inspired Religion. These Naacals formed in each country colleges for the teaching of the priestcraft religion, and the sciences. The priesthoods that were formed in these colleges in turn taught the people. There is a very interesting ancient writing about the Chaldis, as the colleges were called in Babylonia. It says: "Everyone was welcome, be he prince or slave. Directly they passed into the temple, they were equal, for they stood in the presence of the Heavenly Father, the Father of them all, and here they became brothers in fact. No payment was charged; all was free."</p>
 <p>Throughout the colonies and colonial empires these teachings were known as the Sacred Mysteries, a name that has persisted down to the present. In the <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_28"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 28</font></a></p>
 <p>Orient they were also called the Books of the Golden Age. In later times, I find among Maya and Egyptian writings that the Sacred Mysteries were only entrusted to the high priesthood and the heir apparent to the throne.</p>
 <p>Clement of Alexandria wrote: "The Sacred Mysteries are only entrusted to high priests and the heir apparent to the throne." This I find was not exactly true. Many of the Greek Philosophers who went to Egypt were entrusted with the Sacred Mysteries, among them being Solon, Plato, Pythagoras and Thales.</p>
 <p>From various Naacal writings, sometimes called Neferit, and translations of the Sacred Inspired Writings, I shall try to outline the First Religion and show how it was taught to primitive man.</p>
 <p>Religion started at a very early period in man's history; evidently when he could not understand anything that was abstrusely expressed. Apparently it was found necessary for explanation to use object lessons, symbols, where sight would supply the absence of words. I find the earliest symbols were of an elementary character, plain lines and simple geometrical figures. I refer to a date prior to 70,000 years ago, for according to the records man was so far advanced at that time that he was mastering the most intricate vignettes, tableaux, et cetera, which today puzzle our great scientists.</p>
 <p>Evidently religion was originally taught in stages.</p>
 <i></i><p>First: Man was taught that there was a Supreme <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_29"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 29</font></a></p>
 <p>Being, Infinite and All Powerful. That it was the Creator who created all things above and below. That man was created by this Almighty Being and having been created by Him, was his son-that this Almighty was man's Heavenly Father.</p>
 <i></i><p>Second: When man was created the Creator placed within the body of man a spirit or soul which never died but continued on through eternity.</p>
 <i></i><p>Third: When man was created it was ordained that his material body should return to the earth from which it was taken. When this material body died it released the soul which went into the world beyond, there to wait until it was called upon to occupy another material body.</p>
 <p>Apparently, as soon as his primitive mind could grasp the facts, he was taught that his soul was given a task. This task was for the soul to rule the material body by overcoming material desires. When this was accomplished his soul would be called back to the Great Source, and forever afterwards live in perfect joy and happiness.</p>
 <p>He was taught that one material life was so short that the soul could not overcome all of the material desires, so it was ordained that his soul should come into many bodies until the task was accomplished; that these reincarnations were the salvation of his soul.</p>
 <i></i><p>Fourth: It was thoroughly instilled into his mind that the Heavenly Father was <i>The Great Love</i> and that this great love ruled the Universe and never died. <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_30"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 30</font></a></p>
 <p>He was taught that the love of the Heavenly Father was far greater than the love of his earthly father, who was only a reflection of his Heavenly Father. Therefore he should always approach his Heavenly Father without fear or dread and in perfect confidence and love, knowing that loving hands were being held out to receive him when he came.</p>
 <i></i><p>Fifth: He was taught that all mankind were created by the same Heavenly Father; therefore all mankind were his brothers and sisters, and should be treated as such in all his dealings with them.</p>
 <i></i><p>Sixth: Finally he was taught his duties on earth, how he should live to prepare himself to become fit to pass into the world beyond when he was called. He was especially reminded that he must follow the paths of Truth, Love, Charity, Chastity, with perfect love and confidence in his Heavenly Father.</p>
 <p>From this short and inadequate sketch it is shown that the fundamental principles of the first religion of man were: <i>The Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man</i>.</p>
 <p>Judging from the various religious teachings of the Sacred Inspired Writings, the phrase "Brotherhood of Man" is not meant to convey the idea that all men are to, look upon each other as blood brothers. It would seem to me that this phrasing is symbolical or used as an example for explanation. I think our modern example better explains the meaning to the mind of present man, namely, "Do unto others as you would have them</p>
 <p><a name="page_31"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 31</font></a></p>
 <p>do unto you." This seems to be confirmed by the forty-two questions in the Osirian Ritual. If we all followed this "Golden Rule" no discord could arise among mankind and the world would be in a virtual bond of brotherhood.</p>
 <p>Again, I think the meaning of the word "charity" is not fully comprehended today. It refers to the soul rather than to the material part of man. Not only material charitable actions, such as feeding the hungry and clothing the naked, but it includes good and charitable thoughts of others. We should think ill of no one but try to help them overcome their failings. The great Master, Jesus, gave us an example of this.</p>
 <p>SYMBOLS.--Throughout his teachings early man was constantly reminded that no symbol, however sacred, was to be worshipped in any way; that symbols were used only to enable him to concentrate his mind solely on the Deity and the particular subject of his supplication. By keeping his eyes on the symbol, other objects were excluded from his vision.</p>
 <p>Symbols in our churches would not be amiss today, at least in some cases. On one occasion my seat in church was directly behind the pew of a wealthy broker. Every time the congregation knelt in prayer this pillar of the church, for he was one of them, drew from the shelf a book bound as a prayer book. When he opened it I saw that it was a ledger with rows of figures in debit and credit columns. These he went up and down with his finger, all the time mumbling something so that</p>
 <p><a name="page_32"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 32</font></a></p>
 <p>those around him thought he was earnest in prayer. Were his thoughts of God? The symbol he was using guided him to the material-not the spiritual.</p>
 <p>THEOLOGY.--The religion of Mu had no theologies or dogmas. Everything was taught in the simplest, most comprehensive language, a language that even the most unschooled mind could grasp.</p>
 <p>Theologies and dogmas crept into religion after the submergence of the Motherland. With her destruction, her controlling influences were gone. Confusions in religion then began, and exist in full force today. Anyone considering present-day religion can see that it is in the process of crumbling, that it is only a question of time when it will be a mass of ruins. Then, when these ruins are cleared away, there will arise a new and purer conception of spiritual things. Religion cannot die until man has attained the perfection ordained for him.</p>
 <p>Our present religious state is not a new condition. Twice before, religion has fallen to the ground through theologies and their consequences. Out of the ashes new religions have arisen. Out of the ashes of present religions a new one will also arise. "He whom the gods destroy they first make mad." Madness in the form of bigotry, impossible theologies, and other errors exists today.</p>
 <p>WHY PAST RELIGIONS HAVE FALLEN.--At various times in the history of man unscrupulous priesthoods have caused the downfall of religion by introducing into it vicious systems of theology made up of inventions,</p>
 <p><a name="page_33"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 33</font></a></p>
 <p>extravagances and immorality; omissions and false and vicious translations from the Sacred Inspired Religion of Mu from which all religions have sprung.</p>
 <p>These systems were invented by priesthoods for the purpose of inspiring superstitious fears in the hearts of the people, to ensnare them, body and soul, into slavery to the priesthood. Having accomplished this, it did not take long for these priesthoods to acquire wealth and become all powerful. This was vividly illustrated in Egypt, where the Priests of Ammon not only gained the riches of the country but seized the throne as well. When, however, they started to control the military, the soldiers revolted and at the point of the spear drove them down into Ethopia, where they were prevented from returning to Egypt. The accumulation and concentration of wealth invariably ruins a country. There are at least a dozen historical records of it.</p>
 <p>The first great outrage to religion I have found historically recorded occurred in Atlantis 22,000 years ago. It is referred to as "extravagances in the priestly teachings." The great master, Osiris, dispelled these extravagances and reinstated the original religion of the Fatherhood of God and Brotherhood of Man. As a monument to the memory of this great master, Religion was named after him.</p>
 <p>THE OSIRIAN RELIGION.--When Thoth of Atlantis founded the colony on the Nile Delta, Egypt's history began. Thoth built the first temple at Saïs and there taught Religion as purged by Osiris 6,000 years before.</p>
 <p><a name="page_34"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 34</font></a></p>
 <p>At the destruction of Mu, Ra Mu, the King and High Priest of the Motherland, addressed the pleading crowds, saying:</p>
 <p>"You shall all die together, you and your servants and your riches. From your ashes new nations shall arise and if they forget they are superior, not because of what they put on but what they put out, the same will befall them."</p>
 <p>The foregoing indicates that the people had strayed from the teachings of the church, become materialistic and forgotten God, not that they had been led astray by the priests. It would appear that they were dropping the spiritual for the material: they were amassing riches and forgetting God. This would seem to be corroborated in a previous statement, where Ra Mu is quoted as saying:</p>
 <p>"Did I not predict all this?"</p>
 <p>It was the priesthood of Egypt that caused the cataclysmic wave of false gods, idolatry and spiritual <a href="errata.htm#0">degradation</a> to sweep over the land. So well did they effect their nefarious designs that priestly orders throughout the world were drawn into the vortex contributing to religion's spiritual downfall. This started over 5,000 years ago, and the prostituted Osirian religion has now long passed into the discard. Many of its extravagances have, however, persisted down to present times and are found embodied in our religious conceptions.</p>
 <p>The Egyptians were the first to teach the worship of symbols, a thing strictly forbidden in the Ancient Religion. <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_35"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 35</font></a></p>
 <p>Thus began idolatry. The next step was the invention of a devil whom they called Set. For this malevolent being they imagined a domain which they called Hell.</p>
 <p>The extravagances of their description of this domain had no bounds, and one wonders how any sane person could have accepted them. According to these teachings, it was a place of everlasting flames, of burning brimstone that never died. Cast into these sulphurous flames, the Soul remained scorching for all eternity.</p>
 <p>The soul of man is a spirit. No element can touch or come in contact with a spirit. Sulphur is an element. Therefore, it cannot come in contact with a spirit, for a spirit is negative to all elementary matter. Even if it were not, the forces of the spirit are so much higher than those of heat that the spirit could repel it.</p>
 <p>I shall next show how the devil himself managed to put in an appearance. The claim was made that the devil was an archangel, fallen from the ways of grace, and cast from heaven into hell. The four archangels are only another vestment for the Four Great Primary Forces, or as Max Müller calls it, "a new disguise." As the Great Primary Forces still exist, working and controlling the Universe as of old, it is clear that none have fallen, as the story of Lucifer would have us believe.</p>
 <p>It was thus the Egyptian priesthood dragged the beautiful, pure Osirian Religion into the mud, the religion with which Egypt commenced her history 10,000 years before, causing the nation itself to fall and become</p>
 <p><a name="page_36"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 36</font></a></p>
 <p>the slave of foreign conquerors. Before the Egyptian invention, a devil was unknown. Man had been taught there were two influences attending him here on earth--a material influence emanating from his earthly body, and a spiritual influence that came from his soul. His spiritual influence had the power to overcome the material, and it was his destiny that it should eventually dominate. It might, however, take many incarnations before this was accomplished, after which his soul would return to the Great Source.</p>
 <p>Hindu priests, always quick to adopt anything of material advantage to themselves, followed Egypt in the debauchery of religion. An obstacle that had first to be overcome, however, was their Naacal teachers. These were unwavering in their adherence to the teachings of the First Religion. So the Brahminical priests started to persecute the Naacals, eventually driving them into the snow-capped mountains of the North. When these holy men were disposed of, the debauch commenced.</p>
 <p>Not wishing to borrow their devil from the Egyptians, the Brahmin priests invented one of their own and called him Siva (pronounced Sheva).</p>
 <p>From the time Siva was grafted into the Hindu religion, history shows that the Hindus fell from the high pinnacle of civilization which had been theirs since the period of the Motherland. A little history will verify this assertion:</p>
 <i></i><p>Universal History and M. D. Voltaire--A. D. 1758. Vol. 3, Page 13.</p>
 <p><a name="page_37"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 37</font></a></p>
 <p>"The school of the ancient gynosophists was still subsisting in the great city of Benares on the banks of the Ganges. There the Brahmins cultivated the <i>Sacred Language</i> which they called <i>Hanferit</i>, and look upon it as the most ancient of all languages. [The Naacal writings are in what is here called Hanferit.]</p>
 <p>"They admit of Genii, like the primitive Persians. They <i>tell</i> their <i>disciples</i> that symbols are made only to fix the attention of the people and are different <i>emblems</i> of the Deity. But as this sound theology <i>would turn to no profit</i>, they concealed it from the people. [And taught what produced superstitious awe and fear.]</p>
 <p>"Be that as it may, the <i>Indians were no longer</i> that people of <i>superior knowledge</i> into whose country the <i>ancient Greeks used to travel for instruction</i>."</p>
 <p>India was the cradle of the Greek Philosophy. Up to 500 B. C. the Greeks were going to India for learning. When they commenced going I do not know--possibly a thousand years before.</p>
 <i></i><p>W. Robertson, "An Historical Disquisition of India," Pub. 1794, Page 274.</p>
 <p>"The Brahmins, it is well known, <i>borrowed</i> religion, <i>as well as all other sciences</i> of civilization, <i>from the highly civilized Nagas</i>, whom afterwards they <i>relentlessly persecuted</i>."</p>
 <p>One of the inventions of the Hindu priests was that Man was first created a grass, then a fish, passed into an amphibian, then a reptile, from a reptile into a mammal, and from this became a man. They also maintained</p>
 <p><a name="page_38"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 38</font></a></p>
 <p>that everything is a part of God and that all things put together are God. And yet this same priesthood says that idolatry is a sin. Let us analyze this.</p>
 <p>Idolatry is a sin. The worship of idols made of wood and stone is idolatry. The worship of God is not idolatry. As the wood and stone are parts of God, the worship of wood and stone would be worshipping parts of God: therefore there is no such thing as idolatry, since whatever is worshipped is a part of God. What can be more fantastic than this? Yet I find the same conception in one of our religious sects today, and they call themselves Christians. Did Jesus ever utter such inconceivable nonsense?</p>
 <p>The Brahminical priests did their work well, for they enslaved the people and froze their brains. But India is today awakening. She is casting off her priestly shackles and has started to regain her enviable place among nations, to regain her old religion and civilization. And she will again stand in the proud position from which she was dragged down. The Untouchables will no longer be Untouchables, but will receive their place as brothers in the land. But the Hindus must remember that they are <i>only emerging</i>, the top of the Cross is not clear of the water.</p>
 <p>Some few thousand years ago the Priesthoods generally put the coping stone of horrors on religion--they instituted the horrible practice of human sacrifice. This addition caused consternation and enhanced the fear of the people in all lands. No one knew but he might be</p>
 <p><a name="page_39"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 39</font></a></p>
 <p>the next to be stretched upon the bloody stone, or, be shrouded in the flames of the fiery furnace. Fear and dread reigned supreme. These human sacrifices have supposedly disappeared from what is termed "civilized peoples." But have they? Is not human life sacrificed today under another guise? And what about present-day religions and people? The only difference from now and 3,000 years ago is a thicker veneer over our savagery.</p>
 <p>The Church of Rome has a bloody page disfiguring its record by the Inquisition.</p>
 <p>The Protestant Church has a great blot on her escutcheon with the burning of witches.</p>
 <p>The Mohammedan Church was born with the sword, has lived by the sword, and will die by the sword--blood covers every page of its history.</p>
 <p>Have Christians been following the teachings of the Great Master, Jesus, who preached only kindness and brotherly love? Certainly not! They have been following the cruel lust for blood bred of fanaticism and bigotry. Are we, ourselves, any better today? I think not. Our lust for blood causes us to hang, shoot and electrocute in the name of the law. What law? Not God's, for His law says, "<i>Thou shalt not kill</i>." With all our great professions of civilization we still remain savages at heart, and I have known many savages who are more truly civilized than we are. We erect towering buildings, make horrible wars on one another because of greed for power and wealth. Is this civilization, or mere</p>
 <p><a name="page_40"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 40</font></a></p>
 <p>display? Coat a pig with gold and the pig still remains a pig. The gold is only a veneer; the pig still exists in its original form. Our civilization is simply a veneer hiding our real selves--neither our hearts nor characters are affected by it for we are what we are.</p>
 <p>I shall now show by Mu's Cosmogonic Diagram what the First Religion of Man was--the Sacred Inspired Religion of Mu.</p>
 <p>MU'S COSMOGONIC DIAGRAM.--The Cosmogonic Diagram of Mu was the mother of all the various cosmogonic diagrams found throughout the world. All subsequent diagrams were based on that of the Motherland.</p>
 <p>Inventions, alterations, additions in lines to adapt them to new meanings, made nightmares of them all.</p>
 <p>One of the most prominent additions in the Hindu, Babylonian, Assyrian, Chaldean and Egyptian was the addition of a hell. This hell is shown in various diagrams as a small circle below the main figure, the outside of the circle symbolizing the Universe, which was putting it far away from the earth. As the devil was unknown in Mu, no hell appears in her cosmogonic diagram.</p>
 <p>DECIPHERING MU'S DIAGRAM.--In Mu the novice was taught to learn the diagram thoroughly and repeat what was written upon it as his spiritual convictions. just as children are taught the Bible today, the children of lost Mu were instructed in this diagram.</p>
 <p>THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE DIAGRAM.--In the center</p>

 <p>is a circle within two crossed and interwoven triangles. Being interwoven or interlaced, these triangles form but one figure.</p>
 <p>These two triangles are enclosed within a second circle, thus leaving twelve divisions.</p>
 <p>Beyond this circle is a third, leaving a space between the two.</p>
 <p>On the outside of this third circle are 12 scallops. Falling from the outside of the scallops is a ribbon which has 8 divisions.</p>
 <p>THE MEANINGS OF THESE FIGURES.--The central circle is a picture of the Sun and the symbol of the Deity whose abode is Heaven.</p>
 <p>The twelve divisions, formed by the crossing of the two triangles, are the gates to Heaven where dwells the Heavenly Father. These gates symbolize virtues, the twelve great earthly virtues, which man must possess before he can enter the gates, among them being Love, Hope, Charity, Chastity, Faith, et cetera. Love stands at the head of the list.</p>
 <p>The space between the second and third circles is the world beyond, which the soul must pass through to reach the gates of Heaven.</p>
 <p>The twelve scallops on the outside of the outer circle are the gates to the world beyond and symbolize the twelve great earthly temptations which must be overcome by the material body, before the soul can pass through these gates to the world beyond.</p>
 <p>The ribbon with the eight divisions symbolizes the</p>

 <p> </p>
 <p><a name="page_44"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 44</font></a></p>
 <p>eight roads to Heaven and tells what man's actions and thoughts must be to ascend to the gates of the world beyond. Put into present language the foregoing would read:</p>
 <p>THE BELIEF.--I believe there are eight roads to travel to reach Heaven (mentioning them). My soul will first arrive after travelling these roads at the gates to the world beyond. To enter these my soul must show that my earthly body overcame the twelve great earthly temptations (mentioning them). Having shown that it had done so, my soul will be allowed to Pass into the world beyond. This I must traverse until I reach the gates of Heaven. Here my soul must prove that my earthly body possessed the twelve great virtues (mentioning them). Having shown that it did, my soul will then be passed through the gates into Heaven to the Throne of Glory, where sits the Heavenly Father waiting to receive it.</p>
 <p>Have we anything today in any of our religions and religious sects that will compare with this beautiful conception so simply worded?</p>
 <p>This was the Religion of Mu, the Motherland, and the First Religion of Man.</p>
 <p>JESUS AND THE CHRISTIAN RELIGION.--Jesus was a Master, the greatest and most proficient who has ever been on earth.</p>
 <p>Jesus did not teach a new religion; he simply taught the First Original Religion as it is written in the Sacred and Inspired Writings of Mu.</p>

 <p>The Lord's Prayer, the greatest work of its kind ever penned or spoken, is to be found in the Sacred Writings of Mu. Jesus condensed the ancient text to suit the language of his day. He compacted the whole of the material parts of religion into a few short sentences, leaving out nothing that was vital to man's salvation. The religion taught by Jesus has been called the Christian Religion, yet not five per cent of those who profess to follow His teachings do so; the other ninety-five per cent are following the supposed teachings of the apostles made up by a conclave of priests years after Jesus and his apostles had taken the long journey. This they called the Athenasian Creed. They borrowed the name Christian for their headline.</p>
 <p>The teachings of this religion today include some of the extravagances the priesthood of Egypt grafted into the Osirian Religion, which are so contrary to actual teachings of Jesus they are deplorable. Theologies and bigotry, to which may be added supreme obstinacy, are tolling the death knell of the Christian religion. The priesthoods of this religion condemn the falling away of the world from the churches. This is easily understood by anyone who will trouble to think. But thinking priesthoods seem never to have existed. While they are bitterly complaining of this "falling away from the church," as they call it, the priesthood has only itself to blame. The public is receiving a higher education than heretofore. People are beginning to think for themselves.<font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p>Thinking shows them the impossible theories and beliefs that are being handed out to them, and the bigotry attending it all. With higher education their reasoning powers will not allow them to accept it, so they simply keep away from it.</p>
 <p>Are people becoming irreligious? No! On the contrary, they are becoming more religious. The heart craves truth, a knowledge of the Loving Heavenly Father. Offer people a plain, untrammelled service of simplicity and truth and no church will be big enough to hold all those who will attend.</p>
 <p>There is, however, a crisis in the Church today. How long before the structure will fall? It is crumbling fast and soon will form a heap of ruins on the ground.</p>
 <p>With the atmosphere cleared, the Original Religion will return--the religion that places the spiritual above the material, that teaches the Love of the Heavenly Father, and makes a true brotherhood of man, as it did during the life of the Motherland.</p>
 <p>I have stated that we still retain in our present religions some of the inventions and extravagances grafted into religion by the unscrupulous priesthood. They still persist, they have never been cleansed from our present day religions. I shall mention some; to mention all would fill volumes.</p>
 <p>THE DEVIL AND HELL.--The origin and date already given.</p>
 <p>VIRGIN BIRTH.--The origin of this is to be found in</p>
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 49</font></a></p>
 <p>the Sacred Writings of Mu. It appears in the Fifth Command of The Creation:</p>
 <p>"From these cosmic eggs life came forth as commanded."</p>
 <p>In a subsequent table explaining the commands in creation, cosmic eggs are referred to as "the virgins of Life." The sentence reads: "Hol Hu Kal." Translated into English it reads: Hol--closed; Hu--virgin womb; and Kal--to open. Free reading: To pierce or open the virgin womb; and, by permissible extension: To pierce or open the virgin womb of life.</p>
 <p>For this reason the ancients called the waters "the mother of life"; for up to this period of the earth's history, no life had appeared. Life, therefore, first appeared in the waters. The advent of life had opened the virgin womb in the waters.</p>
 <p>Later, The Four Great Creative Forces which emanate from the Deity had the additional name of Gods bestowed upon them.</p>
 <p>Being the <i>First Known</i> commands or executors of the commands of the Creator, they were called of virgin birth to correspond with the teachings of the Sacred Writings regarding earthly life--thus the <i>First</i> life either of the Gods or nature was the result of Hol Hu Kal.</p>
 <p>Upon this ancient conception modern priesthoods (within the last two thousand years) have invented virgin births and immaculate conceptions for various men</p>
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 50</font></a></p>
 <p>that have lived, as an example, Masters. The Priesthoods have made the Great Master, Jesus, of virgin birth and, forgetting themselves, give his pedigree and family tree back to David.</p>
 <p>Our learned scholars are not to be surpassed by any priesthoods. They tell us that all ancient Kings were of virgin birth because they were "Sons of the Sun." These Kings claimed nothing of the kind. "Son of the Sun" was a title bestowed on the rulers or emperors of a colonial empire by Mu, the Empire of the Sun and Suzerain of the whole world.</p>
 <p>Heretofore I have stated that Jesus did not teach a new faith but the Original Religion of Man.</p>
 <p>My old friend, the Rishi, never tired of talking of the Great Master, Jesus. One day he said to me: "The Lord's Prayer, as the Christians call it, is the greatest masterpiece of phraseology and condensation ever written, for it embodies the whole of the ancient religion in a few short paragraphs. Take, for instance, the beginning, 'Our Father which art in Heaven.' In these six words many points in the ancient religion are covered. It first tells us that we are His children; therefore all mankind are brothers and sisters. "Forgive us our trespasses as we forgive others that trespass against us." These simple words tell us our duty one to the other, and that we should love one another like brothers and sisters. Again 'Our Father' tells us that we should approach Him as we would our earthly father, with love and confidence. "Give us this day our daily bread" is another</p>
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 51</font></a></p>
 <p>wonderful sentence and far-reaching. It tells us that we should avoid greed and the craving to amass wealth and depend on Him for our daily needs. He will care for us, thus leaving us free to amass spiritual wealth without anxiety about the material.</p>
 <p>"You will notice, my son, our temple has no wealth nor have those connected with it any wealth. We depend entirely on what the Heavenly Father sends us day by day through the people. Our faith in Him is implicit, so he never allows us to want." And so he could go on through every sentence of the Lord's Prayer.</p>
 <p>Another favorite sentence in the Lord's Prayer to comment on was: "<i>Lead us not into temptation</i>." This, he said, "was unquestionably a mistranslation of the Master's words and, no doubt, was unintentional, arising from careless reading." He then went on: "Let us reason it out. In one of the paragraphs it is shown that the Heavenly Father is the <i>All Powerful</i>, for it says: 'For Thine is the Kingdom, the <i>Power</i> and the Glory.' Here it is shown that the supposed leader into temptation is the All Powerful. Therefore, being All Powerful, He cannot fail; and who is the All Powerful? Our kindly Heavenly Father whose love is so great it rules the universe. Could He forget His great love and set a trap for a son's downfall? Impossible!</p>
 <p>"I think the words of the Master, correctly translated, would be: '<i>Let</i> us not be led into temptation'; for in the Sacred Writings we find: 'O Heavenly Father, let not temptation overtake or surround us. If it</p>
 <p><a name="page_52"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 52</font></a></p>
 <p>does, deliver us from it.' These are the reasons why I feel that the words of the Great Master have been unintentionally misquoted or mistranslated."</p>
 <p>He told me that one of the cardinal themes of the Great Master, Jesus, was re-incarnation, something almost entirely omitted in our Biblical account of Him, also in our religious services.</p>
 <p>He told me many legends about Jesus that permeated Oriental lore, one of which he said was universal and told everywhere. The scene is laid in Lahore where Jesus was staying with one, Ajainin, who was one of Jesus' pupils.</p>
 <p>One day Jesus and Ajainin were sitting in the porch of the temple and while sitting there a band of wandering minstrels entered the court and began to play. Their music was very rich and delicate, and Jesus remarked:</p>
 <p>"Among the highest of the land we have no sweeter music than that which these uncouth children of the jungles bring to us."</p>
 <p>Ajainin asked: "Whence do they get this talent? In one short life they surely could not acquire such perfection of voice and such knowledge of harmony and time."</p>
 <p>Jesus answered: "Men call them prodigies. They are no prodigies; all things result from natural laws. These people are not young; a thousand years would not suffice to give them such divine expressions and such purity of voice. Ten thousand years ago these people had mastered harmony. In days of old they trod the busy</p>
 <p><a name="page_53"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 53</font></a></p>
 <p>thoroughfares of life and caught the melody of the voices of nature. They have come again to learn still other lessons from the varied notes of nature."</p>
 <p>When walking one evening with the Rishi, talking on the subject of the many religions of today and the work of Christian missionaries, he related a tale that was popular among the native priesthood about a poor benighted Hindu and a Christian missionary.</p>
 <p>"A missionary asked one of his native flock what he thought of religion having so many sects? The poor Hindu answered: Religions are like the fingers on the hand. How are we to tell which is right? There was once a dispute among the fingers of the hand as to which was entitled to preëminence.</p>
 <p>"The thumb said, I ought to have the preëminence for it is plain none of you can do anything without me.</p>
 <p>"Ah I said the first finger, What is more important than pointing out the way? This is my office. I ought to have the preëminence.</p>
 <p>"I, said the second finger, rest my claims on mathematical principles. When you hold the hand upright which finger is the tallest? I am; therefore I ought to have the preëminence.</p>
 <p>"No, said the third finger, for although it is something to point out the way, and mathematics are strong, there is one thing stronger, and that is love. When you put the symbol of love upon the hand, it is on the third finger. Therefore the supremacy is mine.</p>
 <p>"Hear me, too, said the little finger, it is true I</p>
 <p><a name="page_54"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 54</font></a></p>
 <p>am small and you are large. Mathematics are strong and love is stronger. But there is one thing above all these and that is worship. When you approach God, I am the finger you choose to present nearest in your prayers. For then you press your hands together, lift them up and hold them thus. Therefore, I should have the preëminence."</p>
 <p>And the old Rishi turned to me with a smile, saying: "What is your comment, my son?" The poor, benighted Hindu's philosophy nonplussed me. So I leave it to my readers to supply it.</p>
 <p>On one occasion the old Rishi informed me that temple legends stated: "Jesus, during his sojourn in the Himalayan monastery, studied the contents of the Sacred Inspired Writings, the language, the writing and the Cosmic Forces of the Motherland."</p>
 <p>That Jesus was a Master of the Cosmic Forces, with a perfect knowledge of the Original Religion, is manifest in the Books of the New Testament; but it is not there shown that he understood the language of Mu. His acquaintance with it is proved by his last words when nailed to the Cross: "<i>Eli, Eli, lama sabac tha ni</i>."</p>
 <p>This is not Hebrew nor any tongue that was spoken in Asia Minor during the life of Jesus. It is the pure tongue of the Motherland, badly pronounced and spelt in the New Testament. It should have been spelt, read and pronounced: "<i>Hele, hele, lamat zabac ta ni</i>."</p>
 <i></i><p>Translation:</p>
 <p><a name="page_55"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 55</font></a></p>
 <i></i><p>Hele--I faint. <i>Hele</i>--I faint; <i>lamat zabac ta ni</i>--darkness is coming over my face.</p>
 <p>I do not stand alone on this translation. The late Don Antonio Batres Jaurequi, a prominent Maya scholar of Guatemala, in his book, "History of Central America," says: "The last words of Jesus on the Cross were in Maya, the oldest known language." He says they should read, "Hele, Hele, lamah sabac ta ni." Put in English: "Now I am fainting; the darkness covers my face." Thus we virtually agree on all material points. The slight differences are easily explained.</p>
 <p>Jaurequi spells the word "lama<i>h</i>." I spell it "lama<i>t</i>." He spells the word "<i>s</i>abac." I spell it "<i>z</i>abac." This difference is brought about by the translations coming from two different lines of colonization. Mine comes from the Naga-Maya of Eastern Asia; Jaurequi's comes from the modern Maya of Central America. The two, taken from vastly distant parts of the earth, agree in all material points.</p>
