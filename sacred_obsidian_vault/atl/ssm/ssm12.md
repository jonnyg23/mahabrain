 <h3 align="CENTER">RELIGION IN EGYPT AND INDIA</h3>
 <p>THE EGYPTIAN PANTHEON.--Many of our religious conceptions today are strong reflections of the old Egyptian. One might say indeed that our present day religion came to us from Egypt via the Jews. For that reason I have decided to give in this book an Egyptian Pantheon, which I have made up from the Egyptian Book of the Dead.</p>
 <p>In many cases, it will be seen that the symbol of a certain belief or conception is represented by more than one god shown in the Pantheon. Under different guises and different names they, however, symbolize but a single conception. This comes from the scrambling of two sets of symbols when Upper and Lower Egypt were joined and became one kingdom.</p>
 <p>I am giving 24 figures placing them 6 on a page for easy reference. There are many others which I have not included; these are the principal ones only. I can only give an outline description, space will not permit of more. If more data is required about them, it will be found in many books written about Egypt.</p>
 <i></i><p>Amen was the great god at Thebes, and was ad</p>

 <p>dressed as the "King of the gods." The Latinized form of the name is Ammon. The Romans identified him with Jupiter. The Greeks called him Zeus. He is also called "the hidden god." Before the 18th Dynasty he was worshipped at Thebes as <i>Amen</i> simply; but was afterwards merged into <i>Amen Ra</i>: "the hidden Sun." His color was a light blue.</p>
 <i></i><p>Kneph was called "the moulder." He was known by the Greeks as Knonphis. Kneph is one of the oldest of the Egyptian gods and was especially worshipped in Nubia and Philae. His headdress is a ram's head surmounted with a solar disk and uraeus. Kneph is spoken of as "the soul of the Universe" and "The Creator." His color was bright green. Kneph's female consort was Sati.</p>
 <i></i><p>Sati was the female consort of Kneph, and was looked upon as the Egyptian Juno. Her principal seat of worship was Elephantine, and throughout Nubia and Ethiopia. Her headdress was the Crown of Upper Egypt with a pair of cow's horns extending from it. Sati's color was a warm red human flesh color. I think that there can be no question but what Kneph and Sati were intended to symbolize the two principles of the Creator: male and female.</p>
 <i></i><p>Khem was one of the deified attributes of the Creator. His special seat of worship was Chemmo (Panopolis). He was worshipped at Thebes and to some extent throughout Egypt. His headdress consisted of two straight feathers. He was generally colored blue.</p>
 <p><a name="page_255"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 255</font></a></p>
 <p>"<i>Ptah the Opener</i>" was the oldest of the Egyptian gods. His principal seat of worship was at Memphis. Ptah was the symbol of the Creative power of the Deity. The Egyptians called him "the divine artificer." One of his symbols was the two-sided square. <a name="img_25500"></a>
 <img src="img/25500.jpg"> He had many titles; one was: "The Father of beginnings." The Greeks considered Ptah the same as their Vulcan His name, peculiar to Memphis, was Ptah-Sokar-Osiris. The regular Egyptian name, however, was Ptah-Sekar-Usar. His color was blue. Ptah was without doubt the symbol of the Four Great Primary Forces--The Sacred Four.</p>
 <i></i><p>Neith was the Egyptian Minerva, and was the goddess of the lower heavens. She is generally pictured holding up the heavens on her head. Neith was the special goddess at Sais. A corresponding symbol--a god upholding the heavens on his head-is found in the Maya of Yucatan. His color was blue. Neith was the symbol of The Four Great Pillars that upheld the Universe--The Sacred Four.</p>
 <i></i><p>Maut called "the Mother" was the consort of Amen Ra at Thebes, and in this capacity represented the Mother of all: thus in Amen Ra and Maut we find another symbolization of the dual principle of the Creator. Maut was especially worshipped at Thebes in connection with Amen and at Chons with Amen Ra. She was also honored throughout Nubia and Ethiopia. Her color was warm, flesh colored red.</p>

 <i></i><p>Ra was the name of the Sun as the monotheistic symbol of The Creator--monotheistic or collective. In the "Litany of Ra" he is called "the Supreme Power," "the only one," et cetera. To the initiated, he symbolized the power of the Deity; but to the populace he was stated to be a created god, the Son of Ptah and Neith. More errors have been made about this symbol by historians than any other symbol used by the ancients. His color was red.</p>
 <i></i><p>Khepra. Although this symbol is found in the Egyptian Pantheon, it did not originate in Egypt but in the Motherland and was brought to Upper Egypt by the Nagas from the Motherland via Burma and India. The symbol is the Scarab beetle, which is placed over the head of a human figure in the Egyptian symbol. The Scarab symbolizes creative energy.</p>
 <p>From the Papyrus Ani., King's Companion to Seti II: "Among the Egyptians, the Scarabeaus Beetle is no god, but one of the emblems of the Creator, because it rolls a ball of mud between its feet and sets therein its eggs to hatch. As the Creator rolls the world around, and causes it to produce life."</p>
 <p>The foregoing passage is one that should be especially studied by students of the ancient past: for it shows us that the Egyptians up to the time of Seti 2nd understood the ancients' sciences and the workings of the Great Cosmic Forces, both of which are unknown to the scientists of today.</p>
 <p>Before our sciences can advance to any perceptible</p>
 <p><a name="page_258"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 258</font></a></p>
 <p>degree the present grotesque myths, the orthodox scientific teachings, must be abandoned and a study of the Four Great Primeval Forces made. On them the true sciences must be built up--sciences which teach us what life is and how it originates, the workings of the Four Great Forces throughout the Universe, with their origin, et cetera.</p>
 <p>The vignette shows an engraving which I found in a very ancient Maya carving in India. It is thousands of years older than the first occupation of Egypt by man. The engraving is symbolical, as it shows the Creator symbolized by a Scarab, which is placed within rays of glory and rests on the symbol of Mu. Kneeling in adoration on either side of the rays is first man shown by his symbol Kėė the deer.</p>
 <p align="CENTER"><a name="img_25800"></a>
 <img src="img/25800.jpg"></p>
 <p>This vignette is taken from the Egyptian sacred book, the Book of the Dead. It symbolizes man in adoration of the Scarab Beetle as the symbol of the Creator. The Egyptian god Khepra undoubtedly comes out of the Nagas--Kėė</p>
 <i></i><p>Atum or Turn was the god of the setting Sun: otherwise Amenti--the Sun below the horizon.</p>
 <i></i><p>Shu was the firstborn of Ra and Hathor and brother of Tefnut. Shu was looked upon as a symbol of the Celestial Forces. His color was generally black.</p>

 <i></i><p>Mentu was one of the deified attributes of the Sun and often bears the name Mentu-Ra. He was merely a phase of Ra who with Atum symbolized the rising and the setting Sun. Mentu was the special protector of Egypt.</p>
 <i></i><p>Osiris was one of the oldest of the Egyptian gods. Later in this chapter I shall give the history of Osiris and show who he was. In the text of the Book of the Dead it is stated that he was the son of Seb and Nut.</p>
 <i></i><p>Hathor was simply another name for Isis and is represented with the attributes of Isis. She was sometimes called Isis Hathor. Hathor personified Nature with all that was true and beautiful in it--the female principle of the Creator.</p>
 <i></i><p>Isis is the goddess of the triad--Osiris, Isis and Horus. In the triad she was the wife of Osiris.</p>
 <i></i><p>Horus was the son of Osiris and Isis and symbolized the Sun.</p>
 <i></i><p>Seb was the father of Osiris and Isis and was called "the father of gods." Tefnut was his consort. In Seb and Tefnut again we find the dual principles of the Creator symbolized.</p>
 <i></i><p>Khons was worshipped at Thebes, and, with Amen and Maut, formed the Theban triad. Khons symbolized the moon; he wears the disk and crescent moon.</p>
 <i></i><p>Thoth was the god of writing, learning, and medicine. It was he who composed the early and most important portions of the Book of the Dead. Thoth is <i>supposed</i> to be the Egyptian Hermes.</p>

 <i></i><p>Nephthys was the sister of Isis and Osiris and consort of Set.</p>
 <i></i><p>Anubis was the god of embalming and embalmed his father Osiris.</p>
 <i></i><p>Tefnut was the goddess of the rain and dew. She held a conspicuous place among the contemporary deities of Thebes.</p>
 <i></i><p>Ma or Maat was the goddess of truth. She represents the truth and justice of the Supreme God.</p>
 <i></i><p>Nu or Nut. Nut is the feminine form of Nu. Nu was the father, Nut the mother--the life givers.</p>
 <i></i><p>Bast was the wife of Ptah and with their son Tum or Atum formed the great triad of Memphis.</p>
 <i></i><p>Set was the son of Nut and brother of Osiris. According to the myth he murdered Osiris.</p>
 <i></i><p>Anuka was the third member of the triad of Thebaid, composed of Khnum (Kneph), Sati and Anuka.</p>
 <p>OSIRIS.--Osiris was one of the oldest of the Egyptian gods. His worship was universal throughout Egypt at all times. Osiris was the representative of all that was good.</p>
 <p>The myths in Egypt about Osiris are bewildering. They claim that Osiris was once the monarch of Upper and Lower Egypt. It is claimed that Osiris was buried at Philae--other towns claim his remains. According to all these myths, Osiris must have lived since the union of Upper and Lower Egypt was accomplished under Menes about 5,000 B. C.</p>
 <p>Against this we find that Thoth, the founder of the <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>

 <p>Lower Egyptians taught at Sais the Osirian Religion and this was 14,000 B. C. There were no kings of Egypt for an immensely long period after Thoth's time. Egypt was a sub-colony of the Motherland under direct control of the colonial empire--Atlantis.</p>
 <p>Now let us see who Osiris actually was and the time when he lived. In two Himalayan monasteries--one in India, the other in Tibet--there are two Naacal tablets belonging to the Sacred Inspired Writings of the Motherland: they are identically the same, word for word, were copied from the originals in the Motherland and brought to the continent of Asia by Naacal missionaries. They belong to the historical section of the Sacred Books. They relate:</p>
 <p>"Osiris, when entering manhood, left the home of his birth, Atlantis, and came to the motherland where he entered one of the Naacal colleges. Here he studied the religion and Cosmic Sciences of the Motherland. When he passed his degree of Master and adept, he returned to his own country, Atlantis. There he devoted his life to the teachings of the people, the first religion of man, and to weeding out and eliminating extravagances, inventions and misconceptions that had crept into the religion of Atlantis under a rank priesthood."</p>
 <p>Osiris became the Hieratic Head of Religion in Atlantis which office he held during a long life. The people loved and worshipped him for his gentleness, goodness and kindness. They wished to dethrone Ouranos the King and place Osiris on the throne. This <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_265"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 265</font></a></p>
 <p>Osiris would not allow to be spoken of and so condemned the idea that it was abandoned.</p>
 <p>He was murdered by a brother on account of jealousy--this was about 20,000 B. C. His name was so revered, and he so beloved, that at his death he was deified, and as a lasting monument to his name religion was called after him, viz., "The Osirian religion," just as today we have the Christian religion. I could not find the name of the brother who murdered him, so the probability is the Egyptians invented the name. Nor do I find anything about Isis and Nephthys, but it is mentioned that he had a son, who became the Hieratic Head of Atlantis at the death of his father. I do not, however, find his name.</p>
 <p>Osiris and Christ taught identically the same religion. Some of their preachings are word for word, line for line, and sentence for sentence the same. Both learned from the same book--the Sacred Inspired Writings of the Motherland.</p>
 <p>THE RELIGION OF EGYPT.--The first we know about the religion of Egypt is where an ancient record states that about 16,000 years ago Thoth, the son of an Atlantian Priest, planted the Egyptian colony at the mouth of the Nile, and at Saïs on the banks of the Nile built a temple and taught the Osirian religion.</p>
 <p>The Osirian religion as I have previously shown was the religion of Mu after Osiris had cleansed it of all the extravagances that had crept into it in Atlantis, 22,000 years ago, the religion being then called after</p>
 <p><a name="page_266"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 266</font></a></p>
 <p>him the Osirian religion. When he died his son became the hieratical head and was supposed to be called Horus, but whether Horus was his actual name or a title I cannot say, but a Horus was always the hieratical head of the Osirian religion down to the time of Menes or about S,000 B. C. Thus it is shown that the religion of Egypt commenced with that of the Motherland as taught in the Sacred Inspired Writings.</p>
 <p>From the time of Thoth down to the time of Menes, the Egyptian colony was ruled by the church, under the head of a Horus. The last Horus is recorded when Menes took the throne.</p>
 <p>Manetho, the Egyptian priest historian, says that during the 11th Dynasty the priesthood began to teach the people to worship the Sacred Symbols instead of the <a href="errata.htm#5">Deity</a> Himself as heretofore. This was the first step to the debauchery of the Egyptian religion which reached its peak during the 18th Dynasty and ended in every conceivable extravagance coupled with idolatry. The advent of Mohammedanism wiped out the old religion of Egypt, although the Christian religion had made a little headway owing to a people called the Copts.</p>
 <p>We must now go back some few hundred years to the time when the Israelites were the slaves of the Egyptians. A Master rose up among them--Moses. Who was Moses? And how did he form a religion? Who he was is a question; but he was the most proficient Master of his time, and, at one time, was the High Priest of the temple at Sinai, which then was an <font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font> </p>
 <p><a name="page_267"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 267</font></a></p>
 <p>Osirian temple. Whatever Moses was, it is known that his wife was an Israelite and that he threw in his lot with the Israelites in all their troubles and adversities contingent with slavery. They elected him their head. He saw the Osirian or the Inspired Religion being debased by idolatry and was determined to save his people from it, so he modified the ancient Osirian religion to suit the then existing surroundings and conditions. The symbols of the attributes of the Deity, he discarded almost entirely, retaining only a few which could not very well be worshipped. He made the worship of one Lord God only--the Deity.</p>
 <p>Many of the teachings in the Osirian religion were in the form of questions. These he condensed and put into the form of commands. As for example: Osirian--Have you honored and do you honor your father and mother, et cetera. Moses--Honor your father and your mother, et cetera. There were forty-two questions in the Osirian. Moses turned them into ten commands.</p>
 <p>Many readers of the Bible have been nonplussed when they come across the passage where Moses makes a serpent for the people to look upon in the Wilderness. Some claim that it was a touch of idolatry. It was nothing of the kind. Circumstances warranted him in returning to symbolism for the occasion. The symbol--the Serpent--was to concentrate their thoughts on God as the Creator and the Giver of All Good Things.</p>
 <p>One of the ceremonies among the Jews was a burnt sacrifice. The Bible tells us that the sons of the <i>first</i> </p>
 <p><a name="page_268"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 268</font></a></p>
 <p>man, Adam, offered up burnt sacrifices. Yet among ancient records we find that 60,000,000 of people lost their lives at one time in the same land before sacrifices were commenced.</p>
 <p>I never came across the word sacrifice or its equivalent in any of the writings of the First Civilization. The first time I saw the word was in an old Maya book about 5,000 or 6,000 years old in which it says: "And during the night Mu was <i>sacrificed</i>." In the writings of the First Civilization offerings only are mentioned; these offerings consisted generally of fruit, flowers and products of the fields and gardens. These were taken to the temple and placed on an altar specially provided for the ceremony. On the front of this altar were inscribed the Tau and underneath each arm was a double triangle that reads: "Place thine offering upon this altar."</p>
 <p>After Mu went down with her 60,000,000 of souls, all the surviving people of the world commemorated her memory in one way or another, some by literature, some by edifices and others by fire in some form. The Quiche Mayas had a fiery house in their religious ceremonies; the Egyptians a fiery tank in theirs; and without doubt burnt sacrifices in the beginning was the form the Semites chose. In later years the Jews applied a theology to the ceremony. I wonder if there is a single Jew living today who knows the origin of their burnt sacrifices. I have never yet found one. The Phoenicians, another Semitic race, adopted idolatry and fell so low</p>
 <p><a name="page_269"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 269</font></a></p>
 <p>as to degrade themselves by offering human beings for sacrifice.</p>
 <p>Was Moses an Israelite? An Egyptian record would lead one to believe that he was not a pure Israelite. The record I refer to says: "Moses was the son of an Egyptian Princess who afterwards became the great Queen Hatshepsut." Not a word is said about the bull-rushes.</p>
 <p>As an example of the gross extravagances in symbols and teachings of the Egyptian priesthood I shall take the triad--Osiris, Isis and Horus. Let us see who they were and what was taught from them.</p>
 <p>Osiris was a <i>man</i> who lived on earth and about whom there are many Egyptian myths. There is also a short authentic history about him, showing that he was a great Master and lived about 22,000 years ago. Isis was the <i>symbol</i> of the Creator's female attribute. From this union a son was born called Horus. Isis had a sister called Nephthys and a brother called Set. So that the female attribute of the Creator had three members--two females and one male--Isis, Nephthys and Set.</p>
 <p>In plain unadorned language the foregoing says: An <i>earthly man</i> Osiris marries <i>a spirit a female attribute of the Creator</i> Isis and they have a son. But Isis was <i>only one</i> forming the <i>female</i> attribute of the Creator. The writings of the Motherland say the Creator was Lahun, <i>two in one, not</i> four in one.</p>
 <p>Can anything more grotesque or atrocious than the foregoing be imagined? Yet this seems to be the theology</p>
 <p><a name="page_270"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 270</font></a></p>
 <p>and teachings of the Egyptian priesthood for a long period in their history--thousands of years. Is it any wonder that they were thrown into the discard? Dozen of other examples could be quoted, but I think this one all sufficient to show the abuses engrafted into their religion.</p>
 <p>During the early part of the history of religion in Egypt, such grossness does not appear. As soon as we know anything about her religion we find its theology very complicated and, without question, this complicated theology was the parent of the diabolical abuses which crept into religion later on.</p>
 <p>In the early Egyptian religion I find symbolizations ran somewhat parallel with that of the Polynesians. For instance, the marriage of gods. There is, however, this difference. The result of the marriage of Egyptian gods with other gods was only further to complicate theology. With the Polynesians the marriage of gods resulted in phenomena, such as light, sound, et cetera, which is correct, being the workings of the Cosmic Forces. I shall now give some examples both Egyptian and Polynesian.</p>
 <p>The Polynesians believe that all that has been created came from the marriage of gods. The first four gods were the Four Great Primary Forces--a name given them during the earth's First Great Civilization. The Polynesians say: "In the beginning there was no light, life or sound in the world. A boundless night called Po enveloped everything, over which Tanaoa (darkness)</p>
 <p><a name="page_271"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 271</font></a></p>
 <p>and Mutu-Hei (silence) reigned supreme. Then the god of light separated from Tanaoa (darkness), fought him and drove him away, and confined him to the night. Then the god Ono (sound) was evolved from Atea (light) and banished silence. From all this struggle was Atauana (dawn) born. Atea (light) married Atauana (dawn) and they created earth, animals and man."</p>
 <p>Now let us have a little Egyptian Cosmogony:--</p>
 <p>Seb and Tefnut: offspring, the gods: Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Set.</p>
 <p>Ra and Hathor: offspring, the gods: Shu and Tefnut.</p>
 <p>Osiris and Isis: offspring, the god: Horus.</p>
 <p>There were also the marriages of the gods and goddesses:</p><dir>
 <dir>
 
 <p>Amen Ra and Maut.</p>
 <p>Kneph and Sati.</p>
 <p>Ptah and Bast.</p>
 <p>Set and Nephthys.</p></dir>
 </dir>
 
 <p>I have shown what all these gods symbolized, in a short way, in the Pantheon.</p>
 <p>THE ISRAELITES IN EGYPT.--While we are on the subject of the Israelites, let us follow them in their Exodus from Egypt.</p>
 <p>When the Israelites made their exodus from Egypt, they left Goshen which is a part of the Nile Delta, and, according to Egyptian records (papyrus), they crossed the "<i>Sea of Reeds</i>" and passed into Asia. The Sea of Reeds or rushes is situated at one of the mouths of the</p>
 <p><a name="page_272"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 272</font></a></p>
 <p>Nile. The water is very shallow and most of it can be waded without danger. When they arrived at the Sea of Reeds a submarine earthquake occurred in the Mediterranean Sea off the mouth of the Nile--probably on the gas belt which runs down from Crete and extends under Africa a short distance from the Nile Delta. This quake first drew off the water, leaving the Sea of Reeds dry--the Israelites passed over, the Egyptian army followed. During its passage the returning cataclysmic wave rolled in over the Sea of Reeds overwhelming the Egyptians. A mistranslation evidently occurs in the Bible. The Sea of Reeds was mistaken for the Red Sea. The Red Sea at the point where it is stated the Israelites crossed lies 200 miles from Goshen. The Sea of Reeds joined Goshen. To have crossed the Red Sea, the Israelites would have had to pass through 200 miles of enemy country, with an army in close pursuit, which means that they would have been overtaken and slain.</p>
 <i></i><p>Pillars: The Israelites when in bondage in Egypt erected two pillars of brick at the entrance of their temples. In the inner part of these temples was the Holy of Holies where only the high priest might enter.</p>
 <i></i><p>The Hebrews: The word "hebrew" comes from ebber meaning further back. Apparently, the Jews descended from four groups. Two of the tribes entered Palestine about 1375-1350 B. C. Later ten tribes joined them. These came from Egypt about 1200 B. C. or from 150 to 175 years later than the two tribes.</p>
 <p><a name="page_273"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 273</font></a></p>
 <p>About 973 B. C. the tribes separated, the two seceded and appointed Jeraboam their king. Reaboam was at the time the king of the ten tribes.</p>
 <p>Years later, the Assyrians attacked the ten tribes, and history states that the Assyrians destroyed them. Whether or not they were wholly destroyed they disappeared from history and are now spoken of as "<i>the lost tribes</i>."</p>
 <p>It cannot be conceived that all were put to the sword. Unquestionably some were taken into captivity, and became assimilated with the Assyrians, especially as both were Semites.</p>
 <p>The Assyrians in turn were overthrown by the Medes and Persians. What has become of the Assyrians? Among their descendants today, we should, no doubt, find some of the descendants of the ten tribes, but whether there would be any of them with pure Israelitish blood in them is very doubtful.</p>
 <p>Still later, the Babylonians conquered the two remaining tribes. These still survive in our Jews of today. They are, however, scattered throughout the world among all nations.</p>
 <p>These Jews hold the Feast of the Passover-- Why? They are the descendants of the two tribes who were not in Egypt. It was the ten lost tribes that were concerned in the Exodus and consequently the Passover.</p>
 <p>Ezra and his associates wrote the Bible. What is known as the Book of Moses was written by them from documents obtained from the ten tribes who were</p>
 <p><a name="page_274"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 274</font></a></p>
 <p>in Egypt. The writings of Moses were partly in Naga and partly in Egyptian. Ezra obtained a slight knowledge of Naga in a Chaldi during the time he was in captivity; but neither Ezra nor any of his associates were Egyptian scholars. Is it any wonder they made so many errors in translating the Egyptian? Yet for all their errors their work was wonderful.</p>
 <p>THE RELIGION OF INDIA.--The religion of very ancient India was that of the Motherland, brought there from Mu by the Naacals, a holy brotherhood. These men were taught religion and the Cosmic Sciences in the Motherland and when proficient were sent to the colonial empires to form colleges and perfect the local priesthoods, who in turn taught the people.</p>
 <p>About 5,000 years ago, a race of Aryans began to drift down into India from the bleak valleys of the Hindu Koosh and adjoining mountains. Their first settlement was among the Nagas in the Saraswatte Valley. They were just hardy mountaineers, uncouth and uneducated. The Nagas, the most highly educated race in the world, took compassion on them, welcomed them into their schools and colleges, educated and advanced them. The Nagas received them too well for their own good, for, it called from the mountains nearly all who had multiplied there since the destruction of the great Uighur Empire of whom they were descendants. In time these Aryans dominated the whole of the Northern parts of India including their schools and colleges. Thinking they had learnt from the Naacals all there</p>
 <p><a name="page_275"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 275</font></a></p>
 <p>was to be learnt, they proceeded to drive their gentle, kindly instructors out of the country into the snowcapped mountains of the North.</p>
 <p>After a period a sect was formed which was called Brahmins who took or usurped the charge of religious teachings. To attain their own ends, they introduced into religion perverted, incomprehensible theologies having all kinds of extravagance. This was the commencement of the downfall of India, which gained impetus as time went on. They introduced caste, commencing with three only. The caste system was extended, until at last the lowest caste was looked upon as untouchables, and for a touch of an untouchable, the receiver of a higher caste must go into a purification before he could be received again by his own people. The result of this was the final step which brought India down from the high position of leading the world in religion, arts and sciences. All that was left were a few embers where at one time was the bright light of a fire representing everything worth-while in life.</p>
 <p>Then a great one sprang up among them, a Prince Guatama. He went back to the original teachings of the Sacred Writings. A vast throng followed his teachings and these became the Buddhists. Buddhism was carried throughout the Orient and was the universal religion.</p>
 <p>It was only a question of time before a crafty priesthood began its negative work. The Buddhist priesthood of Northern India fell away from the gentle</p>
 <p><a name="page_276"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 276</font></a></p>
 <p>teacher, Guatama Buddha, and introduced all sorts of impossible theologies and theories for the sole purpose of enslaving the people. Only those in the South remained true to Guatama's actual teachings. Today the center of Buddhism is a little unostentatious temple at Kandy, in the Central Mountains of Ceylon. But with all these priestly traps and pitfalls common to religions today a spark of the truth has been again kindled and will soon shine throughout the world. Priesthoods and politicians never have seen nor ever will see "the writing on the wall" until those walls are falling on them and it becomes too late to escape. This has been the history of the world for the past 12,000 to 15,000 years. The people rise and crush the politicians and the Lord, in <i>His own way</i>, weeds his garden.</p>

 <p>A U M is an inscription that has baffled scholars and scientists throughout the world, the Hindus included, for more than 2,300 years. Its import was lost when the Naacals were driven out of India by the Brahmins. Many scholars have attempted to fathom its meaning. None, however, arrived at any satisfactory conclusions; even the oldest are indefinite. Examples:</p>
 <i></i><p>Manava dharma Sastra an ancient Hindu book. Book 2. Sloka 74. "In the beginning the Infinite only existed called Aditi. In this Infinite dwelt A U M</p>
 <p><a name="page_277"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 277</font></a></p>
 <p>whose name must precede all prayers and invocations."</p>
 <i></i><p>Book of Manu, Sloka 77. "The monosyllable A U M means earth sky and heaven."</p>
 <i></i><p>I. T. Wheeler, History of India, Vol. 2. Page 481 says:</p>
 <p>"As regards the three letters A U M little can be gathered, excepting, that when brought together in the word A U M they are said by Manu to form a symbol of the Lord of created things--Brahma."</p>
 <i></i><p>H. T. Colebrook in <i>Asiatic Research</i> says: "According to Noruka which is an ancient glossary of the Vedas the syllable A U M refers to <i>every</i> Deity.</p>
 <p>"The Brahmins may reserve for their initiates an esoteric more ample than that given by Manu."</p>
 <p>Noruka must have been reading a Brahminical version of the Vedas, which they stole from the Naacals, changed it to suit their own vile purposes and then foisted it on the world as their own writings.</p>
 <p>The <i>Original Vedas</i> are a Naacal writing. The Naacals acknowledged <i>One</i> Deity only. Therefore, when Noruka mentions "<i>every</i> Deity" it shows without the possibility of contradiction that the Vedas which he refers to were altered and doctored and were not the original writings.</p>
 <p>A U M conveys identically the same meaning and conception as the Mysterious Writing and Niven's Mexican tablet No. 2379. The difference between these and A U M is in the form of the writing. The Mysterious Writing and the Mexican tablet are in the old</p>
 <p><a name="page_278"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 278</font></a></p>
 <p>temple esoteric numeral writing. The Hindu A U M is written in alphabetical symbols which reads:</p>
 
 <table cellspacing="0" border="0" cellpadding="9" width="489">
 <tr><td width="37%" valign="TOP">
 <p>A--Ahau</p></td>
 <td width="63%" valign="TOP">
 <p>Masculine-Father</p></td>
 </tr>
 <tr><td width="37%" valign="TOP">
 <p>U--</p></td>
 <td width="63%" valign="TOP">
 <p>Feminine--Mother--She</p></td>
 </tr>
 <tr><td width="37%" valign="TOP">
 <p>M--Mehen</p></td>
 <td width="63%" valign="TOP">
 <p>The engendered--The Son--Man</p></td>
 </tr>
 </table>
 
 <p> </p>
 <i></i><p>Note: U is here used as the feminine pronoun--She. M would have been used but it would have been con founded with the following M for Mehen.</p>
 <p>The Brahmins formed a complicated theology around this conception, introducing a confusion absolutely incomprehensible to the people. It became a wonderful breeder of awe and superstition.</p>
 <p>BIBLICAL SYMBOLISMS TAKEN LITERALLY. <i>Tower of Babel</i>: The Biblical <i>Tower of Babel</i> has been literally taken as a structure of stone or brick. From some old writings, I am brought to believe that it is a purely symbolical term: that "confusion of tongues" is the crux of the legend.</p>
 <p>This legend was not written during the life of Mu. It came later, many years later, when ancient history was being recorded again and mankind once more widely populated the earth. It was therefore a product of the New Civilization.</p>
 <p>Extravagances in theology and technology in the various temples, colleges and schools were the cause of the "Confusion of tongues" and the whole structure of Religion and Science was the Tower. Each temple had its own terms and words for its theology. Each college and school had its own particular words and</p>
 <p><a name="page_279"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 279</font></a></p>
 <p>terms for its technical teachings. So that no temple or college could understand the teachings of another. All in fact spoke different languages, no one understanding another. This made a "Tower of Confusion," "A Babel of Tongues": so that the name given to the condition was the only one which would adequately describe it.</p>
 <p>Today we are running headlong into another such storm, another such confusion of tongues. We have over 100 sects of Christianity, yet there is only one God. Each sect declares all others are in error. They cannot comprehend each other's language. In Mu there were no sects, no theology. All teachings and wording were so simple that the most uncultivated mind could comprehend them. Mu's religious teachings lasted 200,000 years. When the present Tower of Babel comes crashing to the ground, a new structure will arise on its ruins. And that structure will be the simple religion of Mu.</p>
 <p>The <i>Flood</i>: The Biblical legend of the Flood is not a myth nor is it symbolical. It has been wrongly described. Those who wrote the Biblical description simply failed to understand the writings of Moses.</p>
 <p>There was a flood which destroyed about one half of the earth and all life thereon; but it was not due to a heavy rain. The Flood resulted from magnetic influences.</p>
 <p>The Last Magnetic Cataclysm, the Biblical Flood and the Geological Myth, the Glacial Period, are all one and the same thing.</p>
