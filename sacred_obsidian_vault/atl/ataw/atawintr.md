 <p>Ignatius Donnelly (1831-1901), lawyer, land promoter,
 politician and virtuoso author, is today best known for
 his pioneering work on the subject of Atlantis, 
 "Atlantis the Antediluvian World" (ATAW).
 Published in 1882, ATAW is one of the best constructed
 Atlantis theories, as it makes no recourse to occult or
 'channeled' information. Donnelly's lucid style and command
 of the facts (such as they were) make the book
 readable and compelling even today.</p>
 <p>Donnelly started public service as Lieutenant-Governor
 of Minnesota, and then was elected to Congress in 1863.
 While in Washington D.C., he frequented the Library of Congress
 and did much of the research for ATAW.
 After returning to private life, he completed ATAW and
 finally published it in 1882, followed shortly 
 by his other masterpiece 'Ragnarök, the Age of Fire and Gravel'.
 Donnelly also wrote 'The Great Cryptogram', in which he proposed
 that Sir Francis Bacon was the real author of Shakespeare's plays.
 However it was ATAW that secured Donnelly's reputation.
 ATAW was an instant bestseller and has been in print 
 ever since. ATAW inspired generations of occultists who
 claimed to 'channel' the Ultimate Truth from ancient Atlantis.</p>
 <p>At the center of Donnelly's thesis are a set of similarities
 between widely separated cultures.
 This he interpreted as evidence that all civilization diffused 
 outward from a central point (a now sunken continent in
 the mid-Atlantic). He cites mythological, linguistic,
 ethnographic and other evidence for this theory, 
 which at the time seemed to add up to an airtight case.</p>
 <p>Donnelly proposes a literal interpretation of Plato's
 account of Atlantis. He also ties Atlantis into the global
 flood myth-complex. These, until recently, have been two
 of the most compelling unsolved puzzles of history. What was Plato 
 writing about when he described the prehistoric civilization
 of Atlantis, which disappeared overnight in a great catastrophe?
 Was this an actual historical account, or a philosophical fable?
 And why do widely separated cultures on every 
 continent, Australia, the Americas, Europe and Asia all
 have a similar myth of a great flood from which only
 a few humans survived to restart civilization?</p>
 <p>It is only in the past half century
 that proposals based in scientific fact 
 have been proposed to solve these conundrums.
 It now appears that these two 
 problems may actually be totally unrelated
 (although both have a spectacular 
 origin related to catastrophes of geological scale).</p>
 <p>The most commonly accepted hypothesis is that
 Plato's account of Atlantis can be explained by the 
 Thera catastrophe. A thriving Minoan-era culture in
 the Aegean was destroyed by a volcanic eruption on
 the scale of Krakatoa or Mt. Saint Helens, on
 the island of Thera circa 1500 B.C.
 This catastrophic explosion appears to have coincided with
 the start of the downfall of the Minoan civilization
 on the island of Crete, so it may have been accompanied by
 ash falls or tsunamis which destroyed coastal towns, reducing
 the viability of Minoan civilization (the economy was largely
 based on maritime activities).</p>
 <p>The Thera discoveries have been extensively documented;
 portions of the city on Thera which the explosion
 covered with lava has been excavated and are eerily 
 similar to Plato's account. The layout of the
 Thera city had several circular canals surrounding a
 central acropolis just as Plato described (reduced in size 
 by a factor of ten). The date was about 900 years
 prior to Plato, which is also a factor of ten less
 than the 9000 years that Plato gave for the destruction 
 of Atlantis.   So it is now accepted by
 mainstream archaeologists that an entire civilization could have
 been destroyed 'in a single day'.</p>
 <p>The global flood myth, although less well understood,
 may be a recollection of the rapid sea-level changes at
 the end of the Ice Age, when the sea rose 
 300 feet within a few hundred years.
 The chronology of the rise in sea levels 
 11,500 years ago has been verified
 recently by radio-isotope 
 studies of ice cores extracted deep from
 the Greenland ice sheet. Areas significant 
 for human migration such as the Indonesian archipelago,
 the English Channel, the Bering land-bridge
 and areas of the Caribbean were all flooded at this time. 
 Ironically, this global flooding occurred fairly close to
 the time which Plato cited for the destruction of Atlantis
 (i.e., about 9,500 B.C.).
 This flooding was rapid only in geologic terms, and would be
 barely noticable in a human lifespan, except in one case that
 has come to light.</p>
 <p>Recent submarine exploration of the Black Sea
 between Turkey and the Ukraine indicate that a
 natural dam at the isthmus leading to the Mediterranean burst 
 during this period. Up to this point the Black Sea
 was much smaller than it is today.
 This rapid flooding appears to have overwhelmed a
 widespread Neolithic culture living in its basin
 in an extremely short time, possibly days or hours.
 The survivors may have migrated south to the Fertile
 Crescent, and the memory of the disaster evolved into
 the Biblical flood story.</p>
 <p>At least Donnelly claimed that Atlantis was in
 the Atlantic, which at least 
 makes logical sense if you take Plato at his word.
 The sole weak part of the 
 Thera hypothesis is the hand waving required to
 explain away Plato's unambiguous statement that
 Atlantis was "beyond the pillars of Hercules"
 and "larger than Libya and Asia [Minor] combined".
 It is also remarkable that Plato's description 
 of the geography of the Atlantic is so accurate.
 He mentions that there is a 
 continent on the other side of the Atlantic,
 beyond where Atlantis was situated, 
 and describes the Mediterranean as 'but a harbor'
 compared to the rest of the ocean.
 This seems to indicate, at the very least,
 that someone had navigated 
 the Atlantic in antiquity and returned to tell the tale.</p>
 <p>Donnelly attaches a lot of significance to
 the mid-Atlantic ridge, which had just been discovered by 
 the Challenger and Dolphin expeditions.
 The mid-Atlantic ridge when looked at without the covering ocean
 looks suggestively like a huge continental mass.
 However, we know today
 it is very different in origin: it is the result of the 
 American, European and African tectonic plates colliding.
 It may be rising (albeit very slowly) instead of sinking.
 Unfortunately for Atlantis, most of this ridge lies 
 at abysmal depths, and has probably never been
 above water at any time.
 This has been confirmed by the extremely deep sediments
 (hundreds of meters thick) that cover it, which can only be
 produced by millions of years of inundation.</p>
 <p>As time has gone by, every nook and cranny
 of the globe has been claimed as 
 the 'real' Atlantis: Bolivia, the North Sea off Denmark,
 Indonesia, the Bahamas and Antarctica 
 are some of theories for the location.</p>
 <p>Very little actual physical evidence has been presented for
 solutions other than Thera for the location of Atlantis.
 We don't know of any sunken structures off the
 Azores, which would make the most sense if the mid-Atlantic
 area was Atlantis.
 There are submerged cyclopean stone roads in the Bimini
 area in the Bahamas, which may or may not be natural
 geological formations. These structures, discovered
 by scuba divers in 1968, are often cited as
 fulfilment of a prophecy of Edgar Cayce that Atlantis 
 would be rediscovered (or possibly rise from the ocean depths)
 in the 1960s. 
 Of course Cayce predicted that California would <i>sink</i>
 into the ocean about the same time, so I wouldn't
 attach too much significance to it.</p>
 <p>A reasonable explanation for the Bimini road
 might be that some unknown ice-age culture constructed
 the road (possibly for ceremonial reasons) when the sea-level 
 was lower.  The Bahamas, today a string
 of small islands, are surrounded by an extensive shelf area which
 was a fairly large island (the size of Cuba) during the ice-ages.
 Megalithic cultures in Malta were building similar structures at 
 about the same time, so this was technologically feasible
 for the period. It doesn't mean that this culture
 were the elusive Atlanteans, nor does it require 
 any kind of extraterrestrial or advanced technology.</p>
 <p>As noted, some have hypothesized that the Bimini road is just a
 natural geological formation.  However, recent submerged finds
 off the coast of Japan which appear to be a megalithic ceremonial
 center reinforce the fact that we don't
 yet have all of the evidence.</p>
 <p>The North Sea was also flooded at the end of the Ice Ages
 and was certainly occupied by humans, as shown by the artifacts
 that come up in fishing nets occasionally. 
 However there is no evidence that the inhabitants
 of the now sunken North Sea areas were anything
 but nomadic hunter-gatherers.</p>
 <p>As far as documentary evidence goes,
 the 15th century Piri Reis map is often 
 cited as evidence of a technologically
 advanced prehistoric civilization. This 
 Turkish map, which is reputedly based on
 a collection of earlier maps, apparently 
 shows a surprisingly accurate representation
 of the coast of Antarctica--free of ice.
 It also purportedly shows accurate features of
 the North and South American continents which
 had not been explored by Europeans at the time.</p>
 <p>As Antarctica was only recently discovered by modern
 explorers, and the coast has been covered with ice 
 for a very long time (possibly hundreds of thousands 
 of years), this is anomalous, to say the least. 
 A vast southern continent resembling Antarctica
 was sketched in on maps from very ancient times;
 but this might be just a lucky guess.
 However, this "Terra Incognita Australis" 
 was just a fantasy land at the edges of the map,
 with landforms that bear no resemblance to reality.
 The Piri Reis map appears to match modern knowledge
 of the subglacial coastline.</p>
 <p>The position of the followers of Charles Hapgood
 (who studied the map extensively in the 1950s)
 is that the Earth's crust shifted in the year 9600 B.C. At this 
 time, Antarctica shifted several hundred miles south.
 Prior to the shift an ice-free Antarctica was home
 to--you guessed it, the Atlanteans. The publication 
 of this theory ended Hapgood's academic career,
 despite support from none other than Albert Einstein.
 Hapgood's books 'the Earth's Shifting Crust', 'the Path 
 of the Pole', and the recently republished 'Maps of
 the Ancient Sea Kings' are required reading for
 anyone interested in lost continents. Recently Rand and 
 Rose Flem-Ath have picked up the torch with their
 excellent book 'When the Sky Fell'.
 Hapgood and the Flem-Aths support a modern
 version of the diffusionist 
 theory of culture. </p>
 <p>Donnelly's diffusionist argument is
 based on an extensive but ultimately flimsy 
 collation of poorly understood ethnographic,
 mythological and linguistic evidence that unfortunately has
 not stood the test of time. Much of the underpinnings 
 of his thesis have been completely discredited.
 One prime example is the bogus Bishop Landa Mayan
 alphabet on which he bases an entire labored chapter trying 
 to prove that the Atlanteans invented writing.</p>
 <p>The diffusion theory which Donnelly develops in
 the last two thirds of ATAW is 
 today very out of favor. Such items as the couvade,
 polytheism, burial and marriage customs, 
 and circumcision rituals cited by Donnelly do not
 prove that all culture spread 
 out from one center in the (comparatively recent) past.
 Some of these cultural traits may go back as far
 as the Paleolithic.</p>
 <p>Furthermore, most of the linguistic evidence that
 Donnelly cites would not even stand up to 19th century methodology.
 He cites a jumble of accidental word similarities between
 unrelated languages, throwing in examples from Indo-European 
 (which of course, are related); this creates an
 optical illusion of similarity where there is none.
 He makes no attempt to find a systematic connection between 
 the vocabularies he presents.
 This is not to say that there might not be a connection 
 between the languages he cites; it's just that Donnelly
 presents no scientific, etymological proof that there is any.
 The balance of the linguistic evidence that he
 presents is just hearsay or speculation by non-experts.</p>
 <p>It is now known that there was not exactly an airtight
 separation between the Old World and the New.
 Today even very conservative historians are comfortable 
 with the idea that the Norse got to America earlier than
 Columbus, because of firm documentation and archaeological
 evidence from Newfoundland. There is accepted evidence
 (because of Thor Heyerdahl's expeditions and research)
 that the Polynesians and South Americans, and possibly
 the Egyptians and the Meso-Americans could have had
 trans-ocean contact.</p>
 <p>There is also a body of controversial but not
 completely implausible cultural, archeological and documentary
 evidence that Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Sub-Saharan Africans, Welsh,
 Irish, Japanese, and Chinese could have had contacts
 with New World cultures. There are
 quite a few (possibly hoaxed, possibly not)
 New World runic inscriptions, particularly in New
 England and the Great Lakes area. Other inscriptions
 resembling Phoenician have turned up in the New World.
 There are statues with African features in the Yucatan.
 Conversely, traces of tobacco and coca have turned up in Egyptian tombs,
 plants which were only thought to have existed on the other side
 of the Atlantic at the time.
 There are legends of Chinese explorers reaching the American
 southwest in antiquity. As the Chinese during their exploratory 
 period sailed as far as Madagascar, this is not entirely
 out of the question.  Recently a book was published
 suggesting links between the Zuñis and the Japanese, and
 the author was treated receptively by academic reviewers.
 In addition, some have suggested that there may
 have been very early oceanic migration into the New World from the
 European side of the Atlantic.</p>
 <p>This is a fascinating subject, and makes for interesting
 speculation. However, nobody is claiming
 that this is evidence for a global Atlantean Empire, 
 as Donnelly did. </p>
 <p>Some parts of Donnelly's writing today appear naively
 racist by today's standards. He seems unduly concerned
 about documenting minor variations in skin color,
 the lighter the better.
 He has occasionally been accused of being a racist or an anti-semite,
 based on out-of-context quotes. To set the record straight,
 during Donnelly's career in the Civil War era
 US House of Representatives he was a strong Lincoln loyalist
 and very vocal about the preserving the Union. 
 After the publication of ATAW he became a leading
 figure in the Farmers' Alliance, which later became
 the Populist Party, and wrote the platform for the
 Populist Party in the election of 1892.
 Donnelly was an early representative of the progressive
 political heritage of the upper midwest, the forerunner
 of such figures as Paul Wellstone.
 Keep in mind that by the standards of his time
 he was very progressive.
 And obviously we can't hold him to a rigorous
 standard of 21st century political correctness.</p>
 <p>However, the most flawed aspects of Donnelly's
 diffusionist theory have been (consciously or unconsciously)
 echoed by such modern authors as Von Daniken 
 and Zecharia Sitchen. These authors just substitute
 'Extraterrestrial' for 'Atlantean'. Unfortunately,
 they end up aping the worst aspects of the theory. 
 Von Daniken finds it hard to believe that 'primitive'
 cultures such as the Meso- and South Americans could
 construct pyramids, erect cyclopean and megalithic stonework,
 invent writing, an accurate calendar, and a numeric system with
 a representation for 'zero'.
 Why does there <i>have</i> to be some outside influence,
 be it Atlanteans, Great White Brothers or 
 Extraterrestrials?  I say this reeks of first world chauvinism,
 regardless of whether the Earth has been 'visited'.</p>
 <p>So most of Donnelly's argument has been invalidated.
 Why then does this book continue to be so compelling?
 Perhaps it is because we don't want Atlantis to go away.
 The image is seductive; the idea that somewhere 
 there is a completely undiscovered lost civilization
 brimming with artifacts made from precious metals
 brings out the Indiana Jones in all of us. </p>
