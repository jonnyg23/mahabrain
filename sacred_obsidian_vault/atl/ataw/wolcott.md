 With the posting of "Atlantis-The Antediluvian World" by Ignatius
 Donnelly,
 the following may be of interest.
 
 </p><p>
 I am perhaps one of the few who remember visiting Nininger, 
 the farm on the banks of the Mississippi River below Hastings,
 Minnesota where a wooden spiral bridge once crossed the river.
 I remember in the 1930's my father driving over the bridge,
 afraid that it would collapse, and then proceeding
 with some teacher friends a few miles south to the site.  Ninninger was a
 land speculation of Donnelly when he went to Minnesota in the 1850's.  The
 name of the town had a germanic ring perhaps catering to german immigrants
 who came to southern Minnesota.  A pamphlet advertising Nininger was
 published in english and german in Philadelphia in 1856 .The town was to be
 a Utopian village; I remember seeing a flyer showing the
 layout of the streets, but I forget their names, I believe they
 were alphabetical. There were markers in the ground on the street corners.
 The only house was Donnelly's, a large mansion (it seemed to me) on the
 bluff overlooking the river which we went through after paying a small fee.
 It was still in good condition being only some 30 years
 after Donnelly's death in 1901.</p>
 
 <p>
 I remember seeing Donnelly's grey pigskin gloves, top hat, on a table and
 his ivory headed cane  in an umbrella stand in the foyer. The house
 apparently had original furniture in it. Nininger was to profit by being a stop on the river boat trade which plyed the Mississippi from St. Paul,
 Hastings, on to Red Wing  and Frontenac. The all-weather railroad built
 inland ended this speculation. I believe all is now gone, no one wants to
 have a historic building on their land any more. (see attached Nininger
 bibliography--a fruitless attempt
 was apparently made between 1932 and 1948
 to save Donnelly's house and make the surrounding Nininger
 a state park) The Minnesota Historical
 Society which has a web site has a large collection of Donnelly books and
 materials.</p>
 
 <p>
 As a high school student working in the library I read Donnelly's
 "The Cipher in the Plays and on the Tombstone" which I was told I should not
 be reading. It concludes with a decipherment that "Bacon wrote Shakespeare,
 Greene, and Marlowe's works". At least the book was not removed by the
 censors. Donnelly's political contributions may have been marginal, but with
 "Atlantis" he created the genre of "pseudo-science" culminating in such
 works as I. A Velikovsky's "Worlds in Collision".
 And the impetus given to the Shakespeare myth has lasted over a century.</p>
 
 <p>
 One must not be too critical of Donnelly; Atlantis was the product of
 the science of his time. The discoveries of Schliemann at Troy and Mycenae
 showed that the ancient greek legends were to be taken seriously
 as real history. What better then than to start with Plato's Atlantis?
 Little was known then of new world geology or ethnology which the next
 century would reveal. And Donnelly's hyperbolic oratory makes for a fun read.
     As the attached bibliography shows, recently there has been some
 academic interest in Donnelly with several PhD theses. His Phoenix may yet
 rise from the ashes of history.</p>
