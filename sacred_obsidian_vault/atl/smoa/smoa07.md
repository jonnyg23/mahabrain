 <p align="center"><i>Other inventions of the Atlantians. The science of Ellipse of Sound</i>.</p>  
 <p>They measured grains of metal by the weight of rule and caught the secret of another metal still; ’twas made by so compounding several metals, that there stood forth a wondrous slab of lightness and of gloss, on its bright surface, golden slab it seemed, the characters were carven so to represent the objects one might wish to hold in thought, as well as characters denoting time and substance, journeyings, reigns of various kings and deaths of nobles, criminals. All writ so fair upon the gleaming stuff by chiseling, and pleasure brought to science's laws and rules could never be surpassed.</p>  
 <p>This metal wore not neither rusted, nor yet cleft in particles, but stood superb throughout the ages; aye, ye could see it still if ye, perchance, could raise the block of stone which means the temple wall; and lying prone, or standing where first set would be this tablet; aye, would hundreds be as as fair as any page from master's hand today.</p>  
 <p>Components for "cement," ye speak, were understood as now, and firm and smoothe rose many a palace wall made of the sand and slime—"bitumen," ye. Pebbles were, too, employed in building. Of colors unknown to you cold people of the North. Aye, shells so turned by flexity of carbon gas that stone they seemed and set in pillars’-walls. The secret of the priesthood, understood by few, to crystallize or "petrify" all things of nature. None that secret took to Egypt, lost.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_47"><font size="1" color="green">p. 47</font></a></p>  
 <p>Aye, even blossoms could they so solidify. A difficult but certain task to them who understood; and these, too, live beneath the feet of things that walk and swim—the monsters of the deep.</p>  
 <p>"Sea onion" made in cups like ivory seemed when petrified. The "kelp" they wove in nets so strong a "shark" could scarcely rend. Aye, dipped in liquid made by science's rules made perfect in its toughening quality, retaining color, shape, the all which nature gave with added worth.</p>  
 <p>From bones of certain fish—the "shark," the "gar," they made them weapons in the early-crudest age; such ivory as ye seldom see because the seeming, worthless bones by simple method long ago employed. A bath in nitrate was compounded, though they who made knew not a name for that one simple liquid of which their fathers held the knowledge since earliest dawn of race.</p>  
 <p>A bath in sunshine, laid on rock which held a property those men of earliest dawn ne’er knew held values, but a certain instinct told them of its worth to harden when in contact with another, foreign matter. Such the work of earlier and of later day that held the hands and minds of old Atlantis’ sons.</p>  
 <p>A happy custom sprang to life in that past day—the custom of so reaping sound from out the "silence," ye, that melody was brought to ear.</p>  
 <p>Old instruments are found today which people know not nor can speak their use, and little dream they gleaned the strong, vibrative force of Nature's laws which are exact and reproduction sometimes a work that art may win. The tissue, clear and strong as gold, doth melt to Time's hot touch, but shape of frame have ye in "museum," lauded as some great pedestal, staff, "the origin of looms," perhaps, but never music instrument. Yet so it was.</p>  
 <p>When breezes strong, salt and full charged with</p>  
 <p><a name="page_48"><font size="1" color="green">p. 48</font></a></p>  
 <p>deep vibrations borne from far in circles, as vibrations trend, smote the sheet of luminated composition—silk and metal particles—they made a rhythmic melody of worth which sages studied to determine storm forecast or fate of sun-smote country, passing of a storm upon the desert, peoples on a raid, the nearness of a foe, while all swung to a tune remote or near as circles broken did denote the foreign body in the rhythmic whirl of vibratory coil; for Circle is Eternity! Great master stroke! Completeness.</p>  
 <p>These the words that God doth change by naught in Nature nor through all His laws!</p>  
 <p>A simple mind determined all for man to ponder on. The son of statesman sitting where the shade made happy bower, had watched the waves and drawn from out the mind realm, through the eye, a force of wondrous discernment, power. The structure which he builded, with the help of sage, to catch the circle's action long did want completion.</p>  
 <p>Suddenly, at dawn the sunlight on the water made the mark that smote the power with which to grasp, and all was plain to him.</p>  
 <p>Ellipse of light. The motes of atmosphere. The current on the dampened surface of the sheets of glass took form before his eyes. The science of ellipse of sound was born! Made perfect by a law well known to mariners of steering by the gurgle of the waves ’gainst rock. A tongue all nature owns.</p>  
 <p>Discernment taught them then the proper stuff to weave to catch the sound <i>in form</i>. Attraction well was studied, and the shape born in their mind was emulated. Circle made of floss so delicate it seemed the gossamer of the spider's house, yet strength was there. A metal in the sand which made the glass soon told its certain worth by testing.</p>  
 <p>Strands of glass enwoven with the silk—a sensitive</p>  
 <p><a name="page_49"><font size="1" color="green">p. 49</font></a></p>  
 <p>to sound which draws (casts) atmosphere and <i>dryness</i> points to <i>source</i>. A movement breaks the rhythm, ear well trained catches the weight of volume—shape of volume—thus the law is read. Long years of study taught the distance. Near, a medley; far a rhythmic murmur of the chords, the distance for such sounds did he determine by examination.</p>  
 <p>Sent he boats afar or near which brought to bear a clang of shields and spears, great shouting, all that might disturb, and when the record smote the sheet enwound about a staff of glass he marked the distance to the point where rested fleet, and thus determined distance readily.</p>  
 <p>The men of that lost land were thinkers. Thought is born in brain which long doth feel the pressure of a word spake with a grain of wisdom; thus it holdeth meaning on which pondering bringeth great results, for like all growths it clingeth to the source, and Source is nurtured in the lap of Age, and thus doth drink of substance which promotes a germ that breeds yet other thoughts that makes a garland of the knowledge scattered through the matter of a mind.</p>  
 <p>And so it was those men of "lost Atlantis" learned to fashion instrument to cast their thoughts by delving into matter of the brain; it drew such atoms as did smite and yet again cast forth the word to them who waited.</p>  
 <p>Suddenly the thought did come to one who long had delved in brain-lore, its forces, all that makes a stroke of will of other methods; for a stroke of thought can give a world of power to them who dwell on thought as force—as factor in the world on which ye bide—on planets where thy kind, yet wholly not thy kind, do live a life of nearness to the Source—to breadth—to Scope—to lightness of the</p>  
 <p><a name="page_50"><font size="1" color="green">p. 50</font></a></p>  
 <p>heart which is the spring of Form set in a model made from molecules condensed and cell besprinkled, yet with purpose, law and reason.</p>  
 <p>Nurtured through the ages by that great Force which is the Spring of Life that buildeth worlds and maketh moods from out the work-shop of a Mind so vast that it doth hold the great immensity of "space" within its bounds. And like the insects swarming round seem planets, world, the All.</p>  
 <p>The law is simple in its workings, but, ah man! Ah, man! the spring is set to beatings of a Heart that grew when Time was not! A Heart that casteth life-blood to the million, million arteries of the world! That checketh not the beatings of the hearts of men by aught that is amiss, but is so well attuned to laws of growth that all may live, but in that vaster Life.</p>  
 <p>That Life so vast, so full of mystery to thee that thou hast cast the thought from out thy puny mind as something harassing and fraught with woe; and yet the mind rejecting is attuned and liveth in the fullness and the warmth of that so well attuned and perfect Heart.</p>  
 <p>The law of the beginning none may know; but law of Life on ether planes we drink, who stand bereft of "body" and where mind and shape of soul are formed of ether-force magnetic, which may pierce all substances and yet be soft to feel the moods of sadness in the one it loves.</p>  
 <p>It penetrates the brain with sense of brain to thee unseen, and yet, that force of brain unseen by eye is stronger far than bands of brass ye weave! And ye, who by the flesh are bound to earth, may drink the higher knowledge through the soul, if so ye live the Soul is recognized and questioned as a thing apart from Mind.</p>  
 <p>All better promptings cometh from the soul. All</p>  
 <p><a name="page_51"><font size="1" color="green">p. 51</font></a></p>  
 <p>evil whispers are the lower self, yet welded are the soul and earth-mind, kin, and yet are severed by the sense of God, ye call for want of name to designate the vast—the mighty—all pervading Force, which entereth every form born from the womb of mother. Blessed state, for she is co-creator, nurturer with the One we name with reverence and awe.</p>  
 <p>That One so subtly held to self yet casting out the sparks of Life and Knowledge. Growth and reason's flow, yet ne’er depleted. Wondrous birth of Time and forces which we read not, yet they lie about us giving unto each a spray of force.</p>  
 <p>Not in fullest power doth Nature fill the form of man, else Man were but a senseless block whose shape and subtle sense, attuned to law of growth alone, were all his heritage, but atoms rarefied build up the form which is the plan of soul. These atoms hold the essence of a Life. God-All-in greatest portion.</p>  
 <p>Such is Man. Built of the sentient matter from the stars—the work of sunbeams—ether held in leash by strong electric force. Of tide-play of the Moon the creature formed from stroke of Potency which lies within its center and its growth-realms.</p>  
 <p>Such is Man—the man of clay, all imbued with life which is the motive force. The Soul—that subtle spring which beateth out the numbered days and years, and draws to higher Soul by love inborn through its soul-birth, biddeth man to hold the thought that divine himself is he, and that he may drink the nectar of the thither spheres which bringeth strength to soul.</p>
