 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 20th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called KHR</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font size="6"> </font></p>
 <p>The dew that was upon the face of the stone is gone, and it is become like 
   a pool of clear golden water. And now the light is come into the Rosy Cross. 
   Yet all that I see is the night, with the stars therein, as they appear through 
   a telescope<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. And there 
   cometh a peacock<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> into 
   the stone, filling the whole Aire. It is like the vision called the Universal 
   Peacock, or, rather, like a representation of that vision. And now there are 
   countless clouds of white angels<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a> filling the Aire as the peacock 
   dissolves. </p>
 <p>Now behind the angels are archangels with trumpets. These cause all things 
   to appear at once, so that there is a tremendous confusion of images. And now 
   I perceive that all these things are but veils of the wheel, for they all gather 
   themselves<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a> into a wheel<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a> 
   that spins with incredible velocity. It hath many colours, but all thrilled 
   with white light, so that they are transparent and luminous. This one wheel 
   is forty-nine wheels, set at different angles, so that they compose a sphere; 
   each wheel has forty-nine spokes, and has forty-nine<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a> 
   concentric tyres at equal distances from the centre. And wherever the rays from 
   any two wheels meet, there is a blinding flash of glory. It must be understood 
   that though so much detail is visible in the wheel, yet at the same time the 
   impression is of a single, simple object. </p>
 <p>It seems that this wheel is being spun by a hand<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. Though the wheel 
   fills the whole Aire, yet the hand is much bigger than the wheel. And though 
   this vision is so great and splendid, yet there is no seriousness with it, or 
   solemnity. It seems that the hand is spinning the wheel merely for pleasure, 
   it would be better to say amusement. </p>
 <p>A voice comes: For he is a jocund and a ruddy god, and his laughter is the 
   vibration of all that exists, and the earthquakes of the soul. </p>
 <p>One is conscious of the whirring of the wheel thrilling one, like an electric 
   discharge passing through one. </p>
 <p>Now I see the figures on the wheel, which have been interpreted as the sworded 
   Sphinx, Hermanubis and Typhon<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. And that is wrong. 
   The rim of the wheel is a vivid emerald snake; in the centre of the wheel is 
   a scarlet heart; and, impossible to explain as it is, the scarlet of the heart 
   and the green of the snake are yet more vivid than the blinding white brilliance 
   of the wheel<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>The figures on the wheel are darker than the wheel itself; in fact, they are 
   stains upon the purity of the wheel, and for that reason, and because of the 
   whirling of the wheel, I cannot see them. But at the top seems to be the Lamb 
   and Flag, such as one sees on some Christian medals, and one of the lower things 
   is a wolf, and the other a raven. The Lamb and Flag symbol is much brighter 
   than the other two. It keeps on growing brighter, until now it is brighter than 
   the wheel itself, and occupies more space than it did. </p>
 <p>It speaks: I am the greatest of the deceivers, for my purity and innocence 
   shall seduce the pure and innocent, who but for me should come to the centre 
   of the wheel<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. The wolf betrayeth 
   only the greedy and the treacherous; the raven betrayeth only the melancholy 
   and the dishonest <a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. 
   But I am he of whom it is written: He shall deceive the very elect. </p>
 <p>For in the beginning the Father of all called forth lying spirits that they 
   might sift the creatures of the earth in three sieves, according to the three 
   impure souls. And he chose the wolf for the lust of the flesh, and the raven 
   for the lust of the mind; but me did he choose above all to simulate the pure 
   prompting of the soul<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
   Them that are fallen a prey to the wolf and the raven I have not scathed; but 
   them that have rejected me, I have given over to the wrath of the raven and 
   the wolf<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. And the jaws 
   of the one have torn them, and the beak of the other has devoured the corpse. 
   Therefore is my flag white, because I have left nothing upon the earth alive. 
   I have feasted myself on the blood of the saints, but I am not suspected of 
   men to be their enemy, for my fleece is white and warm, and my teeth are not 
   the teeth of one that teareth flesh; and mine eyes are mild, and they know me 
   not the chief of the lying spirits that the Father of all sent forth from before 
   his face in the beginning<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>(His attribution is salt; the wolf mercury, and the raven sulphur<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>.) 
 </p>
 <p>Now the lamb grows small again, there is again nothing but the wheel, and the 
   hand that whirleth it. </p>
 <p>And I said: "By the word of power, double in the voice of the Master; 
   by the word that is seven, and one in seven; and by the great and terrible word 
   210<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>, I beseech thee, 
   O my Lord, to grant me the vision of thy glory." And all the rays of the 
   wheel stream out at me, and I am blasted and blinded with the light. I am caught 
   up into the wheel. I am one with the wheel. I am greater than the wheel<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. 
   In the midst of a myriad lightnings I stand, and I behold his face. (I am thrown 
   violently back on to the earth every second, so that I cannot quite concentrate.) 
 </p>
 <p>All one gets is a liquid flame of pale gold. But its radiant force keeps hurling 
   me back. </p>
 <p>And I say: By the word and the will, by the penance and the prayer, let me 
   behold thy face. (I cannot explain this, there is confusion of personalities.) 
   I who speak to you, see what I tell you; but I, who see him, cannot communicate 
   it to me, who speak to you<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>If one could gaze upon the sun at noon, that might be like the substance of 
   him. But the light is without heat. It is the vision of Ut<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a> 
   in the Upanishads. And from this vision have come all the legends of Bacchus 
   and Krishna and Adonis<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. For the impression is of a youth 
   dancing and making music. But you must understand that he is not doing that, 
   for he is still<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. 
   Even the hand that turns the wheel is not his hand, but only a hand energized 
   by him. </p>
 <p>And now it is the dance of Shiva. I lie beneath his feet, his saint, his victim<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. 
   My form is the form of the God Phtah<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>, in my essence, but the form of 
   the god Seb in my form<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. And this is the reason of existence, 
   that in this dance which is delight, there must needs be both the god and the 
   adept. Also the earth herself is a saint; and the sun and the moon dance upon 
   her, torturing her with delight. </p>
 <p>This vision is not perfect. I am only in the outer court of the vision, because 
   I have undertaken it in the service of the Holy One, and must retain sense and 
   speech<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. No recorded 
   vision is perfect, of high visions, for the seer must keep either his physical 
   organs or his memory in working order. And neither is capable. There is no bridge. 
   One can only be conscious of one thing at a time, and as the consciousness moves 
   nearer to the vision, it loses control of the physical and mental. Even so, 
   the body and the mind must be very perfect before anything can be done, or the 
   energy of the vision may send the body into spasms and the mind into insanity. 
   This is why the first visions give Ananda, which is a shock. When the adept 
   is attuned to Samadhi, there is but cloudless peace<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>This vision is particularly difficult to get into, because he is I<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. 
   And therefore the human ego is being constantly excited, so that one comes back 
   so often. An acentric meditation practice like mahasatipatthana ought to be 
   done before invocations of the Holy Guardian Angel, so that the ego may be very 
   ready to yield itself utterly to the Beloved. </p>
 <p>And now the breeze is blowing about us, like the sighs of love unsatisfied 
   --- or satisfied. His lips move<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. I cannot say 
   the words at first. </p>
 <p>And afterwords: "Shalt thou not bring the children of men to the sight 
   of my glory<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>? 'Only thy silence and thy speech 
   that worship me avail.' 'For as I am the last, so am I the next, and as the 
   next shalt thou reveal me to the multitude<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>.' 
   Fear not for aught; turn not aside for aught, eremite of Nuit, apostle of Hadit, 
   warrior of Ra Hoor Khu! The leaven taketh, and the bread shall be sweet; the 
   ferment worketh, and the wine shall be sweet. My sacraments are vigorous food 
   and divine madness. Come unto me, O ye children of men; come unto me, in whom 
   I am, in whom ye are, were ye only alive with the life that abideth in Light." 
 </p>
 <p>All this time I have been fading away. I sink. The veil of night comes down 
   a dull blue-gray with one pentagram in the midst of it, watery and dull. And 
   I am to abide there for a while before I come back to the earth<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. 
   (But shut me the window up, hide me from the sun. Oh, shut the window!)<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a> 
 </p>
 <p>Now, the pentagram is faded; black crosses fill the Aethyr gradually growing 
   and interlacing, until there is a network. </p>
 <p>It is all dark now. I am lying exhausted<a href="#34"><font size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>, with the sharp edge of the shew-stone 
   cutting into my forehead. </p>
 <p>Bou-Sada.<br>

   <li><a name="1"></a><font size="2">KHR = {Dee}{Air}{Gemini} = {HEB:Shin}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Vau} 
     = 308. (N.B. by Temurah, R.H.K. = Ra-Hoor-Khuit). 308 = 28 x 11. 28 = {HEB:Chet} 
     {HEB:Koph} = {Cancer}{Jupiter} (Jupiter is exalted in Cancer) means Power. 
     And 29 is the "mystic number" of Netzach, Victory, the Sephira that 
     hangs from the Sphere of Jupiter, by the path of Jupiter, Atu X, the Wheel 
     of Fortune. This Atu is the main subject of the vision in this Aethyr. In 
     this Aethyr the Solar Body (Ruach --- the human consciousness) of the Seer 
     was prepared for the Great Initiation which follows, as in the 27th Aire his 
     Lunar Body (Nephesch --- automatic Consciousness) was purified.</font></li>
   <li><a name="2"></a><font size="2">These preliminary visions are veils.</font></li>
   <li><a name="3"></a><font size="2">The bird sacred to Juno, the feminine counterpart 
     of Jupiter, whose Energy is about to appear.</font></li>
   <li><a name="4"></a><font size="2">The Chasmalim, "The brilliant ones", 
     are the Chior of Angels which pertain to Jupiter.</font></li>
   <li><a name="5"></a><font size="2">This unification is necessary to all true 
     comprehension. </font></li>
   <li><a name="6"></a><font size="2">The Wheel of Fortune (so called); Atu X is 
     the Wheel of the Samsara whose spokes are the Three Gunas, the three fundamental 
     Modes of Energy, Sattvas, Rajas, and Tamas. See also <em>Book of Lies</em>, 
     Cap. 78. </font></li>
   <li><a name="7"></a><font size="2">The symbolism of the Table (see 22nd Aire) 
     still retains its prominence. 7 is the number of the Inferiors, of the Feminine 
     Perfection. 3 x 49 = 147 = {HEB:Heh} {HEB:Vau} {HEB:Heh} {HEB:Yod} + {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Aleph} 
     + {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Lamed} {HEB:Gemel}{HEB:Aleph} + {HEB:Yod}{HEB:Nun}{HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Aleph} 
     = the Four Names of god used in the Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram. Thus there 
     is here the symbolism of the Fourfold Regimen (Tetragrammaton) implied in 
     3 x 7 x 7.</font></li>
   <li><a name="8"></a><font size="2">Hand = {HEB:Yod} = {HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Yod} 
     = 20 = K = 4. But also the first is itself K. There is, however, an esoteric 
     doctrine in this phrase. {HEB:Yod} is the spermatozoon, the source of all 
     Spiritual Energy, the Minute Point, Hadit, the foundation of the Alphabet, 
     (Hebrew). But also K = {HEB:Peh-final}{HEB:Koph} = 100 = 10 x 10 = {HEB:Yod} 
     x {HEB:Yod}; and K and P are the initials of Ketis and {GRK:theta} {GRK:alpha} 
     {GRK:lambda} {GRK:lambda}{GRK:omicron}{GRK:sigma} whose union releases {HEB:Yod}. 
     Thus the Universe is shown as being set in motion by Love under Will. See 
     <em>Book of Lies</em>, Cap. 43.</font></li>
   <li><a name="9"></a><font size="2">See the usual drawing of Atu X by minor initiates.</font></li>
   <li><a name="10"></a><font size="2">The symbolism here assumes the form of <em>Liber 
     LXV</em>. It is simpler and therefore more difficult than the sevenfold. The 
     counter charges become more frequent; the Seer is being led up to the state 
     in which opposites are not only equal, but identical. </font></li>
   <li><a name="11"></a><font size="2">All unbalanced symbols are necessarily evil. 
     They distract the attention from the true object of Vision, and so destroy 
     Concentration.</font></li>
   <li><a name="12"></a><font size="2">Note that no hostile force is hurtful. The 
     enemy is always oneself.</font></li>
   <li><a name="13"></a><font size="2">The attacks are against Nephesch, Ruach, 
     and Neshama respectively. </font></li>
   <li><a name="14"></a><font size="2">When the aspiration (Neshama), the natural 
     protection against all lower forces, is sullied, befooled, or weakened, the 
     wretch becomes an easy prey to grosser forms of temptation. We see in fact 
     only too often that a man of the utmost probity and intellectual integrity, 
     who errs in some strictly spiritual matter, lose every trace of rationality, 
     and throw off all moral restraint, becoming the helpless victim of ludicrous 
     and hideous temptations which had never threatened him before in his whole 
     life. His nature is so radically corrupted that his friends believe him to 
     have become insane. But his fall is quite logical, as a tumbling steeple may 
     crush the perfectly sound structures beneath it.</font></li>
   <li><a name="15"></a><font size="2">It is the superficial appeal of the idea 
     of "Jesus" to the sentimental type of aspiration (the vilest parody 
     of Neschamah is this pollution by the least virile elements of Nephesh) that 
     has made possible the corruption implied in the doctrines of Sin and Vicarious 
     Atonement. From this error have sprung the putrefaction of the reasoning faculties, 
     and the suppression of all clear thinking, and the abominations of greed, 
     persecution and the rest. </font></li>
   <li><a name="16"></a><font size="2">{Salt} for Neschamah; {Mercury} for Ruach; 
     {Sulphur} for Nephesch.</font></li>
   <li><a name="17"></a><font size="2">N.O.X. = {HEB:Tzaddi}{HEB:Ayin}{HEB:Nun} 
     = 210. {Earth} represents the reduction of the Dyad to Unity by Love under 
     Will, and thence to 0 by dissolution in Nuit. It is here used by the Seer 
     to destroy all positive symbols, for the true Wheel (apart from ornaments) 
     is the circle, Nuit Herself.</font></li>
   <li><a name="18"></a><font size="2">Note the above-the-Abyss-consciousness. 
     Cf. "I who am all, and made it all, abide its separate Lord." (Bhagavad 
     Gita)</font></li>
   <li><a name="19"></a><font size="2">This personality-paradox is characteristic 
     of visions of similar exaltation. It constitutes an essential difficulty of 
     expression superadded to that natural to the description of things seen and 
     heard, which are yet not subject to the ordinary Laws of perception.</font></li>
   <li><a name="20"></a><font size="2">See previous note on Falutli.</font></li>
   <li><a name="21"></a><font size="2">These are Solar, not Jupiterian deities. 
     The Jupiter of the Wheel is that Invisible Energy, whom one can only divine 
     from his Hand, his means of Expression. He is Amoun, the Concealed One, whose 
     plumes are Truth, and whose Phallus is the Middle Pillar, the Shivalingam. 
     We hind accordingly that these Solar Deities, who spring from the manifested 
     Jupiter (as it at first sight appears) are soon recognized in their deeper 
     nature. </font></li>
   <li><a name="22"></a><font size="2">Change = Stability. 2x = 9{square x}. See 
     the 11th Aethyr. Again this series of paradoxes (implied in the equations 
     0x = 0{square x}, 1x = 10{squarex}, etc.) is of the essence of the Aire.</font></li>

     with, His Kether.</font></li>
   <li><a name="26"></a><font size="2">See note 5, page 44. Any vision as exalted 
     as this must obviously be indicible. The plastic form of the expression, the 
     definite character of the shapes, colours, and numbers employed, is far better 
     mnemonically than the vaguely beatific outbursts customary in the records 
     usually offered by Mystics.</font></li>

     has always been peculiar to his Aire. Even in ZAA, where the Angel is Luna, 
     and the Vision represents the lustration of the Lunar Body (the Automatic 
     Consciousness) of the Seer, He was not so wholly involved. For his normal 
     consciousness was above that which the Aethyr affected. </font></li>
   <li><a name="29"></a><font size="2">It seems that the seer recognized in this 
     Aethyr, the Knowledge and Conversation of His Holy Guardian Angel.</font></li>

     ("The Temple Of Solomon the King", <em>Equinox</em> I, No. Viii, 
     pp. 9-13) during his Burma-China journey, he accomplished the meditation called 
     Sammasati. He became aware of his True Will, of the purpose for which he had 
     undertaken Incarnation. And this was expressed thus: to aid Mankind to take 
     the Next Step. And at the time he understood this as meaning: to lead them 
     to aspire to the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.</font></li>
