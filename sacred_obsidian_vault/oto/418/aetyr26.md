 <h1 align="center"><strong>The Cry of the 26th Aethyr, <br>
         Which is Called DES</strong><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></h1>
         <p>There is a very bright pentagram: and now the stone is
         gone, and the whole heaven is black, and the blackness is
         the blackness of a mighty angel<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. And though he is
         black (his face and his wings and his robe and his armour
         are all black), yet is he so bright that I cannot look
         upon him. And he cries: O ye spears and vials of poison
         and sharp swords and whirling thunderbolts that are about
         the corners of the earth<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>,
         girded with wrath and justice, know ye that His name is
         Righteousness in Beauty<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>?
         Burnt out are your eyes, for that ye have seen me in my
         majesty. And broken are the drum-heads of your ears<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>,
         because my name is as two mountains of fornication, the
         breasts of a strange woman<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>;
         and my Father is not in them. </p>
         <p>Lo! the pools of fire and torment mingled with
         sulphur! Many are their colours, and their colour is as
         molten gold, when all is said. Is not He one, one and
         alone, in whom the brightness of your countenance is as
         1,728 petals of fire<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>.
         </p>
         <p>Also he spake the curse, folding his wings across and
         crying: Is not the son the enemy of his father? And hath
         not the daughter stolen the warmth of the bed of her
         mother<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>?
         therefore is the great curse irrevocable. Therefore there
         is neither wisdom nor understanding nor knowledge in this
         house, that hangeth upon the edge of hell<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. Thou art not 4
         but 2, O thou blasphemy spoken against 1<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. </p>
         <p>Therefore whoso worshippeth thee is accursed. He shall
         be brayed in a mortar and the powder thereof cast to the
         winds, that the birds of the air may eat thereof and die;
         and he shall be dissolved in strong acid and the elixir
         poured into the sea, that the fishes of the sea may
         breathe thereof and die. And he shall be mingled with
         dung and spread upon the earth, so that the herbs of the
         earth may feed thereof and die; and he shall be burnt
         utterly with fire, and the ashes thereof shall calcine
         the children of flame, that even in hell may be found an
         overflowing lamentation. </p>
         <p>And now on the breast of the Angel is a golden egg
         between the blackness of the wings, and that egg<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>
         grows and grows all over the aethyr. And it breaks, and
         within there is a golden eagle. </p>
         <p>And he cries: Woe! woe! woe! Yea, woe unto the world!
         For there is no sin, and there is no salvation<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>.
         My plumes are like waves of gold upon the sea. My eyes
         are brighter than the sun. My tongue is swifter than the
         lightning. </p>
         <p>Yet am I hemmed in by the armies of night, singing,
         singing phrases unto Him that is smitten by the
         thunderbolt of the abyss. Is not the sky clear behind the
         sun? These clouds that burn thee up, these rays that
         scorch the brains of men with blindness; these are
         heralds before my face of the dissolution and the night. </p>
         <p>Ye are all blinded by my glory; and though ye treasure
         in your heart the sacred word that is the last lever of
         the key to the little door beyond the abyss, yet ye gloss
         and comment thereupon; for the light itself is but
         illusion. Truth itself is but illusion. Yea, these be the
         great illusions beyond life and space and time. </p>
         <p>Let thy lips blister with my words! Are they not
         meteors in thy brain? Back, back from the face of the
         accursed one, who am I; back into the night of my father,
         into the silence; for all that ye deem right is left,
         forward is backward, upward is downward<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. </p>
         <p>I am the great god adored of the holy ones. Yet am I
         the accursed one, child of the elements and not their
         father<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>.
         </p>
         <p>O my mother! wilt thou not have pity upon me? Wilt
         thou not shield me? For I am naked, I am manifest, I am
         profane. O my father! wilt not thou withdraw me? I am
         extended, I am double, I am profane. </p>
         <p>Woe, woe unto me! These are they that hear not prayer.
         It is I that have heard all prayer alway, and there is
         none to answer <em>me</em>. Woe unto me! Woe unto me!
         Accursed am I unto the aeons! All this time this
         brilliant eagle-headed god has been attacked, seemingly,
         by invisible people<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>,
         for he is wounded now and again, here and there; little
         streams of fresh blood come out over the feathers of his
         breast. And the smoke of the blood is gradually filling
         the Aethyr with a crimson veil. There is a scroll over
         the top, saying: <em>Ecclesia abhorret a sanguine</em><a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>;
         and there is another scroll below it in a language of
         which I do not know the sounds. The meaning is, Not as
         they have understood<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>.
         </p>
         <p>The blood is thicker and darker now, and it is
         becoming clotted and black, so that everything is blotted
         out; because it coagulates, coagulates. And then at the
         top there steals a dawn of pure night- blue <a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>, --- Oh, the
         stars, the stars in it deeply set! --- and drives the
         blood down; so that all round the top of the oval
         gradually dawns the figure of our Lady Nuit, and beneath
         her is the flaming winged disk, and below the altar of
         Ra-Hoor-Khuit, even as it is upon the Stele of Revealing<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>.
         But below is the supine figure of Seb, into whom is
         concentrated all that clotted blood<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
         <p>And there comes a voice: It is the dawn of the aeon.
         The aeons of cursing are passed away. Force and fire,
         strength and sight, these are for the servants of the
         Star and the Snake. </p>
         <p>And now I seem to be lying in the desert, exhausted<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>.
         </p>
