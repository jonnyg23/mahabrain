 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 2nd Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called ARN</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>In the first place, there is again the woman riding on the bull, which is the 
   reflection of BABALON, that rideth on The Beast. And also there is an Assyrian 
   legend of a woman with a fish, and also there is a legend of Eve and the Serpent, 
   for Cain was the the child of Eve and the Serpent, and not of Eve and Adam; 
   and therefore when he had slain his brother, who was the first murderer, having 
   sacrificed living things to his demon, had Cain the mark upon his brow, which 
   is the mark of the Beast spoken of in the Apocalypse, and is the sign of initiation<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>The shedding of blood is necessary, for God did not hear the children of Eve 
   until blood was shed<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. And that is external religion; 
   but Cain spake not with God, nor had the mark of initiation upon his brow, so 
   that he was shunned by all men, until he had shed blood. And this blood was 
   the blood of his brother. This is a mystery of the sixth key of the Taro, which 
   ought not to be called The Lovers, but The Brothers<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>In the middle of the card stands Cain; in his right hand is the Hammer of Thor 
   with which he hath slain his brother, and it is all wet with his blood. And 
   his left hand he holdeth open as a sign of innocence. And on his right hand 
   is his mother Eve, around whom the serpent is entwined with his hood spread 
   behind her head; and on his left hand is a figure somewhat like the Hindoo Kali, 
   but much more seductive. Yet I know it to be Lilith. And above him is the Great 
   Sigil of the Arrow, downward, but it is struck through the heart of the child. 
   This Child is also Abel<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
   And the meaning of this part of the card is obscure, but that is the correct 
   drawing of the Taro card; and that is the correct magical fable from which the 
   Hebrew scribes, who were not complete Initiates, stole their legend of the Fall 
   and the subsequent events. They joined different fables together to try and 
   make a connected story, and they sophisticted them to suit their sociall and 
   political conditions. </p>
 <p>All this while no image hath come unto the Stone, and no voice hath been heard. 
 </p>
 <p>I cannot get any idea of the source of what I have been saying. All I can say 
   is, that there is a sort of dew, like mist, upon the Stone, and yet it has become 
   hot to the touch<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>All I get is that the Apocalypse was the recension of a dozen or so totally 
   disconnected allegories, that were pieced together, and ruthlessly planed down 
   to make them into a connected account; and that recension was re-written and 
   edited in the interests of Christianity, because people were complaining that 
   Christianity could show no true spiritual knowledge, or any food for the best 
   minds: nothing but miracles, which only deceived the most ignorant, and Theology, 
   which only suited pedants. </p>
 <p>So a man got hold of this recension, and turned it Christian, and imitated 
   the style of John.<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a> And this explains why the end of 
   the world does not happen every few years, as advertised<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>There is nothing whatever in the Stone but a White Rose. And a voice comes: 
   there shall be no more red roses, for she hath crushed all the blood of all 
   things into her cup. </p>
 <p>It seemed at one time as if the rose was in the breast of a beautiful woman, 
   high-bosomed, tall, stately, yet who danced like a snake. But there was no subsistence 
   in this vision<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And now I see the white Rose, as if it were in the beak of a swan, in the picture 
   by Michael Angelo in Venice. And that legend too is the legend of BABALON. </p>
 <p>But all this is before the veil of the Aethyr. Now will I go and make certain 
   preparations<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>, and I will return and repeat 
   the call of the Aethyr yet again. </p>
 <p>Biskra.<br>
   December 18, 1909. 9:20 - 10:5 a.m. </p>
 <p>It is not a question of being unable to get into the Aethyr, and trying to 
   struggle through; but one is not anywhere near it<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>A voice comes: When thy dust shall strew the earth whereon She walketh, then 
   mayest thou bear the impress of Her foot. And thou thinkest to behold Her face! 
 </p>
 <p>The Stone is become of the most brilliant whiteness, and yet, in that whiteness, 
   all the other colours are implicit<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. 
   The colour of anything is but its dullness, its obstructiveness. So is it with 
   these visions. All that they <em>are</em> is falsity. Every idea merely marks 
   where the mind of the Seer was too stupid to receive the light, and therefore 
   reflected it. Therefore, as the pure light is colourless, so is the pure soul 
   black<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And this is the Mystery of the incest of CHAOS with his daughter<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>There is nothing whatever visible. </p>
 <p>But I asked of the Angel that is at my side if the ceremony hath been duly 
   performed. And he says: Yes, the Aethyr is present. It is thou that canst not 
   perceive it, even as I cannot perceive it, because it is so entirely beyond 
   thy conception that there is nothing in thy mind on to which it can cast a symbol, 
   even as the emptiness of space is not heated by the fire of the sun. And so 
   pure is the light that it preventeth the formation of images, and therefore 
   have men called it darkness. For with any lesser light, the mind responds, and 
   makes for itself divers palaces<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. 
   It is that which is written: "In my Father's house there are many mansions"; 
   and if the house be destroyed, how much more the mansions that are therein! 
   For this is the victory of BABALON over the Magician that ensorcelled<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a> 
   her. For as the Mother she is 3 by 52, and as the harlot she is 6 by 26; but 
   she is also 12 by 13, and that is the pure unity<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. 
   Moreover she is 4 by 39, that is, victory over the power of the 4, and in 2 
   by 78 hath she destroyed the great Sorcerer<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. 
   Thus is she the synthesis of 1 and 2 and 3 and 4, which being added are 10, 
   therefore could she set her daughter upon her own throne, and defile her own 
   bed with her virginity<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And I ask the Angel if there is any way by which I can make myself worthy to 
   behold the Mysteries of this Aethyr. </p>
 <p>And he saith: It is not in my knowledge. Yet do thou make once more in silence 
   the Call of the Aethyr, and wait patiently upon the favour of the Angel, for 
   He is a mighty Angel, and never yet have I heard the whisper of his wing. </p>
 <p>This is the translation of the Call of the Aethyr<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>O ye heavens which dwell in the first Aire, and are mighty in the parts of 
   the earth, and execute therein the judgment of the highest, to you it is said: 
   Behold the face of your God, the beginning of comfort, whose eyes are the brightness 
   of the heavens which provided you for the government of the earth, and her unspeakable 
   variety, furnishing you with a power of understanding, that ye might dispose 
   all things according to the foresight of Him that sitteth on the Holy Throne, 
   and rose up in the beginning, saying, The earth, let her be governed by her 
   parts (this is the prostitution of BABALON to Pan), and let there be division 
   in her (the formation of the Many from the One), that her glory may be always 
   ecstasy and the irritation of orgasm. Her course let it round with the heavens 
   (that is, let her way be always harmonious with heaven), and as an handmaid 
   let her serve them (that is, the Virgin of Eternity climbing into the bed of 
   CHAOS). One season let it confound another (that is, let there be unwearying 
   variety of predicates)<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>}, and let there be no creature 
   upon or within her the same (that is, let there be an unwearying variety of 
   subjects)<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. All her members let them differ 
   in their qualities, and let there be no one creature<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a> 
   equal with another (for if there were any duplication or omission, there would 
   be no perfection in the whole). The reasonable creatures of the earth and men, 
   let them vex and weed out one another (this is, the destruction of reason by 
   internecine conflicts in the course of redemption). And their dwelling places, 
   let them forget their names. (This is, the arising of Nemo.) The work of man 
   and his pomp, let them be defaced. (That is, in the Great Work man must lose 
   his personality.) His building, let it be a cave for the Beast of the Field. 
   ("His building" means the Vault of the Adepts, and the "Cave" 
   is the Cave of the Mountain of Abiegnus, and the "Beast" is he upon 
   whom BABALON rideth, and the "Field" is the supernal Eden.) Confound 
   her understanding with darkness. (This sentence is explained by what has been 
   said concerning Binah.) For why, it rejoiceth me concerning the Virgin and the 
   Man<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. (Kelly did not 
   understand this Call at all, and he would not believe this sentence was written 
   so, for it seemed to contradict the rest of the Call, so he altered it.) One 
   while let her be known and another while a stranger, (that is, the Mystery of 
   the Holy One being at the same time identical with everything and apart from 
   it), because she is the bed of an harlot, and the dwelling of him that is fallen. 
   (That is that Mystery which was revealed in the last Aethyr; the universe being, 
   as it were, a garden wherein the Holy Ones may take their pleasure.) O ye heavens, 
   arise; the lower heavens beneath you, let them serve you. (This is a command 
   for the whole of things to join in universal rapture.) Govern those that govern; 
   cast down such as fall; bring forth those that increase; and destroy the rotten. 
   (This means that everything shall take its own pleasure in its own way.<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>) No place let 
   it remain in one number. ("No place" is the infinite Ain . . . "Let 
   remain in one number"; that is, let it be concentrated in Kether.) Add 
   and diminish until the stars be numbered. (It is a mystery of the Logos being 
   formulated by the Qabalah, because the stars, are all letters of the Holy Alphabet, 
   as it was said in a former Aethyr.) Arise! Move! and Appear! before the covenant 
   of his mouth which he hath shewn unto us in his Justice. ("The Covenant" 
   is the letter Aleph; "His mouth", pe'; "His Justice", lamed; 
   and these add up again to Aleph, so that it is in the letter Aleph, which is 
   zero, thus symbolizing the circles of the Aethyrs, that he calleth them forth. 
   But men thought that Aleph was the initial ARR, cursing, when it was really 
   the initial of AChD, unity, and AHBH, love. So that it was the most horrible 
   and wicked blasphemy of the blackest of all the black brothers to begin Barashith 
   with a beth, with the letter of the Magician. Yet, by this simple device, hath 
   he created the whole illusion of sorrow.<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>) 
   Open the mysteries of your creation, and make us partakers of the undefiled 
   knowledge. (The word here is "IADNAMAD" is not the ordinary word for 
   knowledge. It is a word of eight letters, which is the secret name of God, summarized 
   in the letter cheth; for which see the Aethyr which correspondeth to that letter, 
   the twelfth Aethyr.<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>) 
 </p>
 <p>Now from time to time I have looked into the Stone, but never is there any 
   image therein, or any hint thereof; but now there are three arrows, arranged 
   thus: </p>
 <p>[Figure here: Three arrows intersecting in the common centers of the three 
   shafts. Two are diagonal, forming an "X" with points to top and fledging 
   to bottom. The third is vertical, bisecting the "X" with point below 
   and fledging to the top.] </p>
 <p>This is the letter Aleph in the Alphabet of Arrows. </p>
 <p>(I want to say that while I was doing the translation of the Call of the Aethyrs, 
   the soles of my feet were burning, as if I were on red hot steel.<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>) </p>
 <p>And now the fire was spread all over me, and parches me, and tortures me. And 
   my sweat is bitter like poison. And all my blood is acrid in my veins, like 
   gleet. I seem to be all festering, rotting; and the worms eating me while I 
   am yet alive. </p>
 <p>A voice, neither in myself nor out of myself, is saying: Remember Prometheus; 
   remember Ixion<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>I am tearing<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a> at 
   nothing. I will not heed. For even this dust<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a> must be consumed 
   with fire. </p>
 <p>And now, although there is no image, at last there is a sense of obstacle, 
   as if one were at length drawing near to the frontier of the Aethyr. </p>
 <p>But I am dying. </p>
 <p>I can neither strive nor wait. There is agony in my ears, and in my throat, 
   and mine eyes have been so long blind that I cannot remember that there ever 
   was such a thing as sight<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And it cometh to me that I should go away, and await the coming of the veil 
   of the Aethyr; not here. I think I will go to the Hot Springs<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>So I put away the Stone upon my breast. </p>
 <p>Biskra<br>
   10:15-11:52 a.m. </p>
 <p>Flashes of lightning are playing in the Stone, at the top; and at the bottom 
   of the Stone there is a black pyramid<a href="#34"><font size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>, 
   and at the top thereof is a vesica piscis. The vesica piscis<a href="#35"><font size="1"><strong>35</strong></font></a> 
   is of colourless brilliance. </p>
 <p>The two curves of Pisces are thus: </p>
 <p>[Figure here: The Pisces sign without the cross-line. In Essence ") (", 
   but larger with thick curves.] </p>
 <p>They are the same curves as the curves of vesica piscis, but turned round<a href="#36"><font size="1"><strong>36</strong></font></a>}. 
 </p>
 <p>And a voice comes: How can that which is buried in the pyramids<a href="#37"><font size="1"><strong>37</strong></font></a> 
   behold that which descendeth unto its apex<a href="#38"><font size="2"><strong>38</strong></font></a>? </p>
 <p>Again it comes to me, without voice: Therefore is motherhood the symbol of 
   the Masters. For first they must give up their virginity to be destroyed, and 
   the seed must lie hidden in them until the nine moons wax and wane, and they 
   must surround it with the Universal Fluid. And they must feed it with the blood 
   for fire. Then is the child a living thing. And afterwards is much suffering 
   and much joy, and after that are they torn asunder, and this is all their thank, 
   that they give it to suck<a href="#39"><font size="1"><strong>39</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>All this while the vision in the Shew-Stone stays as it was, save that the 
   lightning grows more vehement and clear; and behind the vesica piscis is a black 
   cross<a href="#40"><font size="1"><strong>40</strong></font></a> extending to 
   the top and to the edges of the Stone. And now blackness spreads, and swallows 
   up the images. </p>
 <p>Now there is naught but a vast black triangle having the apex downwards<a href="#41"><font size="1"><strong>41</strong></font></a>, 
   and in the centre of the black triangle is the face of Typhon, the Lord of the 
   Tempest, and he crieth aloud: Despair! Despair! For thou mayest deceive the 
   Virgin, and thou mayest cojole the Mother; but what wilt thou say unto the ancient 
   Whore that is throned in Eternity? For if she will not, there is neither force 
   nor cunning, nor any wit, that may prevail upon her. </p>
 <p>Thou canst not woo her with love<a href="#42"><font size="1"><strong>42</strong></font></a>, for she <em>is</em> love. And 
   she hath all, and hath no need of thee. </p>
 <p>And thou canst not woo her with gold<a href="#43"><font size="1"><strong>43</strong></font></a>, for all the Kings and captains 
   of the earth, and all the gods of heaven, have showered their gold upon her. 
   Thus hath she all, and hath no need of thee. </p>
 <p>And thou canst not woo her with knowledge, for knowledge is the thing that 
   she hath spurned<a href="#44"><font size="1"><strong>44</strong></font></a>. She hath it all, and hath no 
   need of thee. </p>
 <p>And thou canst not woo her with wit<a href="#45"><font size="1"><strong>45</strong></font></a>, for her Lord is Wit. </p>
 <p>She hath it all, and hath no need of thee. Despair! Despair! </p>
 <p>Nor canst thou cling to her knees and ask for pity; nor canst thou cling to 
   her heart and ask for love; nor canst thou put thine arms about her neck, and 
   ask for understanding; for thou had all these<a href="#46"><font size="1"><strong>46</strong></font></a>, and they avail thee not. Despair! 
   Despair! </p>
 <p>Then I took the Flaming Sword<a href="#47"><font size="1"><strong>47</strong></font></a>, and I let it loose against Typhon, 
   so that his head was cloven asunder, and the black triangle dissolved in lightnings<a href="#48"><font size="1"><strong>48</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>But as he parted his voice broke out again: Nor canst thou win her with the 
   Sword, for her eyes are fixed upon the eyes of Him in whose hand is the hilt 
   of the Sword<a href="#49"><font size="1"><strong>49</strong></font></a>. Despair! Despair! 
 </p>
 <p>And the echo of that cry was his word, which is identical, although it be diverse: 
   Nor canst thou win her by the Serpent<a href="#50"><font size="1"><strong>50</strong></font></a>, 
   for it was the Serpent that seduced her first. Despair! Despair! </p>
 <p>(Yet he cried thus as he fled:) </p>
 <p>I am Leviathan, the great Lost Serpent of the Sea. I writhe eternally in torment, 
   and I lash the ocean with my tail into a whirlpool of foam that is vemonous 
   and bitter, and I have no purpose. I go no whither. I can neither live nor die. 
   I can but rave and rave in my death agony. I am the Crocodile<a href="#51"><font size="1"><strong>51</strong></font></a> 
   that eateth up the children of men. And through the malice of BABALON I hunger, 
   hunger, hunger. </p>
 <p>All this while the Stone is more inert than ever yet; a thousand times more 
   lifeless than when it is not invoked. Now, when it kindles, it only kindles 
   into its physical beauty. And now upon the face of it is a great black Rose, 
   each of whose petals, though it be featureless, is yet a devil-face. And all 
   the stalks are the black snakes of hell. It is alive, this Rose; a single thought 
   informs it. It comes to clutch, to murder. Yet, because a single thought alone 
   informs it, I have hope therein. </p>
 <p>I think the Rose has a hundred and fifty-six petals, and though it be black, 
   it has the luminous blush<a href="#52"><font size="1"><strong>52</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>There it is, in the midst of the Stone, and I cannot see anyone who wears it. 
 </p>
 <p>Aha! Aha! Aha! Shut out the sight<a href="#53"><font size="1"><strong>53</strong></font></a>! </p>
 <p>Holy, Holy, Holy art thou! </p>
 <p>Light, Life and Love are like three glow-worms at thy feet: the whole universe 
   of stars, the dewdrops on the grass whereon thou walkest! </p>
 <p>I am quite blind<a href="#54"><font size="1"><strong>54</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Thou art Nuit! Strain, strain, strain my whole soul<a href="#55"><font size="1"><strong>55</strong></font></a>! </p>
 <p>A ka dua<br>
   Tuf ur biu<br>
   Bi a'a chefu<br>
   Dudu ner af an nuteru<a href="#56"><font size="1"><strong>56</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Falutli! Falutli<a href="#57"><font size="1"><strong>57</strong></font></a>! 
 </p>
 <p>I cling unto the burning Aethyr like Lucifer that fell through the Abyss, and 
   by the fury of his flight kindled the air. </p>
 <p>And I am Belial, for having seen the Rose upon thy breast, I have denied God. 
 </p>
 <p>And I am Satan! I am Satan! I am cast out upon a burning crag! And the sea 
   boils about the desolation thereof. And already the vultures gather, and feast 
   upon my flesh. </p>
 <p>Yea! Before thee all the most holy is profane, O thou desolator of shrines! 
   O thou falsifier of the oracles of truth! Ever as I went, hath it been thus. 
   The truth of the profane was the falsehood of the Neophyte, and the truth of 
   the Neophyte was the falsehood of the Zelator! Again and again the the fortress 
   mut be battered down! pylon must be over thrown! Again and again must the gods 
   be desecrated! </p>
 <p>And now I lie supine before thee, in terror and abasement. O Purity! O Truth! 
   What shall I say? My tongue cleaveth to my jaws, O thou Medusa that hast turned 
   me to stone! Yet is that stone the stone of the philosophers. Yet is that tongue 
   Hadit. </p>
 <p>Aha! Aha<a href="#58"><font size="1"><strong>58</strong></font></a>! </p>
 <p>Yea! Let me take the form of Hadit<a href="#59"><font size="1"><strong>59</strong></font></a> before thee, and sing: </p>
 <p>A ka dua<br>
   Tuf ur biu<br>
   Bi a'a chefu<br>
   Dudu ner af an nuteru. </p>
 <p>Nuit! Nuit! Nuit! How art thou manifested in this place! This is a Mystery 
   ineffable. And it is mine, and I can never reveal it either to God or to man. 
   It is for thee and me ! </p>
 <p>Aha! Aha! </p>
 <p>A ka dua<br>
   Tuf ur biu<br>
   Bi a'a chefu<br>
   Dudu ner af an nuteru. </p>
 <p>. . . My spirit is no more; my soul is no more. My life leaps out into annihilation! 
 </p>
 <p>A ka dua<br>
   Tuf ur biu<br>
   Bi a'a chefu<br>
   Dudu ner af an nuteru. </p>
 <p>It is the cry of my body! Save me! I have come too close. I have come too close 
   to that which may not be endured. It must awake, the body; it must assert itself. 
 </p>
 <p>It must shut out the Aethyr, or else it is dead. </p>
 <p>Every pulse aches, and beats furiously. Every nerve stings like a serpent. 
   And my skin is icy cold<a href="#60"><font size="1"><strong>60</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Neither God nor man can penetrate the Mystery of the Aethyr. </p>
 <p>(Here the Seer mutters unintelligibly.) </p>
 <p>And even that which understandeth cannot hear its voice. For to the profane 
   the voice of the Neophyte is called silence, and to the Neophyte the voice of 
   the Zelator is called silence. And so ever is it. </p>
 <p>Sight is fire, and is the first angle of the Tablet<a href="#61"><font size="1"><strong>61</strong></font></a>; spirit is hearing, 
   and is the centre thereof; thou, therefore, who art all spirit and fire, and 
   hast no duller elements in thy star; thou art come to sight at the end of thy 
   will. And if thou wilt hear the voice of the Aethyr<a href="#62"><font size="1"><strong>62</strong></font></a>, 
   do thou invoke it in the night, having no other light but the light of the half 
   moon. Then mayest thou hear the voice, though it may be that thou understandeth 
   it not. Yet shall it be a potent spell, whereby thou mayest lay bare the womb 
   of thy understanding to the violence of CHAOS. </p>
 <p>Now, therefore, for the last time, let the veil of the Aethyr be torn. </p>
 <p>Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! Aha! </p>
 <p>A ka dua<br>
   Tuf ur biu<br>
   Bi a'a chefu<br>
   Dudu ner af an nuteru<a href="#63"><font size="1"><strong>63</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . </p>
 <p>This Aethyr must be left unfinished then until the half moon. </p>

 <p>All this is the melody of a flute, very faint and clear. And there is sort 
   of a sub-tinkle of a bell. </p>
 <p>And there is a string instrument, somewhat like a zither. And there is a human 
   voice. </p>
 <p>And the voice comes: this is the Song of the Sphinx, which she singeth ever 
   in the ears of men. </p>
 <p>And it is the song of the syrens. And whoever heareth it is lost<a href="#65"><font size="1"><strong>65</strong></font></a>.

 <p>Silence! the moon ceaseth (her motion),<br>
   That also was sweet<br>
   In the air, in the air, in the air!<br>
   Who Will shall attain!<br>
   Who Will shall attain<br>
   By the Moon, and by Myself, and by the Angel of the Lord! </p>

 <p>Behold the lion-child swimmeth (in the heaven)<br>
   And the moon reeleth: --<br>
   (It is) Thou! (It is) Thou! (It is) Thou!<br>
   Triumph; the Will stealeth away (like a thief),<br>
   The Strong Will that staggered<br>
   Before Ra Hoor Khuit! -- Hadit! -- Nuit! </p>
 <p align="center"><strong>IV</strong> </p>
 <p>To the God OAI<a href="#66"><font size="1"><strong>66</strong></font></a><br>
   Be praise<br>
   In the end and the beginning!<br>
   And may none fall<br>
   Who Will attain<br>
   The Sword, the Balances, the Crown! </p>
 <p>And that which thou hearest is but the dropping of the dews from my limbs, 
   for I dance in the night, naked upon the grass, in shadowy places, by running 
   streams. </p>
 <p>Many are they who have loved the nymphs of the woods, and of the wells, and 
   of the fountains, and of the hills. And of these some were nympholept. For it 
   was not a nymph, but I myself that walked upon the earth taking my pleasure. 
   So also there were many images of Pan, and men adored them, and as a beautiful 
   god he made their olives bear double and their vines increase; but some were 
   slain by the god, for it was I that had woven the garlands about him<a href="#67"><font size="1"><strong>67</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Now cometh a song. </p>
 <p>So sweet is this song that no one could resist it. For in it is all the passionate 
   ache for the moonlight, and the great hunger of the sea, and the terror of desolate 
   places, --- all things that lure men to the unattainable. </p>

 <p align="center"><em>Translation</em> </p>
 <p>I am the harlot that shaketh Death.<br>
   This shaking giveth the Peace of Satiate Lust.<br>
   Immortality jetteth from my skull,<br>
   And music from my vulva.<br>
   Immortality jetteth from my vulva also,<br>
   For my Whoredom is a sweet scent like a seven-stringed instrument,<br>
   Played unto God the Invisible, the all-ruler,<br>
   That goeth along giving the shrill scream of orgasm. </p>
 <p>Every man that hath seen me forgetteth me never, and I appear oftentimes in 
   the coals of the fire, and upon the smooth white skin of woman, and in the constancy 
   of the waterfall, and in the emptiness of deserts and marshes, and upon great 
   cliffs that look seaward; and in many strange places, where men seek me not. 
   And many thousand times he beholdeth me not. And at last I smite myself into 
   him as a vision smiteth into a stone, and whom I call must follow. </p>
 <p>Now I perceive myself standing in a Druid circle, in an immense open plain. 
 </p>
 <p>A whole series of beautiful visions of deserts and sunsets and islands in the 
   sea, green beyond imagination . . . . But there is no subsistence in them<a href="#68"><font size="1"><strong>68</strong></font></a>.</p>
 <p>A voice goes on: this is the holiness of fruitless love and aimless toil. For 
   in doing the thing for the things's sake is concentration, and this is the holiest 
   of them that suit not the means to the end. For therein is faith and sympathy 
   and a knowledge of the true Magick<a href="#69"><font size="1"><strong>69</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Oh my beloved, that fliest in the air like a dove, beware of the falcon! oh 
   my beloved, that springest upon the earth like a gazelle, beware of the lion! 
 </p>
 <p>There are hundreds of visions, trampling over one another. In each one the 
   Angel of the Aethyr is mysteriously hidden. </p>
 <p>Now I will describe the Angel of the Aethyr until the voice begins again. </p>
 <p>He is like one's idea of Sappho and Calypso, and all seductive and deadly things<a href="#70"><font size="1"><strong>70</strong></font></a>; 
   heavy eye-lids, long lashes, a face like ivory, wonderful barbaric jewellery, 
   intensely red lips, a very small mouth, tiny ears, a Grecian face. Over the 
   shoulders is a black robe with a green collar; the robe is spangled with golden 
   stars; the tunic is a pure soft blue. </p>
 <p>Now the whole Aethyr is swallowed up in a forest of unquenchable fire, and 
   fearlessly through it all a show-white eagle flies. And the eagle cries: the 
   house also of death<a href="#71"><font size="1"><strong>71</strong></font></a>. 
   Come away! The volume of the book is open, the Angel waiteth without, for the 
   summer is at hand. Come away! For the Aeon is measured, and thy spans allotted. 
   Come away! For the mighty sounds have entered into every angle<a href="#72"><font size="1"><strong>72</strong></font></a>. And they have 
   awakened the Angels of the Aethyrs that slept these three hundred years<a href="#73"><font size="1"><strong>73</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>For in the Holy letter Shin, that is the Resurrection in the Book of Thoth, 
   that is the Holy Spirit in the Trinity, that is three hundred in the tale of 
   the years<a href="#74"><font size="1"><strong>74</strong></font></a>, hath the tomb 
   been opened, so that this great wisdom might be revealed. </p>
 <p>Come away! For the Second Triad is completed, and there remaineth only the 
   Lord of the Aeon, the Avenger, the Child both Crowned and Conquering, the Lord 
   of the Sword and the Sun, the Babe in the Lotus, pure from his birth, the Child 
   of suffering, the Father of justice, unto whom be the glory throughout all the 
   Aeon<a href="#75"><font size="1"><strong>75</strong></font></a>! </p>
 <p>Come away! For that which was to be accomplished is accomplished, seeing that 
   thou hadst faith unto the end of all. </p>
 <p>In the letter N the Voice of the Aethyr is ended<a href="#76"><font size="1"><strong>76</strong></font></a>. </p>

   <li><a name="1"></a><font size="2">ARN = {Taurus}{Pisces}{Scorpio}. See the 
     allusions to Bull, Fish and Serpent in the first paragraph. But {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Qof}{HEB:Nun} 
     = 156 = BABALON, also here mentioned; and the whole Aethyr is devoted to HER. 
     </font></li>
   <li><a name="2"></a><font size="2">This is the "Third Eye", the "Eye 
     of Shiva", the Pineal Gland, supposed by some anatomists to be a rudimentary 
     eye.</font></li>
   <li><a name="3"></a><font size="2">The "Bloody Sacrifice" is commonly 
     regarded as "Black Magic". But this depends upon the Formula used 
     by the Magician. All taking of life could be reprehensible even though necessary 
     were it not for the Formula of Evolution. One should assume into one's own 
     Being, ceremonially, the whole Karma of the creature slain; thus building 
     it up into a higher organic structure, and thus helping it to fulfill its 
     True Will of Aspiration to a higher Form of Life. This is, of course, a gross 
     and material method of working, but it is the only method available in such 
     cases. The animal is in any case doomed to death, and the most fortunate, 
     the most directly profitable to it, is this immediate translation of its Prana 
     (in an actual ceremony) or the basis of its Prana (in simple consumption at 
     the table) into a living organism of superior type. It is important not to 
     allow this Prana to escape. </font></li>
   <li><a name="4"></a><font size="2">There is another, even more important, attribution 
     of this card.<br>
     The Bowman is the father ({HEB:Yod} of {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh} {HEB:Yod}) 
     and the Man, the Son ({HEB:Vau}). The Women are Isis and Nephthys ({HEB:Heh} 
     and {HEB:Heh} final); and the whole symbolizes a Formula of the Highest Magick, 
     too obscure and too elaborate to treat in this elementary document.</font></li>
   <li><a name="5"></a><font size="2">This child is really Seth, Set, Sol, Hadit. 
     Abel's blood was the seed of this Seth. Remember that Abel = Baal</font></li>
   <li><a name="6"></a><font size="2">"Miracles" of this order constantly 
     occur in the course of operations of Magick. They are by-products.</font></li>
   <li><a name="7"></a><font size="2">There is no question in my mind that this 
     explanation is correct from the viewpoint of profane scholarship. "Angels" 
     who offer absurd theories about material affairs are false elementals who 
     amuse themselves at the expense of the naivet of the would-be- Magician.</font></li>
   <li><a name="8"></a><font size="2">In any case forecasts of the future cannot 
     be made from Qabalistic data, which have nothing to do with terrestrial measures 
     of time; e.g. to say that King Brahmadatta reigned 120,000 years in Benares, 
     only means that he reigned in a manner congruous with the ideas symbolized 
     by 120 and, on a very grand scale, as indicated by the multiplication by 1000.</font></li>
   <li><a name="9"></a><font size="2">The allusion may be to one of those who occupied 
     for a time the post of "Scarlet Woman". See <em>Book 4</em>, part 
     4, for a list of these women. (Note. - A.C. pencilled in the margin of his 
     <em>Eqx.</em> here "Myriam Deroxe?" Opposite the next paragraph 
     re. the white Rose he annotated "Leila Waddell?" </font></li>
   <li><a name="10"></a><font size="2">In fact, the Seer was the prey of an intolerable 
     uneasiness akin to fear. He was intuitively aware of the terrific nature of 
     the Aethyr, and felt oppressed by the responsibility of seeing and hearing 
     accurately in a manner of such dread importance. He felt even before penetrating 
     the Aire, that he was already near the limit of his powers.</font></li>
   <li><a name="11"></a><font size="2">It was not that the Call of the Aethyr had 
     been ill performed, or that its virtue and efficacy were impaired. It was 
     that the Seer being attached to his human instrument, that instrument automatically 
     strove with all its might to escape the impact of so tremendous and so dire 
     an energy which would infallibly be transmitted (to a certain small extent) 
     through the Seer to it. In the same way, in a much lesser manner, there is 
     a limit to the degree of pain a man can inflict on himself, as experiments 
     with the Boulometer (the instrument invented by the Seer to measure this virtue) 
     have shewn. (Note - it was a self-adjustable thumb screw. - Note by Yorke)</font></li>
   <li><a name="12"></a><font size="2">This means more than the obvious. "The 
     colours of the spectrum compose pure White Light." The Seer could see 
     these colours directly, at the same time as the White. Another case of hypperabyssic 
     logic.</font></li>
   <li><a name="13"></a><font size="2">This doctrine is most profound and important. 
     It throws light upon the mystery of evil, and upon the nature of Maya in general.</font></li>
   <li><a name="14"></a><font size="2">Chaos is here the Yod of Tetragrammaton, 
     his daughter the final H. This passage is to be studied closely in connection 
     with the previous passages and notes with regard to the formula of {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod};indeed 
     one should preform samyama upon this whole matter. </font></li>
   <li><a name="15"></a><font size="2">Note well this thesis. Anything which is 
     not Pure Nothing is ipso facto unbalanced, and therefore imperfect --- indeed 
     illusory.</font></li>
   <li><a name="16"></a><font size="2">The path of Beth. Contrast this way of illusion 
     forcibly with the obsession of Microprosopus by Dath. (There are also the 
     difficulties of the Son with the glamour of the path of Gimel and of the Father 
     with the path of Aleph. See 3rd Aire concerning the Three Ways of Delusion 
     that guard the Crown.)</font></li>
   <li><a name="17"></a><font size="2">52 = {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Mem}{HEB:Yod}{HEB:Aleph}, 
     the fertile mother = 3 = Binah. 26 = {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod}; 
     also {HEB:Dalet} {HEB:Bet}{HEB:Koph} = Kabad, the husband of the impure Lilith, 
     and 1 plus 6 plus 9 plus 10, the Sephiroth of the Middle Pillar, the Phallus. 
     6 = 1 plus 2 plus 3, the Mystic number of Binah; also {Sun} who shines on 
     all alike: {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Bet}{HEB:Gemel} to collect, {HEB:Bet} {HEB:Dalet} 
     a bear (Venus in Furs), and {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Heh} a window, the illicit way 
     of ingress into a house. 12 = {HEB:Vau}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Heh} the title of Kether, 
     the Unity; 13 = {HEB:Dalet} {HEB:Chet} {HEB:Aleph} = Unity.</font></li>
   <li><a name="18"></a><font size="2">39 = {HEB:Dalet}{HEB:Chet}{HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh} 
     {HEB:Yod} "Tetragrammaton is One", although He is composed of 4 
     letters, hence the triumph over the power of 4, limitation. But this explanation 
     is not as clear, satisfactory and convincing with that singular feeling of 
     ecstatic illumination which one rightly demands of the Qabalistic demonstration. 
     There should be some further gematria of 39 not yet discovered. 2 is Beth, 
     Atu I, Mayan the Great Scorceror. 78 = Mezla ({HEB:Aleph} {HEB:Lamed} {HEB:Zain} 
     {HEB:Mem}) the Influence from Kether, and the number of the Tarot Cards. I.e., 
     she destroys him by his own energies. {WEH Note: In traditional Qabalah Mezla 
     is not the Influence from Kether, but the omnipresence of Limitless Light 
     of Ain.}</font></li>
   <li><a name="19"></a><font size="2">Because she includes her daughter (10) in 
     her own formula, she can use the daughter for Her own purposes. </font></li>
   <li><a name="20"></a><font size="2">This reversal of the evident exoteric meaning 
     of the Call is stupendous. This book, 418, is full of similar interpretations 
     "by the rule of contraries". But this rule must be applied with 
     skill and discretion, if error is to be avoided. It is a lamentable fact that 
     a worthy Zelator of A.{SUP:.}. A.{SUP:.}., one Frater Achad, having been taught 
     (patiently enough) by the Seer to use this formula, was lured by his vanity 
     to suppose that he had discovered it himself, and proceeded to apply it indiscriminately. 
     He tried to stand the Serpent of Wisdom on its head, and argued that as he 
     was a 1x = 10{square x} of the Order, he must equally be a 10x = 1{square 
     x}. As <em>The Book of Lies</em> says, "I wrenched DOG backwards to find 
     God; now God barks!" He would have been better advised to reverse his 
     adored ONE and taken a dose of ENO! (ENO, an English purgative. T.)</font></li>
   <li><a name="21"></a><font size="2">The infinity of Nuit.</font></li>
   <li><a name="22"></a><font size="2">The infinity of Hadit.</font></li>
   <li><a name="23"></a><font size="2">i.e. an "Event, the fundamental unit 
     of Manifested Existence. </font></li>
   <li><a name="24"></a><font size="2">In Kelly's original: "It repenteth 
     Me that I have made Man." Kelly was in constant trouble with his education 
     as an orthodox Christian; also Dee forced him to reject the True Messengers, 
     whose discourse implied antinomian Pantheism.</font></li>
   <li><a name="25"></a><font size="2">One general application of the Law of Thelema. 
     It is a stupid error to try to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear; it hurts 
     both parties to the transaction. The basic blunder is to set up an arbitrary 
     ideal standard of "what ought to be". The "evil beginnings" 
     on all planes have a proper and a useful function. A strong healthy man cannot 
     be made by putting him in irons and protecting him artificially from all the 
     "dangers of life."</font></li>
   <li><a name="26"></a><font size="2">The passage is criticism of an obscure doctrine 
     of the Qabalah. There is however a real mystery behind the rhetoric. {WEH 
     Note: The doctrine in Qabalah is that the Aleph remained in the mouth of the 
     Creator, and Beth was the first letter to manifest. This comes partly from 
     Aleph being the first letter and partly from Aleph being unpronouncable without 
     another letter. Aleph is a pure aspirant. Beth in Hebrew signifies "in" 
     as in "in the beginning". What does all This bear on Crowley's use 
     of "Hadit" from the Stele, in place of the more common "BaHadit", 
     Egyptian for entrance into the Winged Disk of the Sun?} </font></li>
   <li><a name="27"></a><font size="2">All these passages in brackets are the <em>currente 
     lingua</em> explanations of the Seer (to himself) as each new phrase of the 
     text was delivered by the Angel. To understand how startling it all was to 
     him, one must remember that he had been using this Call, in its own obvious 
     sense, for many weeks, and always with the utmost force and solemnity. His 
     only warning had been the intuitive feeling that the Call was really a rejoicing 
     at the opening of the 9th Aire. And he had thought this merely subjective, 
     due to the relief of having passed through the Abyss.</font></li>
   <li><a name="28"></a><font size="2">This was certainly due to no ordinary cause. 
     The Seer was lying on the roof of the Hotel Royal at Biskra in the shade of 
     the minaret. It was a cool bright morning.</font></li>
   <li><a name="29"></a><font size="2">Prometheus stole the fire of Jupiter. Ixion 
     attempted the virtue of Juno. The Seer, in trying to penetrate this most holy 
     Aire, was similarly presumptious.</font></li>
   <li><a name="30"></a><font size="2">He was using the Sign of the Rending of 
     the Veil, (See <em>Liber O, Eqx</em>. I, No. 2) against the obscurity of the 
     Aire.</font></li>
   <li><a name="31"></a><font size="2">i.e. the Magister Templi. See 6th Aethyr 
     et al. supra. Only a Magus can truly pierce the veil of BABALON. It is written 
     (of Isis), "No man (i.e., Nemo, the Magister Templi) hath lifted my veil." 
     But to lift it and look upon HER is one thing; to possess HER another! </font></li>
   <li><a name="32"></a><font size="2">The physical exhaustion of the Seer was 
     complete. He realized that further effort was impossible; and --- more also! 
     --- that had he suddenly succeeded, while in this state, the fury of the impact 
     of the Energy of the Aire would have been instantly destructive of his physical 
     form.</font></li>
   <li><a name="33"></a><font size="2">Hammam Salahin: Sulphurous waters, admirably 
     apt to the idea of BABALON, whom the Seer intuitively understood to be the 
     Soul of this Second Aire.</font></li>
   <li><a name="34"></a><font size="2">Black for Binah. The pyramid for the phallus, 
     for she is also androgyne. Or, as an unit of Her City, beneath the Night of 
     Pan. See 14th Aire.</font></li>
   <li><a name="35"></a><font size="2">The most perfect and mysterious of the symbols 
     of the Feminine Principle. Its mathematical correspondences are of the greatest 
     importance. See <em>The Canon</em> and several other treatises on Qabalistic 
     Geometry.</font></li>
   <li><a name="36"></a><font size="2">This is the last desperate attempt of the 
     Rauch of the Seer to escape the Terror of the Presence of Babalon.</font></li>
   <li><a name="37"></a><font size="2">i.e. the Magister Templi.</font></li>
   <li><a name="38"></a><font size="2">This apparently simple phrase conceals an 
     allusion of the most sublime and terrific import. See <em>AL</em> I, 14, 16, 
     19. Also <em>The Book of Lies</em>, caps. 4 and 15. Mohammed said, "Cursed 
     be he that maketh himself Earth, and Woman Heaven!" For he understood 
     this Formula as of enormous Magical Power and wished to keep it from the profane, 
     who might abuse it, or injure themselves by ignorant of imprudent application. 
     </font></li>
   <li><a name="39"></a><font size="2">See <em>The Book of Lies</em>, Cap. 3.</font></li>
   <li><a name="40"></a><font size="2">This seems to refer to Thmaist, whose Aeon 
     will succeed that of Horus. She is Atu VIII referring to Libra, the House 
     of Venus. In her also, then, is BABALON the Ageless Virgin-Harlot, our Mother 
     as our Concubine.</font></li>
   <li><a name="41"></a><font size="2">Cf. 3rd Aire, the vision of Lilith. This 
     triangle seems to symbolize Limitation or Restriction; or so the sequel implies.</font></li>

     water symbolize evil --- in all senses, from the grossest to the most exalted. 
     They represent the falling into Passivity; whereras the Activity of Energy 
     is the Idea of Joy. </font></li>
   <li><a name="52"></a><font size="2">This Black Rose is then the veil of BABALON 
     Herself. It is the repulsiveness which is one half of Fascination.</font></li>
   <li><a name="53"></a><font size="2">Thus suddenly - BABALON - breaks through 
     to her lover.</font></li>
   <li><a name="54"></a><font size="2">This is meant in its normal physical sense. 
     The Seer supposed at the time that he had actually lost his sight.</font></li>
   <li><a name="55"></a><font size="2">Against the appalling conviction that he 
     had been stricken blind for his presumption in daring to aspire to BABALON 
     in so intimate a sense he gathered himself together in a furious assault upon 
     Her.</font></li>
   <li><a name="56"></a><font size="2">From the Stele of Revealing.</font></li>
   <li><a name="57"></a><font size="2">The outburst of the orgasm (see Note 3, 
     page 38). It continued unabated throughout the whole of the vision. The Seer 
     was all this time seated in the water of the hot spring, struggling with all 
     the pressure on his body, and roaring aloud in the intensity of his agony 
     or ecstasy. This helped him to endure physically the continuous spasm of Joy.

   <li><a name="58"></a><font size="2">AHA = {HEB:Aleph}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Aleph} = 
     7. It is therefore a God-name of Venus. Interpreted by Yetziratic attribution, 
     it is "The Crossing of our Lady ({HEB:Heh} = the Supernal Mother) in 
     the air ({HEB:Aleph})." It is also the Pentagram between two Swastikas. 
     The symbolism of this word, simple as it is, is far too extensive to discuss 
     adequately in a note. It must be studied intimately and at length by the Postulant</font></li>
   <li><a name="59"></a><font size="2">Hadit is a mathematical expression rather 
     than a God. By his form is meant the Winged Globe, which is used in the Stele 
     of Revealing to represent Him. </font></li>
   <li><a name="60"></a><font size="2">This was in a pool almost inconveniently 
     hot to the normal sense.</font></li>
   <li><a name="61"></a><font size="2">Meaning, the four watchtowers of the universe 
     (<em>Eqx</em>. I, VII). For the attributions of the Senses to the Elements 
     see <em>777</em>. The growing intelligibility of the words indicates the exhaustion 
     of the rapture of the Seer. The gradual withdrawal of the immanence of BABALON.</font></li>
   <li><a name="62"></a><font size="2">Hitherto, the intellectual content of the 
     Aethyr has been marked by the Moral (or rather Spiritual) Ravishment of the 
     Seer by BABALON.</font></li>
   <li><a name="63"></a><font size="2">At this point the Seer sank back exhausted. 
     The Scribe, fearing that he might be drowned, assisted him to come out of 
     the Pool. </font></li>
   <li><a name="64"></a><font size="2">This began instantly on the resumption of 
     the Vision. We must assume that the Angel of the Aire, or one of His ministers, 
     undertook the task of preparing the Seer for the "voice of the Aethyr" 
     in this manner. --- It is the language of the Sappho-Calypso angel, commonly 
     called Bathyllic. Its translation is: "Now it glides in to the heaven-home, 
     glides. Seducingly the mentrila of the begotten one of the Holy Head (or Skull) 
     takes hold of the soft tissues, subtly plying its shuttle. Light follows the 
     explosion. The soft tissues, cleaving to the shuttle, pump out every drop 
     of water from the well."</font></li>
   <li><a name="65"></a><font size="2">The Magical Fascination of the whole Aethyr 
     is something quite apart from, and beyond, almost anything else in the experience 
     of the seer. The effort upon him, 31 Equinoxes later, of writing these notes, 
     is quite extraordinary. The memory of it diminishes the value of the rest 
     of his life, with few excepted incidents, almost to nothing. </font></li>
   <li><a name="66"></a><font size="2">The reversal of the formula of IAO (see 
     <em>Book 4</em>, part 3) implies roughly, the general Mystical, as opposed 
     to the general Magical, Process. </font></li>
   <li><a name="67"></a><font size="2">From this it would appear that BABALON (who 
     is speaking through one of Her ministers) is the Feminine (or Androgyne) equivalent 
     and not merely complement --- of Pan. This is shewn in many of Her images.</font></li>
   <li><a name="68"></a><font size="2">These visions are semi-distractions, due 
     to the Seer's human weakness, which could not endure the rapture of the Voice. 
     "Wisdom says: be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy." <em>AL</em>, 
     II, 70. During the great revelation of the Cairo Working, the Seer had been 
     similarly ravished, and fainted under the excess of Enthusiasm. </font></li>
   <li><a name="69"></a><font size="2"><em>AL</em> I, 44. "For pure will, 
     unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect." 
     This doctrine is fundamental to all working soever. Its neglect vitiates (by 
     a paradox curious enough) all fruitfulness in any operation. One may indeed 
     distinguish work worthy of being performed from menial toil (such as that 
     of statesmen, financiers, and sewer rats) by this criterion. (Faith, spelt 
     empirically {GRK:phi} {GRK:alpha} {GRK:iota} {GRK:theta} --- a practice not 
     to be commended or even defended -- it being of the nature of paranomasia 
     -- is equivalent to {HEB:Resh}{HEB:Shin} {HEB:Koph} --- lawful.)</font></li>
   <li><a name="70"></a><font size="2">BABALON, "in whom all power is given," 
     is the Teh, Sakhi, {HEB:Heh}. She is seductive and deadly, being the Disturber 
     of the Total Equilibrium of the Absolute Zero, which considered as a positive 
     Idea, is Existence in perfect Peace, an immutable Essence. But He cannot truly 
     exist without Her; and through Her therefore comes Change, which is Love and 
     Death.</font></li>
   <li><a name="71"></a><font size="2">See the 11th Call, which invokes {Spirit} 
     of {Water}, the Princess of the Lotus of the Floods. (The reading is a variant 
     of that given in the official A{.·.} A{.·.} ritual.) The Eagle is snow-white 
     for Her purity; and He is the White Eagle of the Alchemists. </font></li>
   <li><a name="72"></a><font size="2">See the Keys or Calls, especially the 5th 
     and 6th, where the angels (of the watchtowers) are specifically mentioned.</font></li>
   <li><a name="73"></a><font size="2">That is, since the working of Sir Edward 
     Kelly and Dr. John Dee.</font></li>
   <li><a name="74"></a><font size="2">Shin=300. Also Shin is Atu XX - the Last 
     Judgment (or Resurrection, as implied in the usual form of the Atu). Shin 
     is Spirit in the regular attribution (the triple tongue of Fire; see the Acts 
     of the Apostles). 300=Ruach Elohim (Resh, Vau, Cheth and Aleph, Lamed, Heh, 
     Yod, Mem), the spirit of the gods.</font></li>
   <li><a name="75"></a><font size="2">The Seer had absolutely forgotten this prophecy, 
     and was amazed at the final identification of the child in LIL with Hoor.</font></li>
   <li><a name="76"></a><font size="2">This implies that the Voice of the Aethyr 
     ends never! For N is the vinration which continues through the nostrils. See 
     Magick in Theory and Practice, pp. 45-47, on the word AUMGN; whereby the Seer 
     rebuked and perfected the AUM of the Rishis. N Equals Nun, the letter of sexual 
     immortality, the formula of perfection through putrefaction.</font></li>
