       <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 13th Aethyr,<br>
         Which is Called ZIM</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
       <p>Into the Stone there cometh an image of shining waters, glistening in 
         the sun. Unfathomable is their beauty, for they are limpid, and the floor 
         is of gold. Yet the sense thereof is of fruitlessness. </p>
       <p>And an Angel cometh forth, of pure pale gold, walking upon the water. 
         Above his head is a rainbow, and the water foams beneath his feet. And 
         he saith: Before his face am I come that hath the thirty-three thunders 
         of increase in his hand. From the golden water shalt thou gather corn<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>All the Aire behind him is gold, but it opens as it were a veil. There 
         are two terrible black giants, wrestling in mortal hatred. And there is 
         a little bird upon a bush, and the bird flaps its wings. Thereat the strength 
         of the giants snaps, and they fall in heaps to the earth, as though all 
         their bones were suddenly broken<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>And now waves of light roll through the Aethyr, as if they were playing. 
         Therefore suddenly I am in a garden<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>, upon a terrace 
         of a great castle, that is upon a rocky mountain. In the garden are fountains 
         and many flowers. There are girls also in the garden, tall, slim, delicate 
         and pale. And now I see that the flowers are the girls, for they change 
         from one to another; so varied, and lucent, and harmonious is all this 
         garden, that it seems like a great opal<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>A voice comes: This water which thou seest is called the water of death<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. 
         But NEMO hath filled therefrom our springs. </p>
       <p>And I said: Who is NEMO? </p>
       <p>And the voice answered: A dolphin's tooth, and a ram's horns, and the 
         hand of a man that is hanged, and the phallus of a goat<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
         (By this I understand that nun is explained by shin, and he' by resh, 
         and mem by yod, and ayin by tau<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. NEMO is therefore called 165 = 
         11 x 15; and is in himself 910 = 91 Amen x 10; and 13 x 70 = The One Eye, 
         <em>Achad Ayin</em>.) </p>
       <p>And now there cometh an Angel into the garden, but he hath not any of 
         the attributes of the former Angels, for he is like a young man, dressed 
         in white linen robes. </p>
       <p>And he saith: No man hath beheld the face of my Father. Therefore he 
         that hath beheld it is called NEMO. And know thou that every man that 
         is called NEMO hath a garden that he tendeth<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
         And every garden that is and flourisheth hath been prepared from the desert 
         by NEMO, watered with the waters that were called death. </p>
       <p>And I say unto him: To what end is the garden prepared? </p>
       <p>And he saith: First for the beauty and delight thereof; and next because 
         it is written, "And Tetragrammaton Elohim planted a garden eastward 
         in Eden." And lastly, because though every flower bringeth forth 
         a maiden, yet is there one flower that shall bring forth a man-child. 
         And his name shall be called NEMO, when he beholdeth the face of my Father. 
         And he that tendeth the garden seeketh not to single out the flower that 
         shall be NEMO. He doeth naught but tend the garden. </p>
       <p>And I said: Pleasant indeed is the garden<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>, and light is the toil of tending 
         it, and great is the reward. </p>
       <p>And he said: Bethink thee that NEMO hath beheld the face of my Father. 
         In Him is only Peace. </p>
       <p>And I said: Are all gardens like unto this garden? </p>
       <p>And he waved his hand, and in the Aire across the valley appeared an 
         island of coral, rosy, with green palms and fruit-trees, in the midst 
         of the bluest of the seas<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>And he waved his hand again, and there appeared a valley shut in by mighty 
         snow mountains, and in it were pleasant streams of water, rushing through, 
         and broad rivers, and lakes covered with lilies<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>And he waved his hand again, and there was a vision, as it were of an 
         oasis in the desert<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>And again he waved his hand, and there was a dim country with grey rocks, 
         and heather, and gorse, and bracken<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>And he waved his hand yet again, and there was a park, and a small house 
         therein, surrounded by yews<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. This time the 
         house opens, and I see in it an old man, sitting by a table. He is blind. 
         Yet he writeth in a great book, constantly. I see what he is writing: 
         "The words of the Book are as the leaves of the flowers in the garden. 
         Many indeed of these my songs shall go forth as maidens, but there is 
         one among them, which one I know not, that shall be a man-child, whose 
         name shall be NEMO, when he hath beheld the face of the Father, and become 
         blind." </p>
       <p>(All this vision is most extraordinarily pleasant and peaceful, entirely 
         without strength or ecstasy, or any positive quality, but equally free 
         from the opposites of any of those qualities.) And the young man seems 
         to read my thought, which is, that I should love to stay in this garden 
         and do nothing for ever; for he sayeth to me: Come with me, and behold 
         how NEMO tendeth his garden<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>So we enter the earth, and there is a veiled figure, in absolute darkness. 
         Yet it is perfectly possible to see in it, so that the minutest details 
         do not escape us. And upon the root of one flower he pours acid so that 
         that root writhes as if in torture. And another he cuts, and the shriek 
         is like the shriek of a mandrake, torn up by the roots. And another he 
         chars with fire, and yet another he anoints with oil. </p>
       <p>And I said: Heavy is the labour, but great indeed is the reward. </p>
       <p>And the young man answered me: He shall not see the reward, he tendeth 
         the garden<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>And I said: What shall come unto him? </p>
       <p>And he said: This thou canst not know, nor is it revealed by the letters 
         that are the totems of the stars, but only by the stars. </p>
       <p>And he says to me, quite disconnectedly: The man of earth is the adherent. 
         The lover giveth his life unto the work among men. The hermit goeth solitary, 
         and giveth only of his light unto men<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. 
       </p>
       <p>And I ask him: Why does he tell me that? </p>
       <p>And he says: I tell thee not. Thou tellest thyself, for thou hast pondered 
         thereupon for many days, and hast not found light. And now that thou art 
         called NEMO, the answer to every riddle that thou hast not found shall 
         spring up in thy mind, unsought. Who can tell upon what day a flower shall 
         bloom<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>? </p>
       <p>And thou shalt give thy wisdom unto the world, and that shall be thy 
         garden. And concerning time and death, thou hast naught to do with these 
         things. For though a precious stone be hidden in the sand of the desert, 
         it shall not heed for the wind of the desert, although it be but sand. 
         For the worker of works hath worked thereupon; and because it is clear, 
         it is invisible; and because it is hard, it moveth not. </p>
       <p>All these words are heard by everyone that is called NEMO. And with that 
         doth he apply himself to understanding. And he must understand the virtue 
         of the waters of death, and he must understand the virtue of the sun and 
         the wind, and of the worm that turneth the earth, and the stars that roof 
         in the garden. And he must understand the separate nature and property 
         of every flower, or how shall he tend his garden? </p>
       <p>And I said to him: Concerning the Vision and the Voice, I would know 
         if these things be of essence of the Aethyr, or of the essence of the 
         seer<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. </p>
       <p>And he answers: It is of the essence of him that is called NEMO, combined 
         with essence of the Aethyr, for from the 1st Aethyr to the 15th Aethyr, 
         there is no vision and no voice, save for him that is called NEMO. And 
         he that seeketh the vision and the voice therein is led away by dog- faced 
         demons that show no sign of truth, seducing from the Sacred Mysteries, 
         unless his name be NEMO. </p>
       <p>And hadst thou not been fitted, thou too hadst been led away, for before 
         the gate of the 15th Aethyr, is this written: He shall send them strong 
         delusion, that they should believe a lie. And again it is written: The 
         Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart. And again it is written that God tempteth 
         man. But thou hadst the word and the sign, and thou hadst authority from 
         thy superior<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>, and licence<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. And thou hast 
         done well in that thou didst not dare, and in that thou dost dare<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. 
         For daring is not presumption. </p>
       <p>And he said moreover: Thou dost well to keep silence, for I perceive 
         how many questions arise in thy mind; yet already thou knowest that the 
         answering, as the asking, must be vain. For NEMO hath all in himself. 
         He hath come where there is no light or knowledge, only when he needeth 
         them no more. </p>
       <p>And then we bow silently, giving a certain sign, called the Sign of Isis 
         Rejoicing<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. And then he remaineth to ward 
         the Aethyr, while I return unto the bank of sand that is the bed of the 
         river near the desert. </p>
       <p>The River-bed near Bou-Sada.<br>
