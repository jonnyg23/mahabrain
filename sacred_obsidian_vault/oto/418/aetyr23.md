 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 23rd Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called TOR</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font size="6"><strong>.</strong> </font></p>
 <p>In the brightness of the stone are three lights, brighter than all, which revolve 
   ceaselessly<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. And now there is a spider's web 
   of silver<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> covering 
   the whole of the stone. Behind the spider's web is a star of twelve rays<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>; 
   and behind that again, a black bull, furiously pawing up the ground. The flames 
   from his mouth increase and whirl, and he cries: Behold the mystery of toil, 
   O thou who art taken in the toils of mystery<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
   For I who trample the earth thereby make whirlpools in the air; be comforted, 
   therefore, for though I be black, in the roof of my mouth is the sign of the 
   Beetle<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. Bent are the backs 
   of my brethren, yet shall they gore the lion with their horns. Have I not the 
   wings of the eagle, and the face of the man? </p>
 <p>And now he is turned into one of those winged Assyrian bull-men. </p>
 <p>And he sayeth: The spade of the husbandman is the sceptre of the king<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. 
   All the heavens beneath me, they serve me. They are my fields and my gardens 
   and my orchards and my pastures. </p>
 <p>Glory be unto thee, who didst set thy feet in the North<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>; 
   whose forehead is pierced with the sharp points of the diamonds in thy crown 
   <a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>; whose heart is pierced 
   with the spear of thine own fecundity <a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Thou art an egg of blackness, and a worm of poison. But thou hast formulated 
   thy father, and made fertile thy mother. </p>
 <p>Thou art the basilisk whose gaze turns men to stone, and the cockatrice at 
   the breast of an harlot that giveth death for milk. Thou art the asp that has 
   stolen into the cradle of the babe. Glory unto thee, who art twined about the 
   world as the vine that clingeth to the bare body of a bacchanal<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Also, though I be planted so firmly upon the earth, yet is my blood wine and 
   my breath fire of madness. With these wings, though they be but little, I lift 
   myself above the crown of the yod<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>, 
   and being without fins I yet swim in the inviolate fountain<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>I disport myself in the ruins of Eden, even as Leviathan in the false sea<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>, 
   being whole as the rose at the crown of the cross<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. Come ye unto 
   me, my children, and be glad. At the end of labour is the power of labour<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. 
   And in my stability is concentrated eternal change<a href="#17"><font size="2"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>For the whirlings of the universe are but the course of the blood in my heart. 
   And the unspeakable variety thereof is but my divers hairs, and plumes, and 
   gems in my tall crown. The change which ye lament is the life of my rejoicing, 
   and the sorrow that blackeneth your hearts is the myriad deaths by which I am 
   renewed. </p>
 <p>And the instability which maketh ye to fear, is the little waverings of balance 
   by which I am assured<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. And now the 
   veil of silver tissue-stuff closes over him, and above that, a purple veil, 
   and above that, a golden veil, so that now the whole stone is like a thick mat 
   of woven gold wires; and there come forth, one from each side of the stone, 
   two women, and grasp each other by both hands, and kiss, and melt into one another; 
   and melt away<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. And 
   now the veils open again, the gold parts, and the purple parts, and the silver 
   parts, and there is a crowned eagle, also like the Assyrian eagles. And he cries: 
   All my strength and stability are turned to the use of flight<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. 
   For though my wings are of fine gold, yet my heart is the heart of a scorpion<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. 
   Glory unto thee, who being born in a stable didst make thee mirth of the filth 
   thereof, who didst suck in iniquity from the breast of thy mother the harlot; 
   who didst flood with iniquity the bodies of thy concubines. Thou didst lie in 
   the filth of the streets with the dogs; thou wast tumbled and shameless and 
   wanton in a place where four roads meet. There wast thou defiled, and there 
   wast thou slain, and there wast thou left to rot. The charred stake was thrust 
   through thy bowels, and thy parts were cut off and thrust into thy mouth for 
   derision<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. All my unity 
   is dissolved; I live in the tips of my feathers<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. 
   That which I think to be myself is but infinite number<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. Glory unto the 
   Rose and the Cross, for the Cross is extended unto the uttermost end beyond 
   space and time and being and knowledge and delight! Glory unto the Rose that 
   is the minute point of its center! Even as we say; glory unto the Rose that 
   is Nuit the circumference of all, and glory unto the Cross that is the heart 
   of the Rose<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>! </p>
 <p>Therefore do I cry aloud, and my scream is the treble as the bellowing of the 
   bull is the bass<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. Peace in the highest and peace 
   in the lowest and peace in the midst thereof! Peace in the eight quarters, peace 
   in the ten points of the Pentagram! Peace in the twelve rays of the seal of 
   Solomon, and peace in the four and thirty whirlings of the hammer of Thor<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>! Behold! I blaze upon thee. (The 
   eagle is gone; it is only a flaming Rosy Cross of white brilliance.) I catch 
   thee up into rapture. FALUTLI, FALUTLI<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>! 
   ... O it dies, it dies.</p>
 <p>Bou Sada. November 28, 1909. 9:30-10:15 A.M.</p>

   <li><a name="2"></a><font size="2">The Three Gunas, Sattvas, Rajas, Tamas. This 
     is an Introit to the Aethyr. As we proceed, we find more and more obstacles 
     to entering.</font></li>
   <li><a name="3"></a><font size="2">More introit; veils to the true Vision.</font></li>
   <li><a name="4"></a><font size="2">Tamas, Kerub of Earth. He and the Eagle of 
     Air make up the 4 Officers of the New Temple.</font></li>
   <li><a name="5"></a><font size="2">A warning to the Seer not to allow himself 
     to ignore or despise the plain facts of life. Mysteries --- nay, even The 
     Mysteries themselves! are apt to seduce the Aspirant. He becomes exalt (as 
     the cold rational French, observing these errors, call him) instead of exalted.</font></li>
   <li><a name="6"></a><font size="2">The tradition of the Bull Apis. The Beetle 
     is the Midnight Sun, the hidden hope of Earth.</font></li>
   <li><a name="7"></a><font size="2">The King rules by virtue of the labour of 
     his people. Even {Taurus} Earth is necessary as the support of Heaven. Nuit 
     is upheld by Shu, who stands on Seb. Neglect to understand this causes many 
     "pure Mystics" to fall lamentably. They "go off their base" 
     in the significant slang of common-sense folk.</font></li>
   <li><a name="8"></a><font size="2">The Bull is stationed in the North.</font></li>
   <li><a name="9"></a><font size="2">The Bull is sacred to Osiris. This refers 
     to the Crown of Thorns.</font></li>
   <li><a name="10"></a><font size="2">Again a reference to the Formula of Osiris. 
     The Spear (Sacred Lance, Phallus) pierces the heart of the Dying God.</font></li>
   <li><a name="11"></a><font size="2">These two paragraphs declare the identity 
     of the Bull with his Zodiacal opposite, Scorpio.</font></li>
   <li><a name="12"></a><font size="2">The Crown of Yod (as a path on the Tree) 
     is Chesed. It leads thither from Tiphereth. The path of the Bull leads from 
     Chokmah down to Chesed.</font></li>
   <li><a name="13"></a><font size="2">Refers to the Symbol of the woman and the 
     Bull. See 16th Aire.</font></li>
   <li><a name="14"></a><font size="2">See Knorr von Rosenroth on the Qlipoth (the 
     Shells). He wrote <em>Kaballa Denudata</em> in Latin which was translated 
     into English as <em>The Kaballah Unveiled</em> by McGregor Mathers, one of 
     the Chiefs of The Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn</font></li>

   <li><a name="18"></a><font size="2">All this paragraph explains this doctrine 
     of Stability = Change. (Yesod, Support of the Tree, is also {Air} &amp; {Moon}). 
     </font></li>
   <li><a name="19"></a><font size="2">These are intended to show symbolically 
     that the Bull is the same as the Eagle. </font></li>
   <li><a name="20"></a><font size="2">This transformation into Air shows the identity 
     (in ultimate philosophy) of the two forces of change which constitute the 
     Lesser Mysteries of the Sword and the Disk. </font></li>
   <li><a name="21"></a><font size="2">Refers to the Scorpion in the Symbol of 
     the Bull of Mithras. </font></li>
   <li><a name="22"></a><font size="2">These two paragraphs refer to the Formula 
     of the Dying God, its perversion and profanation at the hands of those who 
     abused it. </font></li>
   <li><a name="23"></a><font size="2">Air has a peripheral consciousness. </font></li>
   <li><a name="24"></a><font size="2">The True Unity does not exist in any particular 
     number, but in {HEB:Aleph}x as a whole. </font></li>
   <li><a name="25"></a><font size="2">The Rose and Cross are not merely symbols 
     of definite types of energy, female and male. They are extended in the correlative 
     symbols of Infinity: Nuit and Hadit. </font></li>
   <li><a name="26"></a><font size="2">Air and Earth are harmonious vibrations, 
     complementary.</font></li>
   <li><a name="27"></a><font size="2">The vibrations of Tetragrammaton, Jeheshua, 
     the Hexagram, and the Swastika are Swastika re duplicated, being complete 
     in each of the two Series, Air and Earth, the lower forms of Masculine and 
     Feminine.</font></li>
   <li><a name="28"></a><font size="2">See <em>Liber VII</em>, Cap. V, v. 30. It 
     is the cry of the consummated rapture of the Dissolution of any symbol by 
     virtue of Love. FAL is Aleph (AFL, thick darkness; PLA, the Hidden Wonder, 
     a title of Kether.) The whole symbolism of Aleph, 111, must be studied thoroughly. 
     It is especially the equations: One = Zero; and Three = One. Aleph is Iacchus, 
     Lord of Ecstasy; Harpocrates, Lord of Silence: Zeus Arrhenotheleus; Bacchus 
     Diphues, Baphomet, etc. Lord of the Two-in-One Love; Parsifal, The Pure Fool, 
     the Wandering Spirit of God, who impregnates the King's Daughter. UT is the 
     title of the Holy Guardian Angel in the Upanishads. C.q.v. also the poem of 
     "UT" in "The Winged Beetle". LI is the Hebrew for "to 
     me". See AL I, v. 51, 53, 61, 62, 63. (L is Atu VIII = {HEB:Lamed} = 
     the Satisfied Woman; I is {HEB:Yod}, Atu IX, the Hermit). See AL II, v. 24 
     --- The Hidden Virtue which satisfies Her. {GRK:Phi}{GRK:Alpha}{GRK:Lambda} 
     {GRK:Upsilon} {GRK:Tau}{GRK:Lambda}{GRK: I ota} = 1271 = 2542/2. 2542 = {GRK:Theta} 
     {GRK:epsilon} {GRK:lambda} {GRK:eta} {GRK:mu} {GRK:alpha} spelt in full.</font></li>
