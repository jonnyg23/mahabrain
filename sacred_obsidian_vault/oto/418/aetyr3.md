 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 3rd Aethyr</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a><font size="6"><strong>,<br>
   Which is Called ZON</strong></font><a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>There is an angry light in the stone; now it is become clear. </p>
 <p>In the centre is that minute point of light which is the true Sun, and in the 
   circumference is the Emerald Snake. And joining them are the rays which are 
   the plumes of Maat, and because the distance is infinite, therefore are they 
   parallel from the circumference, although they diverge from the centre. </p>
 <p>In all this is no voice and no motion. </p>
 <p>And yet it seems that the great Snake feedeth upon the plumes of Truth as upon 
   itself, so that it contracteth<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. But ever so little 
   as it contracteth, without it gloweth the golden rim, which is that minute point 
   in the centre. </p>
 <p>And all this is the sigil of the Aethyr, gold and azure and green. Yet also 
   these are the Severities. </p>
 <p>It is only in the first three Aethyrs that we find the pure essence, for all 
   the other Aethyrs are but as Malkuth to complete these three triads, as hath 
   before been said. And this being the second reflection, therefore is it the 
   palace of two hundred and eighty judgments<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>For all these paths<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a> 
   are in the course of the Flaming Sword from the side of Severity. And the other 
   two paths are Zayin, which is a sword; and Shin, which is a tooth. These are 
   then the five severities which are 280. </p>
 <p>All this is communicated to the Seer interiorly. </p>
 <p>"And the eye of His benignancy is closed. Let it not be opened upon the 
   Aethyr, lest the severities be mitigated, and the house fall.<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>" 
   Shall not the house fall, and the Dragon sink? Verily all things have been swallowed 
   up in destruction; and Chaos hath opened his jaws and crushed the Universe as 
   a Bacchanal crusheth a grape between her teeth. Shall not destruction swallow 
   up destruction, and annihilation confound annihilation? Twenty and two are the 
   mansions<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a> of the House of 
   my Father, but there cometh an ox<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a> that shall set 
   his forehead against the House, and it shall fall. For all these things are 
   the toys of the Magician<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a> 
   and the Maker of Illusions, that barreth the Understanding from the Crown. </p>
 <p>O thou that hast beheld the City of the Pyramids, how shouldst thou behold 
   the House of the Juggler<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>? For he is wisdom, 
   and by wisdom hath he made the Worlds, and from that wisdom issue judgements 
   70 by 4, that are the 4 eyes of the double-headed one; that are the 4 devils, 
   Satan, Lucifer, Leviathan, Belial, that are the great princes of the evil of 
   the world<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And Satan is worshipped by men under the name of Jesus; and Lucifer is worshipped 
   by men under the name of Brahma; and Leviathan is worshipped by men under the 
   name of Allah; and Belial is worshipped by men under the name of Buddha. </p>
 <p>(This is the meaning of the passage in <em>Liber Legis</em>, Chap. III.)<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>Moreover, there is Mary, a blasphemy against BABALON, for she hath shut herself 
   up<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>; and therefore 
   is she the Queen of all those wicked devils that walk upon the earth, those 
   that thou sawest even as little black specks that stained the Heaven of Urania. 
   And all these are the excrement of Choronzon. </p>
 <p>And for this is BABALON under the power of the Magician, that she hath submitted 
   herself unto the work; and she guardeth the Abyss<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
   And in her is a perfect purity of that which is above; yet she is sent as the 
   Redeemer to them that are below. For there is no other way into the Supernal 
   Mystery but through her, and the Beast on which she rideth; and the Magician 
   is set beyond her to deceive the brothers of blackness, lest they should make 
   unto themselves a crown<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>; for if there 
   were two crowns, then should Ygdrasil, that ancient tree, be cast out into the 
   Abyss, uprooted and cast down into the Outermost Abyss, and the Arcanum which 
   is in the Adytum should be profaned; and the Ark should be touched, and the 
   Lodge spied upon by them that are not masters, and the bread of the Sacrament 
   should be the dung of Choronzon; and the wine of the Sacrament should be the 
   water of Choronzon; and the incense should be dispersion; and the fire upon 
   the Altar should be hate. But lift up thyself; stand, play the man, for behold! 
   there shall be revealed unto thee the Great Terror, the thing of awe that hath 
   no name. </p>
 <p>And this is the mystery that I declare unto thee: that from the Crown itself 
   spring the three great delusions; Aleph is madness, and Beth is falsehood, and 
   Gimel is glamour<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. 
   And these three be greater than all, for they are beyond the words that I speak 
   unto thee; how much more therefore are they beyond the words that thou transmittest 
   unto men. </p>
 <p>Behold! the Veil of the Aethyr sundereth, and is torn, like a sail by the breath 
   of the tempest, and thou shalt see him as from afar off. This is that which 
   is written, "Confound her understanding with darkness," for thou canst 
   not speak this thing<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>It is the figure of the Magus of the Taro<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>; and in his right arm the torch 
   of the flames blazing upwards; in his left the cup of poison, a cataract into 
   Hell. And upon his head the evil talisman, blasphemy and blasphemy and blasphemy, 
   in the form of a circle. That is the greatest blasphemy of all<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. 
   On his feet hath he the scythes and swords and sickles; daggers; knives; every 
   sharp thing<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>, --- a millionfold, and all in 
   one. And before him is the Table that is a Table of wickedness, and 42-fold 
   Table. This Table is connected with the 42 Assessors of the Dead, for they are 
   the Accursers, whom the soul must baffle; and with the 42-fold name of God, 
   for this is the Mystery of Iniquity, that there was ever a beginning at all<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. And this Magus 
   casteth forth, by the might of his four weapons, veil after veil; a thousand 
   shining colours, ripping and tearing the Aethyr, so that it is like jagged saws, 
   or like broken teeth in the face of a young girl, or like disruption, or madness. 
   There is a horrible grinding sound, maddening. This is the mill in which the 
   Universal Substance, which is ether, was ground down into matter. </p>
 <p>The Seer prayeth that a cloud may come between him and the sun, so that he 
   may shut out the terror of the vision. And he is afire; he is terribly athirst; 
   and no help can come to him, for the shew-stone blazeth ever with the fury and 
   the torment and the blackness, and the stench of human flesh. The bowels of 
   little children are torn out and thrust into his mouth, and a poison is dropped 
   into his eyes. And Lilith<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>, a black monkey crawling with 
   filth, running with open sores, an eye torn out, eaten of worms, her teeth rotten, 
   her nose eaten away, her mouth a putrid mass of green slime, her dugs dropping 
   and cancerous, clings to him, kisses him. </p>
 <p>(Kill me! kill me!)<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a> 
 </p>
 <p>There is a mocking voice: Thou art become immortal. Thou wouldst look upon 
   the face of the Magician and thou hast not beheld him because of his Magick 
   veils. </p>
 <p>(Don't torture me!) </p>
 <p>Thus are all they fallen into the power of Lilith, who have dared to look upon 
   his face. </p>
 <p>The shew-stone is all black and corrupt. O filth! filth! filth! </p>
 <p>And this is her great blasphemy: that she hath taken the name of the First 
   Aethyr<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>, and bound 
   it on her brow, and added thereunto the shameless yod and the tau for the sign 
   of the Cross. </p>
 <p>She it is that squatteth upon the Crucifix, for the nastiness of her pleasure. 
   So that they that worship Christ suck up her filth upon their tongues, and therefore 
   their breaths stink<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>I was saved from that Horror by a black shining Triangle, with apex upwards<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>, 
   that came upon the face of the sun. </p>
 <p>And now the shew-stone is all clear and beautiful again. </p>
 <p>The pure pale gold of a fair maiden's hair, and the green of her girdle, and 
   the deep soft blue of her eyes. </p>
 <p><em>Note</em>. --- In this the gold is Kether, the blue is Chokmah, the green 
   is Binah. </p>
 <p>Thus she appeareth in the Aethyr, adorned with flowers and gems. It seems that 
   she hath incarnated herself upon earth, and that she will appear manifest in 
   a certain office in the Temple. </p>
 <p>I have seen some picture like her face; I cannot think what picture. It is 
   a piquant face, with smiling eyes and lips; the ears are small and pink, the 
   complexion is fair, but not transparent; not as fair as one would expect from 
   the hair and eyes. It is rather an impudent face, rather small, very pretty; 
   the nose very slightly less than straight, well- proportioned, rather large 
   nostrils. Full of vitality, the whole thing. Now very tall, rather slim and 
   graceful; a good dancer. </p>
 <p>There is another girl behind her, with sparkling eyes, mischievous, a smile 
   showing beautiful white teeth; an ideal Spanish girl, but fair. Very vivacious. 
   Only her head is visible, and now it is veiled by a black sun, casting forth 
   dull rays of black and gold. </p>
 <p>Then the disk of the sun is a pair of balances, held steady; and twined about 
   the central pole of the balance is the little green poisonous snake, with a 
   long forked tongue rapidly darting<a href="#27"><strong>27</strong></a>. </p>
 <p>And the Angel that hath spoken with me before, saith to me: The eye of His 
   benignancy is opened; therefore veileth he thine eyes from the vision. Manfully 
   hast thou endured; yet, hast thou been man, thou hadst not endured; and hadst 
   thou been wholly that which thou art, thou shouldst have been caught up in the 
   full vision that is unspeakable for Horror. And thou shouldst have beheld the 
   face of the Magician that thou hast not been able to behold, - of him from whom 
   issue forth the severities that are upon Malkuth, and his name is Misericordia 
   Dei. </p>
 <p>And because he is the dyad, thou mayest yet understand in two ways. Of first 
   way, the Mercy of God is that Mercy which Jehovah showed to the Amalekites<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>; and the second way is utterly 
   beyond thine understanding, for it is the upright, and thou knowest nothing 
   but the averse, - until Wisdom shall inform thine Understanding, and upon the 
   base of the Ultimate triangle arise the smooth point<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Veil therefore thine eyes, for that thou canst not master the Aethyr, unless 
   thy Mystery match Its Mystery. Seal up thy mouth also, for thou canst not master 
   the voice of the Aethyr, save only by Silence. </p>
 <p>And thou shalt give the sign of the Mother, for BABALON is thy fortress against 
   the iniquity of the Abyss, for the iniquity of that which bindeth her unto the 
   Crown<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>, and barreth 
   her from the Crown; for not until thou art made one with CHAOS<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a> 
   canst thou begin that last, that most terrible projection, the three-fold Regimen 
   which alone constitutes the Great Work. </p>
 <p>For Choronzon is as it were the shell or excrement of these three paths, and 
   therefore is his head raised unto Dath, and therefore have the Black Brotherhood 
   declared him to be the child of Wisdom and Understanding, who is but the bastard 
   of the Svastika. And this is that which is written in the Holy Qabalah, concerning 
   the Whirlpool and Leviathan, and the Great Stone<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Thus long have I talked with thee in bidding thee depart, that the memory of 
   the Aethyr might be dulled; for hadst thou come back suddenly into thy mortal 
   frame, thou hadst fallen into madness or death. For the vision is not such that 
   any may endure it. </p>
 <p>But now thy sense is dull, and the shew-stone but a stone. Therefore awake, 
   and give secretly and apart the sign of the Mother, and call four times upon 
   the name of CHAOS<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>, 
   that is the four-fold word that is equal to her seven-fold word. And then shalt 
   thou purify thyself, and return into the World. </p>
 <p>So I did that which was commanded me, and returned. </p>
 <p>Biskra.<br>

     not, and cannot be, the crown of Consciousness, if only because the Logic 
     beyond the Abyss convicts it of essential self contradiction. Dath, as seen 
     by the Magister Templi, is so far from being the opposite of Ignorance that 
     it is actually a demonstration that the Intellect is incapable of Truth. </font></li>
   <li><a name="16"></a><font size="2">Aleph is incapacity to apprehend --- the 
     absence of any steady truth. ({HEB:Aleph} = {Air}, the volatile). Beth is 
     the assertion of false relations, even in the illusion of the dyad. ({HEB:Bet} 
     = {Mercury}) And Gimel is the clouding of aspiration by the marsh miasma of 
     desire ({HEB:Gemel} = {Moon}). Such are the evil and averse counterparts of 
     the three highest faculties of the Soul: Aleph, the inspiration of the soul 
     in ecstasy; Beth, the virtue of Truthfulness without care of other issues;

     Chokma, the creative Mercury who transmits the Essence of Kether as a Logos, 
     that Kether may become intelligible to Himself through Binah. This lower Mercury

     {Cancer}) (An XII) I have just realized (after some days woodcarving) that 
     the use of a knife is to fashion shapeless things into Beauty. This is then

     Lilith is etymologically "The Woman of Night"; but is diversely 
     described by different authorities. To one she is, "from the head to 
     the navel, a woman --- from the navel to the feet of her, a man". To 
     another, "lovely shape that concealeth a black monkey, even as a figure 
     that draweth with her hands small images of men down into hell" (<em>Liber 
     Ararita</em> II, 10). She is also the "first wife of Adam" i.e. 
     the succubus who visits in their sleep those boys and men who have not previously 
     purified themselves by Right Coitus. The whole world of demons was in fact 
     created (according to Rabbinical tradition) by the nocturnal pollutions of 
     Adam. This is a true parable. For every sexual act produces its natural effect 
     on all planes. All forms of spiritual experience may be obtained in this manner, 
     according to the Magical Knowledge and Skill of the Operator. And there is 
     always a Child begotten on some plane or other, as the conditions of the experiment 
     decide. (Note. --- A.C. added the following here in his copy of <em>Eqx</em>. 
     I, No. 5. "Doris Gomez who came just before Jeanne Foster. It's a perfect 
     description of her normal nature. Add Laura Brown for the sake of completeness. 
     What about Alostrael?") </font></li>
   <li><a name="23"></a><font size="2">The Seer was physically overwhelmed by the 
     horror of this experience. It may seem surprising that such phenomena should 
     occur above the Abyss. But this Lilith is a positive form created by the Magus; 
     whereas, Choronzon is the breaking-up of all coherence. Here also is a mystery 
     of mysteries. Lilith is truly Babalon, as imagined by this energy of Mayan.</font></li>

   <li><a name="25"></a><font size="2">For the Christian, obsessed by Mayan, sees

   <li><a name="26"></a><font size="2">This is the Sigil of Binah in one of Her 
     forms. It instantly destroys the illusion of Lilith, who now appears in her 
     true shape as an avatar; a corporeal imagine of BABALON, recalling the maiden 
     of the 9th Aethyr. (Note. --- in A.C.'s <em>Eqx</em>. here to the para. beginning 
     "I have seen some picture" he notes in the margin "Hilarion, 
     Jeanne Robert Foster". --- To the para. beginning "then the disk 
     of the sun", he notes "Alice Ethel Coomaraswamy. She has Libra rising 
     and Sol in Scorpio and she is mad about green." --- To the para. beginning 
     "There is another girl", he notes "Helen Westley? - or Myriam 
     Deroxe.") </font></li>
