 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 8th Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called ZID</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>There appears in the stone a tiny spark of light. It grows a little, and seems 
   almost to go out, and grows again, and it is blown about the Aethyr, and by 
   the wind that blows it is it fanned, and now it gathers strength, and darts 
   like a snake or a sword, and now it steadies itself, and is like a Pyramid of 
   light that filleth the whole Aethyr. </p>
 <p>And in the Pyramid is one like unto an Angel, yet at the same time he <em>is</em> 
   the Pyramid, and he hath no form because he is of the substance of light, and 
   he taketh not form upon him, for though by him is form visible, he maketh it 
   visible only to destroy it.</p>
 <p>And he saith: The light is come to the darkness, and the darkness is made light. 
   Then is light married with light, and the child of their love is that other 
   darkness, wherein they abide that have lost name and form. Therefore did I kindle 
   him that had not understanding, and in <em>The Book of the Law</em> did I write 
   the secrets of truth that are like unto a star and a snake and a sword<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And unto him that understandeth at last do I deliver the secrets of truth in 
   such wise that the least of the little children of the light may run to the 
   knees of the mother and be brought to understand. </p>
 <p>And thus shall he do who will attain unto the mystery of the knowledge and 
   conversation of his Holy Guardian Angel: </p>
 <p>First, let him prepare a chamber, of which the walls and the roof shall be 
   white, and the floor shall be covered with a carpet of black squares and white, 
   and the border thereof shall be blue and gold. </p>
 <p>And if it be in a town, the room shall have no window, and if it be in the 
   country, then it is better if the window be in the roof. Or, if it be possible, 
   let this invocation be performed in a temple prepared for the ritual of passing 
   through the Tuat. </p>
 <p>From the roof he shall hang a lamp, wherein is a red glass, to burn olive oil. 
   And this lamp shall he cleanse and make ready after the prayer of sunset, and 
   beneath the lamp shall be an altar, foursquare, &amp; the height shall be thrice 
   half of the breadth or double the breadth. </p>
 <p>And upon the altar shall be a censor, hemispherical, supported upon three legs, 
   of silver, and within it an hemisphere of copper, and upon the top a grating 
   of gilded silver, and thereupon shall he burn incense made of four parts of 
   olibanum and two parts of stacte, and one part of lignum aloes, or of cedar, 
   or of sandal. And this is enough. </p>
 <p>And he shall also keep ready in a flask of crystal within the altar, holy anointing 
   oil made of myrrh and cinnamon and galangal. </p>
 <p>And even if he be of higher rank than a Probationer, he shall yet wear the 
   robe of the Probationer, for the star of flame showeth forth Ra Hoor Khuit openly 
   upon the breast, and secretly the blue triangle that descendeth is Nuit, and 
   the red triangle that ascendeth is Hadit. And I am the golden Tau in the midst 
   of their marriage. Also, if he choose, he may instead wear a close-fitting robe 
   of shot silk, purple and green, and upon it a cloak without sleeves, of bright 
   blue, covered with golden sequins, and scarlet within. </p>
 <p>And he shall make himself a wand of almond wood or of hazel cut by his own 
   hands at dawn at the Equinox, or at the Solstice, or on the day of Corpus Christi, 
   or on one of the feast-days that are appointed in <em>The Book of the Law</em>. 
 </p>
 <p>And he shall engrave with his own hand upon the plate of gold the Holy Sevenfold 
   Table, or the Holy Twelvefold Table, or some particular device. And it shall 
   be foursquare within a circle, and the circle shall be winged, and he shall 
   attach it about his forehead by a ribbon of blue silk. </p>
 <p>Moreover, he shall wear a fillet of laurel or rose or ivy or rue, and every 
   day, after the prayer of sunrise, he shall burn it in the fire of the censor. 
 </p>
 <p>Now he shall pray thrice daily, about sunset, and at midnight, and at sunrise. 
   And if he be able, he shall pray also four times between sunrise and sunset. 
 </p>
 <p>The prayer shall last for the space of an hour, at the least, and he shall 
   seek ever to extend it, and to inflame himself in praying. Thus shall he invoke 
   his Holy Guardian Angel for eleven weeks, and in any case he shall pray seven 
   times daily during the last week of the eleven weeks.</p>
 <p>And during all this time he shall have composed an invocation suitable, with 
   such wisdom and understanding as may be given him from the Crown, and this shall 
   he write in letters of gold upon the top of the altar. </p>
 <p>For the top of the altar shall be of white wood, well polished, and in the 
   centre thereof he shall have placed a triangle of oak-wood, painted with scarlet, 
   and upon this triangle the three legs of the censor shall stand. </p>
 <p>Moreover, he shall copy his invocation upon a sheet of pure white vellum, with 
   Indian ink, and he shall illuminate it according to his fancy and imagination, 
   that shall be informed by beauty. </p>
 <p>And on the first day of the twelfth week he shall enter the chamber at sunrise, 
   and he shall make his prayer, having first burnt the conjuration that he had 
   made upon the vellum in the fire of the lamp. </p>
 <p>Then, at his prayer, shall the chamber be filled with light insufferable for 
   splendour, and a perfume intolerable for sweetness. And his Holy Guardian Angel 
   shall appear unto him, yea, his Holy Guardian Angel shall appear unto him, so 
   that he shall be wrapt away into the Mystery of Holiness. </p>
 <p>All that day shall he remain in the enjoyment of the knowledge and conversation 
   of the Holy Guardian Angel. </p>
 <p>And for three days after he shall remain from sunrise unto sunset in the temple, 
   and he shall obey the counsel that his Angel shall have given unto him, and 
   he shall suffer those things that are appointed. </p>
 <p>And for ten days thereafter shall he withdraw himself as shall have been taught 
   unto him from the fullness of that communion, for he must harmonize the world 
   that is within with the world that is without. </p>
 <p>And at the end of the ninety-one days he shall return into the world, and there 
   shall he perform that work to which the Angel shall have appointed him. </p>
 <p>And more than this it is not necessary to say<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>, for his Angel 
   shall have entreated him kindly, and showed him in what manner he may be most 
   perfectly involved. And unto him that hath this Master there is nothing else 
   that he needeth, so long as he continue in the knowledge and conversation of 
   the Angel, so that he shall come at last into the City of the Pyramids. </p>
 <p>Lo! two and twenty are the paths of the Tree, but one is the Serpent of Wisdom; 
   ten are the ineffable emanations, but one is the Flaming Sword. </p>
 <p>Behold! There is an end to life and death, an end to the thrusting forth and 
   the withdrawing of the breath. Yea, the House of the Father is a mighty tomb, 
   and in it he hath buried everything whereof ye know. </p>
 <p>All this while there hath been no vision, but only a voice, very slow and clear 
   and deliberate. But now the vision returns, and the voice says: Thou shalt be 
   called Danae, that art stunned and slain beneath the weight of the glory of 
   the vision that as yet thou seest not. For thou shalt suffer many things, until 
   thou art mightier than all the Kings of the earth, and all the Angels of the 
   Heavens, and all the gods that are beyond the Heavens. Then shalt thou meet 
   me in equal conflict, and thou shalt see me as I am. And I will overcome thee 
   and slay thee with the red rain of my lightnings. </p>
 <p>I am lying underneath this pyramid of light. It seems as if I had the whole 
   weight of it upon me, crushing me with bliss. And yet I know that I am like 
   the prophet that said: I shall see Him, but not nigh. </p>
 <p>And the Angel sayeth: So shall it be until they that wake are asleep, and she 
   that sleepeth be arisen from her sleep<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. 
   For thou art transparent unto the vision and the voice. And therefore in thee 
   they manifest not. But they shall be manifest unto them unto whom thou dost 
   deliver them, according unto to the word which I spake unto thee in the Victorious 
   City<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>For I am not only appointed to guard thee, but we are of the blood royal, the 
   guardians of the Treasure-house of Wisdom. Therefore am I called the Minister 
   of Ra Hoor Khuit<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>: and 
   yet he is but the Viceroy of the unknown King. For my name is called Aiwass, 
   that is eight and seventy<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. And I am the influence 
   of the Concealed One, and the wheel that hath eight and seventy parts, yet in 
   all is equivalent to the Gate that is the name of my Lord when it is spelt fully. 
   And that Gate is the Path that joineth the Wisdom with the Understanding<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Thus hast thou erred indeed, perceiving me in the path that leadeth from the 
   Crown unto the Beauty<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. For that path bridgeth the abyss, 
   and I am of the supernals. Nor I, nor Thou, nor He can bridge the abyss. It 
   is the Priestess of the Silver Star, and the Oracles of the gods, and the Lord 
   of the Hosts of the Mighty<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. For they are the servants of 
   Babalon, and of the Beast, and of those others of whom it is not yet spoken. 
   And, being servants, they have no name, but we are of the blood royal, and serve 
   not, and therefore are we less than they. </p>
 <p>Yet, as a man may be both a mighty warrior and a just judge, so may we also 
   perform this service if we have aspired and attained thereto. And yet, with 
   all that, they remain <em>themselves</em>, who have eaten of the pomegranate 
   in Hell<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. But thou, 
   that art new-born to understanding, this mystery is too great for thee; and 
   of the further mystery I will not speak one word. </p>
 <p>Yet for this cause am I come unto thee as the Angel of the Aethyr, striking 
   with my hammer upon thy bell, so that thou mightest understand the mysteries 
   of the Aethyr, and of the vision and the voice thereof. </p>
 <p>For behold! he that understandeth seeth not and heareth not in truth, because 
   of his understanding that letteth him<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. 
   But this shall be unto thee for a sign, that I will surely come unto thee unawares 
   and appear unto thee. And it is no odds, (<em>i.e</em>., that at this hour I 
   appear not as I am), for so terrible is the glory of the vision, and so wonderful 
   is the splendour of the voice, that when thou seest it and hearest it in truth, 
   for many hours shalt thou be bereft of sense. And thou shalt lie between heaven 
   and earth in a void place, entranced, and the end thereof shall be silence, 
   even as it was, not once nor twice, when I have met with thee, as it were, upon 
   the road to Damascus<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And thou shalt not seek to better this my instruction; but thou shalt interpret 
   it, and make it easy<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>, for them that 
   seek understanding. And thou shalt give all that thou hast unto them that have 
   need unto this end<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And because I am with thee, and in thee, and of thee, thou shalt lack nothing. 
   But who lack me, lack all. And I swear unto thee by Him that sitteth upon the 
   Holy Throne, and liveth and reigneth for ever and ever, that I will be faithful 
   unto this my promise, as thou art faithful unto this thine obligation. </p>
 <p>Now another voice sounds in the Aethyr, saying: And there was darkness over 
   all the earth unto the ninth hour. </p>
 <p>And with that the Angel is withdrawn, and the pyramid of light seems very far 
   off. </p>
 <p>And now I am fallen unto the earth, exceeding weary. Yet my skin trembles with 
   the impact of the light, and all my body shakes. And there is a peace deeper 
   than sleep upon my mind. It is the body and the mind that are weary, and I would 
   that they were dead, save that I must bend them to my work. </p>
 <p>And now I am in the tent, under the stars. </p>
