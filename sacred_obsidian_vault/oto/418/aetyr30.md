 <h1 align="center">The Cry of the 30th Aethyr<br>
   Which is Called TEX<a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></h1>
 <p>I AM in a vast crystal cube in the form of the Great God Harpocrates. This 
   cube is surrounded by a sphere<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. About me are four 
   archangels in black robes, their wings and armour lined out in white. </p>
 <p>In the North<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> is a 
   book on whose back and front are A.M.B.Z. <a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a> in Enochian characters. 
   ({ENO:z}{ENO:b}{ENO:m}{ENO:a}) </p>
 <p>Within it is written: </p>
 <p>I AM, the surrounding of the four. </p>
 <p>Lift up your heads, O Houses of Eternity: for my Father goeth forth to judge 
   the World. One Light, let it become a thousand, and one sword ten thousand, 
   that no man hide him from my Father's eye in the Day of Judgment of my God. 
   Let the Gods hide themselves: let the Angels be troubled and flee away: for 
   the Eye of My Father is open, and the Book of the Aeons is fallen. </p>
 <p>Arise! Arise! Arise! Let the Light of the Sight of Time be extinguished: let 
   the Darkness cover all things: for my Father goeth forth to seek a spouse to 
   replace her who is fallen and defiled. </p>
 <p>Seal the book with the seals of the Stars Concealed: for the Rivers have rushed 
   together and the Name {HEB:Heh}{HEB:Vau}{HEB:Heh}{HEB:Yod}is broken in a thousand 
   pieces (against the Cubic Stone). </p>
 <p>Tremble ye, O Pillars of the Universe<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>, for Eternity is in travail of 
   a Terrible Child; she shall bring forth an universe of Darkness, whence shall 
   leap forth a spark that shall put his father to flight. </p>
 <p>The Obelisks are broken; the stars have rushed together: the Light hath plunged 
   into the Abyss: the Heavens are mixed with Hell. </p>
 <p>My Father shall not hear their Noise: His ears are closed: His eyes are covered 
   with the clouds of Night. </p>
 <p>The End! the End! the End: For the Eye of Shiva He hath opened: the Universe 
   is naked before Him: for the Aeon of Saturn leaneth toward the Bosom of Death<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>[Figure: This is an isosceles triangle with height about 7 times the base. 
   It extends with base on a true vertical from the left. A line extends vertically 
   upward from the apex, equal to the length of the base. A trefoliate of three 
   isosceles triangles of base slightly smaller than the first triangle and sides 
   equal to the first triangle is created at the upper tip of the line. The tree 
   component triangles of the terfolate meet the upper tip of the line with their 
   apices --- one vertically and two to right and left.]<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a> </p>
 <p>The Angel of the East<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a> 
   hath a book of red written in letters of Blue A.B.F.M.A.<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a> in Enochian ({ENO:a} 
   {ENO:m} {ENO:f} {ENO:b} {ENO:a}). The Book grows before my eyes and filleth 
   the Whole Heaven. </p>
 <p>Within: "It is Written, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord Thy God." </p>
 <p>I see above the Book a multitude of white-robed Ones from whom droppeth a great 
   rain of Blood<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>; but above them is a Golden Sun, 
   having an eye, whence a great Light<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>I turned me to the South<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>: 
   and read therein: </p>
 <p>Seal up the Book! Speak not that which thou seest and reveal it unto none: 
   for the ear is not framed that shall hear it: nor the tongue that can speak 
   it! </p>
 <p>O Lord God, blessed, blessed, blessed be Thou for ever! </p>
 <p>Thy Shadow is as great Light. </p>
 <p>Thy Name is as the Breath of Love across all Worlds. </p>
 <p>[Figure: This is a swastika or fylfot cross. It is widdershins, with each bend 
   going to the right when viewed down one arm from the center. All elements are 
   either vertical or horizontal, none diagonal.]<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a> </p>
 <p>(A vast Svastika is shewn unto me behind the Angel with the Book.) </p>
 <p>Rend your garments, O ye clouds! Uncover yourselves! for the Love of My Son! 
 </p>
 <p>Who are they that trouble thee? </p>
 <p>Who are they that slew thee? </p>
 <p>O Light! Come thou, who art joined with me to bruise the Dragon's head<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
   We, who are wedded, and the Earth perceiveth it not! </p>
 <p>O that Our Bed were seen of Men, that they might rejoice in My Fertility: that 
   My Sister might partake of My Great Light. </p>
 <p>O Light of God, when wilt thou find the heart of man --- write not! I would 
   not that men know the Sorrow of my Heart, Amen! </p>
 <p>I turned me to the West<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>, 
   and the Archangel bore a flaming Book, on which was written AN<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a> 
   in Enochian ({ENO:n}{ENO:a}). Within was drawn a fiery scorpion, yet cold withal<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Until the Book of the East be opened! </p>
 <p>Until the hour sound! </p>
 <p>Until the Voice vibrate! </p>
 <p>Until it pierce my Depth; </p>
 <p>Look not on High! </p>
 <p>Look not Beneath! </p>
 <p>For thou wilt find a life which is as Death: or a Death which should be infinite. 
 </p>
 <p>For Thou art submitted to the Four: Five thou shalt find, but Seven is lone 
   and far<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>For she is "lone and far", i.e., beyond the Abyss. </p>
 <p>O Lord God, let Thy Spirit hither unto me! </p>
 <p>For I am lost in the night of infinite pain: no hope: no God: no resurrection: 
   no end: I fall: I fear. </p>
 <p>O Saviour of the World, bruise Thou my Head with Thy foot to save the world, 
   that once again I touch Him whom I slew, that in my death I feel the radiance 
   and the heat of the moving of Thy Robes! </p>
 <p>Let us alone! What have we to do with Thee, Thou Jesus of Nazareth? </p>
 <p>Go! Go! </p>
 <p>If I keep silence --- Or if I speak each word is anguish without hope. </p>
 <p>And I heard the Aethyr cry aloud "Return! Return! Return! For the work 
   is ended; and the Book is shut; and let the glory be to God the Blessed for 
   ever in the Aeons, Amen." Thus far is the voice of TEX and no more.</p>
