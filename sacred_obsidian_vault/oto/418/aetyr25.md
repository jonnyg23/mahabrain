 <h1 align="center"><strong>The Cry of he 25th Aethyr, <br>
   Which is Called VTI</strong><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></h1>
 <p>There is nothing in the stone but the pale gold of the Rosy Cross. </p>
 <p>Now there comes an Angel with bright wings, that is the Angel of the 25th Aire. 
   And all the aire is a dark olive about him, like an alexandrite <a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a> stone. He bears a pitcher<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> 
   or amphora<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a> And now 
   there comes another Angel upon a white horse<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>, and yet again 
   another Angel upon a black bull<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. And now there comes a lion<a href="#7"><strong>7</strong></a> 
   and swallows the two latter angels up. The first angel goes to the lion and 
   closes his mouth<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. And behind them are arrayed a 
   great company of Angels with silver spears, like a forest. And the Angel says: 
   Blow, all ye trumpets, for I will loose my hands from the mouth of the lion, 
   and his roaring shall enkindle the worlds<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. Then the trumpets blow, and the 
   wind rises and whistles terribly. It is a blue wind with silver specks; and 
   it blows through the whole Aethyr. But through it one perceives the lion, which 
   has become as a raging flame<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. And he roareth in an unknown 
   tongue. But this is the interpretation thereof: Let the stars be burnt up in 
   the fire of my nostrils<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>! 
   Let all the gods and the archangels and the angels and the spirits that are 
   on the earth, and above the earth, and below the earth, that are in all the 
   heavens and in all the hells, let them be as motes dancing in the beam of mine 
   eye<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>! I am he that 
   swalloweth up death<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a> and victory<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. I have slain 
   the crowned goat<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>, 
   and drunk up the great sea<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. 
   Like the ash of dried leaves the worlds are blown before me. Thou hast passed 
   by me, and thou hast not known me. Woe unto thee, that I have not devoured thee 
   altogether! On my head is the crown, 419 rays<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a> far-darting. And my body is the 
   body of the Snake<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>, and my soul is the soul of the 
   Crowned Child<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. Though 
   an Angel in white robes leadeth me<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>, - who shall ride upon me but 
   the Woman of Abominations<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>? Who is the Beast<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>? Am not I one 
   more than he<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>? In 
   his hand is a sword that is a book<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. In his hand is a spear that is 
   a cup of fornication<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. Upon his mouth is set the great 
   and terrible seal<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>. And he hath the secret of V<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>. 
   His ten horns spring from five points<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>, and his eight heads<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a> 
   are as the charioteer of the West<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>. Thus doth the fire of the sun 
   temper the spear of Mars<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a>, and thus shall he be worshipped, 
   as the warrior lord of the sun<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a>. Yet in him is 
   the woman that devoureth with her water all the fire of God<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>. 
   Alas! my lord, thou art joined with him that knoweth not these things<a href="#34"><font size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>. 
   When shall the day come that men shall flock to this my gate, and fall into 
   my furious throat, a whirlpool of fire? This is hell unquenchable, and all they 
   shall be utterly consumed therein. Therefore is that asbestos unconsumable made 
   pure<a href="#35"><font size="1"><strong>35</strong></font></a>. Each of my 
   teeth<a href="#36"><font size="1"><strong>36</strong></font></a> is a letter 
   of the reverberating name. My tongue is a pillar of fire<a href="#37"><font size="1"><strong>37</strong></font></a>, 
   and from the glands of my mouth arise four pillars of water<a href="#38"><font size="1"><strong>38</strong></font></a>.TAOTZEM<a href="#39"><font size="1"><strong>39</strong></font></a>{SUP:19} is the 
   name by which I am blasphemed. My name thou shalt not know, lest thou pronounce 
   it and pass by. </p>
 <p>And now the Angel comes forward again and closes his mouth. </p>
 <p>All this time heavy blows have been raining upon me from invisible angels, 
   so that I am weighed down as with a burden greater than the world<a href="#40"><font size="1"><strong>40</strong></font></a>. I am altogether crushed. Great 
   millstones are hurled out of heaven upon me<a href="#41"><font size="1"><strong>41</strong></font></a>. 
   I am trying to crawl to the lion<a href="#42"><font size="1"><strong>42</strong></font></a>, and the ground is covered with 
   sharp knives. I cut myself at every inch<a href="#43"><font size="1"><strong>43</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And the voice comes: Why art thou there who art here<a href="#44"><font size="1"><strong>44</strong></font></a>? Hast thou not 
   the sign of the number<a href="#45"><font size="1"><strong>45</strong></font></a>, and the seal of the name<a href="#46"><font size="1"><strong>46</strong></font></a>, 
   and the ring of the eye<a href="#47"><font size="1"><strong>47</strong></font></a>? 
   Thou wilt not<a href="#48"><font size="1"><strong>48</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And I answered and said: I am a creature of earth, and ye would have me swim. 
 </p>
 <p>And the voice said: Thy fear is known; thine ignorance is known; thy weakness 
   is known; but thou art nothing in this matter. Shall the grain which is cast 
   into the earth by the hand of the sower debate within itself, saying, am I oats 
   or barley? Bondslave of the curse, we give nothing, we take all. Be thou content. 
   That which thou art, thou art. Be content<a href="#49"><font size="1"><strong>49</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And now the lion passeth over through the Aethyr with the crowned beast upon 
   his back, and the tail of the lion goes on instead of stopping, and on each 
   hair of the tail is something or other --- sometimes a little house, sometimes 
   a planet, at other times a town. Then there is a great plain with soldiers fighting 
   upon it, and an enormously high mountain carved into a thousand temples, and 
   more houses and fields and trees, and great cities with wonderful buildings 
   in them, statues and columns and public buildings generally. This goes on and 
   on and on and on and on and on and on all on the hairs of this lion's tail<a href="#50"><font size="1"><strong>50</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And then there is the tuft of his tail, which is like a comet, but the head 
   is a new universe, and each hair streaming away from it is a Milky Way. </p>
 <p>And then there is a pale stern figure, enormous, enormous, bigger than all 
   that universe is, in silver armour, with a sword and a pair of balances<a href="#51"><font size="1"><strong>51</strong></font></a>. That is only vague. All has gone 
   into stone-gray, blank. </p>
 <p>There is nothing. </p>
 <p>Ain el Hajel. November 25, 1909. 8:40-9:40 p.m.</p>
 <p>(There were two voices in all this Cry, one behind the other --- or, one was 
   the speech, and the other the meaning. And the voice that was the speech was 
   simply a roaring, one tremendous noise, like a mixture of thunder and water-falls 
   and wild beasts and bands and artillery. And yet it was articulate, though I 
   cannot tell you what a single word was. But the meaning of the voice --- the 
   second voice --- was quite silent, and put the ideas directly into the brain 
   of the Seer, as if by touch. It is not certain whether the millstones and the 
   sword-strokes that rained upon him were not these very sounds and ideas.) </p>
