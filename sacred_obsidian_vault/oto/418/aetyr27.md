 <h1 align="center"><strong>The Cry of the 27th Aethyr, <br>
   Which is Called ZAA</strong><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a> 
 </h1>
 <p>There is an angel with rainbow wings, and his dress is green<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a> 
   with silver, a green veil over silver<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a> armour. Flames of many- coloured 
   fire dart from him in all directions. It is a woman of some thirty years old, 
   and she has the moon for a crest, and the moon is blazoned on her heart, and 
   her sandals are curved silver, like the moon. </p>
 <p>And she cries: Lonely am I and cold in the wilderness of the stars<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>. 
   For I am the queen of all them that dwell in Heaven, and the queen of all them 
   that are pure upon earth, and the queen of all the sorcerers of hell<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>I am the daughter of Nuit, the lady of the stars. And I am the Bride of them 
   that are vowed unto loneliness<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. And I am the mother 
   of the Dog Cerberus<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. One person am I, and three gods<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And thou who hast blasphemed me shalt suffer knowing me. For I am cold as thou 
   art cold, and burn with thy fire<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>. 
   Oh, when shall the war of the Aires and the elements be accomplished<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a>? 
 </p>
 <p>Radiant are these falchions of my brothers, invisibly about me, but the might 
   of the aethyrs beneath my feet beareth me down. And they avail not to sever 
   the Kamailow<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a>. There is one 
   in green armour, with green eyes, whose sword is of vegetable fire<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. 
   They shall avail me. My son is he<a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>, ---and how shall I bear him that 
   have not known man? </p>
 <p>All this time intolerable rays are shooting forth to beat me back or destroy 
   me; but I am encased in an egg of blue-violet, and my form is the form of a 
   man with the head of a golden hawk<a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. 
   While I have been observing this, the goddess has kept up a continuous wail, 
   like the baying of a thousand hounds<a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>; and now her 
   voice is deep and guttural and hoarse, and she breathes very rapidly words that 
   I cannot hear. I can hear some of them now. </p>
 <p>UNTU LA LA ULULA UMUNA TOFA LAMA LE LI NA AHR IMA TAHARA ELULA ETFOMA UNUNA 
   ARPETI ULU ULU ULU MARABAN ULULU MAHATA ULU ULU LAMASTANA<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And then her voice rises to a shriek, and there is a cauldron<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a> 
   boiling in front of her; and the flames under the cauldron are like unto zinc 
   flames<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>, and in the cauldron is the Rose, 
   the Rose of 49 petals<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>, seething in it. Over the cauldron 
   she has arched her rainbow wings; and her face is bent over the cauldron, and 
   she is blowing opalescent silvery rings on to the Rose; and each ring as it 
   touches the water bursts into flame, and the Rose takes new colours<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>And now she lifts her head, and raises her hands to heaven, and cries: O Mother<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>, 
   wilt thou never have compassion on the children of earth? Was it not enough 
   that the Rose should be red with the blood of thine heart<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>, 
   and that its petals should be by 7 and by 7? </p>
 <p>She is weeping, weeping<a href="#24"><font size="1"><strong>24</strong></font></a>. 
   And the tears grow and fill the whole stone with moons<a href="#25"><font size="1"><strong>25</strong></font></a>. I can see nothing 
   and hear nothing for the tears, though she keeps on praying. "Take of these 
   pearls<a href="#26"><font size="1"><strong>26</strong></font></a>, treasure them 
   in thine heart. Is not the Kingdom of the Abyss accurst?" She points downward 
   to the cauldron; and now in it there is the head of a most cruel dragon<a href="#27"><font size="1"><strong>27</strong></font></a>, black and corrupted. 
   I watch, and watch; and nothing happens. </p>
 <p>And now the dragon rises out of the cauldron, very long and slim (like Japanese 
   Dragons, but infinitely more terrible), and he blots out the whole sphere of 
   the stone<a href="#28"><font size="1"><strong>28</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>Then suddenly all is gone, and there is nothing in the stone save brilliant 
   white light and flecks like sparks of golden fire; and there is a ringing, as 
   if bells were being used for anvils. And there is a perfume which I cannot describe; 
   it is like nothing that one can describe, but the suggestion is like lignum 
   aloes<a href="#29"><font size="1"><strong>29</strong></font></a>. And now all 
   these things are there at once in the same place and time<a href="#30"><font size="1"><strong>30</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Now a veil of olive and silver<a href="#31"><font size="1"><strong>31</strong></font></a> is drawn over the stone, only 
   I hear the voice of the angel<a href="#32"><font size="1"><strong>32</strong></font></a> receding, very sweet and faint 
   and sorrowful, saying: Far off and lonely in the secret stone is the unknown, 
   and interpenetrated is the knowledge with the will and the understanding. I 
   am alone. I am lost, because I am all and in all; and my veil is woven of the 
   green earth and the web of stars. I love; and I am denied, for I have denied 
   myself. Give me those hands, put them against my heart. Is it not cold? Sink, 
   sink, the abyss of time remains. It is not possible that one should come to 
   ZAA. Give me thy face. Let me kiss it with my cold kisses. Ah! Ah! Ah! Fall 
   back from me. The word, the word of the aeon is MAKHASHANAH<a href="#33"><font size="1"><strong>33</strong></font></a>{SUP:1}. And these 
   words shalt thou say backwards: ARARNAY OBOLO MAHARNA TUTULU NOM LAHARA EN NEDIEZO 
   LO SAD FONUSA SOBANA ARANA BINUF LA LA LA ARPAZNA UOHULU<a href="#34"><font size="1"><strong>34</strong></font></a>{SUP:2}. when thou wilt call my 
   burden unto appearance, for I who am the Virgin goddess am the pregnant goddess, 
   and I have cast down my burden even unto the borders of the universe<a href="#35"><font size="1"><strong>35</strong></font></a>{SUP:3}. They 
   that blaspheme me are stoned, and my veil<a href="#36"><font size="1"><strong>36</strong></font></a>{SUP:4} is fallen 
   about me even unto the end of time<a href="#37"><font size="1"><strong>37</strong></font></a>{SUP:5}. </p>
 <p>Now there arises a great raging of thousands and thousands of mighty warriors 
   flashing through the aethyr so thickly that nothing is to be seen but their 
   swords, which are like blue-gray plumes. And the noise is confused, thousands 
   of battle-cries harmonizing to a roar, like the roar of a monstrous river in 
   flood. And all the stone is dull, dull gray. The life is gone from it<a href="#39"><font size="1"><strong>39</strong></font></a>{SUP:1}. 
 </p>
 <p>There is no more to see. </p>
 <p>Sidi Aissa, Algeria. November 24, 1909, 8-9 p.m. </p>

     on one whose Formula is 3: 8x = 3{square x}. The Seer "knew" that 
     this Word was <em>not</em> the correct Word, which is Abrahadabra = 418. But 
     on writing it down in Hebrew, as above, he saw that it was the correct word 
     after all. Observe that this proves the Angel to have been an Intelligence 
     not of the Seer's conscious mind. Had he given the Word which the Seer knew, 
     it might have been derived from his subconscious Self. Furthermore, this Word 
     contains more than the mere 418 because of its 8 letters suiting the special 
     Formula required by this particular Angel, whereas the other Word is a general 
     Formula, being of 11 letters, all Magick being referred to 11. so far as ABRAHADABRA 
     is specialized, it refers to the Work of 5x = 6{square x}, there being 5 alephs 
     and 6 other letters. In the Latin script also Makhashanah does have 11 letters.
