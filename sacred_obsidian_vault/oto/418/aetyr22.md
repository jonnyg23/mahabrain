 <p align="center"><font size="6"><strong>The Cry of the 22nd Aethyr,<br>
   Which is Called LIN</strong></font><a href="#1"><font size="1"><strong>1</strong></font></a></p>
 <p>There comes first into the stone the mysterious table of forty-nine squares<a href="#2"><font size="1"><strong>2</strong></font></a>. 
   It is surrounded by an innumerable company of angels; these angels are of all 
   kinds, --- some brilliant and flashing as gods, down to elemental creatures. 
   The light comes and goes on the tablet; and now it is steady, and I perceive 
   that each letter of the tablet is composed of forty-nine other letters, in a 
   language which looks like that of Honorius; but when I would read, the letter 
   that I look at becomes indistinct at once. </p>
 <p>And now there comes an Angel, to hide the tablet with his mighty wing. This 
   Angel has all the colours mingled in his dress; his head is proud and beautiful; 
   his headdress is of silver and red and blue and gold and black, like cascades 
   of water, and in his left hand he has a pan-pipe of the seven holy metals, upon 
   which he plays<a href="#3"><font size="1"><strong>3</strong></font></a>. I cannot 
   tell you how wonderful the music is, but it is so wonderful that one only lives 
   in one's ears; one cannot see anything any more. </p>
 <p>Now he stops playing and moves with his finger in the air. His finger leaves 
   a trail of fire of every colour, so that the whole Aire is become like a web 
   of mingled lights. But through it all drops dew<a href="#4"><font size="1"><strong>4</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>(I can't describe these things at all. Dew doesn't represent what I mean in 
   the least. For instance, these drops of dew are enormous globes, shining like 
   the full moon, only perfectly transparent, as well as perfectly luminous.) </p>
 <p>And now he shows the tablet again, and he says: As there are 49 letters in 
   the tablet, so are there 49 kinds of cosmos in every thought of God. And there 
   are 49 interpretations of every cosmos, and each interpretation is manifested 
   in 49 ways. Thus also are the calls 49<a href="#5"><font size="1"><strong>5</strong></font></a>, but to each call 
   there are 49 visions. And each vision is composed of 49 elements, except in 
   the 10th Aethyr, that is accursed, and that hath 42<a href="#6"><font size="1"><strong>6</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>All this while the dewdrops have turned into cascades of gold finer than the 
   eyelashes of a little child<a href="#7"><font size="1"><strong>7</strong></font></a>. And though the 
   extent of the Aethyr is so enormous, one perceives each hair separately, as 
   well as the whole thing at once<a href="#8"><font size="1"><strong>8</strong></font></a>. 
   And now there is a mighty concourse of angels rushing toward me from every side, 
   and they melt upon the surface of the egg in which I am standing in the form 
   of the god Kneph<a href="#9"><font size="1"><strong>9</strong></font></a>, so 
   that the surface of the egg is all one dazzling blaze of liquid light. </p>
 <p>Now I move up against the tablet, --- I cannot tell you with what rapture. 
   And all the names of God, that are not known even to the angels<a href="#10"><font size="1"><strong>10</strong></font></a>, 
   clothe me about. </p>
 <p>All the seven senses are transmuted into one sense, and that sense is dissolved 
   in itself ...<a href="#11"><font size="1"><strong>11</strong></font></a><strong> </strong>(Here occurs 
   Samadhi.) ... Let me speak, O God; let me declare it ... all. It is useless; 
   my heart faints, my breath stops. There is no link between me and P . . .<a href="#12"><font size="1"><strong>12</strong></font></a> I withdraw myself. 
   I see the table again. </p>
 <p>(He was behind the table for a very long time<a href="#13"><font size="1"><strong>13</strong></font></a>. O.V.) </p>
 <p>And all the table burns with intolerable light; there has been no such light 
   in any of the Aethyrs until now. And now the table draws me back into itself; 
   I am no more. </p>
 <p>My arms were out in the form of a cross, and that Cross was extended, blazing 
   with light into infinity. I myself am the minutest point in it. This is <em>the 
   birth of form</em><a href="#14"><font size="1"><strong>14</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>I am encircled by an immense sphere of many-coloured bands; it seems it is 
   the sphere of the Sephiroth projected in the three dimensions. This is <em>the 
   birth of death</em><a href="#15"><font size="1"><strong>15</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Now in the centre within me is a glowing sun. That is <em>the birth of hell</em><a href="#16"><font size="1"><strong>16</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Now all that is swept away, washed away by the table. It is the virtue of the 
   table to sweep everything away. It is the letter </p>
 <p>I in this Aethyr that gives this vision, and L is its purity, and N is its 
   energy<a href="#17"><font size="1"><strong>17</strong></font></a>. Now everything 
   is confused, for I invoked the Mind, that is disruption<a href="#18"><font size="1"><strong>18</strong></font></a>. 
   Every Adept who beholds this vision is corrupted by mind. Yet it is by virtue 
   of mind that he endures it, and passes on, if so be that he pass on. Yet there 
   is nothing higher than this, for it is perfectly balanced in itself. I cannot 
   read a word of the holy Table, for the letters of the Table are all wrong. They 
   are only the shadows of shadows. And whoso beholdeth this Table with this rapture, 
   is light. The true word for light hath seven letters. They are the same as ARARITA, 
   transmuted<a href="#19"><font size="1"><strong>19</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>There is a voice in this Aethyr, but it cannot be spoken. The only way one 
   can represent it is as a ceaseless thundering of the word Amen. It is not a 
   repetition of Amen, because there is no time. It is one Amen continuous<a href="#20"><font size="1"><strong>20</strong></font></a>. 
 </p>
 <p>Shall mine eye fade before thy glory? I am the eye. That is why the eye is 
   seventy<a href="#21"><font size="1"><strong>21</strong></font></a>. You can never understand why, 
   except in this vision<a href="#22"><font size="1"><strong>22</strong></font></a>. </p>
 <p>And now the table recedes from me. Far, far it goes, streaming with light. 
   And there are two black angels bending over me, covering me with their wings, 
   shutting me up into the darkness; and I am lying in the Pastos of our Father 
   Christian Rosenkreutz, beneath the Table in the Vault of seven sides. And I 
   hear these words: </p>
 <p>The voice of the Crowned Child, the Speech of the Babe that is hidden in the 
   egg of blue<a href="#23"><font size="1"><strong>23</strong></font></a>. (Before me is the flaming Rosy 
   Cross.) I have opened mine eye, and the universe is dissolved before me, for 
   force is mine upper eye-lid and matter is my lower eye- lid<strong>24</strong>. 
   I gaze into the seven spaces, and there is naught<strong>25</strong>. </p>
 <p>The rest of it comes without words; and then again: </p>
 <p>I have gone forth to war, and I have slain him that sat upon the sea, crowned 
   with the winds<strong>26</strong>. I put forth my power and he was broken. I 
   withdrew my power and he was ground into fine dust<strong>27</strong>. </p>
 <p>Rejoice with me, O ye Sons of the Morning; stand with me upon the Throne of 
   Lotus<strong>28</strong>; gather yourselves up unto me, and we shall play together 
   in the fields of light. I have passed into the Kingdom of the West after my 
   Father<strong>29</strong>. </p>
 <p>Behold! where are now the darkness and the terror and the lamentation? For 
   ye are born into the new Aeon; ye shall not suffer death<strong>30</strong>. 
   Bind up your girdles of gold! Wreathe yourselves with garlands of my unfading 
   flowers! In the nights we will dance together, and in the morning we will go 
   forth to war; for, as my Father liveth that was dead, so do I live and shall 
   never die<strong>31</strong>. </p>
 <p>And now the table comes rushing back. It covers the whole stone, but this time 
   it pushes me before it, and a terrible voice cries: Begone! Thou hast profaned 
   the mystery; thou hast eaten of the shew-bread; thou hast spilt the consecrated 
   wine<strong>32</strong>! Begone! For the Voice is accomplished. Begone! For 
   that which was open is shut. And thou shalt not avail to open it, saving by 
   virtue of him whose name is one, whose spirit is one, whose individuum is one, 
   and whose permutation is one<strong>33</strong>; whose light is one, whose life 
   is one, whose love is one. For though thou art joined to the inmost mystery 
   of the heaven, thou must accomplish the sevenfold task of the earth, even as 
   thou sawest the Angels from the greatest unto the least. And of all this shalt 
   thou take back with thee but a little part, for the sense shall be darkened, 
   and the shrine re-veiled. Yet know this for thy reproof, and for the stirring 
   up of discontent in them whose swords are of lath<strong>34</strong>, that in 
   every word of this vision is concealed the key of many mysteries, even of being, 
   and of knowledge, and of bliss<strong>35</strong>; of will, of courage, of wisdom, 
   and of silence<strong>36</strong>, and of that which, being all these, is greater 
   than all these. Begone! For the night of life is fallen upon thee. And the veil 
   of light hideth that which is. </p>
 <p>With that, I suddenly see the world as it is, and I am very sorrowful. </p>
 <p>Bou-Sada.<br>

   from one room into another. Regained normal consciousness completely and immediately.)

     of the sentence: "One is His beginning; One is his Individuality; His

     identify every idea with its opposite; thus being released from the obsession 
     of thinking any one of them as "true" (and therefore binding); one 
     can withdraw oneself from the whole sphere of the Ruach. See <em>Liber 813, 
     vel Ararita.</em> Contrast each verse of Cap. I with the corresponding verse 
     of Cap. II for the first of these methods. Thus in Cap. III (stil verse by 
     verse correspondence) the Quintessence of the ideas is extracted; and in Cap. 
     IV they are withdrawn each one into the one beyond it. In Cap. V they have 
     disappeared into the Method itself. In Cap. VI they reappear in the Form appointed 
     by the Will of the Adept. Lastly, in Cap. VII they are dissolved, one into 
     the next until all finally disappear in the Fire Qadosh, the Quintessence 
     of Reality.</font></li>
