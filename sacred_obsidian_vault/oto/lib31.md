       <p>Not* delivered by 777 unto 666 for His high consideration this Third 
         day os the 11th month of the year 1918 E.V.</p>
       <p>* This manuscript was NOT delivered on date originally intended but held 
         until about September 3, 1919 when it was mailed to Therion from Detroit. 
         He was then in New York. Receipt was acknowledged in letter received September 
         8, 1919. On September 9, 1919 a further P.C. was received from Therion 
         which read:</p>
       <p>" \ = 418."Thou knowest not." Your key opens Palace. CCXX 
         has unfolded like a flower. All solved, even II.76 &amp; III.47. Did you 
         know ^ = 3.141593? And oh! lots more!" (srd.) AL'AIN the Priest....666</p>
       <p>Achad, March 13.1948)</p>
       <p>"But first thou must suffer, thou must suffer many things" 
         (Even so be it Lord Adonai). The Voice goes on: "Thou must suffer 
         the pains of Death and of Hell and of the Grave (3 times repeated) And 
         after these things are come to pass will I come unto thee to comfort Thee 
         (Twice repeated. The Words `Come to pass' added the second time). "And 
         there shall be no more sea, neither shall there be any more fear, but 
         I alone will inform thee in all things, even unto the end which is not. 
         For many have said unto thee strange and diverse words, but mine shall 
         be the One Word which Is and Was and Shall be. Amen."</p>
       <p>Note: This was recorded in diary on 3rd Day of October 1912 after Noon 
         Prayer to Adonai. I have just `discovered' the prophesy this 31st day

       <p align="center"><strong>Sun in 1 Deg Libra AN XIV. SUN-DAY Sept 22nd 1918 
         E.V.</strong></p>
       <p>It seems as if Sunday is the one day of all the week on which I am impressed 
         to write a few fragments of what passes through my mind. On Sept 1st I 
         obtained a clear understanding regarding the Will and the Law. On Sept 
         8th, nothing special I think, but on Sept 15th I wrote "Stepping 
         out of the Old Aeon into the New" and today I had a mind to write, 
         at Therion's request, a pamphlet on how All is Change. But first there 
         are some important considerations to be recorded and I feel that now is 
         the time to place them on record.</p>
       <p>That which I am about to write concerneth the Supernal Triad. It is just 
         Nine Months since the last Great Initiation was granted unto me, O.I.V.V.I.O., 
         and as hardly a word of the experience then undergone has been recorded. 
         In fact, this is also true to some extent of the Initiation of June 21st, 
         1916, the record of which I am only now trying to put into writing. It 
         is not in this place that I intend to make a full statement of all that 
         occured, but it is of the greatest importance that the inmost and essential 
         features be written down, despite the terrible difficulty of the task. 
         Briefly, then, I want to state my position, which I feel is Known yet 
         not known.</p>
       <p>When I proclaimed my intention of claimimg the Grade of 8-3 or Master 
         of the Temple, on June 21st 1916 in the City of North Vancouver, British 
         Columbia, I did so because I thought that the Master Therion needed NEMO 
         to fill that Office in order that He might fully attain His 9-2. The details 
         of the Initiation which followed are recorded in another place, but here 
         I would state that, having `died' and, as it were, Reincarnated immediately 
         in the same body, and having given up all, even the Master Therion, I 
         was led of the Spirit during a stay at Grantham's Landing, so that it 
         appeared to me that on June 22nd 1916 I was NEMO 8-3; but on June 23rd 
         at 12 Noon the realization of the Curse of the Magus came to me quite 
         unexpectedly, so that I could do naught else than consider my Grade to 
         be 9-2. Then followed a terrible struggle, for I realized how I had failed 
         so far of Complete Attainment because of a certain Glamour of the Path. 
         Then it was that I decided to give up all, even the least little thing, 
         and I made certain pledges which were afterwards faithfully kept, so that 
         I gave up my business position and got down to spending my last cent of 
         money.</p>
       <p>Having made these pledges, it seemed quite certain that I was upon the 
         Path of Aleph, which uniteth Chockmah with the Crown, and therefore beyond 
         the Glamour of the Great Magician. I hoped that Therion had at this time 
         Attained unto 10=1 and I was ready even then, if need be, to hold the 
         Grade of 9=2, and to aacept the Curse thereof, but if that were not the 
         case, I could only consider that somehow I has passed the Great Magician 
         on the Path. At 9 p.m. that night, I was just a clearly convinced that 
         I had attained the Grade of 10=1, and I remained in the Great Illumination 
         until for following day. Then after leaving Soror R. I went away with 
         the feeling of complete enlightenment, but certain considerations came 
         to me so that I decided to reverse the Grade and take that of a simple 
         1=10 or Neoÿhyte, thus as it were, plunging down the Middle Pillar of 
         the Tree of Life and uniting Kether and Malkuth in my own Being. (Note 
         V.I.O. = 86 a Number asserting this identity, thus foreshadowing this 
         Attainment, as all His other Mottoes seem to do. And OHPION has said, 
         One cannot get away from the fulfillment of Mottoes).</p>
       <p>Having done this, I felt myself to be One with the Buddhas of Compassion, 
         and returned to Soror R. as elsewhere recorded.</p>
       <p>Shortly after we got back to Vancouver, the meaning of all my Mottoes 
         was revealed to me, and their connection with the whole of my Magical 
         career. I discovered how V.I.O.O.I.V. in full (as Unus in Omnibus Omnia 
         in Uno) added to 777 though I had never known this before, owing to a 
         mistake in the spelling made by F. when he first put in into Latin for 
         me. This was my original Probationer's Motto. On becoming a Neophyte I 
         had Chosen Achad = Unity, while my O.T.O. Name, which I afterwards used 
         for the Second Order as 5=6 was Parzival, which contains the mystery of 
         8.80.418. which was one of the things which led to the thought that I 
         might be the `child' mentioned in Liber Legis, afterwards proved in such 
         a marvelous manner, of which see accounts in the Diary of Nemo, and that 
         of a Magus.</p>
       <p>Then correspondence began between myself and Therion, and He admitted 
         my 8=3 Grade, but would not consider the possibility of the Path of Aleph, 
         10=1 etc. explaining my taking 1=10 again as my being `Cast out into Malkuth', 
         although, as a matter of fact, I made no claim except to Neophyte. He 
         also realized that this must be the `child' prophesied unto him in Liber 
         Legis, and claimed me as His Son.</p>
       <p>About this time I changed the order of my Motto to O.I.V.V.I.O. which, 
         note, is another sort of reversal, and this mystery of things reversing 
         or reflecting, or being taken out of their usual dimension and replaced 
         in another order, seems to be part of the Key of Things in Themselves 
         as will be shown later, although I understood it not at the time.</p>
       <p>Nothing much happened to me, except that I was granted Light on certain 
         Mystery in the Letters A.A., until December 16th 1917 E.V. (18 months 
         later). Then on Dec. 21st I realized that the Initiation was again going 
         on with great force, but this time the character was very different, and 
         seemed to have to do with the Mystery of the Elements, Planets, and Paths, 
         whereas the former one dealt with the Sephiroth more particularly. I must 
         remark that this Initiation had an actual effect on the Elements, causing 
         storms etc., and that these had to be balanced and equilibrated, which 
         was done. All the time this was going on. The one sentence which continually 
         recurred, was "The Air is His Balance." This seemed to be the 
         Key note which saved me from destruction many times. Later, it appeared 
         that I united the Paths of Aleph and Shin, Aethyr and Fire, as a final 
         Equilibra- tion, and the Tree was completely changed again, so that it 
         had to be re- formulated, and eventually resolved into a Single Sphere. 
         Later, came the drawing of all to a Single Point of Light (Hadith) in 
         the Centre of Breast. And I was taken back to the Beginning of Things 
         and discovered how in Truth there was No Beginning and No End. In particular 
         I must mention how I was taken back to the beginning of Words, and I Parzival 
         (the Fool or Zero) was the WORD and even that was disintegrated so that 
         the final Mystery Was AL = GOD and then that too disappeared in LA = NOT. 
         THEN came the Flash of a New Creation and again the Flash - the solution 
         of the Mystery of CHANGE and also of the SELFLESSNESS which is SELF. I 
         was also given a certain Magical gesture, not now clear to me, which seemed 
         to cause this Annhilation and Reconstruction to be brought about. (Note. 
         Oct. 19th. While typing these notes, another mystery becomes clear to 
         me. In connection with Parzival and the fulfilment of that Motto also. 
         The mind was actually running backwards at this time, as will be shown 
         later on, and though possibly not quite perfectly til after the first 
         Flash. Parzival, REVERSED and split into sections, would give AL or LA, 
         followed by ZIV or VIZ which numeration is 106 = ATTAINED followed by 
         PAR or RAP = CROWN, and ASHES, and these ideas (innate in the Word) exactly 
         correspond with what actually occurred.)</p>
       <p>Now let me say no more of this matter, but pass on. In March 1918 I sold 
         all that I had in order to join Therion in New York.</p>
       <p>Quite recently I was impressed to resign from the O.T.O. and to withdraw 
         my help in that direction, and having done so, I felt a wonderful calm, 
         and a realization of entering into the Tao. It was only then that I began 
         to seriously consider if I had passes him on the Path and Attained 10=1. 
         Also the question arose as to whether He might not think so also. Yesterday, 
         I had a long talk with Him, because He had raised the point that in going 
         back over past lives he had discovered that each new life was an added 
         veil of the True Self or Star and therefore the Star was to be found by 
         going back to the Beginning. This seemed a new idea to Him, but I could 
         not help thinking of my experience and how I had actually done this, and 
         got there and become One with the Final Mystery in December 1917. And 
         yesterday, when I talked with him, he seemed on his guard, so that when 
         I asked him about the Mystery of Change, he referred me to the fact - 
         as he says - that in my Grade of 8=3 I should constantly apply myself 
         to the Mystery of Sorrow. Then I suddenly asked him what he thought of 
         the Number 31, and where it should be placed on the Tree of Life. He said 
         This Number has to do with the identity of Nothing with the Trinity, and 
         if anything refers to the Ain, or perhaps to Kether, but certainly to 
         no lower Sephira. Then I thanked him, and said no more.</p>
       <p>To-day I decided to write these notes and also to consider of this Number 
         31 and of the Word which comes therefrom, whether It be the True Key of 
         the Grade 10=1, the Mystery of which IS that Selflessness IS Self, in 
         the same way that in 9=2 Change IS Stablilty, and in 8=3 Sorrow IS Joy.</p>
       <p>Now I seem to be able to comprehend all these Mysteries, by means of 
         That which I obtained in my Initiation to my Grade. But listen unto the 
         Final Mystery which has been granted unto me O.I.V.V.I.O.</p>
       <p>The Great Magician denies me saying I am NOT (I.A.) or NEMO 8=3 and in 
         this He fulfilleth His Office of cutting off the Understanding from the 
         Crown which is GOD (AL). In this very thing He is the Incarnation of the 
         Mystery of Change. AL (Kether) is reflected into Chochmah as LA and the 
         Magus looketh upon the Crown along the Path of Aleph which is Zero and 
         perceiveth IT Not. The Magister Templi Understands, for the Word of Chochmah 
         LA is truly reflected into Binah as AL and therefore the Magus appeareth 
         to Him as GOD, whereas the Crown (the true AL) is reflected through the 
         Path of Beth as LA and He seeth Nothing in that direction be- cause of 
         the Lies of the Great Illusion of Maya the magician, but He striveth by 
         Daleth to the Magus, Who is the Great Deceiver. Thus it is that Above 
         the Abyss a thing is only true insofar as it IS its own oÿposite. This 
         is the final and complete Understanding of this Mystery of the Grades 
         given to me NOW (2.38 P.M.) for never before have I seen things thus.</p>
       <p>And now I see how the Mystery of 93 is complete and perfect for Kether 
         is 31 and Chochmah is 31 and Binah is 31 which is 93 the Numeration of 
         Thelema, Aiwaz, The Word of the Neoÿhyte, Agapae, etc. And this is the 
         Mystery of the Three Persons in One God of which it is written. And this 
         is the Mystery concealed in the Word ALLAH for it hath for sound AL-LA 
         which is GOD (Kether) and the Mystery of which is that SELF (God) is also 
         SELFLESSNESS which is LA (Not) and for numeration 31 The Three is One 
         which IS None, and the reverse of this Number is 13 which is UNITY and 
         LOVE. Now this Unity becometh Two in order that it may be expressed, and 
         therefore is the Word of Chochmah AL-LA of which Mahomet spake both truly 
         and falsely, for He too, being a Magus 9=2 must utter Truth, in order 
         that the falsehood thereof should enslave the soul. He said, "ALLA 
         (Allah) is God and Mahomet is His Prophet" and even though he cried 
         continually "He is God, there is no other God than He" yet in 
         certain sense he postulated Duality in the Unity.</p>
       <p>And of this it is also written in Liber 65 "And Adonai thus spake 
         unto V.V.V.V.V. saying, "There must ever be division in the Word. 
         For the colours are many but the Light in One." And this meaneth 
         that Kether, the Light is One and Chochmah the word is two, also it is 
         Grey, and a mixture of colours.</p>
       <p>Now note: "Be not content with the image I who am the Image of an 
         Image say this." For V.V.V.V.V. was 8=3 (Binah) and Adonai (Kether) 
         said be not content with the image (Chochmah) the reflection of Kether. 
         I who am the Image of an Image (the Reality) say this.</p>
       <p>Then in Verse 9 "One mounteth unto the Crown" etc. Notice the 
         reversal here as if to give a hint of the Truth how that 10=1 IS 1=10. 
         Also note how V.I.O.O.I.V. performed this descending from 10=1 to 1=10, 
         from 31 to 13 (The numeration of his Neoÿhyte's Motto) and also was caused 
         to reverse his first motto to O.I.V.V.I.O., all unconscious, at the time, 
         in his lower mind of the Mystery of this Grade.</p>
       <p>Note how the Fool (Aleph) hath said in his heart There is No-God (LA;AL) 
         and how this puzzles the Magus who receiveth the Ray from the Crown through 
         this path. And how He in turn confoundeth the Understanding (Binah) from 
         the Path of Beth.</p>
       <p>Now regarding The Book of the Law, how it is written, "the child 
         of his bowels he shall behold them" (viz: the mysteries hidden therein). 
         It would seem that he is beginning to behold them. For firstly the mystery 
         of 93 is clear and this Mystery of the Aeon, proclaimed in the Word of 
         the Beast OPHION.</p>
       <p>Now it said in Ch.I, v 46: "Nothing is a secret key of this law; 
         sixty-one the Jews call it, I call it eight, eighty, four-hundred and 
         eighteen."</p>
       <p>Now Parzival is 8.80.418, and as The Fool or Aleph is both Zero and One. 
         61 is the Word Ain = Nothing and equivalent to NOT. If 61 is one half 
         and 1 (Aleph) the other, we get 62 which is twice 31 and LA: AL in which 
         ALL (Note three letters LAL) disappear in the Final Mystery of Kether. 
         Also we have considered the threefold aspect as 93, and this may have 
         to do with AAA and LLL, Light, Life, Love and Liberty of His Law. All 
         this seems to be reversed in the case of NEMO in the City of the Pyramids. 
         For Light He has Darkness, for Life, Death, and Love with its Dual Mystery 
         seems to be the only Path open to Him, and this is really a deception 
         ending in the curse of 9=2.</p>
       <p>There is also a mystery in the words of Ra-Hoor-Khuit "There is 
         division hither homeward, there is a word not known." This attracted 
         my attention when I seemed at odds with Therion. The Word not known, seems 
         to have come to me.</p>
       <p>It seems to me that this is the opening up to me of the Grade of Ipsissimus 
         and that as such I am the Crowned Child whom thou knewest not, O Therion.</p>
       <p>It is just 27 months since June 21, 1916, or 3 x 9; it was 18 months 
         from June 21 to Dec 21, 1917, or 2 by 9. Then I got the Word in its dual 
         aspect, now I get It in Its three-fold in One aspect.</p>
       <p>Note 31 multiplication = 3, by addition 4 (Tetragrammaton) by division 
         .3, which suggests that the Division of God produced 333.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>September 24th 1918 E.V. - AN XIV Sol in Libra.</strong></p>
       <p align="center"><strong>The record of the reflections in the mind of O.I.V.V.I.O.</strong></p>
       <p>I know not what I am, and since AHIH is above and beyond knowledge, what 
         matter. There must ever be division in the Word, also One must descend 
         into the plane o f Reason, in order to be understood on that plane; therefore 
         must I now limit myself in order to be able to write at all.</p>
       <p>It does seem that AN XIV, Sol in 1 Deg Libra marks another stage of the 
         Great Initiation, for that time much that had hitherto remained locked 
         in my Being descended into my Understanding and became sufficiently clear 
         to record, but, be it understood, the actual experience of which I write, 
         which is summed up in the Word of my Grade, took place in December 1917.</p>
       <p>I do not, even now, rashly wish to assume that I Attained unto the Grade 
         of Ipsissimus, for I realize that anything I write regarding the Qabalistic 
         Proof thereof, can only show that I Understand the formula of the Grade, 
         and Understanding is referred to 8=3, and appertains to the Grade of Master 
         of the Temple, which Office is admitted unto me by _ÿHION 9=2. Also, I 
         understand that it may be that One may in a way Attain unofficially without 
         of necessity holding office in any particular Grade. I make no claim to 
         9=2 for OPHION claims that and I have no wish to dispute his right to 
         it, anymore than he apparently wishes to dispute my right to 8=3, but 
         with 10=1 it is different. There is NO-One living in the flesh, as far 
         as I know, Who claims the Grade, and Whosoever does so it is a matter 
         which concerneth God alone.</p>
       <p>It has been written, by the highest living authority I know of, that 
         the Key of the Mystery of this Grade is that therein Selflessness is Self, 
         and what little I am able to comprehend of this, the Final Mystery, I 
         shall here record, for it may be that this writing shall be of help and 
         guidance to Whosoever shall next enter into that Great Crown, whose lesser 
         self shall become completely at One with the Godhead.</p>
       <p>It would seem to me that no living being, clothed with the body of flesh, 
         could claim fully to have attained that Grade, other than in the words 
         of Jesus the Christ "I and my Father are One," for, in the words 
         of Lao Tze The Name that can be named is not the True Name, and of Ko, 
         "I do not know its Name, but I make an effort and call it the Tao."</p>
       <p>Also Ko says, of the Possessor of the Tao, "Although he is styled 
         the possessor of the Tao, in reality he does not think that he has become 
         possessed of anything. It is as accomplished the transformation of all 
         living things, that he is styled the Possessor of the Tao." "He 
         who is able to understand this may transmit to others the Sacred Tao." 
         Who shall claim that he is able to accomplish the transformation of all 
         living things? Except it be understood that all things exist only by virtue 
         of their being in the mind of the Seer, and if the complete transformation 
         of the mind be accomplished, so that the Mystery of the Path of the Godhead 
         is seen therein, and becometh plain, even unto his Understanding, who 
         shall say that he has not accomplished this?</p>
       <p>First, then, regarding the experience of that Being we call O.I.V.V.I.O. 
         There arose is his consciousness, a state unlike the normal and which, 
         be description might appear very like madness (Path of Aleph IS Madness), 
         since Reason was destroyed and transcended. The Air became His Balance. 
         The structure of his mind, which hitherto had been built up on Qabalistic 
         lines, was changed and the House of God, was, as it were, destroyed by 
         the Lightning Flash. (opening of the Eye of Shiva.)</p>
       <p>At this time he walked, talked, and performed all physical actions in 
         a normal way, but all that took place, wherever he went, whatever he said 
         or heard, tasted or smelt had value according to his mental state. That 
         is to say, he perceived the actions of all around him in a different light 
         from usual, so that although peoÿle may have been acting quite normally, 
         and although he may have appeared to them as a normal being, or nearly 
         so, Life in all forms became a Great Drama of Initiation, and as he continued 
         to work out the great Qabalistic problems of the Universe, he found all 
         that he saw or did, woven into that Picture in his Mind. Then came a time 
         when everything had to be balanced and equilibrated, for it is written 
         "Equilibrium is the Basis of the Work" and he found that although 
         at that time all around (within) him was a Chaos, yet certain formulas 
         of Power were His so that gradually, and with great toil he accomplished 
         this, establishing the Elements and the Planets in their proper places 
         (Upon New Aeon Lines) and finally Uniting Aleph with Shin, so that all 
         disappeared. Then, it seemed, he was insructed in the Building of a New 
         Universe and this was not a simple scheme, but took place at two or more 
         different points (in space) at once so that he, as it were, added a square 
         there and a sphere here. It was as if the beginning of a Temple was builded 
         (four- square) and at the same time certain Mysteries of Babalon were 
         present to his consciousness, also in another place Was the Kether of 
         a New Tree formulated and then the Supernal Triad, with a Sphere Pendant 
         , which afterwards became Complete in Itself and comprehended All in One. 
         Yet all this while was the Being of O.I.V.V.I.O. being rebuilded from 
         the Feet Up, so that His Feet were of burnished Brass etc. and his body 
         was Filled with Fire. And all these things were seperate, yet one, and 
         all this while the body of O.I.V.V.I.O. was seated on the Stele of Revealing 
         in the Smoke Room of an ordinary steamer plying between Vancouver and 
         Victoria, yet such had been his experiences, that he could no longer tell 
         if it were above or below water, whether those around him were the living 
         or of the dead. And again, there was, as it were, a Great reflection of 
         the Stele in the Sky and this again was produced from a small Stele under 
         Ice (as it were in locked glass) below him. And yet, in all this The Air 
         was His Balance, and he went on calmly working out the details of the 
         reformula- tion of all things on the New Lines of this Aeon, copying the 
         Stele, and forming it first of one element, and then of another, and bringing 
         all to a fluid, then to a gas, and finally to fire and Aethyr as before 
         said. And when all had become a concentric System, this seemed to terminate 
         one part of the Initiation. (Note. I have enlarged this entry in copying 
         from diary.)</p>
       <p>We must now consider him as going about with his mind transformed into 
         a Solar Consciousness. This lasted all day during which he underwent many 
         adventures, and seemed to perform much Magick; but on that evening the 
         process continued, under extraordinary circumstances, to be recorded elsewhere, 
         but be it said that he was in a place which appeared to him like unto 
         a Temple of Initiation especially prepared in every detail for the Ceremony, 
         and around him were the Officers exactly carrying out their Appointed 
         parts. Yet was he unwittingly in prison surrounded by the scum of the 
         earth.</p>
       <p>Of which mystery He has written:</p>
       <p>When, having become free, thou findest thyself in prison, yet knowest 
         it not.<br>
         When, Thy prison of freedom appeareth unto thee as the open road. <br>
         When, thou who hast longed for the company of Saints findest thyself among 
         the scum of the earth, yet knowing it not thinkest thyself in the company 
         of all the Buddhas, and taketh thy place as the least of these in silence.<br>
         When, having sought and found gestures of Magick Power, thou findest thyself 
         among the lewd and unclean, yet knowing it not perceive in their common 
         actions the supreme and perfect Art of Magick.<br>
         When, having sought for Words of Power, thou findest thyself in tune with 
         the words of low men, knowing not that they speak ought but the Highest 
         Truth.<br>
         When, having given all, thou art offered the cup of charity, yet thinking 
         it to be the most abominable mixture of poison, thou drinkest it, thankfully.<br>
         When, having rushed forward, thou findest thyself whirled backwards, yet 
         knowing it not, thinkest thou art still.</p>
       <p>Then, it may be, thou hast comprehended wherein Sorrow is Joy, and Change 
         is Stability, and Selflessness is Self.</p>
       <p>But, to continue. During this final section the Solar Sphere of his Consciousness 
         became more and more concentrated until it appeared as a single point 
         of Light of intense brilliance, yet without him, now here, now there, 
         yet ever nearer and nearer to the Centre of the New Universe. The process 
         of exact balancing of all things (exterior things, not only things within 
         him) appeared to have got down to a very small radius. And those about 
         him, who appeared as the past Buddhas, helped in this final process. For 
         let us imagine that the Universal Centre was to be changed to that one 
         spot. That little room was the Centre of a New Universe and for thousands 
         of years had those Ancient Brethren toiled and striven to equilibrate 
         things perfectly in readiness for this moment. And now all was prepared, 
         and it needed only this One, Parzival, to complete Their number, and He 
         was Zero, and his Office was Silence, even as the God Harpocrates. The 
         slightest slip, and the Equilibrium would be upset and the Earth fall 
         into the Sun. Success, and the Earth itself became a Sun, by the fact 
         of a perfectly equilibrated Solar Consciousness having been established 
         there- in, at this new Centre. Those around him seemed to take up different 
         positions in the room so as to keep the balance by the weight of their 
         bodies, and finally O.I.V.V.I.O. was to take his seat in the exact Centre 
         of the Room, and then if all were well, Success. If not? Nearer and nearer 
         they came to the Centre. At last, O.I.V.V.I.O., His whole Being aflame 
         with the ecstacy of the God-head, yet calm and composed to outward appearance, 
         took his seat. And all was well.</p>
       <p>Next, it seemed even minute actions must be equilibrated. Those around, 
         who had each performed a certain task through-out the Centuries, performed 
         it for the last Time, perfectly. Frater O.I.V.V.I.O. sat Still, for His 
         Office was Silence and Stillness. Again, all was well. But speech remained. 
         Each had His own Word to utter perfectly and in proper Order, and in this 
         they tried over and over again. Gradually even this was perfected and 
         one by one they dropped out and remained in tense expectance of the End.</p>
       <p>And Frater O.I.V.V.I.O. remained there, still and silent, till at last 
         all seemed perfect even on the mental plane, for suddenly the English 
         language seemed to rush back to the beginning, and reversed as Hebrew 
         which is written the other way, and this was a great mystery. Then came 
         the equilibrating of ideas, and they rushed backwards and formulated them- 
         selves in the person of ADAM who appeared in the room opposite to O.I.V.V.I.O. 
         Then the first man, and the last gazed at each other, as it were, in a 
         final struggle. And the minute Point of Light grew ever brighter and more 
         dazzling, and appeared concentrated upon this figure of Adam, first on 
         the shoulder and then, moving a little, until finally settled in one eye. 
         At this point, Frater O.I.V.V.I.O. gazed, and then all rushed back again, 
         through the animal creation, each animal dissolving into its earlier type, 
         until at last, as the prototype, appeared the common fly, only very large, 
         perhaps six inches long. Then things stpped, for a moment, as Frater 
         O.I.V.V.I.O. gazed at this; then it became the Winged beetle, then the 
         scarabe, and Egyptian ideas crowded up. Then, Only the Point of Light. 
         Gradually he was able to bring this point nearer and nearer, until finally 
         it neared his breast. It touched his breast. It was in his breast, and 
         .....Suddenly A NEW CREATION. He had reached the BEGINNING and out of 
         the old elements he had witnesses on his return to the Source, was formed 
         a new design, the same material, but in a different Order. Wonder of Wonders. 
         Who shall express this Mystery in Words. And this happened again and again. 
         English, Hebrew, Greek, Egyptian, Man, beast and bird, were rearranged 
         and RE-Created in new relationship to each other. And so He understood 
         the Mystery of Change, and how the World is Created again and again, forever 
         new, yet forever the same. And the last Word he realized, which when repeated, 
         in a certain way, seemed to bring about these changes again and again, 
         as it were, alternating between Nothingness and Creation, was AL, and 
         there was a certain gesture, not unlike the sign of the Cross, which was 
         connected with this miracle.</p>
       <p>Now all this, and more, has remained sealed up in my mind so that I could 
         not express the smallest part of it in writing until now--though there 
         are those who I have told it to in part--and it was not until I began 
         to question of this Most Holy Word that all this became clear to me. Therefore, 
         let me now discourse for a moment, in the light of perspective, on this 
         Holy Name.</p>
       <p>There was no self THEN, and yet all was SELF when I Parzival pronounced 
         this Word and the Universe was destroyed, and reformed. And at that time 
         it did seem that He accomplished the transformation of all living things, 
         and as having done such He may be styled Possessor of the Tao, and now 
         he does not know that he has become possessed of anything. As it is written: 
         Of all this the Ipsissimus knoweth nothing.</p>
       <p>Immediately I cease telling of actual experience the Path becomes hard 
         again, but I will try.</p>
       <p>The Qabalists say that in the Beginning was NOT, and they called it Ain. 
         They also say the veils of the Negative depend back from Kether. Now LA 
         is NOT, and I think this Word in its True aspect is the Supreme Mystery 
         of the Godhead.</p>
       <p>NOT (LA) concentrated upon itself till it became a Point of Light and 
         flashed forth as AL-GOD, Kether then is the perfectly equilibrated juncture 
         of the Not and God, which in this Word are ONE. This caused the Lightning-flash 
         which formulated the Tree of Life, and the numeration of the Paths of 
         which is 777. And the numeration of this Word is 31 and it contains the 
         Mystery of the 3 in 1. (See Book 777 Col XXXVI Line 1, which confirms 
         this.)</p>
       <p>Now see Book 777 LXXXIV Lines 1,2,3, which attributes (although I knew 
         nothing of this at the time) to Briah the Creative World of the Divine 
         Name AL in the First Three Sephiroth. Now consider how 31 by 3 is 93. 
         The numeration of Thelema etc. also of 1=10 Grade, as before mentioned.</p>
       <p>Now it seems (and here I shall repeat parts of what I have previously 
         said in order to express the matter more fully) that Kether in Its aspect 
         as Not and God, is reflected into Chochmah, and this passes along the 
         Path of Aleph or Folly. And the Fool hath said in his heart There is NO-GOD 
         (LA-AL) so that the Magus becometh the Word, and as it were, the creator 
         of the Universe for in Him is Folly reflected as Wisdom.</p>
       <p>And Kether is reflected into Binah as LA, so that NEMO sitteth in Darkness 
         in the City of the Pyramids by the Great Sea. And this is transmitted 
         to Binah by the Path of the Great Magician--Beth--who is the Father of 
         Lies. Notice that the Flaming Sword does not touch that Path, for the 
         Wisdom of the Magus became at the lowest depth, the cunning of the Serpent, 
         and He crawled up the Tree again by the paths, and being Dual he created 
         opposite paths, thus producing Balance, and at the same time fixing the 
         Tree and Creation, therefore it is that the Light appears NOT to NEMO. 
         Whereas there is a real current from Kether to the Magus and from the 
         Magus to Nemo. And the Word reflecteth from Chochmah into Binah as AL, 
         which is partly false and partly True. Then the Light of the Supernal 
         reflecteth, or rather crosses the Abyss as a spark, into Chesed Jupiter, 
         the Father, and here again see 777 Col V Line 4 which attributes the God 
         name of this sphere in Assiah as AL. Therefore is it written that this 
         is the Sphere all manner of men call The First (See Konx OM Pax). Note 
         also that this Word is attributed to the Path of Mem, which is the Hanged 
         Man, or Redeemer, who shall re-establish the true order of things, and 
         in this symbol he is shown with his head downwards, or reversed. And Mem 
         = Water, suggests the Great Sea, and the reflection of the True Name therein.</p>
       <p>Note also how simple all this is, and how the highest Word is also one 
         of the most common, for it is tacked on to every Angel and Archangel, 
         to imply their connection with the true God. Also note St. John, how he 
         says "In the Beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and 
         the Word <em>was GOD</em>" (AL).</p>
       <p>Note also how the 31st Path is called Perpetual Intelligence and how 
         this Path has always been pointed to as having to do with the ultimate 
         mystery. It may be that the numeration was intended to point the way from 
         the beginning of the Journey.</p>
       <p>Another thing which strikes me, is that Aleph is the OX and the only 
         letter which seems to have a meaning definitely connected with it is Lamed 
         the OX-goad. Here again seems to be a hint of the secret to the discerning 
         one.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>September 25th 1918 E.V.</strong> Last night, 
         before sleeping, I discovered, or rather remembered for I had noticed 
         the fact in December last, that AL is the silent-sound of the indrawn 
         breath through the nose with mouth closed, and LA that of the outgoing 
         breath. This is a further proof of the Nature of the Holy Word which is 
         Before the spoken Word. Note the similarity with that of Neophyte. Also 
         it means this, that one cannot help repeating the Most Sacred Name of 
         God whenever one is Silent; so that every man and women has been doing 
         this from birth.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>September 26th 1918 E.V.</strong></p>
       <p>I have been making further considerations of this Holy Mystery of the 
         Silent Breath and it is very wonderful to think how whenever one breathes 
         silently, one is pronouncing that True and Ineffable Name. Every living 
         creature, is then by reason of their Nature worshipping the True God, 
         whatever their opinion may be. Also note that neither Wisdom nor Understanding 
         is essential to this. It IS and as long as we live we must perform this 
         operation at least during sleep. And it is written: "He giveth Himself 
         unto His Beloved in sleep."</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>Septemver 30th 1918 E.V.</strong></p>
       <p>I have to-day finished a design for a Symbol to express as well as I 
         can the results of my Initiation of Dec 21 1917 as explained in my further 
         Enlightenment of Sep 22 1918.</p>
       <p>It is intended to represent Kether with the Supernal Triad radiating 
         therefrom. This forms AL and LA, also A.A. and IAO and O.I.V. Also the 
         Centre of Circle is Hadith and the Circle Nuit. The Circle can be taken 
         to represent LA etc. The Angle is 120 degrees or One third of a Circle. 
         The Shape bounded at top by Circle and below by Our Lady Nuit for her 
         pantacle etc. Have ordered it to be made in White Gold on One inch base.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>Monday to Tuesday October 7th and 8th</strong></p>
       <p>Have been working on the theory that the Holy Word revealed to O.I.V.V.I.O. 
         in its inmost aspect is also the Key of the Mysteries of the Book of the 
         Law. Let us consider in what ways this may be so.</p>
       <p>My experience showed me that Hadith was Kether, and Nuit appears to be 
         very similar to The Veil of the Negative which the Qabalists speak of. 
         777 seems to confirm this, for Hadit is attributed to Line One and Nuit 
         to 0; also same idea is symbolized in that which was granted to me when 
         I made the Pantacle of Nuit.</p>
       <p>I think the idea we should try to formulate, is very much that of the 
         Qabalists, though the real meaning, is, I am convinced, a matter of experience. 
         First was Nothing, and this may be called LA while it is considered as 
         expanding into Limitless Space (Ain Soph) and becoming Limitless Light, 
         perhaps. The Beginning of things was caused by a simple change of conception, 
         as it were a "looking inwards" instead of outwards, and a corresponding 
         change from LA to AL. I think the difference in the way the English and 
         Hebrew Alphabets are written, is a good symbol of this, the direction 
         is different, so that the two letters might stand for either LA or AL 
         according to the manner in which we look upon them. The great value of 
         this Word lies in the fact that the self-same symbol contains the ideas 
         of Nothing and Something, without any change in itself, and this seems 
         to be the one Symbol that gets over the difficult transi- tion from NOT 
         to ONE. Of course it was not even a Word in the beginning, but the Silent 
         Breath, Expansion and Contraction, and the true theory of the Universe 
         is that it was created by the First Breath of the Tao, or Nuit. We find 
         this confirmed in Liber Legis Ch. 1 Verse 28. "None breathed the 
         light faint and faery of the stars and two."</p>
       <p>Here we have the idea of the first breath of Not (LA) the Limitless Light, 
         which concentrates upon Kether which is ONE or Hadith, or AL and gives 
         the first faint idea of duality which shows forth in the Word later-but 
         which being composed of the ideas Nothing and One is really One.</p>
       <p>Now Hadit is really unextended, and can only be imagined as the Minute 
         Point of Light at that Point where LA changes into AL, for he is the Secret 
         Centre. In order to get a somewhat clearer idea we must consider Nuit 
         as dual, viz: LALA, when AL shows up as that Centre. In this case it is 
         strange and worth noting that we have a word with the sound Laylah or 
         Night, and I don't think the spelling matters for see Ch. III, "spelling 
         is defunct." It is the sound that matters. I cannot help thinking 
         ALLA in the same way produced and was concealed in Allah. we are told 
         in Ch. I, V.9 to worship the Khabs (the house of Hadit) and behold my 
         (Nuit's) light shed over you, because Khabs is the Central Point of Light, 
         and we thus perform an act similar to that which made Creation manifest, 
         rather than Not.</p>
       <p>Ch. I v 21. With the God and the Adorer I am nothing, they do not see 
         me. They are upon the earth. I am Heaven and there is no other God than 
         me and my lord Hadit.</p>
       <p>Now if Hadit = AL = God, then with Him is Nuit (LA) nothing. Also this 
         is so with the Adorer unless he concentrates on Hadit as the Centre as 
         instructed. Yet is also true that "there is no other God than me 
         and my lord Hadit" for looked at one way the God is Nuit and the 
         other Hadit.</p>
       <p>Ch. I. v 22. Clearly tells us that Nuit has a secret name. This I take 
         to be LA (or possibly LALA). Also it is written in this verse "Bind 
         nothing" and besides its obvious sense, this may be an expression 
         of the binding of Nothing by concentration on a point. This Word binds 
         nothing, as it causes the transition from Nothing to God.</p>
       <p>Ch. I v 29.30 It will be seen that there really is no division.</p>
       <p>Ch. I v 35. Note "threefold" Book of Law. [A]</p>
       <p>Ch. I v. 40. Note "Three grades." (Since making this note, 
         I have had an opportunity of looking at the Equinox for a moment, and 
         discovered that in Vol. 7, Comment. The Tarot Keys of the three Grades 
         add to 31, which I consider a further proof. I may remark that I have 
         been placed where I have no books but the V.S.L. for reference, and am 
         therefore writing all these notes entirely from memory of my experience, 
         which seems to make certain things clearer from day to day, as I apply 
         my attention to different aspects of the work.)</p>
       <p>Ch. I, v 45. The Perfect and the Perfect are one Perfect and not two, 
         nay are none.</p>
       <p>Here I think Nuit and Hadit are referred to as the Perfect, for this 
         is claimed by Hadit, see Ch II, v 15. If Nuit be considered as LA and 
         Hadit as AL, this is at once clear for they are One and yet None.</p>
       <p>Ch. I, v 46. Nothing is a secret key of this Law, sixty one the Jews 
         call it. I call it eight, eighty, fourhundred and eighteen.</p>
       <p>(I made a partial explanation of this in diary, but since I got a clearer 
         and fuller one on Oct 21, I insert same here in its proper place.)</p>
       <p>To-day I have made another attempt at the Qabalistic explanation of the 
         verse. It is getting clearer. At the time of Initiation, it will be remembered 
         O.I.V.V.I.O. identifies himself entirely with Parzival through- out. [B] 
         For he says he found the Word, and the Word was Parzival. (There is of 
         course a very definite connection between Parzival and Abrahadabra, the 
         Word of the Aeon, through 418. And it is said that Abrahadabra shall be 
         His child and that strangely) And Parzival having Eight letters, and Initial 
         value 80 and total numeration of 418 is therefore connected with this 
         verse. It was through this Name that he came upon the Mystery of AL and 
         LA which is finally summed up in A, (as will be shown later.)</p>
       <p>Let us take this verse again;</p>
       <p>Nothing (LA) is a secret key of this <em>Law</em>. 61 (Ain) the Jews 
         <em>called</em> it, I call it 80.80.418 (Parzival, The Fool, Aleph, One). 
         Therefore 61 plus 1 = 62.</p>
       <p>But they have (also) the half 31 = AL (and they have Not (LA) the other 
         half) and twice 31 is 62.</p>
       <p>Therefore ALLA = 62 which is 6 plus 2 = 8 = Cheth = 418 = Parzival = 
         Fool = Aleph = One (or None) and thus all disappears in One. Also since 
         ALLA becomes A, <em>ALL</em> has disappeared.</p>
       <p>Again it is written The Fool hath said in his heart There is NO-GOD = 
         LA AL which again indicates the secret and I think LA AL in this form 
         is the secret name or word of Ra HOOR Khuit. See Ch. III, v 49. I am a 
         secret fourfold word, the blasphemy against all the gods of men. Also, 
         whereas Nuit and Hadit are ever united the division becomes manifest in 
         R.H.K. For he says in Ch. III, v 2. There is division hither homeward, 
         there is a word not known. (Can there be any connection here with "She 
         shall be known and I never?) Spelling is defunct, all is not aught. Not: 
         AUGHT, may indicate the nature of the All LA, Not AL aught.</p>
       <p>Verse 48. Note the OX or Aleph and the Fool or O, seems to indicate the 
         explanation given above, also points to the idea that the key is something 
         which itself combines these ideas.</p>
       <p>Ch. I, v 51. Mentions the 4 Gates, and this is the mystery of the path 
         of Aleph again, and the fourfold name R.H.K. One can enter these in turn 
         or at once, if he understands the trick of combinations.</p>
       <p>Ch. I. v 52. "If this be not aright, if ye confound the space marks 
         saying: They are one, or saying, They are many" etc.</p>
       <p>There should be no space-marks, except on the plane of reason. When the 
         experience of this mystery is granted, it will be seen how there are none, 
         for the whole thing is a continuous process, even as Nuit is continuous.</p>
       <p>Ch. I, v 55. He has beheld some of them I think, as is proved by this 
         writing.</p>
       <p>Ch. I, v 56. Indicates that there are two halves of the equation, even 
         as there are two aspects of this Word.</p>
       <p>Ch. I, v 57. ?House of God = Beth-EL = Path of Beth?</p>
       <p>Ch. II, v 2. "I, Hadit am the complement of Nuit my bride". 
         This indicates they are really One or None, and I think the Word clears 
         this up.</p>
       <p>Verse 7. "Come unto me" is a foolish word; for it is I that 
         go". "Come unto me" is the call of Nuit. When Hadit (AL) 
         considers Nuit (LA) or "lifts up his head" He becomes Not therefore 
         He goes.</p>
       <p>Ch II, v 14. "Now let there be a veiling of this shrine; now let 
         the light devour men and eat them up with blindness"</p>
       <p>Verse 15. "For I am perfect being Not and my number is nine by the 
         fools, but with the just I am eight and one in eight which is vital, for 
         I am none indeed."</p>
       <p>Hadit here clearly says he is Not, or BEING-NOT (a combination of Nuit 
         and Hadit as the Perfect and Perfect, which, be it remembered are One, 
         nay None.) We have considered His particular aspect as AL rather than 
         LA, but the previous verse indicates a blind. He is the shrine veiled 
         by Not, for AL is the manifestation of LA, and LA is the hiding of AL 
         (See first verse of Chapters I and II). He is Eight with the just because 
         they consider the balance of things and so consider him as AL-LA which 
         again gives 62 = 8 = Cheth = 418 = Fool = Aleph = None as explained before 
         in answer to the riddle of Nuit. This shows he is One (Aleph) in eight, 
         and also None, quite clearly.</p>
       <p>Now comes the striking indication of an underlying formula in this Book, 
         which can be read in two ways, and the very same Word is used to express 
         this, only in the English instead of the Hebrew, which of course throws 
         one off the scent of the mystery.</p>
       <p>Ch. II, v 19. "Is a God to live in a dog? No. But the highest are 
         of us."</p>
       <p>Now in English, God is Dog if reversed, but the Hebrew for God is AL 
         which reversed gives LA which is Not. One can hardly get away from the 
         hint of the true nature of the Key, once it is pointed out, especially 
         since it is followed by the negative No. (another translation of LA) and 
         a statement that the highest or those who comprehend this mystery. "are 
         of us".</p>
       <p>Ch. II, v 23. I am alone; there is no God where I am.</p>
       <p>I am AL-ONE, there is LA-AL where I am, viz: He is both one with Nuit 
         and Ra-Hoor-Khuit.</p>
       <p>Ch. II, v 26. I am the secret serpent (Wisdom of the Word) coiled about 
         to spring. If I lift up my head I and my Nuit are one. If I droop down 
         my head and shoot forth venom, there is rapture of the earth, and I and 
         the earth are one.</p>
       <p>Gives another proof of the peculiar dual aspect of the Word. It will 
         be noticed that Nuit has said that the God and the Adorer are upon the 
         Earth. As God, Hadit is one with the Earth, as NOT, he is one with Nuit. 
         Also Hadit is called Her secret centre and the world, her heart and her 
         tongue, the House or Home of Hadit, makes the spoken Word possible.</p>
       <p>Verse 27. There is great danger in reasoning over this Mystery, it must 
         be realized.</p>
       <p>Verse 32. All their words are skew-wise, viz: they do not partake of 
         the true peculiar nature of the True Word which is equally balanced and 
         can be read either backwards or forwards.</p>
       <p>Verse 33. "Damned for a dog", the reverse of God in its wrong 
         aspect.</p>
       <p>Verse 76. I don't make this out yet, but it seems to indicate that it 
         will not come till later, after the Prophet's time. Anyway AL appears 
         twice among the letters.</p>
       <p>Ch. III, v 2. This was commented upon before. This whole chapter appears 
         to me to be quite a different character to the former ones. R-H-K is the 
         Word as the offspring of Hadit and Nuit.</p>
       <p>Verse 35. The half of the word of Heru-ra-ha probably indicates some 
         mystery in this division as indicated in Verse 2. I think thus far he 
         has been LA, for in Verse 35 we have him worshipped as AL or God. (Unity- 
         uttermost-might of breath)</p>
       <p>Verse 47. Note according to this theory the importance of the letters 
         and their positions to one another. Also the statement that one shall 
         discover the key of it all. (By the way, V. 39 makes a statement "In 
         it is the word secret and not only in the English". I think this 
         may mean that the Word AL does not appear at all, and NOT only appears 
         in the English instead of Hebrew) [C]</p>
       <p>I think Verse 48 terminates the AL section, and Verse 49 mentions the 
         Fourfold word, which I have taken to be LA AL.</p>
       <p>Verse 71 may indicate AL as Chochmah and LA as Binah and the solution 
         of the Mystery in Kether Hadit.</p>
       <p>Verse 74 may indicate that the splendour in His name hidden and glorious 
         is the two centre letters A.A. The Silver Star. Note, according to Blavatsky 
         AL is the Sun or Phallus.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>Friday, 11th October 1918 E.V.</strong> I spent 
         last evening with Therion; during our conversation, he said that he thought 
         Nuit and Hadit were best expressed as Matter and Motion. He also said 
         that all things must be considered as Zero or Two, as if One were arrived 
         at "there was no getting away from it." I pointed out that there 
         must be some formula combining Zero and One, or the Tree of Life could 
         never have been conceived of and formulated. He admitted this but said 
         that so far he had failed to find such.</p>
       <p>When I got to bed, I could not sleep, and a number of other things connected 
         with this mystery came to me.</p>
       <p>One was, the significant fact that when A.C. first got into touch with 
         the Brothers of A.A. (See Vision and Voice, I have not any books here, 
         so cannot quote), the Pass word was "There is No-God." This 
         seems to confirm this Word, as the central secret of A.ù.A.ù. Who also 
         gave out the New Law.</p>
       <p>I also notice that NU reversed is UN or One. Likewise with the addition 
         of IT Nuit is Unit.</p>
       <p>Then I remembered that in Equinox V (I think) AL is clearly defined as 
         the Ox and the Goad, also as MATTER and MOTION, and I cannot see how A.C. 
         could have missed this connection with Nuit and Hadit, since it is undoubtedly 
         the true formula of his present conception of Their nature.</p>
       <p>Then I noticed another very important thing. I was wondering why A and 
         L should be chosen, or rather why L, the 12th letter of the Hebrew alphabet 
         should follow A, the first. But this is not actually the case for AL is 
         the first sound in the pronunciation of Aleph the First letter of the 
         Hebrew alphabet (as it is also of Alpha) and the addition of Pe shows 
         the mouth as necessary to the spoken word, though in Kether, it was but 
         a silent breath through the nose. (Notice Kether is called "Long 
         of nose", also the Image is on a Face seen in profile, viz: only 
         one aspect of the word can be comsidered at a time in the reasoning mind). 
         It is strange also how L is pronounced LA-med, this showing the duality 
         as soon as it is taken into consideration as a seperate letter.</p>
       <p>Thus is AL, in very truth the first possible sound, and notice that when 
         one pronounces it aloud, the tongue is raised and placed against the teeth, 
         but as soon as it is released, LA is automatically pronounced by a slightly 
         indrawn breath. In the Silent breath of the Beginning this is reversed, 
         AL is the underlying sound of the indrawn breath and LA that of the outgoing.</p>
       <p>Now notice how Hadit is spoken of as the tongue of Nuit and how when 
         His head is raised etc. and lowered etc.</p>
       <p>Note also how in pronouncing the first letter Aleph, one's tongue must 
         meet the teeth, and the tooth is Shin, the 31st path; also see how these 
         paths were welded in the Initiation of O.I.V.V.I.O.</p>
       <p>Note. LA LA may stand for NOT NOT, or "something"; it also 
         suggests 0 = 0 or 0 to the o degree.</p>
       <p>ALLA suggests 1 to the o degree</p>
       <p>LAAL suggests 0 to the 1st degree</p>
       <p>Nothing under its three forms.</p>
       <p>I also found, which seems to be of the greatest importance that the essence 
         of Thelema is summed up in this Word. A is the pentagram, the Star of 
         Will and L is Libra, Justice or the Law, while 31 backwards is 13 which 
         is Love and Unity. [D]</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>October 16th</strong> Another discovery. During 
         the Initiation of Dec. 1917 the mind of O.I.V.V.I.O. must have actually 
         reversed and run backwards (See Liber Thisharb) so that on reaching the 
         beginning of the ideas underlying the Hebrew Alphabet he naturally arrived 
         at the first letter ALP in its reverse order. He came therefore to P which 
         accounts for the Flash (destroying the House of God or Beth EL) then in 
         due sequence to LA or nothing. This again reversed, as stated, and he 
         got AL followed by another flash P. Observe how all this is summed up 
         in the One letter ALP which is One and None.</p>
       <p>Further, the process as described, produces the two A's thus indicating 
         the inmost meaning of A.A.</p>
       <p>But now if we begin to take into consideration 2 letters, we find in 
         the return process BA = To come or Go, which again reverses as AB, The 
         Father. Analysing the complete process we get Th.I.P.B.L.A.A.L.B.I.Th.</p>
       <p align="center">Th = The Tau Cross mentioned by O.I.V.V.I.O. as the sign 
         accompanying the process. Also, The Universe.<br>
         I = The creative essence (also hand which makes sign) and this is the 
         Spark of Light, first seen outside.<br>
         B = The Magician who makes the sign; also the House of God, the Body.<br>
         P = The Flash referred to, and the destruction of all resulting in<br>
         L = balance, then<br>
         A = Equilibrium, the Point perfectly centered in breast. (Hadit compre- 
         hended for a moment.)<br>
         AL = God<br>
         P = Another Flash (Flaming Sword).<br>
         B = Comprehension of this dual process in One and Nothing and understand- 
         ing of Beth El as true House of God.<br>
         I = Creative essence of the Word.<br>
         Th = Producing a New Universe. (Notice how all this is borne out in the 
         actual experience of O.I.V.V.I.O. as recorded.)<br>
         <strong>October 19</strong></p>
       <p>Another discovery re PARZIVAL, (as already mentioned) that this Word 
         reversed was what led me to the discovery of the Mystery of AL and finally 
         to that of Aleph in which all is summed up.</p>
       <p>I also noticed to-day that the Three Grades of the Order may be summed 
         up in the Letter Beth. For Beth is the Magician or the Lover, Yod is the 
         Hermit and Th the Universe or Man of Earth.</p>
       <p>Again AL suggests, by shape, the Square and Compass very accurately, 
         as used by Masons to Symbolise God.</p>
       <p>Now I feel that there is no more to be said on this matter at this time, 
         therefore I may return to the Contemplation of this Mystery in Silence.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>STATEMENT OF THE AUTHOR</strong><br>
         <strong>March 13, 1948</strong></p>
       <p>I, CHARLES STANSFIELD JONES, (Frater Achad, etc.) of "Tall Timbers", 
         Deep Cove, British Columbia, Canada, being the author of the accompanying 
         manuscript entitled "Liber Thirty-One" (a part of my private 
         magical diary, originally transcribed and typed with one carbon copy in 
         November 1918, the single copy having been delivered to Aleister Crowley 
         by mail early in September 1919 and since lost or destroyed) do now make 
         the following statement:</p>
       <p>On March 4, 1948, I received from Gerald J. Yorke, Esq., of 5, Montaque 
         Square, London, W.1., England, a letter which contained the following:</p>
       <p>"As you probably know A.C. had died. I am sorting his papers prior 
         to their dispatch to America. Your Liber 31 has not survived amongst these 
         papers, though there is a reference to it on page 127 of The Equinox of 
         the Gods. Would you care to send me a coÿy, which on my death will go 
         to the British Museum with my other Crowleyana. I think it important that 
         one copy of your treatise 31 should exist in this country, as if it does 
         so exist it will be available for anyone sufficiently interested in Liber 
         Al to wish to see it."</p>
       <p>In response to this request, and for the purpose stated by Mr. Yorke, 
         I have had prepared from the single original manuscript in my possession 
         one further typescript and four carbon copies. The typescript which accompan- 
         ies this statement has been personally checked by me and is a true copy 
         (only one extra note having been added on the first page in reference 
         to original date of delivery of ms.) Of the four extra carbon copies it 
         is my intention to deliver one to Miss Grace R. Hallam of Vancouver, British 
         Columbia, Canada and one to Dr. J.P. Kowal of 5821 Chene Street, Detroit 
         11, Michigan, U.S.A. so that there may be a record in these countries 
         as well as in England. One of the remaining two copies will be attached 
         to the original manuscript in my files, and the other kept in case of 
         later publication or other need. Further copies are not be be made without 
         my written permission.</p>
       <p align="center"><strong>FOOTNOTES</strong></p>

       <p>Oct 31st 1918 E.V. Just before sleeping I had an impression that if I 
         added up the total letters in my Mottoes they would = 31. I did so mentally 
         and found UNUS IN OMNIBUS (= 13 = Achad) OMNIA IN UNO (= 10.ù.1 = 10) 
         PARZIVAL = 8. 13 = 10 = 8 = 31.</p>
       <p>This is extraordinary becuase it was a kind of revelation.</p>
       <p>[C]</p>
       <p>I think this is one of the reasons why the Original in the writing of 
         the Beast must always be included with any translation into other tongues. 
         For there are mysteries in the <em>English</em> that would not work out 
         if translated.</p>
