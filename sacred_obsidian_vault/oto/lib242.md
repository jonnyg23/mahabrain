 <h1>Aha!</h1>
 <p>The Sevenfold Mystery of the Ineffable Love; the Coming of the Lord in the 
   Air as King and Judge of this corrupted World;</p>
 <p>Wherein</p>
 <p>Under the form of a Discourse between Marsyas an Adept and Olympas his Pupil 
   the Whole Secret of the Way of Initiation is laid open from the Beginning to 
   the End; for the Instruction of the Little Children of the Light. </p>
 <p>Written in Trembling and Humility for the Brethren of the A.'. A.'. by Their 
   very dutiful Servant, an Aspirant to their Sublime Order,</p>
 <p>Aleister Crowley</p>
 <h2>THE ARGUMENTATION</h2>
 <p>A LITTLE before Dawn, the pupil comes to greet his Master, and begs instruction. 
 </p>
 <p>Inspired by his Angel, he demands the Doctrine of being rapt away into the 
   Knowledge and Conversation of Him. </p>
 <p>The Master discloses the doctrine of Passive Attention or Waiting. </p>
 <p>This seeming hard to the Pupil, it is explained further, and the Method of 
   Resignation, Constancy, and Patience inculcated. The Paradox of Equilibrium. 
   The necessity of giving oneself wholly up the the new element. Egoism rebuked.</p>
 <p>The Master, to illustrate this Destruction of the Ego, describes the Visions 
   of Dhyana. </p>
 <p>He further describes the defence of the Soul against assailing Thoughts, and 
   shows that the duality of Consciousness is a blasphemy against the Unity of 
   God; so that even the thought called God is a denial of God-as-He-is-in-Himself. 
 </p>
 <p>The pupil sees nothing but a blank midnight in this Emptying of the Soul. He 
   is shown that this is the necessary condition of Illumination. Distinction is 
   further made between these three Dhyanas, and those early visions in which things 
   appear as objective. With these three Dhyanas, moreover, are Four other of the 
   Four Elements: and many more. </p>
 <p>Above these is the Veil of Paroketh. Its guardians. </p>
 <p>The Rosy Cross lies beyond this veil, and therewith the vision called Vishvarupadarshana. 
   Moreover, there is the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel. 
 </p>
 <p>The infinite number and variety of these Visions. </p>
 <p>The impossibility of revealing all these truths to the outer and uninitiated 
   world. </p>
 <p>The Vision of the Universal Peacock--Atmadarshana. The confusion of the Mind, 
   and the Perception of its self-contradiction. </p>
 <p>The Second Veil--the Veil of the Abyss. </p>
 <p>The fatuity of Speech. </p>
 <p>A discussion as to the means by which the vision arises in the pure Soul is 
   useless; suffice it that in the impure Soul no Vision will arise. The practical 
   course is therefore to cleanse the Soul. </p>
 <p>The four powers of the Sphinx; even adepts hardly attain to one of them!</p>
 <p>The final Destruction of the Ego. </p>
 <p>The Master confesses that he has lured the disciple by the promise of Joy, 
   as the only thing comprehensible by him, although pain and joy are transcended 
   even in early visions. </p>
 <p>Ananda (bliss)--and its opposite--mark the first steps of the path. Ultimately 
   all things are transcended; and even so, this attainment of Peace is but as 
   a scaffolding to the Palace of the King. </p>
 <p>The sheaths of the soul. The abandonment of all is necessary; the adept recalls 
   his own tortures, as all that he loved was torn away. </p>
 <p>The Ordeal of the Veil of the Abyss; the Unbinding of the Fabric of Mind, and 
   its ruin. </p>
 <p>The distinction between philosoÿhical credence and interior certitude. </p>
 <p>Sammasati--the trance wherein the adept perceives his causal connection with 
   the Universe; past, present, and future. </p>
 <p>Mastering the Reason, he becomes as a little child, and invokes his Holy Guardian 
   Angel, the Augoeides. </p>
 <p>Atmadarshana arising is destroyed by the Opening of the Eye of Shiva; the annihilation 
   of the Universe. The adept is destroyed, and there arises the Master of the 
   Temple. </p>
 <p>The pupil, struck with awe, proclaims his devotion to the Master; whereat the 
   latter bids him rather unite himself with the Augoeides. </p>
 <p>Yet, following the great annihilation, the adept reappears as an Angel to instruct 
   men in this doctrine. </p>
 <p>The Majesty of the Master described. </p>
 <p>The pupil, wonder-struck, swears to attain, and asks for further instruction.</p>
 <p>The Master describes the Eight Limbs of Yoga. </p>
 <p>The pupil lamenting the difficulty of attainment, the Master shows forth the 
   sweetness of the hermit's life. </p>
 <p>One doubt remains: will not the world be able instantly to recognise the Saint? 
   The Master replies that only imperfect Saints reveal themselves as such. Of 
   these are the cranks and charlatans, and those that fear and deny Life. But 
   let us fix our thoughts on Love, and not on the failings of others!</p>
 <p>The Master invokes the Augoeides; the pupil through sympathy is almost rapt 
   away. </p>
 <p>The Augoeides hath given the Master a message; namely, to manifest the New 
   Way of the Equinox of Horus, as revealed in Liber Legis. </p>
 <p>He does so, and reconciles it with the Old Way by inviting the Test of Experiment. 
   They would go therefore to the Desert or the Mountains--nay! here and now shall 
   it be accomplished. </p>
 <p>Peace to all beings!</p>
