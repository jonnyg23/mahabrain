 <blockquote> <font size="+1">0.</font> O my God! One is Thy Beginning! One is 
   Thy Spirit, and Thy Permutation One!<br>
   <font size="+1">1.</font> Let me extol Thy perfections before men.<br>
   <font size="+1">2.</font> In the Image of a Sixfold Star that flameth across 
   the Vault inane, let me re-veil Thy perfections.<br>
   <font size="+1">3.</font> Thou hast appeared unto me as an aged God, a venerable 
   God, the Lord of Time, bearing a sharp sickle.<br>
   <font size="+1">4.</font> Thou hast appeared unto me as a jocund and ruddy God,full 
   of Majesty, a King, a Father in his prime. Thou didst bear the sceptre of the 
   Universe, crowned with the Wheel of the Spirit.<br>
   <font size="+1">5.</font> Thou hast appeared unto me with sword and spear, a 
   warrior God in flaming armour among Thine horsemen.<br>
   <font size="+1">6.</font> Thou hast appeared unto me as a young and brilliant 
   God, a god of music and beauty, even as a young god in his strength, playing 
   upon the lyre.<br>
   <font size="+1">7.</font> Thou hast appeared unto me as the white foam of Ocean 
   gathered into limbs whiter than the foam, the limbs of a miracle of women, as 
   a goddess of extreme love, bearing the girdle of gold.<br>
   <font size="+1">8.</font> Thou hast appeared to me as a young boy mischievous 
   and lovely, with Thy winged globe and its serpents set upon a staff.<br>
   <font size="+1">9.</font> Thou hast appeared to me as an huntress among Thy 
   dogs, as a goddess virginal chaste, as a moon among the faded oaks of the wood 
   of years.<br>
   <font size="+1">10.</font> But I was deceived by none of these. All these I 
   cast aside, crying: Begone! So that all these faded from my vision.<br>
   <font size="+1">11.</font> Also I welded together the Flaming Star and the Sixfold 
   Star in the forge of my soul, and behold! a new star 418 that is above all these.<br>
   <font size="+1">12.</font> Yet even so was I not deceived; for the crown hath 
   twelve rays.<br>
   <font size="+1">13.</font> And these twelve rays are one.</blockquote>

 <blockquote><font size="+1">0.</font> Now then I saw these things averse and evil; 
   and they were not, even as Thou art Not.<br>
   <font size="+1">1.</font> I saw the twin heads that ever battle against one 
   another, so that all their thought is a confusion. I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">2.</font> I saw the darkeners of wisdom, like black apes chattering 
   vile nonsense. I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">3.</font> I saw the devouring mothers of Hell, that eat up their 
   children - O ye that are without understanding! I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">4.</font> I saw the merciless and the unmajestic like harpies 
   tearing their foul food. I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">5.</font> I saw the burning ones, giants like volcanoes belching 
   out the black vomit of fire and smoke in their fury. I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">6.</font> I saw the petty, the quarrelsome, the selfish, - they 
   were like men, O Lord, they were even like unto men. I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">7.</font> I saw the ravens of death, that flew with hoarse cries 
   upon the carrion earth. I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">8.</font> I saw the lying spirits like frogs upon the earth, 
   and upon the water, and upon the treacherous metal that corrodeth all things 
   and abideth not. I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">9.</font> I saw the obscene ones, bull-men linked in the abyss 
   of putrefaction, that gnawed each other's tongues for pain. I saw Thee in these.<br>
   <font size="+1">10.</font> I saw the Woman. O my God, I beheld the image thereof, 
   even as a lovely shape that concealeth a black monkey, even as a figure that 
   draweth with her hands small images of men down into hell. I saw her from the 
   head to the navel a woman, from the navel to the feet of her a man. I saw Thee 
   even in her.<br>
   <font size="+1">11.</font> For mine was the keyword to the Closed Palace 418 
   and mine the reins of the Chariot of the Sphinxes, black and white.<br>
   But I was not deceived by anything of all these things.<br>
   <font size="+1">12.</font> For I expanded it by my subtlety into Twelve Rays 
   of the Crown.<br>
   <font size="+1">13.</font> And these twelve rays were One.</blockquote>

 <blockquote><font size="+1">0.</font> Say thou that He God is one; God is the 
   Everlasting One; nor hath He any Equal, or any Son, or any Companion. Nothing 
   shall stand before His face.<br>
   <font size="+1">1.</font> Even for five hundred and eleven times nightly for 
   one and forty days did I cry aloud unto the Lord the affirmation of His Unity.<br>
   <font size="+1">2.</font> Also did I glorify His wisdom, whereby He made the 
   worlds.<br>
   <font size="+1">3.</font> Yea, I praised Him for His intelligible essence, whereby 
   the universe became light.<br>
   <font size="+1">4.</font> I did thank Him for His manifold mercy; I did worship 
   His magnificence and majesty.<br>
   <font size="+1">5.</font> I trembled before His might.<br>
   <font size="+1">6.</font> I delighted in the Harmony and Beauty of His Essence.<br>
   <font size="+1">7.</font> In His Victory I pursued His enemies; yea I drave 
   them down the steep; I thundered after them into the utmost abyss; yea, therein 
   I partook of the glory of my Lord.<br>
   <font size="+1">8.</font> His Splendour shone upon me; I adored His adorable 
   splendour.<br>
   <font size="+1">9.</font> I rested myself, admiring the Stability of Him, how 
   the shaking of His Universe, the dissolution of all things, should move Him 
   not.<br>
   <font size="+1">10.</font> Yea, verily, I the Lord Viceregent of His Kingdom, 
   I, Adonai, who speak unto my servant V.V.V.V.V. did rule and govern in His place.<br>
   <font size="+1">11.</font> Yet also did I formulate the word of double power 
   in the Voice of the Master, even the word 418.<br>
   <font size="+1">12.</font> And all these things deceived me not, for I expanded 
   them by my subtlety into the Twelve Rays of the Crown.<br>
   <font size="+1">13.</font> And these twelve rays were One.</blockquote>

 <blockquote><font size="+1">0.</font> Also the little child, the lover of Adonai, 
   even V.V.V.V.V., reflecting the glory of Adonai, lifted up his voice and said:<br>
   <font size="+1">1.</font> Glory to God, and Thanksgiving to God! There is One 
   God alone, and God is exceeding great. He is about us, and there is no strength 
   save in Him the exalted, the great.<br>
   <font size="+1">2.</font> Thus did V.V.V.V.V. become mad, and wend about naked.<br>
   <font size="+1">3.</font> And all these things fled away, for he understood 
   them all, that they were but as old rags upon the Divine Perfection.<br>
   <font size="+1">4.</font> Also he pitied them all, that they were but reflections 
   distorted.<br>
   <font size="+1">5.</font> Also he smote them, lest they should bear rule over 
   the just.<br>
   <font size="+1">6.</font> Also he harmonized them into one picture, beautiful 
   to behold.<br>
   <font size="+1">7.</font> And having thus conquered them, there was a certain 
   glamour of holiness even in the hollow sphere of outward brilliance.<br>
   <font size="+1">8.</font> So that all became splendid.<br>
   <font size="+1">9.</font> And having firmly stablished them in order and disposition,<br>
   <font size="+1">10.</font> He proclaimed the perfection, the bride, the delight 
   of God in His creation.<br>
   <font size="+1">11.</font> But though thus he worked, he tried ever his work 
   by the Star 418.<br>
   <font size="+1">12.</font> And it deceived him not; for by his subtlety he expanded 
   it all into the Twelve Rays of the Crown.<br>
   <font size="+1">13.</font> And these twelve rays were One.</blockquote>

 <blockquote><font size="+1">0.</font> In the place of the cross the indivisible 
   point which hath no points nor parts nor magnitude. Nor indeed hath it position, 
   being beyond space. Nor hath it existence in time, for it is beyond Time. Nor 
   hath it cause or effect, seeing that its Universe is infinite every way, and 
   partaketh not of these our conceptions.<br>
   <font size="+1">1.</font> So wrote <img src="images/oumh.gif" align="TOP" width="70" height="24"> 
   the Exempt Adept, and the laughter of the Masters of the Temple abashed him 
   not.<br>
   <font size="+1">2.</font> Nor was he ashamed, hearing the laughter of the little 
   dogs of hell.<br>
   <font size="+1">3.</font> For he abode in his place, and his falsehood was truth 
   in his place.<br>
   <font size="+1">4.</font> The little dogs cannot correct him, for they can do 
   naught but bark.<br>
   <font size="+1">5.</font> The masters cannot correct him, for they say: Come 
   and see.<br>
   <font size="+1">6.</font> And I came and saw, even I, Perdurabo, the Philosophus 
   of the Outer College.<br>
   <font size="+1">7.</font> Yea, even I the man beheld this wonder.<br>
   <font size="+1">8.</font> And I could not deliver it unto myself.<br>
   <font size="+1">9.</font> That which established me is invisible and unknowable 
   in its essence.<br>
   <font size="+1">10.</font> Only they who know IT may be known.<br>
   <font size="+1">11.</font> For they have the genius of the mighty sword 418.<br>
   <font size="+1">12.</font> And they are not deceived by any of these things; 
   for by their subtlety do they expand them all into the Twelve Rays of the Crown.<br>

   <font size="+1">10.</font> He hath established His rule in His kingdom.<br>
   <font size="+1">11.</font> Yet the Father also boweth unto the Power of the 
   Star 418 and thereby<br>

   <font size="+1">1.</font> At the touch of the Fire Qadosh the earth melted into

   <font size="+1">3.</font> At the touch of the Fire Qadosh the air ignited, and

   <font size="+1">5.</font> At the touch of the Fire Qadosh, O Lord, the Space

   Enterer was driven back from the threshold,<br>
