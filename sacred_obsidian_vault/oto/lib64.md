   <li>HB:Vau Priocul, O procul este profani. </li>
   <li>Bahlasti! Ompehda! </li>
   <li>In the name of the Mighty and Terrible One, I proclaim that I have banished 
     the Shells unto their habitations. </li>
   <li>I invoke Tahuti, the Lord of Wisdom and of Utterance, the God that cometh 
     forth from the Veil. </li>
   <li>O Thou! Majesty of Godhead! Wisdom-crowned Tahuti! Lord of the Gates of 
     the Universe! Thee, Thee, I invoke. <br>
     O Thou of the Ibis Head! Thee, Thee I invoke. <br>
     Thou who wieldest the Wand of Double Power! Thee, Thee I invoke! <br>
     Thou who bearest in Thy left hand the Rose and Cross of Light and Life: Thee, 
     Thee, I invoke. <br>
     Thou, whose head is as an emerald, and Thy nemmes as the night-sky blue! Thee, 
     Thee I invoke. <br>
     Thou, whose skin is of flaming orange as though it burned in a furnace! Thee, 
     Thee I invoke. </li>
   <li>Behold! I am Yesterday, To-Day, and the Brother of To-Morrow! <br>
     I am born again and and again. <br>
     Mine is the Unseen Force, whereof the Gods are sprung! Which is as Life unto 
     the Dwellers in the Watch-Towers of the Universe. <br>
     I am the Charioteer of the East, Lord of the Past and of the Future. <br>
     I see by mine own inward light: Lord of Resurrection; Who cometh forth from 
     the Dusk, and my birth is from the House of Death. </li>
   <li>O ye two Divine Hawks upon your Pinnacles! <br>
     Who keep watch over the Universe! <br>
     Ye who company the Bier to the House of Rest! <br>
     Who pilot the Ship of Ra advancing onwards to the heights of heaven! <br>
     Lord of the Shrine which standeth in the Centre of the Earth! </li>
   <li>Behold, He is in me, and I in Him! <br>
     Mine is the Radiance, wherein Ptah floatheth over the firmament! <br>
     I travel upon high! <br>
     I tread upon the firmament of Nu! <br>
     I raise a flashing flame, with the lightning of Mine Eye! <br>
     Ever rushing on, in the splendour of the daily glorified Ra: giving my life 
     to the Dwellers of Earth. </li>
   <li>If I say "Come up upon the mountains!" the Celestial Waters shall 
     flow at my Word.<br>
     For I am Ra incarnate! <br>
     Kephra created in the Flesh! <br>
     I am the Eidolon of my father Tmu, Lord of the City of the Sun! </li>
   <li>The God who commands is in my mouth! <br>
     The God of Wisdom is in my Heart! <br>
     My tongue is the Sanctuary of Truth! <br>
     And a God sitteth upon my lips. </li>
   <li>My Word is accomplished every day! <br>
     And the desire of my heart realises itself, as that of Ptah when He createth! 
     <br>
     I am Eternal; therefore all things are as my designs; therefore do all things 
     obey my Word. </li>
   <li>Therefore do Thou come forth unto me from Thine abode in the Silence: Unutterable 
     Wisdom! All-Light! All-Power! <br>
     Thoth! Hermes! Mercury! Odin! <br>
     By whatever name I call Thee, Thou art still nameless to Eternity:. Come Thou 
     forth, I say, and aid and guard me in this work of Art. </li>
   <li>Thou, Star of the East, that didst conduct the Magi! <br>
     Thou art The Same all-present in Heaven and in Hell! <br>
     Thou that vibratest between the Light and the Darkness! <br>
     Rising, descending! Changing ever, yet ever The Same! <br>
     The Sun is Thy Father! <br>
     Thy Mother is the Moon! <br>
     The Wind hath borne Thee in its bosom: and Earth hath ever nourished the changeless 
     Godhead of Thy Youth! </li>
   <li>Come Thou forth, I say, come Thou forth! <br>
     And make all Spirits subject unto Me: <br>
     So that every Spirit of the Firmament <br>
     And of the Ether. <br>
     And of the Earth. <br>
     And under the Earth. <br>
     On dry land <br>
     And in the Water. <br>
     Of whirling Air <br>
     And of rushing Fire. <br>
     And every Spell and Scourge of God the Vast One, may be obedient unto Me! 
   </li>
   <li>I invoke the priestess of the Silver Star, Asi the Curved One, by the ritual 
     of Silence. </li>
   <li>I make open the gate of Bliss; I descend from the Palace of the Stars; I 
     greet you, I embrace you, O children of Earth, that are gathered together 
     in the Hall of Darkness. </li>
   <li>(A pause.) </li>
   <li>The Speech in the Silence. <br>
     The Words against the Son of Night. <br>
     The Voice of Tahuti in the Universe in the Presence of the Eternal. <br>
     The Formulas of Knowledge. <br>
     The Wisdom of Breath. <br>
     The Root of Vibration. <br>
     The Shaking of the Invisible. <br>
     The Rolling Asunder of the Darkness. <br>
     The Becoming Visible of Matter.<br>
     The Piercing of the Scales of the Crocodile. <br>
     The Breaking Forth of the Light! </li>
   <li>(Follows the Lection.) </li>
   <li>There is an end of the speech; let the Silence of darkness be broken; let 
     it return into the silence of light. </li>
   <li>The speaker silently departs; the listeners disperse unto their homes; yea, 
     they disperse unto their homes.</li>
