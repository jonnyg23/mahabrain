 <p>He goes to the West, in the centre of the base of the Triangle of THOTH (Maim), 
   ASI (Aleph), &amp; HOOR (Shin).</p>
 <blockquote>

     With Ibis head &amp; Phoenix Wand<br>
     And Wings of Night! Whose serpents strain<br>
     Thou in the Light &amp; in the Night! </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>He lays the Wand, etc., on the Altar, uses the Scourge on his buttocks, cuts 
   a cross with the Daggar upon his breast &amp; tightens the Chain of the Bell 
   about his forehead, saying:</p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p>The Lustral Water! Smite thy flood<br>
     Through meÄLymph, marrow &amp; blood! Annointing the Wounds, say<br>
     The Fire Informing! Let the Oil<br>
     Balance, assain, assoil! The Invoking Spiral Dance.<br>
     So Life takes Fire from Death, &amp; runs<br>
     Whirling amid the Suns.<br>
     Hail, Asi! Pace the Path, bind on<br>
     The girdle of the Starry One! <br>
   </p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>Sign of the Enterer: Homage to Thee, Lord of the Word! Sign of Silence: Lord 
   of Silence, Homage to Thee! Repeat both Signs: Lord we adore Thee, still &amp; 
   stirred Beyond Infinity. The Secret Word: MTzThBTzMÄ271 (Blue, Orange, Yellow-Green, 
   Yellow, Orange, Blue) </p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p>For from the Silence of the Wand<br>
     Unto the Speaking of the Sword,<br>
     And back again to the Beyond,<br>
     This is the toil &amp; the Reward.<br>
     This is the Path of HVAÄHo!<br>
     This is the Path of IAO. Bell.<br>
