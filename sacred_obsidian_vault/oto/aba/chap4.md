   THE FORMULA OF ALHIM, AND THAT OF ALIM.</h2>
 "ALHIM", (Elohim) is the exoteric word for Gods. 
 <blockquote><em>"Gods" are the Forces of Nature; their "Names" are the Laws of 
   Nature. Thus They are eternal, omnipotent, omnipresent and so on; and thus their 
   "Wills" are immutable and absolute.</em></blockquote>
 It is the masculine plural of a feminine noun, but its nature is principally feminine. 
 <blockquote><em>It represents Sakti,or Teh; femininity always means form, manifestation. 
   The masculine Siva, or Tao, is always a concealed force.</em></blockquote>
 It is a perfect hieroglyph of the number 5. This should be studied in "A Note 
 on Genesis" (Equinox I, II). 
 <p> The Elements are all represented, as in Tetragrammaton, but there is no development 
   from one into the others. They are, as it were, thrown together --- untamed, 
   only sympathising by virtue of their wild and stormy but elastically resistless 
   energy. The Central letter is "He" --- the letter of breath --- and represents 
   Spirit. The first letter "Aleph" is the natural letter of Air, and the Final 
   "Mem" is the natural letter of Water. Together, "Aleph" and "Mem" make "Am" 
   --- the mother within whose womb the Cosmos is conceived. But "Yod" is not the 
   natural letter of Fire. Its juxtaposition with "He" sanctifies that fire to 
   the "Yod" of Tetragrammaton. Similarly we find "Lamed" for Earth, where we should 
   expect Tau --- in order to emphasize the influence of Venus, who rules Libra. 
 </p><p> "ALHIM", therefore, represents rather the formula of Consecration than that 
   of a complete ceremony. It is the breath of benediction, yet so potent that 
   it can give life to clay and light to darkness. 
 </p><p> In consecrating a weapon, "Aleph" is the whirling force of the thunderbolt, 
   the lightning which flameth out of the East even into the West. This is the 
   gift of the wielding of the thunderbolt of Zeus or Indra, the god of Air. "Lamed" 
   is the Ox-goad, the driving force; and it is also the Balance, representing 
   the truth and love of the Magician. It is the loving care which he bestows upon 
   perfecting his instruments, and the equilibration of that fierce force which 
   initiates the ceremony. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The letters Aleph and Lamed are infinitely important in this Aeon 
   of Horus; they are indeed the Key of the Book of the Law. No more can be said 
   in this place than that Aleph is Harpocrates, Bacchus Diphues, the Holy Ghost, 
   the "Pure Fool" or Innocent Babe who is also the Wandering Singer who impregnates 
   the King's Daughter with Himself as Her Child; Lamed is the King's Daughter, 
   satisfied by Him, holding His "Sword and Balances" in her lap. These weapons 
   are the Judge, armed with power to execute His Will, and Two Witnesses "in whom 
   shall every Truth be established" in accordance with whose testimony he gives 
   judgment.</em></blockquote>
 "Yod" is the creative energy -- the procreative power: and yet "Yod" is the solitude 
 and silence of the hermitage into which the Magician has shut himself. "Mem" is 
 the letter of water, and it is the Mem final, whose long flat lines suggest the 
 Sea at Peace HB:Mem-final ; not the ordinary (initial and medial) Mem whose hieroglyph 
 is a wave HB:Mem. 
 <blockquote><em>In the symbolism above outlined, Yod is the Mercurial "Virgin 
   Word", the Spermatozoon concealing its light under a cloke; and Mem is the amniotic 
   fluid, the flood wherein is the Life-bearing Ark. See A. Crowley "The Ship", 
   Equinox I, X.</em></blockquote>
 And then, in the Centre of all, broods Spirit, which combines the mildness of 
 the Lamb with the horns of the Ram, and is the letter of Bacchus or "Christ". 
 <blockquote><em>The letter He is the formula of Nuith, which makes possible the 
   process described in the previous notes. But it is not permissible here to explain 
   fully the exact matter or manner of this adjustment. I have preferred the exoteric 
   attributions, which are sufficiently informative for the beginner.</em></blockquote>
 After the magician has created his instrument, and balanced it truly, and filled 
 it with the lightnings of his Will, then is the weapon laid away to rest; and 
 in this Silence, a true Consecration comes. 
 <h3 align="center">THE FORMULA OF ALIM</h3>
 It is extremely interesting to contrast with the above the formula of the elemental 
 Gods deprived of the creative spirit. One might suppose that as ALIM, is the masculine 
 plural of the masculine noun AL, its formula would be more virile than that of 
 ALHIM, which is the masculine plural of the feminine noun ALH. A moment's investigation 
 is sufficient to dissipate the illusion. The word masculine has no meaning except 
 in relation to some feminine correlative. 
 <p> The word ALIM may in fact be considered as neuter. By a rather absurd convention, 
   neuter objects are treated as feminine on account of their superficial resemblance 
   in passivity and inertness with the unfertilized female. But the female produces 
   life by the intervention of the male, while the neuter does so only when impregnated 
   by Spirit. Thus we find the feminine AMA, becoming AIMA, 
 </p><blockquote><em>AMA is 42, the number of sterility; AIMA, 52, that of fertility, 
   of BN, the SON.</em></blockquote>
 through the operation of the phallic Yod, while ALIM, the congress of dead elements, 
 only fructifies by the brooding of Spirit. 
 <p> This being so, how can we describe ALIM as containing a Magical Formula? Inquiry 
   discloses the fact that this formula is of a very special kind. 
 </p><p> The word adds up to 81, which is a number of the moon. It is thus the formula 
   of witchcraft, which is under Hecate. 
 </p><blockquote><em>See A. Crowley "Orpheus" for the Invocation of this Goddess.</em></blockquote>
 It is only the romantic mediaeval perversion of science that represents young 
 women as partaking in witchcraft, which is, properly speaking, restricted to the 
 use of such women as are no longer women in the Magical sense of the word, because 
 thy are no longer capable of corresponding to the formula of the male, and are 
 therefore neuter rather than feminine. It is for this reason that their method 
 has always been referred to the moon, in that sense of the term in which she appears, 
 not as the feminine correlative of the sun, but as the burnt-out, dead, airless 
 satellite of earth. 
 <p> No true Magical operation can be performed by the formula of ALIM. All the 
   works of witchcraft are illusory; and their apparent effects depend on the idea 
   that it is possible to alter things by the mere rearrangement of them. One must 
   not rely upon the false analogy of the Xylenes to rebut this argument. It is 
   quite true that geometrical isomers act in different manners towards the substance 
   to which they are brought into relation. And it is of course necessary sometimes 
   to rearrange the elements of a molecule before that molecule can form either 
   the masculine or the feminine element in a true Magical combination with some 
   other molecule. 
 </p><p> It is therefore occasionally inevitable for a Magician to reorganize the structure 
   of certain elements before proceeding to his operation proper. Although such 
   work is technically witchcraft, it must not be regarded as undesirable on that 
   ground, for all operations which do not transmute matter fall strictly speaking 
   under this heading. 
 </p><p> The real objection to this formula is not inherent in its own nature. Witchcraft 
   consists in treating it as the exclusive preoccupation of Magick, and especially 
   in denying to the Holy Spirit his right to indwell His Temple. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The initiate of the XI Degree of O.T.O. will remark that there 
   is a totally different formula of ALIM, complementary with that here discussed. 
   81 may be regarded as a number of Yesod rather than of Luna. The actual meaning 
   of the word may be taken as indicating the formula. Aleph may be referred to 
   Harpocrates, with allusion to the well-known poem of Catullus. Lamed may imply 
   the exaltation of Saturn, and suggest the Three of Swords in a particular manner. 
   Yod will then recall Hermes, and Mem the Hanged Man. We have thus a Tetragrammaton 
   which contains no feminine component. The initial Force is here the Holy Spirit 
   and its vehicle or weapon the "Sword and Balances". Justice is then done upon 
   the Mercurial "Virgin", with the result that the Man is "Hanged" or extended, 
   and is slain in this manner. Such an operation makes creation impossible --- 
   as in the former case; but here there is no question of re-arrangement; the 
   creative force is employed deliberately for destruction, and is entirely absorbed 
   in its own sphere (or cylinder, on Einstein's equations) of action. This Work 
   is to be regarded as "Holiness to the Lord". The Hebrews, in fact, conferred 
   the title of Qadosh (holy) upon its adepts. Its effect is to consecrate the 
   Magicians who perform it in a very special way. We may take note also of the 
   correspondence of Nine with Teth, XI, Leo, and the Serpent. The great merits 
   of this formula are that it avoids contact with the inferior planes, that it 
   is self-sufficient, that it involves no responsibilities, and that it leaves 
   its masters not only stronger in themselves, but wholly free to fulfil their 
   essential Natures. Its abuse is an abomination.</em></blockquote>
