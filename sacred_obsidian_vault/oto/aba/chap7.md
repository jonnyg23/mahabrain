   THE FORMULA OF THE HOLY GRAAL:<br>
   OF ABRAHADABRA:<br>
   "and of certain other Words."<br>
   Also: THE MAGICAL MEMORY.</h2>
 The Hieroglyph shewn in the Seventh Key of the Tarot (described in the 12th Aethyr, 
 Liber 418, Equinox I, V) is the Charioteer of OUR LADY BABALON, whose Cup or Graal 
 he hears. 
 <p> Now this is an important formula. It is the First of the Formulae, in a sense, 
   for it is the formula of Renunciation. 
 </p><blockquote><em>There is no moral implication here. But to choose A implies to 
   refuse not-A: at least, that is so, below the Abyss.</em></blockquote>
 It is also the Last! 
 <p> This Cup is said to be full of the Blood of the Saints; that is, every "saint" 
   or magician must give the last drop of his life's blood to that cup. It is the 
   original price paid for magick power. And if by magick power we mean the true 
   power, the assimilation of all force with the Ultimate Light, the true Bridal 
   of the Rosy Cross, then is that blood the offering of Virginity, the sole sacrifice 
   well-pleasing to the Master, the sacrifice whose only reward is the pain of 
   child-bearing unto him. 
 </p><p> But "to sell one's soul to the devil", to renounce no matter what for an equivalent 
   in personal gain, 
 </p><blockquote><em>"Supposed" personal gain. There is really no person to gain; so 
   the whole transaction is a swindle on both sides.</em></blockquote>
 is black magic. You are no longer a noble giver of your all, but a mean huckster. 
 <p> This formula is, however, a little different in symbolism, since it is a Woman 
   whose Cup must be filled. It is rather the sacrifice of the Man, who transfers 
   life to his descendants. For a woman does not carry in herself the principle 
   of new life, except temporarily, when it is given her. But here the formula 
   implies much more even than this. For it is his whole life that the Magus offers 
   to OUR LADY. The Cross is both Death and Generation, and it is on the Cross 
   that the Rose blooms. The full significance of these symbols is so lofty that 
   it is hardly fitted for an elementary treatise of this type. One must be an 
   Exempt Adept, and have become ready to pass on, before one can see the symbols 
   even from the lower plane. Only a Master of the Temple can fully understand 
   them. 
 </p><p> (However, the reader may study Liber CLVI, in Equinox I, VI, the 12th and 
   2nd Aethyrs in Liber 418 in Equinox I, V, and the Symbolism of the V Degree 
   and VI Degree in O.T.O.) 
 </p><p> Of the preservation of this blood which OUR LADY offers to the ANCIENT ONE, 
   CHAOS 
 </p><blockquote><em>CHAOS is a general name for the totality of the Units of Existence; 
   it is thus a name feminine in form. Each unit of CHAOS is itself All-Father.</em></blockquote>
 the All-Father, to revive him, and of how his divine Essence fills the Daughter 
 (the soul of Man) and places her upon the Throne of the Mother, fulfilling the 
 Economy of the Universe, and thus ultimately rewarding the Magician (the Son) 
 ten thousandfold, it would be still more improper to speak in this place. So holy 
 a mystery is the Arcanum of the Masters of the Temple, that it is here hinted 
 at in order to blind the presumptuous who may, unworthy, seek to lift the veil, 
 and at the same time to lighten the darkness of such as may be requiring only 
 one ray of the Sun in order to spring into life and light. 
 <h3 align="center">II</h3>
 ABRAHADABRA is a word to be studied in Equinox I, V., "The Temple of Solomon the 
 King". It represents the Great Work complete, and it is therefore an archetype 
 of all lesser magical operations. It is in a way too perfect to be applied in 
 advance to any of them. But an example of such an operation may be studied in 
 Equinox I, VII, "The Temple of Solomon the King", where an invocation of Horus 
 on this formula is given in full. Note the reverberation of the ideas one against 
 another. The formula of Horus has not yet been so fully worked out in details 
 as to justify a treatise upon its exoteric theory and practice; but one may say 
 that it is, to the formula of Osiris, what the turbine is to the reciprocating 
 engine. 
 <h3 align="center">III</h3>
 There are many other sacred words which enshrine formulae of great efficacity 
 in particular operations. 
 <p> For example, V.I.T.R.I.O.L. gives a certain Regimen of the Planets useful 
   in Alchemical work. Ararita is a formula of the macrocosm potent in certain 
   very lofty Operations of the Magick of the Inmost Light. (See Liber 813.) 
 </p><p> The formula of Thelema may be summarized thus: Theta "Babalon and the Beast 
   conjoined" --- epsilon unto Nuith (CCXX, I, 51) --- lambda The Work accomplished 
   in Justice --- eta The Holy Graal --- mu The Water therein --- alpha The Babe 
   in the Egg (Harpocrates on the Lotus.) 
 </p><p> That of "Agape" is as follows: 
 </p><p> Dionysus (Capital Alpha) --- The Virgin Earth gamma --- The Babe in the Egg 
   (small alpha --- the image of the Father) --- The Massacre of the Innocents, 
   pi (winepress) --- The Draught of Ecstasy, eta. 
 </p><p> The student will find it well worth his while to seek out these ideas in detail, 
   and develop the technique of their application. 
 </p><p> There is also the Gnostic Name of the Seven Vowels, which gives a musical 
   formula most puissant in evocations of the Soul of Nature. There is moreover 
   ABRAXAS; there is XNOUBIS; there is MEITHRAS; and indeed it may briefly be stated 
   that every true name of God gives the formula of the invocation of that God. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Members of the IV Degree of the O.T.O. are well aware of a Magick 
   Word whose analysis contains all truth, human and Divine, a word indeed potent 
   for any group which dares to use it.</em></blockquote>
 It would therefore be impossible, even were it desirable, to analyse all such 
 names. The general method of doing so has been given, and the magician must himself 
 work out his own formula for particular cases. 
 <blockquote><em>The Holy Qabalah (see Liber D in Equinox I, VIII, Supplement, 
   and Liber 777) affords the means of analysis and application required. See also 
   Equinox I, V, "The Temple of Solomon The King".</em></blockquote>
 <h3 align="center">IV.</h3>
 It should also be remarked that every grade has its peculiar magical formula. 
 Thus, the formula of Abrahadabra concerns us, as men, principally because each 
 of us represents the pentagram or microcosm; and our equilibration must therefore 
 be with the hexagram or macrocosm. In other words, 5 Degree = 6Square is the formula 
 of the Solar operation; but then 6 Degree = 5Square is the formula of the Martial 
 operation, and this reversal of the figures implies a very different Work. In 
 the former instance the problem was to dissolve the microcosm in the macrocosm; 
 but this other problem is to separate a particular force from the macrocosm, just 
 as a savage might hew out a flint axe from the deposits in a chalk cliff. Similarly, 
 an operation of Jupiter will be of the nature of the equilibration of him with 
 Venus. Its graphic formula will be 7 Degree = 4Square, and there will be a word 
 in which the character of this operation is described, just as Abrahadabra describes 
 the Operation of the Great Work. 
 <p> It may be stated without unfairness, as a rough general principle, that the 
   farther from original equality are the two sides of the equation, the more difficult 
   is the operation to perform. 
 </p><p> Thus, to take the case of the personal operation symbolized by the grades, 
   it is harder to become a Neophyte, 1'=10', than to pass from that grade to Zelator, 
   2'=9'. 
 </p><p> Initiation is, therefore, progressively easier, in a certain sense, after 
   the first step is taken. But (especially after the passing of Tiphareth) the 
   distance between grade and grade increases as it were by a geometrical progression 
   with an enormously high factor, which itself progresses. 
 </p><blockquote><em>A suggestion has recently been made that the Hierarchy of the 
   Grades should be "destroyed, and replaced by" --- a ring system of 13 grades 
   all equal. There is, of course, one sense in which every grade is a Thing-in-Itself. 
   But the Hierarchy is only a convenient method of classifying observed facts. 
   One is reminded of the Democracy, who, on being informed by the Minister of 
   the Interior that the scarcity of provisions was due to the Law of Supply and 
   Demand, passed a unanimous resolution calling for the immediate repeal of that 
   iniquitous measure! 
   <p> Every person, whatever his grade in the Order, has also a "natural" grade 
     appropriate to his intrinsic virtue. He may expect to be "cast out" into that 
     grade when he becomes 8'=3'. Thus one man, throughout his career, may be essentially 
     of the type of Netzach; another, of Hod. In the same way Rembrandt and Raphael 
     retained their respective points of view in all stages of their art. The practical 
     consideration is that some aspirants may find it unusually difficult to attain 
     certain grades; or, worse, allow their inherent predispositions to influence 
     them to neglect antipathetic, and indulge sympathetic, types of work. They 
     may thus become more unbalanced than ever, with disastrous results. Success 
     in one's favourite pursuit is a temptress; whose yields to her wiles limits 
     his own growth. True, every Will is partial; but, even so, it can only fulfill 
     itself by symmetrical expansion. It must be adjusted to the Universe, or fail 
     of perfection. 
   </p></em></blockquote>
 <p> It is evidently impossible to give details of all these formulae. Before beginning 
   any operation soever the magician must make a through Qabalistic study of it 
   so as to work out its theory in symmetry of perfection. Preparedness in Magick 
   is as important as it is in War. 
 </p><h3 align="center">V</h3>
 It should be profitable to make a somewhat detailed study of the strange-looking 
 word AUMGN, for its analysis affords an excellent illustration of the principles 
 on which the Practicus may construct his own Sacred Words. 
 <p> This word has been uttered by the MASTER THERION himself, as a means of declaring 
   his own personal work as the Beast, the Logos of the Aeon. To understand it, 
   we must make a preliminary consideration of the word which it replaces and from 
   which it was developed: the word AUM. 
 </p><p> The word AUM is the sacred Hindu mantra which was the supreme hieroglyph of 
   Truth, a compendium of the Sacred Knowledge. Many volumes have been written 
   with regard to it; but, for our present purpose, it will be necessary only to 
   explain how it came to serve for the representation of the principal philosophical 
   tenets of the Rishis. 
 </p><p> Firstly, it represents the complete course of sound. It is pronounced by forcing 
   the breath from the back of the throat with the mouth wide open, through the 
   buccal cavity with the lips so shaped as to modify the sound from A to O (or 
   U), to the closed lips, when it becomes M. Symbolically, this announces the 
   course of Nature as proceeding from free and formless creation through controlled 
   and formed preservation to the silence of destruction. The three sounds are 
   harmonized into one; and thus the word represents the Hindu Trinity of Brahma, 
   Vishnu, and Shiva; and the operations in the Universe of their triune energy. 
   It is thus the formula of a Manvantara, or period of manifested existence, which 
   alternates with a Pralaya, during which creation is latent. 
 </p><p> Analysed Qabalistically, the word is found to possess similar properties. 
   A is the negative, and also the unity which concentrates it into a positive 
   form. A is the Holy Spirit who begets God in flesh upon the Virgin, according 
   to the formula familiar to students of "The Golden Bough". A is also the "babe 
   in the Egg" thus produced. The quality of A is thus bisexual. It is the original 
   being --- Zeus Arrhenothelus, Bacchus Diphues, or Baphomet. 
 </p><p> U or V is the manifested son himself. Its number is 6. It refers therefore, 
   to the dual nature of the Logos as divine and human; the interlacing of the 
   upright and averse triangles in the hexagram. It is the first number of the 
   Sun, whose last number 
 </p><blockquote><em>The Sun being 6, a square 6x6 contains 36 squares. We arrange 
   the numbers from 1 to 36 in this square, so that each line, file, and diagonal 
   adds to the same number. This number is 111; the total of all is 666.</em></blockquote>
 is 666, "the number of a man". 
 <p> The letter M exhibits the termination of this process. It is the Hanged Man 
   of the Tarot; the formation of the individual from the absolute is closed by 
   his death. 
 </p><p> We see accordingly how AUM is, on either system, the expression of a dogma 
   which implies catastrophe in nature. It is cognate with the formula of the Slain 
   God. The "resurrection" and "ascension" are not implied in it. They are later 
   inventions without basis in necessity; they may be described indeed as Freudian 
   phantasms conjured up by the fear of facing reality. To the Hindu, indeed, they 
   are still less respectable. in his view, existence is essentially objectionable 
 </p><blockquote><em>Thelemites agree that manifested existence implies Imperfection. 
   But they understand why Perfection devises this disguise. The Theory is developed 
   fully in Liber Aleph, and in Part IV of this Book 4. See also Cap V Paragraph 
   on Digamma final of Digamma-Iota-Alpha-Omicron-Digamma.</em></blockquote>
 ; and his principle concern is to invoke Shiva 
 <blockquote><em>The Vaishnava theory, superficially opposed to this, turns out 
   on analysis to be practically identical.</em></blockquote>
 to destroy the illusion whose thrall is the curse of the Manvantara. 
 <p> The cardinal revelation of the Great Aeon of Horus is that this formula AUM 
   does not represent the facts of nature. The point of view is based upon misapprehension 
   of the character of existence. It soon became obvious to The Master Therion 
   that AUM was an inadequate and misleading hieroglyph. It stated only part of 
   the truth, and it implied a fundamental falsehood. He consequently determined 
   to modify the word in such a manner as to fit it to represent the Arcana unveiled 
   by the Aeon of which He had attained to be the Logos. 
 </p><p> The essential task was to emphasize the fact that nature is not catastrophic, 
   but proceeds by means of undulations. It might be suggested that Manvantara 
   and Pralaya are in reality complementary curves; but the Hindu doctrine insists 
   strongly on denying continuity to the successive phases. It was nevertheless 
   important to avoid disturbing the Trinitarian arrangement of the word, as would 
   be done by the addition of other letters. It was equally desirable to make it 
   clear that the letter M represents an operation which does not actually occur 
   in nature except as the withdrawal of phenomena into the absolute; which process, 
   even when so understood, is not a true destruction, but, on the contrary, the 
   emancipation of anything from the modifications which it had mistaken for itself. 
   It occurred to him that the true nature of Silence was to permit the uninterrupted 
   vibration of the undulatory energy, free from the false conceptions attached 
   to it by the Ahamkara or Ego-making facility, whose assumption that conscious 
   individuality constitutes existence let it to consider its own apparently catastrophic 
   character as pertaining to the order of nature. 
 </p><p> The undulatory formula of putrefaction is represented in the Qabalah by the 
   letter N, which refers to Scorpio, whose triune nature combines the Eagle, Snake 
   and Scorpion. These hieroglyphs themselves indicate the spiritual formulae of 
   incarnation. He was also anxious to use the letter G, another triune formula 
   expressive of the aspects of the moon, which further declares the nature of 
   human existence in the following manner. The moon is in itself a dark orb; but 
   an appearance of light is communicated to it by the sun; and it is exactly in 
   this way that successive incarnations create the appearance, just as the individual 
   star, which every man is, remains itself, irrespective of whether earth perceives 
   it or not. 
 </p><p> Now it so happens that the root GN signifies both knowledge and generation 
   combined in a single idea, in an absolute form independent of personality. The 
   G is a silent letter, as in our word Gnosis; and the sound GN is nasal, suggesting 
   therefore the breath of life as opposed to that of speech. Impelled by these 
   considerations, the Master Therion proposed to replace the M of AUM by a compound 
   letter MGN, symbolizing thereby the subtle transformation of the apparent silence 
   and death which terminates the manifested life of Vau by a continuous vibration 
   of an impersonal energy of the nature of generation and knowledge, the Virgin 
   Moon and the Serpent furthermore operating to include in the idea a commemoration 
   of the legend so grossly deformed in the Hebrew legend of the Garden of Eden, 
   and its even more malignantly debased falsification in that bitterly sectarian 
   broadside, the Apocalypse. 
 </p><p> Sound work invariable vindicates itself by furnishing confirmatory corollaries 
   not contemplated by the Qabalist. In the present instance, the Master Therion 
   was delighted to remark that his compound letter MGN, constructed on theoretical 
   principles with the idea of incorporating the new knowledge of the Aeon, had 
   the value of 93 (M = 40, G = 3, N = 50). 93 is the number of the word of the 
   Law --- Thelema --- Will, and of Agape --- Love, which indicates the nature 
   of Will. It is furthermore the number of the Word which overcomes death, as 
   members of the degree of M M of the O.T.O. are well aware; 
 </p><blockquote><em>WEH NOTE: III Degree O.T.O., a word never to be written, published 
   or spoken without the rite.</em></blockquote>
 and it is also that of the complete formula of existence as expressed in the True 
 Word of the Neophyte, 
 <blockquote><em>WEH NOTE: Another unpublished word, this time belonging to the 
   A.'. A.'. and not to O.T.O. The two words are different, even to the number 
   of letters. It was written down once, in a letter to Frank Bennett.</em></blockquote>
 where existence is taken to import that phase of the whole which is the finite 
 resolution of the Qabalistic Zero. 
 <p> Finally, the total numeration of the Word AUMGN is 100, which, as initiates 
   of the Sanctuary of the Gnosis of the O.T.O. 
 </p><blockquote><em>WEH NOTE: IX Degree O.T.O.</em></blockquote>
 are taught, expresses the unity under the form of complete manifestation by the 
 symbolism of pure number, being Kether by Aiq Bkr 
 <blockquote><em>A method of exegesis in which 1 = 10 = 100, 2 = 20 = 200, etc.</em></blockquote>
 ; also Malkuth multiplied by itself 
 <blockquote><em>10 to the 2 power = 100.</em></blockquote>
 , and thus established in the phenomenal universe. But, moreover, this number 
 100 mysteriously indicates the Magical formula of the Universe as a reverberatory 
 engine for the extension of Nothingness through the device of equilibrated opposites. 
 <blockquote><em>Koph-Pehfinal = 100 (20 + 80). HB:Koph = chi = Kappa-tau-epsilon-iota-sigma: 
   HB:Pehfinal = phi = Phi-alpha-lambda-lambda-omicron-sigma; (by Notariqon).</em></blockquote>
 It is moreover the value of the letter Qoph, which means "the back of the head", 
 the cerebellum, where the creative or reproductive force is primarily situated. 
 Qoph in the Tarot is "the Moon", a card suggesting illusion, yet shewing counterpartal 
 forces operating in darkness, and the Winged Beetle or Midnight Sun in his Bark 
 travelling through the Nadir. Its Yetziratic attribution is Pisces, symbolic of 
 the positive and negative currents of fluidic energy, the male Ichthus or "Pesce" 
 and the female Vesica, seeking respectively the anode and kathode. The number 
 100 is therefore a synthetic glyph of the subtle energies employed in creating 
 the Illusion, or Reflection of Reality, which we call manifested existence. 
 <p> The above are the principal considerations in the matter of AUMGN. They should 
   suffice to illustrate to the student the methods employed in the construction 
   of the hieroglyphics of Magick, and to arm him with a mantra of terrific power 
   by virtue whereof he may apprehend the Universe, and control in himself its 
   Karmic consequences. 
 </p><h3 align="center">VI 
   </h3><p> THE MAGICAL MEMORY. 
 
 </p><blockquote><em>WEH NOTE: This is not the same "Magical Memory" as that described 
   by F. A. Yates and used by the ancient Roman orators for mnemonics.</em></blockquote>
 <h3 align="center">I</h3>
 There is no more important task than the exploration of one's previous incarnations. 
 <blockquote><em>It has been objected to reincarnation that the population of this 
   planet has been increasing rapidly. Where do the new souls come from? It is 
   not necessary to invent theories about other planets; it is enough to say that 
   the earth is passing through a period when human units are being built up from 
   the elements with increased frequency. The evidence for this theory springs 
   to the eye: in what other age was there such puerility, such lack of race-experience, 
   such reliance upon incoherent formulas? (Contrast the infantile emotionalism 
   and credulity of the average "well-educated" Anglo-Saxon with the shrewd common 
   sense of the normal illiterate peasant.) A large proportion of mankind today 
   is composed of "souls" who are living the human life for the first time. Note 
   especially the incredible spread of congenital homosexuality and other sexual 
   deficiencies in many forms. These are the people who have not understood, accepted, 
   and used even the Formula of Osiris. Kin to them are the "once-born" of William 
   James, who are incapable of philosophy, magick, or even religion, but seek instinctively 
   a refuge from the horror of contemplating Nature, which they do not comprehend, 
   in soothing-syrup affirmations such as those of Christian Science, Spiritualism, 
   and all the sham 'occult' creeds, as well as the emasculated forms of so-called 
   Christianity.</em></blockquote>
 As Zoroaster says: "Explore the river of the soul; whence and in what order thou 
 has come." One cannot do one's True Will intelligently unless one knows what it 
 is. Liber Thisarb, Equinox I, VII, give instructions for determining this by calculating 
 the resultant of the forces which have made one what one is. But this practice 
 is confined to one's present incarnation. 
 <p> If one were to wake up in a boat on a strange river, it would be rash to conclude 
   that the direction of the one reach visible was that of the whole stream. It 
   would help very much if one remembered the bearings of previous reaches traversed 
   before one's nap. It would further relieve one's anxiety when one became aware 
   that a uniform and constant force was the single determinant of all the findings 
   of the stream: gravitation. We could rejoice "that even the weariest river winds 
   somewhere safe to sea." 
 </p><p> Liber Thisarb describes a method of obtaining the Magical Memory by learning 
   to remember backwards. But the careful practice of Dharana is perhaps more generally 
   useful. As one prevents the more accessible thoughts from arising, we strike 
   deeper strata --- memories of childhood reawaken. Still deeper lies a class 
   of thoughts whose origin puzzles us. Some of these apparently belong to former 
   incarnations. By cultivating these departments of one's mind we can develop 
   them; we become expert; we form an organized coherence of these originally disconnected 
   elements; the faculty grows with astonishing rapidity, once the knack of the 
   business is mastered. 
 </p><p> It is much easier (for obvious reasons) to acquire the Magical Memory when 
   one has been sworn for many lives to reincarnate immediately. The great obstacle 
   is the phenomenon called Freudian forgetfulness; that is to say, that, though 
   an unpleasant event may be recorded faithfully enough by the mechanism of the 
   brain, we fail to recall it, or recall it wrong, because it is painful. "The 
   Psychopathology of Everyday Life" analyses and illustrates this phenomenon in 
   detail. Now, the King of Terrors being Death, it is hard indeed to look it in 
   the face. Mankind has created a host of phantastic masks; people talk of "going 
   to heaven", "passing over", and so on; banners flaunted from pasteboard towers 
   of baseless theories. One instinctively flinches from remembering one's last, 
   as one does from imagining one's next, death. 
 </p><blockquote><em>This later is a very valuable practice to perform. See Liber HHH; 
   also read up the Buddhist meditations of the Ten Impurities. {WEH NOTE ADENDA: 
   Right, but it scares the dickens out of you! When I succeeded in the practice 
   in my teens, I panicked out of using the related abilities for several years. 
   This was without benefit of initiation.}</em></blockquote>
 The point of view of the initiate helps one immensely. 
 <p> As soon as one has passed this Pons Asinorum, the practice becomes much easier. 
   It is much less trouble to reach the life before the last; familiarity with 
   death breeds contempt for it. 
 </p><p> It is a very great assistance to the beginner if he happens to have some intellectual 
   grounds for identifying himself with some definite person in the immediate past. 
   A brief account of Aleister Crowley's good fortune in this matter should be 
   instructive. It will be seen that the points of contact vary greatly in character. 
   1. The date of Eliphas Levi's death was about six months previous to that of 
   Aleister Crowley's birth. The reincarnating ego is supposed to take possession 
   of the foetus at about this stage of development. 
 </p><p> 2. Eliphas Levi had a striking personal resemblance to Aleister Crowley's 
   father. This of course merely suggests a certain degree of suitability from 
   a physical point of view. 
 </p><p> 3. Aleister Crowley wrote a play called "The Fatal Force" at a time when he 
   had not read any of Eliphas Levi's works. The motive of this play is a Magical 
   Operation of a very peculiar kind. The formula which Aleister Crowley supposed 
   to be his original idea is mentioned by Levi. We have not been able to trace 
   it anywhere else with such exact correspondence in every detail. 
 </p><p> 4. Aleister Crowley found a certain quarter of Paris incomprehensibly familiar 
   and attractive to him. This was not the ordinary phenomenon of the "deja vu", 
   it was chiefly a sense of being at home again. He discovered long after that 
   Levi had lived in the neighbourhood for many years. 
 </p><p> 5. There are many curious similarities between the events of Eliphas Levi's 
   life and that of Aleister Crowley. The intention of the parents that their son 
   should have a religious career; the inability to make use of very remarkable 
   talents in any regular way; the inexplicable ostracism which afflicted him, 
   and whose authors seemed somehow to be ashamed of themselves; the events relative 
   to marriage: 
 </p><blockquote><em>Levi, on her deliberately abandoning him, withdrew his protection 
   from his wife; she lost her beauty and intelligence, and became the prey of 
   an aged and hideous pithecoid. Aleister Crowley's wife insisted upon doing her 
   own will, as she defined it; this compelled him to stand aside. What happened 
   to Mme. Constant happened to her, although in a more violent and disastrous 
   form.</em></blockquote>
 all these offer surprisingly close parallels. 
 <p> 6. The characters of the two men present subtle identities in many points. 
   Both seem to be constantly trying to reconcile insuperable antagonisms. Both 
   find it hard to destroy the delusion that men's fixed beliefs and customs may 
   be radically altered by a few friendly explanations. Both show a curious fondness 
   for out-the-way learning, preferring recondite sources of knowledge they adopt 
   eccentric appearances. Both inspire what can only be called panic fear in absolute 
   strangers, who can give no reason whatever for a repulsion which sometimes almost 
   amounts to temporary insanity. The ruling passion in each case is that of helping 
   humanity. Both show quixotic disregard of their personal prosperity, and even 
   comfort, yet both display love of luxury and splendour. Both have the pride 
   of Satan. 
 </p><p> 7. When Aleister Crowley became Frater Omicron-Upsilon Mu-Eta and had to write 
   his thesis for the grade of Adeptus Exemptus, he had already collected his ideas 
   when Levi's "Clef des Grands Mysteres" fell into his hands. It was remarkable 
   that he, having admired Levi for many years, and even begun to suspect the identity, 
   had not troubled (although an extravagant buyer of books) to get this particular 
   work. He found, to his astonishment, that almost everything that he had himself 
   intended to say was there written. The result of this was that he abandoned 
   writing his original work, and instead translated the masterpiece in question. 
 </p><p> 8. The style of the two men is strikingly similar in numerous subtle and deep-seated 
   ways. The general point of view is almost identical. The quality of the irony 
   is the same. Both take a perverse pleasure in playing practical jokes on the 
   reader. In one point, above all, the identity is absolute --- there is no third 
   name in literature which can be put in the same class. The point is this: In 
   a single sentence is combined sublimity and enthusiasm with sneering bitterness, 
   scepticism, grossness and scorn. It is evidently the supreme enjoyment to strike 
   a chord composed of as many conflicting elements as possible. The pleasure seems 
   to be derived from gratifying the sense of power, the power to compel every 
   possible element of thought to contribute to the spasm. 
 </p><p> If the theory of reincarnation were generally accepted, the above considerations 
   would make out a strong case. FRATER PERDURABO was quite convinced in one part 
   of his mind of this identity, long before he got any actual memories as such. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Long since writing the above, the publication of the biography 
   of Eliphas Levi by M. Paul Chacornat has confirmed the hypothesis in innumerable 
   striking ways.</em></blockquote>
 <h3 align="center">II</h3>
 Unless one has a groundwork of this sort to start with, one must get back to one's 
 life as best one can by the methods above indicated. It may be of some assistance 
 to give a few characteristics of genuine Magical Memory; to mention a few sources 
 of error, and to lay down critical rules for the verification of one's results. 
 <p> The first great danger arises from vanity. One should always beware of "remembering" 
   that one was Cleopatra or Shakespeare. 
 </p><p> Again, superficial resemblances are usually misleading. 
 </p><p> One of the great tests of the genuineness of any recollection is that one 
   remembers the really important things in one's life, not those which mankind 
   commonly classes as such. For instance, Aleister Crowley does not remember any 
   of the decisive events in the life of Eliphas Levi. He recalls intimate trivialities 
   of childhood. He has a vivid recollection of certain spiritual crises; in particular, 
   one which was fought out as he paced up and down a lonely stretch of road in 
   a flat and desolate district. He remembers ridiculous incidents, such as often 
   happen at suppers when the conversation takes a turn such that its gaiety somehow 
   strikes to the soul, and one receives a supreme revelation which is yet perfectly 
   inarticulate. He has forgotten his marriage and its tragic results, 
 </p><blockquote><em>It is perhaps significant that although the name of the woman 
   has been familiar to him since 1898, he has never been able to commit it to 
   memory.</em></blockquote>
 although the plagiarism which Fate has been shameless enough to perpetrate in 
 this present life, would naturally, one might think, reopen the wound. 
 <p> There is a sense which assures us intuitively when we are running on a scent 
   breast high. There is an "oddness" about the memory which is somehow annoying. 
   It gives a feeling of shame and guiltiness. There is a tendency to blush. One 
   feels like a schoolboy caught red-handed in the act of writing poetry. There 
   is the same sort of feeling as one has when one finds a faded photograph or 
   a lock of hair twenty years old among the rubbish in some forgotten cabinet. 
   This feeling is independent of the question whether the thing remembered was 
   in itself a source of pleasure or of pain. Can it be that we resent the idea 
   of our "previous condition of servitude"? We want to forget the past, however 
   good reason we may have to be proud of it. It is well known that many men are 
   embarrassed in the presence of a monkey. 
 </p><p> When the "loss of face" does not occur, distrust the accuracy of the item 
   which you recall, The only reliable recollections which present themselves with 
   serenity are invariably connected with what men call disasters. Instead of the 
   feeling of being caught in the slips, one has that of being missed at the wicket. 
   One has the sly satisfaction of having done an outrageously foolish thing and 
   got off scot free. When one sees life in perspective, it is an immense relief 
   to discover that things like bankruptcy, wedlock, and the gallows made no particular 
   difference. They were only accidents such as might happen to anybody; they had 
   no real bearing on the point at issue. One consequently remembers having one's 
   ears cropped as a lucky escape, while the causal jest of a drunken skeinsmate 
   in an all-night cafe stings one with the shame of the parvenu to whom a polite 
   stranger has unsuspectingly mentioned "Mine Uncle". 
 </p><p> The testimony of intuitions is, however, strictly subjective, and shrieks 
   for collateral security. It would be a great error to ask too much. In consequence 
   of the peculiar character of the recollections which are under the microscope, 
   anything in the shape of gross confirmation almost presumes perjury. A pathologist 
   would arouse suspicion if he said that his bacilli had arranged themselves on 
   the slide so as to spell Staphylococcus. We distrust an arrangement of flowers 
   which tells us that "Life is worth living in Detroit, Michigan". Suppose that 
   Aleister Crowley remembers that he was Sir Edward Kelly. It does not follow 
   that he will be able to give us details of Cracow in the time of James I of 
   England. Material events are the words of an arbitrary language; the symbols 
   of a cipher previously agreed on. What happened to Kelly in Cracow may have 
   meant something to him, but there is no reason to presume that it has any meaning 
   for his successor. There is an obvious line of criticism about any recollection. 
   It must not clash with ascertained facts. For example --- one cannot have two 
   lives which overlap, unless there is reason to suppose that the earlier died 
   spiritually before his body ceased to breathe. This might happen in certain 
   cases, such as insanity. 
 </p><p> It is not conclusive against a previous incarnation that the present should 
   be inferior to the past. One's life may represent the full possibilities of 
   a certain partial Karma. One may have devoted one's incarnation to discharging 
   the liabilities of one part of one's previous character. For instance, one might 
   devote a lifetime to settling the bill run up by Napoleon for causing unnecessary 
   suffering, with the object of starting afresh, clear of debt, in a life devoted 
   to reaping the reward of the Corsican's invaluable services to the race. 
 </p><p> The Master Therion, in fact, remembers several incarnations of almost uncompensated 
   wretchedness, anguish and humiliation, voluntarily undertaken so that he might 
   resume his work unhampered by spiritual creditors. 
 </p><p> These are the stigmata. Memory is hall-marked by its correspondence with the 
   facts actually observed in the present. This correspondence may be of two kinds. 
   It is rare (and it is unimportant for the reasons stated above) that one's memory 
   should be confirmed by what may be called, contemptuously, external evidence. 
   It was indeed a reliable contribution to psychology to remark that an evil and 
   adulterous generation sought for a sign. 
 </p><p> (Even so, the permanent value of the observation is to trace the genealogy 
   of the Pharisee --- from Caiaphas to the modern Christian.) 
 </p><p> Signs mislead, from "Painless Dentistry" upwards. The fact that anything is 
   intelligible proves that it is addressed to the wrong quarter, because the very 
   existence of language presupposes impotence to communicate directly. When Walter 
   Raleigh flung his cloak upon the muddy road, he merely expressed, in a cipher 
   contrived by a combination of circumstances, his otherwise inexpressible wish 
   to get on good terms with Queen Elizabeth. The significance of his action was 
   determined by the concourse of circumstances. The reality can have no reason 
   for reproducing itself exclusively in that especial form. It can have no reason 
   for remembering that so extravagant a ritual happened to be necessary to worship. 
   Therefore, however well a man might remember his incarnation as Julius Caesar, 
   there is no necessity for his representing his power to set all upon the hazard 
   of a die by imagining the Rubicon. Any spiritual state can be symbolized by 
   an infinite variety of actions in an infinite variety of circumstances. One 
   should recollect only those events which happen to be immediately linked with 
   one's peculiar tendencies to imagine one thing rather than another. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The exception is when some whimsical circumstance ties a knot 
   in the corner of one's mnemonic handkerchief.</em></blockquote>
 Genuine recollections almost invariably explain oneself to oneself. Suppose, for 
 example, that you feel an instinctive aversion to some particular kind of wine. 
 Try as you will, you can find no reason for your idiosyncrasy. Suppose, then, 
 that when you explore some previous incarnation, you remember that you died by 
 a poison administered in a wine of that character, your aversion is explained 
 by the proverb, "A burnt child dreads the fire." It may be objected that in such 
 a case your libido has created a phantasm of itself in the manner which Freud 
 has explained. The criticism is just, but its value is reduced if it should happen 
 that you were not aware of its existence until your Magical Memory attracted your 
 attention to it. In fact, the essence of the test consists in this: that your 
 memory notifies you of something which is the logical conclusion of the premisses 
 postulated by the past. 
 <p> As an example, we may cite certain memories of the Master Therion. He followed 
   a train of thought which led him to remember his life as a Roman named Marius 
   de Aquila. It would be straining probability to presume a connection between 
   (alpha) this hieroglyphically recorded mode of self-analysis and (beta) ordinary 
   introspection conducted on principles intelligible to himself. He remembers 
   directly various people and various events connected with this incarnation; 
   and they are in themselves to all appearance actual. There is no particular 
   reason why they, rather than any others, should have entered his sphere. In 
   the act of remembering them, they are absolute. He can find no reason for correlating 
   them with anything in the present. But a subsequent examination of the record 
   shows that the logical result of the Work of Marius de Aquila did not occur 
   to that romantic reprobate; in point of fact, he died before anything could 
   happen. Can we suppose that any cause can be baulked of effect? The Universe 
   is unanimous in rebuttal. If then the exact effects which might be expected 
   to result from these causes are manifested in the career of the Master Therion, 
   it is assuredly the easiest and most reasonable explanation to assume an identity 
   between the two men. Nobody is shocked to observe that the ambition of Napoleon 
   has diminished the average stature of Frenchmen. We know that somehow or other 
   every force must find its fulfilment; and those people who have grasped the 
   fact that external events are merely symptoms of external ideas, cannot find 
   any difficulty in attributing the correspondences of the one to the identities 
   of the other. Far be it from any apologist for Magick to insist upon the objective 
   validity of these concatenations! It would be childish to cling to the belief 
   that Marius de Aquila actually existed; it matters no more that it matters to 
   the mathematician whether the use of the symbol X to the 22 power involves the 
   "reality" of 22 dimension of space. The Master Therion does not care a scrap 
   of yesterday's newspaper whether he was Marius de Aquila, or whether there ever 
   was such a person, or whether the Universe itself is anything more than a nightmare 
   created by his own imprudence in the matter of rum and water. His memory of 
   Marius de Aquila, of the adventures of that person in Rome and the Black Forest, 
   matters nothing, either to him or to anybody else. What matters is this: True 
   or false, he has found a symbolic form which has enabled him to govern himself 
   to the best advantage. "Quantum nobis prodest hec fabula Christi!" The "falsity" 
   of Aesop's Fables does not diminish their value to mankind. 
 </p><p> The above reduction of the Magical Memory to a device for externalizing one's 
   interior wisdom need not be regarded as sceptical, save only in the last resort. 
   No scientific hypothesis can adduce stronger evidence of its validity than the 
   confirmation of its predictions by experimental evidence. The objective can 
   always be expressed in subjective symbols if necessary. The controversy is ultimately 
   unmeaning. However we interpret the evidence, its relative truth depends in 
   its internal coherence. We may therefore say that any magical recollection is 
   genuine if it gives the explanation of our external or internal conditions. 
   Anything which throws light upon the Universe, anything which reveals us to 
   ourselves, should be welcome in this world of riddles. 
 </p><p> As our record extends into the past, the evidence of its truth is cumulative. 
   Every incarnation that we remember must increase our comprehension of ourselves 
   as we are. Each accession of knowledge must indicate with unmistakable accuracy 
   the solution of some enigma which is propounded by the Sphynx of our own unknown 
   birth-city, Thebes. The complicated situation in which we find ourselves is 
   composed of elements; and no element of it came out of nothing. Newton's First 
   Law applies to every plane of thought. The theory of evolution is omniform. 
   There is a reason for one's predisposition to gout, or the shape of one's ear, 
   in the past. The symbolism may change; the facts do not. In one form or another, 
   everything that exists is derived from some previous manifestation. Have it, 
   if you will, that the memories of other incarnations are dreams; but dreams 
   are determined by reality just as much as the events of the day. The truth is 
   to be apprehended by the correct translation of the symbolic language. The last 
   section of the Oath of the Master of the Temple is: "I swear to interpret every 
   phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with my soul." The Magical Memory 
   is (in the last analysis) one manner, and, as experience testifies, one of the 
   most important manners, of performing this vow.
