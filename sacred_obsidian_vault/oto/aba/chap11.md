   OF OUR LADY BABALON AND OF THE BEAST WHEREON SHE RIDETH.<br>
   ALSO CONCERNING TRANSFORMATIONS.</h2>

 The contents of this section, inasmuch as they concern OUR LADY, are too important 
 and too sacred to be printed. They are only communicated by the Master Therion 
 to chosen pupils in private instruction.

 The essential magical work, apart from any particular operation, is the proper 
 formation of the Magical Being or Body of Light. This process will be discussed 
 at some length in Chapter XVIII. 
 <p> We will here assume that the magician has succeeded in developing his Body 
   of Light until it is able to go anywhere and do anything. There will, however, 
   be a certain limitation to his work, because he has formed his magical body 
   from the fine matter of his own element. Therefore, although he may be able 
   to penetrate the utmost recesses of the heavens, or conduct vigorous combats 
   with the most unpronounceable demons of the pit, it may be impossible for him 
   to do as much as knock a vase from a mantelpiece. His magical body is composed 
   of matter too tenuous to affect directly the gross matter of which illusions 
   such as tables and chairs are made. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The one really easy "physical" operation which the Body of Light 
   can perform is "Congressus subtilis". The emanations of the "Body of Desire" 
   of the material being whom one visits are, if the visit be agreeable, so potent 
   that one spontaneously gains substance in the embrace. There are many cases 
   on record of Children having been born as the result of such unions. See the 
   work of De Sinistrari on Incubi and Succubi for a discussion of analogous phenomena.</em></blockquote>
 There has been a good deal of discussion in the past within the Colleges of the 
 Holy Ghost, as to whether it would be quite legitimate to seek to transcend this 
 limitation. One need not presume to pass judgment. One can leave the decision 
 to the will of each magician. 
 <p> The Book of the Dead contains many chapters intended to enable the magical 
   entity of a man who is dead, and so deprived (according to the theory of death 
   then current) of the material vehicle for executing his will, to take on the 
   form of certain animals, such as a golden hawk or a crocodile, and in such form 
   to go about the earth "taking his pleasure among the living." 
 </p><blockquote><em>See "The Book of Lies" Cap. 44, and The Collected Works of Aleister 
   Crowley, Vol. III, pp. 209-210, where occur paraphrased translations of certain 
   classical Egyptian rituals.</em></blockquote>
 As a general rule, material was supplied out of which he could construct the party 
 of the second part aforesaid, hereinafter referred to as the hawk. 
 <p> We need not, however, consider this question of death. It may often be convenient 
   for the living to go about the world in some such incognito. Now, then, conceive 
   of this magical body as creative force, seeking manifestation; as a God, seeking 
   incarnation. 
 </p><p> There are two ways by which this aim may be effected. The first method is 
   to build up an appropriate body from its elements. This is, generally speaking, 
   a very hard thing to do, because the physical constitution of any material being 
   with much power is, or at least should be, the outcome of ages of evolution. 
   However, there is a lawful method of producing an homunculus which is taught 
   in a certain secret organization, perhaps known to some of those who may read 
   this, which could very readily be adapted to some such purpose as we are now 
   discussing. 
 </p><p> The second method sounds very easy and amusing. You take some organism already 
   existing, which happens to be suitable to your purpose. You drive out the magical 
   being which inhabits it, and take possession. To do this by force is neither 
   easy nor justifiable, because the magical being of the other was incarnated 
   in accordance with its Will. And "... thou hast no right but to do thy will." 
   One should hardly strain this sentence to make one's own will include the will 
   to upset somebody else's will! 
 </p><blockquote><em>Yet it might happen that the Will of the other being was to invite 
   the Magician to indwell its instrument.</em></blockquote>
 Moreover, it is extremely difficult thus to expatriate another magical being; 
 for though, unless it is a complete microcosm like a human being, it cannot be 
 called a star, it is a little bit of a star, and part of the body of Nuit. 
 <p> But there is no call for all this frightfulness. There is no need to knock 
   the girl down, unless she refuses to do what you want, and she will always comply 
   if you say a few nice things to her. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Especially on the subject of the Wand or the Disk.</em></blockquote>
 You can always use the body inhabited by an elemental, such as an eagle, hare, 
 wolf, or any convenient animal, by making a very simple compact. You take over 
 the responsibility for the animal, thus building it up into your own magical hierarchy. 
 This represents a tremendous gain to the animal. 
 <blockquote><em>This is the magical aspect of eating animal food, and its justification, 
   or rather the reconciliation of the apparent contradiction between the carnivorous 
   and humanitarian elements in the nature of "Homo Sapiens".</em></blockquote>
 It completely fulfils its ambition by an alliance of this extremely intimate sort 
 with a Star. The magician, on the other hand, is able to transform and retransform 
 himself in a thousand ways by accepting a retinue of such adherents. In this way 
 the projection of the "astral" or Body of Light may be made absolutely tangible 
 and practical. At the same time, the magician must realise that in undertaking 
 the Karma of any elemental, he is assuming a very serious responsibility. The 
 bond which unites him with that elemental is love; and, though it is only a small 
 part of the outfit of a magician, it is the whole of the outfit of the elemental. 
 He will, therefore, suffer intensely in case of any error or misfortune occurring 
 to his protegee. This feeling is rather peculiar. It is quite instinctive with 
 the best men. They hear of the destruction of a city of a few thousand inhabitants 
 with entire callousness, but then they hear of a dog having hurt its paw, they 
 feel Weltschmertz acutely. 
 <p> It is not necessary to say much more than this concerning transformations. 
   Those to whom the subject naturally appeals will readily understand the importance 
   of what has been said. Those who are otherwise inclined may reflect that a nod 
   is as good as a wink to a blind horse.
