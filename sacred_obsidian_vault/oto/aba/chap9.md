 <h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER IX<br>
   OF SILENCE AND SECRECY:<br>
   AND OF<br>
   THE BARBAROUS NAMES OF EVOCATION.</h2>
 It is found by experience (confirming the statement of Zoroaster) that the most 
 potent conjurations are those in an ancient and perhaps forgotten language, or 
 even those couched in a corrupt and possibly always meaningless jargon. Of these 
 there are several main types. The "preliminary invocation" in the "Goetia" consists 
 principally of corruptions of Greek and Egyptian names. For example, we find "Osorronnophris" 
 for "Asor Un-Nefer".
 <blockquote><em>See appendix 4, Liber Samekh; this is an edition of this Invocation, 
   with an elaborate Rubric, translation, scholia, and instruction.
   <p> {WEH ADDENDUM: This is the "Preliminary Invocation" placed in the "Goetia" 
     in the Mathers transcription (Not "translation") by Crowley. This invocation 
     is not a part of the original text, but comes to us from the Greco-Egyptian 
     period of perhaps the 6th century. The Goetia is itself a small portion of 
     the "Lemegeton" or "Lesser Key of Solomon." This "Preliminary Evocation" is 
     altered in Liber Samekh over that published in the "Goetia".
   </p></em></blockquote>
 The conjurations given by Dr. Dee (vide Equinox I, VIII) are in a language called 
 Angelic, or Enochian. Its source has hitherto baffled research, but it is a language 
 and not a jargon, for it possesses a structure of its own, and there are traces 
 of grammar and syntax.
 <p> However this may be, it "works". Even the beginner finds that "things happen" 
   when he uses it: and this is an advantage --- or disadvantage! ---- shared by 
   no other type of language,. The rest need skill. This needs Prudence!
 </p><p> The Egyptian Invocations are much purer, but their meaning has not been sufficiently 
   studied by persons magically competent. We possess a number of Invocations in 
   Greek of every degree of excellence; in Latin but few, and those of inferior 
   quality. It will be noticed that in every case the conjurations are very sonorous, 
   and there is a certain magical voice in which they should be recited. This special 
   voice was a natural gift of the Master Therion; but it can be easily taught 
   --- to the right people. 
 </p><p> Various considerations impelled Him to attempt conjurations in the English 
   language. There already existed one example, the charm of the witches in Macbeth; 
   although this was perhaps not meant seriously, its effect is indubitable. 
 </p><blockquote><em>A true poet cannot help revealing himself and the truth of things 
   in his art, whether he be aware of what he is writing, or no.</em></blockquote>
 He has found iambic tetrameters enriched with many rimes both internal an external 
 very useful. "The Wizard Way" (Equinox I,I) gives a good idea of the sort of thing. 
 So does the Evocation of Bartzabel in Equinox I,IX. There are many extant invocations 
 throughout his works, in many kinds of metre, of many kinds of being, and for 
 many kinds of purposes. (See Appendix). 
 <p> Other methods of incantation are on record as efficacious. For instance Frater 
   I.A., when a child, was told that he could invoke the devil by repeating the 
   "Lord's Prayer" backwards. He went into the garden and did so. The Devil appeared, 
   and almost scared him out of his life. 
 </p><p> It is therefore not quite certain in what the efficacy of conjurations really 
   lies. The peculiar mental excitement required may even be aroused by the perception 
   of the absurdity of the process, and the persistence in it, as when once FRATER 
   PERDURABO (at the end of His magical resources) recited "From Greenland's Icy 
   Mountains", and obtained His result. 
 </p><blockquote><em>See "Eleusis", A. Crowley, "Collected Works", Vol. III Epilogue.</em></blockquote>
 It may be conceded in any case that the long strings of formidable words which 
 roar and moan through so many conjurations have a real effect in exalting the 
 consciousness of the magician to the proper pitch --- that they should do so is 
 no more extraordinary than music of any kind should do so. 
 <p> Magicians have not confined themselves to the use of the human voice. The 
   Pan-pipe with its seven stops, corresponding to the seven planets, the bull-roarer, 
   the tom-tom, and even the violin, have all been used, as well as many others, 
   of which the most important is the bell 
 </p><blockquote><em>See Part II. It should be said that in experience no bell save 
   His own Tibetan bell of Electrum Magicum has ever sounded satisfactory to the 
   Master Therion. Most bells jar and repel.</em></blockquote>
 , though this is used not so much for actual conjuration as to mark stages in 
 the ceremony. Of all these the tom-tom will be found to be the most generally 
 useful. 
 <p> While on the subject of barbarous names of evocation we should not omit the 
   utterance of certain supreme words which enshrine (alpha) the complete formula 
   of the God invoked, or (beta) the whole ceremony. 
 </p><p> Examples of the former kind are Tetragrammaton, I.A.O., and Abrahadabra. 
 </p><p> An example of the latter kind is the great word StiBeTTChePhMeFSHiSS, which 
   is a line drawn on the Tree of Life (Coptic attributions) in a certain manner. 
 </p><blockquote><em>It represents the descent of a certain Influence. See the Evocation 
   of Taphtatharath, Equinox I, III. The attributions are given in 777. This Word 
   expresses the current Kether - Beth - Binah - Cheth - Geburach - Mem - Hod - 
   Shin - Malkuth, the descent from 1 to 10 via the Pillar of Severity.</em></blockquote>
 With all such words it is of the utmost importance that they should never be spoken 
 until the supreme moment, and even then they should burst from the magician almost 
 despite himself --- so great should be his reluctance 
 <blockquote><em>This reluctance is Freudian, due to the power of these words to 
   awaken the suppressed subconscious libido.</em></blockquote>
 to utter them. In fact, they should be the utterance of the God in him at the 
 first onset of the divine possession. So uttered, they cannot fail of effect, 
 for they have become the effect. 
 <p> Every wise magician will have constructed (according to the principles of 
   the Holy Qabalah) many such words, and he should have quintessentialised them 
   all in one Word, which last Word, once he has formed it, he should never utter 
   consciously even in thought, until perhaps with it he gives up the ghost. Such 
   a Word should in fact be so potent that man cannot hear it and live. 
 </p><p> Such a word was indeed the lost Tetragrammaton 
 </p><blockquote><em>The Master Therion has received this Word; it is communicated 
   by Him to the proper postulants, at the proper time and place, in the proper 
   circumstances.</em></blockquote>
 . It is said that at the utterance of this name the Universe crashes into dissolution. 
 Let the Magician earnestly seek this Lost Word, for its pronunciation is synonymous 
 with the accomplishment of the Great Work. 
 <blockquote><em>Each man has a different Great Work, just as no two points on 
   the circumference of a circle are connected with the centre by the same radius. 
   The Word will be correspondingly unique.</em></blockquote>
 In this matter of the efficacity of words there are again two formulae exactly 
 opposite in nature. A word may become potent and terrible by virtue of constant 
 repetition. It is in this way that most religions gain strength. At first the 
 statement "So and so is God" excites no interest. Continue, and you meet scorn 
 and scepticism: possibly persecution. Continue, and the controversy has so far 
 died out that no one troubles to contradict your assertion. 
 <p> No superstition is so dangerous and so lively as an exploded superstition. 
   The newspapers of to-day (written and edited almost exclusively by men without 
   a spark of either religion or morality) dare not hint that any one disbelieves 
   in the ostensibly prevailing cult; they deplore Atheism --- all but universal 
   in practice and implicit in the theory of practically all intelligent people 
   --- as if it were the eccentricity of a few negligible or objectionable persons. 
   This is the ordinary story of advertisement; the sham has exactly the same chance 
   as the real. Persistence is the only quality required for success. 
 </p><p> The opposite formula is that of secrecy. An idea is perpetuated because it 
   must never be mentioned. A freemason never forgets the secret words entrusted 
   to him, thought these words mean absolutely nothing to him, in the vast majority 
   of cases; the only reason for this is that he has been forbidden to mention 
   them, although they have been published again and again, and are as accessible 
   to the profane as to the initiate. 
 </p><p> In such a work of practical Magick as the preaching of a new Law, these methods 
   may be advantageously combined; on the one hand infinite frankness and readiness 
   to communicate all secrets; on the other the sublime and terrible knowledge 
   that all real secrets are incommunicable. 
 </p><blockquote><em>If this were not the case, individuality would not be inviolable. 
   No man can communicate even the simplest thought to any other man in any full 
   and accurate sense. For that thought is sown in a different soil, and cannot 
   produce an identical effect. I cannot put a spot of red upon two pictures without 
   altering each in diverse ways. It might have little effect on a sunset by Turner, 
   but much on a nocturne by Whistler. The identity of the two spots as spots would 
   thus be fallacious.</em></blockquote>
 It is, according to tradition, a certain advantage in conjurations to employ more 
 than one language. In all probability the reason of this is than any change spurs 
 the flagging attention. A man engaged in intense mental labour will frequently 
 stop and walk up and down the room --- one may suppose for this cause --- but 
 it is a sign of weakness that this should be necessary. For the beginner in Magick, 
 however, it is permissible 
 <blockquote><em>This is not to say that it is advisable. O how shameful is human 
   weakness! But it does encourage one --- it is useless to deny it --- to be knocked 
   down by a Demon of whose existence one was not really quite sure.</em></blockquote>
 to employ any device to secure the result. 
 <p> Conjurations should be recited, not read: 
 </p><blockquote><em>Even this is for the weaker brethern. The really great Magus speaks 
   and acts impromptu and extempore.</em></blockquote>
 and the entire ceremony should be so perfectly performed that one is hardly conscious 
 of any effort of memory. The ceremony should be constructed with such logical 
 fatality that a mistake is impossible. 
 <blockquote><em>First-rate poetry is easily memorized because the ideas and the 
   musical values correspond to man's mental and sensory structure.</em></blockquote>
 The conscious ego of the Magician is to be destroyed to be absorbed in that of 
 the God whom he invokes, and the process should not interfere with the automation 
 who is performing the ceremony. 
 <p> But this ego of which it is here spoken is the true ultimate ego. The automaton 
   should possess will, energy, intelligence, reason, and resource. This automaton 
   should be the perfect man far more than any other man can be. It is only the 
   divine self within the man, a self as far above the possession of will or any 
   other qualities whatsoever as the heavens are high above the earth, that should 
   reabsorb itself into that illimitable radiance of which it is a spark. 
 </p><blockquote><em>This is said of the partial or lesser Works of Magick. This is 
   an elementary treatise; one cannot discuss higher Works as for example those 
   of "The Hermit of Aesopus Island".</em></blockquote>
 The great difficulty for the single Magician is so to perfect himself that these 
 multifarious duties of the Ritual are adequately performed. At first he will find 
 that the exaltation destroys memory and paralyses muscle. This is an essential 
 difficulty of the magical process, and can only be overcome by practice and experience. 
 <blockquote><em>See "The Book of Lies"; there are several chapters on this subject. 
   But Right exaltation should produce spontaneously the proper mental and physical 
   reactions. As soon as the development is secured, there will be automatic reflex 
   "justesse", exactly as in normal affairs mind and body respond with free unconscious 
   rightness to the Will.</em></blockquote>
 In order to aid concentration, and to increase the supply of Energy, it has been 
 customary for the Magician to employ assistants or colleagues. It is doubtful 
 whether the obvious advantages of this plan compensate the difficulty of procuring 
 suitable persons 
 <blockquote><em>The organic development of Magick in the world due to the creative 
   Will of the Master Therion makes it with every year that passes easier to find 
   scientifically trained co-workers.</em></blockquote>
 , and the chance of a conflict of will or a misunderstanding in the circle itself. 
 On one occasion FRATER PERDURABO was disobeyed by an assistant, and had it not 
 been for His promptitude in using the physical compulsion of the sword, it is 
 probable that the circle would have been broken. As it was, the affair fortunately 
 terminated in nothing more serious than the destruction of the culprit. 
 <p> However, there is no doubt that an assemblage of persons who really are in 
   harmony can much more easily produce an effect than a magician working by himself. 
   The psychology of "Revival meetings" will be familiar to almost every one, and 
   though such meetings 
 </p><blockquote><em>See, for an account of properly-conducted congregational ceremonial, 
   Equinox I, IX. "Energized Enthusiasm", and Equinox III, L. Liber XV, Ecclesiae 
   Gnosticae Catholicae Cannon Missae. The "Revival meetings" here in question 
   were deliberate exploitations of religious hysteria.</em></blockquote>
 are the foulest and most degraded rituals of black magic, the laws of Magick are 
 not thereby suspended. The laws of Magick are the laws of Nature. 
 <p> A singular and world-famous example of this is of sufficiently recent date 
   to be fresh in the memory of many people now living. At a nigger camp meeting 
   in the "United" States of America, devotees were worked up to such a pitch of 
   excitement that the whole assembly developed a furious form of hysteria. The 
   comparatively intelligible cries of "Glory" and "Hallelujah" no longer expressed 
   the situation. Somebody screamed out "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay!", and this was taken 
   up by the whole meeting and yelled continuously, until reaction set in. The 
   affair got into the papers, and some particularly bright disciple of John Stuart 
   Mill, logician and economist, thought that these words, having set one set of 
   fools crazy, might do the same to all the other fools in the world. He accordingly 
   wrote a song, and produced the desired result. This is the most notorious example 
   of recent times of the power exerted by a barbarous name of evocation. 
 </p><p> A few words may be useful to reconcile the general notion of Causality with 
   that of Magick. How can we be sure that a person waving a stick and howling 
   thereby produces thunderstorms? In no other way than that familiar to Science; 
   we note that whenever we put a lighted match to dry gunpowder, an unintelligibly 
   arbitrary phenomenon, that of sound, is observed; and so forth. 
 </p><p> We need not dwell upon this point; but it seems worth while to answer one 
   of the objections to the possibility of Magick, chosing one which is at first 
   sight of an obviously "fatal" character. It is convenient to quote verbatim 
   from the Diary 
 </p><blockquote><em>In a later entry we read that the diarist has found a similar 
   train of argument in "Space, Time, and Gravitation", page 51. He was much encourage 
   by the confirmation of his thesis in so independent a system of thought.</em></blockquote>
 of a distinguished Magician and philosopher. "I have noticed that the effect of 
 a Magical Work has followed it so closely that it must have been started before 
 the time of the Work. E.g. I work to-night to make X in Paris write to me. I get 
 the letter the next morning, so that it must have been written before the Work. 
 Does this deny that the Work caused the effect? 
 <p> "If I strike a billiard-ball and it moves, both my will and its motion are 
   due to causes long antecedent to the act. I may consider both my Work and its 
   reaction as twin effects of the eternal Universe. The moved arm and ball are 
   parts of a state of the Cosmos which resulted necessarily from its momentarily 
   previous state, and so, back for ever. "Thus, my Magical Work is only one of 
   the cause-effects necessarily concomitant with the case-effects which set the 
   ball in motion. I may therefore regard the act of striking as a cause-effect 
   of my original Will to move the ball, though necessarily previous to its motion. 
   But the case of magical Work is not quite analogous. For my nature is such that 
   I am compelled to perform Magick in order to make my will to prevail; so that 
   the cause of my doing the Work is also the cause of the ball's motion, and there 
   is no reason why one should precede the other. (CF. "Lewis Carroll," where the 
   Red Queen screams before she pricks her finger.) 
 </p><p> "Let me illustrate the theory by an actual example. 
 </p><p> "I write from Italy to a man in France and another in Australia on the same 
   day, telling them to join me. Both arrive ten days later; the first in answer 
   to my letter, which he received, the second on "his own initiative", as it would 
   seem. But I summoned him because I wanted him; and I wanted him because he was 
   my representative; and his intelligence made him resolve to join me because 
   it judged rightly that the situation (so far as he knew it) was such as to make 
   me desire his presence. 
 </p><p> "The same cause, therefore, which made me write to him made him come to me; 
   and though it would be improper to say that the writing of the letter was the 
   direct cause of his arrival, it is evident that if I had not written I should 
   have been different from what I actually am, and therefore my relations with 
   him would have been otherwise than they are. In this sense, therefore, the letter 
   and the journey are causally connected. 
 </p><p> "One cannot go farther, and say that in this case I ought to write the letter 
   even if he had arrived before I did so; for it is part of the whole set of circumstance 
   that I do not use a crowbar on an open door. "The conclusion is that one should 
   do one's Will 'without lust of result'. If one is working in accordance with 
   the laws of one's own nature, one is doing 'right'; and no such work can be 
   criticised as 'useless', even in cases of the character here discussed. So long 
   as one's Will prevails, there is no cause for complaint. 
 </p><p> "To abandon one's Magick would shew lack of self-confidence in one's powers, 
   and doubt as to one's inmost faith in Self and in Nature. 
 </p><blockquote><em>i.e. on the ground that one cannot understand how Magick can produce 
   the desired effects. For if one possesses the inclination to do Magick, it is 
   evidence of a tendency in one's Nature. Nobody understands fully how the mind 
   moves the muscles; but we know that lack of confidence on this point means paralysis. 
   "If the Sun and Moon should doubt, They'd immediately go out", as Blake said. 
   Also, as I said myself. "Who hath the How is careless of the Why".</em></blockquote>
 Of course one changes one's methods as experience indicates; but there is no need 
 to change them on any such ground as the above. 
 <p> "Further, the argument here set forth disposes of the need to explain the 
   "modus operandi" of Magick. A successful operation does not involve any theory 
   soever, not even that of the existence of causality itself. The whole set of 
   phenomena may be conceived as single. 
 </p><p> "For instance, if I see a star (as it was years ago) I need not assume causal 
   relations as existing between it, the earth, and myself. The connexion exists; 
   I can predicate nothing beyond that. I cannot postulate purpose, or even determine 
   the manner in which the event comes to be. Similarly, when I do Magick, it is 
   in vain to inquire why I so act, or why the desired result does or does not 
   follow. Nor can I know how the previous and subsequent conditions are connected. 
   At most I can describe the consciousness which I interpret as a picture of the 
   facts, and make empirical generalizations of the superficial aspects of the 
   case. 
 </p><p> "Thus, I have my own personal impressions of the act of telephoning; but I 
   cannot be aware of what consciousness, electricity, mechanics, sound, etc., 
   actually are in themselves. And although I can appeal to experience to lay down 
   'laws' as to what conditions accompany the act, I can never be sure that they 
   have always been, or ever will again be, identical. (In fact, it is certain 
   that an event can never occur twice in precisely the same circumstances.) 
 </p><blockquote><em>If it did so, how could we call it duplex?</em></blockquote>
 "Further, my 'laws; must always take nearly all the more important elements of 
 knowledge for granted. I cannot say --- finally --- how an electric current is 
 generated. I cannot be sure that some totally unsuspected force is not at work 
 in some entirely arbitrary way. For example, it was formerly supposed that Hydrogen 
 and Chlorine would unite when an electric spark was passed through the mixture; 
 now we 'know' that the presence of a minute quantity of aqueous vapour (or some 
 tertium quid) is essential to the reaction. We formulated before the days of Ross 
 the 'laws' of malarial fever, without reference to the mosquito; we might discover 
 one day that the germ is only active when certain events are transpiring in some 
 nebula 
 <blockquote><em>The history of the Earth is included in the period of some such 
   relation; so that we cannot possibly be sure that we may deny: "Malarial fever 
   is a function of the present precession of the Equinoxes".</em></blockquote>
 , or when so apparently inert a substance as Argon is present in the air in certain 
 proportions. 
 <p> "We may therefore admit quite cheerfully that Magick is as mysterious as mathematics, 
   as empirical as poetry, as uncertain as golf, and as dependent on the personal 
   equation as Love. 
 </p><p> "That is no reason why we should not study, practice and enjoy it; for it 
   is a Science in exactly the same sense as biology; it is no less an Art that 
   Sculpture; and it is a Sport as much as Mountaineering. 
 </p><p> "Indeed, there seems to be no undue presumption in urging that no Science 
   possesses equal possibilities of deep and important Knowledge; 
 </p><blockquote><em>Magick is less liable to lead to error than any other Science, 
   because its terms are interchangeable, by definition, so that it is based on 
   relativity from the start. We run no risk of asserting absolute propositions. 
   Furthermore we make our measurements in terms of the object measured, thus avoiding 
   the absurdity of defining metaphysical ideas by mutable standards, (Cf. Eddington 
   "Space, Time, and Gravitation". Prologue.) of being forced to attribute the 
   qualities of human consciousness to inanimate things (Poincare, "La mesure du 
   temps"), and of asserting that we know anything of the universe in itself, though 
   the nature of our senses and our minds necessarily determines our observations, 
   so that the limit of our knowledge is subjective, just as a thermometer can 
   record nothing but its own reaction to one particular type of Energy. 
   <p> Magick recognizes frankly (1) that truth is relative, subjective, and apparent; 
     (2) that Truth implies Omniscience, which is unattainable by mind, being transfinite; 
     just as if one tried to make an exact map of England in England, that map 
     must contain a map of the map, and so on, ad infinitum; (3) that logical contradiction 
     is inherent in reason, (Russell, "Introduction to Mathematical Philosophy", 
     p. 136; Crowley, "Eleusis", and elsewhere); (4) that a Continuum requires 
     a Continuum to be commensurable with it: (5) that Empiricism is ineluctable, 
     and therefore that adjustment is the only possible method of action; and (6) 
     that error may be avoided by opposing no resistance to change, and registering 
     observed phenomena in their own language. 
   </p></em></blockquote>
 that no Art offers such opportunities to the ambition of the Soul to express its 
 Truth, in Ecstasy, through Beauty; and that no Sport rivals its fascinations of 
 danger and delight, so excites, exercises, and tests its devotees to the uttermost, 
 or so rewards them by well-being, pride, and the passionate pleasures of personal 
 triumph. 
 <p> "Magick takes every thought and act for its apparatus; it has the Universe 
   for its Library and its Laboratory; all Nature is its Subject; and its Game, 
   free from close seasons and protective restrictions, always abounds in infinite 
   variety, being all that exists. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The elasticity of Magick makes it equal to all possible kinds 
   of environment, and therefore biologically perfect. "Do what thou wilt..." implies 
   self-adjustment, so that failure cannot occur. One's true Will is necessarily 
   fitted to the whole Universe with the utmost exactitude, because each term in 
   the equation a+b+c=0 must be equal and opposite to the sum of all the other 
   terms. No individual can ever be aught than himself, or do aught else than his 
   Will, which is his necessary relation with his environment, dynamically considered. 
   All error is no more than an illusion proper to him to dissipate the mirage, 
   and it is a general law that the method of accomplishing this operation is to 
   realize, and to acquiesce in, the order of the Universe, and to refrain from 
   attempting the impossible task of overcoming the inertia of the forces which 
   oppose, and therefore are identical with, one's self. Error in thought is therefore 
   failure to understand, and in action to perform, one's own true Will.</em></blockquote>
