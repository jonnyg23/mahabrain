 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <em>Esseai athanatos theos, ambrotos, oyk eti thnétos</em><br>
 <cite>Pythagoras.</cite> 
 <p> "Magic is the Highest, most Absolute, and most Divine Knowledge of Natural 
   Philosophy, advanced in its works and wonderful operations by a right understanding 
   of the inward and occult virtue of things; so that true Agents being applied 
   to proper Patients, strange and admirable effects will thereby be produced. 
   Whence magicians are profound and diligent searchers into Nature; they, because 
   of their skill, know how to anticipate an effect, the which to the vulgar shall 
   seem to be a miracle."<br>
   <cite>The Goetia of the Lemegeton of King Solomon.</cite> 
 </p><p> "Wherever sympathetic magic occurs in its pure unadulterated form, it is assumed 
   that in nature one event follows another necessarily and invariably without 
   the intervention of any spiritual or personal agency. 
 </p><p> <strong>Thus its fundamental conception is identical with that of modern science; 
   underlying the whole system is a faith, implicit but real and firm, in the order 
   and uniformity of nature.</strong> The magician does not doubt that the same 
   causes will always produce the same effects, that the performance of the proper 
   ceremony accompanied by the appropriate spell, will inevitably be attended by 
   the desired results, unless, indeed, his incantations should chance to be thwarted 
   and foiled by the more potent charms of another sorcerer. He supplicates no 
   higher power: he sues the favour of no fickle and wayward being: he abases himself 
   before no awful deity. Yet his power, great as he believes it to be, is by no 
   means arbitrary and unlimited. He can wield it only so long as he strictly conforms 
   to the rules of his art, or to what may be called the laws of nature as conceived 
   by him. To neglect these rules, to break these laws in the smallest particular 
   is to incur failure, and may even expose the unskilful practitioner himself 
   to the utmost peril. If he claims a sovereignty over nature, it is a constitutional 
   sovereignty rigorously limited in its scope and exercised in exact conformity 
   with ancient usage. Thus the analogy between the magical and the scientific 
   conceptions of the world is close. In both of them the succession of events 
   is perfectly regular and certain, being determined by immutable laws, the operation 
   of which can be foreseen and calculated precisely; the elements of caprice, 
   of chance, and of accident are banished from the course of nature. Both of them 
   open up a seemingly boundless vista of possibilities to him who knows the causes 
   of things and can touch the secret springs that set in motion the vast and intricate 
   mechanism of the world. Hence the strong attraction which magic and science 
   alike have exercised on the human mind; hence the powerful stimulus that both 
   have given to the pursuit of knowledge. They lure the weary enquirer, the footsore 
   seeker, on through the wilderness of disappointment in the present by their 
   endless promises of the future: they take him up to he top of an exceeding high 
   mountain and shew him, beyond the dark clouds and rolling mists at his feet, 
   a vision of the celestial city, far off, it may be, but radiant with unearthly 
   splendour, bathed in the light of dreams."<br>
   Dr. J. G. FRAZER, <cite>"The Golden Bough".</cite> 
 </p><p> "So far, therefore, <strong>as the public profession of magic has been one 
   of the roads by which men have passed to supreme power, it has contributed to 
   emancipate mankind from the thraldom of tradition and to elevate them into a 
   larger, freer life, with a broader outlook on the world. This is no small service 
   rendered to humanity.</strong> And when we remember further that in another 
   direction magic has paved the way for science, we are forced to admit that if 
   the black art has done much evil, it has also been the source of much good; 
   that if it is the child of error, <strong>it has yet been the mother of freedom 
   and truth.</strong>"<br>

   LIBER AL vel xxxi: The Book of the Law. 
 </p><hr>
 This book is for<br>
 <strong> ALL:</strong><br>
 for every man, woman, and child.<br>
 My former work has been misunderstood, and its scope limited, by my use of technical 
 terms. It has attracted only too many dilettanti and eccentrics, weaklings seeking 
 in "Magic" an escape from reality. I myself was first consciously drawn to the 
 subject in this way. And it has repelled only too many scientific and practical 
 minds, such as I most designed to influence.<br>
 But<br>
 <strong> MAGICK</strong><br>
 is for<br>
 <strong> ALL.</strong><br>
 I have written this book to help the Banker, the Pugilist, the Biologist, the 
 Poet, the Navvy, the Grocer, the Factory Girl, the Mathematician, the Stenographer, 
 the Golfer, the Wife, the Consul --- and all the rest --- to fulfil themselves 
 perfectly, each in his or her own proper function.<br>
 Let me explain in a few words how it came about that I blazoned the word<br>
 <strong> MAGICK</strong><br>
 upon the Banner that I have borne before me all my life.<br>
 Before I touched my teens, I was already aware that I was THE BEAST whose number 
 is 666. I did not understand in the least {XI} what that implied; it was a passionately 
 ecstatic sense of identity.<br>
 In my third year at Cambridge, I devoted myself consciously to the Great Work, 
 understanding thereby the Work of becoming a Spiritual Being, free from the constraints, 
 accidents, and deceptions of material existence.<br>
 I found myself at a loss for a name to designate my work, just as H. P. Blavatsky 
 some years earlier. "Theosophy", "Spiritualism", "Occultism", "Mysticism", all 
 involved undesirable connotations.<br>
 I chose therefore the name.<br>
 <strong> "MAGICK"</strong><br>
 as essentially the most sublime, and actually the most discredited, of all the 
 available terms.<br>
 I swore to rehabilitate<br>
 <strong> MAGICK,</strong><br>
 to identify it with my own career; and to compel mankind to respect, love, and 
 trust that which they scorned, hated and feared. I have kept my Word.<br>
 But the time is now come for me to carry my banner into the thick of the press 
 of human life.<br>
 I must make<br>
 <strong> MAGICK</strong><br>
 the essential factor in the life of<br>
 <strong> ALL.</strong><br>
 In presenting this book to the world, I must then explain and justify my position 
 by formulating a definition of<br>
 <strong> MAGICK</strong><br>
 and setting forth its main principles in such a way that<br>
 <strong> ALL</strong><br>
 may understand instantly that their souls, their lives, in every relation with 
 every other human being and every circumstance, depend upon<br>
 <strong> MAGICK</strong><br>
 and the right comprehension and right application thereof. 
 <p> I) <em><a name="Definition">DEFINITION.</a></em> 
 </p><p> <strong>Magick is the Science and Art of causing Change to occur in conformity 
   with Will.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: It is my Will to inform the World of certain facts within my 
   knowledge. I therefore take "magickal weapons", pen, ink, and paper; I write 
   "incantations"---these sentences---in the "magickal language" ie, that which 
   is understood by the people I wish to instruct; I call forth "spirits", such 
   as printers, publishers, booksellers and so forth and constrain them to convey 
   my message to those people. The composition and distribution of this book is 
   thus an act of Magick by which I cause Changes to take place in conformity with 
   my Will.) 
 </p><blockquote><em>In one sense Magick may be defined as the name given to Science 
   by the vulgar.</em></blockquote>
 II) <em>POSTULATE.</em> 
 <p> <strong>ANY required change may be effected by the application of the proper 
   kind and degree of Force in the proper manner, through the proper medium to 
   the proper object.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: I wish to prepare an ounce of Chloride of Gold. I must take 
   the right kind of acid, nitro-hydrochloric and no other, in a vessel which will 
   not break, leak or corrode, in such a manner as will not produce undesirable 
   results, with the necessary quantity of Gold: and so forth. Every change has 
   its own conditions. 
 </p><p> In the present state of our knowledge and power some changes are not possible 
   in practice; we cannot cause eclipses, for instance, or transform lead into 
   tin, or create men from mushrooms. But it is theoretically possible to cause 
   in any object any change of which that object is capable by nature; and the 
   conditions are covered by the above postulate.) 
 </p><p> III) <em>THEOREMS.</em> 
 </p><p> <strong>1) Every intentional act is a Magickal act.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: See "Definition" above.) 
 </p><blockquote><em>By "intentional" I mean "willed". But even unintentional acts 
   so seeming are not truly so. Thus, breathing is an act of the Will to Live.</em></blockquote>
 <strong>2) Every successful act has conformed to the postulate.</strong> 
 <p> <strong>3) Every failure proves that one or more requirements of the postulate 
   have not been fulfilled.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustrations: There may be failure to understand the case, as when a doctor 
   makes a wrong diagnosis, and his treatment injures the patient. There may be 
   a failure to apply the right kind of force, as when a rustic tries to blow out 
   an electric light. There may be failure to apply the right degree of force, 
   as when a wrestler has his hold broken, There may be failure to apply the force 
   in the right manner, as when one presents a cheque at the wrong window of the 
   Bank. There may be failure to employ the correct medium, as when Leonardo da 
   Vinci saw his masterpiece fade away. The force may be applied to an unsuitable 
   object, as when one tries to crack a stone, thinking it a nut.) 
 </p><p> <strong>4) The first requisite for causing any change is thorough qualitative 
   and quantitative understanding of the conditions.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: The most common cause of failure in life is ignorance of one's 
   own True Will, or of the means to fulfill that Will. A man may fancy himself 
   a painter, and waste his life trying to become one; or he may really be a painter, 
   and yet fail to understand and to measure the difficulties peculiar to that 
   career.) 
 </p><p> <strong>5) The second requisite of causing any change is the practical ability 
   to set in right motion the necessary forces.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: A banker may have a perfect grasp of a given situation, yet 
   lack the quality of decision, or the assets, necessary to take advantage of 
   it.) 
 </p><p> <strong>6) "Every man and every woman is a star".</strong> That is to say, 
   every human being is intrinsically an independent individual with his own proper 
   character and proper motion. 
 </p><p> <strong>7) Every man and every woman has a course, depending partly on the 
   self, and partly on the environment which is natural and necessary for each. 
   Anyone who is forced from his own course, either through not understanding himself, 
   or through external opposition, comes into conflict with the order of the Universe, 
   and suffers accordingly.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: A man may think it is his duty to act in a certain way, through 
   having made a fancy picture of himself, instead of investigating his actual 
   nature. For example, a woman may make herself miserable for life by thinking 
   that she prefers love to social consideration, or vice versa. One woman may 
   stay with an unsympathetic husband when she would really be happy in an attic 
   with a lover, while another may fool herself into a romantic elopement when 
   her only pleasures are those of presiding over fashionable functions. Again, 
   a boy's instinct may tell him to go to sea, while his parents insist on his 
   becoming a doctor. In such a case he will be both unsuccessful and unhappy in 
   medicine.) 
 </p><p> <strong>8) A Man whose conscious will is at odds with his True Will is wasting 
   his strength. He cannot hope to influence his environment efficiently.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: When Civil War rages in a nation, it is in no condition to 
   undertake the invasion of other countries. A man with cancer employs his nourishment 
   alike to his own use and to that of the enemy which is part of himself. He soon 
   fails to resist the pressure of his environment. In practical life, a man who 
   is doing what his conscience tells him to be wrong will do it very clumsily. 
   At first!) 
 </p><p> <strong>9) A Man who is doing his True Will has the inertia of the Universe 
   to assist him.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: The first principle of success in evolution is that the individual 
   should be true to his own nature, and at the same time adapt himself to his 
   environment.) 
 </p><p> <strong>10) Nature is a continuous phenomenon, though we may not know in all 
   cases how things are connected.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: Human comsciousness depends on the properties of protoplasm, 
   the existence of which depends on innumerable physical conditions peculiar to 
   this planet; and this planet is determined by the mechanical balance of the 
   whole universe of matter. We may then say that our consciousness is causally 
   connected with the remotest galaxies; yet we do not even know how it arises 
   from--or with--the molecular changes in the brain.) 
 </p><p> <strong>11) Science enables us to take advantage of the continuity of Nature 
   by the empirical application of certain principles whose interplay involves 
   different orders of idea connected with each other in a way beyond our present 
   comprehension.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: We are able to light cities by rule-of-thumb methods. We do 
   not know what consciousness is, or how it is connected with muscular action; 
   what electricity is or how it is connected with the machines that generate it; 
   and our methods depend on calculations involving mathematical ideas which have 
   no correspondance in the Universe as we know it.) 
 </p><blockquote><em> For instance "irrational", "unreal" and "infinite" expressions.</em></blockquote>
 <strong>12) Man is ignorant of the nature of his own being and powers. Even his 
 idea of his limitations is based on experience of the past, and every step in 
 his progress extends his empire. There is therefore no reason to assign theoretical 
 limits</strong> 
 <blockquote><em> note: i.e., except---possibly---in the case of logically absurd 
   questions such as the Schoolmen discussed in connection with "God".</em></blockquote>
 <strong>to what he may be, or what he may do.</strong> 
 <p> (Illustration: A generation ago it was supposed theoretically impossible that 
   man should ever know the composition of the fixed stars. It is known that our 
   senses are adapted to receive only a fraction of the possible rates of vibration.Modern 
   instruments have enabled us to detect some of these supra-sensibles by indirect 
   methods, and even to use their peculiar qualities in the service of man, as 
   in the case of the rays of Hertz and Roentgen. As Tyndall said, man might at 
   any moment learn to percieve and utilize vibrations of all concievable and inconcievable 
   kinds. The question of Magick is a question of discovering and employing hitherto 
   unknown forces in nature. We know that they exist, and we cannot doubt the possibility 
   of mental or physical instruments capable of bringing us into relation with 
   them.) 
 </p><p> <strong>13) Every man is more or less aware that his individuality comprises 
   several orders of existence, even when he maintains that his subtler principles 
   are merely symptomatic of the changes in his gross vehicle. A similar order 
   may be assumed to extend throughout nature.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: One does not confuse the pain of a toothache with the decay 
   that causes it. Inanimate objects are sensitive to certain physical forces, 
   such as electrical and thermal conductivity; but neither in us nor in them--so 
   far as we know--is there any direct conscious perception of these forces. Imperceptible 
   influences are therefore associated with all material phenomena; and there is 
   no reason why we should not work upon matter through these subtle energies as 
   we do through their material bases. In fact, we use magnetic force to move iron 
   and solar radiation to reproduce images.) 
 </p><p> <strong>14) Man is capable of being, and using, anything which he perceives, 
   for everything which he perceives is in a certain sense a part of his being. 
   He may thus subjugate the whole of the Universe of which he is conscious to 
   his individual Will.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: Man has used the idea of God to dictate his personal conduct, 
   to obtain power over his fellows, to excuse his crimes, and for innumerable 
   other purposes, including that of realizing himself as God. He has used the 
   irrational and unreal conceptions of mathematics to help him in the construction 
   of mechanical devices. He has used his moral force to influence the actions 
   even of wild animals. He has employed poetic genius for political purposes.) 
 </p><p> <strong>15) Every force in the Universe is capable of being transformed into 
   any other kind of force by using suitable means. There is thus an inexhaustible 
   supply of any particular kind of force that we may need.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: Heat may be transformed into light and power by using it to 
   drive dynamos. The vibrations of the air may be used to kill men by so ordering 
   them in speech so as to inflame war-like passions. The hallucinations connected 
   with the mysterious energies of sex result in the perpetuation of the species.) 
 </p><p> <strong>16) The application of any given force affects all the orders of being 
   which exist in the object in the object to which it is applied, whichever of 
   of those orders is directly affected.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: If I strike a man with a dagger, his consciousness, not his 
   body only, is affected by my act, although the dagger, as such, has no direct 
   relation therewith. Similarly, the power of my thought may so work on the mind 
   of another person as to produce far-reaching physical changes in him, or in 
   others through him.) 
 </p><p> <strong>17) A man may learn to use any force so as to serve any purpose, by 
   taking advantage of the above theorems.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: A man may use a razor to make himself vigilant over his speech, 
   by using it to cut himself whenever he ungaurdedly utters a chosen word. He 
   may serve the same purpose by resolving that every incident of his life shall 
   remind him of a particular thing, making every impression the starting point 
   of a connected series of thoughts ending in that thing. He might also devote 
   his whole energies to some one particular object, by resolving to do nothing 
   at variance therewith, and to make every act turn to the advantage of that object.) 
 </p><p> <strong>18) He may attract to himself any force of the Universe by making 
   himself a fit receptacle for it, and arranging conditions so that its nature 
   compels it to flow toward him.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: If I want pure water to drink, I dig a well in a place where 
   there is underground water; I prevent it from leaking away; and I arrange to 
   take advantage of water's accordance with the laws of Hydrostatics to fill it.) 
 </p><p> <strong>19) Man's sense of himself as seperate from, and opposed to, the Universe 
   is a bar to his conducting its currents. It insulates him.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: A popular leader is most successful when he forgets himself 
   and remembers only "The Cause". Self-seeking engenders jealousies and schism. 
   When the organs of the body assert their presence other by silent satisfaction, 
   it is a sign they are diseased. The single exception is the organ of reproduction. 
   Yet even in this case its self-assertion bears witness to its dissatisfaction 
   with itself, since it cannot fulfil its function until completed by its counterpart 
   in another organism.) 
 </p><p> <strong>20) Man can only attract and employ the forces for which he is really 
   fitted.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: You cannot make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. A true man 
   of science learns from every phenomeneon. But Nature is dumb to the hypocrite; 
   for in her there is nothing false.) 
 </p><blockquote><em>It is no objection that the hypocrite is himself part of Nature. 
   He is an "endothermic" product, divided against himself, with a tendency to 
   break up. He will see his own qualities everywhere, and thus obtain a radical 
   misconception of phenomena. Most religions of the past have failed by expecting 
   nature to conform with their ideals of proper conduct.</em></blockquote>
 <strong>21) There is no limit to the extent of the relations of any man with the 
 Universe in essence; for as soon as man makes himself one with any idea the means 
 of measurement cease to exist. But his power to utilize that force is limited 
 by his mental power and capacity, and by the circumstances of his human environment.</strong> 
 <p> (Illustration: When a man falls in love, the whole world becomes, to him, 
   nothing but love boundless and immanent; but his mystical state is not contagious; 
   his fellow-men are either amused or annoyed. He can only extend to others the 
   effect which his love has had upon himself by means of his mental and physical 
   qualities. Thus Catullus, Dante and Swinburne made their love a mighty mover 
   of mankind by virtue of their power to put their thoughts on the subject in 
   musical and eloquent language. Again, Cleopatra and other people in authority 
   moulded the fortunes of many other people by allowing love to influence their 
   political actions. The Magician, however well he succeed in making contact with 
   the secret sources of energy in nature, can only use them to the extent permitted 
   by his intellectual and moral qualities. Mohammed's intercourse with Gabriel 
   was only effective because of his statesmanship, soldiership, and the sublimity 
   of his command of Arabic. Hertz's discovery of the rays which we now use for 
   wireless telegraphy was sterile until it reflected through the minds and wills 
   of the people who could take his truth and transmit it to the world of action 
   by means of mechanical and economic instruments.) 
 </p><p> <strong>22) Every individual is essentially sufficient to himself. But he 
   is unsatisfactory to himself until he has established himself in his right relation 
   with the universe.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: A microscope, however perfect, is useless in the hands of savages. 
   A poet, however sublime, must impose himself upon his generation if he is to 
   enjoy (and even to understand) himself, as theoretically should be the case.) 
 </p><p> <strong>23) Magick is the Science of understanding oneself and one's conditions. 
   It is the Art of applying that understanding in action.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: A golf club is intended to move a special ball in a special 
   way in special circumstances. A Niblick should rarely be used on the tee or 
   a brassie under the bank of a bunker. But also, the use of any club demands 
   skill and experience.) 
 </p><p> <strong>24) Every man has an indefeasible right to be what he is.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: To insist that any one else should comply with one's own standards 
   is to outrage, not only him, but oneself, since both parties are equally born 
   of necessity.) 
 </p><p> <strong>25) Every man must do Magick each time he acts or even thinks, since 
   a thought is an internal act whose influence ultimately affects action, though 
   it may not do so at the time.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: The least gesture causes a change in a man's own body and in 
   the air around him; it disturbs the balance of the entire Universe, and its 
   effects continue eternally throughout all space. Every thought, however swiftly 
   suppressed, has its effect on the mind. It stands as one of the causes of every 
   subsequent thought, and tends to influence every subsequent action. A golfer 
   may lose a few yards on his drive, a few more with his second and third, he 
   may lie on the green six bare inches too far from the hole, but the net result 
   of these trifling mishaps is the difference between halving and losing the hole.) 
 </p><p> <strong>26) Every man has a right, the right of self preservation, to fulfill 
   himself to the utmost.</strong> 
 </p><blockquote><em>Men of "criminal nature" are simply at issue with their true Wills. 
   The murderer has the Will to Live; and his will to murder is a false will at 
   variance with his true Will, since he risks death at the hands of Society by 
   obeying his criminal impulse.</em></blockquote>
 (Illustration: A function imperfectly performed injures, not only itself, but 
 everything associated with it. If the heart is afraid to beat for fear of disturbing 
 the liver, the liver is starved for blood and avenges itself on the heart by upsetting 
 digestion, which disorders respiration, on which cardiac welfare depends.) 
 <p> <strong>27) Every man should make Magick the keystone of his life. He should 
   learn its laws and live by them.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: The Banker should discover the real meaning of his existence, 
   the real motive which led him to choose that profession. He should under-stand 
   banking as a necessary factor in the economic existence of mankind instead of 
   merely a business whose objects are independant of the general welfare. He should 
   learn to distinguish false values from real, and to act not on accidental fluctuations 
   but on considerations of essential importance. Such a banker will prove himself 
   superior to others; because he will not be an individual limited by transitory 
   things, but a force of Nature, as impersonal, impartial and eternal as gravitation, 
   as patient and irresistable as the tides. His system will not be subject to 
   panic, any more than the law of Inverse Squares is disturbed by elections. He 
   will not be anxious about his affairs because they will not be his; and for 
   that reason he will be able to direct them with the calm, clear-headed confidence 
   of an onlooker, with intelligence unclouded by self-interest, and power unimpaired 
   by passion.) 
 </p><p> <strong>28) Every man has a right to fulfill his own will without being afraid 
   that it may interfere with that of others; for if he is in his proper place, 
   it is the fault of others if they interfere with him.</strong> 
 </p><p> (Illustration: If a man like Napoleon were actually appointed by destiny to 
   control Europe, he should not be blamed for exercising his rights. To oppose 
   him would be an error. Any one so doing would have made a mistake as to his 
   own destiny, except insofar as it mught be necessary for him to learn the lessons 
   of defeat. The sun moves in space without interference. the order of nature 
   provides an orbit for each star. A clash proves that one or the other has strayed 
   from its course. But as to each man that keeps his true course, the more firmly 
   he acts, the less likely others are to get in his way. His example will helpthem 
   to find their own paths and pursue them. Every man that becomes a Magician helps 
   others to do likewise. The more firmly and surely men move, and the more such 
   action is accepted as the standard of morality, the less will conflict and confusion 
   hamper humanity.) 
 </p><hr>
 I hope that the above principles will demonstrate to<br>
 <strong> ALL</strong><br>
 that their welfare, their very existence, is bound up in<br>
 <strong> MAGICK.</strong><br>
 I trust that they will understand, not only the reasonableness, but the necessity 
 of the fundamental truth which I was the means of giving to mankind:<br>
 <strong>"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law."</strong> I trust that 
 they will assert themselves as individually absolute, that they will grasp the 
 fact that it is their right to assert themselves, and to accomplish the task for 
 which their nature fits them. Yea, more, that this is their duty, and that not 
 only to themselves but to others, a duty founded upon universal necessity, and 
 not to be shirked on account of any casual circumstances of the moment which may 
 seem to put such conduct in the light of inconvenience or even of cruelty.<br>
 I hope that the principles outlined above will help them to understand this book, 
 and prevent them from being deterred from its study by the more or less technical 
 language in which it is written.<br>
 The essence of<br>
 <strong> MAGICK</strong><br>
 is simple enough in all conscience. It is not otherwise with the art of government. 
 The Aim is simply prosperity; but the theory is tangled, and the practice beset 
 with briars.<br>
 In the same way<br>
 <strong> MAGICK</strong><br>
 is merely to be and to do. I should add: "to suffer". For Magick is the verb; 
 and it is part of the Training to use the passive voice. This is, however, a matter 
 of Initiation rather than of Magick in its ordinary sense. It is not my fault 
 if being is baffling, and doing desperate!
 <p> Yet, once the above principles are firmly fixed in the mind, it is easy enough 
   to sum up the situation very shortly. One must find out for oneself, and make 
   sure beyond doubt, "who" one is, "what" one is, "why" one is. This done, one 
   may put the will which is implicit in the "Why" into words, or rather into One 
   Word. Being thus conscious of the proper course to pursue, the next thing is 
   to understand the conditions necessary to following it out. After that, one 
   must eliminate from oneself every element alien or hostile to success, and develop 
   those parts of oneself which are specially needed to control the aforesaid conditions.
 </p><p> Let us make an analogy. A nation must become aware of its own character before 
   it can be said to exist. From that knowledge it must divine its destiny. It 
   must then consider the political conditions of the world; how other countries 
   may help it or hinder it. It must then destroy it itself any elements discordant 
   with its destiny. Lastly, it must develop in itself those qualities which will 
   enable it to combat successfully the external conditions which threaten to oppose 
   is purpose. We have had a recent example in the case of the young German Empire, 
   which, knowing itself and its will, disciplined and trained itself so that it 
   conquered the neighbours which had oppressed it for so many centuries. But after 
   1866 and 1870, 1914! It mistook itself for superhuman, it willed a thing impossible, 
   it failed to eliminate its own internal jealousies, it failed to understand 
   the conditions of victory,

 it did not train itself to hold the sea, and thus, having violated every principle 
 of<br>
 <strong> MAGICK,</strong><br>
 it was pulled down and broken into pieces by provincialism and democracy, so that 
 neither individual excellence nor civic virtue has yet availed to raise it again 
 to that majestic unity which made so bold a bid for the mastery of the race of 
 man.
 <p> The sincere student will discover, behind the symbolic technicalities of his 
   book, a practical method of making himself a Magician. The processes described 
   will enable him to discriminate between what he actually is, and what he has 
   fondly imagined himself to be.
 </p><blockquote><em>Professor Sigmund Freud and his school have, in recent years, 
   discovered a part of this body of Truth, which has been taught for many centuries 
   in the Sanctuaries of Initiation. But failure to grasp the fullness of Truth, 
   especially that implied in my Sixth Theorem (above) and its corollaries, has 
   led him and his followers into the error of admitting that the avowedly suicidal 
   "Censor" is the proper arbiter of conduct. Official psycho-analysis is therefore 
   committed to upholding a fraud, although the foundation of the science was the 
   observation of the disastrous effects on the individual of being false to his 
   Unconscious Self, whose "writing on the wall" in dream language is the record 
   of the sum of the essential tendencies of the true nature of the individual. 
   The result has been that psycho-analysts have misinterpreted life, and announced 
   the absurdity that every human being is essentially an anti-social, criminal, 
   and insane animal. It is evident that the errors of the Unconscious of which 
   the psycho-analysts complain are neither more nor less than the"original sin" 
   of the theologians whom they despise so heartily.</em></blockquote>
 He must behold his soul in all its awful nakedness, he must not fear to look on 
 that appalling actuality. He must discard the gaudy garments with which his shame 
 has screened him; he must accept the fact that nothing can make him anything but 
 what he is. He may lie to himself, drug himself, hide himself; but he is always 
 there. Magick will teach him that his mind is playing him traitor. It is as if 
 a man were told that tailors' fashion-plates were the canon of human beauty, so 
 that he tried to make himself formless and featureless like them, and shuddered 
 with horror at the idea of Holbein making a portrait of him. Magick will show 
 him the beauty and majesty of the self which he has tried to suppress and disguise.
 <p> Having discovered his identity, he will soon perceive his purpose. Another 
   process will show him how to make that purpose pure and powerful. He may then 
   learn how to estimate his environment, learn how to make allies, how to make 
   himself prevail against all powers whose error has caused them to wander across 
   his path.
 </p><p> In the course of this Training, he will learn to explore the Hidden Mysteries 
   of Nature, and to develop new senses and faculties in himself, whereby he may 
   communicate with, and control, Beings and Forces pertaining to orders of existence 
   which have been hitherto inaccessible to profane research, and available only 
   to that unscientific and empirical<br>

   I send this book into the world that every man and woman may take hold of life 
   in the proper manner. It does not matter of one's present house of flesh be 
   the hut of a shepherd; by virtue of my<br>

   he shall be such a shepherd as David was. If it be the studio of a sculptor, 
   he shall so chisel from himself the marble that masks his idea that he shall 
   be no less a master than Rodin.
