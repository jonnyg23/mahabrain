 <h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER V<br>
   The Formula of I.A.O.</h2>
 This formula is the principal and most characteristic formula of Osiris, of the 
 Redemption of Mankind. "I" is Isis, Nature, ruined by "A", Apophis the Destroyer, 
 and restored to life by the Redeemer Osiris. 
 <blockquote><em>There is a quite different formula in which I is the father, O 
   the Mother, A the child --- and yet another, in which I.A.O. are all fathers 
   of different kinds balanced by H.H.H., 3 Mothers, to complete the Universe. 
   In a third, the true formula of the Beast 666, I and O are the opposites which 
   form the field for the operation of A. But this is a higher matter unsuited 
   for this elementary handbook. See, however, Liber Samekh, Point II, Section 
   J.</em></blockquote>
 The same idea is expressed by the Rosicrucian formula of the Trinity: 
 <p> "Ex Deo nascimur. In Jesu Morimur 
 </p><p> Per Spiritum Sanctum reviviscimus." 
 </p><p> This is also identical with the Word Lux, L.V.X., which is formed by the arms 
   of a cross. It is this formula which is implied in those ancient and modern 
   monuments in which the phallus is worshipped as the Saviour of the World. 
 </p><p> The doctrine of resurrection as vulgarly understood is false and absurd. It 
   is not even "Scriptural". St. Paul does not identify the glorified body which 
   rises with the mortal body which dies. On the contrary, he repeatedly insists 
   on the distinction. 
 </p><p> The same is true of a magical ceremony. The magician who is destroyed by absorption 
   in the Godhead is really destroyed. The miserable mortal automaton remains in 
   the Circle. It is of no more consequence to Him that the dust of the floor. 
 </p><blockquote><em>It is, for all that, His instrument, acquired by Him as an astronomer 
   buys a telescope. See Liber Aleph, for a full explanation of the objects attained 
   by the stratagem of incarnation; also Part IV of this Book 4.</em></blockquote>
 But before entering into the details of "I.A.O." as a magick formula it should 
 be remarked that it is essentially the formula of Yoga or meditation; in fact, 
 of elementary mysticism in all its branches. 
 <p> In beginning a meditation practice, there is always 
 </p><blockquote><em>If not, one is not working properly.</em></blockquote>
 a quiet pleasure, a gentle natural growth; one takes a lively interest in the 
 work; it seems easy; one is quite pleased to have started. This stage represents 
 Isis. Sooner or later it is succeeded by depression --- the Dark Night of the 
 Soul, an infinite weariness and detestation of the work. The simplest and easiest 
 acts become almost impossible to perform. Such impotence fills the mind with apprehension 
 and despair. The intensity of this loathing can hardly be understood by any person 
 who has not experienced it. This is the period of Apophis. 
 <p> It is followed by the arising not of Isis, but of Osiris. The ancient condition 
   is not restored, but a new and superior condition is created, a condition only 
   rendered possible by the process of death. 
 </p><p> The Alchemists themselves taught this same truth. The first matter of the 
   work was base and primitive, though "natural". After passing through various 
   stages the "black dragon" appeared; but from this arose the pure and perfect 
   gold. 
 </p><p> Even in the legend of Prometheus we find an identical formula concealed; and 
   a similar remark applies to those of Jesus Christ, and of many other mythical 
   god-men worshipped in different countries. 
 </p><blockquote><em>See J.G.Frazer, "The Golden Bough:" J.M.Robertson "Pagan Christs;" 
   A. Crowley "Jesus," etc., etc.</em></blockquote>
 A magical ceremony constructed on this formula is thus in close essential harmony 
 with the natural mystic process. We find it the basis of many important initiations, 
 notably the Third Degree in Masonry, and the 5 Degree = 6Square ceremony of the 
 G.'. D.'. described in Equinox I, III. A ceremonial self-initiation may be constructed 
 with advantage on this formula. The essence of it consists in robing yourself 
 as a king, then stripping and slaying yourself, and rising from that death to 
 the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel 
 <blockquote><em>This formula, although now superseded by that of HORUS, the Crowned 
   and Conquering Child, remains valid for those who have not yet assimilated the 
   point of view of the Law of Thelema. But see Appendix, Liber SAMEKH. Compare 
   also "The Book of the Spirit of the Living Gods," -- where there is a ritual 
   given "in extenso" on slightly different lines: Equinox I, III, pages 269-272.</em></blockquote>
 . There is an etymological identity between Tetragrammaton and "I A O", but the 
 magical formulae are entirely different, as the descriptions here given have schewn. 
 <p> Professor William James, in his "Varieties of Religious Experience," has well 
   classified religion as the "once-born" and the "twice-born"; but the religion 
   now proclaimed in Liber Legis harmonizes these by transcending them. There is 
   no attempt to get rid of death by denying it, as among the once-born; nor to 
   accept death as the gate of a new life, as among the twice-born. With the A.'. 
   A.'. life and death are equally incidents in a career, very much like day and 
   night in the history of a planet. But, to pursue the simile, we regard this 
   planet from afar. A Brother of A.'. A.'. looks at (what another person would 
   call) "himself", as one --- or, rather, some --- among a group of phenomena. 
   He is that "nothing" whose consciousness is in one sense the universe considered 
   as a single phenomenon in time and space, and in another sense is the negation 
   of that consciousness. The body and mind of the man are only important (if at 
   all) as the telescope of the astronomer to him. If the telescope were destroyed 
   it would make no appreciable difference to the Universe which that telescope 
   reveals. 
 </p><p> It will now be understood that this formula of I A O is a formula of Tiphareth. 
   The magician who employs it is conscious of himself as a man liable to suffering, 
   and anxious to transcend that state by becoming one with god. It will appear 
   to him as the Supreme Ritual, as the final step; but, as has already been pointed 
   out, it is but a preliminary. For the normal man today, however, it represents 
   considerable attainment; and there is a much earlier formula whose investigation 
   will occupy Chapter VI. 
 </p><p> THE MASTER THERION, in the Seventeenth year of the Aeon, has reconstructed 
   the Word I A O to satisfy the new conditions of Magick imposed by progress. 
   The Word of the Law being Thelema, whose number is 93, this number should be 
   the canon of a corresponding Mass. Accordingly, he has expanded I A O by treating 
   the O as an Ayin, and then adding Vau as prefix and affix. The full word is 
   then 
 </p><p> Vau Yod Aleph Ayin Vau 
 </p><p> whose number is 93. We may analyse this new Word in detail and demonstrate 
   that it is a proper hieroglyph of the Ritual of Self-Initiation in this Aeon 
   of Horus. For the correspondence in the following note, see Liber 777. The principal 
   points are these:

 Iota-Alpha-Digamma varies in significance with successive Aeons. 
 <p> "Aeon of Isis." Matriarchal Age. The Great Work conceived as a straightforward 
   simple affair. We find the theory reflected in the customs of Matriarchy. Parthenogenesis 
   is supposed to be true. The Virgin (Yod-Virgo) contains in herself the Principle 
   of Growth --- the epicene Hermetic seed. It becomes the Babe in the Egg (A --- 
   Harpocrates) by virtue of the Spirit (A = Air, impregnating the Mother---Vulture) 
   and this becomes the Sun or Son ( Digamma = the letter of Tiphareth, 6, even 
   when spelt as Omega, in Coptic. See 777). 
 </p><p> "Aeon of Osiris." Patriarchal age. Two sexes. I conceived as the Father-Wand. 
   (Yod in Tetragrammaton). A the Babe is pursued by the Dragon, who casts a flood 
   from his mouth to swallow it. See "Rev." VII. The Dragon is also the Mother 
   --- the "Evil Mother" of Freud. It is Harpocrates, threatened by the crocodile 
   in the Nile. We find the symbolism of the Ark, the Coffin of Osiris, etc. The 
   Lotus is the Yoni; the Water the Amniotic Fluid. In order to live his own life, 
   the child must leave the Mother, and overcome the temptation to return to her 
   for refuge. Kundry, Armida, Jocasta, Circe, etc., are symbols of this force 
   which tempts the Hero. He may take her as his servant 
 </p><blockquote><em>Her sole speech in the last Act is "Dienen: Dienen".</em></blockquote>
 when he has mastered her, so as to heal his father (Amfortas), avenge him (Osiris), 
 or pacify him (Jehovah). But in order to grow to manhood, he must cease to depend 
 on her, earning the Lance (Parzival), claiming his arms (Achilles), or making 
 his club (Hercules) 
 <blockquote><em>Note that all these three remain for a time as neuters among woman, 
   prevented from living the male life.</em></blockquote>
 , and wander in the waterless wilderness like Krishna, Jesus, Oedipus, chi. tau. 
 lambda. --- until the hour when, as the "King's Son" or knight-errant, he must 
 win the Princess, and set himself upon a strange throne. Almost all the legends 
 of heroes imply this formula in strikingly similar symbols. Digamma. Vau the Sun 
 --- Son. He is supposed to be mortal; but how is this shewn? It seems an absolute 
 perversion of truth: the sacred symbols have no hint of it. This lie is the essence 
 of the Great Sorcery. Osirian religion is a Freudian phantasy fashioned of man's 
 dread of death and ignorance of nature. The parthenogenesis-idea persists, but 
 is now the formula for incarnating demi-gods, or divine kings; these must be slain 
 and raised from the dead in one way or another. 
 <blockquote><em>All these ideas may be explained by reference to anthropology. 
   But this is not their condemnation, but their justification; for the customs 
   and legends of mankind reflect the true nature of the species.</em></blockquote>
 "Aeon of Horus." Two sexes in one person. 
 <p> Digamma Iota Alpha Omicron Digamma: 93, the full formula, recognizing the 
   Sun as the Son (Star), as the pre-existent manifested Unit from which all springs 
   and to which all returns. The Great Work is to make the initial Digamma Digamma 
   of Assiah (The world of material illusion) into the final Digamma Iota Digamma 
   of Atziluth, 
 </p><blockquote><em>For these spellings see 777.</em></blockquote>
 the world of pure reality. 
 <p> Spelling the Name in full, Digamma Digamma + Iota Digamma Delta + Alpha Lambda 
   Pi + Omicron Iota Nu + Digamma Iota = 309 = Sh T = XX + XI = 31 the secret Key 
   of the Law. 
 </p><p> Digamma is the manifested Star. Iota is the secret Life .............. Serpent 
 </p><p> --- Light ............. Lamp 
 </p><p> --- Love .............. Wand 
 </p><p> --- Liberty ........... Wings 
 </p><p> --- Silence ........... Cloak 
 </p><p> These symbols are all shewn in the Atu "The Hermit". 
 </p><p> They are the powers of the Yod, whose extension is the Vau. 
 </p><p> Yod is the Hand wherewith man does his Will. It is also 
 </p><p> The Virgin; his essence is inviolate. 
 </p><p> Alpha is the Babe "who has formulated his Father, and made fertile 
 </p><p> his Mother" --- Harpocrates, etc., as before; but he develops 
 </p><p> to 
 </p><p> Omicron The exalted "Devil" (also the "other" secret Eye) by the 
 </p><p> formula of the Initiation of Horus elsewhere described in 
 </p><p> detail. This "Devil" is called Satan or Shaitan, and regarded with horror 
   by people who are ignorant of his formula, and, imagining themselves to be evil, 
   accuse Nature herself of their own phantasmal crime. Satan is Saturn, Set, Abrasax, 
   Adad, Adonis, Attis, Adam, Adonai, etc. The most serious charge against him 
   is that he is the Sun in the South. The Ancient Initiates, dwelling as they 
   did in lands whose blood was the water of the Nile or the Euphrates, connected 
   the South with life-withering heat, and cursed that quarter where the solar 
   darts were deadliest. Even in the legend of Hiram, it is at high noon that he 
   is stricken down and slain. Capricornus is moreover the sign which the sun enterers 
   when he reaches his extreme Southern declination at the Winter Solstice, the 
   season of the death of vegetation, for the folk of the Northern hemisphere. 
   This gave them a second cause for cursing the south. A third; the tyranny of 
   hot, dry, poisonous winds; the menace of deserts or oceans dreadful because 
   mysterious and impassable; these also were connected in their minds with the 
   South. But to us, aware of astronomical facts, this antagonism to the South 
   is a silly superstition which the accidents of their local conditions suggested 
   to our animistic ancestors. We see no enmity between Right and Left, Up and 
   Down, and similar pairs of opposites. These antitheses are real only as a statement 
   of relation; they are the conventions of an arbitrary device for representing 
   our ideas in a pluralistic symbolism based on duality. "Good" must be defined 
   in terms of human ideals and instincts. "East" has no meaning except with reference 
   to the earth's internal affairs; as an absolute direction in space it changes 
   a degree every four minutes. "Up" is the same for no two men, unless one chance 
   to be in the line joining the other with the centre of the earth. "Hard" is 
   the private opinion of our muscles. "True" is an utterly unintelligible epithet 
   which has proved refractory to the analysis of our ablest philosophers. 
 </p><p> We have therefore no scruple in restoring the "devil-worship" of such ideas 
   as those which the laws of sound, and the phenomena of speech and hearing, compel 
   us to connect with the group of "Gods" whose names are based upon Sht, or D, 
   vocalized by the free breath A. For these Names imply the qualities of courage, 
   frankness, energy, pride, power and triumph; they are the words which express 
   the creative and paternal will. 
 </p><p> Thus "the Devil" is Capricornus, the Goat who leaps upon the loftiest mountains, 
   the Godhead which, if it become manifest in man, makes him Aegipan, the All. 
 </p><p> The Sun enters this sign when he turns to renew the year in the North. He 
   is also the vowel O, proper to roar, to boom, and to command, being a forcible 
   breath controlled by the firm circle of the mouth. 
 </p><p> He is the Open Eye of the exalted Sun, before whom all shadows flee away: 
   also that Secret Eye which makes an image of its God, the Light, and gives it 
   power to utter oracles, enlightening the mind. 
 </p><p> Thus, he is Man made God, exalted, eager; he has come consciously to his full 
   stature, and so is ready to set out on his journey to redeem the world. But 
   he may not appear in this true form; the Vision of Pan would drive men mad with 
   fear. He must conceal Himself in his original guise. 
 </p><p> He therefore becomes apparently the man that he was at the beginning; he lives 
   the life of a man; indeed, he is wholly man. But his initiation has made him 
   master of the Event by giving him the understanding that whatever happens to 
   him is the execution of this true will. Thus the last stage of his initiation 
   is expressed in our formula as the final: 
 </p><p> Digamma --- The series of transformations has not affected his identity; but 
   it has explained him to himself. Similarly, Copper is still Copper after 
 </p><p> Cu+O = CuO:+H SO =CuS O(H O):+K S=CuS(K SO ): 
 </p><p> 2 4 4 2 2 2 4 + blowpipe and reducing agent = Cu(S). 
 </p><p> It is the same copper, but we have learnt some of its properties. We observe 
   especially that it is indestructible, inviolably itself throughout all its adventures, 
   and in all its disguises. We see moreover that it can only make use of its powers, 
   fulfill the possibilities of its nature, and satisfy its equations, by thus 
   combining with its counterparts. Its existence as a separate substance is evidence 
   of its subjection to stress; and this is felt as the ache of an incomprehensible 
   yearning until it realises that every experience is a relief, an expression 
   of itself; and that it cannot be injured by aught that may befall it. In the 
   Aeon of Osiris it was indeed realised that Man must die in order to live. But 
   now in the Aeon of Horus we know that every event is a death; subject and object 
   slay each other in "love under will"; each such death is itself life, the means 
   by which one realises oneself in a series of episodes. 
 </p><p> The second main point is the completion of the A babe Bacchus by the O Pan 
   (Parzival wins the Lance, etc.). 
 </p><p> The first process is to find the I in the V --- initiation, purification, 
   finding the Secret Root of oneself, the epicene Virgin who is 10 (Malkuth) but 
   spelt in full 20 (Jupiter). 
 </p><p> This Yod in the "Virgin" expands to the Babe in the Egg by formulating the 
   Secret Wisdom of Truth of Hermes in the Silence of the Fool. He acquires the 
   Eye-Wand, beholding the acting and being adored. The Inverted Pentagram --- 
   Baphomet --- the Hermaphrodite fully grown --- begets himself on himself as 
   V again. 
 </p><p> Note that there are now two sexes in one person throughout, so that each individual 
   is self-procreative sexually, whereas Isis knew only one sex, and Osiris thought 
   the two sexes opposed. Also the formula is now Love in all cases; and the end 
   is the beginning, on a higher plane. 
 </p><p> The I is formed from the V by removing its tail, the A by balancing 4 Yods, 
   the O by making an inverted triangle of Yods, which suggests the formula of 
   Nuit --- Hadit --- Ra-Hoor-Khuit. A is the elements whirling as a Svastika --- 
   the creative Energy in equilibrated action.
