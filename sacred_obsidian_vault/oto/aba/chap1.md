   THE PRINCIPLES OF RITUAL.</h2>
 There is a single main definition of the object of all magical Ritual. It is the 
 uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm. The Supreme and Complete Ritual is 
 therefore the Invocation of the Holy Guardian Angel; 
 <blockquote><em>See the "Book of the Sacred Magic of Abramelin the Mage"; and 
   Liber 418, 8th Aethyr, Liber Samekh; see Appendix 3.</em></blockquote>
 or, in the language of Mysticism, Union with God. 
 <blockquote><em>The difference between these operations is more of theoretical 
   than of practical importance.</em></blockquote>
 All other magical Rituals are particular cases of this general principle, and 
 the only excuse for doing them is that it sometimes occurs that one particular 
 portion of the microcosm is so weak that its imperfection of impurity would vitiate 
 the Macrocosm of which it is the image, Eidolon, or Reflexion. For example, God 
 is above sex; and therefore neither man nor woman as such can be said fully to 
 understand, much less to represent, God. It is therefore incumbent on the male 
 magician to cultivate those female virtues in which he is deficient, and this 
 task he must of course accomplish without in any way impairing his virility. It 
 will then be lawful for a magician to invoke Isis, and identify himself with her; 
 if he fail to do this, his apprehension of the Universe when he attains Samadhi 
 will lack the conception of maternity. The result will be a metaphysical and --- 
 by corollary --- ethical limitation in the Religion which he founds. Judaism and 
 Islam are striking example of this failure. 
 <p> To take another example, the ascetic life which devotion to magick so often 
   involves argues a poverty of nature, a narrowness, a lack of generosity. Nature 
   is infinitely prodigal --- not one in a million seeds ever comes to fruition. 
   Whoso fails to recognise this, let him invoke Jupiter. 
 </p><blockquote><em>There are much deeper considerations in which it appears that 
   "Everything that is, is right". They are set forth elsewhere; we can only summarise 
   them here by saying that the survival of the fittest is their upshot.</em></blockquote>
 The danger of ceremonial magick --- the sublest and deepest danger --- is this: 
 that the magician will naturally tend to invoke that partial being which most 
 strongly appeals to him, so that his natural excess in that direction will be 
 still further exaggerated. Let him, before beginning his Work, endeavour to map 
 out his own being, and arrange his invocations in such a way as to redress the 
 balance. 
 <blockquote><em>The ideal method of doing this is given in Liber 913 (Equinox 
   VII). See also Liber CXI Aleph.</em></blockquote>
 This, of course, should have been done in a preliminary fashion during the preparation 
 of the weapons and furniture of the Temple. 
 <p> To consider in a more particular manner this question of the Nature of Ritual, 
   we may suppose that he finds himself lacking in that perception of the value 
   of Life and Death, alike of individuals and of races, which is characteristic 
   of Nature. He has perhaps a tendency to perceive the "first noble truth" uttered 
   by Buddha, that Everything is sorrow. Nature, it seems, is a tragedy. He has 
   perhaps even experienced the great trance called Sorrow. He should then consider 
   whether there is not some Deity who expresses this Cycle, and yet whose nature 
   is joy. He will find what he requires in Dionysus. 
 </p><p> There are three main methods of invoking any Deity. 
 </p><p> The "First Method" consists of devotion to that Deity, and, being mainly mystical 
   in character, need not be dealt with in this place, especially as a perfect 
   instruction exists in Liber 175 ("See" Appendix). 
 </p><p> The "Second method"is the straight forward ceremonial invocation. It is the 
   method which was usually employed in the Middle Ages. Its advantage is its directness, 
   its disadvantage its crudity. The "Goetia" gives clear instruction in this method, 
   and so do many other rituals, white and black. We shall presently devote some 
   space to a clear exposition of this Art. 
 </p><p> In the case of Bacchus, however, we may roughly outline the procedure. We 
   find that the symbolism of Tiphareth expresses the nature of Bacchus. It is 
   then necessary to construct a Ritual of Tiphareth. Let us open the Book 777; 
   we shall find in line 6 of each column the various parts of our required apparatus. 
   Having ordered everything duly, we shall exalt the mind by repeated prayers 
   or conjurations to the highest conception of the God, until, in one sense or 
   another of the word, He appears to us and floods our consciousness with the 
   light of His divinity. 
 </p><p> The "Third Method is the Dramatic," perhaps the most attractive of all; certainly 
   it is so to the artist's temperament, for it appeals to his imagination through 
   his aesthetic sense. 
 </p><p> Its disadvantage lies principally in the difficulty of its performance by 
   a single person. But it has the sanction of the highest antiquity, and is probably 
   the most useful for the foundation of a religion. It is the method of Catholic 
   Christianity, and consists in the dramatization of the legend of the God. The 
   Bacchae of Euripides is a magnificent example of such a Ritual; so also, through 
   in a less degree, is the Mass. We may also mention many of the degrees in Freemasonry, 
   particularly the third. The 5'=6' Ritual published in No. III of the Equinox 
   is another example. 
 </p><p> In the case of Bacchus, one commemorates firstly his birth of a mortal mother 
   who has yielded her treasure-house to the Father of All, of the jealousy and 
   rage excited by this incarnation, and of the heavenly protection afforded to 
   the infant. Next should be commemorated the journeying westward upon an ass. 
   Now comes the great scene of the drama: the gentle, exquisite youth with his 
   following (chiefly composed of women) seems to threaten the established order 
   of things, and that Established Order takes steps to put an end to the upstart. 
   We find Dionysus confronting the angry King, not with defiance, but with meekness; 
   yet with a subtle confidence, an underlying laughter. His forehead is wreathed 
   with vine tendrils. He is an effeminate figure with those broad leaves clustered 
   upon his brow? But those leaves hide horns. King Pentheus, representative of 
   respectability, 
 </p><blockquote><em>There is a much deeper interpretation in which Pentheus is himself 
   "The Dying God". See my "Good Hunting!" and Dr. J.G.Frazer's "Golden Bough".</em></blockquote>
 is destroyed by his pride. He goes out into the mountains to attack the women 
 who have followed Bacchus, the youth whom he has mocked, scourged, and put in 
 chains, yet who has only smiled; and by those women, in their divine madness, 
 he is torn to pieces. 
 <p> It has already seemed impertinent to say so much when Walter Pater has told 
   the story with such sympathy and insight. We will not further transgress by 
   dwelling upon the identity of this legend with the course of Nature, its madness, 
   its prodigality, its intoxication, its joy, and above all its sublime persistence 
   through the cycles of Life and Death. The pagan reader must labour to understand 
   this in Pater's "Greek Studies", and the Christian reader will recognise it, 
   incident for incident, in the story of Christ. This legend is but the dramatization 
   of Spring. 
 </p><p> The magician who wishes to invoke Bacchus by this method must therefore arrange 
   a ceremony in which he takes the part of Bacchus, undergoes all His trials, 
   and emerges triumphant from beyond death. He must, however, be warned against 
   mistaking the symbolism. In this case, for example, the doctrine of individual 
   immortality has been dragged in, to the destruction of truth. It is not that 
   utterly worthless part of man, his individual consciousness as John Smith, which 
   defies death --- that consciousness which dies and is reborn in every thought. 
   That which persists (if anything persist) is his real John Smithiness, a quality 
   of which he was probably never conscious in his life. 
 </p><blockquote><em>See "The Book of Lies", Liber 333, for several sermons to this 
   effect. Caps. Alpha, Delta, Eta, Iota-Epsilon, Iota-Sigma, Iota-Eta, Kappa-Alpha, 
   Kappa-Eta, in particular. The reincarnation of the Khu or magical Self is another 
   matter entirely, too abstruse to discuss in this elementary manual. {WEH NOTE: 
   I have made a correction in the above list of chapters from Liber 333. The published 
   text cites Iota-Digamma, which does not exist. The correct chapter is Iota-Sigma, 
   which does exist and discusses the subject}.</em></blockquote>
 Even that does not persist unchanged. It is always growing. The Cross is a barren 
 stick, and the petals of the Rose fall and decay; but in the union of the Cross 
 and the Rose is a constant succession of new lives. 
 <blockquote><em>See "The Book of Lies", Liber 333, for several sermons to this 
   effect. The whole theory of Death must be sought in Liber CXI Aleph.</em></blockquote>
 Without this union, and without this death of the individual, the cycle would 
 be broken. 
 <p> A chapter will be consecrated to removing the practical difficulties of this 
   method of Invocation. It will doubtless have been noted by the acumen of the 
   reader that in the great essentials these three methods are one. In each case 
   the magician identifies himself with the Deity invoked. To "invoke" is to "call 
   in", just as to "evoke" is to "call forth". This is the essential difference 
   between the two branches of Magick. In invocation, the macrocosm floods the 
   consciousness. In evocation, the magician, having become the macrocosm, creates 
   a microcosm. You "in"voke a God into the Circle. You "e"voke a Spirit into the 
   Triangle. In the first method identity with the God is attained by love and 
   by surrender, by giving up or suppressing all irrelevant (and illusionary) parts 
   of yourself. It is the weeding of a garden. 
 </p><p> In the second method identity is attained by paying special attention to the 
   desired part of yourself: positive, as the first method is negative. It is the 
   potting-out and watering of a particular flower in the garden, and the exposure 
   of it to the sun. 
 </p><p> In the third, identity is attained by sympathy. It is very difficult for the 
   ordinary man to lose himself completely in the subject of a play or of a novel; 
   but for those who can do so, this method is unquestionably the best. 
 </p><p> Observe: each element in this cycle is of equal value. It is wrong to say 
   triumphantly "Mors janua vitae", unless you add, with equal triumph, "Vita janua 
   mortis". To one who understands this chain of the Aeons from the point of view 
   alike of the sorrowing Isis and of the triumphant Osiris, not forgetting their 
   link in the destroyer Apophis, there remains no secret veiled in Nature. He 
   cries that name of God which throughout History has been echoed by one religion 
   to another, the infinite swelling paean I.A.O.! 
 </p><blockquote><em>This name, I.A.O. is qabalistically identical with that of THE 
   BEAST and with His number 666, so that he who invokes the former invokes also 
   the latter. Also with AIWAZ and the Number 93. See Chapter V.</em></blockquote>
