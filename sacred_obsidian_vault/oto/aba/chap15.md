   OF THE INVOCATION</h3>
 In the straightforward or "Protestant" system of Magick there is very little to 
 add to what has already been said. The Magician addresses a direct petition to 
 the Being invoked. But the secret of success in invocation has not hitherto been 
 disclosed. It is an exceedingly simple one. It is practically of no importance 
 whatever that the invocation should be "right". There are a thousand different 
 ways of compassing the end proposed, so far as external things are concerned. 
 The whole secret may be summarised in these four words: "Enflame thyself in praying." 
 <blockquote><em>This is Qabalistically expressed in the old Formula: Domine noster, 
   audi tuo servo! kyrie Christe! O Christe!</em></blockquote>
 <p> The mind must be exalted until it loses consciousness of self. The Magician 
   must be carried forward blindly by a force which, though in him and of him, 
   is by no means that which he in his normal state of consciousness calls I. Just 
   as the poet, the lover, the artist, is carried out of himself in a creative 
   frenzy, so must it be for the Magician. 
 </p><p> It is impossible to lay down rules for the obtaining of this special stimulus. 
   To one the mystery of the whole ceremony may appeal; another may be moved by 
   the strangeness of the words, even by the fact that the "barbarous names" are 
   unintelligible to him. Some times in the course of a ceremony the true meaning 
   of some barbarous name that has hitherto baffled his analysis may flash upon 
   him, luminous and splendid, so that he is caught up unto orgasm. The smell of 
   a particular incense may excite him effectively, or perhaps the physical ecstasy 
   of the magick dance. 
 </p><p> Every Magician must compose his ceremony in such a manner as to produce a 
   dramatic cilmax. At the moment when the excitement becomes ungovernable, when 
   then the whole conscious being of the Magician undergoes a spiritual spasm, 
   at that moment must he utter the supreme adjuration. 
 </p><p> One very effective method is to stop short, by a supreme effort of will, again 
   and again, on the very brink of that spasm, until a time arrives when the idea 
   of exercising that will fails to occur 
 </p><blockquote><em>This forgetfulness must be complete; it is fatal to try to "let 
   oneself go" consciously.</em></blockquote>
 <p> . Inhibition is no longer possible or even thinkable, and the whole being 
   of the Magician, no minutest atom saying nay, is irresistibly flung forth. In 
   blinding light, amid the roar of ten thousand thunders, the Union of God and 
   man is consummated. 
 </p><p> If the Magician is still seen standing in the Circle, quietly pursuing his 
   invocations, it is that all the conscious part of him has become detached from 
   the true ego which lies behind that normal consciousness. But the circle is 
   wholly filled with that divine essence; all else is but an accident and an illusion. 
 </p><p> The subsequent invocations, the gradual development and materialization of 
   the force, require no effort. It is one great mistake of the beginner to concentrate 
   his force upon the actual stated purpose of the ceremony. This mistake is the 
   most frequent cause of failures in invocation. 
 </p><p> A corollary of this Theorem is that the Magician soon discards evocation almost 
   altogether --- only rare circumstances demand any action what ever on the material 
   plane. The Magician devotes himself entirely to the invocation of a god; and 
   as soon as his balance approaches perfection he ceases to invoke any partial 
   god; only that god vertically above him is in his path. And so a man who perhaps 
   took up Magick merely with the idea of acquiring knowledge, love, or wealth, 
   finds himself irrevocably committed to the performance of <em>The Great Work.</em> 
 </p><p> It will now be apparent that there is no distinction between magick and meditation 
   except of the most arbitrary and accidental kind. 
 </p><blockquote><em>There is the general metaphysical antithesis that Magick is the 
   Art of the Will-to-Live, Mysticism of the Will-to-Die; but --- "Truth comes 
   bubbling to my brim; Life and Death are one to Him!".</em></blockquote>
 <h3 align="center">II</h3>
 Beside these open methods thee are also a number of mental methods of Invocation, 
 of which we may give three. 
 <p> The first method concerns the so-called astral body. The Magician should practise 
   the formation of this body as recommended in Liber O, and learn to rise on the 
   planes according to the instruction given in the same book, though limiting 
   his "rising" to the particular symbol whose God he wishes to invoke. 
 </p><p> The second is to recite a mantra suitable to the God. 
 </p><p> The third is the assumption of the form of the God --- by transmuting the 
   astral body into His shape. This last method is really essential to all proper 
   invocation, and cannot be too sedulously practised. 
 </p><p> There are many other devices to aid invocation, so many that it is impossible 
   to enumerate them; and the Magician will be wise to busy himself in inventing 
   new ones. 
 </p><p> We will give one example. 
 </p><p> Suppose the Supreme Invocation to consist of 20 to 30 barbarous names, let 
   him imagine these names to occupy sections of a vertical column, each double 
   the length of the preceding one; and let him imagine that his consciousness 
   ascends the column with each name. The mere multiplication will then produce 
   a feeling of awe and bewilderment which is the proper forerunner of exstasy. 
 </p><p> In the essay "Energized Enthusiasm" in No. IX, Vol. I of the Equinox 
 </p><blockquote><em>The earliest and truest Christians used what is in all essentials 
   this method. See "Fragments of a Faith Forgotten" by G.R.S.Mead, Esq. B. A., 
   pp. 80-81. 
   <p> There is a real connexion between what the vulgar call blasphemy and what 
     they call immorality, in the fact that the Christian legend is an echo of 
     a Phallic rite. There is also a true and positive connexion between the Creative 
     force of the Macrocosm, and that of the Microcosm. For this reason the latter 
     must be made a pure and consecrated as the former. The puzzle for most people 
     is how to do this. The study of Nature is the Key to that Gate.

   This essay should be studied with care and determination.</p></body>
