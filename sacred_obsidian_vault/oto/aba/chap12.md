   OF THE BLOODY SACRIFICE: AND MATTERS COGNATE.</h2>
 It is necessary for us to consider carefully the problems connected with the bloody 
 sacrifice, for this question is indeed traditionally important in Magick. Nigh 
 all ancient Magick revolves around this matter. In particular all the Osirian 
 religions --- the rites of the Dying God --- refer to this. The slaying of Osiris 
 and Adonis; the mutilation of Attis; the cults of Mexico and Peru; the story of 
 Hercules or Melcarth; the legends of Dionysus and of Mithra, are all connected 
 with this one idea. In the Hebrew religion we find the same thing inculcated. 
 The first ethical lesson in the Bible is that the only sacrifice pleasing to the 
 Lord is the sacrifice of blood; Abel, who made this, finding favour with the Lord, 
 while Cain, who offered cabbages, was rather naturally considered a cheap sport. 
 The idea recurs again and again. We have the sacrifice of the Passover, following 
 on the story of Abraham's being commanded to sacrifice his firstborn son, with 
 the idea of the substitution of animal for human life. The annual ceremony of 
 the two goats carries out this in perpetuity. And we see again the domination 
 of this idea in the romance of Esther, where Haman and Mordecai are the two goats 
 or gods; and ultimately in the presentation of the rite of Purim in Palestine, 
 where Jesus and Barabbas happened to be the Goats in that particular year of which 
 we hear so much, without agreement on the date.
 <p> This subject must be studied in the "Golden Bough", where it is most learnedly 
   set forth by Dr. J. G. Frazer. Enough has now been said to show that the bloody 
   sacrifice has from time immemorial been the most considered part of Magick. 
   The ethics of the thing appear to have concerned no one; nor, to tell the truth, 
   need they do so. As St. Paul says, "Without shedding of blood there is no remission"; 
   and who are we to argue with St. Paul? But, after all that, it is open to any 
   one to have any opinion that he likes upon the subject, or any other subject, 
   thank God! At the same time, it is most necessary to study the business, whatever 
   we may be going to do about it; for our ethics themselves will naturally depend 
   upon our theory of the universe. If we were quite certain, for example, that 
   everybody went to heaven when he died, there could be no serious objection to 
   murder or suicide, as it is generally conceded --- by those who know neither 
   --- that earth is not such a pleasant place as heaven. 
 </p><p> However, there is a mystery concealed in this theory of the bloody sacrifice 
   which is of great importance to the student, and we therefore make no further 
   apology, We should not have made even this apology for an apology, had it not 
   been for the solicitude of a pious young friend of great austerity of character 
   who insisted that the part of this chapter which now follows --- the part which 
   was originally written --- might cause us to be misunderstood. This must not 
   be. The blood is the life. This simple statement is explained by the Hindus 
   by saying that the blood is the principal vehicle of vital Prana. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Prana or force" is often used as a generic term for all kinds 
   of subtle energy. The prana of the body is only one of its "vayus". Vayu means 
   air or spirit. The idea is that all bodily forces are manifestations of the 
   finer forces of the more real body, this real body being a subtle and invisible 
   thing.</em></blockquote>
 There is some ground for the belief that there is a definite substance 
 <blockquote><em>This substance need not be conceived as "material" in the crude 
   sense of Victorian science; we now know that such phenomena as the rays and 
   emanations of radioactive substances occupy an intermediate position. For instance, 
   mass is not, as once supposed, necessarily impermeable to mass, and matter itself 
   can be only interpreted in terms of motion. So, as to "prana", one might hypothesize 
   a phenomenon in the ether analogous to isomerism. We already know of bodies 
   chemically identical whose molecular structure makes one active, another inactive, 
   to certain reagents. Metals can be "tired" or even "killed" as to some of their 
   properties, without discoverable chemical change. One can "kill" steel, and 
   "raise it from the dead"; and flies drowned in icewater can be resuscitated. 
   That it should be impossible to create high organic life is scientifically unthinkable, 
   and the Master Therion believes it to be a matter of few years indeed before 
   this is done in the laboratory. Already we restore the apparently drowned. Why 
   not those dead from such causes as syncope? If we understood the ultimate physics 
   and chemistry of the brief moment of death we would get hold of the force in 
   some say, supply the missing element, reverse the electrical conditions or what 
   not. Already we prevent certain kinds of death by supplying wants, as in the 
   case of Thyroid.</em></blockquote>
 , not isolated as yet, whose presence makes all the difference between live and 
 dead matter. We pass by with deserved contempt the pseudo-scientific experiments 
 of American charlatans who claim to have established that weight is lost at the 
 moment of death, and the unsupported statements of alleged clairvoyants that they 
 have seen the soul issuing like a vapour from the mouth of persons "in articulo 
 mortis"; but his experiences as an explorer have convinced the Master Therion 
 that meat loses a notable portion of its nutritive value within a very few minutes 
 after the death of the animal, and that this loss proceeds with ever-diminishing 
 rapidity as time goes on. It is further generally conceded that live food, such 
 as oysters, is the most rapidly assimilable and most concentrated form of energy. 
 <blockquote><em>Once can become actually drunk on oysters, by chewing them completely. 
   Rigor seems to be a symptom of the loss of what I may call the Alpha-energy 
   and makes a sharp break in the curve. The Beta and other energies dissipate 
   more slowly. Physiologists should make it their first duty to measure these 
   phenomena; for their study is evidently a direct line of research into the nature 
   of Life. The analogy between the living and complex molecules of the Uranium 
   group of inorganic and the Protoplasm group of organic elements is extremely 
   suggestive. The faculties of growth, action, self-recuperation, etc., must be 
   ascribed to similar properties in both cases; and as we have detected, measured 
   and partially explained radioactivity, it must be possible to contrive means 
   of doing the same for Life.</em></blockquote>
 Laboratory experiments in food-values seem to be almost worthless, for reasons 
 which we cannot here enter into; the general testimony of mankind appears a safer 
 guide. 
 <p> It would be unwise to condemn as irrational the practice of those savages 
   who tear the heart and liver from an adversary, and devour them while yet warm. 
   In any case it was the theory of the ancient Magicians, that any living being 
   is a storehouse of energy varying in quantity according to the size and health 
   of the animal, and in quality according to its mental and moral character. At 
   the death of the animal this energy is liberated suddenly. 
 </p><p> The animal should therefore be killed 
 </p><blockquote><em>It is a mistake to suppose that the victim is injured. On the 
   contrary, this is the most blessed and merciful of all deaths, for the elemental 
   spirit is directly built up into Godhead --- the exact goal of its efforts through 
   countless incarnations. On the other hand, the practice of torturing animals 
   to death in order to obtain the elemental as a slave is indefensible, utterly 
   black magic of the very worst kind, involving as it does a metaphysical basis 
   of dualism. There is, however, no objection to dualism or black magic when they 
   are properly understood. See the account of the Master Therion's Great Magical 
   Retirement by Lake Pasquaney, where he "crucified a toad in the Basilisk abode".</em></blockquote>
 within the Circle, or the Triangle, as the case may be, so that its energy cannot 
 escape. An animal should be selected whose nature accords with that of the ceremony 
 --- thus, by sacrificing a female lamb one would not obtain any appreciate quantity 
 of the fierce energy useful to a Magician who was invoking Mars. In such a case 
 a ram 
 <blockquote><em>A wolf would be still better in the case of Mars. See 777 for 
   the correspondences between various animals and the "32 Paths" of Nature.</em></blockquote>
 would be more suitable. And this ram should be virgin --- the whole potential 
 of its original total energy should not have been diminished in any way. 
 <blockquote><em>There is also the question of its magical freedom. Sexual intercourse 
   creates a link between its exponents, and therefore a responsibility.</em></blockquote>
 For the highest spiritual working one must accordingly choose that victim which 
 contains the greatest and purest force. A male child of perfect innocence and 
 high intelligence 
 <blockquote><em>It appears from the Magical Records of Frater Perdurabo that He 
   made this particular sacrifice on an average about 150 times every year between 
   1912 e.v. and 1928 e.v. Contrast J.K.Huyman's "La-Bas", where a perverted form 
   of Magic of an analogous order is described. 
   <p> "It is the sacrifice of oneself spiritually. And the intelligence and innocence 
     of that male child are the perfect understanding of the Magician, his one 
     aim, without lust of result. And male he must be, because what he sacrifices 
     is not the material blood, but his creative power." This initiated interpretation 
     of the texts was sent spontaneously by Soror I.W.E., for the sake of the younger 
     Brethren. 
   </p><p> WEH ADDENDA: When Crowley speaks of sacrificing a male child, his diaries 
     and other writings indicate that he thereby obfuscates the actual practice. 
     Crowley did this by diversion of the act of sexual intercourse and other sexual 
     actions. He considered contraception as human sacrifice. There is no indication 
     in any of his writings that he ever performed infanticide. In fact, Crowley 
     was even against abortion. 
   </p></em></blockquote>
 is the most satisfactory and suitable victim. 
 <p> For evocations it would be more convenient to place the blood of the victim 
   in the Triangle --- the idea being that the spirit might obtain from the blood 
   this subtle but physical substance which was the quintessence of its life in 
   such a manner as to enable it to take on a visible and tangible shape. 
 </p><blockquote><em>See Equinox (I, V. Supplement: Tenth Aethyr) for an Account of 
   an Operation where this was done. Magical phenomena of the creative order are 
   conceived and germinate in a peculiar thick velvet darkness, crimson, purple, 
   or deep blue, approximating black: as if it were said, In the body of Our Lady 
   of the Stars. 
   <p> See 777 for the correspondences of the various forces of Nature with drugs, 
     perfumes, etc. 
   </p></em></blockquote>
 Those magicians who abject to the use of blood have endeavored to replace it with 
 incense. For such a purpose the incense of Abramelin may be burnt in large quantities. 
 Dittany of Crete is also a valuable medium. Both these incenses are very catholic 
 in their nature, and suitable for almost any materialization. 
 <p> But the bloody sacrifice, though more dangerous, is more efficacious; and 
   for nearly all purposes human sacrifice is the best. The truly great Magician 
   will be able to use his own blood, or possibly that of a disciple, and that 
   without sacrificing the physical life irrevocably. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Such details, however, may safely be left to the good sense of 
   the Student. Experience here as elsewhere is the best teacher. In the Sacrifice 
   during Invocation, however, it may be said without fear of contradiction that 
   the death of the victim should coincide with the supreme invocation. 
   <p> WEH addenda: A sworn testimony by Crowley declares that he held actual human 
     sacrifice to physical death to be the most efficacious, but that he never 
     did such a thing. On the matter concerning death of the victim in invocation, 
     Crowley elsewhere enlarges that this is the ephemeral death of the Ego. 
   </p></em></blockquote>
 An example of this sacrifice is given in Chapter 44 of Liber 333. This Mass may 
 be recommended generally for daily practice. 
 <p> One last word on this subject. There is a Magical operation of maximum importance: 
   the Initiation of a New Aeon. When it becomes necessary to utter a Word, the 
   whole Planet must be bathed in blood. Before man is ready to accept the Law 
   of Thelema, the Great War must be fought. This Bloody Sacrifice is the critical 
   point of the World-Ceremony of the Proclamation of Horus, the Crowned and conquering 
   Child, as Lord of the Aeon. 
 </p><blockquote><em>Note: This paragraph was written in the summer of 1911 e.v., just 
   three years before its fulfilment.</em></blockquote>
 This whole matter is prophesied in the Book of the Law itself; let the student 
 take note, and enter the ranks of the Host of the Sun. 
 <h3 align="center">II</h3>
 There is another sacrifice with regard to which the Adepts have always maintained 
 the most profound secrecy. It is the supreme mystery of practical Magick. Its 
 name is the Formula of the Rosy Cross. In this case the victim is always --- in 
 a certain sense --- the Magician himself, and the sacrifice must coincide with 
 the utterance of the most sublime and secret name of the God whom he wishes to 
 invoke. 
 <p> Properly performed, it never fails of its effect. But it is difficult for 
   the beginner to do it satisfactorily, because it is a great effort for the mind 
   to remain concentrated upon the purpose of the ceremony. The overcoming of this 
   difficulty lends most powerful aid to the Magician. 
 </p><p> It is unwise for him to attempt it until he has received regular initiation 
   in the true 
 </p><blockquote><em>It is here desirable to warn the reader against the numerous false 
   orders which have impudently assumed the name of Rosicrucian. The Masonic Societas 
   Rosicruciana is honest and harmless; and makes no false pretences; if its members 
   happen as a rule to be pompous busy-bodies, enlarging the borders of their phylacteries, 
   and scrupulous about cleansing the outside of the cup and the platter; if the 
   masks of the Officers in their Mysteries suggest the Owl, the Cat, the Parrot, 
   and the Cuckoo, while the Robe of their Chief Magus is a Lion's Skin, that is 
   their affair. But those orders run by persons "claiming" to represent the True 
   Ancient Fraternity are common swindles. The representatives of the late S. L. 
   Mathers (Count McGregor) are the phosphorescence of the rotten wood of a branch 
   which was lopped off the tree at the end of the 19th century. Those of Papus 
   (Dr. Encausse), Stanislas de Guaita and Peladan, merit respect as serious, but 
   lack full knowledge and authority. The "Ordo Rosae Crucis" is a mass of ignorance 
   and falsehood, but this may be a deliberate device for masking itself. The test 
   of any Order is its attitude towards the Law of Thelema. The True Order presents 
   the True Symbols, but avoids attaching the True Name thereto; it is only when 
   the Postulant has taken irrevocable Oaths and been received formally, that he 
   discovers what Fraternity he has joined. If he have taken false symbols for 
   true, and find himself magically pledged to a gang of rascals, so much the worse 
   for him!</em></blockquote>
 Order of the Rosy Cross, and he must have taken the vows with the fullest comprehension 
 and experience of their meaning. It is also extremely desirable that he should 
 have attained an absolute degree of moral emancipation 
 <blockquote><em>This results from the full acceptance of the Law of THELEMA, persistently 
   put into practice.</em></blockquote>
 , and that purity of spirit which results from a perfect understanding both of 
 the differences and harmonies of the planes upon the Tree of Life. 
 <p> For this reason FRATER PERDURABO has never dared to use this formula in a 
   fully ceremonial manner, save once only, on an occasion of tremendous import, 
   when, indeed, it was not He that made the offering, but ONE in Him. For he perceived 
   a grave defect in his moral character which he has been able to overcome on 
   the intellectual plane, but not hitherto upon higher planes. Before the conclusion 
   of writing this book he will have done so. 
 </p><blockquote><em>P.S. With the happiest results. P.</em></blockquote>
 The practical details of the Bloody Sacrifice may be studied in various ethnological 
 manuals, but the general conclusions are summed up in Frazer's "Golden Bough", 
 which is strongly recommended to the reader. Actual ceremonial details likewise 
 may be left to experiment. The method of killing is practically uniform. The animal 
 should be stabbed to the heart, or its throat severed, in either case by the knife. 
 All other methods of killing are less efficacious; even in the case of Crucifixion 
 death is given by stabbing. 
 <blockquote><em>Yet one might devise methods of execution appropriate to the Weapons: 
   Stabbing or clubbing for the Lance or Wand, Drowning or poisoning for the Cup, 
   Beheading for the Sword, Crushing for the Disk, Burning for the Lamp, and so 
   forth.</em></blockquote>
 One may remark that warm-blooded animals only are used as victims: with two principal 
 exceptions. The first is the serpent, which is only used in a very special Ritual; 
 <blockquote><em>The Serpent is not really killed; it is seethed in an appropriate 
   vessel; and it issues in due season refreshed and modified, but still essentially 
   itself. The idea is the transmission of life and wisdom from a vehicle which 
   has fulfilled its formula to one capable of further extension. The development 
   of a wild fruit by repeated plantings in suitable soil is an analogous operation. 
   <p> WEH ADDENDA: The serpent is the phallus. The vessel and the seething are 
     likewise sub rosa. 
   </p></em></blockquote>
 the second the magical beetles of Liber Legis. (See Part IV.) 
 <p> One word of warning is perhaps necessary for the beginner. The victim must 
   be in perfect health --- or its energy may be as it were poisoned. It must also 
   not be too large: 
 </p><blockquote><em>The sacrifice (e.g.) of a bull is sufficient for a large number 
   of people; hence it is commonly made in public ceremonies, and in some initiations, 
   e.g. that of a King, who needs force for his whole kingdom. Or again, in the 
   Consecration of a Temple. 
   <p> See Lord Dunsany, "The Blessing of Pan" --- a noble and most notable prophecy 
     of Life's fair future. 
   </p></em></blockquote>
 the amount of energy disengaged is almost unimaginably great, and out of all anticipated 
 proportion to the strength of the animal. Consequently, the Magician may easily 
 be overwhelmed and obsessed by the force which he has let loose; it will then 
 probably manifest itself in its lowest and most objectionable form. The most intense 
 spirituality of purpose 
 <blockquote><em>This is a matter of concentration, with no ethical implication. 
   The danger is that one may get something which one does not want. This is "bad" 
   by definition. Nothing is in itself good or evil. The shields of the Sabines 
   which crushed Tarpeia were not murderous to them, but the contrary. Her criticism 
   of them was simply that they were what she did not want in her Operation.</em></blockquote>
 is absolutely essential to safety. 
 <p> In evocations the danger is not so great, as the Circle forms a protection; 
   but the circle in such a case must be protected, not only by the names of God 
   and the Invocations used at the same time, but by a long habit of successful 
   defence. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The habitual use of the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the Pentagram 
   (say, thrice daily) for months and years and constant assumption of the God-form 
   of Harpocrates (See Equinox, I, II and Liber 333, cap. XXV for both of these) 
   should make the "real circle", i.e. the Aura of the Magus, impregnable. 
   <p> This Aura should be clean-cut, resilient, radiant, iridescent, brilliant, 
     glittering. "A Soap-bubble of razor-steel, streaming with light from within" 
     is my first attempt at description; and is not bad, despite its incongruities: 
     P. 
   </p><p> "FRATER PERDURABO, on the one occasion on which I was able to see Him as 
     He really appears, was brighter than the Sun at noon. I fell instantly to 
     the floor in swoon which lasted several hours, during which I was initiated." 
     Soror A.'.. Cf. Rev. I, 12-17. 
   </p></em></blockquote>
 If you are easily disturbed or alarmed, or if you have not yet overcome the tendency 
 of the mind to wander, it is not advisable for you to perform the "Bloody Sacrifice". 
 <blockquote><em>The whole idea of the word Sacrifice, as commonly understood, 
   rests upon an error and superstition, and is unscientific, besides being metaphysically 
   false. The Law of Thelema has totally changed the Point of View as to this matter. 
   Unless you have thoroughly assimilated the Formula of Horus, it is absolutely 
   unsafe to meddle with this type of Magick. Let the young Magician reflect upon 
   the Conservation of Matter and of Energy.</em></blockquote>
 Yet it should not be forgotten that this, and that other art at which we have 
 dared darkly to hint, are the supreme formulae of Practical Magick. 
 <p> You are also likely to get into trouble over this chapter unless you truly 
   comprehend its meaning. 
 </p><blockquote><em>There is a traditional saying that whenever an Adept seems to 
   have made a straightforward, comprehensible statement, then is it most certain 
   that He means something entirely different. The Truth is nevertheless clearly 
   set forth in His Words: it is His simplicity that baffles the unworthy. I have 
   chosen the expressions in this Chapter in such a way that it is likely to mislead 
   those magicians who allow selfish interests to cloud their intelligence, but 
   to give useful hints to such as are bound by the proper Oaths to devote their 
   powers to legitimate ends. "...thou hast no right but to do thy will." "It is 
   a lie, this folly against self." The radical error of all uninitiates is that 
   they define "self" as irreconcilably opposed to "not-self." Each element of 
   oneself is, on the contrary, sterile and without meaning, until it fulfils itself, 
   by "love under will", in its counterpart in the Macrocosm. To separate oneself 
   from others is to destroy oneself; the way to realize and to extend oneself 
   is to lose that self --- its sense of separateness --- in the other. Thus: Child 
   plus food: this does not preserve one at the expense of the other; it "destroys" 
   or rather changes both in order to fulfil both in the result of the operation 
   --- a grown man. It is in fact impossible to preserve anything as it is by positive 
   action upon it. Its integrity demands inaction; and inaction, resistance to 
   change, is stagnation, death and dissolution due to the internal putrefaction 
   of the starved elements.</em></blockquote>
