 <h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER XVII<br>
   OF THE LICENSE TO DEPART</h2>
 <p> After a ceremony has reached its climax, anti-climax must inevitably follow. 
   But if the ceremony has been successful this anti-climax is merely formal. The 
   Magician should rest permanently on the higher plain to which he has aspired. 
 </p><blockquote><em>The rock-climber who relaxes on the face of the precipice falls 
   to earth; but once he has reached a safe ledge he may sit down.</em></blockquote>
 <p> The whole force of the operation should be absorbed; but there is almost certain 
   to be a residuum, since no operation is perfect: and (even if it were so) there 
   would be a number of things, sympathetic to the operation, attracted to the 
   Circle. These must be duly dispersed, or they will degenerate and become evil. 
   It is always easy to do this where invocations are concerned; the mere removal 
   of the strain imposed by the will of the magician will restore things to their 
   normal aspects, in accordance with the great law of inertia. In a badly-managed 
   evocation, however, this does not always obtain; the spirit may refuse to be 
   controlled, and may refuse to depart --- even after having sworn obedience. 
   In such a case extreme danger may arise. 
 </p><p> In the ordinary way, the Magician dismisses the spirit with these words: "And 
   now I say unto thee, depart in peace unto thine habitations and abodes --- and 
   may the blessing of the Highest be upon thee in the name of (here mention the 
   divine name suitable to the operation, or a Name appropriate to redeem that 
   spirit); and let there be peace between thee and me; and be thou very ready 
   to come, whensoever thou are invoked and called!" 
 </p><blockquote><em>It is usual to add "either by a word, or by a will, or by this 
   mighty Conjuration of Magick Art."</em></blockquote>
 <p> Should he fail to disappear immediately, it is a sign that there is something 
   very wrong. The Magician should immediately reconsecrate the Circle with the 
   utmost care. He should then repeat the dismissal; and if this does not suffice, 
   he should then perform the banishing ritual suitable to the nature of the spirit 
   and, if necessary, add conjurations to the same effect. In these circumstances, 
   or if anything else suspicious should occur, he should not be content with the 
   apparent disappearance of the spirit, who might easily make himself invisible 
   and lie in ambush to do the Magician a mischief when he stepped out of the Circle 
   --- or even months afterwards. 
 </p><p> Any symbol which has once definitely entered your environment with your own 
   consent is extremely dangerous; unless under absolute control. A man's friends 
   are more capable of working him harm than are strangers; and his greatest danger 
   lies in his own habits. 
 </p><p> Of course it is the very condition of progress to build up ideas into the 
   subconscious. The necessity of selection should therefore be obvious. 
 </p><p> True, there comes a time when all elements soever must be thus assimilated. 
   Samadhi is, by definition, that very process. But, from the point of view of 
   the young magician, there is a right way --- strait and difficult --- of performing 
   all this. One cannot too frequently repeat that what is lawful and proper to 
   one Path is alien to another. 
 </p><p> Immediately after the License to Depart, and the general closing up of the 
   work, it is necessary that the Magician should sit down and write up his magical 
   record. However much he may have been tired 
 </p><blockquote><em>He ought to be refreshed, more than after a full night's deep 
   sleep. This forms one test of his skill.</em></blockquote>
 <p> by the ceremony, he ought to force himself to do this until it becomes a habit. 
   Verily, it is better to fail in the magical ceremony than to fail in writing 
   down an accurate record of it. One need not doubt the propriety of this remark. 
   Even if one is eaten alive by Malkah be-Tarshishim ve-Ruachoth ha-Schehalim, 
   it does not matter very much, for it is over so very quickly. But the record 
   of the transactions is otherwise important. Nobody cares about Duncan having 
   been murdered by Macbeth. It is only one of a number of similar murders. But 
   Shakespeare's account of the incident is a unique treasure of mankind. And, 
   apart from the question of the value to others, there is that of the value to 
   the magician himself. The record of the magician is his best asset. 
 </p><p> It is as foolish to do Magick without method, as if it were anything else. 
   To do Magick without keeping a record is like trying to run a business without 
   book-keeping. There are a great many people who quite misunderstand the nature 
   of Magick. They have an idea that it is something vague and unreal, instead 
   of being, as it is, a direct means of coming into contact with reality. It is 
   these people who pay themselves with phrases, who are always using long words 
   with no definite connotation, who plaster themselves with pompous titles and 
   decorations which mean nothing whatever. With such people we have nothing to 
   do. But to those who seek reality the Key of Magick is offered, and they are 
   hereby warned that the key to the treasure-house is no good without the combination; 
   and the combination is the magical record. 
 </p><p> From one point of view, magical progress actually consists in deciphering 
   one's own record. 
 </p><blockquote><em>As one is a Star in the Body of Nuith, every successive incarnation 
   is a Veil, and the acquisition of the Magical Memory a gradual Unveiling of 
   that Star, of that God.</em></blockquote>
 <p> For this reason it is the most important thing to do, on strictly magical 
   grounds. But apart from this, it is absolutely essential that the record should 
   be clear, full and concise, because it is only by such a record that your teacher 
   can judge how it is best to help you. Your magical teacher has something else 
   to do besides running around after you all the time, and the most important 
   of all his functions is that of auditor. Now, if you call in an auditor to investigate 
   a business, and when he asks for the books you tell him that you have not thought 
   it worth while to keep any, you need not be surprised if he thinks you every 
   kind of an ass. 
 </p><p> It is --- at least, it was --- perfectly incredible to THE MASTER THERION 
   that people who exhibit ordinary common sense in the other affairs of life should 
   lose it completely when they tackle Magick. It goes far to justify the belief 
   of the semi-educated that Magick is rather a crazy affair after all. However, 
   there are none of these half-baked lunatics connected with the A.'. A.'., because 
   the necessity for hard work, for passing examinations at stated intervals, and 
   for keeping an intelligible account of what they are doing, frightens away the 
   unintelligent, idle and hysterical. 
 </p><p> There are numerous models of magical and mystical records to be found in the 
   various numbers of the "Equinox", and the student will have no difficulty in 
   acquiring the necessary technique, if he be diligent in practice.</p></body>
