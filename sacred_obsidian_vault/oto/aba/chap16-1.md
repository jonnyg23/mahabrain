 <h2 class="title" align="center">CHAPTER XVI<br>
   <em>(Part I)</em><br>
   OF THE OATH</h2>
 <p> The third operation in any magical ceremony is the oath or proclamation. The 
   Magician, armed and ready, stands in the centre of the Circle, and strikes once 
   upon the bell as if to call the attention of the Universe. He then declares 
   "who he is", reciting his magical history by the proclamation of the grades 
   which he has attained, giving the signs and words of those grades. 
 </p><blockquote><em>This is not merely to prove himself a person in authority. It 
   is to trace the chain of causes that have let to the present position, so that 
   the operation is seen as karma.</em></blockquote>
 <p> He then states the purpose of the ceremony, and proves that it is necessary 
   to perform it and to succeed in its performance. He then takes an oath before 
   the Lord of the Universe (not before the particular Lord whom he is invoking) 
   as if to call Him to witness to the act. He swears solemnly that he will perform 
   it --- that nothing shall prevent him from performing it --- that he will not 
   leave the operation until it is successfully performed --- and once again he 
   strikes upon the bell. 
 </p><p> Yet, having demonstrated himself in that position at once infinitely lofty 
   and infinitely unimportant, the instrument of destiny, he balances this by the 
   "Confession", in which there is again an infinite exaltation harmonised with 
   an infinite humility. He admits himself to be a weak human being humbly aspiring 
   to something higher; a creature of circumstance utterly dependent --- even for 
   the breath of life --- upon a series of fortunate accidents. He makes this confession 
   prostrate 
 </p><blockquote><em>Compare the remarks in a previous chapter. But this is a particular 
   case. We leave its justification as a problem.</em></blockquote>
 <p> before the altar in agony and bloody sweat. He trembles at the thought of 
   the operation which he has dared to undertake, saying, "Father, if it be Thy 
   Will, let this cup pass from me! Nevertheless not my will but Thine be done!" 
 </p><blockquote><em>Of course this is for the beginner. As soon as it is assimilated 
   as true, he will say: "My will which is thine be done!" And ultimately no more 
   distinguish "mine" from "thine". A sympathetic change of gesture will accompany 
   the mental change.</em></blockquote>
 <p> The dread answer comes that It Must Be, and this answer so fortifies him with 
   holy zeal that it will seem to him as if he were raised by divine hands from 
   that prostrate position; with a thrill of holy exaltation he renews joyfully 
   the Oath, feeling himself once again no longer the man but the Magician, yet 
   not merely the Magician, but the chosen and appointed person to accomplish a 
   task which, however apparently unimportant, is yet an integral part of universal 
   destiny, so that if it were not accomplished the Kingdom of Heaven would be 
   burst in pieces. 
 </p><p> He is now ready to commence the invocations. He consequently pauses to cast 
   a last glance around the Temple to assure himself of the perfect readiness of 
   all things necessary, and to light the incense. 
 </p><hr>
 <p> The Oath is the foundation of all Work in Magick, as it is an affirmation 
   of the Will. An Oath binds the Magician for ever. In Part II of Book 4 something 
   has already been said on this subject; but its importance deserves some further 
   elaboration. Thus, should one, loving a woman, make a spell to compel her embraces, 
   and tiring of her a little later, evoke Zazel to kill her; he will find that 
   the implications of his former Oath conflict with those proper to invoke the 
   Unity of the Godhead of Saturn. Zazel will refuse to obey him in the case of 
   the woman whom he has sworn that he loves. To this some may object that, since 
   all acts are magical, every man who loves a woman implicitly takes an Oath of 
   love, and therefore would never be able to murder her later, as we find to be 
   the not uncommon case. The explanation is as follows. It is perfectly true that 
   when Bill Sykes desires to possess Nancy, he does in fact evoke a spirit of 
   the nature of Venus, constraining him by his Oath of Love (and by his magical 
   power as a man) to bring him the girl. So also, when he wants to kill her, he 
   evokes a Martial or Saturnian spirit, with an Oath of hate. But these are not 
   pure planetary spirits, moving in well-defined spheres by rigidly righteous 
   laws. They are gross concretions of confused impulses, "incapable of understanding 
   the nature of an oath". They are also such that the idea of murder is nowise 
   offensive to the Spirit of Love. 
 </p><p> It is indeed the criterion of spiritual "caste" that conflicting elements 
   should not coexist in the same consciousness. The psalm-singing Puritan who 
   persecutes publicans, and secretly soaks himself in fire-water; the bewhiskered 
   philanthropist in broadcloth who swindles his customers and sweats his employees: 
   these men must not be regarded as single-minded scoundrels, whose use of religion 
   and respectability to cloke their villainies is a deliberate disguise dictated 
   by their criminal cunning. Far from it, they are only too sincere in their "virtues"; 
   their terror of death and of supernatural vengeance is genuine; it proceeds 
   from a section of themselves which is in irreconcilable conflict with their 
   rascality. Neither side can conciliate, suppress, or ignore the other; yet each 
   is so craven as to endure its enemy's presence. Such men are therefore without 
   pure principles; they excuse themselves for every dirty trick that turns to 
   their apparent advantage. 
 </p><p> The first step of the Aspirant toward the Gate of Initiation tells him that 
   purity --- unity of purpose --- is essential above all else. "Do what thou Wilt" 
   strikes on him, a ray of fierce white flame consuming all that is not utterly 
   God. Very soon he is aware that he cannot consciously contradict himself. He 
   develops a subtle sense which warns him that two trains of thought which he 
   had never conceived as connected are incompatible. Yet deeper drives "Do what 
   thou wilt"; subconscious oppositions are evoked to visible appearance. The secret 
   sanctuaries of the soul are cleansed. "Do What thou Wilt" purges his every part. 
   He has become One, one only. His Will is consequently released from the interference 
   of internal opposition, and he is a Master of Magick. But for that very reason 
   he is now utterly impotent to achieve anything that is not in absolute accordance 
   with his Original Oath, with his True Will, by virtue whereof he incarnated 
   as a man. With Bill Sykes love and murder are not mutually exclusive, as they 
   are with King Arthur. The higher the type of man, the more sensitive he becomes; 
   so that the noblest love divines intuitively when a careless word or gesture 
   may wound, and, vigilant, shuns them as being of the family of murder. In Magick, 
   likewise, the Adept who is sworn to attain to the Knowledge and Conversation 
   of his Holy Guardian Angel may in his grosser days have been expert as a Healer, 
   to find that he is now incapable of any such work. He will probably be puzzled, 
   and wonder whether he has lost all his power. Yet the cause may be no more than 
   that the Wisdom of his Angel depreciates the interference of ignorant kindliness 
   with diseases which may have been sent to the sufferer for a purpose profoundly 
   important to his welfare. 
 </p><p> In the case of THE MASTER THERION, he had originally the capacity for all 
   classes of Orgia. In the beginning, He cured the sick, bewitched the obstinate, 
   allured the seductive, routed the aggressive, made himself invisible, and generally 
   behaved like a Young-Man-About-town on every possible plane. He would afflict 
   one vampire with a Sending of Cats, and appoint another his private Enchantress, 
   neither aware of any moral oxymoron, nor hampered by the implicit incongruity 
   of his oaths. 
 </p><p> But as He advanced in Adeptship, this coltishness found its mouth bitted; 
   as soon as He took serious Oaths and was admitted to the Order which we name 
   not, those Oaths prevented him using His powers as playthings. Trifling operations, 
   such as He once could do with a turn of the wrist, became impossible to the 
   most persistent endeavour. It was many years before He understood the cause 
   of this. But little by little He became so absorbed in the Work of His true 
   Will that it no longer occurred to Him to indulge in capricious amusements. 
 </p><p> Yet even at this hour, though He be verily a Magus of A.'. A.'., though His 
   Word be the Word of the Aeon, though He be the Beast 666, the Lord of the Scarlet 
   Woman "in whom is all power given", there are still certain Orgia beyond Him 
   to perform, because to do so would be to affirm what He hath denied in those 
   Oaths by whose virtue He is That He is. This is the case, even when the spirit 
   of such Orgia is fully consonant with His Will. The literal sense of His original 
   Oath insists that it shall be respected. 
 </p><p> The case offers two instances of this principle. FRATER PERDURABO specifically 
   swore that he would renounce His personal possessions to the last penny; also 
   that He would allow no human affection to hinder Him. These terms were accepted; 
   He was granted infinitely more than He had imagined possible to an incarnated 
   Man. On the other hand, the price offered by Him was exacted as strictly as 
   if it had been stipulated by Shylock. Every treasure that he had on earth was 
   taken away, and that, usually, in so brutal or cruel a manner as to make the 
   loss itself the least part of the pang. Every human affection that He had in 
   His heart --- and that heart aches for Love as few hearts can ever conceive 
   --- was torn out and trampled with such infernal ingenuity in intensifying torture 
   that His endurance is beyond belief. Inexplicable are the atrocities which accompanied 
   every step in His Initiation! Death dragged away His children with slow savagery; 
   the women He loved drank themselves into delirium and dementia before His eyes, 
   or repaid His passionate devotion with toad-cold treachery at the moment when 
   long years of loyalty had tempted Him to trust them. His friend, that bore the 
   bag, stole that which was put therein, and betrayed his Master as thoroughly 
   as he was able. At the first distant rumour that the Pharisees were out, his 
   disciples "all forsook Him and fled". His mother nailed Him with her own hands 
   to the cross, and reviled Him as nine years He hung thereupon. 
 </p><p> Now, having endured to the end, being Master of Magick, He is mighty to Work 
   His true Will; which Will is, to establish on Earth His Word, the Law of Thelema. 
   He hath none other Will than this; so all that He doth is unto this end. All 
   His Orgia bear fruit; what was the work of a month when He was a full Major 
   Adept is to day wrought in a few minutes by the Words of Will, uttered with 
   the right vibrations into the prepared Ear. 
 </p><p> But neither by the natural use of His abilities, though they have made Him 
   famous through the whole world, nor by the utmost might of his Magick, is He 
   able to acquire material wealth beyond the minimum necessary to keep Him alive 
   and at work. It is in vain that He protests that not He but the Work is in need 
   of money; He is barred by the strict letter of His Oath to give all that He 
   hath for His magical Attainment. 
 </p><p> Yet more awful is the doom that He hath invoked upon Himself in renouncing 
   His right as a man to enjoy the Love of those whom He loves with passion so 
   selfless, so pure, and so intense in return for the power so to love Mankind 
   that He be chosen to utter the Word of the Aeon for their sake, His reward universal 
   abhorrence, bodily torment, mental despair, and moral paralysis. 
 </p><p> Yet He, who hath power over Death, with breath to call back health, with a 
   touch to beckon life, He must watch His own child waste away month by month, 
   aware that His Art may not anywise avail, who hath sold the signet ring of his 
   personal profit to buy him a plain gold band for the felon finger of his bride, 
   that worn widow, the World!</p></body>
