 <em>In the above, the Hebrew letters are in the upper left corner of each box, 
 except those of the right column of ...MERCURII... which are in the upper right 
 corner of each box. 
 <p> Next, here is a description of the content of each box. This is necessarily 
   incomplete in that some of the sigils are too obscure to admit a description. 
 </p><p> The boxes of ...MERCURII..., mostly reflecting Tarot correspondences to the 
   Hebrew letters with some astrological and Thelemic used as well: 
 </p><p> HB:Aleph : This is a widdershins swastika (nazi shaped) of thin lines with 
   all line elements parallel to the sides of the box. There is a small circle 
   about the central intersection. There are four dots in symmetric array, one 
   in the center of each space defined by an arm of the swastika. Greek letters 
   in capitals appear at the ends of the arms of the swastika, oriented toward 
   the outside. Counterclockwise from lower right: Tau, Alpha, Rho, Omega. (The 
   suggestion is that Aleph is swastika shaped and spins out TARO). 
 </p><p> HB:Bet : This is a composition of three separate forms. The central one is 
   a vertical wand with a three pointed crown at top. To the right is a simple 
   vesica. To the left is a Shiva-lingam consisting of a round top vertical shaft 
   on a flat base. (Tools of the Magus). 
 </p><p> HB:Gemel : This sigil cannot be fully described. It is composed of two shield 
   forms in upper right and left with lines depending. The two forms are separate. 
   The shield in upper left is hatched with nearly horizontal lines, descending 
   slightly toward right. This shield has a slightly concave top with extension 
   to the upper left and is completed by two convex sides which join in a downward 
   point below. The line from the left shield issues from the upper right side 
   as a short upward diagonal, curves down in a arch to the left, recurves down 
   to the right with a curve issuing convexly upward toward the lower right base 
   of the shield while the principle line continues as a lesser curve toward to 
   bottom of the box --- giving a "y" shape in the lower part of this line. The 
   shield in upper right is hatched with nearly vertical lines, deviating slightly 
   downward to left. It is defined by three curved sides, a concave at top slightly 
   downward to the right, an elbow curve forming the left and bottom edges at slight 
   angles in parallel and at right angles to the hatching and a curved line to 
   form the right side nearly parallel to the left but extending below the shield. 
   The line associated issues from the left side symmetrically to the line of the 
   other shield, but ends below in horizontal elipsoidal spindle, point to left, 
   below the shield instead of a fork as did the other. (Possibly male and female 
   or female pregnant and barren). 
 </p><p> HB:Dalet : This sigil is composed of five elements. There are two off vertical 
   lines curving inward from the upper quarters of the box to frame the sides. 
   In the upper center to center is a figure rather like a radish: The bulb has 
   a small line extending below and has inner semicircles touching the right and 
   left parts of the circular bulb, at the inner top of the bulb is a rectangle 
   pierced by a point that flares up to right and left to form a sort of confine 
   for what would be the foliage on the "radish", this last portion contains an 
   array of ten dots forming an inverted tetractys. The remaining two elements 
   are a "T" to the left below of the "raddish" and an isosceles triangle with 
   point up to the right. (Probably vulvicular symbolism). 
 </p><p> HB:Vau : This figure is a circular ring, right eye of Horus in center, thirteen 
   clockwise hooked flames about the outer rim. In a circular pattern concentric 
   and inside the ring are following characters from top clockwise: V, infinity, 
   V, 3, V, 10, V, 8, V, O. (Plays on unity of V.V.V.V.V. name and other Thelemic 
   elements). 
 </p><p> HB:Heh : This is a simple upright pentagram formed of solid lines. In the 
   bays formed by the points with each other are the following symbols, clockwise 
   from upper right: Mercury, A, Sulfur, I, Salt. (Out of alphabetic sequence with 
   the preceeding, may be wrong letters. It appears to be an epitome of five with 
   emphasis on alchemical aspects.). 
 </p><p> HB:Zain : This sigil is composed of four elements. At top center is a crescent 
   with horns upward crossed by a vertical arrow, point down and fledging at top. 
   Beneath this is a lineal upright pentagram with five lines issuing radially 
   out from the intersections of the points. To the left below is a Neter sign 
   like a golf club with head to the left on a vertical shaft, three dots vertically 
   below the head. The last element is to the right, the same as the one just described 
   but the head is to the bottom below the dots and points to the right. (Simple 
   diagram of Lover's Trump). 
 </p><p> HB:Chet : This sigil is a solid black pentagram of narrow points, one point 
   to top and the intersections of the points have issuing wavy rays on outward 
   radials. (Possibly the idea of contained force associated to Cancer and the 
   Chariot in the Royal Arch). 
 </p><p> HB:Tet : This sigil is chiefly a large equilateral triangle with point upward, 
   inside it and sharing the same base and axis is a smaller equilateral triangle. 
   Between the upper apexes of the two triangles is a circle with a dot in center 
   (sun symbol). Midway on the excluded space between the sides of the two triangles 
   on left and right are two small shapes that may be flowers. To the left of the 
   larger top apex is a circle dot (sun) and to the right is a Leo symbol. Within 
   the smaller triangle is a pattern of 
 </p><pre>Roman numerals giving the value 666: D
 
                                     C L
 
                                    X V I. (Sun in Leo and 666).</pre>
 <p> HB:Yod : This sigil is a traditional "Aladin's lamp" occupying the bottom 
   half of the box, handle to left and wick spout to right. A single vertical line 
   emerges from the wick hole and terminates in a cross with serifs on its three 
   end points. (Lamp of the Hermit). 
 </p><p> HB:Koph : This is a circle with one vertical diameter and two others dividing 
   the interior space into six equal parts. Greek capital letters appear at top: 
   Sigma; at lower right, Tau; and at lower left, Rho. (Wheel of Fortune with letters 
   for the three figures). 
 </p><p> HB:Lamed : This sigil is based upon a scrolled "U" shape. This is slightly 
   more open at the top than normal and has two tight spiral loops outward and 
   down at the line ends. There is a dot below. Immediately above the lower dip 
   and within is a lineal trident (a "Y" with continuation of the vertical. Above 
   this are three horizontal dots. Above the dots is a simple figure of a horizontal 
   line with two verticals down at its ends and a single vertical across its center. 
   This last vertical element terminates above the upper part of the "U" in a feather 
   of Maat with plume to the right. (Scales of Justice). 
 </p><p> HB:Mem : This sigil is composed of a hollow, double walled, equilateral triangle 
   with a cross issuing from its apex, the cross being terminated on the three 
   open ends by serifs. The upper arm of this cross touches a horizontal line. 
   This horizontal line proceeds to the right, makes a right angle and drops in 
   a vertical to terminate in another serifed cross at the lower right of the box. 
   (Simply a Hanged Man on a gibbet with the inverted Sulfur symbol for the figure). 
 </p><p> HB:Nun : This sigil has a rectangle below with the letters LVX inside. Above 
   this are the Roman numerals CXX. Above this is an inverted "V" of two straight 
   lines having small circles at the ends of the lines and at the junction. (Possibly 
   refers to the R+C mystery of the tomb of Fr. C.R.). 
 </p><p> HB:Samekh : This Sigil is composed of two shapes like a rectangle cut in half 
   horizontally and separated vertically. The lower elongate "U" has a vertical 
   rising a short distance from its base, and all three verticals terminate above 
   in three-serif crosses. The portion above is the same inverted except that the 
   vertical continues both above and below the figure, the lower portion ending 
   in an arrow head and the upper in a 3- serif cross. The letters QST appear across 
   the shaft of the arrow. (This is an allusion to Sagittarius and the rainbow 
   paths on the Tree of Life). 
 </p><p> HB:Ayin : This is a circle with ocular mark at top, pierced from below by 
   a nail. The nail ends in two round bulbs below. There is a Sigma to the left 
   of the base and an Eta to the right. (Possibly a goat in coitus). 
 </p><p> HB:Peh : Below is a large letter Ayin. Immediately above this is a lineal 
   letter "Y". Above this is a small circle with a short line dependent below, 
   essentially the antique Greek letter Qopa. (Looks like a stick figure about 
   to fall into a Hell-mouth). 
 </p><p> HB:Tzaddi : The basic figure is a deosil swastika. This is contained by an 
   open box shape formed by four coils at top, bottom and sides. Within the chambers 
   so created are letters and a shape. Clockwise from upper left: The shape is 
   the sword of ten points on the Tree of Life; O; N; B. 
 </p><p> HB:Qof : The central motif is an inverted "Y" shape of equal angles. Below 
   this is an upright equilateral triangle. Above is a crescent moon with horns 
   pointing right. To either side and near center are two mirrored patterns. The 
   one on the left looks like a Theban "k" with a Nun to its right, all on a slope 
   toward the lower left. The pattern on the right is a mirror reversal. (Possibly 
   a stylized Moon Trump). 
 </p><p> HB:Resh : The sigil is compound. Above is a six-pointed star, one point up, 
   the points slender and the center formed by a "happy face". Below is a crescent 
   with horns upward. The numbers 6 and 9 are dependent from the lower left and 
   right points of the star. Three vertical dots descend from these on either side 
   to pass just beyond the horns of the crescent. There are two Netteru symbols 
   just inside these columns of dots, the one on the left having its head at top 
   and to the right, the one on the right having its head at bottom to the left, 
   within the hollow of the horns of the crescent. (This is generally modeled on 
   a type of the Sun Trump, with indications of mutual oral intercourse.) 
 </p><p> HB:Shin : This is a perspective drawing of a four sided pyramid, sides shaded 
   and opening to the lower right as a tiny white rectangle at the base. There 
   is a horizontally transverse rectangular chamber on the lower-left to upper 
   right diagonal visible within the pyramid. (Clearly inspired by the tomb symbolism 
   of the Judgment Trump). 
 </p><p> HB:Taw : In the elongated box at the bottom of the table is a connected design. 
   To the left is a thick numeral "1", sans-serif. To the right is a thick ring 
   or zero. These are connected across the bottom by a squiggle which forms a vertical 
   loop in center before continuing on. (Possible the 1 and 0 Thelemic motif). 
 </p><p> The boxes of ...CARCERORUM QLIPHOTH..., mostly reflecting Tarot correspondences 
   to the Hebrew letters with some astrological and Thelemic used as well. Most 
   of these are too irregular in shape to permit exact description: 
 </p><p> HB:Aleph : This is an open interior form shaped like an "E" made of string 
   with an extension of the common loop to the left below. The thing has hair up 
   the back and part way along the upper arm. There are needle teeth below on the 
   upper arm and above on the middle arm. The general effect is like a grotesque 
   head, virtually all mouth. 
 </p><p> HB:Bet : This is a complex and decorative device. It is delineated on left 
   and right by two curved swords, they are straight and curve in only at the top, 
   cross hilted with serifs at bottom. There is an "equals" sign immediately below 
   each hilt. Between the points at top is a thin crescent, horns up. A large and 
   flat dish-shaped crescent, points up is at bottom, the lower arc broken by two 
   pairs of very short transverse lines to right and left. There is a dot asymmetrically 
   below the lower crescent to the left (possibly a printing fault). There is a 
   small wiggling crescent shaped line like a smiling mouth above this. Three wavy 
   lines are vertical on and to either side of center. Two dots like eyes complete 
   the sigil between the upper ends of these lines. The whole figure is like a 
   face emerging from smoke out of a bowl and between the two "swords". 
 </p><p> HB:Gemel : This composite is a face. The eyes are two dots with small curved 
   brows over them from the outside and not passing the center. The nose is a simple 
   crosshilted sword, point to top. There is an oval with ocular ellipse inside 
   at top for the mouth and a thin solid crescent for the chin. The cheeks are 
   set forth by inward curving lines crowned at top by tiny outward tending, tiny 
   curved clefts. 
 </p><p> HB:Dalet : The basic figure is a vertical and flatly compressed "S" shape 
   to left, a similar twig extending across that and past center at top. Below 
   are three elongate drops with bulb to right forming a lower base with the end 
   of the upright. Dependent on a short line from top is a water triangle with 
   a fern-like stalk of three curls issuing at the top right base and drooping 
   to the right. 
 </p><p> HB:Heh : Two dot eyes beneath harry eyebrows. A plump "U" shape below that 
   for a nose. A dot below that for a mouth. A beard formed of three crosses, two 
   at cheeks and one at bottom and two squiggles between them. 
 </p><p> HB:Vau : One vertical line diverging in two angle lines like a "Y" at top. 
   This is crossed by a horizontal line at center and terminates below in a small 
   cross. Just above the termination is a short horizontal line which diverges 
   in two short diagonals ending below in crosses. The upper four line ends have 
   the letter Yod as their terminators. 
 </p><p> HB:Zain : A vertical forked stick in center, fork small at bottom. A curved 
   arc across the lower quarter, ends down and terminating in linear shapes like 
   earphones with the openings to the right. At an angle over the top of the stick 
   a little below the upper end is a deep, thin, hollow crescent, horns up, the 
   left higher. This crescent terminates on the right in a very small crescent, 
   horns up to right, and is crossed by a short line just a bit below that. The 
   short line ends in diverging thin crescents. 
 </p><p> HB:Chet : This is a complex doodle. There is a squiggle beginning in the upper 
   left area, forming somewhat of a tail for the head and neck of a camel extending 
   across the center of the box. A simple line curves down from the base of the 
   neck and attaches to the feet of a horizontal face-down human form at bottom. 
 </p><p> HB:Tet : This is an odd sort of thing rather reminiscent of one or two of 
   the elongate Goetic sigils. It has a harry face like that of a dog at the left, 
   ears with the eyes dots and the nose and mouth represented by a straight line 
   with a button at top. A flat dish on its side issues from this to form the body. 
   There are four feet below represented by upright vesicas in a line, these being 
   connected to the body by curved lines like knees angled to the left. There is 
   a tail in the form of a curved line that issues from the far right end, curves 
   above the body in parallel, makes a tight bend and curves back above that to 
   trail off slightly upward at the very end. 
 </p><p> HB:Ayin : This is a shape like that of the sigils of the Archangels. It is 
   lineal, starts on the left center in curved line that comes up toward the center 
   above. This bends back and down from a cusp in a tight little curve, then up 
   again in a cusp and a slightly wider down curve, up to a cusp and then straight 
   down for a short distance, small circular loop and curve up to right in another 
   small circular loop. Then horizontal back to the left just through the top edge 
   of the first loop and drooping down to end in a serif cross. 
 </p><p> HB:Koph : Top center, a circle with horns at top and a cross of vertical and 
   horizontal diameters inside. Below this a radial extends downward for a short 
   distance and then breaks up into three flat "S" curves ended in simple loose 
   crosses. 
 </p><p> HB:Lamed : Composite figure: Simple Libra type balances to left and above, 
   no support. The lower pan hangs at an angle toward the center. The bar is diagonal 
   in the upper left quarter of the box. The upper pan is blown horizontal. There 
   is a form like a hockey stick angled from the lower left toward the center with 
   the head vertical. A human head tops this, looking to the right. A horizontal 
   line crosses the stick head below the human one, the right end terminating in 
   a circle with a black and sinuous Yod inside. The left takes a angle down and 
   touches the lower balance pan. In the lower right is a sword, angled up toward 
   the serif-cross hilt to the right. 
 </p><p> HB:Mem : This is a storm cloud with eyes and a sort of mouth. It is very flat 
   and five shapes like icicles hang from it to the left of center. The letters 
   N V H are vertical below the cloud and to the right of the icicle shapes. There 
   is a downward pointed fledged arrow parallel and to the right of the letters. 
 </p><p> HB:Nun : Left center is an "X" of two crossed sticks with a flower in center. 
   Just above and to the right is the point of a scythe blade, arcing up to above 
   top center and beyond before it curves down in a lineal handle ending below 
   center in a serif-cross hilt. A stylized and crowned corpse to right holds this 
   in right hand (shown as a short of brush). The head is a simplified death head 
   canted to the right. The neck is narrow, The body and left arm look like a plucked 
   chicken with a wishbone for a tail. 
 </p><p> HB:Samekh : Difficult to describe. The lower center is misshapen cross of 
   Malta ending in a blunt pestle below. A narrow isosceles triangle touches to 
   top of this from above with its point. There is a pair of tiny golf-club shapes 
   at the top base of the triangle, heads turned outward. This complex depends 
   from a line that diverges symmetrically to either side at top. This line is 
   wavy and reaches down on the left to touch the bristle end of a shape like a 
   shaving brush. The line on the right forms a vertical word: SKRL, and continues 
   down and below the bottom in crumpled waves to connect up the to handle of the 
   "brush". 
 </p><p> HB:Ayin : Odd shapes. There is a figure like an apple with two tiny leaves 
   to left and top. A face is on this with curves for shut eyes and a downward 
   curve for a mouth (nose?). Below this is the letter "B". Issuing to the right 
   from the mouth point is a hollow lineal figure of curved lines, two lobes at 
   top, a letter "K" below that, the lower lobe extended in a shaft toward the 
   left center bottom and a rounded end at the bottom. The letter "R" is to the 
   right, a little below midway of this shaft. The letter "N" is beneath the shaft 
   end. 
 </p><p> HB:Peh : This is a barten with letters. The top has four crennels, simply, 
   with the letter "D" in air above. The upper walls drop from the end crennels, 
   right angle outward and then drop to the base. The base continues the walls 
   with another small angle outward and a drop to a horizontal line across the 
   bottom and extending slightly beyond each wall. There is a flattened rectangle 
   within this base. An inverted "U" with serifs forms the door above this rectangle, 
   and there is an inverted Latin cross hanging from the top inside that. Two windows 
   complete the structure, inverted "U" shaped with flats cutting off the bottoms 
   and inverted Latin Crosses acting to divide them are situated in the upper section 
   and just past the first outward bends. The upper walls are flanked to left by 
   "N" and to right by "V". The lower walls are flanked to left by "V" and to the 
   right by "S". The base is flanked on the left by "M" and the right by "D". The 
   word "SUE" is beneath the base. 
 </p><p> HB:Tzaddi : This is one image. The lower part is a face, natural chin and 
   sides smoothly going up until the ears appear as short laps to either side. 
   Above this are two tapering lines, curved from below the ears and ascending 
   in slight convergence to the top half of the image, about twice the height of 
   the face above the chin. At this point there is a structure composed of two 
   semicircles. The arcs are broken by vertical lines with a gap between in the 
   lower part. In the upper part the arcs are interrupted by vertical elipsoid 
   with a smaller horizontal elipsoid at top. The details of the face itself are 
   a natural mouth, a little "U" shaped nose, two dots for eyes, brows meeting 
   in a third arch. 
 </p><p> HB:Qof : Three black crescents, horns down, are in vertical array in the center. 
   They dwindle from the largest on top to a smaller near the bottom. Below the 
   lowest of these is a vesica on its side. There is a fan of lines extending down 
   from the upper arc of the vesica, creating an image a bit like a shell. To the 
   right of this shell a series of seven crescents arcs upward to the right and 
   comes a bit back toward the center at top. These crescents have horns downward 
   at various angles to accommodate the curve, and the size increases slightly 
   as they rise. A similar curve of crescents proceeds upward and to the left from 
   just beyond the left side of the shell. These are more strongly incurved at 
   top and reach nearly to the upper border of the box. There are twelve in this 
   curve, with the ones near the shell being about half the size of those ending 
   the curve near the upper limit, waxing in overall size as they go up. 
 </p><p> HB:Resh : There are four elements to the sigil. In the center above is a black 
   disk, the lower edge of it has a slender white crescent. Below this is a small 
   horned circle with a dot in center. A line descends vertically from this small 
   circle. A short horizontal bar crosses this line near the bottom and the ends 
   of this bar drop verticals just short of the termination level of the main vertical 
   line. Neteru are on either side, the one on the left has the head at top left, 
   that on the right has its head at top right. 
 </p><p> HB:Shin : This is a face melded into an exploded drawing of a rectangular 
   box. The top rectangle has "NON" inside. The next rectangle has small rectangular 
   "ears" to either side and "PAT" inside. The next down rectangle has "EBO" inside. 
   The bottom contiguous rectangle has a set of lips and a lower lip fringe beard. 
   To the left and right of the upper rectangle are two angled dashes for eyes 
   and beyond them two slight curved lines for brows. 
 </p><p> HB:Taw : This is a strange sigil. From the right: Two large lower case letter 
   "i"'s, sansserf. From near the bottom of the left most is a horizontal squiggle 
   of three vertical loops, then a curve to vertical and another horizontal squiggle 
   of five downward loops, the last loop of this starts an arched squiggle up to 
   the top of the next structure. The next structure is a vertical bar, from the 
   bottom of which a curved squiggle arches right and about, crossing the second 
   horizontal squiggle and reaching back over the left top to the upper end of 
   a second parallel bar. From the bottom of this second bar a squiggle diagonals 
   up about half the height of the bar to the left, continuing as a horizontal 
   squiggle into the underside of the last element in the sigil. This element loops 
   like a simplified drawing of a turtle, head downward and belly toward left. 
   Back spotted in the pattern of Acquisitio and only two legs showing. This last 
   could also be a sheep, such is the simplicity of the drawing.}

 0. A, the heart of IAO, dwelleth in ecstasy in the secret place of the thunders. 
 Between Asar and Asi he abideth in joy. 
 <ol>
   <li> The lightnings increased and the Lord Tahuti stood forth. The Voice came 
     from the Silence. Then the One ran and returned. 
   </li><li> Now hath Nuit veiled herself, that she may open the gate of her sister. 
   </li><li> The Virgin of God is enthroned upon an oyster-shell; she is like a pearl, 
     and seeketh Seventy to her Four. In her heart is Hadit the invisible glory. 
   </li><li> Now riseth Ra-Hoor-Khuit, and dominion is established in the Star of the 
     Flame. 
   </li><li> Also is the Star of the Flame exalted, bringing benediction to the universe. 
   </li><li> Here then beneath the winged Eros is youth, delighting in the one and the 
     other. He is Asar between Asi and Nepthi; he cometh forth from the veil. 
   </li><li> He rideth upon the chariot of eternity; the white and the black are harnessed 
     to his car. Therefore he reflecteth the Fool, and the sevenfold veil is reveiled. 
     {71} 
   </li><li> Also came forth mother Earth with her lion, even Sekhet, the lady of Asi. 
   </li><li> Also the Priest veiled himself, lest his glory be profaned, lest his word 
     be lost in the multitude. 
   </li><li> Now then the Father of all issued as a mighty wheel; the Sphinx, and the 
     dog-headed god, and Typhon, were bound on his circumference. 
   </li><li> Also the lady Maat with her feather and her sword abode to judge the righteous. 
     For Fate was already established. 
   </li><li> Then the holy one appeared in the great water of the North; as a golden 
     dawn did he appear, bringing benediction to the fallen universe. 
   </li><li> Also Asar was hidden in Amennti; and the Lords of Time swept over him with 
     the sickle of death. 
   </li><li> And a mighty angel appeared as a woman, pouring vials of woe upon the flames, 
     lighting the pure stream with her brand of cursing. And the iniquity was very 
     great. 
   </li><li> Then the Lord Khem arose, He who is holy among the highest, and set up 
     his crowned staff for to redeem the universe. 
   </li><li> He smote the towers of wailing; he brake them in pieces in the fire of 
     his anger, so that he alone did escape from the ruin thereof. 
   </li><li> Transformed, the holy virgin appeared as a fluidic fire, making her beauty 
     into a thunderbolt. 
   </li><li> By her spells she invoked the Scarab, the Lord Kheph-Ra, so that the waters 
     were cloven and the illusion of the towers was destroyed. {72} 
   </li><li> Then the sun did appear unclouded, and the mouth of Asi was on the mouth 
     of Asar. 
   </li><li> Then also the Pyramid was builded so that the Initiation might be complete. 
   </li><li> And in the heart of the Sphinx danced the Lord Adonai, in His garlands 
     of roses and pearls making glad the concourse of things; yea, making glad 
     the concourse of things.
