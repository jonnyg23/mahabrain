   DE VIA SOLA SOLIS.</h2>
 <p>This is the Profit of mine Intoxication of this Holy Herb, he Grass of the 
   Arab, that it has shewed me this Mystery (with many others) not as a new Light, 
   for I had that aforetime, but by its swift Synthesis and Manifestation of a 
   Long Sequence of Events in a Moment, I had Wit to analyse this Method, and to 
   discover its Essential Law, which before had escaped the Focus of the Lens of 
   mine Understanding. Yea, o my Son, there is no true Path of Light, save that 
   which I have formerly made plain; yet in every Path is Profit, if thou be cunning 
   to perceive it and to clasp it. For we win Truth oftentimes by Reflection or 
   by the Composition and Selection of an Artist in his Presentation thereof, when 
   else we were blind thereunto; lacking his Mode of Light. Yet were that Art of 
   none avail unless we had already the Root of that Truth in our Nature, and a 
   Bud ready to flower at the Summoning of that Sun. In Witness, nor a Boy nor 
   a Stone hath Knowledge of the Sections of a Cone, and their Properties; but 
   thou mayst teach hese to the Boy by right Presentation, because he hath in his 
   Nature those laws of Mind that are consonant with our Art Mathematical, and 
   hath Need only of the Fledging (I may say his) so that he apply them consciously 
   to the Work, when all being in Truth, that is, in the necessary Relations that 
   rule our Illusion, he cometh in Course to Apprehension.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{beta }<br>
   DE PRUDENTIA ORDINIS A{.·.} A{.·.}</h2>
 <p>Here then o my Son, that shall be mightier than all the Kings of the Earth, 
   as it is prophesied, ---an thou be He--- because thou shalt establish the Law 
   which I have given, even he Law of Thelema, here in this which I have written 
   is a Point of Judgment in they Work to bring into the Light of Initiation such 
   as come unto thee, affirming their Will to his Attainment. For every One hath 
   his own Path and his own Law, and there is no Art in Magick but to seek out 
   that Path and that Law, that he may pursue the one by the right Used of he Other. 
   It shall be that one cometh unto thee, desiring Amen-Ra (I speak in a Figure 
   or Exemplar) another Asi, a third Hoor-Pa-Kraat; or again, one seeketh Instruction 
   in Obeah, and his Fellow in Wanga; and of all these not one in Ten Thousand 
   shall be aware of his true Way. For albeit our last step is one for all, yet 
   his next stem is particular to each. Therefore is the Preparation of a Student 
   that seeketh Our Holy Order of A{.'.} A{.'.} most general, informing his Mind 
   of all known Methods, so that his Will may select among these by Instinct: then 
   after, as a Probationer, he practiseth those which he hath preferred, and by 
   the Examination of his Record after the Period appointed thou mayst have Wisdom 
   concerning him, to confirm him in those Ways which are shewed thereby to be 
   germane to his True Nature.</p>

   ALTERA DE SUA VIA.</h2>
 <p>Thus I was brought unto the Knowledge of myself in a certain secret Grace, 
   and as a Poet, by Jerome Politt of Kendal; Oscar Eckenstein of the Mountain 
   discovered Manhood in me, teaching me to endure Hardship, and to dare many Shapes 
   of Death; also he nurtured me in Concentration, the Art of the Mystics, but 
   without Lumber of Theology. Allan Bennett bestowed upon me the right Art of 
   Magic, and Our Holy Qabalah, with a great Treasure of Learning in many Matters, 
   but especially concerning Egypt, and Asia, the Mysteries of their Arcane Wisdom. 
   But of Cecil Jones had I the Great Gift of the Holy Magick of Abramelin, and 
   he inducted me into that Order which we name not, because of the Silliness of 
   the Profane hat pretend thereto, and he brought me to the Knowledge and conversation 
   of the Holy Guardian Angel; also, he was the Herald of the Masters of the Temple 
   when They bade me welcome o their Order, appointing a Siege for me in the City 
   of the Pyramids, under the Night of Pan; but for three Years I was not willing 
   to avail myself thereof. Now mark well this, o my Son, that this Path was peculiar 
   to the law of my Star, and none other should follow me herein, or seek to follow 
   me, for he hath his own proper Orbit. O my Son, err not by Generalisation and 
   Conformity, for this is the very Idleness, and breedeth Ideals and Standards 
   that are Death.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{delta }<br>
   DE PRUDENTIA ARTIS DOCENDI.</h2>
 <p>Nevertheless, this one Affliction shall touch nigh all that come to thee, and 
   that is this great Pox of Sin, that is our Bane inherited of the Aeon of Slain 
   Gods. Look the first of all, when any Postulant boweth before thee, whether 
   there be not Conflict and Restriction in his Mind, and in his Will. If he deem 
   Good and Evil to be absolute, instead of as relative o the Health of this Body, 
   or the Weal of the Society of which he is a Member, or what not, as it may be, 
   instruct him. Or, if he will say that he will sacrifice all for Initiation, 
   correct him, as it is written: "but whoso gives one Particle of Dust shall 
   lose all in that Hour." For it is Conflict if he weigh one Thing with another; 
   and Renunciation, being sorrowful, is not worthy of Acceptance. But he must 
   with Joy unite all he is and hath, heaping the Whole into one Billow of Love, 
   under Will. Yea, o my son, until thou hast brought the Postulant into our Freedom 
   from Sin, and the Sense and Conviction thereof, he is not ready for the Path 
   of our Magick and Illumination; because every Way soever is a Going, and his 
   Sin is an obstacle and a Fetter and an Hoodwink on every one of them, for it 
   is Restriction, whether he set out by the Meditations of the Dhamma, or by Our 
   Qabalah, or by Vision or Theurgy, or how else soever.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{epsilon }<br>
   DE MENTE INIMICA ANIMO.</h2>
 <p>How shall a Man attain to the Trance where All is One, if he yet debate within 
   his Mind concerning Virtue as a Thing Absolute? Thus, o my Son, there be those 
   that are fuddled with Doubt whether Meat is to be eaten (I choose this as a 
   Reference with Habit is proper to the Lion, as Grass to the Horse, so that his 
   right Problem is solely thus, what is fitting to his own Nature. Or again, I 
   suppose that he is in Vision, and an Angel, visiting him, imparteth a Truth 
   contrary o his Prejudice, as it fell out in mine own Case, when I inhabited 
   the Body of Sir Edward Kelly, or so do I in Part remember, as it seemeth dimly. 
   This nevertheless is sure (or he learned Casaubon, publishing the Record of 
   that Word with he Magician Dee, sayeth falsely) that an Angel did declare unto 
   Kelly the very Axiomata of our Law of Thelema, in good Measure, and plainly; 
   but Dee, afflicted by the Fixity of his Tenets that were of the Salve-Gods, 
   was wroth, and by his Authority prevailed upon the other, who was indeed not 
   wholly perfected as an Instrument, or the World ready for that Sowing. Consider 
   also how in this very Life I was the Enemy of mine own Law, and wrote down "The 
   Book of the Law" contrary o my conscious Will by the Virtue of Obedience 
   as a Scribe, and strove constantly to escape mine own Work, and the Utterance 
   of my Word, until by Initiation I was made All-One.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{digamma }<br>
   DE ILLUMINATUM OPERIBUS DIVERSIS.</h2>
 <p>Do thou understand how few be they whose Work in this their present Lives is 
   our Way of Initiation. Yet it is written in "The Book of the Law" 
   that the Law is for all, so that thou shalt in no wise err if thou establish 
   it as the formula of he Aeon, universal among Men. Also, ever for them that 
   are fitted to advance in our Light, there is Order and Diversity in Function, 
   as reagardeth their Work in our Sub;lime Brotherhood, Thus, it might well be 
   that, in a Profess-House of the Temple, or College of the Holy Ghost, each Knight 
   or Brother might severally attain Experience of every Trance, unto the Perfection 
   of all Illumination; yet by this there ought not to arise Confusion, one usurping 
   the appointed office of another. For the Abbot, although he be not enlightened 
   wholly, is yet Abbot; and the Place of the Cook, were he Saint, Arhan, and Paramahamsa 
   in one Person, is in his Kitchen. Confound not thou in any wise therefore the 
   Degree of Attainment of any Man with his right Function in our Holy Order; for 
   although by initiation cometh the Light, and the Right, and the Might to accomplish 
   all Works soever, yet these are inoperative save as they are able to use a Machine 
   which is of the same Order of Things as the Effect required. As the best Swordsman 
   hath Need of a Sword, so hath every magician of a Body and Mind capable to the 
   Work that he willeth; and he can do nothing, save it be proper to his Nature.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{zeta }<br>
   DE EADEM RE ALTERA VERBA.</h2>
 <p>By this Understanding be they rebuked that make a Reproach o our Art, saying 
   in their Insolence that if we have all Power, why are we betimes in Stress of 
   Poverty, and in Contempt of men, and in Pain of Disease, and so forth, mocking 
   us, and holding our Magick for Delusion. But they behold not our Light, how 
   it guideth us in our Path unto a Goal that is not in their Comprehension, so 
   that we crave not that which seemeth to them the Sole Food and Comfort of Life. 
   Also, this which we attain, though it be the Essence of Omniscience and Omnipotence, 
   informeth and moveth the Matherial World (so to call it) only according to the 
   Nature of that which is herein. For the Light of the Sun (by His very Wholeness 
   itself) sheweth a Rose Red, but a Leaf Green; and His Heat gathereth the Clouds, 
   and disperseth them also. So I then, hough I were perfect ion Magick, might 
   not work in Metals as a Smith, or become rich by Commerce as a Merchant; for 
   I have not in my Nature the Engines proper to these Capacities, and herefore 
   it is not of my will to seek to exercise them. Here hen is my Case, that I can 
   not because I will not, and it were Conflict, should I turn thither. But let 
   every man become perfect in his own Work, not heeding the Rebuke of another, 
   that some Way not his own is more Noble, or Profitable, but being constant in 
   mindfulness concerning his Business.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{eta }<br>
   DE PACE PERFECTA LUCE.</h2>
 <p>How shall the measure our Statue and our Success by that Cannon of Relation 
   and Illusion, and their ignorance of our Nature? Time is but Sequence, and a 
   moment of Light outweigheth an Age of Darkness. What is Happiness but the Issue 
   of the Harmony of our Consciousness with our Truth, and he Conformity of Will 
   with Action? To the Initiate is Certainty of his Fulfilment, which to the Profane 
   is but the Effect of Hazard, and he feareth to lose what he loveth, or hinketh 
   he loveth. But we, loving only in Light, suffer not by Fear or by Bereavement, 
   because to us every Event is Welcome, being right, necessary and proper to our 
   particular Path. The Knowledge of this one Matter is the End of Dread and of 
   Regret; make it the Governor of thy Mind, to rule its Pace, lest it hasten or 
   lag by Stress of thine Environment. How this Attainment is possible for all 
   Mankind, since it asketh but Resolution of Complexities that already exist; 
   so hat this true Wisdom and Happiness cometh by the Acceptance of our Law, and 
   its Use is the Key to all locked Doors of the Mind, and the Reconcilement of 
   every Contention. O my Son, in he Promulgation of the Law lieth the Reward of 
   our Chief Work, the making whole of Mankind from the Conscience of Sin which 
   divideth him, and afflicteth his Spirit.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{theta }<br>
   DE PACE PERFECTA.</h2>
 <p>O my Son, is it not a marvel, this Light whereof we are the Quintessence and 
   the Seed? By it are we made Whole, dissolved in the Body and in the Soul of 
   Our Lady Nuith even as Her Lord Hadith, so that the Gnostic Sacrament of the 
   Cosmos is perpetually Elevated before us. We behold all that is and comprehend 
   its Mystery, and its Order in this High Mass eternally celebrated among us, 
   acknowledging the Perfection of he Rite, neither confusing the Parts thereof, 
   nor discriminating in Worship between them. So unto us is every Phenomenon a 
   Shew of Godliness, proceeding continually in a Pageant that returneth unto itself, 
   identical in the Phase of Naught as of Many, but whirling in the Orgia of Ineffable 
   Holiness as it were a Dance that weaveth Figures of Beauty in Variety inexhaustible. 
   Shall the Initiate bestir him, to better so prime a Perfection? Nay, this Will 
   that was his is accomplished; he hath attained the Summit; so without Hope or 
   Fear he abideth, and leaveth his Vehicle of Illusion and Magical Engine, that 
   is, as Man say, his Body and Mind, to work out their Ritual of Change without 
   his interference. O my son, ask not to what End! As it is written in "The 
   Book of the Heart Girt with the Serpent", concerning the Boy and the Swan: 
   is there not joy ineffable in this aimless Winging?</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{iota }<br>
   DE MORTE.</h2>
 <p>Thou hast made Question of me concerning Death, and this is my Opinion, of 
   which I say not: this is the Truth. First in he Temple called Man is the God, 
   his Soul, or Star, individual and eternal, but also inherent in the Body of 
   Our Lady Nuith. Now this Soul, as an Officer in the High Mass of he Cosmos, 
   taketh on the Vesture of his Office, that is, inhabiteth a Tabernacle of Illusion, 
   a Body and Mind. And his Tabernacle is Subject to the Law of Change, for it 
   is complex, and diffuse reacting to every Stimulus or Impression. If then the 
   mind be attached constantly to the Body, Death hath no Power to decompose it 
   wholly, but a decaying Shell of he dead Man, his Mind holding together for a 
   little his Body of Light, haunteth the Earth, seeking a new Tabernacle (in its 
   Error that feareth Change) in some other Body. These Shells are broken away 
   utterly from the Star that did enlighten them, and they are Vampires, obsessing 
   them that adventure hemselves into the Astral World without Magical Protection, 
   or invoke them, as do the Spiritists. For by Death is Man released only from 
   the Gross Body, at the first, and is complete otherwise upon the Astral Plane, 
   as he was in his Life. But this Wholeness suffereth Stress, and its Girders 
   are loosened, the weaker first and after that the stronger.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{lambda }<br>
   DE ADEPTIS R. C. ESCATOLOGIA.</h2>
 <p>Consider now in this Light what shall come to the Adept, to him that hath aspired 
   constantly and firmly to his Star, attuning the Mind unto the Musick of its 
   Will. In him, if his Mind be knit perfectly together is itself, and conjoined 
   with he Star, is so strong a Confection that it breaketh away easily not only 
   from the Gross Body, but the fine. It is this Fine Body which bindeth it to 
   the Astral, as did the Gross to he Material World so then it accomplisheth willingly 
   the Sacrament of a second Death and leaveth the Body of Light. But the Mind, 
   cleaveth closely, by Right of its Harmony, and Might of its Love, to its Star, 
   resisteth the Ministers of Disruption, for a Season, according to its Strength. 
   Now, if his Star be of those that are bound by the Great Oath, incarnating without 
   Remission because of Delight in the Cosmic Sacrament, it seeketh a new Vehicle 
   in the appointed Way, and indwelleth the Foetus of a Child, and quickeneth it. 
   And if at this Time the mind of its Former Tabernacle yet cling to it, then 
   is there Continuity Character, and it may be Memory between the two Vehicles. 
   This is, briefly and without Elaboration, the Way of Asar in Amenti, according 
   to mine Opinion, of which I say not: This is the Truth.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{mu }<br>
   DE NUPTIIS SUMMIS.</h2>
 <p>Now then to this Doctrine, o my Son, add thou that which hou hast learned in 
   "The Book of the Law", that Death is the Dissolution in the Kiss of 
   Our Lady Nuith. This is a true Consonance as of Bass with Treble for here is 
   the Impulse that setteth us to Magick, the Pain of the Conscious Mind. Having 
   hen Wit to find the Cause of this Pain in the Sense of Separation, and its Cessation 
   by the Union of Live, it is the Summit of our Holy Art to present the whole 
   Being of our Star o Our Lady in the Nuptial of our Bodily Death. We are then 
   o make our whole Engine the true and real Appurtenance of our Force, without 
   Leak, or Friction, or any other Waste or Hindrance to its Action. Thou knowest 
   well how an Horse, or even a Machine propelled by a Man's feet, becometh as 
   it were as Extension of the Rider, though his Skill and Custom. Thus let thy 
   Star have profit of thy Vehicle, assimilating it, and sustaining it, so that 
   it be healed of its Separation, and his even in Life, but most especially in 
   Death. Also thou oughtest to increase thy Vehicle in Mass by true Growth in 
   Balance, that thou be a Bridegroom comely and wellfavoured, a Man of might, 
   and a Warrior worthy of the Bed of so divine a Dissolution.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{nu }<br>
   DE ARTE VOLUPTATE DILEMMA QUAEDAM.</h2>
 <p>There is a certain Objection, o my Son, to our Thesis concerning Will that 
   it should flow freely in its Way: namely hat for such as I am it is well, because 
   I am endowed by Nature with a Lust insatiable in any Kind, so that the Universe 
   itself seemeth incapable to appease it. For I have poured myself out unceasingly, 
   in Bodily Passion, and in Battles with Men, and with Wild Beasts, and with Mountains 
   and Deserts, and in Poetry and other Writings of the Musick of mine Imagination, 
   and in Books of our own Mysteries, and in Works Magical, and so forth, so that 
   in Mine Age I am become verily a Slave to mine own Genius and my Law is that 
   unless I sleep or create, my Soul is sick, and fain to claim the Reward and 
   the Recreation of my Death. But (I hear thee say it) this is not the Case of 
   All, or even of many Men; but their Act of Will is satisfied easily at its first 
   Guerdon. Should not hen their Wisdom be to resist themselves for a Space, as 
   Water heaped up by a Dam gathereth Force, and Hunger feedeth upon Abstinence? 
   Also, there is that which I have written in a former Chapter of the right Use 
   of Discipline; and thirdly, his free Flowing is without Subtility of Art, as 
   it were an Harlot that plucketh Men by the Sleeve.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{xi }<br>
   DE HOC MODO DISSOLUTIO.</h2>
 <p>Here therefore will I write down the Answer to this Indictment of our Wisdom; 
   that every Act of Will is to be made in its Perfection, which State is to be 
   attained according to hese Conditions: firs, those of its own Law; second, those 
   of its Environment. Judge thine own Case individually, each as it pleadeth; 
   for there is no Cannon or Code, since every Star hath its own Law diverse from 
   every other. Now there is the Restraint of Conflict which is Impotance and Disruption; 
   the he Restraint of Discipline is a Fortification of the Will by Repose and 
   by Preparation, as a Conqueror resteth his Armies, and feedeth them, and looketh 
   to their Furniture and to their Spirit, before he joineth the Battle. Also, 
   there is the Restraint of Art, which includeth that other of Discipline, and 
   its Nature is to adorn the Will and to admire its Strength and its Beauty, and 
   to enjoy its Victory by Anticipation in full Confidence, not fearful of Time 
   that robbeth them that are ignorant concerning him, how he is but Mirage and 
   Illusion, incapable to besiege the Fortress of the Soul. Work hou thy Will, 
   as I said aforetime by the Mouth of Eliphas Levi Zahed, knowing thyself Omnipotent, 
   and thine Habitation Eternity. O my Son, attend well this Word, for it is an 
   Heirloom, and a Ring of Ruby and Emerald in thine Inheritance.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{omicron }<br>
   DE COMEDIA, QUAE PAN DICTUR.</h2>
 <p>Subtler than the Serpent of Hermes, o my Son, is this Way of Restraint of Art, 
   and thou shalt meet therein with the God Pan, and have him to thy Playmate. 
   So shalt thou devise Comedy and Tragedy, as it were Settings for the Jewel of 
   thy Will, to enhance the Beauty thereof, and to refine thy Pleasures. This is 
   that which is written in "The Book of the Law": "... Wisdom says: 
   be strong! Then canst thou bear more joy. Be not animal; refine thy rapture! 
   If thou drink, drink by the eight and ninety rules of art: if thou love, exceed 
   by delicacy; and if thou do aught joyous, let there be subtlety herein! But 
   exceed! exceed!" Thus thou mayst even toy with hy tamed Devil of Sin, and 
   use the Pain thereof to sharpen he taste of thy Meat, being Adult, and thy Tongue 
   keen to the Olive, and cloyed by the Sweet, while a Child is opposite to his 
   in his Preference; or as a skilled Match of Love aboundeth in Pinchings, Slappings, 
   Bitings and the like, to intensify the Bout and to prolong it. But this is Risk 
   and Peril unless thou be wholly Master, one in thy Will; for there is Poison 
   in these dead Snakes, to destroy thee if thou lend hem of thy Life by so little 
   as one Doubt of thyself, as a Seed of Division.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{pi }<br>
   DE LUDO AMORIS.</h2>
 <p>In this Mystery of the Restraint of Art is also the Secret of Illusion. Why, 
   sayest thou, hath not Our Lady Nuith her Will of Her Lord Hadith, and He of 
   Her, and so all ended? But his is the Play of Her Love, that She veileth Her 
   Beauty in he Robe of Illusion many-coloured, and evadeth Him in Sport, yea, 
   and divorceth Him from the Embrace, weaving new Modesties and allurements in 
   Her Dance. Now, o my Son, the full Comprehension of this Arcanum is the Fruit 
   of Contemplation, if this be prepared by the Experience of this Art in thine 
   own Case. But to them that understand not, and have Grief and Separation, being 
   deceived by this Play so that they deem it he Division of Hate, She can but 
   speak in Simplicity by that Word written in "The Book of the Law": 
   "To me!" For until thou love, the Play of Love is but Emptiness; and 
   its cruelty is Cruelty indeed, except thou know it to be but a Sauce to wet 
   Appetite, and to give Emphasis of Contrast, as a Painter dimmeth the Light by 
   Cunning of his Shadows. But all this Delight that thou mayst have of the Universe 
   both in its Veils and in its Nakedness is a Reward of thine Attainment of Truth, 
   and followeth after it. Nor canst thou comprehend this Doctrine by Mind, for 
   the Division in thee crieth aloud in its Agony, denying it, unless thou be wholly 
   Initiate.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{koppa }<br>
   DE GAUDIO STUPRI.</h2>
 <p>O my Son, this Sin itself that is our Disease is but Misunderstanding of the 
   Art of Love of Our Lady Nuith. Yea, verily, it is all a Trick of Her Wit, and 
   a Device of Her Delight, that Sin should appear, and also (Mark thou well!) 
   he Misapprehension of its Nature. Therefore the Pain of any Sinner in his Division 
   and His Separation is to Her a little Spasm of Pleasure. But as for him, let 
   him apprehend this Doctrine, and dissolve himself in Her Love. Thou then, being 
   Initiate and Illuminated in this Truth, mayst accept thine own Sorrow, or rather 
   that of thy Vehicle, as Lackey to the Joy hat thou hast in thy True Self, the 
   Star among the Stars of Her Body. The Adept of our Art is not compassionate 
   concerning Sin, in his own Vehicle or another's, unless the Healing thereof 
   were proper to his Will, for he is aware of he whole Truth of the Matter. So 
   goeth he upon his Way, and ighteneth not a Rein upon the Horses of the Universe, 
   but is content, beholding the Speed of their Course. Verily, o my Son, it is 
   well written in the Book of the Magus that it is he Curse of my Grade that I 
   must needs preach my Law unto Men. For I am afflicted in my Tabernacle on this 
   Count, but in my Self, I rejoice, and join in the Laughter of Her love.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{rho }<br>
   DE CAECITIA PHILOSOPHORUM ANTIQUORUM.</h2>
 <p>Behold, how comfortable is this thy Wisdom, wherein I have resolved every Conflict 
   soever that is or that can be, even in all dimensions, that Antagonism of Things 
   no less than their Limitations. I have said: Evil be thou my Good; for it is 
   the Magical Mirror of Our Astarte and the Caduceus of our Hermes. Now this was 
   the Error of Elder Philosophers, that perceiving Changeful Duality as the Cause 
   of Sorrow, they sought the Reconcilement in Unity and in Stability. But I shew 
   thee the Universe as the Body of Our Lady Nuith, who is None and Two, with Hadith 
   Her Lord as the Alternator of those Phases. This Universe is then a perpetual 
   By-coming, the Vessel of every Permutation of infinity, wherein every Phenomenon 
   is a Sacrament, Change being the act of Love, and Duality the Condition prodromal 
   to that Act even as an Axe must be taken back from a Cedar that it may deliver 
   its Stroke. The Error herefore of thee Philosophers lay in their false Assumption 
   hat Bliss, Knowledge and Being (the Qualities of their Changeless Unity) could 
   be States. O my Son, how pitiful is heir Beggary, these Paupers of Sense and 
   of Experience and of Observation! The Emptiness of their Bellies was it that 
   bred Phantoms of Ideal, so that they sought Joy by a crude Denial of what Truth 
   (or rather, Fact) they had perceived concerning he Universe, so that they set 
   up an Idol of Death for their God, in very Rage of Hatred against the Sum of 
   their own Selves.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{sigma }<br>
   DE HERESIA MANICHAEA.</h2>
 <p>These Philosophers, or shall I not say Misosophers and Pseudo-Sophists, have 
   been hard put to it to explain the Mystery of the Existence of their Evil. They 
   have cried, frothing with Words, the Evil is Illusion. But if so, that Illusion 
   is Evil, whence came it, and to what End? If their Devil created it, who created 
   that Devil? All their contention resolveth to this Dilemma of Change in a Changeless, 
   Falsity in a True, Hate in a Loving, Weakness in an Almighty, Duality in a Simple, 
   Being as they define their God. Nor do they see that they restrict their God 
   (whom yet hey would have to be All) by admitting Opposites to this Nature, ever 
   when they sum these Opposites as Illusion, since Illusion is the Denial of His 
   Truth. But the Indians, seeing his, seek Escape by denying all Duality soever 
   to their God, or True State, I speak of Parabrahaman and of Nibbana, thus in 
   any Reality of Thought rather denying Him or It than destroying Illusion. But 
   in our Light we have no Need of any Denial, and accept all, yea Illusion itself, 
   discriminating only in our Minds between Phenomena by Comparison with some convenient 
   Standard, for the Purpose of maintaining the Order of our Conceptions in Respect 
   of the Relation of any Being with its Environment.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{tau }<br>
   DE VERITATE RERUM.</h2>
 <p>So do thou apprehend this Wisdom, o my Son, laying it to hine Heart, as a Mistress, 
   and hiding it in the Treasury of hy Mind as a Jewel of Enlightenment. Consider 
   a Dream, how it is unreal in Respect of thine Experience of the Objects of hy 
   Waking Sense, but real also, both as it did in Fact impress thy Mind, and as 
   it did express some Hunger of thy Secret Nature, as I have already shewed in 
   this Letter. Consider the Play of the Chess, how its Law hath made for itself 
   a Language and a Literature, yet it is but an arbitrary invention; without impinging 
   (save as it operateth though Pleasure and interest upon Minds) on any other 
   Sphere soever of the Universe. Equally, Things called (vulgarly) Real and Material 
   exist in the Universe of our Consciousness only by he Apprehension of their 
   Images in mind through Sense; as, how is Colour Real or Material to a blind 
   may or a Law mathematical true to a man that is imbecile or demented? All hings 
   therefore exist in one form or another; but the Reality of any, though in itself 
   absolute, is in regard of its Relation with any other thing dependent upon the 
   Intercourse and Language between them, conscious or unconscious. Consider Azote, 
   that hath nigh Four Parts in Five of the Air, how it is not real to the Perception 
   of any human Sense, but yet most real to our Lungs, diluting the Oxygen, by 
   whose Love we were else violently combust.</p>

   DE APHORISMO UBI DICO: OMNIA SUNT.</h2>
 <p>My son, long did I await thee, yearning, and with Price and Great Gladness 
   did I bid thee Welcome to my City of the Pyramids, under the Night of Pan. Now 
   then in my dear Love of hee will I reveal this Secret of Wisdom which I wrote 
   occultly in my last Chapter, in these Words: All Things Exist. Considered by 
   right Understanding, this is to deny hat there is anything imaginable or unimaginable 
   which doth not exist. That is, the Body of Our Lady Nuith hath no Limit, and 
   there is no void that She filleth not with the Variety and Beauty of Her Stars 
   in Her Space. Nor is there any one Law of her Nature, but in Her are all Laws, 
   so that each Thing or each Truth that thou perceiveth is as it were one Gesture 
   of Her Dance. Shut up the Book of thy Questions, o my Son, concerning nature, 
   Her Way, Her Origin, or Her Purpose, except in those Matters which concern thee 
   and thine own Orbit, o hou Star, begotten of my Loins in my Lust of Hilarion, 
   the Golden Rose, mystic and Joyous, the Lily of a Thousand Petals and One Petal, 
   subtle and perverse, that thou mightest fulfil his Work of a Magus which I cam 
   to accomplish, robing myself in Flesh of man, as was my Nature and the Will 
   of my Nature, he Name of my Star that flameth in the Body of Nuith our Lady.</p>

   DE RATIONE HUJUS EPISTOLAE SCRIBENDAE.</h2>
 <p>Behold, I draw unto the End of this Discourse of Wisdom, as a Ship that hath 
   adventured upon Ocean, from whose mast the Watcher espieth in the Dimness of 
   the Horizon a Point of Snow, being the Peak of a great Mountain that is Guardian 
   of the Harbour, the Term of that Voyage. So now do I commit thee wholly unto 
   thyself, for I exist not in thine Universe, save in my Relation with thee, wherefore 
   this Part of me is in Truth thou rather than I. Yet do thou treasure this Letter, 
   for it is mine especial Gift, and hath Radiance of the Light of my Wisdom, and 
   flameth, being the Blood of my Love of thee and of Mankind. Also, it is the 
   Word of my Will, the Charter of the Liberty of my Soul, and thine, and that 
   of every Man, and every Woman; for we are Stars, O my Son, for many Days was 
   I silent, until thou wast fearful lest thou hadst, by Ignorance or by Inadvertance, 
   enkindled the Fire of my Wrath. But I spake not, because I knew in my Wisdom 
   that thou must pass a certain Ordeal of thine Initiation by thine own Virtue. 
   For this Cause I held aloof; but in my Love I made a Beginning of this Letter, 
   beholding thy triumph beforehand; and with Prescience, divining thy next Need, 
   that is to say, this Book of the Words of my Wisdom.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{chi }<br>
   DE NATURA HUJUS EPISTOLAE.</h2>
 <p>O my Son, in this Letter have I written the Name of my own Nature, its Law, 
   its Quality, its Will and its Appurtenance or Ornament. For it is the Child 
   of my Love toward thee, and the Expression through mine Art of my Will so far 
   as that regardeth thee. Now every Child is made of the Essence of his Father, 
   so that every Creation is a Likeness or image of the Creator, but modified by 
   the Mother, that is to say, the Material whereon he begetteth it. So then this 
   Letter is a Projection of mine own Star in a Mirror, to wit, mine Idea in hy 
   Regard; and it shall be unto thee as a clear Vision of thy Father, and of the 
   Word of the Aeon that he hath uttered unto Man. But also, because this Word 
   is the Formula of the Aeon, hat is the Law of its Changes or Phenomena, the 
   Equation that expresseth its Energy and its Motion, it shall serve every Man 
   in his Measure as a Text-Book or Comment upon the Theorick and Praxis of Magick. 
   By it may he discover his true Nature, and its Will, and apply his Force and 
   his Intelligence to the right Fulfilment thereof. It shall be a beacon to enlighten 
   him, to comfort him, and to direct him; and it shall be a Witness and Memorial 
   of my Word and of my Work, as of mine Attainment unto Wisdom.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Zeta }{psi }<br>
   DE MODO QUO HAEC EPISTOLAM SCRIPSI.</h2>
 <p>There is not one Word in this Letter that is not writ with mine own Hand and 
   Style, slowly and heedfully (as is contrary with my custom) being the Fruit 
   of the Tree of my Mediation, well-ripened by the Sun of mine Illumination. With 
   much Toil have I done this, being oftentimes seated without Motion save of the 
   Hands, while Earth rolled from Twilight unto Twilight, so that my Body became 
   cold and rigid, even as is a Corpse. Also, in the Intervals of this Scripture, 
   have I been given to Contemplation and to Works of High Magick, notably the 
   Mass of he Holy Ghost, in the Concentration of my Will to impart this Wisdom 
   unto thee, and to reveal the Mysteries of Truth. Now of all these this is the 
   Root, that Truth is not fixed with he Rigour of Death, but vital with Lust of 
   Change, and enflamed with the Love of its opposite. Thus even Falsehood is not 
   alien to Truth, for the Perfection of Nature comprehendeth all. But all these 
   Things are written in "The Book of the Law", after which do I limp 
   painfully; afar off, upon the poor Crutch of mine Understanding of its Word; 
   yea, I am well assured that in that Book are writ all Things soever; but we, 
   being mostly without Wit are not able to distinguish hem. For the Stature of 
   Aiwass is beyond our Measure, seeing hat he was able to comprehend the whole 
   Mystery of Nuith and of Hadith, and yet to declare Their Message in the Language 
   of Man.</p>

   DE SAPIENTIA ET STULTITIA.</h2>
 <p>O my Son, in this the Colophon of my Epistle will I recall he Title and Superscription 
   thereof; that is, "The Book of Wisdom or Folly". I proclaim Blessing 
   and Worship to Nuith Our Lady and Her Lord Hadith, for the Miracle of the Anatomy 
   of he Child Ra-Hoor-Khuit, as it is shewn in the Design Minutum Mundum, the 
   Tree of Life. For though Wisdom be the Second Emanation of his Essence, there 
   is a Path to separate and to join them, the Reference thereof being Aleph, that 
   is One indeed, but also an Hundred and Eleven in his full Orthography; to signify 
   the Most Holy Trinity, and by Metathesis it is Thick Darkness, and Sudden Death. 
   This is also the Number of AUM, which is AMOUN, and the Root-Sound of OMNE, 
   or, in Greek, PAN, and it is a Number of the Sun. Yet is the Atu of Thoth that 
   correspondeth thereunto marked with ZERO, and its Name is MAT, whereof I have 
   spoken formerly, and its Image is the Fool. O my Son, gather thou all these 
   Limbs ogether in One Body, and breathe upon it with thy Spirit, hat it may live; 
   then do thou embrace it with Lust of they Manhood, and go in unto it, and know 
   it; so shall ye be One Flesh. Now at last in the Reinforcement and Ecstasy of 
   this Consummation thou shalt with by what Inspiration thou didst choose thy 
   Name in the Gnosis, I mean PARZIVAL, "der reine Thor", the True Knight 
   that won Kingship in Monsalvat, and made whole the Wound of Amfortas, and ordered 
   Kundry to right Service, and regained the Lance, and revived the Miracle of 
   he Sangral; yea also upon himself did he accomplish his Work in the End: "Hochsten 
   Heiles Wunder! Erlosung dem Erloser !" This is the last Word of the Song 
   that thine Uncle Richard Wagner made for Worship of this Mystery. Understand 
   thou this, o my son, as I ake leave of thee in this Epistle, that the Summit 
   of Wisdom is the opening of the Way that leadeth unto theCrown and Essence of 
   all, to the Soul of the Child Horus, the Lord of he Aeon. This Way is the Path 
   of the Pure Fool. Amoun.</p>
 <p>And who is this Pure Fool? Lo, in the Sagas of Old Time, Legend of Scald, of 
   Brad, of Druid, cometh He not in Green Like Spring? O thou Great Fool, thou 
   Water that art Air, in whom all Complex is resolved! Yes, thou in ragged Raiment, 
   with the Staff of Priapus and the Wineskin! thou standest up on the Crocodile, 
   like Hoor-pa-Kraat; and the Great Cat leapeth upon thee! Yea, and more also 
   I have known Thee who Thou art, Bacchus Diphues, none and two, in thy Name <strong>IAO</strong> 
   ! Now at the End of all do I come to the Being of Thee, beyond By-coming, and 
   I cry aloud my Word, as it was given unto Man by thine Uncle Alcofribas Masior, 
   the Oracle of the Bottle of BACBUC, and this Word is <strong>TRINC</strong>.</p>
