   The Record of the Magical Retirement of<br>

 <p><img src="images/101_s00.jpg" align="right" width="367" height="480"> <em>{Illustration: 
   BW halftone: In a black border, this is a photograph of a person, presumably 
   Crowley, in a violet (assumed from text) robe. The figure is shown in right 
   profile, inclined forward to the right about thirty degrees off the vertical. 
   The feet are bare and visible, with left foot flat and toes pointed directly 
   right, as is the orientation of the figure. The right foot is also bare, but 
   pointed at right angles to the body and directly forward, as a support at the 
   extreme left of the figure. Only the ball of the right foot meets the floor. 
   The left hand and arm are not visible. The right hand and arm to mid forearm 
   are extended directly horizontal at shoulder height and pointing forward to 
   the right. The right forefinger is extended, and a simple cylindrical stick 
   of a thickness of the finger is gripped in such fashion that one end of the 
   stick (wand) emerges directly at and beneath the extended forefinger. There 
   may be a design on the finger end of this wand, but that cannot be clearly distinguished. 
   The wand angles down slightly under the right hand and terminates about a foot 
   from its beginning in direct contact with the under-forearm. The wand is gripped 
   by all but the forefinger of the right hand. No ring is worn. The Head is completely 
   covered by a crumpled and tailed hood, apparently of a material like silk or 
   satin. Draped over the back and about the neck of the figure is an untrimmed 
   leopard skin. The tail and limbs hang to the floor in back, and are taken about 
   the neck at top, with one bit visible behind the figure at the front at about 
   the height of the diaphragm. Although not captioned in situ, the illustration 
   is identified as "Blind Force" in the list of illustrations. Some 
   nameless wag is reported to have uttered the following characterization during 
   a lecture, when confronted by a slide of this illustration: "And this is 
   a shot of Crowley with a dead cat around his neck".}</em>

 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"> PREFACE</h3>
 NOBODY is better aware than myself that this account of my Retirement labours 
 under most serious disadvantages.
 <p> The scene should have been laid in an inaccessible lamaserai in Tibet, perched 
   on stupendous crags; and my familiarity with Central Asia would have enabled 
   me to do it quite nicely.
 </p><p> One should really have had an attendant Sylph; and one's Guru, a man of incredible 
   age and ferocity, should have frequently appeared at the dramatic moment.
 </p><p> A gigantic magician on a coal-black steed would have added to the effect: 
   strange voices, uttering formidable things, should have issued from unfathomable 
   caverns. A mountain shaped like a Svastika with a Pillar of Flame would have 
   been rather taking; herds of impossible yaks, ghost-dogs, gryphons. ...
 </p><p> But my good, friends, this is not the way things happen. Paris is as wonderful 
   as Lhassa, and there are just as many miracles in London as in Luang Prabang.
 </p><p> I did not even think it necessary to go into the Bois de Boulogne and meet 
   those Three Adepts who cause bleeding at the nose, familiar to us from the writings 
   of Macgregor Mathers. {3}
 </p><p> The Universe of Magic is in the mind of a man: the setting is but Illusion 
   even to the thinker.
 </p><p> Humanity is progressing; formerly men dwelt habitually in the exterior world; 
   nothing less than giants and Paynim and men-at-arms and distressed ladies, vampires 
   and succubi, could amuse them. Their magicians brought demons from the smoke 
   of blood, and made gold from baser metals.
 </p><p> In this they succeeded; the intelligent perceived that the gold and the lead 
   were but shadows of thought. It became probable that the elements were but isomers 
   of one element; matter was seen to be but a modification of mind, or (at least) 
   that the two things matter and mind must be joined before either could be perceived. 
   All knowledge comes through the senses, on the one hand; on the other, it is 
   only through the senses that knowledge comes.
 </p><p> We then continue our conquest of matter; and we are getting pretty expert. 
   It took much longer to perfect the telescope than the motor-car. And though, 
   of course, there are limitations, we know enough to be able to predict them.
 </p><p> We know in what progression the Power to Speed coefficient of a steamboat 
   rises --- and so on.
 </p><p> But in our conquest of Nature, which we are making principally by the use 
   of the rational intelligence of the mind, we have become aware of that world 
   itself, so much so that educated men spend nine-tenths of their waking lives 
   in that world, only descending to feed and dress and so on at the imperative 
   summons of their physical constitution.
 </p><p> Now to us who thus live the world of mind seems almost as savage and unexplored 
   as the world of Nature seemed to the Greeks. {4}
 </p><p> There are countless worlds of wonder unpath'd and uncomprehended --- and even 
   unguessed, we doubt not. 
 </p><p> Therefore we set out diligently to explore and map these 
 </p><blockquote>untrodden regions of the mind.</blockquote>
 <p> Surely our adventures may be as exciting as those of Cortes or Cook! 
 </p><p> It is for this reason that I invite with confidence the attention of humanity 
   to this record of my journey. 
 </p><p> But another set of people will find another disappointment. I am hardly an 
   heroic figure. I am not The Good Young Man That Died. I do not remain in holy 
   meditation, balanced on my left eyelash, for forty years, restoring exhausted 
   nature by a single grain of rice at intervals of several months. 
 </p><p> You will perceive in these pages a man with all his imperfections thick upon 
   him trying blindly, yet with all his force, to control the thoughts of his mind, 
   so that he shall be able to say "I will think this thought and not that 
   thought" at any moment, as easily as (having conquered Nature) we are all 
   able to say "I will drink this wine, and not that wine." 
 </p><p> For, as we have now learnt, our happiness does not at all depend upon our 
   possessions or our power. We would all rather be dead than be a millionaire 
   who lives in daily dread of murder or blackmail. 
 </p><p> Our happiness depends upon our state of mind. It is the mastery of these things 
   that the Magicians of to-day have set out to obtain for humanity; they will 
   not turn back, or turn aside. {5} 
 </p><p> It is with the object of giving the reins into the hands of others that I 
   have written this record, not without pain. 
 </p><p> Others, reading it, will see the sort of way one sets to work; they will imitate 
   and improve upon it; they will attain to the Magistry; they will prepare the 
   Red Tincture and the Elixir of Life -- for they will discover what Life means. 
 </p><p> {6} 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"> PROLOGUE</h3>
 <p> IT hath appeared unto me fitting to make a careful and even an elaborate record 
   of this Great Magical Retirement, for that in the first place I am now certain 
   of obtaining some Result therefrom, as I was never previously certain. 
 </p><p> Previous records of mine have therefore seemed vague and obscure, even unto 
   the wisest of the scribes; and I am myself afraid that even here all my skill 
   of speech and study may avail me little, so that the most important part of 
   the record will be blank. 
 </p><p> Now I cannot tell whether it is a part of my personal Kamma, or whether the 
   Influence of the Equinox of Autumn should be the exciting cause; but it has 
   usually been at this part of the year that my best Results have occurred. It 
   may be that the physical health induced by the summer in me, who dislike damp 
   and chill, may being forth as it were a flower the particular kind of Energy 
   --- Sammav yamo --- which gives alike the desire to perform more definitely 
   and exclusively the Great Work, and the capacity to achieve success. 
 </p><p> It is in any case remarkable that I was born in October (18-); suffered the 
   terrible mystic trance which turned me toward the Path in October (18-); applied 
   for admission to G.'. D.'. in October (18-); opened my temple at B---e in {7} 
   October (18-); received the mysteries of L.I.L. in October (19-); and obtained 
   the grade of 6ø = 5ø; obtained the first true mystic results in October (19-); 
   first landed in Egypt in October (19-); landed again in Egypt in October (19-); 
   first parted from ... in October (19-); wrote the B.-i-M. in October (19-), 
   and obtained the grade of 7ø = 4ø; received the great Initiation in October 
   19-; and, continuing, received ........ in October 19-. 
 </p><p> So then in the last days of September 19- do I begin to collect and direct 
   my thoughts; gently, subtly, persistently turning them one and all to the question 
   of retreat and communion with that which I have agreed to call the Holy Guardian 
   Angel, whose Knowledge and Conversation I have willed, and in greater or less 
   measure enjoyed, since Ten Years. 
 </p><p> Terrible have been the ordeals of the Path; I have lost all that I possessed, 
   and all that I love, even as at the Beginning I offered All for Nothing, unwitting 
   as I was of the meaning of those words. I have suffered many and grievous things 
   at the hands of the elements, and of the planets; hunger, thirst, fatigue, disease, 
   anxiety, bereavement, all those woes and others have laid heavy hand upon me, 
   and behold! as I look back upon these years, I declare that all hath been very 
   well. For so great is the Reward which I (unworthy) have attained that the Ordeals 
   seem but incidents hardly worthy to mention, save in so far as they are the 
   Levers by which I moved the World. Even those dreadful periods of "dryness" 
   and of despair seem but the necessary lying fallow of the Earth. All those "false 
   paths" of Magic and Meditation and of Reason were not false paths, but 
   steps upon the {8} true Path; even a a tree must shoot downwards its roots into 
   the Earth in order that it may flower, and bring forth fruit in its season. 
 </p><p> So also now I know that even in my months of absorption in worldly pleasure 
   and business, I am not really there, but stand behind, preparing the Event. 
 </p><p> Imagine me, therefore, if you will, in Paris on the last day of September. 
   How surprised was I --- though, had I thought, I should have remembered that 
   it was so --- to find all my necessary magical apparatus to my hand! Months 
   before, for quite other reasons, I had moved most of my portable property to 
   Paris; now I go to Paris, not thinking of a Retirement, for I now know enough 
   to trust my destiny to bring all things to pass without anxious forethought 
   on my part --- and suddenly, therefore, here do I find myself --- and nothing 
   is lacking. 
 </p><p> I determined therefore to begin steadily and quietly, allowing the Magical 
   Will to come slowly forth, daily stronger, in contrast to my old plan, desperation 
   kindling a store of fuel dried by long neglect, despair inflaming a mad energy 
   that would blaze with violence for a few hours and then go out --- and nothing 
   done. "Not hurling, according to the oracle, a transcendent foot towards 
   Piety." 
 </p><p> Quite slowly and simply therefore did I wash myself and robe myself as laid 
   down in the Goetia, taking the Violet Robe of an Exempt Adept (being a single 
   Garment), wearing the Ring of an Exempt Adept, and that Secret Ring which hath 
   been entrusted to my keeping by the Masters. Also I took the Almond Wand of 
   Abramelin and the Secret Tibetan Bell, made of Electrum Magicum with its striker 
   of human {9} bone. I took also the magical knife, and the holy Anointing Oil 
   of Abramelin the Mage. 
 </p><p> I began then quite casually by performing the Lesser Banishing Ritual of the 
   Pentagram, finding to my great joy and some surprise that the Pentagrams instantly 
   formulated themselves, visible to the material eye as it were bars of shining 
   blackness deeper than the night. 
 </p><p> I then consecrated myself to the Operation; cutting the Tonsure upon my head, 
   a circle, as it were to admit the light of infinity: and cutting the cross of 
   blood upon my breast, thus symbolising the equilibration of and the slaying 
   of the body, while loosing the blood, the first projection in matter of the 
   universal Fluid. 
 </p><p> The whole formulating the Ankh --- the Key of Life! 
 </p><p> I gave moreover the signs of the grades from 0ø = 0ø to 7ø 4ø. 
 </p><p> Then did I take upon myself the Great Obligation as follows: 
 </p><blockquote> I. I, O.M. &amp;ampc., a member of the Body of God, hereby bind myself 
   on behalf of the whole Universe, even as we are now physically bound unto the 
   cross of suffering:<br>
   II. that I will lead a pure life, as a devoted servant of the Order:<br>
   III. that I will understand all things:<br>
   IV. that I will love all things:<br>
   V. that I will perform all things and endure all things:<br>
   VI. that I will continue in the Knowledge and Conversation of My Holy Guardian 
   Angel:<br>
   VII. that I will work without attachment: {10}<br>
   VIII. that I will work in truth:<br>
   IX. that I will rely only upon myself:<br>
   X. that I will interpret every phenomenon as a particular dealing of God with 
   my soul. 
   <p> And if I fail herein, may my pyramid be profaned, and the Eye be closed 
     upon me! 
 </p></blockquote>
 All this did I swear and seal with a stroke upon the Bell. 
 <p> Then I steadily sat down in my Asana (or sacred Posture), having my left heel 
   beneath my body pressing into the anus, my right sole closely covering the phallus, 
   the right leg vertical; my head, neck, and spine in one straight vertical line; 
   my arms stretched out resting on their respective knees; my thumbs joined each 
   to the fourth finger of the proper hand. All my muscles were tightly held; my 
   breath came steady, slow and even through both nostrils; my eyes were turned 
   back, in, up to the Third Eye; my tongue was rolled back in my mouth; and my 
   thoughts, radiating from that Third Eye, I strove to shut in unto an ever narrowing 
   sphere by concentrating my will upon the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy 
   Guardian Angel. 
 </p><p> Then I struck Twelve times upon the Bell; with the new month the Operation 
   was duly begun. 
 </p><p> Oct. I. 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"><em>The First Day</em></h3>
 <br>
 At Eight o'clock I rose from sleep and putting on my Robe, began a little to meditate. 
 For several reasons --- the journey and business of the day before, etc., etc., 
 I did not feel fresh. But forcing myself a little I rose {11} and went out to 
 the Caf du Dme where I took coffee and a biroche, after buying an 
 exercise book in which to write this record.<br>
 This was about 8.45; and now (10.10) I have written thus far. [Including the Prologue, 
 but not the Preface. --- ED.] 
 <p> 10.45. I have driven over to the Hammam through the beautiful sunshine, meditating 
   upon the discipline of the Operation.<br>
   It seems only necessary to cut off definitely dispersive things, aimless chatter 
   and such; for the Operation itself will guide one, leading to disgust for too 
   much food and so on. It there by upon my limbs any chain that requires a definite 
   effort to break it, perhaps sleep is that chain. But we shall see --- <em>solvitur 
   ambulando.</em> If any asceticism be desirable later on, true wariness will 
   soon detect any danger, and devise a means to meet it and overcome it. 
 </p><p> 12.0. Have finished bath and massage, during which I continued steadily but 
   quite gently, "not by a strain laborious and hurtful but with stability 
   void of movement," willing the Presence of Adonai. 
 </p><p> 12.5. I ordered a dozen oysters and a beefsteak, and now (12.10) find myself 
   wishing for an apple chewed and swallowed by deglutition, as the Hatha Yogis 
   do. <br>
   The distaste for food has already begun. 
 </p><p> 12.12. Impressions already <em>failing to connect.</em><br>
   I was getting into Asana and thinking "I record this fact," when I 
   saw a jockey being weighed. {12} 
 </p><p> 12.12. I thought of recording <em>my own</em> weight which I had not taken.<br>
   Good! 
 </p><p> 12.13. Pranayama [10 seconds to breath in, 20 seconds to <br>
   12.24. breathe out, 30 seconds to hold in the breath.] Fairly good; made me 
   sweat again thoroughly. Stopped not from fatigue but from lunch.<br>
   [Odd memoranda during lunch.<br>
   Insist on pupils writing down their whole day; the play as well as the work. 
   "By this means they will become ashamed, and prate no longer of 'beasts.'"]<br>
   I am now well away on the ascetic current, devising all sorts of privations 
   and thoroughly enjoying the idea. 
 </p><p> 12.55. Having finished a most enjoyable lunch, will drink coffee and smoke, 
   and try and get a little sleep. Thus to break up sleep into two shifts. 
 </p><p> 2.18. A nice sleep. Woke refreshed. 
 </p><p> 3.15. Am arrived home, having performed a little business and driven back.<br>
   Will sit down and do Asana, etc. 
 </p><p> 3.20. Have started. 
 </p><p> 3.28. 7 Pranayama cycles enough. Doubtless the big lunch is a nuisance.<br>
   I continue meditating simply. 
 </p><p> 3.36. Asana hurts badly, and I can no longer concentrate at all. Must take 
   5 minutes' rest and then persevere. {13} 
 </p><p> 3.41. Began again. I shall take "Hua allalu alazi lailaha illa hua" 
   for mantra [any sacred sentence, whose constant repetition produces many strange 
   effects upon the mind. --- ED.] if I want one, or: may Adonai reveal unto me 
   a special mantra to invoke Him! 
 </p><p> 3.51. Broke down again, mantra and all. 
 </p><p> 3.52- Went on meditating in "Hanged Man posture" [Legs <br>
   4.14. crossed, arms below head, like the figure of the Hanged Man in the Tarot 
   Cards. --- ED.] to formulate sacrifice and pain self- inflicted; for I feel 
   such a worm, able only to remain a few minutes at a time in a position long 
   since "conquered." For this reason too I cut again the Cross of Blood; 
   and now a third time will I do it. And I will take out the Magical Knife and 
   sharpen it yet more, so that this body may fear me; for that I am Horus the 
   terrible, the Avenger, the Lord of the Gate of the West. 
 </p><p> 4.15- Read Ritual DCLXXI. [The nature of this Ritual is <br>
   4.30. explained later. --- ED.] 
 </p><p> 5.10. I have returned from my shopping. Strange how solemn and dignified so 
   trivial a thing becomes, once one has begun to concentrate!<br>
   I bought two pears, half a pound of Garibaldi biscuits, and a packet of Gaufrettes. 
   I had a citron press, too, at the Dme.<br>
   At the risk of violating the precepts of Zoroaster 170 and 144 I propose to 
   do a Tarot divination for this Operation. {14} 
 </p><p> 5.10. I should explain first that I write this record for other eyes than 
   mine, since I am now sufficiently sure of myself to attain something or other; 
   but I cannot foretell exactly what form the attainment may take. Just so, if 
   one goes to call upon a friend, he may be walking or riding or sleeping.<br>
   Thus, then, is Adonai hidden from me. I know where He lives; I know I shall 
   be welcome if I call; but I do not know whether He will invite me to a banquet 
   or ask me to go out with him for a long journey.<br>
   It may be that the Rota will give me some hint.<br>
   [We have omitted the details of this divination. --- ED.]<br>
   I am never content with such divinations; trustworthy enough in material concerns, 
   in the things of the Spirit one rarely obtains good results.<br>
   The first operation was rather meaningless; but one must allow (<em>a</em>) 
   that it was a new way of dealing those cards for the opening of an operation; 
   (<em>b</em>) that I had had two false starts.<br>
   The final operation is certainly most favourable; we shall see if it comes true. 
   I can hardly believe it possible. 
 </p><p> 6.10. Will now go for a stroll, get some milk, and settle down for the evening. 
 </p><p> 10.50. I regret to have to announce that on going across to the Dme 
   with this laudable intention, Nina brought up that red-headed bundle of mischief, 
   Maryt Waska. This being in a way a "bandobast" (and so inviolable), 
   I took her to dinner, eating an omelette, and {15} some bread and Camembert, 
   and a little milk. Afterwards a cup of coffee, and then two hours of the Vajroli 
   Mudra badly performed.<br>
   All this I did with reluctance, I did with reluctance, as an act of self-denial 
   or asceticism, lest my desire to concentrate on the mystic path should run away 
   with me.<br>
   Therefore I think it may fairly be counted unto me for righteousness.<br>
   I now drink a final coffee and retire, to do I hope a more straightforward type 
   of meditation.<br>
   So mote it be.<br>
   Naked, Maryt looks like Corregio's Antiope. Her eyes are a strange grey, and 
   her hair a very wonderful reddish gold --- a colour I have never seen before 
   and cannot properly describe. She has Jewish blood in her, I fancy; this, and 
   her method of illustrating the axiom "Post coitum animal triste" made 
   me think of Baudelaire's "Une nuit que j'etais prs d'une affreuse 
   Juive": and the last line<br>
 </p><blockquote> Obscurcir la splendeur des tres froides prunelles.<br>
 </blockquote>
 and Barbey d'Aurevilly's "Rideau Cramoisi" suggested to me the following 
 poem. [We omit this poem. --- ED.] 
 <p> 11.30. Done! i' th' rough! i' th' rought! Now let me go back to my room, and 
   Work! 
 </p><p> (11.47.) Home --- undressed --- robed --- attended to toilet -- cut cross 
   of Blood once more to affirm mastery of Body --- sat down at 11.49 and ended 
   the day with 10 Pranayamas, which caused me to perspire freely, but were not 
   altogether easy or satisfactory. {16} 
 </p><h3 class="heading" align="center">The Second Day</h3>
 The Stroke of Twelve found me duly in my Asana, practising Pranayama.<br>
 Let me continue this work; for it is written that unto the persevering mortal 
 the Blessed Immortals are swift ...<br>
 What they should happen to a persevering Immortal like myself? 
 <p> 12.7. Trying meditation and mantra. 
 </p><p> 12.18. I find thoughts impossible to concentrate; and my Asana, despite various 
   cowardly attempts to "fudge" it, is frightfully painful. 
 </p><p> 12.20. In the Hanged Man posture, meditating and willing the Presence of Adonai 
   by the Ritual "Thee I invoke, the Bornless One" and mental formulae. 
 </p><p> 12.28. I'm hopelessly sleepy! Invocation as bad as bad could be --- attention 
   all over the place. Irrational hallucinations, such as a vision of either Eliphaz 
   Levi or my father (I can't swear which!) at the most solemn moment!<br>
   But the irrational character of said visions is not bad. They come from nowhere; 
   it is much worse when your own controlled brain breaks loose. 
 </p><p> 12.33. I will therefore compose myself to sleep: is it not written that He 
   giveth unto His beloved even in sleep? "Others, even in sleep, He makes 
   fruitful from His own strength." {17} 
 </p><p> 7.29. Woke and forced myself to rise. I had a number of rather pleasing dreams, 
   as I seem to remember. But their content is gone from me; and, in the absence 
   of the prophet Daniel, I shall let the matter slide. 
 </p><p> 7.44. Pranayama. 13 cycles. Very tiring; I began to sweat. A mediocre performance. 
 </p><p> 8.0- Breakfast. Hatha Yogi --- a pear and two gau-<br>
   8.20 frettes. 
 </p><p> 8.53. Have been meditating in Hanged Man position. Thought dull and wandering; 
   yet once "the conception of the Glowing Fire" seen as a planet (perhaps 
   Mars). Just enough to destroy the concentration; then it went out, dammit! 
 </p><p> 10.40. Have attended to correspondence and other business and drunk a citron 
   press.<br>
   The Voice of the Nadi began to resound. 
 </p><p> 10.50. Have done "Bornless One" in Asana. Good; yet I am filled 
   with utter despair at the hopelessness of the Task. Especially do I get the 
   Buddhist feeling, not only that Asana is intensely painful, but that all conceivable 
   positions of the body are so. 
 </p><p> 11.0. Still sitting; quite sceptical; sticking to it just because I am a man, 
   and have decided to go through with it. 
 </p><p> 11.13. Have done 10 P.Y. cycles. A bit better,and a slight hint of the Bhuchari 
   Siddhi foreshadowed. Have been saying mantra; the question arises in my mind: 
   {18} 
 </p><p> 11.13. Am I mixing my drinks unduly? I think not; if one didn't change to 
   another mystic process, one would have to read the newspaper. 
 </p><p> 11.20. This completes my half-hour of Asana. Legs very painful; yet again 
   I find myself wishing for Kandy (not sugar candy, but the place where I did 
   my first Hindu practices and got my first Results) and a life devoted entirely 
   to meditation. But not for me! I'm no Pratyeka-Buddha; a Dhamma-Buddha every 
   inch of me! [A Pratyeka-Buddha attains the Supreme Reward for himself alone; 
   a Dhamma-Buddha renounces it and returns to hell (earth) to teach others the 
   Way. --- ED.]<br>
   I now take a few minutes "off" to make "considerations."<br>
   I firmly believe that the minutest dose of the Elixir would operate as a "detonator." 
   I seem to be perfectly ready for illumination, if only because I am so perfectly 
   dark. Yet my power to create magical images is still with me. 
 </p><p> 11.40- Hanged Man posture. Will invoke Adonai once more <br>
   12.0. by pure thought. Got into a very curious state indeed; part of me being 
   quite perfectly asleep, and part quite perfectly awake. 
 </p><p> 2.10. Have slept, and that soundly, though with many dreams. Awaking with 
   the utmost horror and loathing of the Path of the Wise --- it seemed somehow 
   like a vast dragon-demon with bronze green wings iridescent that rose up startled 
   and angry. And I saw that {19}<br>
   2.10. the littlest courage is enough to rise and throw off sleep, like a small 
   soldier in complete armour of silver advancing with sword and shield --- at 
   whose sight that dragon, not daring to abide the shock, flees utterly away.<br>
   2.15. Lunch, 3 Garibaldis and 3 Gaufrettes. Wrote two letters. <br>
   2.50. Going out walk with mantra. <br>
   8.3. This walk was in a way rather a success. I got the good mantra effects, 
   <em>e.g.,</em> the brain taking it up of its own accord; also the distaste for 
   everything but Adonai became stronger and stronger.<br>
   But when I returned from a visit to B---e on an errand of comradeship --- 1 
   1/2 hours' talk to cut out of this mantra-yoga --- I found all sorts of people 
   at the Dome, where I drank a citron presse: they detained me in talk, and at 
   6.30 Maryt turned up and I had to chew a sandwich and drink coffee while she 
   dined.<br>
   I feel a little headache; it will pass.<br>
   She is up here now with me, but I shall try to meditate. Charming as she is, 
   I don't want to make love to her. 
 </p><p> 8.40. Mixed mantra and caresses rather a success. (At her request I gave M. 
   a minimum dose of X.) 
 </p><p> 9.15. Asana and Meditation with mantra since 8.40. The blackness seems breaking. 
   For a moment I got a vague glimpse of one's spine (or rather one's Sushumna) 
   as a galaxy of stars, thus suggesting the stars as the ganglia of the Universe. 
 </p><p> 9.18 To continue. 
 </p><p> 10.18. Not very satisfactory. Asana got painful; like a {20} worm I gave up, 
   and tried playing the fool; got amused by the New Monster, but did not perform 
   the "Vajroli Mudra." [For this see the Shiva Sanhita, and other of 
   the Holy Sanskrit Tantras. --- ED.]<br>
   However, having got rid of her for the moment, one may continue. 
 </p><p> 10.24- P.Y. [Prana Yama. --- ED.] 14 cycles. Some effort re-<br>
   10.39. quired; sweating appears to have stopped and Bhuchari hardly begun.<br>
   My head really aches a good deal.<br>
   I must add one or two remarks. In my walk I discovered that my mantra Hua allahu, 
   etc., really belongs to the Visuddhi Cakkram; so I allowed the thought to concentrate 
   itself there. [The Visuddhi-Cakkram: the "nerve centre," in Hindu 
   mystic physiology, opposite the larynx. --- ED.]<br>
   Also, since others are to read this, one must mention that almost from the beginning 
   of this Working of Magick Art the changed aspect of the world whose culmination 
   is the keeping of the oath "I will interpret every phenomenon as a particular 
   dealing of God with my soul" was present with me. This aspect is difficult 
   to describe; one is indifferent to everything and yet interested in it. The 
   meaning of things is lost, pending the inception of their Spiritual Meaning; 
   just as, on putting one's eye to the microscope, the drop of water on the slide 
   is gone, and a world of life discovered, though the real import of that world 
   is not apprehended, until one's knowledge becomes far greater than a single 
   glance can make it. {21} 
 </p><p> 10.55. Having written the above, I shall rest for a few moments to try and 
   get rid of my headache.<br>
   A good simile (by the way) for the Yogi is to say that he watches his thought 
   like a cat watching a mouse. The paw ready to strike the instant Mr. Mouse stir.<br>
   I have chewed a Gaufrette and drunk a little water, in case the headache is 
   from hunger. (P.S. --- It was so; the food cured it at once.) 
 </p><p> 11.2. I now lie down as Hanged Man and say mantra in Visuddhi. 
 </p><p> 11.10. I must really note the curious confusion in my mind between the Visuddhi 
   Cakkram and that part of the Boulevard Edgar Quinet which opens on to the cemetery. 
   It seems an identity.<br>
   In trying to look "at" the Cakkram, I saw that.<br>
   Query: What is the connection, which appeared absolute and essential? I had 
   been specially impressed by that gate two days ago, with its knot of mourners. 
   Could the scene have been recorded in a brain-cell adjoining that which records 
   the Visuddhi-idea? Or did I at that time unconsciously think of my throat for 
   some other reason? Bother! These things are all dog- faced demons! To work! 
 </p><p> 11.17. Work: Meditation an Mantra. 
 </p><p> 11.35. No good. Went off into a reverie about a castle and men-at-arms. This 
   had all the qualities of a true dream, yet I was not in any other sense asleep. 
   I soon will be, though. It seems foolish to persist. {22} 
 </p><p> 11.35. And indeed, though I tried to continue the mantra with its high aspiration 
   to know Adonai, I must have slept almost at once. 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"><em>The Third Day</em></h3>
 <p> 6.55. Now the day being gloriously broken, I awoke with some weariness, not 
   feeling clean and happy, not burning with love unto my Lord Adonai, though ashamed 
   indeed for that thrice of four times in the night I had been awakened by this 
   loyal body, urging me to rise and meditate --- and my weak will bade it be at 
   ease and take its rest --- oh, wretched man! slave of the hour and of the worm! 
 </p><p> 7.0- Fifteen cycles of Prana Yama put me right mentally <br>
   7.16. and physically: otherwise they had little apparent success. 
 </p><p> 7.30. Have breakfasted --- a pear and two Garibaldis. (These by the way are 
   the small size, half the big squares.) 
 </p><p> 7.50. Have smoked a pipe to show that I'm not in a hurry. 
 </p><p> 8.5. Hanged Man with mantra in Visuddhi. Thought I had been much longer. At 
   one point the Spirit began to move --- how the devil else can I express it? 
   The consciousness seemed to flow, instead of pattering. Is <em>that</em> clear?<br>
   One should here note that there may perhaps be some essential difference in 
   the operation of the Moslem and Hindu mantrams. The latter boom; the former 
   ripple. I have never tried the former at all seriously until now. {23} 
 </p><p> 8.10- <em>Meme jeu</em> --- no good at all. Think I'll get up and have <br>
   8.32. a Turker. 
 </p><p> 9.0. Am up, having read my letters. Continuing mantra all the time in a more 
   or less conscious way. 
 </p><p> 9.25. Wrote my letters and started out. 
 </p><p> 10.38. Have reached the Cafe de la Paix, walking slowly with my mantra. I 
   am beginning to forget it occasionally, mispronouncing some of the words. A 
   good sign! Now and then I tried sending it up and down my spine, with good effect. 
 </p><p> 10.40. I will drink a cup of coffee and then proceed to the Hammam. This may 
   ease my limbs, and afford an opportunity for a real go- for-the-gloves effort 
   to concentrate.<br>
   It cannot be too clearly understood that nearly all the work hitherto has been 
   preliminary; the intention is to get the Chittam (thought-stuff) flowing evenly 
   in one direction. Also one practises detaching it from the Virttis (impressions). 
   One looks at everything without seeing it.<br>
   O coffee! By the mighty Name of Power do I invoke thee, consecrating thee to 
   the Service of the Magic of Light. Let the pulsations of my heart be strong 
   and regular and slow! Let my brain be wakeful and active in its supreme task 
   of self-control! That my desired end may be effected through Thy strength, Adonai, 
   unto Whom be the Glory for ever! Amen without lie, and Amen, and Amen of Amen. 
 </p><p> 11.0. I now proceed to the Hammam. {24} 
 </p><p> 12.0. The Bath is over. I continued the mantra throughout, which much alleviated 
   the torture of massage. But I could not get steady and easy in my Asana or even 
   in the Hanged Man or Shavasana, the "corpse-position." I think the 
   heat is exciting, and makes me restless. I continue in the cooling-room lying 
   down. 
 </p><p> 12.10. I have ordered 12 oysters and coffee and bread and butter.<br>
   O oysters! be ye unto me strength that I formulate the 12 rays of the Crown 
   of HVA! I conjure ye, and very potently command.<br>
   Even by Him who ruleth Life from the Throne of Tahuti unto the Abyss of Amennti, 
   even by Ptah the swathed one, that unwrappeth the mortal from the immortal, 
   even by Amoun the giver of Life, and by Khem the mighty, whose Phallus is like 
   the Pillar in Karnak! Even by myself and my male power do I conjure ye. Amen. 
 </p><p> 12.20 I was getting sleepy when the oysters came.<br>
   I now eat them in a Yogin and ceremonial manner. 
 </p><p> 12.45. I have eaten my oysters, chewing them every one; also some bread and 
   butter in the same manner, giving praise to Priapus the Lord of the oyster, 
   to Demeter the Lady of corn, and to Isis the Queen of the Cow. Further, I pray 
   symbolically in this meal for Virtue, and Strength, and Gladness; as is appropriate 
   to these symbols. But I find it very difficult to keep the mantra going, even 
   in tune with the jaws; perhaps it is that this peculiar method of eating (25 
   minutes {25} for what could be done normally in 3) demands the whole attention. 
 </p><p> 1.30. Drifted into a nap. Well! we shall try what Brother Body really wants. 
 </p><p> 1.35. My attempt to go to sleep has made me supernaturally wakeful.<br>
   I am --- as often before --- in the state described by Paul (not my masseur; 
   the other Paul!) in his Epistle to the Romans, cap. vii. v. 19.<br>
   I shall rise and go forth. 
 </p><p> 1.55. I have a good mind to try violent excitement of the Muladhara Cakkram; 
   for the whole Sushumna seems dead. This at the risk of being labelled a Black 
   Magician --- by clergymen, Christian Scientists, and the "self-reliant" 
   classes in general. 
 </p><p> 2.15. Arrived (partly by cab) at the Place. Certain curious phenomena which 
   I have noticed at odd times --- <em>e.g.</em>, on Thursday night --- but did 
   not think proper to record must be investigated. It seems quite certain that 
   meditation-practices profoundly affect the sexual process: how and why I do 
   not yet certainly know. 
 </p><p> 2.45. Rubbish! everything perfectly normal.<br>
   Difficult, though, to keep mantram going. 
 </p><p> 3.0. Am sitting on the brink of the big fountain in the Luxembourg. This deadness 
   of the whole system continues.<br>
   To explain. Normally, if the thought be energetically directed to almost any 
   point in the body, that point is {26} felt to pulse and even to ache. Especially 
   this is the case if one vibrates a mantra or Magical name in a nerve-centre. 
   At present I cannot do this at all. The Prana seems equilibrated in the whole 
   organism: I am very peaceful --- just as a corpse is.<br>
   It is terribly annoying, in a sense, because this condition is just the opposite 
   of Dharana; yet one knows that it is a stage on the way to Samadhi.<br>
   So I rise and give confidently the Sign of Apophis and Typhon, and will then 
   regard the reflection of the sweet October Sun in the kissing waters of the 
   fountain. (P.S. --- I now remember that I forgot to rise and give the Sign.) 
 </p><p> 3.15. In vain do I regard the Sun, broken up by the lips of the water into 
   countless glittering stars --- abounding, revolving, whirling forth, crying 
   aloud --- for He whom my soul seeketh is not in these. Nor is He in the fountain, 
   eternally as it jets and falls in brilliance of dew; for I desire the Dew Supernal. 
   Nor is He in the still depths of the water; their lips do not meet His. Nor 
   --- O my soul! --- is He anywhere to be found in thy secret caverns, unluminous, 
   formless, and void, where I wander seeking Him --- or seeking rest from that 
   Search! O my soul! --- lift thyself up; play the man, be strong; harden thyself 
   against thy bitter Fate; for at the End thou shalt find Him; and ye shall enter 
   in together into the Secret Palace of the King; even unto the Garden of Lilies; 
   and ye shall be One for evermore. So mote it be! {27}<br>
   Yet now --- ah now! --- I am but a dead man. Within me and without still stirs 
   that life of sense that is not life, but is as the worms that feast upon my 
   corpse. ... Adonai! Adonai! my Lord Adonai! indeed, Thou hast forsaken me. Nay! 
   thou liest, O weak soul! Abide in the meditation; unite all thy symbols into 
   the form of a Lion, and be lord of thy jungle, travelling through the servile 
   Universe even as Mau the Lion very lordly, the Sun in His strength that travelleth 
   over the heaven of Nu in His bark in the mid-career of Day.<br>
   For all these thoughts are vain; there is but One thought, though that thought 
   be not yet born --- He only is God, and there is none other God than He! 
 </p><p> 3.30. Walking home with mantra; suddenly a spasm of weeping took me as I cried 
   through the mantra --- "My God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?" 
   --- and I have to stop and put it down!<br>
   A good thing; for it calms me. 
 </p><p> 3.45. At the Dome, master of myself. The Mantra goes just 30 times a minute, 
   1800 times an hour, 43,200 times a day. To say it a million times would take 
   longer than Mrs. Glyn's heroine did to conceive. Yet I will get the result if 
   I have to say it a hundred and eleven million times. But oh! fertilise my Akasic 
   egg today!<br>
   This remark, one should notice, is truly characteristic of the man John St. 
   John. I see how funny it is; but I'm quite serious withal. Ye dull dogs! {28}<br>
   [The "Akasic Egg" is the sphere of the personality of man. A theosophic 
   term. --- ED.] 
 </p><p> 3.55. N.B. --- Mantras might with advantage be palindromes. 
 </p><p> 3.56. I try to construct a magic square from the mantra. No good. But the 
   mantra is going much better, quite mechanically and "without attachment" 
   (<em>i.e</em>., without conscious ulterior design. "Art for Art's sake" 
   as it were). 
 </p><p> 4.10. I drink a "citron presse." 
 </p><p> 4.25. Alas! here comes Maryt (with a sad tale of X. It appears that she fainted 
   and spent some hours at the hospital. I should have insisted on her stying with 
   me; the symptoms began immediately on her drinking some coffee. I have noticed 
   with myself, that eating has started the action). 
 </p><p> 5.30. An hour of mingled nap and mantra.<br>
   I now feel alive again. It was very strange how calm and balanced I was: yet 
   now I am again energised; may it be to the point of Enthusiasm!<br>
   People will most assuredly smile at this exalted mystic; his life seems made 
   up of sleep and love-making. Indeed, to-day I have been shockingly under the 
   power of Tamas, the dark sphere. But that is clearly a fatigue-effect from having 
   worked so hard.<br>
   Oh Lord, how long? 
 </p><p> 5.50. The Mantra still ripples on. I am so far from the Path that I have a 
   real good mind to get Maryt to let me perform the Black Mass on her at midnight. 
   I would {29} just love to bring up Typhon, and curse Osiris and burn his bones 
   and his blood!<br>
   At least, I now solemnly express a pious wish that the Crocodile of the West 
   may eat up the Sun once and for all, that Set may defile the Holy Place, that 
   the supreme Blasphemy may be spoken by Python in the ears of Isis.<br>
   I want trouble. I want to say Indra's mantram till his throne gets red-hot and 
   burns his lotus-buttocks; I want to pinch little Harpocrates till he fairly 
   yells ... and I will too! Somehow! 
 </p><p> 6.15. I have now got into a sort of smug content, grinning all over like some 
   sleepy Chinese god. No reason for it, Lord knows!<br>
   I can't make up my mind whether to starve or sandwich or gorge the beast St. 
   John. He's not the least bit hungry, though he's had nothing to call a Meal 
   since Thursday lunch. The Hatha-Yoga feeding game is certainly marvellous.<br>
   I should like to work marching and breathing with this mantra as I did of old 
   with Aum Tat Sat Aum. Perhaps two steps to a mantra, and 4-8-16 steps to a breath-cycle? 
   This would mean 28 seconds for a breath-cycle; quite enough for a marching man. 
   We might try 4-8-8 to start; or even 8-8-8 (for the Chariot, wherein the Geburah 
   of me rises to Binah --- Strength winning the Wings of Understanding). [These 
   symbols, allusions, and references will all be found in 777, just published 
   by "The Equinox" --- see advt. --- ED.] {30} 
 </p><p> 6.55. I shall now ceremonially defile the Beyt Allah with Pig, to express 
   in some small measure my utter disgust and indignation with Allah for not doing 
   His job properly. I say in vain "Labbaik!" [I am here. --- ED.] He 
   answers, "But I'm <em>not</em> here, old boy --- another leg-pull!" 
   He little knows His man, though, if He thinks He can insult me with impunity. 
   Andre, un sandwich!<br>
   [Beyt Allah, the Mosque at Mecca, means "House of God" --- ED.] 
 </p><p> 7.5. I shall stop mantra while I eat, so as to concentrate (<em>a</em>) on 
   the chewing, (<em>b</em>) on defiling the House of God. Not so easy! the damned 
   thing runs on like a prairie fire. Important then to stop it absolutely at will: 
   even the Work itself may become an obsession.<br>
   11 hours with no real break --- not bad.<br>
   The bad part of to-day seems the Asana, and the deadness. Or, perhaps worse, 
   I fail to apprehend the true magical purport of my work: hence all sort of aimless 
   formulae, leading --- naturally enough --- to no result.<br>
   It just strikes me --- it may be this Isis Apophis Osiris IAO formula that I 
   have preached so often. Certainly the first two days were Isis --- natural, 
   pleasant, easy events. Most certainly too to-day has been Apophis! Think of 
   the wild cursing and black magic, etc. ... we must hope for the Osiris section 
   to-morrow or next day. Birth, death, resurrection! IAO! 
 </p><p> 7.35. The Sandwich duly chewed, and two Coffees drunk, I resume the mystic 
   Mantra. Why? Because I dam well choose to. {31} 
 </p><p> 7.50. 'Tis a rash thing to say, and I burn incense to the Infernal Gods that 
   the Omen may be averted; but I seem to have conquered the real Dweller of the 
   Threshold once and for all. For nowadays my blackest despair is tempered by 
   the certainty of coming through it sooner or later, and that with flying colours. 
 </p><p> 9.30. The last 3/4 hour I wasted talking to Dr. R---, that most interesting 
   man. I don't mean talking; I mean listening. You are a bad, idle good-for-nothing 
   fellow, O.M.! Why not stick to that mantra? 
 </p><p> 10.40. Have drunk two citrons presss and gone to my room to work a mighty 
   spell of magick Art. 
 </p><p> 11.0. Having got rid of Maryt (who, by the way, is Quite mad), and thereby 
   (one might hope) of Apophis and Typhon, I perform the Great Ritual DCLXXI with 
   good results magically; "i.e.", I formulated things very easily and 
   forcibly; even at one time I got a hint of the Glory of Adonai. But I made the 
   absurd mistake of going through the Ritual as if I was rehearsing it, instead 
   of staying at the Reception of the Candidate and insisting upon being <em>really</em> 
   received.<br>
   I will therefore now (11.50) sit down again and invoke really hard on these 
   same lines, while the Perfume and the Vision are yet formulated, though insensibly, 
   about me. And thus shall end the Third day of my retirement. 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"><em>The Fourth Day</em></h3>
 <p> 12.15. So therefore begins the fourth day of this my great magical retirement; 
   I bleed from the slashes of the {32} magick knife; I smart from the heat of 
   the Holy Oil; I am bruised by the scourge of Osiris that hath so cruelly smitten 
   me; the perfume yet fills the chamber of Art; --- and I?<br>
   Oh Adonai my Lord, surely I did invoke Thee with fervour; yet Thou camest not 
   utterly to the tryst. And yet I know that Thou wast there; and it may be that 
   the morning may being rememberance of Thee which this consciousness does not 
   now contain.<br>
   But I swear by Thine own glory that I will not be satisfied with this, that 
   I will go on even unto madness and death if it be Thy will --- but I will know 
   Thee as Thou art.<br>
   It is strange how my cries died down; how I found myself quite involuntarily 
   swinging back to the old mantra that I worked all yesterday.<br>
   However, I shall try a little longer in the Position of the Hanged Man, although 
   sleep is again attacking me. I am weary, yet content, as if some great thing 
   had indeed happened. But if I lost consciousness --- a thing no man can be positive 
   about from the nature of things --- it must have happened so quietly that I 
   never knew. Certainly I should not have thought that I had gone on for 25 minutes, 
   as I did.<br>
   But I do indeed ask for a Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel 
   which is not left so much to be inferred from the good results in my life and 
   work; I want the Perfume and the the Vision. ...<br>
   Why am I so materially wallowing in grossness? It matters little; the fact remains 
   that I do wallow. {33} I want that definite experience in the very same sense 
   as Abramelin had it; and what's more, I mean to go on till I get it. 
 </p><p> 12.34. I begin, therefore, in Hanged Man posture, to invoke the Angel, within 
   the Pyramid already duly prepared by DCLXXI. 
 </p><p> 12.57. Alas! in vain have I tried even the supreme ritual of Awaiting the 
   Beloved, although once I thought --- Ah! give unto Thy beloved in sleep!<br>
   How ashamed I should be, though! For an earthly lover one would be on tiptoe 
   of excitement, trembling at every sound, eager, afraid ...<br>
   I will, however, rise and open (as for a symbol) the door and the window. Oh 
   that the door of my heart were ever open! For He is always there, and always 
   eager to come in. 
 </p><p> 1.0. I rise and open unto my Beloved.<br>
   ... May it be granted unto me in the daylight of this day to construct from 
   DCLXXI a perfect ritual of self-initiation, so as to avoid the constant difficulty 
   of assuming various God-forms. Then let that ritual be a constant and perfect 
   link between Us ... so that at all times I may be perfect in Thy Knowledge and 
   Conversation, O mine Holy Guardian Angel! to whom I have aspired these ten years 
   past. 
 </p><p> 1.5. And though as it may seem I now compose myself to sleep, I await Thee 
   ... I await Thee! 
 </p><p> 7.35. I arise from sleep, mine eyes a little weary, my soul fresh, my heart 
   restored. {34} 
 </p><p> 8.0. Accordingly, I continue in gentle and easy meditation on my Lord Adonai, 
   without fear or violence, quite directly and naturally.<br>
   One of the matters that came up last night with Dr. R---d was that of writing 
   rubbish for magazines. He thought that one could do it in the intervals of serious 
   work; but I do not think that one should take the risk. I have spent these many 
   years training my mind to think cleanly and express beautifully. Am I to prostitute 
   myself for a handful of bread?<br>
   I swear by Thyself, O Thou who art myself, that I will not write save to glorify 
   Thee, that I will write only in beauty and melody, that I will give unto the 
   world as Thou givest unto me, whether it be a consuming fire, or a cup of the 
   wine of Iacchus, or a glittering dagger, or a disk brighter than the sun. I 
   will starve in the street before I pander to the vileness of the men among whom 
   I live --- oh my Lord Adonai, be with me, give me the purest poesy, keep me 
   to this vow! And if I turn aside, even for a moment, I pray Thee, warn me by 
   some signal chastisement, that Thou art a jealous god, and that Thou wilt keep 
   me veiled, cherished, guarded in Thine harem a pure and perfect spouse, like 
   a slender fountain playing in Thy courts of marble and of malachite, of jasper, 
   of topaz, and of lapis lazuli.<br>
   And by my magick power I summon all the inhabitants of the ten thousand worlds 
   to witness this mine oath.<br>
   8.15. I will rise, and break my fast. I think it as well to go on with the mantra, 
   as it started of its own accord. {35} 
 </p><p> 9.0. Arrived at Pantheon, to breakfast on coffee and biroche and a peach.<br>
   I shall try and describe Ritual DCLXXI; since its nature is important to this 
   great ceremony of initiation. Those who understand a little about the Path of 
   the Wise may receive some hint of the method of operation of the L.V.X.<br>
   And I think that a description will help me to collect myself for the proper 
   adaptation of this Ritual to the purpose of Self- initiation.<br>
   Oh, how soft is the air, and how serene the sky, to one who has passed through 
   the black rule of Apophis! How infinitely musical are the voices of Nature, 
   those that are heard and those that are not heard! What Understanding of the 
   Universe, what Love is the prize of him that hath performed all things and endured 
   all things!<br>
   The first operation of Ritual DCLXXI is the preparation of the Place.<br>
   There are two forces; that of Death and that of Natural Life.<br>
   Death begins the Operation by a knock, to which Life answers.<br>
   Then Death, banishing all forces external to the operation, declares the Speech 
   in the Silence.<br>
   Both officers go from their thrones and form the base of a triangle whose apex 
   is the East. They invoke the Divine Word, and then Death slays with the knife, 
   and embalms with the oil, his sister Life.<br>
   Life, thus prepared, invokes, at the summons of Death, {36} the forces necessary 
   to the Operation. The Word takes its station in the East and the officers salute 
   it both by speech and silence in their signs; and they pronounce the secret 
   Word of power that riseth from the Silence and returneth thereunto.<br>
   All this they affirm; and in affirming the triangular base of the Pyramid, find 
   that they have mysteriously affirmed the Apex thereof whose name is Ecstasy.<br>
   This also is sealed by that secret word; for that Word containeth All.<br>
   Into this prepared Pyramid of divine Light there cometh a certain darkling wight, 
   who knoweth not either his own nature, or his origin or destiny, or even the 
   name of that which he desireth. Before he can enter the Pyramid, therefore, 
   four ordeals are required of him.<br>
   So, bound and blinded, he stumbles forward, and passes through the wrath of 
   the Four Great Princes of the Evil of the World, whose Terror is about him on 
   every side. Yet since he has followed the voice of the Officer who has prepared 
   him, in this part of the Ritual no longer merely Nature, the great Mother, but 
   Neschamah (his aspiration) and the representative of Adonai, he may pass through 
   all. Yea, in spite of the menace of the Hiereus, whose function is now that 
   of his fear and of his courage, he goes on and enters the Pyramid. But there 
   he is seized and thrown down by both officers as one unworthy to enter. His 
   aspiration purifies him with steel and fire; and there as he lies shattered 
   by the force of the ritual, he hears --- even as {37} a corpse that hears the 
   voice of Israfel --- the Hegemon that chants a solemn hymn of praise to that 
   glory which is at the Apex, and who invisibly rules and governs the whole Pyramid.<br>
   Now then that darkling wight is lifted by the officers and brought to the altar 
   in the centre; and there the Hiereus accuses him of the two and twenty Basenesses, 
   while the Hegemon lifting up his chained arms cries again and again against 
   his enemy that he is under the Shadow of the Eternal Wings of the Holy One. 
   Yet at the end, at the supreme accusation, the Hiereus smites him into death. 
   The same answer avails him, and in its strength he is uplifted by his aspiration 
   --- and now he stands upright.<br>
   Now then he makes a journey in his new house, and perceives at stated times, 
   each time preceded by a new ordeal and equilibration, the forces that surround 
   him. Death he sees, and the Life of Nature whose name is Sorrow, and the Word 
   that quickeneth these, and his own self --- and when he hath recognised these 
   four in their true nature he passes to the altar once more and as the apex of 
   a descending triangle is admitted to the lordship of the Double Kingdom. Thus 
   is he a member of the visible triad that is crossed with the invisible --- behold 
   the hexagram of Solomon the King! All this the Hiereus seals with a knock and 
   at the Hegemon's new summons he --- to his surprise --- finds himself as the 
   Hanged Man of the Tarot.<br>
   Each point of the figure thus formed they crown with light, until he glitters 
   with the Flame of the Spirit. {38}<br>
   Thus and not otherwise is he made a partaker of the Mysteries, and the Lightning 
   Flash strikes him. The Lord hath descended from heaven with a shout and with 
   the Voice of the Archangel, and the trump of God.<br>
   He is installed in the Throne of the Double Kingdom, and he wields the Wand 
   of Double Power by the sings of the grade.<br>
   He is recognized an initiate, and the word of Secret Power, and the silent administration 
   of the Sacrament of Sword and Flame, acknowledge him.<br>
   Then, the words being duly spoken and the deeds duly done, all is symbolically 
   sealed by the Thirty Voices, and the Word that vibrateth from the Silence to 
   the Speech, and from the Speech again unto the Silence. Then the Pyramid is 
   sealed up, even as it was opened; yet in the sealing thereof the three men partake 
   in a certain mystical manner of the Eucharist of the Four Elements that are 
   consumed for the Perfection of the Oil.<br>
   Knox Om Pax. [With these mystic words the Mysteries Eleusinian were sealed. 
   --- ED.] 
 </p><p> 10.0. Having written out this explanation, I will read it through and meditate 
   solemnly thereupon. All this I wrote in the Might of the Secret Ring committed 
   unto me by the Masters; so that all might be absolutely correct.<br>
   One thing strikes me as worthy of mention. Last night when I went into the restaurant 
   to speak to {39}<br>
   R---d, my distaste for food was so intense that the smell of it caused real 
   nausea. To-day, I am perfectly balanced, neither hungry nor nauseated. This 
   is indeed more important than it seems; it is a sure sign when one sees a person 
   take up fads that he is under the black rule of Apophis. In the Kingdom of Osiris 
   there is freedom and light. To-day I shall eat neither with the frank gluttony 
   of Isis nor with the severe asceticism of Apophis. I shall eat as much and as 
   little as I fancy; these violent means are no longer necessary. Like Count Fosco, 
   I shall "go on my way sustained by my sublime confidence, self-balanced 
   by my impenetrable calm." 
 </p><p> 10.50. I have spent half an hour wandering in the Musee du Luxembourg.<br>
   I now sit down to meditate on this new ritual.<br>
   The following, so it appears, should be the outlines --- damn it, I've a good 
   mind to write it straight off --- no! I'll be patient and tease the Spirit a 
   little. I will be coquettish as a Spanish catamite.<br>
 </p><blockquote> 1. Death summons Life and clears away all other forces.<br>
   2. The Invocation of the Word. Death consecrates Life, who in her whirling dance 
   invokes that Word.<br>
   3. They salute the Word. The Signs and M---M1 must be a Chorus, if anything.<br>
   4. The Miraculous appearance of Iacchus, uninvoked. </blockquote>
 {40} 
 <p> 10.50 
 </p><blockquote> 1. The 3 Questions.<br>
   2. The 4 ordeals. Warning and comfort as an appeal to the Officers.<br>
   3. The Threshold.<br>

   The Chorus of Purification.<br>

 1.15. During a lunch of 12 oysters, Cepes Bordelaise, Tarte aux Cerises, Cafe 
 Noir, dispatched without Yoga or ceremonial, I wrote the Ritual in verse, in the 
 Egyptian Language. I don't think very well. Time must show: also experience. I'd 
 recite Tennyson if I thought it would give Samadhi!<br>
 Now more mantra, though by the Lord I'm getting sick of it. 
 <p> 1.40. It occurs to me, now that I am seeing my way in the Operation a little 
   more clearly, that one might consider the First Day as Osiris Slain +, the Second 
   as that of the Mourning of Isis _, the third as that of the Triumph of Apophis 
   V, and to-day that of Osiris Risen X; these four days being perfect in themselves 
   as a 5ø = 6ø operation (or possibly with one or two more {41} to recapitulate 
   L.V.X. Lux, the Light of the Cross). Thence one might proceed to some symbolic 
   passage through the 6ø = 5ø grade --- though of course that grade is really 
   symbolic of this soul-journey, not "vice versa" --- and through 7ø 
   = 4ø; so perhaps --- if one could only dare to hope it! --- to the 8ø = 3ø attainment. 
   Certainly what little I have done so far pertains no higher than Minor adeptship 
   though I have used higher formulae in the course of my working. 
 </p><p> 1.55. My Prana is acting in a feverish manner; a mixture of fatigue and energy. 
   This is not good: it probably comes from bolting that big lunch, and may mean 
   that I must sleep to recover equilibrium. I will, however, use the Pentagram 
   ritual on my Anahata Cakkram [the heart; a nerve-centre in Hindu mystical physiology. 
   --- ED.] and see if that steadies me. (P.S. --- Yes: instantly). Notice, please, 
   how in this condition of intense magical strain the most trifling things have 
   a great influence. Normally, I can eat anything in any quantity without the 
   slightest effect of any sort; witness my expeditions and debauches; nothing 
   upsets me.<br>
   P.S. --- But notice, please! Normally half a bottle of Burgundy excites me notably; 
   while doing this magic is like so much water. A "transvaluation of all 
   values!" 
 </p><p> 3.55. Over a citron presse I have revised the new Ritual. Also I have bought 
   suitable materials for copying it fair; and this I did without solemnity or 
   ceremonial, {42} but quite simply, just as anybody else might buy them. In short, 
   I bought them in a truly Rosicrucian manner, according to the custom of the 
   country. I add a few considerations on the grade of Adeptus Major 6ø = 5ø.<br>
   (P.S. --- Distinction is to be made between attainment of this<br>
   grade in the natural and in the spiritual world. The former I<br>
   long since possessed.)<br>
 </p><blockquote> 1. It may perhaps mean severe asceticism. In case I should be going 
   out on that path I will try and get a real good dinner to fortify myself.<br>
   2. The paths leading to Geburah are from Hod, that of the Hanged Man, and from 
   Tiphereth, that of Justice, both equilibrated aspects of Severity, the one implying 
   Self-Sacrifice, the other involuntary suffering. One is Freewill, the other 
   Karma; and that in a wider sense than that of Suffering.<br>
   The Ritual DCLXXI will still be applicable: indeed, it may be considered sufficient; 
   but of course it must be lived as well as performed.<br>
 </blockquote>
 (I must here complain of serious trouble with fountain pens, and the waste of 
 priceless time fixing them up. They have been wrong throughout the whole operation, 
 a thing that has not happened to me for near eight years. I hope I've got a good 
 one at last --- yes, thank God! this one writes decently.) {43} 
 <p> 4.15. Somehow or other I have got off the track; have been fooling about with 
   too many odd things, necessary as they may have been. I had better take a solid 
   hour willing the Tryst with Adonai. 
 </p><p> 5.40. Have done all this, and a Work of Kindness. I will again revise the 
   new ritual, dine, return and copy it fair for use.<br>
   Let Adonai the Lord oversee the Work, that it be perfect, a sure link with Him, 
   a certain and infallible Conjuration, and Spell, and Working of true Magick 
   Art, that I may invoke Him with success whenever seemeth good unto Him.<br>
   Unto Him; not unto Me! Is it not written that Except Adonai build the House, 
   they labour in vain that build it? 
 </p><p> 6.15. Chez Lavenue. Not feeling like revision, will read through this record.<br>
   My dinner is to be Bisque d'Ecrevisses, Tournedos Rossini, a Coupe Jack, half 
   a bottle of Meursault, and Coffee. All should now acquit adepts of the charge 
   of not knowing how to do themselves well. 
 </p><p> 7.20. Dinner over, I return the Mantra-Yoga. One may note that I expected 
   the wine to have an excessive effect on me; on the contrary, it has much less 
   effect than usual.<br>
   This is rather important. I have purposely abstained from anything that might 
   be called a drug, until now, for fear of confusing the effects.<br>
   With my knowledge of hashish-effects, I could very {44} likely have broken up 
   the Apophis-kingdom of yesterday in a moment, and the truth of it would have 
   been 5 per cent. drug and 95 per cent. magic; but nobody would have believed 
   me. Remember that this record is for the British Public, "who may like 
   me yet." God forbid! for I cannot echo Browning's hope. Their greasiness, 
   hypocrisy, and meanness are such that their appreciation could only mean my 
   vileness, not their redemption. Sorry if I seem pessimistic about them! A nasty 
   one for me, by the way, if they suddenly started buying me! I should have, in 
   mere consistency, to cut my throat!<br>
   Calm yourself, my friend! There is no danger. 
 </p><p> 7.40. At home again and robed. Am both tired and oppressed, even in my peace; 
   for the day has been, and the evening is, close and hot, with a little fog, 
   and, one may suspect, the air is overcharged with electricity. I will rest quietly 
   with my mantra as Hanged Man, and perhaps sleep for a little. 
 </p><p> 8.10. No sleep --- no rest for the wicked! 'Tis curious how totally independent 
   is mantra-yoga of reverie. I can say my mantra vigorously while my thought wanders 
   all over the world; yet I cannot write the simplest sentence without stopping 
   it, unless with a very great effort, and then it is not satisfactory to either 
   party!<br>
   Meditation --- of the "rational' sort --- on this leads me to suggest that 
   active "radiant" thought may be incompatible with the mantra, itself 
   being (?) active. One can {45} read and understand quite easily with the mantra 
   going; one can remember things.<br>
   For example, I see my watch chain; I think. "Gold. Au, 196 atomic weight. 
   AuCl3, L3 10s. 0<em>d</em>. an ounce" and so on <em>ad infinitum;</em> 
   but the act of writing down these things stops the mantra. This may be (partly) 
   because I always say under my breath each word as I write it. [P.S. --- But 
   I do so, though less possibly, as I read.] 
 </p><p> 8.22. As I am really awake, I may as well do a little Pranayama. 
 </p><p> 8.40. How little I know of magic and the conditions of success! My 17 cycles 
   of breath were not absolutely easy; yet I did them. After a big dinner!!! The 
   sweating was quite suppressed, in spite of the heat of the night and the exercise; 
   and the first symptoms of the Bhuchari-Siddhi --- the "jumping about like 
   a frog" --- were well marked. I am encouraged to spend a few minutes (still 
   in Asana) reading the Shiva Sanhita. 
 </p><p> 9.0. Asana very painful again. True, I was doing it very strictly.<br>
   I notice they give a second stage --- trembling of the body --- as preliminary 
   to the jumping about like a frog --- I had omitted this, as one is so obviously 
   the germ of the other.<br>
   The Hindus seem to lack a sense of proportion. When the Yogi, by turning his 
   tongue back for one half-minute, has conquered old age, disease and death; then 
   instead of having good time he patiently (and rather pathetically, I think!) 
   devotes his youthful {46} immortality to trying to "drink the air through 
   the crow-bill" . . . . . . . . in the hope of curing a consumption of the 
   lungs which he probably never had and which was in any case cured by his former 
   effort! 
 </p><p> 9.40. Have been practising a number of these mudras and asanas.<br>
   Concerning the Visuddi Cakkram which is "of brilliant gold or smoke colour 
   and has sixteen petals corresponding to the sixteen vowel sounds," one 
   might make a good mantra of the English vowel sounds, or the Hebrew.<br>
   "Curiouser and curiouser!" The Yogis identify the Varana (Ganges) 
   with the Ida-Nadi, the Asi (?) with the Pingala-Nadi, and Benares with the space 
   between them. Like my identification of my throat with the Gate of the cimetiere 
   du Montparnasse.<br>
   Well, it requires very considerable discrimination and a good sound foundation 
   of knowledge, if one means to get any sense at all out of these Hindu books. 
 </p><p> 10.20. A little Pranayama, I think. 
 </p><p> 10.22. Can't get steady and easy at all! Will try Hanged Man again. 
 </p><p> 10.42. Not much good. The mantra goes on, but without getting hold of<br>
   the Chakkram.<br>
   'Tis difficult to explain; the best simile I can get is that of a motor running 
   with the clutch out; or of a man cycling on a suspended machine.<br>
   There's no grip to it. {47}<br>
   The fact of the matter is, I am quite unconcentrated. Evidently the Osiris Risen 
   stage is over; and I think it is a case for violent measures.<br>
   If one were to slack off now and hope for the morning, like a shipwrecked Paul, 
   one would probably wake up a mere man of the world.<br>
   The Question then arises: What shall I do to be saved?<br>
   The only answer --- and one which is quite unconnected with the question -- 
   is that a Ritual of Adeptus Major should display the Birth of Horus and Slaying 
   of Typhon. Here again Horus and Harpocrates --- the twins of the twin signs 
   of 0ø = 0ø ritual --- are the slayers of Typhon. So all the rituals get mixed: 
   the symbols recur, though in a different aspect. Anyway, one wants something 
   a deal better than the path of Pe in 4ø = 7ø ritual.<br>
   I think the postulant should be actually scourged, tortured, branded by fire 
   for his equilibrations at the various "Stations of the Cross" or points 
   upon his mystic journey. He must assuredly drink blood for the sacrament --- 
   ah! now I see it all so well! The Initiator must kill him, Osiris; he must rise 
   again as Horus and kill the Initiator, taking his place in the ceremony thence 
   to the end. A bit awkward technically, but 'twill yield to science. They did 
   it of old by a certain lake in Italy!<br>
   Well, all this is dog-faced demon, ever seducing me from the Sacred Mysteries. 
   I can't go out and kill anybody at this time o'night! We might make a start, 
   {48} though, with a little scourging, torturing, and branding by fire. ...<br>
   Anything for a quiet life! 
 </p><p> 11.0. But scourging oneself is not easy with a robe on; and though one could 
   take it off, there is this point to be considered: that one can never (except 
   by a regrettable accident) hurt oneself more than one wants to. In other words, 
   it is impossible thus to inflict pain, and so flagellants have been rightly 
   condemned as mere voluptuaries. The only way to do so would be to inflict some 
   torture whose severity one could not gauge at the time: <em>e.g.,</em> one might 
   dip oneself in petroleum and set light to it, as the young lady mystic did --- 
   I suppose in Brittany! --- the other day. It's not the act that hurts, but the 
   consequences; so, although one knows only roughly what will happen, one can 
   force oneself to the act.<br>
   This, then, is a possible form of self-martyrdom. Similarly, mutilations; though 
   it is perhaps just to observe that all these people are mad when they do these 
   things, and their standard of pleasure and pain consequently so different from 
   the sane man's as to be incomprehensible.<br>
   Look at my Uncle Tom! who goes about the world bragging of his chastity. The 
   maniac is probably happy --- a peacock who is all tail! And squawk. Look at 
   the Vegetarians and Wallaceites and all that crew of lunatics. They are paid 
   in the coin of self- conceit. I shall waste no pity on them! {49} <br>
   11.3. Rather pity myself, who cannot even make sensible "considerations" 
   for a Ritual of Adeptus Major.<br>
   The only thing to do in short is to go steadily on, with a little extra courage 
   and energy --- no harm in that! --- on the same old lines. The Winding of the 
   Way must necessarily lead me just where it may happen to go. Why deliberately 
   go off to Geburah? Why not aspire direct by the Path of the Moon-Ray unto the 
   Ineffable Crown? Modesty is misplaced here!<br>
   Very good. Then how aspire? Who is it that standeth in the Moon-Ray? The Holy 
   Guardian Angel. Aye! O my Lord Adonai, Thou art the Beginning and the End of 
   the Path. For as Thou HB:Heh HB:Taw HB:Aleph thou art also 406 = HB:Vau HB:Taw 
   Tau the material world, the Omega. And as He HB:Aleph HB:Vau HB:Heh Thou art 
   12, the rays of the Ineffable Crown.<br>
   (A disaster has occurred; viz., a sudden and violent attack of that which demands 
   a tabloid of Pepsin, Bismuth, and Charcoal --- and gets it. On my return, 11.34, 
   I continue.)<br>
   And as HB:Yod HB:Nun HB:Aleph Ani "I" thou art also HB:Nun HB:Yod 
   HB:Aleph 2 the Negative, that is beyond these on either side!<br>
   But this illness is a nuisance. I must have got a little chill somehow. Its 
   imminence would account for my lack of concentration. And I could doubtless 
   go on gloriously, but that another disaster has occurred!<br>
   Enter Maryt, sitting and clothed and in her right mind --- or comparatively 
   so! 
 </p><p> 11.38. I suppose, then, I must quit the game for a minute or two. {50} 
 </p><p> 11.56. Got rid of her, thank God. I may say in self-defence that I would never 
   have let her in but for the accident of my being outside the room and the door 
   left open, so that she was inside on my return.<br>
   Let me get into Asana. 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"><em> The Fifth Day</em></h3>
 <p> 12.26. So beginneth the Fifth Day of this great Magical Retirement. With two 
   and twenty breath-cycles did I begin. This practice was a little easier; but 
   not much better. It ought to become quite simple and natural before one devotes 
   the half-minute of Kambhakam (breath held-in), when one is rigid to a strong 
   projection of Will toward Adonai, as has been my custom. I hope to-day will 
   be more hard definite magical Work, less discourse, less beatific state of mind 
   --- which is the very devil! the real Calypso, none the less temptress because 
   her name happens to be Penelope. Ah Lord Adonai, my Lord! Grant unto me the 
   Perfume and the Vision; let me attain the desirable harbour; for my little ship 
   is tossed by divers tempests, even by Euroclydon, in the Place where Four Winds 
   meet. 
 </p><p> 12.35. Therefore I shall go to rest, letting my mind rest ever in the Will 
   toward Adonai. Let my sleep be toward Him, or annihilation; let my waking be 
   to the music of His name; let the day be full to the uttermost of Him only. 
 </p><p> 2.18. My good friend the body woke me at this hour by means of disturbed dreams 
   about a quite imaginary {51} relative of whom nobody for years had ever seen 
   anything but his head, which he would poke out of a waterproof sheet. He was 
   supposed to be an invalid. I am glad to say that I woke properly and got quite 
   automatically on to the mantra.<br>
   My Prana, however, seems feverish and unbalanced. So I eat a biscuit or two 
   and drink some water and will put it right with the Pentagram Ritual.<br>
   2 WEH Note: This is a correction from HB:Vau HB:Yod HB:Aleph , an evident typo 
   in the original printing.<br>
   Done, but oh! how hard. Sleep fights me as Apollyon fought Christian! but I 
   will up and take him by the throat.<br>
   (See; 'tis 2.30. Twelve minutes to do that little in!)<br>
   And look at the handwriting! 
 </p><p> 3.6. How excellent is Prana Yama, a comfort to the soul! I did thirty-two 
   cycles, easy and pleasant; could have gone on indefinitely. The muscles went 
   rigid, practically of their own accord; so light did I feel that I almost thought 
   myself to be "that wise one" who "can balance himself on his 
   thumb." Sleep is conquered right away from the word "jump." Indeed, 
   if<br>
 </p><blockquote> Satan trembles when he sees<br>
   The weakest saint upon his knees;<br>
 </blockquote>
 then surely:<br>
 <blockquote> Satan flees, exclaiming "Damn!"<br>
   When any saint starts Pranayam!<br>
 </blockquote>
 So happy, indeed, was I in the practice that I devoted myself by the Waiting formula 
 to Adonai; and that I got to "neighbourhood- concentration" is shewn 
 by the fact that I several times forgot altogether about Adonai, and found myself 
 saying the silly old Mantram. {52}<br>
 I despair of asking my readers to distinguish between the common phenomenon of 
 wandering thought and this phenomenon which is at the very portal of true and 
 perfect concentration; yet it is most important that the distinction should be 
 seized. The further difficulty will occur --- I hope! --- of distinguishing between 
 the vacancy of the idiot, and that destruction of thought which we call Shivadarshana, 
 or Nirvikalpa-samadhi. [We must again refer the reader to the Hindu classics. 
 --- ED.]<br>
 The only diagnostic I can think of is this; that there is (I can't be sure about 
 it) no rational connection between the thought one left behind one and the new 
 thought. In a simple wandering during the practice of concentration one can very 
 nearly always (especially with a little experience) trace the chain. With neighbourhood-concentration 
 this is not so. Perhaps there is a chain, but so great already is the power of 
 preventing the impressions from rising into consciousness that one has no knowledge 
 of the links, each one having been automatically slaughtered on the threshold 
 of the consciousness.<br>
 Of course, the honest and wary practitioner will have no difficulty in recognising 
 the right kind of wandering; with this explanation there is no excuse for him 
 if he does.<br>
 I have another theory, though. Perhaps this is not a wandering at all, but a complete 
 annihilation of all thought. Affirming Adonai, I lop off the heads of all others; 
 and Adonai's own head falls. But in the {53} momentary pause which this causes, 
 some old habitual thought (to- night my mantra) rises up. A case of the Closure 
 followed by the Moving of the Previous Question.<br>
 Oh Lord! when wilt Thou carry a Motion to Adjourn, nay, to Prorogue, nay! to Dissolve 
 this Parliament? 
 <p> 3.32. I am not sleepy; yet will I again compose myself, devoting myself to 
   Adonai. 
 </p><p> 7.7. Again woke and continued mantra. 
 </p><p> 8.10. I ought to have made more of it at 7.7; I went off again to sleep; the 
   result is that I am rather difficult to wake again.<br>
   However, let me be vigilant now. 
 </p><p> 8.45. I have dressed and from 8.35-8.45 performed the Ritual of the Bornless 
   One.<br>
   Though I performed it none too well (failing, "e.g.", to make use 
   of the Geometric Progression on the Mahalingam formula in the Ieou section [We 
   cannot understand this passage. It presumably refers to the "Preliminary 
   Invocation" in the "Goetia" of King Solomon, published S.P.R.T., 
   Boleskine Foyers, N.B., 1904. --- ED], and not troubling even to formulate carefully 
   the Elemental Hosts, or to marshal them about the circle) I yet, by the favour 
   of IAO, obtained a really good effect, losing all sense of personality and being 
   exalted in the Pillar. Peace and ecstasy enfolded me. It is well. 
 </p><p> 8.50 But as I was ill last night, and as the morning has broken chill and 
   damp, I will go to the Cafe du Dome {54} and break my fast humbly with Coffee 
   and Sandwich. May it strengthen me in my search for the Quintessece, the Stone 
   of the Wise, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness! 
 </p><p> 9.0. I hope (by the way) that I have made it quite clear that all this time 
   even a momentary cessation of active thought has been accompanied by the rising-up 
   of the mantra. The rhythm, in short, perpetually dominates the brain; and becomes 
   active on every opportunity. The liquid Moslem mantra is much easier to get 
   on to than is the usual Hindu type with its "m" and "n" 
   sounds predominating: but it does not shake the brain up so forcibly. Perhaps 
   'tis none the worse for that. I think the unconscious training of the brain 
   to an even rhythm better than startling it into the same by a series of shocks.<br>
   I should like, to to remark that the suggestions in the "Herb Dangerous" 
   [We hope to publish this essay in No. 2 of "The Equinox" --- ED.] 
   for a ritual seem the wrong way round. It seems to me that the Eastern methods 
   are very arid, and chiefly valuable as a training of the Will, while the Ceremonies 
   of the Magic of Light tune up the soul to that harmony when it is but one step 
   to the Crown.<br>
   The real plan is, then, to train the Will into as formidable an engine as possible, 
   and then, at the moment in the Ritual when the real work should be done, to 
   fling forth flying that concentrated Will "whirling forth with re-echoing 
   Roar, so that it may comprehend with {55} invincible Will ideas omniform, which 
   flying forth from that one Fountain issued: whose Foundation is One, One and 
   Alone."<br>
   As therefore Discipline of whatever kind is only one way of going into a wood 
   at midnight on Easter Eve and cutting the magic wand with a single blow of the 
   magic knife, etc. etc. etc., we can regard the Western system as the essential 
   one. Yet of course Pranayama, for one thing, has its own definite magical effect, 
   apart from teaching the practitioner that he must last out those three seconds 
   --- those deadly long last three seconds --- even if he burst in the process.<br>
   All this I am writing during breakfast.<br>
   My devotees may note, by the way, how the desire to sleep is breaking up.<br>
   Night I. 7 1/2 hours, unbroken from 12.30.<br>
   " II. 7 hours nearly, with dreams.<br>
   " III. 8 hours nearly; but woke three or four<br>
   times, and if I had not been a worm<br>
   would have scattered it like chaff!<br>
   " IV. 6 1/2 hours; and I wake fresh.<br>
   " V. 1 3/4 + 4 1/2 + 1 hour; and real good work done<br>
   in the intervals. <br>
   [P.S. " VI. Probably 4 hours.<br>
   " VII. 2 + 2 + 1/2 hours.<br>
   " VIII. 6 hours much broken.<br>
   " IX. 1 1/2 + 2 + 2 hours.<br>
   " X. 4 + 1 1/4 hours.<br>
   " XI. 1 3/4 + 4 1/2 hours.<br>
   " XII. Back to the normal --- 7 hours perfect sleep.]<br>
   {56} 11.30. Have been walks with the mantra arranging for and modelling a "saddle" 
   whereby to get Asana really steady and easy; also for some photographs illustrating 
   some of the more absurd positions, for the instruction of my devotees.<br>
   I must now copy out the new Ritual.<br>
   This, you will readily perceive, is all wrong. Theoretically, everything should 
   be ready by the beginning of the Operation; and one should simply do it and 
   be done with it.<br>
   But this is a very shallow view. One never knows what may be required; "i.e.", 
   a beginner like myself doesn't. Further, one cannot write an effective Ritual 
   till one is already in a fairly exalted state ... and so on.<br>
   We must just do the best we can, now as always. 
 </p><p> 2.0. I have been concentrating solely on the Revision and copying of the Ritual. 
   Therefore I now live just as I always live in order to get a definite piece 
   of work done: concentrating as it were " "off" the Work. As Levi 
   also adjures us by the Holy Names.<br>
   Coming back from lunch (a dozen Marennes Vertes and an Andouillette aux Pommes) 
   I met Zelina Visconti, more lovely-ugly than ever in her wild way. She says 
   that she is favourably disposed towards me, on the recommendation of her concierge!!!<br>
   "The tongue of good report hath already been heard in his favour.<br>
   Advance, free and of good report!" {57} 
 </p><p> 4.45. And only two pages done! but the decorations "marvelious"! 
 </p><p> 5.15. Another half-hour gone! in mere titivating the Opus! and now I'm too 
   tired to as much as start Prana Yama. I will go to the Dome and see what a citron 
   press and a sandwich does for me, at the same time taking over the MS. 
   of Liber DCCCCLXIII., which has been given me to correct, and doing it.<br>
   Please the pigs, the Visconti will cheer me up in the evening; and I shall get 
   a good day in to-morrow. 
 </p><p> 6.35. Still at Liber DCCCCLXIII. [To be published shortly by "The Equinox." 
   --- ED.] I should like to write mantrams for each chapter. 
 </p><p> 7.20. Still at Liber DCCCCLXIII. I need hardly say that I am perfectly aware 
   that in one sense all this working and ritual making and copying and illuminating 
   is but a crowd of dog-faced demons, since the One Thought of Unity with Adonai 
   is absent.<br>
   But I do it on purpose, making each thing I do into that Magic Will.<br>
   So if you ask me "Are you correcting Liber DCCCCLXIII.?" I reply, 
   "No! I am Adonai!" 
 </p><p> 7.50. Arrival of the Visconti. 
 </p><p> 8.50. Departure of the Visconti. Really a necessary rest: for my head had 
   begun to ache, and her kiss, half given and half taken, much refreshed me. 
 </p><p> 9.50. Have done Liber DCCCCLXIII. 'Tis hardly thinkable that one could have 
   read it (merely) in the {58} time. Say three and a half hours! Well, if it doesn't 
   count as Tapas, and Jap, and Yama, and Niyama, and all the rest of it, all I 
   can say is that I think They don't play fair. I will now go and get something 
   to eat, and (God willing) on my return settle down to real work, for I need 
   daylight to copy my Ritual. 
 </p><p> 11.30. A sandwich and two coffees at the Versailles and a citron press 
   at the Dome, some little chatter with M---e, B---e, H---s, and others. In fact, 
   I'm a lazy unconcentrated hound. I started Mantra again, though; of course it 
   goes quite easily. 
 </p><p> 11.50. Undressed, and the mantra going, and the Will toward Adonai less unapparent.<br>
   To-day I began ill, full of spiritual pride --- look at the records of my early 
   hours! One might have thought me a great master of magic loftily condescending 
   to explain a few elementary truths suited to the capacity of his disciples.<br>
   The fact is that I am a toad, ugly and venomous, and if I do wear a precious 
   jewel in my hand, that jewel is Adonai, and --- well, come to think of it, I 
   am Adonai. But St. John is not Adonai; and St. John had better do a little humiliation 
   to-morrow.<br>
   Nothing being more humiliating than Prana Yama, I will begin with that. 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"><em>The Sixth Day</em></h3>
 <p> 12.5. Thus then --- oh ye great gods of Heaven! --- begins the Sixth Day of 
   the Great Magical Retirement of that {59} Holy Illuminated Man of God our Greatly 
   Honoured Frater, O.M., Adeptus Exemptus 7ø = 4ø Brother-Elect of the Most Secret 
   and Sublime Order A.'. A.'.<br>
   He does with great difficulty (and no interior performance) just four breath-cycles.<br>
   Somebody once remarked that it had taken a hundred million years to produce 
   me; I may add that I hope it will be another hundred million before God makes 
   such another cur. 
 </p><p> 12.15. Have performed the Equilibrating Ritual of the Scourge, the Dagger, 
   and the Chain; with the Holy Anointing Oil that bringeth the informing Fire 
   into their Lustral Water. 
 </p><p> 12.35. I am so sleepy that I cannot concentrate at all. (I was trying the 
   "Bornless One.") The magic goes well; good images and powerful, but 
   I slack right off into sleep. It's the hour for heroic measures or else to say: 
   A good night's rest, and start fresh in the morning! I suppose, as usual, I 
   shall say the first and do the second. 
 </p><p> 12.45. Have risen, washed, performed the ritual "Thee I invoke, the Bornless 
   One" physically.<br>
   The result fair. One gets better magical sight and feeling when one is performing 
   a ritual in one's Astral Body, so called. For one is on the same plane as the 
   things one's dealing with.<br>
   If, however, serious work is wanted, one must be all there. To get "materialized" 
   "spirits" --- pardon the absurd language! --- one should (nay, must!) 
   work inside {60} one's body. So, too, I think, for the highest spiritual work; 
   for that Work extends from Malkuth to Kether.<br>
   Here is the great value of the rationalistic Eastern systems. [P.S. Of course 
   scientifically worked with pencil, note-book, and stop-watch. The Yogi is usually 
   in practice just as vague a dreamer as the mystic.] They keep one always balanced 
   by common sense. One might go off on lines of pleasing illusion for years, until 
   one was lost on the "Astral Plane."<br>
   All this, observe, is very meaningless, very vague at the best. What is the 
   Astral Plane? Is there such a thing? How do its phantoms differ from those of 
   absinthe, reverie, and love, and so on?<br>
   We may admit their unsubstantiality without denying their power; the phantoms 
   of absinthe and love are potent enough to drive a man to death or marriage; 
   while reverie may end in anti- vivisectionism or nut-food-madness.<br>
   On the whole, I prefer to explain the many terrible catastrophes I have seen 
   caused by magic misunderstood by supposing that in magic one is working with 
   some very subtle and essential function of the brain, whose disease may mean 
   for one man paralysis, for another mania, for a third melancholia, for a fourth 
   death. It is not " priori" absurd to suggest that there may 
   be some one particular thought that would cause death. In the man with heart 
   disease, for instance, the thought "I will run quickly upstairs" might 
   cause death quite as directly as "I will shoot myself."<br>
   Yet of {61} course this thought acts through the will and the apparatus of nerves 
   and muscles. But might not a sudden fear cause the heart to stop? I think cases 
   are on record.<br>
   But all this is unknown ground, or, as Frank Harris would say, Unpath'd Waters. 
   We are getting dangerously near "mental arsenic" and "all --- 
   god --- good --- bones --- truth --- lights --- liver --- mind --- blessing 
   --- heart --- one and not of a series --- ante and pass the buck."<br>
   The common sense of the practical man of the world is good enough for me! 1.10. 
   Will G. R. S. Mead or somebody wise like that tell me why it is that if I get 
   out of my body and face (say) East, I can turn (in the "astral body") 
   as far as West-Sou'-West or thereabouts, but no further except with very great 
   difficulty and after long practice? In making the circle, just as I got to West, 
   I would swing right back to West-Nor'-West: turn easily enough, in short, to 
   any point but due West, within perhaps 5ø, but never pass that point. I have 
   taught myself to do it, but always with an effort.<br>
   Is this a common experience?<br>
   I connect it with my faculty of knowing direction, which all mountaineers and 
   travellers who have been with me admit to be quite exceptional.<br>
   If I leave my tent or hut by a door facing, say, South-West, throughout that 
   whole day, over all kinds of ground, through any imaginable jungle, in all kinds 
   {62} of weather, fog, blizzard, blight, by night or day, I know within 5ø (usually 
   within 2ø) the direction in which I faced when I left that tent or hut. And 
   if I happen to have observed its compass bearing, of course I can deduce North 
   by mere judgment of angle, at which I am very accurate.<br>
   Further, I keep a mental record, quite unconsciously, of the time occupied on 
   a march; so that I can always tell the time within five minutes or so without 
   consulting my watch.<br>
   Further, I have another automatic recorder which maps out distance plus direction. 
   Suppose I were to start from Scott's and walk (or drive; it's all the same to 
   me) to Haggerston Town Hall (wherever Haggerston may be; but say it's N.E.), 
   thence to Maida Vale. From Maida Vale I could take a true line for Piccadilly 
   again and not go five minutes walk out of my way, bar blind alleys, etc., and 
   I should know when I got close to Scott's again before I recognised any of the 
   surroundings.<br>
   It always seems to me that I get an intuition of the direction and length of 
   line A (Scott's to Haggerston bee-line; in spite of any winding, it would make 
   little odds if I went via Poplar), another intuition of line B (Haggerston to 
   Maida Vale), and obtained my line C (back to Scott's) by "Subliminal trigonometry."<br>
   In this example I am assuming that I had never been in London before. I have 
   done precisely similar work in dozens of strange cities, even a twisted warren 
   like Tangier or Cairo. I am worse in Paris than {63} anywhere else; I think 
   because the main thoroughfares radiate from stars, and so the angles puzzle 
   one. The power, too, suits ill with civilized life; it fades as I live in towns, 
   revives as I get back to God's good earth. A seven- foot tent and the starlight 
   --- who wants more? 
 </p><p> 1.35. Well, I've woke myself writing this. The point that really struck me 
   was this: what would happen if by severe training I forced my "astral body" 
   --- damn it! isn't there a term for it free from L. ... -prostitution? (One 
   speaks of "les deux prostitutions"; so it's all right.) My Scin-Laeca, 
   then --- what would happen if I forced my Scin-Laeca to become a Whirling Dervish? 
   I couldn't get giddy, because my Semicircular canals would be at rest.<br>
   I must really try the experiment.<br>
   [Scin-Laeca. See Lord Lytton's "Strange Story." --- ED.] 
 </p><p> 1.58. I will now devote myself to sleep, willing Adonai. Lord Adonai, give 
   me deep rest like death, so that in very few hours I may be awake and active, 
   full of lion-strength of purpose toward Thee! 
 </p><p> 7.35. My heroic conduct was nearly worth a "Nuit Blanche." For, 
   being so thoroughly awake, I had all my Prana irritated, a feeling like the 
   onset of a malarial attack, twelve hours before the temperature rises. I dare 
   say it was after 3 o'clock when I slept; I woke too, several times, and ought 
   to have risen and done Prana Yama: but I did not. O worm! the sleepiest bird 
   can easily catch "thee!" ... I am not nicely awake, though it is to 
   {64} my credit that I woke saying my mantra with vigour. 'Tis a bitter chill 
   and damp the morn; yet must I rise and toil at my fair Ritual. 
 </p><p> 7.55. Settling down to copy. 
 </p><p> 10.12. Have completed my two prescribed pages of illumination.<br>
   Will go and break my fast and do my business. 
 </p><p> 10.30. After writing letters went out and had coffee and two brioches. 
 </p><p> 11.50. At Louvre looking up some odd points in the lore of Khemi [Egypt. --- 
   ED.] for my Ritual. 
 </p><p> 12.20. I cannot understand it; but I feel faint for lack of food; I must get 
   back to strict Hatha-Yoga feeding. 
 </p><p> 1.00. Half-dozen oysters and an entrecte aux pommes. 
 </p><p> 2.05. Back to work. I am in a very low physical condition; quite equilibrated, 
   but exhausted. I can hardly walk upright!<br>
   Lord Adonai, how far I wander from the gardens of thy beauty, where play the 
   fountains of the Elixir! 
 </p><p> 2.55. Wrote two pages; the previous were not really dry; so I must wait a 
   little before illuminating.<br>
   I will rest --- if I can! In the Hanged Man posture. 
 </p><p> 4.30. I soon went to sleep and stayed there.<br>
   It is useless to persist. ... Yet I persist. 
 </p><p> 5.40. I was so shockingly cold that I went to the Dme and had milk, 
   coffee, and sandwich, eaten in Yogin manner. {65} But it has done no good as 
   far as energy is concerned. I'm just as bad or worse than I was on the day which 
   I have called the day of Apophis (third day). The only thing to my credit is 
   the way I've kept the mantra going. 
 </p><p> 5.57. One thing at least is good; if anything does come of this great magical 
   retirement --- which I am beginning to doubt --- it will not be mixed up with 
   any other enthusiasm, poetic, venereal, or bacchanalian. It will be purely mystic. 
   But as it has not happened yet --- and just at present it seems incredible that 
   it should happen --- I think we may change the subject.<br>
   .... What a fool I am, by the way! I say that "He is God, and that there 
   is no other God than He" 1800 times an hour; but I don't "think" 
   it even once a day. 
 </p><p> 6.30. All my energy has suddenly come back.<br>
   Was it that Hatha-Yoga sandwich?<br>
   I go on copying the Ritual. 
 </p><p> 7.10. Copying finished. I will go and dine, and learn it by heart, humbly 
   and thoughtfully. The illumination of it can be finished, with a little luck, 
   in two more days.<br>
   I am disinclined to use the Ritual until it is beautifully coloured. As Zoroaster 
   saith: "God is never so much turned away from man, and never so much sendeth 
   him new paths, as when he maketh ascent to divine speculations or works, in 
   a confused or disordered manner, and (as the oracle adds) with unhallowed lips, 
   or unwashed feet. For of those who are thus {66} negligent the progress in imperfect, 
   the impulses are vain, and the paths are dark." 
 </p><p> 7.40. Chez Lavenue. Bisque d'Ecrevisses, demi-perdreau  la Gele, 
   Cpes Bordelaise, Coupe Jack. Demi Clos du Roi. I am sure I made a serious 
   mistake in the beginning of this Operation of Magick Art. I ought to have performed 
   a true Equilibration by an hour's Prana Yama in Asana (even if I had to do it 
   without Kambhakham) at midnight, dawn, noon, and sunset, and I should have allowed 
   nothing in heaven above, or in earth beneath, or in the waters under the earth, 
   to have interfered with its due performance.<br>
   Instead I thought myself such a fine fellow that to get into Asana for a few 
   minutes every midnight and the rest go-as-you- please would be enough. I am 
   well punished. 
 </p><p> 8.30. This food, eaten in a Yogin and ceremonial manner, is doing me good. 
   I shall end, God willing, with coffee, cognac, and cigar. It is a fatal error 
   to knock the body to pieces and leave the consciousness intact, as has been 
   the case with me all day. It is true that some people find that if they hurt 
   the body, they make the mind unstable. True; they predispose it to hallucination.<br>
   One should use strictly corporeal methods to tame the body; strictly mental 
   methods to control the mind. This latter restriction is not so vitally important. 
   Any weapon is legitimate against a public enemy like the mind. No truce nor 
   quarter! {67} On the contrary, to use the spiritual forces to secure health, 
   as certain persons attempt to do to-day, is the vilest black magic. This is 
   one of the numerous reasons for supposing that Jesus Christ was a Brother of 
   the Left-Hand Path. Now my body has been treating me well, waking nicely at 
   convenient hours, sleeping at suitable times, keeping itself to itself ... an 
   admirable body. Then why shouldn't I take it out and give it the best dinner 
   Lavenue can serve? ... Provided that it doesn't stop saying that mantra!<br>
   It would be so easy to trick myself into the belief that I had attained! It 
   would be so easy to starve myself until there was "visions about"! 
   It would be so easy to write a sun-splendid tale of Adonai my Lord and my lover, 
   so as to convince the world and myself that I had found Him! With my poetic 
   genius, could I not outwrite St. John (my namesake) and Mrs. Dr. Anna Bonus 
   Kingsford? Yea, I could deceive myself if I did not train and fortify my scepticism 
   at every point. That is the great usefulness of this record; one will be able 
   to see afterwards whether there is any trace of poetic or other influence. But 
   this is my sheet-anchor: I cannot wrote a lie, either in poetry or about magic. 
   These are serious things that constitute my personality; and I could more easily 
   blow out my brains that write a poem which I did not feel. The apparent exception 
   is in case of irony.<br>
   [P.S. I wonder whether it would be possible to draw up a mathematical table, 
   showing curves of food (and {68} digestion), drink, other physical impulses, 
   weather, and so on, and comparing them with the curve of mystic enthusiasm and 
   attainment. Through it is perhaps true that perfect health and "bien-tre" 
   are the bases of any true trance or rapture, it seems unlikely that mere exuberance 
   of the former can excite the latter.<br>
   In other words there is probably some first matter of the work which is not 
   anything we know of as bodily. On my return to London, I must certainly put 
   the matter before more experienced mathematicians, and if possible, get a graphic 
   analysis of the kind indicated.] 
 </p><p> 9.20. How difficult and expensive it is to get drunk, when one is doing magic! 
   Nothing exhilarates or otherwise affects one. Oh, the pathos and tragedy of 
   those lines:<br>
   Come where the booze is cheaper!<br>
   Come where the pots hold more!<br>
   How I wish I had written them! 
 </p><p> 10.08. Having drunk a citron press and watched the poker game at the 
   Dme for a little, I now return home. I thought to myself, "Let me 
   chuck the whole thing overboard and be sensible, and get a good night's rest" 
   --- and perceived that it would be impossible. I am so far into this Operation 
   that<br>
   pausing to cast one last glance back<br>
   O'er the safe road --- 'twas gone! {69}<br>
   I must come out of it either an Adept or a maniac. Thank the Lord for that! 
   It saves trouble. 
 </p><p> 10.20. Undressed and robed. Will do an Aspiration in the Hanged Man position, 
   hoping to feel rested and fit by midnight.<br>
   The Incense has arrived from London; and I feel its magical effects most favourable.<br>
   O creature of Incense! I conjure thee by Him that sitteth upon the Holy Throne 
   and liveth and reigneth for ever as the Balance of Righteousness and Truth, 
   that thou comfort and exalt my soul with Thy sweet perfume, that I may be utterly 
   devoted to this Work of the Invocation of my Lord Adonai, that I may fully attain 
   thereto, beholding Him face to face --- as it is written "Before there 
   was Equilibrium, Countenance beheld not Countenance" --- yea, being utterly 
   absorbed in His ineffable Glory --- yea, being That of which there is no Image 
   either in speech or thought. 
 </p><p> 10.55. What a weary world we live in! No sooner am I betrayed into making 
   a few flattering remarks about my body that I find everything wrong with it, 
   and two grains of Cascara Sagrada necessary to its welfare!<br>
   .... I wish I knew where I was! I don't at all recognise what Path I am on; 
   it doesn't seem like a Path at all. As far as I can see, I am drifting rudderless 
   and sailless on a sea of no shore --- the False Sea of the Qliphoth. For in 
   my stupidity I began to try a certain ritual of the Evil Magic, so called. ...<br>
   Not {70} evil in truth, because only that is evil (in one sense) which does 
   not lead to Adonai. (In another sense, all is evil which is not Adonai.) And 
   of course I had the insane idea that this ritual would serve to stimulate my 
   devotion. For the information of the Z.A.M., I may explain that this ritual 
   pertained to Saturn in Libra; and, though right enough in its own plane, is 
   a dog-faced demon in this operation. Is it, though? I am so blind that I can 
   no longer decide the simplest problems. Else, I see so well, and am so balanced, 
   that I see both sides of every question.<br>
   In chess-blindness one used to abjure the game. I never tried to stick it through; 
   I wish I had. Anyhow, I have to stick this through!<br>
   O Lord of the Eye, let thine Eye be ever open upon me! For He that watcheth 
   Israel doth not slumber nor sleep!<br>
   Lord Shiva, open Thou the Eye upon me, and consume me altogether in its brilliance!<br>
   Destroy this Universe! Eat up thine hermit in thy terrible jaws!<br>
   Dance Thou upon this prostrate saint of Thine!<br>
   ... I suffer from thirst ... it is a thirst of the body ... yet the thirst of 
   the soul is deeper, and impossible to quench.<br>
   Lord Adonai! Let the Powers of Geburah plunge me again and again into the Fires 
   of Pain, so that my steel may be tempered to that Sword of Magic that invoketh 
   Thy Knowledge and Thy Conversation.<br>
   Hoor! Elohim Gibor! Kamael! Seraphim! Graphiel! {71}<br>
   Bartzabel! Madim! I conjure ye in the Number Five.<br>
   By the Flaming Star of my Will! By the Senses of my Body! By the Five Elements 
   of my Being! Rise! Move! Appear! Come ye forth unto me and torture me with your 
   fierce pangs ... for why? because I am the Servant of the Same your God, the 
   True Worshipper of the Highest.<br>
   Ol sonuf vaoresaji, gono ladapiel, elonusaha caelazod.<br>
   I rule above ye, said the Lord of Lords, exalted in power.<br>
   [From Dr. Dee's MSS. --- ED.] 
 </p><p> 11.17. Will now try the Hanged Man again. 
 </p><p> 11.30. Very vigorous and good, my willing of Adonai. ... I should like to 
   explain the difficulty. It would be easy enough to form a magical Image of Adonai: 
   and He would doubtless inform it. But it would only be an Image. This may be 
   the meaning of the commandment "Thou shalt not make any graven image," 
   etc., just as "Thou shalt not have any other Gods but me" implies 
   single-minded devotion (Ekagrata) to Adonai. So any mental or magical Image 
   must necessarily fall short of the Truth. Consequently one has to will that 
   which is formless; and this is very difficult. To concentrate the mind upon 
   a definite thing is hard enough; yet at least there is something to grasp, and 
   some means of checking one's result. But in this case, the moment one's will 
   takes a magical shape -- and the will simply revels in creating shapes -- at 
   the moment one knows that one has gone off the track. {72} This is of course 
   (nearly enough) another way of expressing the Hindu Meditation whose method 
   is to kill all thoughts as they arise in the mind. The difference is that I 
   am aiming at a target, while they are preventing arrows from striking one. In 
   my aspiration to know Adonai, I resemble their Yogis who concentrate on their 
   "personal Lord"; but at the same time it must be remembered that I 
   am not going to be content with what would content them. In other words, I am 
   going to "define" "the Knowledge and Conversation of my Holy 
   Guardian Angel" as equal to Neroda-Samapatti, the trance of Nibbana.<br>
   I hope I shall be able to live up to this! 
 </p><p> 11.55. Have been practising Asana, etc. I forgot one thing in the last entry: 
   I had been reproaching Adonai that for six days I had evoked Him in vain. ... 
   I got the reply, "The Seventh Day shall be the Sabbath of the Lord thy 
   God."<br>
   So mote it be! 
 </p><h3 class="title" align="center">The Seventh Day.</h3>
 12.17. I began this great day with Eight breath-cycles; was stopped by the indigestion 
 trouble in its other form. (P.S. --- Evidently the introduction of the Cascara 
 into my sensitive aura made its action instantaneous.) My breathing passages were 
 none too clear, either; I have evidently taken a chill.<br>
 Now, O, my Lord Adonai, thou Self-Glittering One, wilt Thou not manifest unto 
 Thy chosen one? For see {73} me! I am as a little white dove trembling upon thine 
 altar, its throat stretched out to the knife. I am as a young child bought in 
 the slave market ... and night is fallen! I await Thee, O my Lord, with a great 
 longing, stronger than Life; yet am I as patient as Death.<br>
 There was a certain Darwesh whose turban a thief stole. But when they said to 
 him, "See! he hath taken the road to Damascus!" that holy man answered, 
 as he went quietly to the cemetery, "I will await him here!"<br>
 So, therefore, there is one place, O thou thief of my heart's love, Adonai, to 
 which thou must come at last; and that place is the tomb in which lie buried all 
 my thoughts and emotions, all that which is "I, and Me, and Mine." There 
 will I lay myself and await thee, even as our Father Christian Rosenkreutz that 
 laid himself in the Pastos in the Vault of the Mountain of the Caverns, Abiegnus, 
 on whose portal did he cause to be written the words, "Post Lux Crucis Annos 
 Patebo." So Thou wilt enter in (as did Frater N. N. and his companions) and 
 open the Pastos; and with thy Winged Globe thou wilt touch the Rosy Cross upon 
 my breast, and I shall wake into life --- the true life that is Union with Thee.<br>
 So therefore --- perinde ac cadaver --- I await Thee. 
 <p> 12.43. I wrote, by the way, on some previous day (IV. 12.57 A.M.) that I used 
   the Supreme formula of Awaiting. ... Ridiculous mouse! is it not written in 
   the Book of the {74} Heart that is girt about with the Serpent that "To 
   await Thee is the End, not the Beginning"?<br>
   It is as silly as rising at midnight, and saying, "I will go out and sleep 
   in the sun."<br>
   But I am an Irishman, and if you offer me a donkey-ride at a shilling the first 
   hour and sixpence the second, you must not be surprised at the shrewd silliness 
   of my replying that I will take the second hour first.<br>
   But that is always the way; the love of besting our dearest friends in a bargain 
   is native to us: and so, even in religion, when we are dealing with our own 
   souls, we try to cheat. I go out to cut an almond rod at midnight, and, finding 
   it inconvenient, I "magically affirm" that ash is almond and that 
   seven o'clock is twelve. It seems a pity to have become a magician, capable 
   of forcing Nature to accommodate herself to your statements, for no better use 
   to be made of the power than this!<br>
   Miracles are only legitimate when there is no other issue possible. It is waste 
   of power (the most expensive kind of power) to "make the spirits bring 
   us all kinds of food" when we live next door to the Savoy; that Yogi was 
   a fool who spent forty years learning to walk across the Ganges when all his 
   friends did it daily for two pice; and that man does ill when he invokes Tahuti 
   to cure a cold in the head while Mr. Lowe's shop is so handy in Stafford Street.<br>
   But miracles may be performed in an extremity; and are.<br>
   This brings us round in a circle; the miracle of the {75}<br>
   Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel is only to be performed 
   when the magus has rowed himself completely out; in the language of the Tarot, 
   when the Magus has become the Fool. But for my faith in the Ritual DCLXXI. I 
   should be at the end of my spells.<br>
   Well? We shall see in the upshot. 
 </p><p> 1.25. I really almost begin to believe IT will happen.<br>
   For I lay down quite free of worry or anxiety (hugging myself, as it were), 
   perfectly sure of Him in the simple non-assertive way that a child is sure of 
   its mother, in a state of pleased expectancy, my thoughts quite suppressed in 
   an intent listening, as it were for the noise of the wind of His chariot, as 
   it were for the rustle of His wings.<br>
   For lo! through the heaven of Nu He rideth in His chariot --- soon, soon He 
   will be here!<br>
   Into this state of listening come certain curious things --- formless flittings, 
   I know not what. Also, what I used to call "telephone-cross" voices 
   --- voices of strange people saying quite absurd commonplace things --- "Here, 
   let's feel it!" "What about lunch?" "So I said to him: Did 
   you ..." and so on; just as if one were overhearing a conversation in a 
   railway carriage. I beheld also Kephra, the Beetle God, the Glory of Midnight. 
   But let me compose myself again to sleep, as did the child Samuel.<br>
   If He should choose to come, He can easily awaken me. {76} 
 </p><p> 3.35. I have been asleep a good deal --- one long dream in which P---t, Lord 
   M---y of B---n and my wife are all staying with me in my mother's house. My 
   room the old room, with one page torn out --- for I conceived it as part of 
   a book, somehow! Oh such a lot of this dream! Most of it clearly due to obvious 
   sources --- I don't see where Lord M---y comes in. Very likely he is dead. I 
   have had that happen now and again. [P.S. --- this was not the case.]<br>
   The dream changed, too, to a liner; where Japanese stole my pipe in a series 
   of adventures of an annoying type --- every one acted as badly as he knew how, 
   and as unexpectedly.<br>
   Waking just now, and instantly concentrating on Adonai, I found my body seized 
   with a little quivering, very curious and pleasant, like<br>
   trembling leaves in a continuous air.<br>
   I think I have heard this state of Interior Trembling described<br>
   in some mystic books. I think the Shakers and Quakers had<br>
   violent shudderings. Abdullah Haji of Shiraz writes: ---<br>
 </p><blockquote> Just as the body shudders when the Soul<br>
   Gives up to Allah in its quick career<br>
   Itself. ...</blockquote>
 <br>
 It is the tiniest, most intimate trembling, not unlike that of Kambhakham or "Vindu-siddhi" 
 [see the Shiva Sanhita. --- ED.] properly performed; but of a female quality. 
 I feel as if I were being shaken; in {77} the other cases I recognize my own ardour 
 as the cause. It is very gentle and sweet.<br>
 So now I may turn back to wait for Him. 
 <p> 3.50. The Voice of the Nadi has changed to a music faint yet very full and 
   very sweet, with a bell-like tone more insistent than the other notes at intervals. 
 </p><p> 5.45. Again awake, and patient-eager. The dreams flow through me ceaselessly.<br>
   This time a house where I, like a new Bluebeard, have got to conceal my wives 
   from each other. But my foolish omission to knife them brings it about that 
   I have thirty-nine secret chambers, and only one open one in each case.<br>
   Oh, yards of it! And all sorts of people come in to supper --- which there isn't 
   any, and we have to do all sorts of shifts --- and all the wives think themselves 
   neglected --- as they are bound to do, if one is insane enough to have forty 
   --- and I loathed them all so! it was terrible having to fly round and comfort 
   and explain; the difficulty increases (I should judge) as about the fifth power 
   of the number of wives... I'm glad I'm awake!<br>
   Yea, and how glad when I am indeed awake from this glamour life, awake to the 
   love my Lord Adonai!<br>
   It is bitter chill at dawn. A consecrating cold it seems to me --- yet I will 
   not confront it and rejoice in it --- I am already content, having ceased to 
   strive. 
 </p><p> 7.15. Again awake, deliciously rested and refreshed. 
 </p><p> 9.45. Again awake, ditto. {78} 
 </p><p> 11.35. I will now break my fast with a sandwich and coffee, eaten Yogin- wise.<br>
   I seem like one convalescent after a fever; very calm, very clean, rather weak, 
   too weak, indeed, to be actually happy: but content.<br>
   I spent the morning posing for Michael Brenner, a sculptor who will one day 
   be heard of. Very young yet, but I think the best man of his generation --- 
   of those whose work I have seen. By the way, I am suffering from a swollen finger, 
   since yesterday morning or possibly earlier. I have given it little attention, 
   but it is painful.<br>
   I want to explain why I have so carefully recorded the somewhat banal details 
   of all I have eaten and drunk.<br>
 </p><blockquote>1. All food is a species of intoxicant; hence a fruitful source of 
   error. Should I obtain any good result, I might say "You were starved" 
   or "You were drunk." It is very easy to get visions of sorts by either 
   process, and to delude oneself into the idea that one has attained, mistaking 
   the Qliphoth for Kether.<br>
   2. In keeping the vow "I will interpret every phenomenon as a particular 
   dealing of God with my soul" the mere animal actions are the most resistant. 
   One cannot see the nature of the phenomenon; it seems so unimportant; one is 
   inclined to despise it. Hence I enter it in the record as a corrective. {79}<br>
   3. If others are to read this, I should like them to see that elaborate codes 
   of morality have nothing to do with my system. No question of sin and grace 
   ever enters it.<br>
 </blockquote>
 If a chemist wants to prepare copper sulphate from its oxide, he does not hesitate 
 on the ground that sulphuric acid, thrown in the eyes, hurts people. So I use 
 the moral drug which will produce the desired result, whether that drug be what 
 people commonly call poison or no. In short, I act like a sensible man; and I 
 think I deserve every credit for introducing this completely new idea into religion. 
 <p> 12.25. That function of my brain which says "You ought to be willing 
   Adonai" sometimes acts. But I am willing Him! It is so active because all 
   this week it has been working hard, and doesn't realise that its work is done. 
   Just as a retired grocer wakes up and thinks "I must go and open the shop."<br>
   In Hindu phrase, the thought-stuff, painfully forced all these days into one 
   channel, has acquired the habit ["i.e.", of flowing naturally in it. 
   --- ED.] I am Ekagrata --- one-pointed.<br>
   Just as if one arranges a siphon, one has to suck and suck for a while, and 
   then when the balance in the two arms of the tube is attained, the fluid goes 
   on softly and silently of its own act. Gravitation which was against us is now 
   for us.<br>
   So now the whole destiny of the Universe is by me overcome; I am impelled, with 
   ever-gathering and irresistible force, toward Adonai. {80}<br>
   Vi Veri Vniversvm Vivvs Vici! 
 </p><p> 12.57. Back home to illuminate my beautiful Ritual. 
 </p><p> 3.30. Two pages done and set aside to dry. I think I will go for a little 
   walk and enjoy the beautiful sun.<br>
   Also to the chemist's to have my finger attended to. 
 </p><p> 4.05. The chemist refused to do anything; and so I did it myself. It is the 
   romantic malady of ingrowing nail; a little abscess had formed. Devilish painful 
   after the clean-up. Will go the walk aforesaid. 
 </p><p> 4.17. I ought to note how on this day there is a complete absence of all one's 
   magical apparatus. The mantra has slowed down to (at a guess) a quarter of its 
   old pace. The rest in unison. This is because the feeling of great power, etc. 
   etc., is the mere evidence of conflict --- the thunder of the guns. Now all 
   is at peace; the power of the river, no more a torrent.<br>
   The Concourse of the Forces has become the Harmony of the Forces; the word Tetragrammation 
   is spoken and ended; the holy letter Shin is descended into it. For the roaring 
   God of Sinai we have the sleeping Babe of Bethlehem. A fulfilment, not a destroying, 
   of the Law. 
 </p><p> 4.45. Am at home again. I will lie down in the Position of the Hanged Man, 
   and await the coming of my Lord. 
 </p><p> 6.00. Arisen again to go out to diner. I was half-asleep some of the time. 
 </p><p> 6.15. Dinner --- Hors d'OEuvre --- Tripes  la Mode de Caen --- Filet 
   de Porc --- Glace --- 1/2 Graves. Oh, how the world {81} hath inflexible intellectual 
   rulers! I eat it in a semi-Yogin manner. 
 </p><p> 6.20. I am wondering whether I have not made a mistake in allowing myself 
   to sleep.<br>
   It would be just like me, if there were only one possible mistake to make, to 
   make it! I was perfect, had I only watched. But I let my faith run away with 
   me. ... I wonder. 
 </p><p> 6.45. Dinner over, I go on as I am in calm faith and love. Why should I expect 
   a catastrophic effect? Why should not the circumstances of Union with God be 
   compatible with the normal consciousness? Interpenetrating and illuminating 
   it, if you like; but not destroying it. Well, I don't know why it shouldn't 
   be; but I bet it isn't! All the spiritual experience I have had argues against 
   such a theory.<br>
   On the contrary, it will leave the reason quite intact, supreme Lord of its 
   own plane. Mixing up the planes is the sad fate of many a mystic. How many do 
   I know in my own experience who tell me that, obedient to the Heavenly Vision, 
   they will shoot no more rabbits! Thus they found a system on trifles, and their 
   Lord and God is some trumpery little elemental masquerading as the Almighty.<br>
   I remember my Uncle Tom telling me that he was sure God would be displeased 
   to see me in a blue coat on Sunday. And to-day he is surprised and grieved that 
   I do not worship his god --- or even my own tailor, as would be surely more 
   reasonable! {82} 
 </p><p> 7.32. How is it that I expect the reward at once? Surely I am presuming on 
   my magical power, which is an active thing, and therefore my passivity is not 
   perfect. Of course, when IT happens, it happens out of time and space --- now 
   or ten years hence it is all the same. All the same to IT; not all the same 
   to me, O.M. So O.M. (the dog!) persists irrationally in wanting IT, here and 
   now. Surely, indeed, it is a lack of faith, a pandering to the time-illusion 
   ... and so forth. Yes, no doubt it is all magically wrong, even magically absurd; 
   yet, though I see the snare, I deliberately walk into it. I suppose I shall 
   be punished somehow ... Good! there's the excuse I wanted. Fear is failure: 
   I must dare to do wrong. Good! 
 </p><p> 7.50. It has just occurred to me that this Waiting and Watching is the supreme 
   Magical strain. Every slight sound or other impression shocks one tremendously. 
   It is easy enough to shut out sounds and such when one is concentrating in active 
   magic: I did all my early evocations in Chancery Lane. But now one is deliberately 
   opening all the avenues of sense to admit Adonai! One has destroyed one's own 
   Magic Circle. The whole of that great Building is thrown down. ... Therefore 
   I am in a worse hole that I ever was before --- and I've only just realized 
   it. A footfall on the pavement is most acute agony --- because it is not Adonai. 
   My hearing, normally rather dull, is intensely sharpened; and I am thirty yards 
   from the electric trams of the Boulevard Montparnasse at the busiest hour of 
   the evening. ... {83}<br>
   And the Visconti may turn up! ...<br>
   Eli, Eli, lama sabacthani! 
 </p><p> 8.45. I went out to the Dme to drink my final citron press and 
   to avoid the Visconti. Am returned, and in bed. I shall try and sleep now, waking 
   in time for midnight and the quiet hours. 
 </p><p> 8.53. I have endured the supreme temptation and assault of the Enemy.<br>
   In this wise. First, I found that I did not want sleep --- I couldn't stop "Waiting." 
   Next, I said "Since last night that Black Ritual (see entry 10.55) did 
   at least serve to turn all my thoughts to the One Thought, I will try it again 
   ..."<br>
   Then I said: "No; to do so is not pure 'waiting.'"<br>
   And then --- as by a flash of lightning --- the Abyss of the Pit opened, and 
   my whole position was turned. I saw my life from the dawn of consciousness till 
   now as a gigantic "pose"; my very love of truth assumed for the benefit 
   of my biographer! All these strange things suffered and enjoyed for no better 
   purpose than to seem a great man. One cannot express the horror of this thought; 
   it is The thought that murders the soul --- and there is no answer to it. So 
   universal is it that it is impossible to prove the contrary. So one must play 
   the man, and master it and kill it utterly, burying it in that putrid hell from 
   which it sprang. Luckily I have dealt with it before. Once when I lived at Paddington 
   J---s and F---r were with me taking, and, when they went, thoughtfully left 
   this devil-thought behind --- the agony is with me yet. {84} That, though, was 
   only a young mild devil, though of the same bad brood. It said: "Is there 
   any Path or Attainment? Have you been fooled all along?"<br>
   But to-night's thought struck at my own integrity, at the inmost truth of the 
   soul and of Adonai.<br>
   As I said, there is no answer to it; and as these seven days have left me fairly 
   master of the fortress, I caught him young, and assigned him promptly to the 
   oubliette.<br>
   I put down this --- not as a "pose" --- but because the business is 
   so gigantic. It encourages me immensely; for if my Dweller on the Threshold 
   be that most formidable devil, how vast must be the Pylon that shelters him, 
   and how glorious must be the Temple just beyond! 9.30. It seems that there was 
   one more mistake to make; for I've made it!<br>
   I started to attempt to awaken the Kundalini --- the magical serpent that sleeps 
   at the base of the spine; coiled in three coils and a half around the Sushumna; 
   and instead of pumping the Prana up and down the Sushumna until Siva was united 
   with Sakti in the Sahasrara-Cakkram, I tried --- God knows why; I'm stupider 
   than an ass or H ... C .... --- to work the whole operation in Muladhara --- 
   with the obvious result.<br>
   There are only two more idiocies to perform --- one, to take a big dose of Hashish 
   and record the ravings as if they were Samadhi; and two, to go to church. I 
   may as well give up. {85} Yet here answers me the everlasting Yea and Amen: 
   Thou canst not give up, for I will bring thee through. Yet here I lie, stripped 
   of all magic force, doubting my own peace and faith, farther from Adonai than 
   ever before --- and yet --- and yet ---<br>
   Do I not know that every error is a necessary step in the Path? The longest 
   way round is the shortest way home. But it is disgusting! There's a grim humour 
   in it, too. The real Devil of the Operation must be sitting with sardonic grin 
   upon his face, enjoying my perplexity ---<br>
   For that Dweller-of-the-Threshold-thought was not as dead as I supposed; as 
   I write he comes again and again, urging me to quit the Path, to abandon the 
   unequal contest. Luckily, friend Dweller, you prove too much! Your anxiety shows 
   me that I am not as far from attainment as my own feelings would have me think. 
   At least, though, I am thrown into the active again; I shall rise and chant 
   the Enochian Calls and invoke the Bornless One, and clear a few of the devils 
   away, and get an army of mighty angels around me --- in short, make another 
   kind of fool of myself, I wonder?<br>
   Anyway, I'll do it. Not a bad idea to ask Thoth to send me Taphtatharath with 
   a little information as to the route --- I do not know where I am at all. This 
   is a strange country, and I am very lonely.<br>
   This shall be my ritual.<br>
 </p><blockquote> 1. Banishing Pentagram Ritual.<br>
   2. Invoking ditto. [These will appear in No. 2, "Liber O." --- ED.] 
   {86}<br>
   3. "The Bornless One." [See the "Goetia." --- ED.]<br>
   4. The Calls I --- VI with the rituals of the five Grades. [From Dr. Dee's and 
   the G.'. D.'. MSS. --- ED.]<br>
   5. Invocation of Thoth.<br>
   6. (No: I will "not" use the New Ritual, nor will I discuss the matter.) 
   An impromptu invocation of Adonai.<br>
   7. Closing formulae.<br>
 </blockquote>
 To work, then! 
 <p> 11.15. The ceremony went well enough; the forces invoked came readily and 
   visibly; Thoth in particular as friendly as ever --- I fancy He takes this record 
   as a compliment to Him --- He's welcome to it, poor God!<br>
   The L.V.X. came, too but not enough to pierce the awful shroud of darkness that 
   by my folly I have woven for myself.<br>
   So at the end I found myself on the floor, so like Rodin's Cruche Casse 
   Danaide Girl as never was ... As I ought to have been in the beginning! Well, 
   one thing I got (again!), that is, that when all is said and done, I am that 
   I am, and all these thoughts of mine, angels and devils both, are only fleeting 
   moods of me. The one true self of me is Adonai. Simple! Yet I cannot remain 
   in that simplicity.<br>
   I got this "revelation" through the Egyptian plane, a partial illumination 
   of the reason. It has cleared up the mind; but alas! the mind is still there. 
   This is the strength and weakness both of the Egyptian plane, {87} that it is 
   so lucid and spiritual and yet so practical. When I say weakness, I mean that 
   it appeals to my weakness; I am easily content with the smaller results, so 
   that they seduce me from going on to the really big ones. I am quite happy as 
   a result of my little ceremony --- whereas I ought to be taking new and terrible 
   oaths! Yet why should Tahuti be so kind to me, and Asar Un-nefer so unkind? 
   The answer comes direct from Tahuti himself: Because you have learned to write 
   perfectly, but have not yet taught yourself to suffer.<br>
   True enough, the last part!<br>
   Asar Un-nefer, thou perfected One, teach me Thy mysteries! Let my members be 
   torn by Set and devoured by Sebek and Typhon! Let my blood be poured out upon 
   Nile, and my flesh be given to Besz to devour! Let my Phallus be concealed in 
   the maw of Mati, and my Crown be divided among my brethren! Let the jaws of 
   Apep grind me into poison! Let the sea of poison swallow me wholly up!<br>
   Let Asi my mother rend her robes in anguish, and Nepti weep for me unavailing.<br>
   Then shall Asi being forth Hoor, and Heru-pa-kraat shall leap glad from her 
   womb. The Lord of Vengeance shall awaken; Sekhet shall roar, and Pasht cry aloud. 
   Then shall my members be gathered together, and my bonds shall be unloosed; 
   and my khu shall be mighty in Khem for ever and ever! 
 </p><p> 11.37. I return to he place of the Evil Triad, of Ommo Satan, that is<br>
   before the altar. There to expiate my folly in {88} attaching<br>
   myself to all this great concourse of ideas that I have here<br>
   recorded, instead of remaining fixed in the single stronghold of<br>
   Unity with Myself. 
 </p><p> 11.54. And so this great day draws to its end.<br>
   These are indeed the Qliphoth, the Qliphoth of Kether, the Thaumiel, twin giant 
   heads that hate and tear each other.<br>
   For the horror and darkness have been unbelievable; yet again, the light and 
   brilliance have been almost insupportable.<br>
   I was never so far, and never so near ... But the hour approaches. Let me collect 
   myself, and begin the new day in affirmation of my Unity with my Lord Adonai! 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"><em>The Eighth Day</em></h3>
 <p> 12.3. Thus the Eighth day, the Second Week, begins. I am in Asana.<br>
   For some reason or other, Pranayama is quite easy. Concentrating on Adonai, 
   I was in Kambhakham for a whole minute without distress.<br>
   It "is" true, by the way. I was --- and am --- in some danger of looking 
   on this Record as a Book; "i.e.", of emphasising things for their 
   literary effect, and diminishing the importance of others which lend themselves 
   less obviously.<br>
   But the answer to this, friend Satan! is that the Canon of Art is Truth, and 
   the Canon of Magic is Truth; my true record will make a good book, and my true 
   book will make a good record. {89} " "Ekam evam advaitam!" friend 
   Satan! One and not two. "Hua allahu"<br>
   "alazi lailaha illa Hua!"<br>
   But what shall by my "considerations" for this week? I am so absolutely 
   become as a pantomorphous Lynx that all things look alike to me; there are just 
   as many pros and cons to Pranayama as to Ceremonial, etc. etc., --- and the 
   pros and cons are so numerous and far reaching that I simply dare not start 
   discussing even one. I can see an endless avenue in every case. In short, like 
   the hashish-drunkard in full blast, I am overwhelmed by the multitude of my 
   own magical Images. I have become the great Magician --- Mayan, the Maker of 
   Illusion --- the Lord of the Brethren of the Left-hand Path.<br>
   I don't "wear my iniquity as an aureole, deathless in Spiritual Evil," 
   as Mr. Waite thinks; but it's nearly as bad as that. There seems only one reply 
   to this great question of the Hunchback (I like to symbolize the spirit of Questioning 
   by "?" --- a little crooked thing that asks questions) and that is 
   to keep on affirming Adonai, and refusing to be obsessed by any images of discipline 
   or magic.<br>
   Of course! but this is just the difficulty --- as it was in the Beginning, is 
   now, and every shall be, world without end! My beautiful answer to the question, 
   How will you become a millionaire? is: I will possess a million pounds. The 
   "answer" is not an answer; it is a begging of the question.<br>
   What a fool I am! and people think me clever. "Ergo," perhaps! {90}<br>
   Anyhow I will now (12.37) go quietly to sleep --- as I am always saying, and 
   never do when I say it! --- in the hope that daylight may bring counsel. 
 </p><p> 7.40. Woke fresh and comfortable. Sleep filled with dreams and broken into 
   short lengths. I ought to observe that this is a very striking result of forging 
   this magic chain; for in my normal life I am one of the soundest sleepers imaginable. 
   Nine solid hours without turning once is my irreducible minimum. 
 </p><p> 9.10. Having done an hour's illumination of the New Ritual, will go and break 
   my fast with coffee and a brioche, and thence proceed to Michael Brenner's studio. 
 </p><p> 12.15. I have spent the morning in modelling Siddhasana --- a more difficult 
   task than appeared. Rather like THE task!<br>
   But I went on with the mantra, and made some Reflections upon Kamma.<br>
   I will now have a Yogin coffee and sandwich, and return to my illumination of 
   the Ritual.<br>
   In the desert of my soul, where no herb grows, there is yet one little spring. 
   I am still one-pointed, at least in the lower sense that I have no desire or 
   ambition but this of accomplishing the Great Work.<br>
   Barren is this soul of mine, in these 3 1/2 years of drought (the 3 1/2 coils 
   of the Kundalini are implied by this) and this Ekagrata is the little cloud 
   like a hand (Yod, the Lingam of great Shiva). And, though I catch up my robe 
   and run before the chariot of the King into Jezreel, it may be {91} that before 
   I reach those gates the whole sky may be one black flame of thundercloud, and 
   the violet swords of the lightning may split asunder its heavy womb, and the 
   rain, laughing like a young child, may dance upon the desert! 
 </p><p> 12.58. The Light beginneth to dawn upon the Path, so that I see a little better 
   where I stand. This whole journey seems under some other formula than IAO --- 
   perhaps a Pentagram formula with which I am not clearly acquainted. If I knew 
   the Word of the Grade, I could foretell things: but I don't.<br>
   I think I will read through the whole Record to date and see if I can find an 
   Ariadne-clue. 
 </p><p> 1.15. Back, and settled to Ritual-painting. 
 </p><p> 2.30. Finished: bar frontispiece and colophon, which I can design and execute 
   to-morrow. 
 </p><p> 3.0. Took half an hour off, making a silly sketch of a sunset. Will now read 
   through the Record, and Reflect upon it. 
 </p><p> 4.15. "Before I was blind; now I see!" Yesterday I was right up 
   to the Threshold, right enough; but got turned back by the Dweller. I did not 
   see the Dweller till afterwards (8.53 entry) for he was too subtle. I will look 
   carefully back to try and spot him; for if I "knew his Name" I could 
   pass by --- "i.e.", next time I climb up to the Threshold of the Pylon.<br>
   I think the entries 1.25 and 3.35 A.M. explain it. "HUGGING MYSELF, AS 
   IT WERE." How fatally {92} accurate! I wrote it and never saw the hellish 
   snare! I ought to have risen up and prepared myself ceremonially as a bride, 
   and waited in the proper magical manner. Also I was too pleased with the Heralds 
   of my Lord's coming --- the vision of Khephra, etc. It was perhaps this subtle 
   self-satisfaction that lost me ... so I fell to the shocking abyss of last night!<br>
   The Dweller of the Threshold is never visible until after one has fallen; he 
   is a Veiled God and smites like the Evil Knight in Malory, riding and slaying 
   --- and no man seeth him. But when you are tumbled headlong into Hell, where 
   he lives, then he unveils his Face, and blasts you with its horror!<br>
   Very good, John St. John, now you know! You are plain John St. John and you 
   have to climb right up again through the paths to the Threshold; and remember 
   this time to mortify that self- satisfaction! Go at it more reverently and humbly 
   --- oh, you dog, how I loathe you for your Vileness! To have risen so high, 
   and --- now --- to be thus fallen! 
 </p><p> 4.40. The question arises: how to mortify this self-satisfaction?<br>
   Asceticism notoriously fosters egoism; how good am I to go without dinner! Now 
   noble! What renunciation!<br>
   On the other hand,the good wine in one says: "A fine fellow I have made 
   my coffin of!"<br>
   The answer is simple, the old answer: "think not of" {93} "St. 
   John" "and his foolishness; think of Adonai!" Exactly: the one 
   difficulty!<br>
   My best way out will be to concentrate on the New Ritual, learn it perfectly 
   by heart, work it at the right moment. ...<br>
   I will go, with this idea, to have a Citron press; thence to my Secret 
   Restaurant, and dine, always learning the Ritual.<br>
   I will leave off the mantra, though it is nearly as much part of me as my head 
   by now; and instead repeat over and over again the words of the Ritual so that 
   I can do it in the end with perfect fluency and comprehension. And this time 
   may Adonai build the House! 
 </p><p> 6.10. Instead I met Dr. R---, who kindly offered to teach me how to obtain 
   astral visions! (P.S. --- The tone of this entry wrongs me. I sat patiently 
   and reverently, like a "chela" with his "guru," hoping to 
   hear the Word I needed.) Thence I went my long and lonely walk to my Secret 
   Restaurant, learning the Ritual as I went. 
 </p><p> 7.15. Arrived at the Secret Restaurant. Ordered 6 ousters, Rable de Livre 
   poivrade pure de marrons, and Glace "Casserole" with a small 
   bottle of Perrier Water.<br>
   I know the New Ritual down to the end of the Confession. It was hard to stop 
   the mantra --- the moment my thought wandered, up it popped! 
 </p><p> 8.3. I shall add Caf Cognac Cigare to this debauch.<br>
   I continue learning the Ritual. 
 </p><p> 8.40. I will return and humble myself before the Lord {94} Adonai. It is near 
   the night of the Full Moon; in my life the Full Moon hath ever been of great 
   augury. But to-night I am too poor in spirit to hope.<br>
   Lo! I was travelling on the paths of Lamed and of Mem, of Justice and the Hanged 
   Man, and I fell into both the pitfalls thereof. Instead of the Great Balance 
   firmly held, I found only Libra, the house of Venus and of the exaltation of 
   Saturn; and these evil planets, smiling and frowning, overcame me. And so for 
   the sublime Path of Man; instead of that symbol of the Adept, his foot set firmly 
   upon heaven, his whole figure showing forth the Reconciler with the Invisible, 
   I found but the stagnant and bitter water of selfishness, the Dead Sea of the 
   Soul. For all is Illusion. Who saith "I" denieth Adonai, save only 
   if he mean Adonai. And Daleth the Door of the Pylon, is that Tree whereon the 
   Adept of Man hangeth, and Daleth is Love Supernal, that if it be inserted in 
   the word ANI, "I," giveth ADNI, Adonai.<br>
   Subtle art thou and deadly, O Dweller of the Threshold (P.S. --- This name is 
   a bad one. "Dweller beside the Pylon" is a better term; for he is 
   not in the straight path, which is simple and easy and open. He is never "overcome"; 
   to meet him is the proof of having strayed. The Key fits the Door perfectly; 
   but he who is drunken on the bad wine of Sense and Thought fumbles thereat.<br>
   And of course there is a great deal of door, and very little key- hole), who 
   dost use my very love of Adonai to destroy me!<br>
   Yet how shall I approach Him, if not with reverent {95} joy, with a delicious 
   awe? I must wash His feet with my tears; I must die at His gateway; I must ... 
   I know not what ...<br>
   Adonai, be thou tender unto me Thy slave, and keep my footsteps in the Way of 
   Truth! ... I will return and humble myself before the Lord Adonai. 
 </p><p> 10.18. Home again; have done odd necessary things, and am ready to work.<br>
   I feel slack; and I feel that I have been slack, though probably the Record 
   shows a fair amount of work done. But I am terribly bruised by the Great Fall; 
   these big things leave the body and mind no worse, apparently; but they hurt 
   the Self, and later that is reflected into the lower parts of the man as insanity 
   or death.<br>
   I must attain, or ... an end of John St. John.<br>
   An end of him, one way or the other, then!<br>
   Good-bye, John! 
 </p><p> 10.30. Ten minutes wasted in sheer mooning! I'm getting worse every minute. 
 </p><p> 10.40. Fooled away ten minutes more! 
 </p><p> 10.57. Humiliation enough! For though I made the cross with Blood and Flame, 
   I cannot even remain concentrated in humiliation, which yet I feel so acutely. 
   What a wormy worm I am! I tried the new strict Siddhasana, only to find that 
   I had hurt myself so this morning with it that I cannot bear it at all, even 
   with the pillow to support the instep.<br>
   I will just try and do a little Pranayama, to see if I can {96} stay doing any 
   one simple thing for ten minutes at a stretch! 
 </p><p> 11.30. Twenty-five Breath-Cycles ... But it nearly killed me. I was saying 
   over the Ritual, and did so want to get to the Formulation of the Hexagram at 
   least, if not to the Reception. As it was, I broke down during the Passage of 
   the Pylons, luckily not till I had reached that of Tahuti.<br>
   But it is a good rule; when in doubt play Pranayama. For one can no longer worry 
   about the Path: the Question is reduced to the simple problem: Am, I, or am 
   I not, going to burst?<br>
   I got all the sweating and trembling of the body that heart could desire; but 
   no "jumping about like a frog" or levitation. A pity! 
 </p><p> 11.45. I shall read for a little in the Yoga-Shastra as a rest. Then for the 
   end of the day and the Beginning of the Ninth Day. Zoroaster (or Pythagoras?) 
   informs us that the number Nine is sacred, and attains the summit of Philosophy. 
   I'm sure I hope so! 
 </p><p> 11.56. I get into Asana ... and so endeth the Eighth Lesson. 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"><em> The Ninth Day</em></h3>
 <p> 12.2. Thus I began this great day, being in my Asana firm and easy, and holding 
   in my breath for a full minute while I threw my will with all my might towards 
   Adonai. 
 </p><p> 12.19. Have settled myself for the night. Will continue a little, learning 
   the Ritual. {97} 
 </p><p> 12.37. Having learnt a few passages of a suitable nature to go to sleep upon, 
   I will do so.<br>
   ... Now I hope that I shall; surely the Reaction of Nature against the Magical 
   Will must be wearing down at last! 
 </p><p> 2.12. I wake. It takes me a little while to shake off the dominion of sleep, 
   very intense and bitter. 
 </p><p> 3.4. Thus John St. John --- for it is not convenient further to speak as "I" 
   --- performed 45 Breath-cycles; for 20 minutes he had to struggle against the 
   Root of the Powers of Sleep, and the obstruction of his left nostril.<br>
   During his Kambhakham he willed Adonai with all his might. Let him sleep, invoking 
   Adonai! 
 </p><p> 5.40. Well hath he slept, and well awakened.<br>
   The last entry should extend to 3.30 or thereabouts; probably later; for, invoking 
   Adonai, he again got the beginnings of the Light, and the "telephone-cross" 
   voices very strongly. But this time he was fortunately able to concentrate on 
   Adonai with some fervour, and these things ceased to trouble. But the Perfume 
   and the Vision came not, nor any full manifestation of the L.V.X., the Secret 
   Light, the light that shineth in darkness.<br>
   John St. John is again very sleepy. He will try and concentrate on Adonai without 
   doing Pranayama --- much harder of course. It is a supreme effort to keep both 
   eyes open together. {98}<br>
   He must do his best. He does not wish to wake too thoroughly, either, lest afterward 
   he oversleep himself, and miss his appointment with Michael Brenner to continue 
   moulding Siddhasana. 
 </p><p> 7.45. Again I awake. ... [O swine! thou hast felt in thyself "Good! Good! 
   the night is broken up nicely; all goes very well" --- and thou hast written 
   "I!" O swine, John St. John! When wilt thou learn that the least stirring 
   of thy smug content is the great Fall from the Path?]<br>
   It will be best to get up and do some kind of work; for the beast would sleep. 
 </p><p> 8.25. John St. John has arisen, after doing 20 breath-cycles, reciting internally 
   the ritual, 70 per cent. of which he now knows by heart. 
 </p><p> 8.35. To the Dme --- a caf-croissant. Some proofs to correct during 
   the meal. 
 </p><p> 10.25. Having walked over to the studio reciting the Ritual (9.25-9.55 approximately), 
   John St. John got into his pose, and began going for the gloves. The Interior 
   Trembling began, and the room filled with the Subtle Light. He was within an 
   ace of Concentration; the Violet Lotus of Ajna appeared, flashing like some 
   marvellous comet; the Dawn began to break, as he slew with the Lightning-Flash 
   every thought that arose in him, especially this Vision of Ajna; but fear --- 
   dread fear! --- gripped his heart. Annihilation stood before him, annihilation 
   of John St. John that he had {99} so long striven to obtain: yet he dared not. 
   He had the loaded pistol to his head; he could not pull the trigger. This must 
   have gone on for some time; his agony of failure was awful; for he knew that 
   he was failing; but though he cried a thousand times unto Adonai with the Voice 
   of Death, he could not --- he could not. Again and again he stood at the gate, 
   and could not enter. And the Violet Flames of Ajna triumphed over him.<br>
   Then Brenner said: "Let us take a little rest!" --- oh irony! --- 
   and he came down from his throne, staggering with fatigue. ...<br>
   If you can conceive all his anger and despair! His pen, writing this, forms 
   a letter badly, and through clenched teeth he utters a fierce curse.<br>
   Oh Lord Adonai, look with favour upon him! 
 </p><p> 11.30. After five minutes rest (to the body, that is), John St. John was too 
   exhausted on resuming his pose, which, by the way, happens to be the Sign of 
   the Grade 7ø = 4ø, to strive consciously. But his nature itself, forced through 
   these days into the one channel of Will towards Adonai, went on struggling on 
   its own account. Later, the conscious man took heart and strove, though not 
   so fiercely as before. He passed through the Lightnings of Ajna, whose two petals 
   now spread out like wings above his head, and the awful Corona of the Interior 
   Sun with its flashing fires appeared, and declared itself to be his Self. This 
   he rejected; and the Formless Ocean of {100} White Brilliance absorbed him, 
   overcame him; for he could not pass therethrough. This went on repeating itself, 
   the man transformed (as it were) into a mighty Battering Ram hurling itself 
   again and again against the Walls of the City of God to breach them. --- And 
   as yet he has failed. Failed. Failed. Physical and mental exhaustion are fairly 
   complete.<br>
   Adonai, look with favour upon Thy slave! 
 </p><p> 12.20. He has walked, reciting the Ritual, to Dr. R--- and H--- for lunch. 
   They have forgotten the appointment, so he continues and reaches Lavenue's at 
   12.4 after reading his letters and doing one or two necessary things. He orders 
   Epinards, Tarte aux Fraises, Glace au Caf, and 1/2 Evian. The distaste 
   for food is great; and for meat amounts to loathing. The weather is exceedingly 
   hot; it may be arranged thus by Adonai to enable John St. John to meditate in 
   comfort. For he is vowed solemnly "to interpret every phenomenon as a particular 
   dealing of God with his soul." 
 </p><p> 12.50. During lunch he will go on correcting his proofs. 
 </p><p> 1.35. Lunch over, and the proofs read through. 
 </p><p> 1.45. He will make a few decorations further in his Ritual, and perhaps design 
   the Fontispiece and Colophon. He is very weary, and may sleep. 
 </p><p> 2.25. He has done the illumination, as far as may be. He will now lie down 
   as Hanged Man, and invoke Adonai. {101} 
 </p><p> 4.45. He was too tired to reach nearer than the neighbourhood of that tremendous 
   Threshold; wherefore he fell from meditation into sleep, and there his Lord 
   gave him sweet rest thereof.<br>
   He will arise, and take a drink --- a citron press --- at the Dme; 
   for the day is yet exceeding hot, and he has had little. 
 </p><p> 4.53. One ought to remark that all this sleep is full extravagant dreams; 
   rarely irrational and never (of course) unpleasant, or one would be up and working 
   with a circle every night. But O.M. thinks that they show an excited and unbalanced 
   condition of John St. John's brain, though he is almost too cowed to express 
   an opinion at all, even were the question, Is grass green?<br>
   Every small snatch of sleep, without exception, in the last three or four days, 
   has these images.<br>
   The ideal condition seems likely to be perfect oblivion --- or (in the Adept) 
   is the Tamo-Guna, the Power of elemental Darkness, broken once and for ever, 
   so that His sleep is vivid and rational as another man's waking; His waking 
   another man's Samadhi; His Samadhi --- to which He ever strives ---- ?????<br>
   At least this later view is suggested by the Rosicrucian formula of Reception:<br>
 </p><blockquote> May thy mind be open unto the Higher!<br>
   May thy heart be the Centre of Light!<br>
   May thy body be the Temple of the Rosy Cross!</blockquote>
 and by the Hindu statement that in the attained Yogin {102} the Kundalini sleeps 
 in the Svadistthana, no more in the Muladhara Cakkram.<br>
 See also the Rosicrucian lecture on the Microcosmos, where this view is certainly 
 upheld, the Qliphoth of an Adept being balanced and trained to fill his Malkuth, 
 vacated by the purified Nephesch which has gone up to live in Tiphereth.<br>
 Or so O.M. read it.<br>
 The other idea of the Light descending and filling each principle with its glory 
 is, it seems to him, less fertile, and less in accord with any idea of Evolution.<br>
 (What would Judas McCabbage think?)<br>
 And one can so readily understand how tremendous a task is that of the postulant, 
 since he has to glorify and initiate all his principles and train them to their 
 new and superior tasks. This surely explains better the terrible dangers of the 
 path. ...<br>
 Some years back, on the Red River in China, John St. John saw at every corner 
 of that swift and dangerous stream a heap of wreckage.<br>
 ... He, himself in danger, thought of his magical career.<br>
 Alcoholism, insanity, disease, faddism, death, knavery, prison --- every earthly 
 hell, reflection of some spiritual blunder, had seized his companions. By dozens 
 had that band been swept away, dashed to pieces on one rock or another. He, alone 
 almost upon that angry stream, still held on, his life each moment the plaything 
 of giant forces, so enormous as to be (once they were loose) quite out of proportion 
 to all human wit or courage or address --- and he held on his course, humbly, 
 {103} not hopelessly, not fearfully, but with an abiding certainty that he would 
 endure unto the end.<br>
 And now?<br>
 In this great Magical Retirement he has struck many rocks, sprung many leaks; 
 the waters of the False Sea foam over the bow, ride and carry the quarter --- 
 is he perchance already wrecked, his hopeless plight concealed from him as yet 
 by his own darkness?<br>
 For, dazzled as he is by the blinding brilliance of this morning's Spiritual Sun, 
 which yet he beheld but darkly, to him now even the light of earth seems dark. 
 Reason the rudder was long since unshipped; the power of his personality has broken 
 down, yet under the tiny storm-sail of his Will to Adonai, the crazy bark holds 
 way, steered by the oar of Discipline --- Yea, he holds his course. Adonai! Adonai! 
 is not the harbour yet in sight? 
 <p> 6.7. He has returned home and burnt (as every night since its arrival) the 
   holy incense of Abramelin the Mage.<br>
   The atmosphere is full of vitality, sweetened and strengthened; the soul naturally 
   and simply turns to the holy task with vigour and confidence; the black demons 
   of doubt and despair flee away; one respires already a foretaste of the Perfume, 
   and obtains almost a premonition of the Vision.<br>
   So, let the work go on. 
 </p><p> 6.23. 7 Breath-cycles, rather difficult. Clothes are a nuisance, and make 
   all the difference. 
 </p><p> 6.31. John St. John is more broken up by this morning's {104} failure than 
   he was ready to admit. But the fact stands; he cannot concentrate his mind for 
   three seconds together. How utterly hopeless it makes one feel! One thinks one 
   is at least always good for a fair average performance --- and one is undeceived. 
   This, by the way, is the supreme use of a record like this. It makes it impossible 
   to cheat oneself.<br>
   Well, he has got to get up more steam somehow, though the boiler bursts. Perhaps 
   early dinner, with Ritual, may induce that Enthusiastic Energy of which the 
   Gnostics write.<br>
   This morning the whole Sankhara-dhatu (the tendency of the being John St. John) 
   was operating aright. Now by no effort of will can he flog his tired cattle 
   along the trail.<br>
   So poor a thing is he that he will even seek an Oracle from the book of Zoroaster.<br>
   Done. Zoroaster respectfully wishes to point out that "The most mystic 
   of discourses informs us --- his wholeness is in the Supra-Mundane Order; for 
   there a Solar World and Boundless light subsist, as the Oracles of the Chaldeans 
   affirm."<br>
   Not very helpful, is it?<br>
   As if divination could ever help on such exalted planes! As if the trumpery 
   elementals that operate these things possessed the Secrets of the Destiny of 
   an Adept, or could help him in his agony!<br>
   For this reason, divination should be discarded from the start: it is only a 
   "mere toy, the basis of mercenary fraud" as Zoroaster more practically 
   assures us. {105}<br>
   Yet one can get the right stuff out of the Tarot (or other inconvenient method) 
   by spiritualising away all the meaning, until the intuition pierces that blank 
   wall of ignorance.<br>
   Let O.M. meditate upon this Oracle on his way to feed John St. John's body --- 
   and thus feed his own! 
 </p><p> 6.52. Out, out, to feed! 
 </p><p> 6.57. Trimming his beard in preparation for going out, he reflects that the 
   deplorable tone (as one's Dean would say) of the last entry is not the cry of 
   the famished beast, but that of the over-driven slave.<br>
   "Adonai, ply Thou thy scourge! Adonai, load Thou the chain!" 
 </p><p> 7.25. What the devil is the matter with the time? The hours flit just like 
   butterflies --- the moon, dead full, shines down the Boulevard. My moon --- 
   full moon of my desire! (Ha, ha, thou beast! are "I and Me and Mine" 
   not dead yet?)<br>
   Yea, Lord Adonai! but the full moon means much to John St. John; he fears ("fears," 
   O Lord of the Western Pylon!) lest, of once that full moon pass, he may not 
   win through. ...<br>
   "The harvest is over, the summer is ended, and we are not saved!" 
   Yet hath not Abramelin lashed the folly of limiting the spiritual paths by the 
   motions of the planets? And Zoroaster, in that same oracle just quoted? 
 </p><p> 7.35. Hors d'OEuvres, Bouillabaisse, contrefilet rti, Glace. 1/2 Graves. 
   {106}<br>
   The truth is that the Chittam is excited and racing, the control being impaired; 
   and the Ego is springing up again. 
 </p><p> 7.50. This racing of the Chittam is simply shocking. John St. John must stop 
   it somehow. Hours and hours seem to have passed since the last entry. 
 </p><p> 7.57. !!! He is in such a deuce of a hurry that (in a lucid moment) he finds 
   himself trying to eat bread, radish, beef and potato at a mouthful.<br>
   Worse, the beast is pleased and excited at the novelty of the sensation, and 
   takes delight in recording it.<br>
   Beast! Beast! 
 </p><p> 8.3. !!!! After myriads of aeons. He has drunk only about one third of his 
   half-bottle of light white wine; yet he's like a hashish- drunkard, only more 
   so. The loss of the time-sense which occurs with hashish he got during his experiments 
   with that drug in 1906, but in an unimportant way. (Damn him! he is so glad. 
   He calls this a Result. A result! Damn him!) O.M. who writes this is so angry 
   with him that he wants to scrawl the page over with the most fearful curses! 
   and John St. John has nearly thrown a bottle at the waiter for not bringing 
   the next course. He will not be allowed to finish his wine! He orders cold water. 
 </p><p> 8.12. Things a little better. But he tries 100 small muscular movements, pressing 
   on the table with his fingers in tune, and finds the tendency to hurry almost 
   irresistible. This record is here written at lightning speed. ... Attempt to 
   write slowly is painful. {107} 
 </p><p> 8.20. The thought too, is wandering all over the world. Since the last entry, 
   very likely, the beast has not thought even once of Adonai. 
 </p><p> 8.35. The Reading of the Ritual has done much service, though things are still 
   far from calm. Yet the mighty flood of the Chittam is again rolling its tremendous 
   tide toward the sea --- the Sea of annihilation. Amen. 
 </p><p> 9.0. Returning home, with his eyes fixed on the supreme glory of the Moon, 
   in his heart and brain invoking Adonai, he hath now entered into his little 
   chamber, and will prepare all things for the due performance of the New Ritual 
   which he hath got by heart. 
 </p><p> 9.35. Nearly ready. In a state of very intense magical strain --- anything 
   might happen. 
 </p><p> 9.48. Washed, robed, temple in order. Will wait until 10 o'clock and begin 
   upon the stroke. O.M. 7ø = 4ø will begin; and then solemnly renounce all his 
   robes, weapons, dignities, etc., renouncing his grades even by giving the Signs 
   of them backwards and downwards toward the outer. He will keep only one thing, 
   the Secret Ring that hath been committed unto him by the Masters; for from that 
   he cannot part, even if he would. That is his Password into the Ritual itself; 
   and on his finger it shall be put at the moment when all else is gone. 
 </p><p> 11.5. Ceremony works admirably. Magical Images strong. At Reception behold! 
   the Sigil of the Supreme Order itself in a blaze of glory not to be spoken of. 
   And the half-seen symbol of my Lord Adonai therewith as a mighty angel glittering 
   with infinite light. {108} According the the Ritual, O.M. withdrew himself from 
   the Vision; the Vision of the Universe, a whirling abyss of coruscating suns 
   in all the colours, yet informed and dominated by that supernal brilliance. 
   Yet O. M. refused the Vision; and a conflict began and was waged through many 
   ages --- so it seemed. And now all the enemies of O. M. banded themselves against 
   him. The petty affairs of the day; even the irritations of his body, the emotions 
   of him, the plans of him, worry about the Record and the Ritual and --- O! everything! 
   --- then, too, the thoughts which are closer yet to the great Enemy, the sense 
   of separateness; that sense itself at last --- so O. M. withdrew from the conflict 
   for a moment so that the duty of this Record done might leave him free for the 
   fight.<br>
   It may have been a snare --- may the Lord Adonai keep him in the Path.<br>
   Adonai! Adonai!<br>
   (P.S. --- Add that the "ultra-violet" or "astral" light 
   in the room was such that it seemed bright as daylight. He hath never seen the 
   like, even in the ceremony which he performed in the Great Pyramid of Gizeh.) 
 </p><p> 11.14- O. M. then passed from vision unto vision of unexampled <br>
   11.34. splendour. The infinite abyss of space, a rayless orb of liquid and colourless 
   brilliance fading beyond the edges into a flame of white and gold. ... The Rosy 
   Cross flashing with lustre ineffable. ... and more, much more which ten scribes 
   could hardly catalogue in a century. {109}<br>
   The Vision of the Holy Guardian Angel itself; yet was He seen as from afar, 
   not intimately. ...<br>
   Therefore is O. M. not content with all this wonder; but will now orderly close 
   the temple, that at the Beginning of the Tenth Day --- and Ten are the Holy 
   Sephiroth, the Emanations of the Crown; Blessed be He! ... He may make new considerations 
   of this Operation whereby he may discover through what error he is thus betrayed 
   again and again into failure. Failure. Failure. 
 </p><p> 11.49. The Temple is closed.<br>
   Now the, O Lord Adonai! Let the Tenth Day be favourable unto O. M. For in the 
   struggle he is as nothing worth. Nor valiant, nor fortunate, nor skilful --- 
   except Thou fight by his side, cover his breast with Thy shield, second his 
   blows with Thy spear and with Thy sword.<br>
   Aye! let the Ninth Day close in silence and in darkness, and let O.M. be found 
   watching and waiting and willing Thy Presence. Adonai! Adonai! O Lord Adonai! 
   Let Thy Light illumine the Path of that darkling wight John St. John, that being 
   who, separate from Thee, is separate from all<br>
   Light, Life, Love.<br>
   Adonai! Adonai! let it be written of O. M. that "The Lord Adonai is about 
   him like a thunderbolt and like a Pylon and like a Serpent and like a Phallus 
   --- and in the midst thereof like the Woman that jetteth the Milk {110} of the 
   Stars from Her paps; yea, the Milk of the Stars from Her paps." 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"> <em> The Tenth Day</em></h3>
 <p> 12.17. Now that the perfume of the incense is clearly away, one may most potently 
   perceive the Invoked Perfume of the Ceremony Itself. And this mystical perfume 
   of Adonai is like pure Musk, but infinitely subtilised --- far stronger, and 
   at the same time far more delicate.<br>
   (P.S. --- Doubt has arisen about this perfume, as to whether there was not a 
   commonplace cause. On the balance of the evidence, carefully considered, one 
   would pronounce for the mystic theory.)<br>
   One should add a curious omen. On sitting down for the great struggle (11.14) 
   John St. John found a nail upon the floor, at his feet. Now a nail is Vau in 
   Hebrew, and the Tarot Trump corresponding to Vau is the Hierophant or Initiator 
   --- whereby is O. M. greatly comforted.<br>
   So poor a thing hath he become!<br>
   Even as a little child groping feebly for the breast of its mother, so gropeth 
   Thy little child after Thee, O thou Self- Glittering One! 
 </p><p> 12.55. He hath read through Days VIII. and IX.<br>
   ... He is too tired to understand what he reads. He will, despite of all, do 
   a little Pranayama, and then sleep, ever willing Adonai.<br>
   For Pranayama with its intense physical strain is a great medicine for the mind. 
   Even as the long trail of the desert and the life with the winds and the stars, 
   {111} the daily march and its strife with heat, thirst, fatigue, cure all the 
   ills of the soul, so does Pranayama clear away the phantoms that Mayan, dread 
   maker of Illusion, hath cumbered it withal. 
 </p><p> 1.13. 10 Breath-Cycles; calm, perfect, without the least effort; enough to 
   go to sleep upon.<br>
   He will read through the Ritual once, and then sleep. (The Pranayama precipitated 
   a short attack of diarrhoea, started by the chill of the Ceremony.) 
 </p><p> 6.23. He slept from 1.45 (approximately) till now. The morn is cold and damp; 
   rain has fallen.<br>
   John St. John is horribly tired; the "control" is worn to a thread. 
   He takes five minutes to make up his mind to go through with it, five more to 
   wash and write this up. And he has a million excuses for not doing Pranayama. 
 </p><p> 6.51. 15 Breath-cycles, steady and easy enough.<br>
   The brain is cool and lucid; but no energy is in it. At least no Sammav yamo. 
   And at present the Superscription on John St. John's Cross is<br>
 </p><blockquote> FAILURE.</blockquote>
 <br>
 Marvellous and manifold as are his results, he hath renounced them and esteemeth 
 them as dross. ... This is right, John St. John! yet how is it that there is place 
 for the great hunchbacked devil to whisper in thine ear the doubt: Is there in 
 truth any mystic path at all? Is it all disappointment and illusion?<br>
 And the "Poor Thing" John St. John moves off {112} shivering and sad, 
 like a sot who has tried to get credit at a tavern and is turned away --- and 
 that on Christmas Eve!<br>
 There is no money in his purse, no steam in his boilers --- that's what's the 
 matter with John St. John. It is clear enough, what happened yesterday. He failed 
 at the four Pylons in turn; in the morning Fear stopped him at that of Horus and 
 so on; while in the evening he either failed at the Pylon of Thoth, "i.e.", 
 was obsessed by the necessity (alleged) of recording his results, or failed to 
 overcome the duality of Thoth. Otherwise, even if he comprehended the base, he 
 certainly failed at the apex of the Pyramid.<br>
 In any case, he cannot blame the Ceremony, which is most potent; one or two small 
 details may need correction, but no more.<br>
 Here then he is down at the bottom of the hill again, a Rosicrucian Sisyphus with 
 the Stone of the Philosophers! An Ixion bound to the Wheel of Destiny and of the 
 Samsara, unable to reach the centre, where is Rest.<br>
 He must add to the entry 1.13 that the "telephone-cross" voices came 
 as he composed himself to sleep, in the Will to Adonai.<br>
 This time he detached a body of cavalry to chase them to oblivion. Perhaps an 
 unwise division of his forces; yet he was so justly indignant at the eternal illusions 
 that he may be excused.<br>
 Excused! To whom? Thou must succeed or fail! O Batsman, with thy frail fortress 
 of Three-in-One, the Umpire cries "Out"; and thou explainest to thy 
 friends {113} in the pavilion. But thy friends have heard that story before, and 
 thy explanation will not appear in the score. "Mr. J. St. John, b. Maya," 
 0, they will read in the local newspaper. There is no getting away from that!<br>
 Failure! Failure! Failure!<br>
 Now then let me (7.35) take the position of the Hanged Man and invoke Adonai. 
 <p> 9.0. Probably sleep returned shortly. Not a good night, through dreamless, 
   so far as memory serves.<br>
   The rain comes wearily down, not chasing the dryness, but soddening the streets.<br>
   The rain of autumn, not the rain of spring!<br>
   So is it in this soul, Lord Adonai. The thought of Thee is heavy and uneasy, 
   flabby and loose, like an old fat woman stupid-drunk in her slum; which was 
   as a young maiden in a field of lilies, arrow-straight, sun-strong, moon-pure, 
   a form all litheness and eagerness, dancing, dancing for her own excess of life.<br>
   Adonai! Adonai! 
 </p><p> 9.17. Rose, dressed, etc., reflecting on the Path. Blinder than ever!<br>
   The brain is in revolt; it has been compressed too long. Yet it is impossible 
   to rest. It is too late. The Irresistible God, whose name is Destiny, has been 
   invoked, and He hath answered. The matter is in His hands; He must end it, either 
   with that mighty spiritual Experience which I have sought, or else with black 
   madness, or with death. By the Body of God, swear thou that death would come 
   --- welcome, welcome, welcome! {114} And to Thee, and from Thee, O thou great 
   god Destiny, there is no appeal. Thou turnest not one hair's breadth from Thy 
   path appointed.<br>
   That which "John St. John" "means" (else is it a blank name) 
   is that which he must be --- and what is that? The issue is with Thee --- cannot 
   one wait with fortitude, whether it be for the King's Banqueting-House or for 
   the Headsman and the Block? 
 </p><p> 9.45. Breakfast --- croissant, sandwich, 2 coffees. Concentrating "off" 
   the Work as well as possible. 
 </p><p> 10.10. Arrived at Brenner's studio. The rest has produced one luminous idea: 
   why not end it all with destruction? Say a great ritual of Geburah, curses, 
   curses, curses! John St. John ought not to have forgotten how to curse. In his 
   early days at Wastdale Head people would travel miles to hear him!<br>
   Curse all the Gods and all the demons --- all those things in short which go 
   to make up John St. John. For "that" --- as he now knows --- is the 
   Name of the great Enemy, the Dweller upon the Threshold. It was that mighty 
   spirit whose formless horror beat him back, for it was he!<br>
   So now to return to concentration and the Will toward Adonai. 
 </p><p> 10.20. One thing is well; the vow of "interpreting every phenomenon as 
   a particular dealing of God with my soul" is keeping itself.<br>
   Whatever impression reaches the consciousness is turned by it into a symbol 
   or a simile of the Work. {115} 
 </p><p> 11.18. The pose over; recited Ritual, now known by heart; then willed Adonai; 
   hopelessly unconcentrated.<br>
   ... To interpret this Record aright, it must, however, be understood that the 
   "Standard of Living" goes up at an incredible rate. The same achievement 
   would, say five days ago, have been entered as "High degree of concentration; 
   unhoped-for success."<br>
   The phenomena which to-day one dismisses with annoyed contempt are the same 
   which John St. John worked four years continuously to attain, and when attained 
   seemed almost to outstrip the possible of glory. The flood of the Chittam is 
   again being heaped up by the dam of Discipline. There is less headache, and 
   more sense of being on the Path --- that is the only way one finds of expressing 
   it. 
 </p><p> 11.45. Worse and worse; though pose even better held.<br>
   In despair returned to a simple practice, the holding of the mind to a single 
   imagined object; in this case the Triangle surmounted by the Cross. It seems 
   quite easy to do nowadays; why shouldn't it lead to the Result? It used to be 
   supposed to do so.<br>
   Might be worth trying anyway; things can hardly be worse than they are.<br>
   Or, one might go over to the Hammam, and have a long bath and sleep --- but 
   who can tell whether it would refresh, or merely destroy the whole edifice built 
   up so laboriously in these ten days? 
 </p><p> 12.15. At Panthon. 1/2 dozen Marennes, Rognons Brochette, Lait chaud.<br>
   {116}<br>
   John St. John is aching all over, cannot get comfortable anyhow; is hungry, 
   and has no appetite; thirsty, and loathes the thought of drinking!<br>
   He must do something --- something pretty drastic, or he will find himself in 
   serious trouble of body and mind, the shadows of his soul, that is sick unto 
   death. For "where are now their gods?" Where is the Lord, the Lord 
   Adonai? 
 </p><p> 12.35. The beast feels decidedly better; but whether he is more concentrated 
   one may doubt. Honestly, he is now so blind that he cannot tell!<br>
   Perhaps a "caf, cognac, et cigare" may tune him up to the point 
   of either going back to work, or across Paris to the Hammam. He will make the 
   experiment, reading through his proofs the while.<br>
   One good thing; the Chittam is moving slowly. The waiters all hurry him --- 
   what a contrast to last night! 
 </p><p> 1.15. Proofs read through again. John St. John feels far from well. 
 </p><p> 2.15. A stroll down the Boul' Mich' and a visit to M---'s studio improve matters 
   a good deal. 
 </p><p> 3.30. The cure continued. No worry about the Work, but an effort to put it 
   altogether out of the mind.<br>
   A caf crme, forty minutes at the Academie Marcelle --- a gruelling 
   bout without gloves --- and J. St. J. is at the Luxembourg to look at the pretty 
   pictures. 
 </p><p> 3.40. The proof of the pudding, observes the most mystic of discourses (surely!), 
   is in the Eating. {117}<br>
   One might justly object to any Results of this Ten days' strain. But if abundant 
   health and new capacity to do great work be the after-effect, who then will 
   dare to cast a stone?<br>
   Not that it matters a turnip-top to the Adept himself. But others may be deterred 
   from entering the Path by the foolish talk of the ignorant, and thus may flowers 
   be lost that should go to make the fadeless wreath of Adonai. Ah, Lord, pluck 
   "me" up utterly by the root, and set that which Thou pluckest as a 
   flower upon thy brow! 
 </p><p> 4.10. Walked back to the Dme to drink a citron press through the 
   lovely gardens, sad with their fallen leaves. Reflecting on what Dr. Henry Maudsley 
   once wrote to him about mysticism "Like other bad habits (he might have 
   said 'Like all living beings') it grows by what it fees on." Most important, 
   then, to use the constant critical check on all one's work. The devotion to 
   Adonai might itself fall under suspicion, where it not for the definition of 
   Adonai.<br>
   Adonai is that thought which informs and strengthens and purifies, supreme sanity 
   in supreme genius. Anything that is not that is not Adonai.<br>
   Hence the refusal of all other Results, however glorious; for they are all relative, 
   partial, impure. Anicca, Dukkha, Anatta: Change, sorrow, Unsubstantiality; these 
   are their characteristics, however much they may appear to be Atman, Sat, Chit, 
   Ananda, Soul, Being, Knowledge, Bliss.<br>
   But the main consideration was one of expediency. {118} Has not John St. John 
   possibly been stuffing himself both with Methods and Results?<br>
   Certainly this morning was more like the engorgement of the stomach with too 
   much food than like the headache after a bout of drunkenness.<br>
   A less grave fault, by far; it is easy and absurd to get a kind of hysterical 
   ecstasy over religion, love, or wine. A German will take off his hat and dance 
   and jodel to the sunrise --- and nothing comes of it! Darwin studies Nature 
   with more reverence and enthusiasm, but without antics --- and out comes the 
   Law of Evolution. So it is written "By their fruits ye shall know them." 
   But about this question of spiritual overfeeding --- what did Darwin do when 
   he got to the stage (as he did, be sure! many a time) when he wished every pigeon 
   in the world at the devil! Now this wish has never really arisen in John St. 
   John; however bad he feels, he always feels that Attainment is the only possible 
   way out of it. This is the good Karma of his ten years' constant striving.<br>
   Well, in the upshot, he will get back to Work at once, and hope that his few 
   hours in the world may prove a true strategic movement to the rear, and not 
   a euphemism for rout! 
 </p><p> 5.4. There are further serious considerations to be made concerning Adonai. 
   This title for the Unknown Thought was adopted by O. M. in November, 19--, in 
   Upper Burma, on the occasion of his passing through the ordeal and receiving 
   the grade which should be really attributed to Daath (on account of its nature, 
   the {119} Mastery of the Reason), though it is commonly called 7ø = 4ø. It appeared 
   to him at that period that so much talk and time were wasted on discussing the 
   nature of the Attainment --- a discussion foredoomed to failure, in the absence 
   of all Knowledge, and in view of the Self-Contradictory Nature of the Reasoning 
   Faculty, as applied to Metaphysics --- that it would be wiser to drop the whole 
   question, and concentrate on a simple Magical Progress.<br>
   The Next Step for humanity in general was then "the Knowledge and Conversation 
   of the Holy Guardian Angel."<br>
   One thing at a time.<br>
   But here he finds himself discussing and disputing with himself the nature of 
   that Knowledge.<br>
   Better far act as hitherto, and aspire simply and directly, as one person to 
   another, careless of the critical objections (quite insuperable, of course) 
   to this or any other conception.<br>
   For as this experience transcends reason, it is fruitless to argue about it.<br>
   Adonai, I invoke Thee!<br>
   Simpler, then, to go back to the Egoistic diction, only remembering always that 
   by "I" is meant John St. John, or O. M., or Adonai according to the 
   context. 
 </p><p> 5.30. Having read some of THE Books to induct myself again into the Work.<br>
   Therefore will I kindle the holy Incense, and turn myself again to the One Thought. 
   {120} 
 </p><p> 6.27. All this time in Hanged Man position, and thinking of everything else.<br>
   As bad as it was on the very first day! 
 </p><p> 7.10. More waste time aimlessly watching a poker game. Walked down to Caf 
   de Versailles. Dinner. Hors d'OEuvre, Escargots, Cassoulet de Castelnaudry, 
   Glace, 1/2 Evian. Am quite washed-out. I have not even the courage of despair. 
   There is not enough left in me to despair.<br>
   I don't care. 
 </p><p> 7.35. One gleam of light illumines the dark path --- I can't enjoy my dinner. 
   The snails, as I prong them forth, are such ugly, slimy, greasy black horrors 
   --- oh! so like my soul! ... Ugh!<br>
   I write a letter to F---r and sign myself with a broken pentagram.<br>
   It makes me think of a "busted flush." ...<br>
   But through all the sunlight peeps: "e.g.", These six snails were 
   my six inferior souls; the seventh, the real soul, cannot be eaten by the devourer.<br>
   How's that for high? 
 </p><p> 8.3. Possibly a rousing mantra would fix things up; say the Old Favorite:<br>
 </p><blockquote> Aum Tat Sat Aum</blockquote>
 and give the Hindus a chance.<br>
 We can but try.<br>
 So I begin at once. 
 <p> 9.10. This is past all bearing. Another hour wasted chatting to Nina and H---. 
   The mantra hardly remembered {121} at all. I have gone to bed, and shall take 
   things in hand seriously, if it kills me. 
 </p><p> 9.53. Since 9.17 have done Pranayama, though allowing myself some irregularities 
   in the way of occasional omission of a Kambhakham.<br>
   'Tis very hard to stick to it. I find myself, at the end of above sentence, 
   automatically crawling into bed. No John! 
 </p><p> 10.14 Have been trying to extract some sense from that extraordinary treatise 
   on mysticism, "Konx Om Pax."<br>
   Another failure, but an excusable one.<br>
   I will now beseech Adonai as best I may to give me back my lost powers.<br>
   For I am no more even a magician! So lost am I in the illusions that I have 
   made in the Search for Adonai, that I am become the vilest of them all! 
 </p><p> 10.27. A strange and unpleasant experience. My thought suddenly transmuted 
   itself into a muscular cry, so that my legs gave a violent jerk. This I expect 
   is at bottom the explanation of the Bhuchari-Siddhi. A very bad form of uncontrolled 
   thought. I was on the edge of sleep; it woke me.<br>
   The fact is, all is over! I am done! I have tried for the Great Initiation and 
   I have failed: I am swept away into strange hells.<br>
   Lord Adonai! let the fires be informing; let them "balance, assain assoil."<br>
   I suppose this rash attempt will end in Locomotor Ataxia or G. P.<br>
   I. {122}<br>
   Let it! I'm going on. 
 </p><p> 11.47. The first power to return is the power to suffer.<br>
   The shame of it! The torture of it!<br>
   I slept in patches as a man sleeps that is deadly ill. I am only afraid of failing 
   to wake for the End of the day.<br>
   God! what a day!<br>
   ...I dare not trust my will to keep me awake; so I rise, wash, and will walk 
   about till time to get into my Asana.<br>
   Thirst! Oh how I thirst!<br>
   I had not thought that there could be such suffering. 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"> <em>The Eleventh Day</em></h3>
 <p> 12.19. It seems a poor thing to be proud of, merely to be awake. Yet I was 
   flushed with triumph as a boy that wins his first race.<br>
   The powers of Asana and Pranayama return. I did 21 Breath-cycles without fatigue.<br>
   Energy returns, and Keenness to pursue the Path --- all fruits of that one little 
   victory over sleep.<br>
   How delicate are these powers, so simple as they seem! Let me be very humble, 
   now and for every more! Surely at least that lesson has been burnt into me.<br>
   And how gladly I would give all these powers for the One Power! 
 </p><p> 12.33. Another smart attack of diarrhoea. I take 4 gr. Plumb c. Opio and alter 
   my determination to stay out of bed all night, as chill is doubtless the chief 
   cause.<br>
   ... It is really extraordinary how the smallest success {123} awakes a monstrous 
   horde of egoistic devils, vain, strutting peacocks, preening and screaming!<br>
   This is simply damnable. Egoism is the spur of all energy, in a way; and in 
   this particular case it is the one thing that is not Adonai (whatever else may 
   be) and so the antithesis of the Work. Bricks without straw, Indeed! That's 
   nothing to it. This job is like being asked to judge a Band contest and being 
   told that one may do anything but listen. Only worse! One could form some idea 
   of how they were playing through other senses; in this case " "every" 
   faculty is the enemy of the Work. At first sight the problem seems insoluble. 
   It may be so, for me. At least, I have not solved it. Yet I have come very near 
   it, many a time, of old; have solved it indeed, though in a less important sense 
   than now I seek. I am not to be content with little or with much; but only with 
   the Ultimate Attainment.<br>
   Apparently the method is just this; to store up --- no matter how --- great 
   treasures of energy and purity, until they begin to do the work themselves (in 
   the way that the Hindus call Sukshma). Just so the engineer --- five feet six 
   in his boots --- and his men build the dam. The snows melt on the mountains, 
   the river rises, and the land is irrigated, in a way that is quite independent 
   of the physical strength of that Five foot Six of engineer. The engineer might 
   even be swept away and drowned by the forces he had himself organized. So also 
   the Kingdom of Heaven. {124}<br>
   And now (12.57) John St. John will turn himself to sleep, invoking Adonai. 
 </p><p> 1.17. Can neither sleep nor concentrate.<br>
   Instead grotesque "astral" images of a quite base gargoylish type.<br>
   I suppose I shall have to pentagram them off like a damned neophyte. " 
   "Je m'emmerde!" 
 </p><p> 3.8. Praise the Lord, I wake! If that can be called waking which is a mere 
   desperate struggle to keep the eyes open. 
 </p><p> 3.18. Pranayama all wrong --- very difficult. Rose, washed, drank a few drops 
   of water. (N.B. --- To-night have drunk several times, a mouthful at a time; 
   other nights, and days, no. All entries into body recorded duly.) 
 </p><p> 3.30. Have done 10 Breath-Cycles; am quite awake.<br>
   It will therefore now be lawful again to sleep. 
 </p><p> 8.12. Awoke at 7.40, read a letter which arrived, and tried quite vainly to 
   concentrate. 
 </p><p> 8.52. Have risen, written a letter. Will break my fast --- caf croissant 
   --- and go a walk with the New Mantra, using my recently invented method of 
   doing Pranayama on the march. The weather is again perfect. 
 </p><p> 9.14. Breakfast --- eaten Yogin-wise --- at an end. The walk begins. 
 </p><p> 11.15. The walk over. Kept mantra going well enough. {125}<br>
   Made also considerations concerning the Nature of the Path.<br>
   The upshot is that it does not matter. Acquire full power of Concentration; 
   the rest is only leather and prunella.<br>
   Don't worry; work!<br>
   I shall now make a pantacle to aid the said faculty of concentration.<br>
   The Voice of the Nadi (by the way) is resounding well, and the Chittam is a 
   little better under control. 1.5. Have worked well on the Pantacle, thinking 
   of Adonai. Of course we are now reduced to a "low anthropomorphic conception" 
   --- but what odds? Once the Right Thought comes it will transcend any and all 
   conceptions. The objection is as silly as the objection to illustrating Geometry 
   by Diagrams, on the ground that printed lines are thick --- and so on.<br>
   This is the imbecility of the "Protestant" objection to images.<br>
   What fools these mortals be!<br>
   The Greeks, too, after exhausting all their sublimest thoughts of Zeus and Hades 
   and Poseidon, found that they could not find a fitting image of the All, the 
   supreme --- so they just carved a goat-man, saying: Let this represent Pan!<br>
   Also in the holiest place of the most secret temple there is an empty shrine.<br>
   But whoso goes there in the first instance thinks; There is no God.<br>
   He who goes there at the End, when he has adored all the other deities, knoweth 
   that No God. {126}<br>
   So also I go through all the Ritual, and try all the Means; at the End it may 
   be I shall find No rituals and No means, but an act or a silence so simple that 
   it cannot be told or understood.<br>
   Lord Adonai, bring me to the End! 
 </p><p> 1.25. After writing above, and adding a few touches to the Pantacle, am ready 
   to go to lunch. 
 </p><p> 1.45. Arrived at Panthon, with mantra.<br>
   Rumpsteak aux pommes souffles, poire, 1/2 Evian, and the three Cs.<br>
   Was meditating on asceticism. John Tweed once told me that Swami Vivekananda, 
   towards the end of his life, wrote a most pathetic letter deploring that his 
   sanctity forbad his "going on the bust."<br>
   What a farce is such sanctity! How much wiser for the man to behave as a man, 
   the God as a God!<br>
   This is my real bed-rock objection to the Eastern systems. They decry all manly 
   virtue as dangerous and wicked; and they look upon Nature as evil. True enough, 
   everything is evil relatively to Adonai; for all stain is impurity. A bee's 
   swarm is evil --- inside one's clothes. "Dirt is matter in the wrong place." 
   It is dirt to connect sex with statuary, morals with art.<br>
   Only Adonai, who is in a sense the True Meaning of everything, cannot defile 
   any idea. This is a hard saying, though true, for nothing of course is dirtier 
   than to try and use Adonai as a fig- leaf for one's shame.<br>
   To seduce women under pretence of religion is unutterable {127} foulness; though 
   both adultery and religion are themselves clean.<br>
   To mix jam and mustard is a messy mistake. 
 </p><p> 2.5. It also struck me that this Operation is (among other things) an attempt 
   to prove the proposition:<br>
   Reward is the direct and immediate consequence of Work.<br>
   Of all the holy illuminated Men of God of my acquaintance, I am the only one 
   that holds this opinion.<br>
   But I think that this Record, when I have time to go through it, and stand at 
   some distance, to get the perspective, will be proved a conclusive proof of 
   my thesis. I think that every failure will be certainly traceable to my own 
   dam foolishness; every little success to courage, skill, wit, tenacity.<br>
   If I had but a little more of these! 
 </p><p> 2.22. I further take this opportunity of asserting my Atheism. I believe that 
   all these phenomena are as explicable as the formation of hoar-frost or of glacier 
   tables.<br>
   I believe "Attainment" to be a simple supreme sane state of the human 
   brain. I do not believe in miracles; I do not think that God could cause a monkey, 
   clergyman, or rationalist to attain. I am taking all this trouble of the Record 
   principally in hope that it will show exactly what mental and physical conditions 
   precede, accompany, and follow "attainment" so that others may reproduce, 
   through those conditions, that Result {128} I believe in the Law of Cause and 
   Effect --- and I loathe the cant alike of the Superstitionist and the Rationalist.

 I believe in Charles Darwin Almighty, maker of Evolution; and in Ernst Haeckel, 
 his only son our Lord Who for us men and for our salvation came down from Germany: 
 who was conceived of Weissmann, born of Bchner, suffered under du Bois-Raymond, 
 was printed, bound, and shelved: who was raised again into English (of sorts), 
 ascended into the Pantheon of the Literary Guide and sitteth on the right hand 
 of Edward Clodd: whence he shall come to judge the thick in the head.<br>
 I believe in Charles Watts; the Rationalist Press Association; the annual dinner 
 at the Trocadero Restaurant; the regularity of subscriptions, the resurrection 
 in a sixpenny edition, and the Book-stall everlasting.<br>
 AMEN. 
 <p> 3.0. Arrived at Brenner's studio, and went on with the "moulage" 
   of my Asana. 
 </p><p> 4.20. Left the Studio; walk with mantra. 
 </p><p> 4.55. Mantra-march. Pranayama; quick-time. Very bracing and<br>
   fatiguing, both. At Dme to drink a citron press.<br>
   Reflections have been in my mind upon the grossness of the Theistic conception, 
   as shewn even in such pictures as Raphael's and Fra Angelico's. {129}<br>
   How infinitely subtler and nobler is the contemplation of 
 </p><blockquote> The Utmost God<br>
   Hid i' th' middle o'matter,</blockquote>
 <p> <br>
   the inscrutable mystery of the nature of common things. With what awe does the 
   wise man approach a speck of dust!<br>
   And it is this Mystery that I approach!<br>
   For Thou, Adonai, art the immanent and essential Soul of Things; not separate 
   from them, or from me; but That which is behind the shadow-show, the Cause of 
   all, the Quintessence of all, the Transcender of all.<br>
   And Thee I seek insistently; though Thou hide Thyself in the Heaven, there will 
   I seek Thee out; though Thou wrap Thyself in the Flames of the Abyss, even there 
   will I pursue Thee; Though Thou make Thee a secret place in the Heart of the 
   Rose or at the Arms of the Cross that spanneth all-embracing Space; though Thou 
   be in the inmost part of matter, or behind the Veil of mind; Thee will I follow; 
   Thee will I overtake; Thee will I gather into my being.<br>
   So thus as I chase Thee from fastness to fastness of my brain, as Thou throwest 
   out against me Veil after Magic Veil of glory, or of fear, or of despair, or 
   of desire; it matters nothing; at the End I shall attain to Thee --- oh my Lord 
   Adonai!<br>
   And even as the Capture is delight, is not the Chase also delight? For we are 
   lovers from the Beginning, though it pleasure Thee to play the Syrinx to my 
   Pan. {130} Is it not the springtide, and are these not the Arcadian groves? 
 </p><p> 5.31. At home; settling to strictest meditation upon Adonai my Lord; willing 
   His presence, the Perfume and the Vision, even as it is written in the Book 
   of the Sacred Magick of Abramelin the Mage. 
 </p><p> 8.6. Soon this became a sleep, though the will was eager and concentrated.<br>
   The sleep, too, was deep and refreshing. I will go to dinner. 
 </p><p> 8.22. Arrived, with mantra, at the Caf de Versailles. 
 </p><p> 9.10. 1/2 doz. Marennes, Rable de Livre, citron press.<br>
   I am now able to concentrate OFF the Path for a little.<br>
   Whether this means that I am simply slipping back into the world, or that I 
   am more balanced on, and master of, the Path, I cannot say. 
 </p><p> 10.4. Have walked home, drunk a citron press at the Dme, and prepare 
   for the night.<br>
   As I crossed the boulevard, I looked to the bright moon, high and stately in 
   the east, for a message. And there came to me this passage from the Book of 
   Abramelin:<br>
   "And thou wilt begin to inflame thyself in praying" ...<br>
   It is the sentence which goes on to declare the Result. (P.S. --- With this 
   rose that curious feeling of confidence, sure premonition of success, that one 
   gets in most physical tasks, but especially when one is going to get {131} down 
   a long putt or a tricky one. Whether it means more than that perception and 
   execution have got into unison (for once) and know it, I cannot say.)<br>
   It is well that thus should close this eleventh day of my Retirement, and the 
   thirty-third year of my life.<br>
   Thirty and three years was this temple in building. ... It has always been my 
   custom on this night to look back over the year, and to ask: What have I done?<br>
   The answer is invariably "Nothing."<br>
   Yet of what men count deeds I have done no small share. I have travelled a bit, 
   written a bit ... I seem to have been hard at it all the time --- and to have 
   got nothing finished or successful.<br>
   One Tragedy --- one little comedy --- two essays --- a dozen poems or so --- 
   two or three short stories --- odds and ends of one sort and another: it's a 
   miserable record, though the Tragedy is good enough to last a life. It marks 
   an epoch in literature, though nobody else will guess it for fifty years yet.<br>
   The travel, too, has been rubbish. It's been a petty, peddling year.<br>
   The one absolute indication is: on no account live otherwise than alone.<br>
   But it is 10.35; these considerations, though in a way pertaining to the Work, 
   are not the Work itself.<br>
   Let me "begin to inflame myself in praying!" 
 </p><h3 align="center" class="heading"> <em>The Twelfth Day</em></h3>
 <p> 12.17. When therefore I had made ready the chamber, so that all was dark, 
   save for the Lamp upon the Altar, I {132} began as recorded above, to inflame 
   myself in praying, calling upon my Lord; and I burned in the Lamp that Pantacle 
   which I had made of Him, renouncing the Images, destroying the Images, that 
   Himself might arise in me.<br>
   And the Chamber was filled with that wondrous glow of ultra- violet light self-luminous, 
   without a source, that hath no counterpart in Nature unless it be in that Dawn 
   of the North. ...<br>
   And there were reveled unto me certain Words of Power...<br>
   And I invoked my Lord and recited the Book Ararita at the Altar<br>
   ...<br>
   This holy inspired book (delivered unto me in the winter of last year) was now 
   at last understanded of me; for it is, though I knew it not, a complete scheme 
   of this Operation.<br>
   For this cause I will add this book Ararita at the end of the Manuscript. [This 
   has not been permitted. The Book Ararita will be issued by the A.'. A.'. in 
   due course. --- ED.] I also demanded of mine Angel the Writing upon the Lamen 
   of Silver; a Writing of the veritable Elixir and supernal Dew. And it was granted 
   unto me.<br>
   Then subtly, easily, simply, imperceptibly gliding, I passed away into nothing. 
   And I was wrapped in the black brilliance of my Lord, that interpenetrated me 
   in every part, fusing its light with my darkness, and leaving there no darkness, 
   but pure light.<br>
   Also I beheld my Lord in a figure and I felt the interior {133} trembling kindle 
   itself into a Kiss --- and I perceived the true Sacraments --- and I beheld 
   in one moment all the mystic visions in one; and the Holy Graal appeared unto 
   me, and many other inexpressible things were know of me.<br>
   Also I was given to enjoy the subtle Presence of my Lord interiorly during the 
   whole of this twelfth day.<br>
   Then I besought the Lord that He would take me into His presence eternally even 
   now.<br>
   But He withdrew Himself, for that I must do that which I was sent hither to 
   do; namely, to rule the earth.<br>
   Therefore with sweetness ineffable He parted from me; yet leaving a comfort 
   not to be told, a Peace ... the Peace. And the Light and the Perfume do certainly 
   yet remain with me in the little Chamber, and I know that my Redeemer liveth, 
   and that He shall stand at the latter day upon the earth.<br>
   For I am He that liveth, and was dead; and behold! I am alive for evermore, 
   and have the Keys of Hell and of Death. I am Amoun the Sun in His rising; I 
   have passed from darkness into Light. I am Asar Un-nefer the Perfected One. 
   I am the Lord of Life, triumphant over death. ...<br>
   There is no part of me that is not of the Gods. ... 
 </p><blockquote> The dead man Ankh-af-na-khonsu<br>
   Saith with his voice of truth and calm:<br>
   Oh Thou that has a single arm!<br>
   O Thou that glitterest in the moon!<br>
   I weave Thee in the spinning charm;<br>
   I lure thee with the billowy tune. {134} 
   <p> <br>
     The dead man Ankh-af-na-khonsu<br>
     Hath parted from the darkling crowds,<br>
     Hath joined the dwellers of the light,<br>
     Opening Duant, the star-abodes;<br>
     Their keys receiving.<br>
     The dead man Ankh-af-na-khonsu<br>
     Hath made his passage into night,<br>
     His pleasure on the earth to do<br>
     Among the living. 
   </p><p> <br>
     Amen<br>
     Amen without lie<br>
     Amen, and Amen of Amen. 
 </p></blockquote>
 12.40. I shall lie down to sleep in my robes, still wearing the Ring of the Masters, 
 and bearing my wand in my hand.<br>
 For to me now sleep is the same as waking, and life the same as death.<br>
 In Thy L.V.X. are not light and darkness but twin children that chase each other 
 in their play? 
 <p> 7.55. Awoke from long sweet dreamless sleep, like a young eagle that soars 
   to greet the dawn. 
 </p><p> 9.20. After breakfast, have strolled, on my way to the studio, through the 
   garden of the Luxembourg to my favourite fountain. It is useless to attempt 
   to write of the dew and the flowers in the clear October sunlight.<br>
   Yet the light which I behold is still more than sunlight. My eyes too are quite 
   weak from the Vision; I cannot bear the brilliance of things.<br>
   The clock of the Senate strikes; and my ears are ravished with&gt; its mysterious 
   melody. It is the infinite interior movement of things, secured by the co-extension 
   {135} of their sum with the all, that transcends the deadly opposites; change 
   which implies decay, stability which spells monotony.<br>
   I understand all the Psalms of Benediction; there is spontaneous praise, a fountain 
   in my heart. The authors of the Psalms must have known something of this Illumination 
   when they wrote them. 
 </p><p> 9.30. It seems, too, that this Operation is transformed. I suppose it must 
   read as a patchwork of most inharmonious colour, a thing without continuity 
   or cohesion. To me, now, it appears from the very start a simple direct progress 
   in one straight line. I can hardly remember that there were checks.<br>
   Of course my rational memory picking out details finds otherwise. But I seem 
   to have two memories almost as if belonging to two strata of being. In Qabalastic 
   language, my native consciousness is now Neschamah, not Ruach or Nephesch.<br>
   ... I really cannot write more. This writing is a descent into<br>
   Ruach, and I want to abide where I am. 
 </p><p> 11.17. At 10.0 arrived at Brenner's studio, and took the pose. At once, automatically, 
   the interior trembling began again, and again the subtle brilliance flowed through 
   me.<br>
   The consciousness again died and was reborn as the divine, always without shock 
   or stress.<br>
   How easy is magic, once the way is found!<br>
   How still is the soul! The turbid spate of emotion has ceased; the heavy particles 
   of thought have sunk {136} to the bottom; how limpid, how lucid is its glimmer 
   Only from above, from the overshadowing Tree of Life, whose leaves glisten and 
   quiver in the shining wind of the Spirit, drops ever and anon, self- luminous, 
   the Dew of Immortality.<br>
   Many and wonderful also were the Visions and powers offered unto me in this 
   hour; but I refused them all; for being in my Lord and He in me, there is no 
   need of these toys. 
 </p><p> 12.0. The pose over. On this second sitting, practically no thoughts arose 
   at all to cloud the Sun; but a curious feeling that there was something more 
   to come.<br>
   Possibly the Proof, that I had demanded, the Writing on the Lamen<br>
   ... 
 </p><p> 12.40. Chez Lavenue. Certain practical considerations suggest themselves.<br>
   One would have been much better off with a proper Magical Cabinet, a disciple 
   to look after things, proper magical food ceremonially prepared, a private garden 
   to walk in ... and so on. But at least it is useful and important to know that 
   things can be done at a pinch in a great city and a small room. 
 </p><p> 1.14. The lunch is good; the kidneys were well cooked; the tarte aux fraises 
   was excellent; the Burgundy came straight from the Vat of Bacchus. The Coffee 
   and Cognac are beyond all praise; the cigar is the best Caba¤a I ever smoked. 
   {137}<br>
   I read through this volume of the Record; and I dissolve my being into quintessential 
   laughter.<br>
   The entries are some of them so funny! ... Previously, this had escaped me. 
 </p><p> 1.32. And now the Rapture of it takes me! 
 </p><p> 1.25. The exquisite beauty of the women in the Restaurant ... what John St. 
   John would have called old hags! 
 </p><p> 1.27. My soul is singing ... my soul is singing! 
 </p><p> 1.30. It matters nothing what I do ... everything goes infinitely, incredibly 
   right!<br>
   "The Lord Adonai is about me as a Thunderbolt and as a Pylon and as a Serpent 
   and as a Phallus." ... 
 </p><p> 3.17. Have had a long talk of Art with B---. "The master considers himself 
   always a student." So, therefore, whatever one may have attained, in this 
   as in Art, there is always so much more possible that one can never be satisfied.<br>
   Much less, then, satiated. 
 </p><p> 11.15. Having gone back into the life of the world --- yet a world transfigured! 
   -- I did all my little work, my little amusements, all the things that one does, 
   very quietly and beatifically. About 10.30 the rapture began to carry me away; 
   yet I withstood it and went on with my game of Billiards, for politeness' sake. 
   And even there in the Caf du Dme was the glory within me, and I 
   therein; so that every time that I failed at a stroke and stood up and drank 
   in that {138} ambrosial air, I was night falling for that intense sweetness 
   that dissolved away the soul. Even as a lover that swoons with excess of pleasure 
   at the first kiss of the belovd, even so was I, oh my Lord Adonai! Wherefore 
   I am come hither to my chamber to enflame myself in praying at the Altar that 
   I have set up. And I am ready, robed, armed, anointed. ... 
 </p><p> 11.35. Ardesco! ....................
