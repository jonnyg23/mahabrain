 <p>51. Let not the failure and the pain turn aside the worshippers. The foundations 
   of the pyramid were hewn in the living rock ere sunset; did the king weep at 
   dawn that the crown of the pyramid was yet unquarried in the distant land?</p>
 <p>52. There was also an humming-bird that spake unto the horned cerastes, and 
   prayed him for poison. And the great snake of Khem the Holy One, the royal Uræus 
   serpent, answered him and said:</p>
 <p>53. I sailed over the sky of Nu in the car called Millions-of-Years, and I 
   saw not any creature upon Seb that was equal to me. The venom of my fang is 
   the inheritance of my father, and of my father's father; and how shall I give 
   it unto thee? Live thou and thy children as I and my fathers have lived, even 
   unto an hundred millions of generations, and it may be that the mercy of the 
   Mighty Ones may bestow upon thy children a drop of the poison of eld.</p>
 <p>54. Then the humming-bird was afflicted in his spirit, and he flew unto the 
   flowers, and it was as if naught had been spoken between them. Yet in a little 
   while a serpent struck him that he died.</p>
 <p>55. But an Ibis that meditated upon the bank of Nile the beautiful god listened 
   and heard. And he laid aside his Ibis ways, and became as a serpent, saying 
   Peradventure in an hundred millions of millions of generations of my children, 
   they shall attain to a drop of the poison of the fang of the Exalted One.</p>
 <p>56. And behold! ere the moon waxed thrice he became an Uræus serpent, and the 
   poison of the fang was established in him and his seed even for ever and for 
   ever.</p>
 <p align="center"><em>- Liber LXV</em>, Cap. V </p>
 <p>I. <em>The Probationer</em>. His duties are laid down in Paper A, Class D. 
   Being without, they are vague and general. He receives Liber LXI and LXV.</p>
 <p>[Certain Probationers are admitted after six months or more to Ritual XXVIII.]</p>
 <p>At the end of the Probation he passes Ritual DCLXXI, which constitutes him 
   a Neophyte.</p>

   receives Liber VII.</p>

 <p>Examination in Posture and Control of Breath (see Equinox No. 1). Practical.</p>
 <p>Further, he is given two meditation-practices corresponding to the two rituals 
   DCLXXI and CXX.</p>
 <p>(Examination is only in the knowledge of, and some little practical acquaintance 
   with, these meditations. The complete results, if attained, would confer a much 
   higher grade.)</p>
 <p>Further, he forges the magic Sword.</p>
 <p>No ritual admits to the grade of Practicus, which is conferred by authority 
   when the task of the Zelator is accomplished.</p>

 <p>Instruction and Examination in the Qabalah and Liber DCCLXXVII. </p>

 <p>He is given meditation-practices on the Control of Thought, and is instructed 
   in Raja-Yoga.</p>
 <p>He receives Liber Mysteriorum and obtains a perfect understanding of the Formulae 
   of Initiation.</p>
 <p>He meditates upon the diverse knowledge and power that he has acquired, and 
   harmonises it perfectly.</p>
 <p>Further, he lights the Magic Lamp.</p>
 <p>At last, Ritual VIII admits him to the grade of Adeptus Minor. </p>
 <p>6. <em>The Adeptus Minor</em>. His duty is laid down in Paper F, Class D.</p>
 <p>It is to follow out the instruction given in the Vision of the Eighth Aethyr 
   for the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of the Holy Guardian Angel.</p>
 <p>[NOTE. This is in truth the sole task; the others are useful only as adjuvants 
   to and preparations for the One Work.</p>
 <p>Moreover, once this task has been accomplished, there is no more need of human 
   help or instruction; for by this alone may the highest attainment be reached.</p>
 <p>All these grades are indeed but convenient landmarks, not necessarily significant. 
   A person who had attained them all might be immeasurably the inferior of one 
   who had attained none of them; it is Spiritual Experience alone that counts 
   in Result; the rest is but Method.</p>
 <p>Yet it is important to possess knowledge and power, provided that it be devoted 
   wholly to that One Work.]
