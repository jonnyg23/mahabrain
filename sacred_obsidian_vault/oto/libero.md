 <p>These are all halftone photos of a single human in a black Tau robe, barefoot 
   with hood completely closed over the face. The hood displays a six-pointed figure 
   on the forehead --- presumably the radiant eye of Horus of the A.'. A.'., but 
   the rendition is too poor in detail. There is a cross pendant over the heart. 
   The ten panels are numbered in white in the upper left, but the numerals are 
   very dim even in the Ist edition (some blurred out entirely in the Weiser edition).</p>
 <p>The panels are identified by two columns of numbered captions, 1 to 6 to the 
   left and 7 to 10 to the right. The description is bottom to top and left to 
   right:</p>
 <p align="center"><img height="480" src="images/102_012.jpg" width="381"><br clear="left">
 </p>
 <p>"1. Earth: the god Set fighting." Frontal figure. Rt. foot pointed 
   to the fore and angled slightly outward with weight on ball of foot. Lf. heel 
   touching Rt. heel and foot pointed left. Arms form a diagonal with body, right 
   above head and in line with left at waist height. Hands palmer and open with 
   fingers outstretched and together. Head erect.</p>
 <p>"2. Air: The god Shu supporting the sky." Frontal. Heels together 
   and slightly angled apart to the front, flat on floor. Head down. Arms angled 
   up on either side of head about head 1.5 ft. from head to wrist and crooked 
   as if supporting a ceiling just at head height with the finger tips. The palms 
   face upward and the backs of the hands away from the head. Thumbs closed to 
   side of palms. Fingers straight and together.</p>
 <p>"3. Water: the goddess Auramoth." Same body and foot position as 
   #2, but head erect. Arms are brought down over the chest so that the thumbs 
   touch above the heart and the backs of the hands are to the front. The fingers 
   meet below the heart, forming between thumbs and fingers the descending triangle 
   of water.</p>
 <p>"4. Fire: the goddess Thoum-aesh-neith." Frontal. Head and body like 
   #3. Arms are angled so that the thumbs meet in a line over the brow. Palmer 
   side facing. Fingers meet above head, forming between thumbs and fingers the 
   ascending triangle of fire.</p>
 <p>"5,6. Spirit: the rending and closing of the veil." Head erect in 
   both. #5 has the same body posture as #1, except that the left and right feet 
   are countercharged and flat on the floor. Arms and hands are crooked forward 
   at shoulder level such that the hands appear to be clawing open a split veil 
   --- hands have progressed to a point that the forearms are invisible, being 
   directly pointed at the front. Upper arms are flat and horizontal in the plain 
   of the image. #6. has the same body posture as #1, feet in same position as 
   #1 but flat to the floor. The arms are elbow down against abdomen, with hands 
   forward over heart in claws such that the knuckles are touching. Passing from 
   #5 to #6 or vice versa is done by motion of shoulders and rotation of wrists. 
   This is different from the other sign of opening the veil, the Sign of the Enterer, 
   with is done with hands flat palm to palm and then spread without rotation of 
   wrists.</p>
 <p>"7-10. The L V X signs."</p>
 <p>"7. + Osiris slain --- the cross." Body and feet as in #2. Head bowed. 
   Arms directly horizontal from the shoulders in the plane of the image. Hands 
   with fingers together, thumbs to side of palm and palmer side forward. The tau 
   shape of the robe dominates the image.</p>
 <p>"8. L Isis mourning --- the Svastica." The body is in semi-profile, 
   head down slightly and facing right of photograph. The arms, hands, legs and 
   feet are positioned to define a swastika. Left foot flat, carrying weight and 
   angled toward the right of the photo. Right foot toe down behind the figure 
   to the left in the photo. Right upper arm due left in photo and forearm vertical 
   with fingers closed and pointing upward. Left arm smoothly canted down to the 
   right of photo, with fingers closed and pointed down.</p>
 <p>"9. V Typhon --- the Trident." Figure frontal and standing on tip 
   toe, toes forward and heals not touching. Head back. Arms angled in a "V" 
   with the body to the top and outward in the plain of the photo. Fingers and 
   thumbs as #7, but continuing the lines of the arms.</p>
 <p>"10. X Osiris risen --- the Pentagram." Body and feet as in #7. Head 
   directly frontal and level. Arms crossed over heart, right over left with hands 
   extended, fingers closed and thumb on side such that the palms rest on the two 
   opposite shoulders.}</p>

   I.</h3>
 <p>1. This book is very easy to misunderstand; readers are asked to use the most 
   minute critical care in the study of it, even as we have done in its preparation.</p>
 <p>2. In this book it is spoken of the Sephiroth and the Paths; of Spirits and 
   Conjurations; of Gods, Spheres, Planes, and many other things which may or may 
   not exist.</p>
 <p>It is immaterial whether these exist or not. By doing certain things certain 
   results will follow; students are most earnestly warned against attributing 
   objective reality or philosophic validity to any of them.</p>
 <p>3. The advantages to be gained from them are chiefly these:<br>
   ("a") A widening of the horizon of the mind.<br>
   ("b") An improvement of the control of the mind.</p>
 <p>4. The student, if he attains any success in the following practices, will 
   find himself confronted by things (ideas or {13} beings) too glorious or too 
   dreadful to be described. It is essential that he remain the master of all that 
   he beholds, hears or conceives; otherwise he will be the slave of illusion, 
   and the prey of madness.</p>
 <p>Before entering upon any of these practices, the student should be in good 
   health, and have attained a fair mastery of Asana, Pranayama and Dharana.</p>
 <p>5. There is little danger that any student, however idle or stupid, will fail 
   to get some result; but there is great danger that he will be led astray, obsessed 
   and overwhelmed by his results, even though it be by those which it is necessary 
   that he should attain. Too often, moreover, he mistaketh the first resting-place 
   for the goal, and taketh off his armour as if he were a victor ere the fight 
   is well begun.</p>
 <p>It is desirable that the student should never attach to any result the importance 
   which it at first seems to possess.</p>
 <p>6. First, then, let us consider the Book "777" and its use; the preparation 
   of the Place; the use of the Magic Ceremonies; and finally the methods which 
   follow in Chapter V. "Viator in Regnis Arboris," and in Chapter VI. 
   "Sagitta trans Lunam."</p>
 <p>(In another book will it be treated of the Expansion and Contraction of Consciousness; 
   progress by slaying the Chakkrams; progress by slaying the Pairs of Opposites; 
   the methods of Sabhapaty Swami, &amp;c., &amp;c.)</p>
 <h3 align="center" class="heading">II.</h3>
 <p>1. The student must FIRST obtain a thorough knowledge of "Book 777", 
   especially of columns i., ii., iii., v., vi., vii., ix., xi., xii., xiv., xv., 
   xvi., xvii., xviii., xix., xxxiv., xxxv., xxxviii., {14} xxxix., xl., xli., 
   xlii., xlv., liv., lv., lix., lx., lxi., lxiii., lxx., lxxv., lxxvii., lxviii., 
   lxxix., lxxx., lxxxi., lxxxiii., xcvii., xcviii., xcix., c., ci., cxvii., cxviii., 
   cxxxvii., cxxxviii., cxxxix., clxxv., clxxvi., clxxvii., clxxxii.</p>
 <p>When these are committed to memory, he will begin to understand the nature 
   of these correspondences. ("See" Illustrations "The Temple of 
   Solomon the King" in this number. Cross references are given.)</p>
 <p>2. If we take an example, the use of the table will become clear.<br>
   Let us suppose that you wish to obtain knowledge of some obscure science.<br>
   In column xlv., line 12, you will find "Knowledge of Sciences." </p>
 <p>By now looking up line 12 in the other columns, you will find that the Planet 
   corresponding is Mercury, its number eight, its lineal figures the octagon and 
   octagram. The God who rules that planet Thoth, or in Hebrew symbolism Tetragrammaton 
   Adonai and Elohim Tzabaoth, its Archangel Raphael, its Choir of Angels Beni 
   Elohim, its Intelligence Tiriel, its Spirit Taphtatharath, its colours Orange 
   (for Mercury is the Sphere of the Sephira Hod, 8), Yellow, Purple, Grey, and 
   Indigo rayed with Violet; its Magical Weapon the Wand or Caduceus, its Perfumes 
   Mastic and others, its sacred plants Vervain and others, its jewel the Opal 
   or Agate; its sacred animal the Snake, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
 <p>3. You would then prepare your Place of Working accordingly. In an orange circle 
   you would draw an eight-pointed star of yellow, at whose points you would place 
   eight lamps. The Sigil of the Spirit (which is to be found in Cornelius {15} 
   Agrippa and other books) you would draw in the four colours with such other 
   devices as your experience may suggest.</p>
 <p>4. And so on. We cannot here enter at length into all the necessary preparations; 
   and the student will find them fully set forth in the proper books, of which 
   the "Goetia" is perhaps the best example.</p>
 <p>These rituals need not be slavishly imitated; on the contrary the student should 
   do nothing the object of which he does not understand; also, if he have any 
   capacity whatever, he will find his own crude rituals more effective than the 
   highly polished ones of other people.</p>
 <p>The general purpose of all this preparation is as follows:<br>
   5. Since the student is a man surrounded by material objects, if it be his wish 
   to master one particular idea, he must make every material object about him 
   directly suggest that idea. Thus in the ritual quoted, if his glance fall upon 
   the lights, their number suggests Mercury; he smells the perfumes, and again 
   Mercury is brought to his mind. In other words, the whole magical apparatus 
   and ritual is a complex system of mnemonics.</p>
 <p>[The importance of these lies principally in the fact that particular sets 
   of images that the student may meet in his wanderings correspond to particular 
   lineal figures, divine names, &amp;c. and are controlled by them. As to the 
   possibility of producing results external to the mind of the seer ("objective," 
   in the ordinary common sense acceptation of the term) we are here silent.]</p>
 <p>6. There are three important practices connected with all forms of ceremonial 
   (and the two Methods which later we shall describe). These are: {16}<br>
   (1) Assumption of God-forms.<br>
   (2) Vibration of Divine Names.<br>
   (3) Rituals of "Banishing" and "Invoking".<br>
   These, at least, should be completely mastered before the dangerous Methods 
   of Chapters V. and VI. are attempted.</p>
 <h3 align="center" class="heading">III</h3>
 <p>1. The Magical Images of the Gods of Egypt should be made thoroughly familiar. 
   This can be done by studying them in any public museum, or in such books as 
   may be accessible to the student. They should then be carefully painted by him, 
   both from the model and from memory.</p>
 <p>2. The student, seated in the "God" position, or in the characteristic 
   attitude of the God desired, should then imagine His image as coinciding with 
   his own body, or as enveloping it. This must be practised until mastery of the 
   image is attained, and an identity with it and with the God experienced.</p>
 <p>It is a matter for very great regret that no simple and certain test of success 
   in this practice exists.</p>
 <p>3. The Vibration of God-names. As a further means of identifying the human 
   consciousness with that pure portion of it which man calls by the name of some 
   God, let him act thus:</p>
 <p>4. ("a") Stand with arms outstretched. ("See" illustration.)<br>
   ("b") Breathe in deeply through the nostrils, imagining the name of 
   the God desired entering with the breath.<br>
   ("c") Let that name descend slowly from the lungs to the heart, the 
   solar plexus, the navel, the generative organs, and so to the feet. {17}<br>
   ("d") The moment that it appears to touch the feet, quickly advance 
   the left foot about 12 inches, throw forward the body, and let the hands (drawn 
   back to the side of the eyes) shoot out, so that you are standing in the typical 
   position of the God Horus,["See" Illustration in Vol. I. No. 1, "Blind 
   Force."] and at the same time imagine the Name as rushing up and through 
   the body, while you breathe it out through the nostrils with the air which has 
   been till then retained in the lungs. All this must be done with all the force 
   of which you are capable. <br>
   ("e") Then withdraw the left foot, and place the right forefinger 
   upon the lips, so that you are in the characteristic position of the God Harpocrates["See" 
   Illustration in Vol. I. No. 1, "The Silent Watcher."]</p>
 <p>5. It is a sign that the student is performing this correctly when a single 
   "Vibration" entirely exhausts his physical strength. It should cause 
   him to grow hot all over, or to perspire violently, and it should so weaken 
   him that he will find it difficult to remain standing.</p>
 <p>6. It is a sign of success, though only by the student himself is it perceived, 
   when he hears the name of the God vehemently roared forth, as if by the concourse 
   of ten thousand thunders; and it should appear to him as if that Great Voice 
   proceeded from the Universe, and not from himself.</p>
 <p>In both the above practices all consciousness of anything but the God-form 
   and name should be absolutely blotted out; and the longer it takes for normal 
   perception to return, the better. {18}</p>
 <h3 align="center" class="heading">IV</h3>
 <p>I. The Rituals of the Pentagram and Hexagram must be committed to memory; they 
   are as follows:</p>
 <h3 align="center" class="heading">The Lesser Ritual of the Pentagram 
   </h3><p>(i) Touching the forehead say Ateh (Unto Thee).<br>
     (ii) Touching the breast say Malkuth (The Kingdom).<br>
     (iii) Touching the right shoulder, say ve-Geburah (and the Power).<br>
     (iv) Touching the left shoulder, say ve-Gedulah (and the Glory).<br>
     (v) Clasping the hands upon the breast, say le-Olahm, Amen (To the Ages, Amen).<br>
     (vi) Turning to the East make a pentagram (that of Earth) with the proper 
     weapon (usually the Wand). Say ("i.e." vibrate) I H V H.<br>
     (vii) Turning to the South, the same, but say A D N I.<br>
     (viii) Turning to the West, the same, but say A H I H.<br>
     (ix) Turning to the North, the same, but say A G L A.</p>
   <p>Pronounce: Ye-ho-wau, Adonai, Eheieh, Agla.</p>
   <p>(x) Extending the arms in the form of a Cross say:<br>
     (xi) Before me Raphael;<br>
     (xii) Behind me Gabriel;<br>
     (xiii) On my right hand Michael.<br>
     (xiv) On my left hand Auriel;<br>
     (xv) For about me flames the Pentagram,<br>
     (xvi) And in the Column stands the six-rayed Star.<br>
     (xvii-xxi) Repeat (i) to (v), the Qabalistic Cross. {19}</p>
   <h3 align="center" class="heading">The Greater Ritual of the Pentagram.</h3>
   The Pentagrams are traced in the air with the sword or other weapon, the name 
   <br clear="left">
   spoken aloud, and the signs used, as illustrated.

 <p>For Caput and Cauda Draconis use the lunar hexagram, with the sigil of Caput 
   Draconis or Cauda Draconis.</p>
 <p>To banish, reverse the hexagram.</p>
 <p>In all cases use a conjuration first with Ararita, and next with the name of 
   the God corresponding to the planet or sign you are dealing with.</p>
 <p>The Hexagrams pertaining to the planets are as in plate on preceding page.</p>
 <p>2. These rituals should be practised until the figures drawn appear in flame, 
   in flame so near to physical flame that it would perhaps be visible to the eyes 
   of a bystander, were one present. It is alleged that some persons have attained 
   the power of actually kindling fire by these means. Whether this be so or not, 
   the power is not one to be aimed at.</p>
 <p>3. Success in "banishing" is known by a "feeling of cleanliness" 
   in the atmosphere; success in "invoking" by a "feeling of holiness." 
   It is unfortunate that these terms are so vague.</p>
 <p>But at least make sure of this: that any imaginary figure or being shall instantly 
   obey the will of the student, when he uses the appropriate figure. In obstinate 
   cases, the form of the appropriate God may be assumed.</p>
 <p>4. The banishing rituals should be used at the commencement of any ceremony 
   whatever. Next, the student should use a general invocation, such as the "Preliminary 
   Invocation" in the "Goetia" as well as a special invocation to 
   suit the nature of his working.</p>
 <p>5. Success in these verbal invocations is so subtle a {26} matter, and its 
   grades so delicately shaded, that it must be left to the good sense of the student 
   to decide whether or not he should be satisfied with his result.</p>
 <h3 align="center" class="heading">V</h3>
 <p>1. Let the student be at rest in one of his prescribed positions, having bathed 
   and robed with the proper decorum. Let the place of working be free from all 
   disturbance, and let the preliminary purifications, banishings and invocations 
   be duly accomplished, and, lastly, let the incense be kindled.</p>
 <p>2. Let him imagine his own figure (preferably robed in the proper magical garments 
   and armed with the proper magical weapons) as enveloping his physical body, 
   or standing near to and in front of him.</p>
 <p>3. Let him then transfer the seat of his consciousness to that imagined figure; 
   so that it may seem to him that he is seeing with its eyes, and hearing with 
   its ears.</p>
 <p>This will usually be the great difficulty of the operation.</p>
 <p>4. Let him then cause that imagined figure to rise in the air to a great height 
   above the earth.</p>
 <p>5. Let him then stop and look about him. (It is sometimes difficult to open 
   the eyes.)</p>
 <p>6. Probably he will see figures approaching him, or become conscious of a landscape.</p>
 <p>Let him speak to such figures, and insist upon being answered, using the proper 
   pentagrams and signs, as previously taught.</p>
 <p>7. Let him travel about at will, either with or without guidance from such 
   figure or figures. {27}</p>
 <p>8. Let him further employ such special invocations as will cause to appear 
   the particular places he may wish to visit.</p>
 <p>9. Let him beware of the thousand subtle attacks and deceptions that he will 
   experience, carefully testing the truth of all with whom he speaks.</p>
 <p>Thus a hostile being may appear clothed with glory; the appropriate pentagram 
   will in such a case cause him to shrivel or decay.</p>
 <p>10. Practice will make the student infinitely wary in these matters.</p>
 <p>11. It is usually quite easy to return to the body, but should any difficulty 
   arise, practice (again) will make the imagination fertile. For example, one 
   may create in thought a chariot of fire with white horses, and command the charioteer 
   to drive earthwards.</p>
 <p>It might be dangerous to go too far, or to stay too long; for fatigue must 
   be avoided.</p>
 <p>The danger spoken of is that of fainting, or of obsession, or of loss of memory 
   or other mental faculty.</p>
 <p>12. Finally, let the student cause his imagined body in which he supposes himself 
   to have been travelling to coincide with the physical, tightening his muscles, 
   drawing in his breath, and putting his forefinger to his lips. Then let him 
   "awake" by a well-defined act of will, and soberly and accurately 
   record his experiences.</p>
 <p>It may be added that this apparently complicated experiment is perfectly easy 
   to perform. It is best to learn by "travelling" with a person already 
   experienced in the matter. Two or three experiments will suffice to render the 
   student confident and even expert. See also "The Seer", pp. 295-333.</p>
 <h3 align="center" class="heading">VI</h3>
 <p>1. The previous experiment has little value, and leads to few results of importance. 
   But it is susceptible of a development which merges into a form of Dharana --- 
   concentration --- and as such may lead to the very highest ends. The principal 
   use of the practice in the last chapter is to familiarise the student with every 
   kind of obstacle and every kind of delusion, so that he may be perfect master 
   of every idea that may arise in his brain, to dismiss it, to transmute it, to 
   cause it instantly to obey his will.</p>
 <p>2. Let him then begin exactly as before, but with the most intense solemnity 
   and determination.</p>
 <p>3. Let him be very careful to cause his imaginary body to rise in a line exactly 
   perpendicular to the earth's tangent at the point where his physical body is 
   situated (or to put it more simply, straight upwards).</p>
 <p>4. Instead of stopping, let him continue to rise until fatigue almost overcomes 
   him. If he should find that he has stopped without willing to do so, and that 
   figures appear, let him at all costs rise above them.</p>
 <p>Yea, though his very life tremble on his lips, let him force his way upward 
   and onward! 5. Let him continue in this so long as the breath of life is in 
   him. Whatever threatens, whatever allures, though it were Typhon and all his 
   hosts loosed from the pit and leagued against him, though it were from the very 
   Throne of God Himself that a Voice issues bidding him stay and be content, let 
   him struggle on, ever on.</p>
 <p>6. At last there must come a moment when his whole {29} being is swallowed 
   up in fatigue, overwhelmed by its own inertia.<strong>*</strong> </p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p><strong>*</strong> This in case of failure. The results of success are so 
     many and wonderful that no effort is here made to describe them. They are 
     classified, tentatively, in the "Herb 
     Dangerious," Part II., "infra".</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>Let him sink (when no longer can he strive, though his tongue by bitten through 
   with the effort and the blood gush from his nostrils) into the blackness of 
   unconsciousness; and then, on coming to himself, let him write down soberly 
   and accurately a record of all that hath occurred, yea a record of all that 
   hath occurred.</p>
