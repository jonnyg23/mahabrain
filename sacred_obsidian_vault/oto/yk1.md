 KHIEN Originating from the term, piercing
 advantageous, right and firm.
 
 
 The dragon lurks: it is no time to act.
 The dragon's in the field: now make thy pact.
 Be active, watchful, using care and tact.
 The dragon leaps; a bursting cataract.
 The dragon ploughs the sky with pace exact.
 Exceed not, dragon; Lest thy force react.
 
 (If all this heavenly hosts of dragons lacked
 their heads, good fortune would become a fact.)

 KHWAN: Great, originating, right and fair,
 piercing and helpful, firm as in the mare.
 If the true man should move, his feet will stray;
 for him to follow is his proper way.
 
 
 Hoar-frost! The strong one cometh by and by.
 Straight, square and great, advantage springs to aye.
 Maintain, but boast not virtue's majesty.
 Here is a sack made safe by skillful tie.
 Behold the yellow skirt; ill fortune fly.
 Dragons at war: Gold, blood and porphyry.
 
 
 (Correct and firm the conduct, thou shalt spy
 good fortune from the sky.)

 Examine well, the augury of the flight.
