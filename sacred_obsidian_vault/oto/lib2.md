 <blockquote> 
   <p>``Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.''<br>
     ``There is no Law beyond Do what thou wilt.''<br>
     ``The word of the Law is Velhma.''<br>
     Velhma--Thelema--means Will.</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>The Key to this Message is this word-Will. The first obvious meaning of this 
   Law is confirmed by antithesis; ``The word of Sin is Restriction.''</p>
 <p>Again: ``Thou hast no right but to do thy will. Do that and no other shall 
   say nay. For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, 
   is every way perfect.''</p>
 <p>Take this carefully; it seems to imply a theory that if every man and every 
   woman did his and her will--the true will--there would be no clashing. ``Every 
   man and every woman is a star,'' and each star moves in an appointed path without 
   interference. There is plenty of room for all; it is only disorder that creates 
   confusion.</p>
 <p>From these considerations it should be clear that ``Do what thou wilt'' does 
   not mean ``Do what you like.'' It is the apotheosis of Freedom; but it is also 
   the strictest possible bond.</p>
 <p>Do what thou wilt--then do nothing else. Let nothing deflect thee from that 
   austere and holy task. Liberty is absolute to do thy will; but seek to do any 
   other thing whatever, and instantly obstacles must arise. Every act that is 
   not in definite course of that one orbit is erratic, an hindrance. Will must 
   not be two, but one.</p>
 <p>Note further that this will is not only to be pure, that is, single, as explained 
   above, but also ``unassuaged of purpose.'' This strange phrase must give us 
   pause. It may mean that any purpose in the will would damp it; clearly the ``lust 
   of result'' is a thing from which it must be delivered.</p>
 <p>But the phrase may also be interpreted as if it read ``with purpose unassuaged''--i.e., 
   with tireless energy. The conception is, therefore, of an eternal motion, infinite 
   and unalterable. It is Nirvana, only dynamic instead of static--and this comes 
   to the same thing in the end.</p>
 <p>The obvious practical task of the magician is then to discover what his will 
   really is, so that he may do it in this manner, and he can best accomplish this 
   by the practices of <em>Liber Thisarb</em> (see Equinox I(7), p. 105) or such 
   others as may from one time to another be appointed.</p>
 <p>Thou must (1) Find out what is thy Will. (2) Do that Will with a) one-pointedness, 
   (b) detachment, (c) peace.</p>
 <p>Then, and then only, art thou in harmony with the Movement of Things, thy will 
   part of, and therefore equal to, the Will of God. And since the will is but 
   the dynamic aspect of the self, and since two different selves could not possess 
   identical wills; then, if thy will be God's will, <em>Thou art That</em>.</p>
 <p>There is but one other word to explain. Elsewhere it is written-- surely for 
   our great comfort--``Love is the law, love under will.''</p>
 <p>This is to be taken as meaning that while Will is the Law, the nature of that 
   Will is Love. But this Love is as it were a by-product of that Will; it does 
   not contradict or supersede that Will; and if apparent contradiction should 
   arise in any crisis, it is the Will that will guide us aright. Lo, while in 
   <em>The Book of the Law</em> is much of Love, there is no word of Sentimentality. 
   Hate itself is almost like Love! ``As brothers fight ye!'' All the manly races 
   of the world understand this. The Love of <em>Liber Legis</em> is always bold, 
   virile, even orgiastic. There is delicacy, but it is the delicacy of strength. 
   Mighty and terrible and glorious as it is, however, it is but the pennon upon 
   the sacred lance of Will, the damascened inscription upon the swords of the 
   Knight-monks of Thelema.</p>
 <p align="center">Love is the law, love under will.</p>
