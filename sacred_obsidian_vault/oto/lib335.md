       habitation, Silence that foldest over its creation! [The Lion passes over.

       mid-heaven, casts but the shortest shadows. The Murmur of the Breeze I am 
       the Breeze to bless the bowers, Sigh through the trees, caress the flowers; 
       Each folded bud to sway, to swoon, With its green blood beneath the moon 
       Stirred softly by my kiss; I bear The sort reply of amber air To the exhaled

       of mountains far -- Their serried crests clasp each a star! The earths

       all earths wombs, through all seas waves, Gigantic glooms, forgotten 
       graves, I haunt the tombs of kings and slaves. I hush the babe, I wake the

       Soothe the bruised nipples of the bride, Help stars and clouds play hide-and-seek, 
       Wind seamens shrouds, bid ruins speak, Bring dreams to slumber, sleep 
       to dream Whose demons cumber nights extreme. And softer sped than 
       dream or death Quiet as the dead, or slain loves breath, I sigh for 
       loves that swoon upon The hanging groves of Babylon. Each terrace adds a 
       shower of scent Where lass and lad seduce content; Each vine that hangs 
       confirms the stress Of purer pangs of drunkenness; Each marble wall and 
       pillar swerves Majestical my course to curves Subtle as breasts and limbs 
       and tresses Of this caressed suave sorceresss That raves and rests 
       in wildernesses Whose giant gifts are strength that scars Her soul and lifts 
       her to the stars, Savage, and tenderness that tunes Her spirits splendour 
       to the moons, And music of passion to outrun The fiery fashion of 
       the sun. Hush! theres a stir not mine amid the groves, A foot divine 
       that yet is not like lives. Hush! let me furl my forehead! Ill 
       be gone To flicker and curl above great Babylon. [The Gate of the Garden
