 <h2 align="center" class="heading">INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p align="center">Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. </p>
 <p>According to Hymenaeus Alpha in his Preface to "The Holy Books of Thelema", 
   published by Samuel Weiser in 1983 only the short prefatory note is in Class 
   A, the remainder of the book is in Class B. It is therefore not considered to 
   be a "Holy Book", however since it has proven its worth otherwise, 
   and since an earnest member of the Argentum Astrum will follow the instructions 
   in that class A note, we present it to you here. </p>
 <p align="left">I have used it as part of planetary, and zodiac rituals for some 
   time, and recomend it for this purpose. Love is the law, love under will. </p>

 <ol>
   <li>Let the student recite this book, particularly the 169 adorations, unto 
     his Star as it ariseth. 
   </li><li>Let him seek out diligently in the sky his Star; let him travel thereunto 
     in his Shell; let him adore it unceasingly from its rising even unto its setting 
     by the right adorations, with chants that shall be harmonious therewith. 
   </li><li>Let him rock himself to and fro in adoration; let him spin around his own 
     axis in adoration; let him leap up and down in adoration. 
   </li><li>Let him inflame himself in the adoration, speeding from slow to fast, until 
     he can no more. 
   </li><li>This also shall be sung in open places, as heaths, mountains, woods, and 
     by streams and upon islands. 
   </li><li>Moreover, ye shall build you fortified places in great cities; caverns and 
     tombs shall be made glad with your praise. 
   </li><li>Amen. </li>

 <p align="center">Here beginneth the Book of the Meditations on the Twelvefold 
   Adora- tion, and the Unity of GOD. </p>
 <h3 align="center">The Chapter known as<br>
   The Perception of God<br>
   that is revealed unto man for a snare</h3>
 <p align="center">I adore Thee by the Twelvefold Snare and by the Unity thereof. 
 </p>
 <dl> 
   <dd>000. In the Beginning there was Naught, and Naught spake unto Naught saying: 
     Let us beget on the Nakedness of our Nothingness the Limitless, Eternal, Identical, 
     and United: And without will, intention, thought, word, desire, or deed, it 
     was so. 
   <dd>00. Then in the depths of Nothingness hovered the Limitless, as a raven 
     in the night; seeing naught, hearing naught, and understanding naught: neither 
     was it seen, nor heard, nor understood; for as yet Countenance beheld not 
     Countenance. 
   <dd>0. And as the Limitless stretched forth its wings, an unextended unextendable 
     Light became; colourless, formless, conditionless, effluent, naked, and essential, 
     as a crystalline dew of creative effulgence; and fluttering as a dove betwixt 
     Day and Night, it vibrated forth a lustral Crown of Glory. </dd>
 </dd></dd></dl>
 <ol>
   <li>And out of the blinding whiteness of the Crown grew an Eye, like unto an 
     egg of an humming-bird cherished on a platter of burnished silver. 
   </li><li>Thus I beheld Thee, O my God, the lid of whose Eye is as the Night of Chaos, 
     and the pupil thereof as the marshalled order of the spheres. 
   </li><li>For, I am but as a blind man, who wandering through the noontide perceiveth 
     not the loveliness of day; and even as he whose eyes are unenlightened beholdeth 
     not the greatness of this world in the depths of a starless night, so am I 
     who am not able to search the unfathomable depths of Thy wisdom. 
   </li><li>For what am I that I durst look upon Thy Countenance, purblind one of small 
     understanding that I am, blindly groping through the night of mine ignorance 
     like unto a little maggot hid in the dark depths of a corrupted corpse? 
   </li><li>Therefore, O my God, fashion me into a five-pointed star of ruby burning 
     beneath the foundations of Thy Unity, that I may mount the pillar of Thy Glory, 
     and be lost in adoration of the triple Unity of Thy Godhead, I beseech Thee, 
     O Thou who art to me as the Finger of Light thrust through the black clouds 
     of Chaos; I beseech Thee, O my God, hearken Thou unto my cry! 
   </li><li>Then, O my God, am I not risen as the sun that eateth up ocean as a golden 
     lion that feedeth on a blue-grey wolf? So shall I become one with Thy Beauty, 
     worn upon Thy breast as the Centre of a Sixfold Star of ruby and of sapphire. 
   </li><li>Yea, O God, gird Thou me upon Thy thigh as a warrior girdeth his sword! 
     Smite my acuteness into the earth, and as a sower casteth his seed into the 
     furrows of the plough, do Thou beget upon me these adorations of Thy Unity, 
     O My Conqueror! 
   </li><li>And Thou shalt carry me upon Thine hip, O Thou flashing God, as a black 
     mother of the South Country carrieth her babe. Whence I shall reach my lips 
     to Thy pap, and sucking out Thy stars, shed them in these adorations upon 
     the Earth. 
   </li><li>Moreover, O God my God, Thou who hast cloven me with Thine amethystine Phallus, 
     with Thy Phallus adamantine, with Thy Phallus of Gold and Ivory! thus am I 
     cleft in twain as two halves of a child that is split asunder by the sword 
     of the eunuchs, and mine adorations are divided, and one contendeth against 
     his brother. Unite Thou me even as a split tree that closeth itself again 
     upon the axe, that my song of praise unto Thee may be One Song! 
   </li><li>For I am Thy chosen Virgin, O my God! Exalt Thou me unto the throne of the 
     Mother, unto the Garden of Supernal Dew, unto the Unutterable Sea! </li>

   The Unconsciousness of God<br>

 <p align="center">I adore Thee by the Twelvefold Sign and by the Unity thereof.

 <ol>
   <li>The Light of my Life is as the light of two moons, one rising and the other 
     setting, one increasing and the other waning; the one growing fat as the other 
     groweth lean, like a paunchy thief sucking dry a skin of amber wine. Yet though 
     the light of the first devoureth the light of the second, nevertheless the 
     light of the second disgorgeth the light of the first, so that there is neither 
     the desire of light nor the need of light--- all being as a woven twilight 
     of day and night, a madness of mingling moons. Yet I behold! 
   </li><li>Now mine eyes are seven, and are as stars about a star; and the lids of 
     mine eyes are fourteen, two to each eye. Also have I seven arms to do the 
     bidding of the seven eyes; and each arm hath an hand of three fingers, so 
     that I may rule the great ocean and burn it up with the Spirit of Flame, and 
     that I may drown the fire in the Abode of the Waters. Thus I am rendered naked; 
     for neither flame nor water can clothe me; therefore am I as a breath of wind 
     blown over an Earth of Adamant, that knoweth neither sorrow nor rejoicing; 
     then do I abide as a River of Light between the Night of Chaos and the Day 
     of Creation. 
   </li><li>Two are the moons of my madness, like the horns on the head of a goat. And 
     between them burneth a pyramid of flame, which consumeth neither but blindeth 
     both, so that the one beholdeth not the other. Notwithstanding, when the one 
     is lost in the water, and the other is burnt up in the flame, they become 
     united in the form of a woman fashioned of Earth and of Air, who without husband 
     is yet mother of many sons. 
   </li><li>Now the Sons are in truth but one Son; and the one Son but a daughter draped 
     and never naked; for her mother is naked, therefore is she robed. And she 
     is called the Light of my Love, for she is concealed and cannot be seen, as 
     the Sun burneth over her and drowneth her in fire, whilst below her surgeth 
     the sea, whose waves are as flames of water. When thou hast licked up the 
     ocean thou shalt not see her because of the fire; and when thou hast swallowed 
     the Sun surely shall the waters be driven from thee, so that though the fire 
     be thine the water hath slipped thee, as a dog its leash. Yet the path is 
     straight. 
   </li><li>Along it shalt thou journey, and then shalt thou learn that the fear of 
     death is the blood of the world. So the woman dressed herself in the shrouds 
     of the dead, and decked herself with the bones of the fallen; and all feared 
     her, therefore they lived. But she feared life; therefore she wove a dew-moon 
     in her tangled hair as a sign of the fickleness of Death, and wept tears of 
     bitter sorrow that she should live in the blossom of her youth. And her tears 
     crept like scorpions down her cheeks, and sped away in the darkness like serpents; 
     and for each serpent came there an eagle which did carry it away. 
   </li><li>"Why weep?" said the Balance swinging to the left. "Why laugh?" 
     said the Balance swinging to the right. "Why not remain still?" 
     answered the Hand that held the Balance. And the Balance replied: "Because 
     on my right laughs Death and on my left weeps a Virgin." 
   </li><li>Then the voice of the Hand said to the girl: "Why weep?" And the 
     maid answered: "Because Death maketh jest of my life." Then the 
     Hand stayed the Balance, and at once the girl saw that she was Death, and 
     that Death that had sat opposite her was in truth a motherless babe. So she 
     took the child she had conceived in the arms of fear, and went her way laughing. 
   </li><li>And the infant grew strong; yet its strength was in its weakness; and though 
     to look at it from before was to look upon a man-child, from behind it was 
     a little girl with golden hair. Now, when the child wished to tempt a maid 
     he faced and approached her; and when the child wished to tempt a man she 
     turned her back on him and fled. 
   </li><li>But one day the child met, at the self-same hour, Love; and the man, seeing 
     a woman, approached her eagerly, and the woman, seeing a man, fled, so that 
     he might capture her. Thus it came about that the child met the child and 
     wondered, not knowing that the child had lost the child. So it was that they 
     walked side by side. 
   </li><li>Then that part of the child that was man loved and lusted for that part 
     of the child that was woman; and each knew not that each was the other, and 
     felt that they were two and yet one, nevertheless one and yet two. And when 
     one said: "Who art thou?" the other answered at the self-same moment: 
     "Who am I?" 
   </li><li>Soon becoming perplexed if I were Thou, or if Thou were I, it came about 
     that the I mingled with the Thou, and the Thou with the I, so that six added 
     to ten became sixteen, which is felicity; for it is the interplay of the elements. 
     Four are the elements that make man, and four are the elements that make woman. 
     Thus was the child reborn. 
   </li><li>But though the man ruleth the woman, and the woman ruleth the man, the Child 
     ruleth both its mother and father, and being five is Emperor over the kingdom 
     of their hearts. To its father it giveth four, and to its mother it giveth 
     four, yet it remaineth five, for it hath of its father an half and of its 
     mother an half; but in itself it is equal to both its father and its mother; 
     for it is father of fathers and mother of mothers. </li>
 </ol>
 <dl> 
   <dd>0. Therefore is it One Whole, and not two halves; and being One is Thirteen, 
     which is called Nothing when it is All-things. </dd>
