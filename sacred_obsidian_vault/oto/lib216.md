 <h1 align="center" class="title">THE I CHING</h1>
 <h2 align="center" class="heading">A new translation of the<br>
   Book of Changes<br>
   by The Master Therion</h2>
 <br>
 <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
 <p>The Yi King is mathematical and philosophical in form. Its structure is cognate 
   with that of the Qabalah; the actual apparatus is simple, and five minutes is 
   sufficient to obtain a fairly detailed answer to any but the most obscure questions.<br>
   <cite>To Mega Therion</cite></p>
 <h3>THE TAO</h3>
 <p>1. TAO concentrateth itself upon Kether as a point.</p>
 <p>2. TAO directeth itself within Chokmah and becometh the Male Force. He is called 
   YANG, and is symbolized by a Solid Line.</p>
 <p>3. TAO expandeth in Binah and becometh the Female Force. She is called YIN, 
   and is symbolized by a Broken Line.</p>
 <p>4. These three: TAO, YANG and YIN, bring forth heaven and earth, and all contained 
   therein.</p>
 <h3>THE APPARATUS</h3>
 <p>0. TAO is the source of the Yi King, as of all.</p>
 <p>1. Thou shalt obtain 6 Chinese coins. Five shall be of one metal and the sixth 
   of another. One side ye shall call Yang, and the other Yin (Heads and Tails).</p>
 <p>2. These coins should be kept in a wrapped black cloth, and no other should 
   lay his hand upon them. For they swell with thine aura when used with sincerity 
   and repetition.</p>
 <p>3. Hast no coins? Six sticks will serve. Paint one side solid and the other 
   broken. One of the six is especial; It should be made unique by painting one 
   end on both sides. Care for thine sticks as though they were coins.</p>
 <h3>THE METHOD</h3>
 <p>4. When a situation ariseth in thy mind, and you wouldst seek an oracle, do 
   thus: Go and take out thine coins or sticks.</p>
 <p>5. Face thou East; and make clear thy mind, so that no thoughts shall intrude.</p>
 <p>6. Call upon what god ye will; filling thyself with pure light, and raising 
   thine mind to a fixed image of the situation into which you inquire.</p>
 <p>7. Then, gently toss thy sticks or coins toward the East; they wilst fall into 
   a certain pattern which thou wilt arrange into an Hexagram - the unit of Divination 
   of this book: Yi King.</p>
 <h3>THE HEXAGRAM</h3>
 <p>8. An Hexagram is made up of six lines; each line being Yang or Yin. The especial 
   stick or coin is called "The Moving Line."</p>
 <p>9. Each line of the Hexagram is numbered: The line nearest thyself is number 
   One; whilst the farthest away is number Six.</p>
 <h3>AN EXAMPLE</h3>
 <p>10. Thou hast concentrated upon thy situation, and thine sticks have fallen 
   thus:</p>
 <p>Line 6 - YANG (a solid line)<br>
   Line 5 - YANG (a solid line)<br>
   Line 4 - Yang (a solid line)</p>
 <p>Line 3 - YANG (a solid line)<br>
   Line 2 - YIN (a broken line)<br>
   Line 1 - YIN (a broken line)</p>
 <p>( - The moving line is in line 2)</p>
 <p>11. The Hexagram will look like this:</p>
 <pre>
 ----------
 ----------
 ----------
 ----------
 ----  ----
 ----  ----
 </pre>
 <p>12. Take notice that the Hexagram is divided into two Trigrams: An upper Trigram 
   and a lower Trigram.</p>
 <h3>INTERPRETATION</h3>
 <p>13. Taking thine key, which is in this book: thou wilst find the upper Trigram 
   along the top of the squares. Next, find the lower Trigram at the left of the 
   chart.</p>
 <p>14. Follow thee the Trigrams into the center of the Key - Behold the number 
   33.</p>
 <p>15. Then, thou shalt read the Thirty-third Hexagram in this Book: Yi King.</p>
 <p>16. The first two lines refer to the Hexagram as a whole, shewing thee the 
   direction of the matter.</p>
 <p>17. Next, appeareth a six-line poem. The first line of this poem pertaineth 
   to the line number One in the Hexagram. The last line of the poem is for number 
   Six (the one farthest from thy-self).</p>
 <p>18. The Moving Line (in this case number Two) is the specific line which pertains 
   to thy situation: Thine answer from the TAO.</p>
 <p>19. If thou dost not understand, and are bewildered by doubts and questions 
   concerning the Forces of this Divination: Thou mayest read in "Magick" 
   where the Master Therion hath made discourse upon the subject by his understanding 
   of the TAO.</p>
