   APOLOGIA</h2>
 <p>I have begotten thee, o my Son, and that strangely, as thou knowest, upon the 
   Scarlet Woman called Hilarion, as it was mysteriously foretold unto me in <em>The 
   Book of the Law</em>. Now therefore that thou art come to the Age of Understanding, 
   do thou give ear unto my Wisdom, for that therein lieth a simple and direct 
   Way for every Man that he may attain to the End.</p>
 <p>Firstly, then, I would have thee to know that Spiritual Experience and Perfection 
   have no necessary connection with Advancement in our Holy Order. But for each 
   Man is a Path: there is a Constant, and there is a Variable. Seek ever therefore 
   in thy Work of the Promulgation of the Law to discover in each Man his own true 
   Nature, that he may in due Season accomplish it not only for himself, but for 
   all who are bound unto him. There are very many for whom in their present Incarnations 
   this Great Work may be impossible; since their appointed Work may be in Satisfaction 
   of some Magical Debt, or in Adjustment of some Balance, or in Fulfilment of 
   some Defect. As is written: <em>Suum Cuique</em>.</p>
 <p>Now because thou art the Child of my Bowels, I yearn greatly towards thee, 
   o my Son, and I strive strongly with my Spirit that by my Wisdom I may make 
   plain thy Way before thee; and thus in many Chapters will I write for thee those 
   things that may profit thee. <em>Sis benedictus</em>.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{beta}<br>
   DE ARTE KABBALISTICA.</h2>
 <p>Do thou study most constantly, my Son, in the Art of the Holy Qabalah. Know 
   that herein the Relations between Numbers, though they be mighty in Power and 
   prodigal of Knowledge, are but lesser Things. For the Work is to reduce all 
   other conceptions to these of Number, because thus thou wilt lay bare the very 
   Structure of thy Mind, whose rule is Necessity rather than Prejudice. Not until 
   the Universe is thus laid naked before thee canst thou truly anatomize it. The 
   Tendencies of thy Mind lie deeper far than any Thought, for they are the Conditions 
   and the Laws of Thought; and it is these that thou must bring to Nought.</p>
 <p>This Way is most sure; most sacred; and the Enemies thereof most awful, most 
   sublime. It is for the Great Souls to enter on this Rigour and Austerity. To 
   them the Gods themselves do Homage; for it is the Way of Utmost Purity.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{gamma}<br>
   DE VITA CORRIGENDA.</h2>
 <p>Know, son, that the true Principle of Self-Control is Liberty. For we are born 
   into a World which is in Bondage to Ideals; to them we are perforce fitted, 
   even as the Enemies to the Bed of Procrustes. Each of us, as he grows, learns 
   Repression of himself and his true Will. "It is a lie, this folly against 
   self.": these Words are written in <em>The Book of the Law</em>. So therefore 
   these Passions in ourselves which we understand to be Hindrances are not part 
   of our True Will, but diseased Appetites, manifest in us through false early 
   Training. Thus the Tabus of savage Tribes in such matter as Love constrain that 
   True Love which is born in us; and by this Constraint come ills of Body and 
   Mind. Either the Force of Repression carries it, and creates Neuroses and Insanities; 
   or the Revolt against that Force, breaking forth with Violence, involves Excesses 
   and Extravagances. All these Things are Disorders, and against Nature. Now then 
   learn of me the testimony of History and literature as a great Scroll of Learning. 
   But the Vellum of the Scroll is of Man's Skin, and its Ink of his Heart's Blood.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{delta}<br>
   LEGENDA DE AMORE.</h2>
 <p>The Fault, that is Fatality, in Love, as in every other Form of Will, is Impurity. 
   It is not the Spontaneity thereof which worketh Woe, but some Repression in 
   the Environment.</p>
 <p>In the Fable of Adam and Eve is this great Lesson taught by the Masters of 
   the Holy Qabalah. For Love were to them the eternal Eden, save for the Repression 
   signified by the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. Thus their Nature of 
   Love was perfect; it was their Fall from that Innocence which drove them from 
   the Garden.</p>
 <p>In the Love of Romeo and Juliet was no Flaw; but family Feud, which imported 
   nothing to that Love, was its Bane; and the Rashness and Violence of their Revolt 
   against that Repression, slew them.</p>
 <p>In the pure Outrush of Love in Desdemona for Othello was no Flaw; but his Love 
   was marred by his consciousness of his Age and his Race, of the Prejudices of 
   his Fellows and of his own Experience of Woman-Frailty.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{epsilon}<br>
   GESTA DE AMORE.</h2>
 <p>Now as Literature overfloweth with the Murders of Love, so also doeth History, 
   and the Lesson is ever the same.</p>
 <p>Thus the Loves of Abelard and of Heloise were destroyed by the System of Repression 
   in which they chanced to move.</p>
 <p>Thus Beatrice was robbed of Dante by social Artificialities; and Paolo slain 
   on account of Things external to his Love of Francesca.</p>
 <p>Then, <em>per contra</em>, Martin Luther, being a Giant of Will, and also the 
   Eighth Henry of England, as a mighty King, bent them to overturn the whole World 
   that they might have satisfaction of their Loves.</p>
 <p>And who shall follow them? For even now we find great Churchmen, Statesmen, 
   Princes, Dramamakers, and many lesser Men, overwhelmed utterly and ruined by 
   the conflict between their Passions and the Society about them. Wherein which 
   Party errs is no matter of Moment for our Thought; but the Existence of the 
   War is Evidence of Wrong done to Nature.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{digamma}<br>
   ULTIMA THESIS DE AMORE.</h2>
 <p>Therefore, o my Son, be thou wary, not bowing before the false Idols and ideals, 
   yet not flaming forth in Fury against them, unless that be thy Will.</p>
 <p>But in this Matter be prudent and be silent, discerning subtly and with acumen 
   the nature of the Will within thee; so that thou mistake not Fear for Chastity, 
   or Anger for Courage. And since the fetters are old and heavy, and thy Limbs 
   withered and distorted by reason of their Compulsion, do thou, having broken 
   them, walk gently for a little while, until the ancient Elasticity return, so 
   that thou mayst walk, run, and leap naturally and with Rejoicing.</p>
 <p>Also, since these Fetters are as a Bond almost universal, be instant to declare 
   the Law of Liberty, and the full Knowledge of all Truth that appertaineth to 
   this Matter; for if in this only thou overcome, then shall all Earth be free, 
   taking its Pleasure in Sunlight without Fear or Phrenzy. Amen.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{zeta}<br>
   DE NATURA SUA PERCIPIENDA.</h2>
 <p>Understand, o my Son, in thy Youth, these Words which some wise One, now nameless, 
   spake of old; except ye become as little Children ye shall in no wise enter 
   into the Kingdom of Heaven. This is to say that thou must first comprehend thine 
   original Nature in every Point, before thou wast forced to bow before the Gods 
   of Wood and Stone that Men have made, not comprehending the Law of Change, and 
   of Evolution Through Variation, and the independent Value of every living Soul.</p>
 <p>Learn this also, that even the Will to the Great Work may be misunderstood 
   of Men; for this Work must proceed naturally and without Overstress, as all 
   true Works. Right also is that Word that the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth Violence, 
   and the violent take it by Force. But except thou be violent by Virtue of thy 
   true Nature, how shalt thou take it? Be not as the Ass in the Lion's Skin; but 
   if thou be born Ass, bear patiently thy Burdens, and enjoy thy Thistles; for 
   an Ass also, as in the Fables of Apuleius and Matthias, may come to Glory in 
   the Path of his own Virtue.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{eta}<br>
   ALTERA DE VIA NATURAE.</h2>
 <p>Sayest thou (methinks) that here is a great Riddle, since by Reason of much 
   Repression thou hast lost the Knowledge of thine original Nature?</p>
 <p>My son, this is not so; for by a peculiar Ordinance of Heaven, and a Disposition 
   occult within his Mind, is every Man protected from this Loss of his own Soul, 
   until and unless he be by Choronzon disintegrated and dispersed beyond power 
   of Will to repair; as when the Conflict within him, rending and burning, hath 
   made his Mind utterly desert, and his Soul Madness.</p>
 <p>Give Ear, give Ear attentively; the Will is not lost; though it be buried beneath 
   a life-old midden of Repressions, for it persisteth vital within thee (is it 
   not the true Motion of thine inmost Being?) and for all thy conscious Striving 
   cometh forth by Night and by Stealth in Dream and Phantasy. Now is it naked 
   and brilliant, now clothed in rich Robes of Symbol and Hieroglyph; but always 
   travelleth it with thee upon thy Path, ready to acquaint thee with thy true 
   Nature, if thou attend unto its Word, its Gesture, or its Show of Imagery.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{theta}<br>
   QUO MODO NATURA SUA EST LEGENDA.</h2>
 <p>Therefore deem not that thy lightest Fancy is insignificant. Thy most unconscious 
   Acts are Keys to the Treasure-Chamber of thine own Palace, which is the House 
   of the Holy Ghost. Consider well thy conscious Thoughts and Acts, for they are 
   under the Dominion of thy Will, and moved in Accord with the Operation of thy 
   Reason; this indeed is a necessary work, enabling to comprehend in what manner 
   thou mayst adjust thyself to thine Environment. Yet is this Adaptation but Defence 
   for the most Part, or at the best Subterfuge and Stratagem in the Tactics of 
   thy Life, with but an accidental and subordinate Relation to thy true Will, 
   whereof by Consciousness and by Reason thou mayst be ignorant, unless by Fortune 
   great and rare thou be already harmonized in thyself, the Outer with the Inner, 
   which Grace is not common among Men, and is the Reward of previous Attainment.</p>
 <p>Neglect not simple Introspections, therefore; but give yet greater Heed unto 
   those Dreams and Phantasies, those Gestures and Manners unconscious, and of 
   undiscovered Cause, which betoken thee.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{iota}<br>
   DE SOMNIIS.</h2>
 <h3 align="center"><em>a</em>. CAUSA PER ACCIDENS.</h3>
 <p>As all diseases have two conjunct causes, one immediate, external and exciting, 
   the other constitutional, internal, and predisposing, so it is with Dreams, 
   which are Dis-Eases, or unbalanced States of Consciousness, Disturbers of Sleep 
   as Thoughts are of Life.</p>
 <p>This exciting Cause is commonly of two kinds: <em>videlicet, imprimis</em>, 
   the physical Condition of the Sleeper, as a Dream of Water caused by a shower 
   without, or a Dream of Strangulation caused by a Dyspnoea, or a Dream of Lust 
   caused by the seminal Congestions of an unclean Life, or a Dream of falling 
   or flying caused by some unstable Equilibrium of Body.</p>
 <p><em>Secundo</em>, the psychic condition of the Sleeper, the Dream being determined 
   by recent Events in his Life, usually those of the Day previous, and especially 
   such Events as have caused Excitement of Anxiety, the more so if they be unfinished 
   or unfulfilled.</p>
 <p>But this exciting Cause is of a superficial Nature, as it were a Cloke or a 
   Mask; and thus it but lendeth Aspect to the other Cause, which lieth in the 
   Nature of the Sleeper himself.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{kappa}<br>
   DE SOMNIIS.</h2>
 <h3 align="center">{beta}CAUSA PER NATURAM.</h3>
 <p>The deep, constitutional, or predisposing Cause of Dreams lieth within the 
   Jurisdiction of the Will itself. For that Will, being alway present, albeit 
   (it may be) latent, discovereth himself when no longer inhibited by that conscious 
   Control which is determined by Environment, and therefore of times contrary 
   to himself. This being so, the Will declareth himself, as it were in a Pageant, 
   and showeth himself thus apparelled, unto the Sleeper, for a Warning or Admonition. 
   Every Dream, or Pageant of Fancy, is therefore a Shew of Will; and Will being 
   no more prevented by Environment or by Consciousness, cometh as a Conqueror. 
   Yet even so he must come for the most Part throned upon the Chariot of the exciting 
   Cause of the Dream, and therefore is his Appearance symbolic, like a Writing 
   in Cipher, or like a Fable, or like a Riddle in Pictures. But alway does he 
   triumph and fulfil himself therein, for the Dream is a natural Compensation 
   in the inner World for any Failure of Achievement in the outer.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{lambda}<br>
   DE SOMNIIS.</h2>
 <h3 align="center">{gamma}VESTIMENTA HORRORIS.</h3>
 <p>Now then if in a Dream the Will be always triumphant, how cometh it that a 
   Man may be ridden of the Nightmare? And of this the true Explanation is that 
   in such a case the Will is in Danger, having been attacked and wounded or corrupted 
   by the Violence of some Repression. Thus the Consciousness of the Will is directed 
   to the sore Spot, as in Pain, and seeketh comfort in an Externalisation, or 
   shew, of that Antagonism. And because the Will is sacred, such dreams excite 
   an Ecstacy or Phrenzy of Horror, Fear or Disgust. Thus the true Will of Oedipus 
   was toward the bed of Jocasta, but the Tabu, strong both by Inheritance and 
   by Environment, was so attached to that Will that his Dream concerning his Destiny 
   was a Dream of Fear and of Abhorrence, his Fulfilment thereof (even in Ignorance) 
   a spell to stir up all the subconscious Forces of all the People about him, 
   and his Realization of the Act a madness potent to drive him to self-inflicted 
   Blindness and fury-haunted Exile.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{mu}<br>
   DE SOMNIIS.</h2>
 <h3 align="center">{delta}SEQUENTIA.</h3>
 <p>Know firmly, o my son, that the true Will cannot err; for this is thine appointed 
   course in Heaven, in whose order is Perfection.</p>
 <p>A Dream of Horror is therefore the most serious of all Warnings; for it signifieth 
   that thy Will, which is Thy Self in respect of its Motion, is in Affliction 
   and Danger. Thus thou must instantly seek out the Cause of that subconscious 
   Conflict, and destroy thine Enemy utterly by bringing thy conscious Vigour as 
   an Ally to that true Will. If then there be a Traitor in the Consciousness, 
   how much the more is it necessary for thee to arise and extirpate him before 
   he wholly infect thee with the divided Purpose which is the first Breach in 
   that Fortress of the Soul whose Fall should bring it to the shapeless Ruin whose 
   Name is Choronzon!</p>
 <h2 align="center">{nu}<br>
   DE SOMNIIS.</h2>
 <h3 align="center">{epsilon}CLAVICULA.</h3>
 <p>The Dream delightful is then a Pageant of the Fulfilment of the true Will, 
   and the Nightmare a symbolic Battle between it and its Assailants in thyself. 
   But there can be only one true Will, even as there can be only one proper Motion 
   in any Body, no matter of how many Forces that Motion be the Resultant. Seek 
   therefore this Will, and conjoin with it thy conscious Self; for this is that 
   which is written; "Thou hast no right but to do thy Will. Do that, and 
   no other shall say nay." Thou seest, o my Son, that all conscious Opposition 
   to thy Will, whether in Ignorance, or by Obstinacy, or through Fear of others, 
   may in the end endanger even thy true Self, and bring thy Star into Disaster.</p>
 <p>And this is the true Key to Dreams; see that thou be diligent in its Use, and 
   unlock therewith the secret Chambers of thine Heart.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{xi}<br>
   DE VIA PER EMPYRAEUM.</h2>
 <p>Concerning thy Travellings in thy Body of Light, or Astral journeys and Visions 
   so-called, do thou lay this Wisdom to thy Heart, o my Son, that in this Practice, 
   whether Things Seen and Heard be Truth and Reality, or whether they be Phantoms 
   in the Mind, abideth this Supreme Magical Value, namely: Whereas the Direction 
   of such Journeys is consciously willed, and determined by Reason, and also unconsciously 
   willed, by the true Self, since without It no Invocation were possible, we have 
   here a Cooperation of Alliance between the Inner and the Outer Self, and thus 
   an Accomplishment, at least partial, of the Great Work.</p>
 <p>And therefore is Confusion or Terror in any such Practice an Error fearful 
   indeed, bringing about Obsession, which is a temporary or even it may be a permanent 
   Division of the Personality, or Insanity, and therefore a defeat most fatal 
   and pernicious, a Surrender of the Soul to Choronzon.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{omicron}<br>
   DE CULTU.</h2>
 <p>Now, o my Son, that thou mayst be well guarded against thy ghostly Enemies, 
   do thou work constantly by the Means prescribed in our Holy Books.</p>
 <p>Neglect never the fourfold Adorations of the Sun in his four Stations, for 
   thereby thou doest affirm thy Place in Nature and her Harmonies.</p>
 <p>Neglect not the Performance of the Ritual of the Pentagram, and of the Assumption 
   of the Form of Hoor-pa-Kraat.</p>
 <p>Neglect not the daily Miracle of the Mass, either by the Rite of the Gnostic 
   Catholic Church, or that of the Phoenix. Neglect not the Performance of the 
   Mass of the Holy Ghost, as Nature herself prompteth thee.</p>
 <p>Travel also much in the Empyrean in the Body of Light, seeking ever Abodes 
   more fiery and lucid.</p>
 <p>Finally, exercise constantly the Eight Limbs of Yoga. And so shalt thou come 
   to the End.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{pi}<br>
   DE CLAVICULA SOMNIORUM.</h2>
 <p>And now concerning Meditation let me disclose unto thee more fully the Mystery 
   of the Key of Dreams and Phantasies.</p>
 <p>Learn first that as the Thought of the Mind standeth before the Soul and hindereth 
   its Manifestation in consciousness, so also the gross physical Will is the Creator 
   of the Dreams of common Men, and as in Meditation thou doest destroy every Thought 
   by mating it with its Opposite, so must thou cleanse thyself by a full and perfect 
   Satisfaction of that bodily will in the Way of Chastity and Holiness which has 
   been revealed unto thee in thy Initiation.</p>
 <p>This inner Silence of the Body being attained, it may be that the true Will 
   may speak in True Dreams; for it is written that He giveth unto His Beloved 
   in Sleep.</p>
 <p>Prepare thyself therefore in this Way, as a good Knight should do.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{koppa}<br>
   DE SOMNO LUCIDO.</h2>
 <p>Now know this also that at the End of that secret Way lieth a Garden wherein 
   is a Rest House prepared for thee.</p>
 <p>For to him whose physical Needs of whatever Kind are not truly satisfied cometh 
   a Lunar or physical Sleep appointed to refresh and recreate by Cleansing and 
   Repose; but on him that is bodily pure the Lord bestoweth a Solar or Lucid Sleep, 
   wherein move Images of pure Light fashioned by the True Will. And this is called 
   by the Qabalists the Sleep of Shiloam, and of this doeth also Porphyry make 
   mention mention, and Cicero, with many other Wise Men of Old Time.</p>
 <p>Compare, o my Son, with this Doctrine that which was taught thee in the Sanctuary 
   of the Gnosis concerning the Death of the Righteous; and learn moreover that 
   these are but particular Cases of an Universal Formula.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{rho}<br>
   DE VENENIS.</h2>
 <p>My Son, if thou fast awhile, there shall come unto thee a second State of physiological 
   Being, in which is a delight passive and equable, without Will, a contentment 
   of Weakness, with a Feeling of Lightness and of Purity. And this is because 
   the Blood hath absorbed, in its Need of Nutriment, all foreign Elements. Such 
   also is the Case with the Mind which hath not fed itself on Thought. Consider 
   the placid and ruminent Existence of such Persons as read little, are removed 
   from worldy Struggle by some sufficient Property of small and unexciting Value, 
   stably invested, and by Age and Environment are free from Passion. They live, 
   according to their own Nature, without Desire, and they oppose no Resistance 
   to the Operations of Time. Such are called Happy, and in their Way of Vegetable 
   Life it is so; for they are free of any Poison.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{sigma}<br>
   DE MOTU VITAE.</h2>
 <p>Learn then, o my Son, that all Phenomena are the effect of Conflict, even as 
   the Universe itself is a Nothing expressed as the Difference of two Equalities, 
   or, an thou wilt, as the Divorce of Nuit and Hadit. So therefore every Marriage 
   dissolveth a more material, and createth a less material Complex; and this is 
   our Way of Live, rising ever from Ecstasy to Ecstasy. So then all high Violence, 
   that is to say, all Consciousness, is the spiritual Orgasm of a Passion between 
   two lower and grosser Opposites. Thus Light and Heat result from the Marriage 
   of Hydrogen and Oxygen; Love from that of Man and Woman, Dhyana or Ecstasy from 
   that of the Ego and the non-Ego.</p>
 <p>But be thou well grounded in this Thesis corollary, that one or two such Marriages 
   do but destroy for a Time the Exacerbation of any Complex; to deracinate such 
   is a Work of long Habit and deep Search in Darkness for the Germ thereof. But 
   this once accomplished, that particular Complex is destroyed, or sublimated 
   for ever.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{tau}<br>
   DE MORBIS SANGUINIS.</h2>
 <p>Now then understand that all Opposition to the Way of Nature createth Violence. 
   If thine excretory System do its Function not at its fullest, there come Poisons 
   in the Blood, and the Consciousness is modified by the conflicts or Marriages 
   between the elements heterogeneous. Thus if the Liver be not efficient, we have 
   Melancholy; if the Kidneys, Coma; if the Testes or Ovaries, loss of Personality 
   itself. Also, an we poison the Blood directly with Belladonna, we have Delirium 
   vehement and furious; with Hashish, Visions phantastic and enormous; with Anhiolonium, 
   Ecstasy of colour and what not; with diverse Germs of Disease, Disturbances 
   of Consciousness varying with the Nature of the Germ. Also with Ether, we gain 
   the Power of analysing the Consciousness into its Planes; and so for many others.</p>
 <p>But all these are, in our mystical Sense, Poisons; that is, we take two Things 
   diverse and opposite, binding them together so that they are compelled to unite; 
   and the Orgasm of each Marriage is an Ecstasy, the Lower dissolving in the Higher.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{upsilon}<br>
   DE CURSU AMORIS.</h2>
 <p>I continue then, o my son, and reiterate that this Formula is general to all 
   Nature. And thou wilt note that by repeated Marriage cometh Toleration, so the 
   Ecstasy appeareth no more. Thus his half grain of Morphia, which first opened 
   his Gates of Heaven, is nothing worth to the Self-poisoner after a Year of daily 
   Practice. So too the Lover findeth no more Joy in Union with his Mistress, so 
   soon as the original Attraction between them is satisfied by repeated Conjunctions. 
   For this Attraction is an Antagonism; and the greater this Antinomy, the more 
   fierce the Puissance of the Magnetism, and the Quality of Energy disengaged 
   by the Coition.</p>
 <p>Thus in the Union of Similars, as of Halogens with each other, is no strong 
   Passion of explosive Force, and the Love between two Persons of the like Character 
   and Taste is placid and without Transmutation to higher Planes.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{phi}<br>
   DE NUPTIIS MYSTICIS.</h2>
 <p>O my Son, how wonderful is the Wisdom of this Law of Love! How vast are the 
   Oceans of uncharted Joy that lie before the Keel of thy Ship! Yet know this, 
   that every Opposition is in its Nature named Sorrow, and the Joy lieth in the 
   Destruction of the Dyad. Therefore, must thou seek ever those Things which are 
   to thee poisonous, and that in the highest Degree, and make them thine by Love. 
   That which repels, that which disgusts, must thou assimilate in this Way of 
   Wholeness. Yet rest not in the Joy of the Destruction of each complex in thy 
   Nature, but press on to that ultimate Marriage with the Universe whose Consummation 
   shall destroy thee utterly, leaving only that Nothingness which was before the 
   Beginning.</p>
 <p>So then the Life of Non-Action is not for thee; the Withdrawal from Activity 
   is not the Way of the Tao; but rather the Intensification and making universal 
   every Unit of thine Energy on every Plane.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{chi}<br>
   DE VOLUPTATE POENARUM.</h2>
 <p>Go forth, o my Son, o Son of the Sun, rejoicing in thy Strength, as a Warrior, 
   as a Bridegroom, to take thy Pleasure upon the Earth, and in every Palace of 
   the Mind, moving ever from the crass to the subtle, from the coarse to the fine. 
   Conquer every Repulsion in thy self, subdue every Aversion. Assimilate all Poison, 
   for therein only is there Profit. Seek constantly therefore to know what is 
   painful and to cleave thereunto, for by Pain cometh true Pleasure. Those who 
   avoid Pain physical or mental remain little Men, and there is no Virtue in them. 
   Yet be thou ware lest thou fall into the Heresy which maketh Pain, and Self-sacrifice 
   as it were Bribes to corrupt God, to secure some future Pleasure in an imagined 
   After-life. Nay, also of the other Part, fear not to destroy thy Complexes, 
   thinking dreadfully thereby to lose the Power of creating Joy by their Distinction. 
   Yet in each Marriage be thou bold to affirm the spiritual Ardour of the Orgasm, 
   fixing it in some Talisman, whether it be Art, or Magick, or Theurgy.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{psi}<br>
   DE VOLUNTATE ULTIMA.</h2>
 <p>Say not then that this Way is contrary to Nature, and that in Simplicity of 
   Satisfaction of thy Needs is perfection of thy Path. For to thee, who hast aspired, 
   it is thy Nature to perform the Great Work, and this is the final Dissolution 
   of the Cosmos. For though a Stone seem to lie still on a Mountain Top, and have 
   no care, yet hath it an hidden Nature, a Task Ineffable and Stupendous; namely, 
   to force its Way to he Centre of Gravity of the Universe, and also to burn up 
   its Elements into the final Homogeneity of Matter. Therefore the Way of Quiet 
   is but an Illusion of Ignorance. Whoever thou mayst be now, thy Destiny is that 
   which I have declared unto thee; and thou art most fixed in the true Way when, 
   accepting his consciously as thy Will, thou gathereth up thy Powers to move 
   thy Self mightily within it.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{omega}<br>
   DE DIFFERENTIA RERUM.</h2>
 <p>But, o my Son, although thine ultimate Nature be Universal, thine immediate 
   Nature is Particular. Thy Way to the Centre is not oriented as that of any other 
   Being, and thine elements are no kin, but alien, to his. For Shame! Is it not 
   the most transcendent of all the Wisdoms of this Cosmos, that no two Beings 
   are alike? Lo! This is the Secret of all Beauty, and maketh Love not only possible, 
   but necessary, between every Thing and every other Thing. So then, lest thou 
   in thine Ignorance take the false Way, and divigate, must thou learn thine own 
   particular and peculiar Nature in its Relation to all others. For though it 
   be Illusion, it is by the true Analysis of Falsehoods that we are able to destroy 
   them, just as the Physician must understand the Disease of his Patient if he 
   is to choose the fitting Remedy. Now therefore will I make yet more clear unto 
   thee the Value of thy Dreams and Phantesies and Gestures of thine unconscious 
   Body and Mind, as Symptoms of thy particular Will, and show thee how thy mayst 
   come to their Interpretation.</p>
