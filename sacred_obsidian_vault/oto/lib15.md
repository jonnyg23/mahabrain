 <h2><font size="4">I: OF THE FURNISHINGS OF THE TEMPLE</font></h2>
 <p>IN THE EAST, that is, in the direction of Boleskine, which is situated on the 
   South-Eastern shore of Loch Ness in Scotland, two miles east of Foyers, is a 
   shrine or High Altar. Its dimensions should be 7 feet in length, 3 feet in breadth, 
   44 inches in height. It should be covered with a crimson altar-cloth, on which 
   may be embroidered fleur-de-lys in gold, or a sunblaze, or other suitable emblem. 
 </p>
 <p>On each side of it should be a pillar or obelisk, with countercharges in black 
   and white. </p>
 <p>Below it should be the dais of three steps, in black and white squares. </p>
 <p>Above it is the super-altar, at whose toÿ is the Stele of Revealing in reproduction, 
   with four candles on each side of it. Below the stele is a place for The Book 
   of the Law, with six candles on each side of it. Below this again is the Holy 
   Graal, with roses on each side of it. There is room in front of the Cup for 
   the Paten. On each side beyond the roses are two great candles. </p>
 <p>All this is enclosed within a great Veil. </p>
 <p>Forming the apex of an equilateral triangle whose base is a line drawn between 
   the pillars, is a small black square altar, of superimposed cubes. </p>
 <p>Taking this altar as the middle of the base of a similar and equal triangle, 
   at the apex of this second triangle is a small circular font. </p>
 <p>Repeating, the apex of a third triangle is an upright tomb. </p>
 <h2><font size="4">II: OF THE OFFICERS OF THE MASS</font></h2>
 <p>The PRIEST. Bears the Sacred Lance, and is clothed at first in a plain white 
   robe. </p>
 <p>The PRIESTESS. Should be actually Virgo Intacta or specially dedicated to the 
   service of the Great Order. She is clothed in white, blue, and gold. She bears 
   the Sword from a red girdle, and the Paten and Hosts, or Cakes of Light. </p>
 <p>The DEACON. He is clothed in white and yellow. He bears The Book of the Law. 
 </p>
 <p>Two CHILDREN. They are clothed in white and black. One bears a pitcher of water 
   and a cellar of salt, the other a censer of fire and a casket of perfume. </p>
 <h2><font size="4">III: OF THE CEREMONY OF THE INTROIT</font></h2>
 <p>The DEACON, opening the door of the Temple, admits the congregation and takes 
   his stand between the small altar and the font. (There should be a doorkeeper 
   to attend to the admission.) The DEACON advances and bows before the open shrine 
   where the Graal is exalted. He kisses The Book of the Law three times, opens 
   it, and places it upon the super-altar. He turns West. </p>
 <p><strong>The DEACON: Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law. I proclaim 
   the Law of Light, Life, Love, and Liberty in the name of IAQ.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>The CONGREGATION: Love is the law, love under will.</strong> </p>
 <p>The DEACON goes to his place between the altar of incense and the font, faces 
   East, and gives the step and sign of a Man and a Brother. All imitate him. </p>
 <p><strong>The DEACON and all the PE_PLE:</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>I believe in one secret and ineffable LORD; and in one Star in the 
   Company of Stars of whose fire we are created, and to which we shall return; 
   and in one Father of Life, Mystery of Mystery, in His name CHAOS, the sole viceregent 
   of the Sun upon the Earth; and in one Air the nourisher of all that breathes.</strong> 
 </p>
 <p><strong>And I believe in one Earth, the Mother of us all, and in one Womb wherein 
   all men are begotten, and wherein they shall rest, Mystery of Mystery, in Her 
   name BABALON.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>And I believe in the Serpent and the Lion, Mystery of Mystery, in His 
   name BAPHOMET.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>And I believe in one Gnostic and Catholic Church of Light, Life, Love 
   and Liberty, the Word of whose Law is THELEMA.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>And I believe in the communion of Saints.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>And, forasmuch as meat and drink are transmuted in us daily into spiritual 
   substance, I believe in the Miracle of the Mass.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>And I confess one Baptism of Wisdom whereby we accomplish the Miracle 
   of Incarnation.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>And I confess my life one, individual, and eternal that was, and is, 
   and is to come.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>AUMGN. AUMGN. AUMGN.</strong> </p>
 <p>Music is now played. The child enters with the ewer and the salt. The VIRGIN 
   enters with the Sword and the Paten. The child enters with the censer and the 
   perfume. They face the DEACON, deploying into line, from the space between the 
   two altars. </p>
 <p><strong>The VIRGIN: Greeting of Earth and Heaven!</strong> </p>
 <p>All give the Hailing sign of a Magician, the DEACON leading. </p>
 <p>The PRIESTESS, the negative child on her left, the positive child on her right, 
   ascends the steps of the High Altar. They await her below. She places the Paten 
   before the Graal. Having adored it, she descends, and with the children following 
   her, the positive next her, she moves in a serpentine manner involving 3 circles 
   of the Temple. (Deosil about altar, widdershins about font, deosil about altar 
   and font, widdershins about altar, and so to the Tomb in the West.) She draws 
   her Sword and pulls down the Veil therewith. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIESTESS: By the power of Iron, I say unto thee, Arise. In the 
   name of our Lord the Sun, and of our Lord ... that thou mayst administer the 
   virtues to the Brethren.</strong> </p>
 <p>She sheathes the Sword. </p>
 <p>The PRIEST, issuing from the Tomb, holding the Lance erect with both hands, 
   right over left, against his breast, takes the first three regular steps. He 
   then gives the Lance to the PRIESTESS, and gives the three penal signs. He then 
   kneels and worships the Lance with both hands. Penitential music. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: I am a man among men.</strong> </p>
 <p>He takes again the Lance, and lowers it. He rises. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: How should I be worthy to administer the virtues to the 
   Brethren?</strong> </p>
 <p>The PRIESTESS takes from the child the water and the salt, and mixes them in 
   the font. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIESTESS: Let the salt of Earth admonish the water to bear the 
   virtue of the Great Sea. (Genuflects.) Mother, be thou adored.</strong> </p>
 <p>She returns to the West. on PRIEST with open hand doth she make, over his forehead, 
   breast, and body. </p>
 <p><strong>Be the PRIEST pure of body and soul!</strong> </p>
 <p>The PRIESTESS takes the censer from the child, and places it on the small altar. 
   She puts incense therein. </p>
 <p><strong>Let the Fire and the Air make sweet the world! (Genuflects.)</strong> 
 </p>
 <p><strong>Father, be thou adored.</strong> </p>
 <p>She returns West, and makes with the censer before the PRIEST, thrice as before. 
 </p>
 <p><strong>Be the PRIEST fervent of body and soul!</strong> </p>
 <p>(The children resume their weapons as they are done with.) </p>
 <p>The DEACON now takes the consecrated Robe from High Altar, and brings it to 
   her. She robes the PRIEST in his Robe of scarlet and gold. </p>
 <p><strong>Be the flame of the Sun thine ambience, O thou PRIEST of the SUN!</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>The DEACON brings the crown from the High Altar. (The crown may be of gold 
   or platinum, or of electrum magicum; but with no other metals, save the small 
   proportions necessary to a proper alloy. It may be adorned with divers jewels, 
   at will But it must have the Uræus serpent twined about it, and the cap of maintenance 
   must match the scarlet of the Robe. Its texture should be velvet.) </p>
 <p><strong>Be the Serpent thy crown, O thou PRIEST of the LORD!</strong> </p>
 <p>Kneeling, she takes the Lance, between her open hands, and runs them up and 
   down upon the shaft eleven times, very gently. </p>
 <p><strong>Be the LORD present among us!</strong> </p>
 <p>All give the Hailing Sign. </p>
 <p><strong>The PEOPLE: So mote it be.</strong></p>
 <h2><font size="4">IV: OF THE CEREMONY OF THE OPENING OF THE VEIL</font></h2>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: Thee therefore whom we adore we also invoke. By the power 
   of the lifted Lance!</strong> </p>
 <p>He raises the Lance. All repeat Hailing Sign. A phrase of triumphant music. 
   The PRIEST takes the PRIESTESS by her right hand with his left, keeping the 
   Lance raised. </p>
 <p><strong>I, PRIEST and KING, take thee, Virgin pure without spot; I upraise 
   thee; I lead thee to the East; I set thee upon the summit of the Earth.</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>He thrones the PRIESTESS upon the altar. The DEACON and the children follow, 
   they in rank, behind him. The PRIESTESS takes The Book of the Law, resumes her 
   seat, and holds it &amp;127;pen on her breast with her two hands, making a descending 
   triangle with thumbs and forefingers. The PRIEST gives the lance to the DEACON 
   to hold, and takes the ewer from the child, and sprinkles the PRIESTESS, making 
   five crosses, forehead, shoulders, and thighs. The thumb of the PRIEST is always 
   between his index and medius, whenever he is not holding the Lance. The PRIEST 
   takes the censer from the child, and makes five crosses, as before. The children 
   replace their weapons on their respective altars. The PRIEST kisses The Book 
   of the Law three times. He kneels for a space in adoration, with joined hands, 
   knuckles closed, thumb in position aforesaid. He rises, and draws the veil over 
   the whole altar. All rise and stand to order. The PRIEST takes the lance from 
   the DEACON, and holds it as before, as Osiris or Pthah. He circumambulates the 
   Temple three times, followed by the DEACON and the children as before. (These, 
   when not using their hands, keep their arms crossed upon their breasts.) At 
   the last circumambulation they leave him, and go to the place between the font 
   and the small altar, where they kneel in adoration, their hands joined palm 
   to palm, and raised above their heads. All imitate this motion. The PRIEST returns 
   to the East, and mounts the first step of the altar. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST:</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>O circle of Stars whereof our Father is but the younger brother, marvel 
   beyond imagination, soul of infinite space, before whom Time is Ashamed, the 
   mind bewildered, and the understanding dark, not unto Thee may we attain, unless 
   Thine image be Love. Therefore by seed and root and stem and bud and leaf and 
   flower and fruit do we invoke Thee.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>Then the priest answered &amp; said unto the Queen of Space, kissing 
   her lovely brows, and the dew of her light bathing his whole body in a sweet-smelling 
   perfume of sweat; O Nuit, continuous one of Heaven, let it be ever thus; that 
   men speak not of thee as One but as None; and let them speak not of thee at 
   all, since thou art continuous.</strong> </p>
 <p>During this speech the PRIESTESS must have divested herself completely of her 
   robe. See CCXX I:62. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIESTESS:</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>But to love me is better than all things; if under the night-stars 
   in the desert thou presently burnest mine incense before me, invoking me with 
   a pure heart, and the serpent flame therein, thou shalt come a little to lie 
   in my bosom. For one kiss wilt thou then be willing to give all; but whoso gives 
   one particle of dust shall lose all in that hour. Ye shall gather goods and 
   store of women and spices; ye shall wear rich jewels; ye shall exceed the nations 
   of the earth in splendour and pride; but always in the love of me, and so shall 
   ye come to my joy. I charge you earnestly to come before me in a single robe, 
   and covered with a rich head-dress. I love you! I yearn to you! Pale or purple, 
   veiled or voluptuous, I who am all pleasure and purple, and drunkenness of the 
   innermost sense, desire you. Put on the wings, and arouse the coiled splendour 
   within you: come unto me! To me! To me! Sing the raptuous love-song unto me! 
   Burn to me perfumes! Wear to me jewels! Drink to me, for I love you! I love 
   you. I am the blue-lidded daughter of sunset; I am the naked brilliance of the 
   voluptuous night-sky. To me! To me!</strong> </p>
 <p>The PRIEST mounts the second step. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST:</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>O secret of secrets that art hidden in the being of all that lives, 
   not Thee do we adore, for that which adoreth is also Thou. Thou art That, and 
   That am I.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>I am the flame that burns in every heart of man, and in the core of 
   every star. I am Life, and the giver of Life; yet therefore is the knowledge 
   of me the knowledge of death. I am alone; there is no God where I am.</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>The DEACON and all rise to their feet, with the Hailing sign. </p>
 <p><strong>The DEACON: </strong></p>
 <p><strong>But ye, O my people rise up and awake.<br>
   Let the rituals be rightly performed with joy and beauty.<br>
   There are rituals of the elements and feasts of the times.<br>
   A feast for the first night of the Prophet and his Bride.<br>
   A feast for the three days of the writing of the Book of the Law. <br>
   A feast for Tahuti and the children of the Prophet-secret, O Prophet! <br>
   A feast for the Supreme Ritual, and a feast for the Equinox of the Gods.<br>
   A feast for fire and a feast for water; a feast for life and a greater feast 
   for death.<br>
   A feast every day in your hearts in the joy of my rapture.<br>
   A feast every night unto Nu, and the pleasure of uttermost delight.</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>The PRIEST mounts the third step. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST:</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>Thou that art One, our Lord in the Universe the Sun, our Lord in ourselves 
   whose name is Mystery of Mystery, uttermost being whose radiance enlightening 
   the worlds is also the breath that maketh every God even and Death to tremble 
   before Thee - By the Sign of Light appear Thou glorious upon the throne of the 
   Sun.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>Make open the path of creation and of intelligence between us and our 
   minds. Enlighten our understanding. Encourage our hearts. Let thy light crystallize 
   itself in our blood, fulfilling us of Resurrection.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>A ka dua<br>
   Tuf ur biu<br>
   bi a'a chefu<br>
   Dudu nur af an nuteru.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIESTESS: There is no law beyond Do what thou wilt.</strong> </p>
 <p>The PRIEST parts the veil with his lance. During the previous speeches the 
   PRIESTESS has, if necessary, as in savage countries, resumed her robe. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST:</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>IO IO IO IAO SABAO<br>
   KURIE ABRASAX KURIE MEITHRAS KURIE PHALLE.<br>
   IO PAN, IO PAN PAN IO ISXURON, IO ATHANATON IO ABROTON IO IAO. XAIRE PHALLE 
   KAIRE PANPHAGE KAIRE PANGENETOR.<br>
   HAGIOS, HAGIOS, HAGIOS IAO.</strong> </p>
 <p>The PRIESTESS is seated with the Paten in her right hand and the cup in her 
   left. The PRIEST presents the Lance, which she kisses eleven times. She then 
   holds it to her breast, while the PRIEST, falling at her knees, kisses them, 
   his arms stretched along her thighs. He remains in this adoration while the 
   DEACON intones the Collects. All stand to order, with the Dieu Garde, that is, 
   feet square, hands, with linked thumbs, held loosely. This is the universal 
   position when standing, unless other direction is given.</p>
 <h2><font size="4">V: OF THE OFFICE OF THE COLLECTS WHICH ARE ELEVEN IN NUMBER 
   </font></h2>
 <h3>The Sun</h3>
 <p><strong>The DEACON: Lord visible and sensible of whom this earth is but a frozen

 <h2><font size="4">VI: OF THE CONSECRATION OF THE ELEMENTS</font></h2>
 <p>The PRIEST makes the five crosses. 3 12 on paten and cup; 4 on paten alone; 
   5 on cup alone. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: Life of man upon earth, fruit of labour, sustenance of

 <p>He makes the five crosses on the PRIESTESS. </p>
 <p><strong>Accept, O LORD, this sacrifice of life and joy, true warrants of the 
   Covenant of Resurrection.</strong> </p>
 <p>The PRIEST offers the Lance to the PRIESTESS, who kisses it; he then touches 
   her between the breasts and upon the body. He then flings out his arms upward, 
   as comprehending the whole shrine. </p>
 <p><strong>Let this offering be borne upon the waves of Aethyr to our Lord and 
   Father the Sun that travelleth over the Heavens in his name ON.</strong> </p>
 <p>He closes his hands, kisses the PRIESTESS between the breasts, and makes three 
   great crosses over the Paten, the Cup, and himself. He strikes his breast. All 
   repeat this action. </p>
 <p><strong>Hear ye all, saints of the true church of old time now essentially 
   present, that of ye we claim heirship, with ye we claim communion, from ye we

 <h2><font size="4">VIII: OF THE MYSTIC MARRIAGE AND CONSUMMATION OF THE ELEMENTS 
   </font></h2>
 <p>The PRIEST takes the Paten between the index and medius of the right hand. 
   The PRIESTESS clasps the Cup in her right hand. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: Lord most secret, bless this spiritual food unto our bodies, 
   bestowing upon us health and wealth and strength and joy and peace, and that 
   fulfilment of will and of love under will that is perpetual happiness.</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>He makes with Paten and kisses it. He uncovers the Cup, genuflects, rises. 
   Music. He takes the Host, and breaks it over the Cup. He replaces the right-hand 
   portion in the Paten. He breaks off a particle of the left-hand portion. </p>
 <p><strong>TOUTO ESTI TO SPERMA MOU. O PATHR ESTIN O HUIOS DIA TO PNEUMA 'AGION. 
   AUMGN. AUMGN. AUMGN.</strong> </p>
 <p>He replaces the left-hand part of the Host. The PRIESTESS extends the Lance-point 
   with her left hand to receive the particle. The PRIEST clasps the Cup in his 
   left hand. Together they depress the Lance-point in the Cup. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST and the PRIESTESS: HRILIU.</strong> </p>
 <p>The PRIEST takes the Lance. The PRIESTESS covers the Cup. The PRIEST genuflects, 
   rises, bows, joins hands. He strikes his breast. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: </strong></p>
 <p><strong>O Lion and O Serpent that destroy the destroyer, be mighty among us.<br>
   O Lion and O Serpent that destroy the destroyer, be mighty among us.<br>
   O Lion and O Serpent that destroy the destroyer, be mighty among us.</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>The PRIEST joins hands upon the breast of the PRIESTESS, and takes back his 
   Lance. He turns to the Peoÿle, lowers and raises the Lance, and makes upon them. 
 </p>
 <p><strong>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>The PEOPLE: Love is the law, love under will.</strong> </p>
 <p>He lowers the Lance, and turns to East. The PRIESTESS takes the Lance in her 
   right hand. With her left hand she offers the Paten. The PRIEST kneels. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: In my mouth be the essence of the life of the Sun!</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>He takes the Host with the right hand, makes with it on the Paten, and consumes 
   it. Silence. The PRIESTESS takes, uncovers, and offers the Cup, as before. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: In my mouth be the essence of the joy of the earth!</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>He takes the Cup, makes on the PRIESTESS, drains it and returns it. </p>
 <p>Silence. He rises, takes the Lance, and turns to the PEOPLE. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST: There is no part of me that is not of the Gods.</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>(Those of the PEOPLE who intend to communicate, and none other should be present, 
   having signified their intention, a whole Cake of Light, and a whole goblet 
   of wine, have been prepared for each one. The DEACON marshals them; they advance 
   one by one to the altar. The children take the Elements and offer them. The 
   PEOPLE communicate as did the PRIEST, uttering the same words in an attitude 
   of Resurrection: "There is no part of me that is not of the Gods.'' The 
   exceptions to this part of the ceremony are when it is of the nature of a celebration, 
   in which case none but the PRIEST communicate; or part of the ceremony of marriage, 
   when none other, save the two to be married, partake; part of the ceremony of 
   baptism, when only the child baptised partakes; and of Confirmation at puberty, 
   when only the persons confirmed partake. The Sacrament may be reserved by the 
   PRIEST, for administration to the sick in their homes. </p>
 <p>The PRIEST closes all within the veil. With the Lance he makes crosses on the 
   people thrice, thus. </p>
 <p><strong>The PRIEST:</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>The LORD bless you.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>The LORD enlighten your minds and comfort your hearts and sustain your 
   bodies.</strong> </p>
 <p><strong>The LORD bring you to the accomplishment of your true Wills, the Great 
   Work, the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness.</strong> </p>
 <p>He goes out, the DEACON and children following, into the Tomb of the West.
