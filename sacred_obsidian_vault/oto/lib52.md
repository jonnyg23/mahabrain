 <h1 align="center">Manifesto of the O.T.O.</h1>
 <h2 align="center">Issued by Order:</h2>
 <h2 align="center">BAPHOMET XIÂ° O.T.O.,<br>
   HIBERNIAE IONAE ET OMNIUM BRITANNIARUM,<br>
   REX SUMMUS SANCTISSIMUS</h2>
 <p align="center">Peace, Tolerance, Truth; <br>
   Salutation on All Points of the Triangle; <br>
   Respect To the Order. </p>
 <p align="center">To All Whom It May Concern: Greeting and Health.</p>
 <p align="center"><strong>Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law.</strong> 
 </p>
 <p>1. The O.T.O. is a body of initiates in whose hands are concentrated the wisdom 
   and the knowledge of the following bodies:<br>
 </p>
 <ol type="1" start="1">
   <li>The Gnostic Catholic Church. </li>
   <li>The Order of the Knights of the Holy Ghost. </li>
   <li>The Order of the Illuminati. </li>
   <li>The Order of the Temple (Knights Templar). </li>
   <li>The Order of the Knights of St. John. </li>
   <li>The Order of the Knights of Malta. </li>
   <li>The Order of the Knights of the Holy Sepulchre. </li>
   <li>The Hidden Church of the Holy Graal. </li>
   <li>The Hermetic Brotherhood of Light. </li>
   <li>The Holy Order of Rose Croix of Heredom. </li>
   <li type="1">The Order of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch. </li>
   <li>The Antient and Primitive Rite of Masonry (33 degrees). </li>
   <li>The Rite of Memphis (97 degrees). </li>
   <li>The Rite of Mizraim (90 degrees). </li>
   <li>The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Masonry (33 degrees). </li>
   <li>The Swedenborgian Rite of Masonry. </li>
   <li>The Order of the Martinists. </li>
   <li>The Order of the Sat Bhai, and many other orders of equal merit, if of less 
     fame. </li>
 </ol>
 <p>It does not include the A.Â·.A.Â·., with which august body it is, however, in 
   close alliance.</p>
 <p>It does not in any way infringe the just privileges of duly authorized Masonic 
   Bodies.</p>
 <p>2. The dispersion of the original secret wisdom having led to confusion, it 
   was determined by the Chiefs of all these Orders to recombine and centralize 
   their activities, even as white light, divided in a prism, may be recomposed.</p>
 <p>It embodies the whole of the secret knowledge of all Oriental Orders; and its 
   chiefs are initiates of the highest rank, and recognized as such by all capable 
   of such recognition in every country in the world.</p>
 <p>In more remote times, the constituent originating assemblies of the O.T.O. 
   included such men as:</p>

 <p>The names of women members are never divulged.</p>
 <p>It is not lawful here to disclose the name of any living chief.</p>
 <p>It was Karl Kellner who revived the exoteric organization of the O.T.O. and 
   initiated the plan now happily complete of bringing all occult bodies again 
   under one governance.</p>
 <p>The letters O.T.O. represent the words Ordo Templi Orientis (Order of the Temple 
   of the Orient, or Oriental Templars), but they have also a secret meaning for 
   initiates.</p>
 <p>3. The Order is international, and has existing branches in every civilized 
   country of the world.</p>
 <p>4. The aims of the O.T.O. can only be understood fully by its highest initiates; 
   but it may be said openly that it teaches Hermetic Science or Occult Knowledge, 
   the Pure and Holy Magick of Light, the Secrets of Mystic attainment, Yoga of 
   all forms, Gnana Yoga, Raja Yoga, Bhakta Yoga and Hatha Yoga, and all other 
   branches of the secret Wisdom of the Ancients.</p>
 <p>In its bosom repose the Great Mysteries; its brain has resolved all the problems 
   of philosophy and of life.</p>
 <p>It possesses the secret of the Stone of the Wise, of the Elixir of Immortality, 
   and of the Universal Medicine.</p>
 <p>Moreover, it possesses a Secret capable of realizing the world-old dream of 
   the Brotherhood of Man.</p>
 <p>It also possesses in every important centre of poÃ¿ulation a hidden Retreat 
   (<em>Collegium ad Spiritum Sanctum</em>) where members may conceal themselves 
   in order to pursue the Great Work without hindrance.</p>
 <p>These houses are secret fortresses of Truth, Light, Power and Love, and their 
   position is only disclosed under an oath of secrecy to those entitled to make 
   use of them.</p>
 <p>They are also temples of true worship, specially consecrated by Nature to bring 
   out of a man all that is best in him.</p>
 <p>5. The authority of the O.T.O. is concentrated in the O.H.O. (Outer Head of 
   the Order), or Frater Superior. The name of the person occupying this office 
   is never disclosed except to his immediate representatives.</p>
 <p>6. The Authority of the O.H.O. in all English-speaking countries is delegated 
   by charter to the Most Holy, Most Illustrious, Most Illuminated, and Most Puissant 
   Baphomet XÂ° Rex Summus Sanctissimus 33Â°, 90Â°, 96Â°, Past Grand Master of the 
   United States of America, Grand Master of Ireland, Iona, and All the Britains, 
   Grand Master of the Knights of the Holy Ghost, Sovereign Grand Commander of 
   the Order of the Temple, Most Wise Sovereign of the Order of the Rosy Cross, 
   Grand Zerubbabel of the Order of the Holy Royal Arch of Enoch, etc. etc. etc., 
   National Grand Master General <em>ad vitam</em> of the O.T.O.</p>
 <p>7. The National Grand Master General <em>ad vitam</em> is assisted by two principal 
   officers, the Grand Treasurer General and the Grand Secretary General.</p>
 <p>There are many other officers, but they do not concern those to whom the present 
   manifesto is addressed.</p>
 <p>8. The whole of the Knowledge dispersed among the bodies mentioned in paragraph 
   2 has been sifted and concentrated in the following degrees. </p>

 <p>9. Every man and woman that is of full age, free, and of good report, has an 
   indefeasible right to the IIIÂ°.</p>
 <p>Beyond this, admission is only granted by invitation from the governing body 
   concerned.</p>
 <p>The O.T.O., although an Academia Masonica, is not a Masonic Body so far as 
   the 'secrets' are concerned in the sense in which that expression is usually 
   understood; and therefore in no way conflicts with, or infringes the just privileges 
   of, the United Grand Lodge of England, or any Grand Lodge in America or elsewhere 
   which is recognized by it.</p>
 <p>10. Application for admission to the Order may be made personally at headquarters, 
   between the hours of Ten A.M. and Twelve Noon on week-days, or by letter to 
   the Grand Secretary General. In the former case, applicants should be provided 
   with the Twenty Dollars entitling them to the Third Degree; in the latter, it 
   should be enclosed with the application.</p>
 <p>The First Annual Subscription is payable on taking the Third Degree; if this 
   is taken after June 30 in any year, only half the amount is due.</p>
 <p>Subscriptions of old members are due on January 1, but the Brother is considered 
   in good standing, and he does not lose his rights, if it is paid by March 1. 
   Should he fail to discharge his obligation by this date, he ceases <em>ipso 
   facto</em> to be a member of the Order, but may be reinstated on paying arrears 
   and Five Dollars extra. If his lapse extend to the next year following, he can 
   only be reinstated under special conditions, and by the express consent in writing 
   of the National Grand Master General <em>ad vitam</em>.</p>
 <p>11. The Constitution, Trust Deeds, Charters, Warrants and all other documents, 
   are exhibited to candidates on their exaltation to the IVÂ°, should they desire 
   it.</p>
 <p>12. Besides the free certificate of membership, special diplomas for framing 
   are granted to all members at a uniform price of Ten Dollars. Special diplomas 
   of the IXÂ°, Twenty-five Dollars.</p>
 <p>13. The privileges of members of the O.T.O. are very numerous. These are the 
   principal: </p>
 <ol type="1" start="1">
   <li>They have not only access to, but instruction in, the whole body of hidden 
     knowledge preserved in the Sanctuary from the beginning of its manifestation.
     <p>In the lower grades the final secrets are hinted and conveyed in symbol, 
       beneath veil, and through sacrament.</p>
     <p>In this way the intelligence of the initiate is called into play, so that 
       he who well uses the knowledge of the lower grades may be selected for invitation 
       to the higher, where all things are declared openly.</p>
   </li>
   <li>They become partakers of the current of Universal Life in Liberty, Beauty, 
     Harmony, and Love which flames within the heart of the O.T.O., and the Light 
     of that august fraternity insensibly illuminates them ever more and more as 
     they approach its central Sun.</li>
   <li>They meet those persons most complemental to their own natures, and find 
     unexpected help and brotherhood in the whole world wherever they may travel.</li>
   <li>They obtain the right to sojourn in the secret houses of the O.T.O., permanently 
     or for a greater or lesser period of the year according to their rank in the 
     Order; or, in the case of those of the Fifth and lower degrees, are candidates 
     for invitation to these houses.</li>
   <li>The Knowledge of the Preparation and Use of the Universal Medicine is restricted 
     to members of the IXÂ°; but it may be administered to members of the VIIIÂ° 
     and VIIÂ° in special circumstances by favour of the National Grand Masters 
     General, and even in particular emergency to members of lower degrees.</li>
   <li>In the VÂ° all members are pledged to bring immediate and perfect relief 
     to all distress of mind, body, or estate, in which they may find any of their 
     fellows of that degree. In the higher degrees the Bonds of Fraternity are 
     still further strengthened. The Order thus affords a perfect system of insurance 
     against every misfortune or accident of life.</li>
   <li>Members of the IXÂ° become part proprietors of the Estates and Goods of the 
     Order, so that the attainment of this degree implies a return with interest 
     of the fees and subscriptions paid.</li>
   <li>The Order gives practical assistance in life to worthy members of even its 
     lower degrees, so that, even if originally poor, they become well able to 
     afford the comparatively high fees of the VIIÂ°, VIIIÂ°, and IXÂ°. On exaltation 
     to the IVÂ° each Companion may file an account of his circumstances, and state 
     in what direction he requires help. </li>
 </ol>
 <p>14. In selecting members for advancement, attention is paid to their devotion 
   to the Order, to their intelligence in apprehending the nature of its teaching, 
   to their zeal in spreading the principles of the Order so far as they themselves 
   understand them, though always with the discretion inseparable from the due 
   guarding of the secrets, and to all those qualities of courage, honour, and 
   virtue without which man is not worthy of that name.</p>
 <p>15. The O.H.O. is only known to members of the VIIIÂ° and IXÂ°.</p>
 <p>The National Grand Master General ad vitam is not approachable as such by any 
   person who has not reached the VIÂ°.</p>
 <p>All communications should be addressed to the Grand Secretary General, and 
   all cheques drawn in favour of the Grand Treasurer General.</p>
