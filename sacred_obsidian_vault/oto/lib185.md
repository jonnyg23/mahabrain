                         Being the Tasks of the Grades,  
                                and their Oaths,  
                              proper to Liber XIII,

                                    A.'. A.'. 
                             in Class D from A to G.
 
 
 
      This  paper  is  to  be returned to the  A.'.  A.'.  by  the  Neophyte 
     introducing through his Zelator.
 
                        A.'. A.'. Publication in Class D. 
 
                                        A.
 
                            THE TASK OF A PROBATIONER.
 
     0.  Let  any  person  be  received by  a  Neophyte,  the  latter  being 
     responsible to his Zelator.
 
     1. The period of Probation shall be at least one year.
 
     2. The aspirant to the A.'. A.'. shall hear the Lection (Liber LXI) and 
     this note of his office;  IF HE WILL,  shall then procure the robe of a 
     Probationer; shall choose with deep forethought and intense solemnity a 
     motto.
 
     3.  On reception, he shall receive the robe, sign the form provided and 
     repeat the oath appointed, and receive the First Volume of the Book.
 
     4.  He shall commit a chapter of Liber LXV to memory;  and furthermore, 
     he shall study the Publications of the A.'.  A.'. in Class B, and apply 
     himself to such practices of Scientific Illuminism as seemeth him good.
 
     5.  Beside all this,  he shall perform any tasks that the A.'. A.'. may 
     see fit to lay upon him.  Let him be mindful that the word  Probationer 
     is  no  idle  term,  but that the Brothers will in many  a  subtle  way 
     'prove' him, when he knoweth it not.
 
     6.  When  the  sun shall next enter the sign under which he  hath  been 
     received, his initiation may be granted unto him. He shall keep himself 
     free from all other engagements for one whole week from that date.
 
     7.  He  may  at any moment withdraw from his association with the  
     A.'. A.'., simply notifying the Neophyte who introduced him.
 
     8.  He  shall  everywhere  proclaim  openly  his  connection  with  the  
     A.'.  A.'.  and  speak of It and Its principles (even so little  as  he 
     understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of Truth.
 
     One month before the completion of his year, he shall deliver a copy of 
     the  Record of his year's work to the Neophyte introducing,  and repeat 
     to him his chosen chapter of Liber LXV.
 
     9. He shall hold himself chaste, and reverent toward his body, for that 
     the  ordeal  of  initiation  is no  light  one.  This  is  of  peculiar 
     importance in last two months of his Probation.
 
     10.  Thus and not otherwise may he attain the great reward: YEA, MAY HE 
     OBTAIN THE GREAT REWARD!

     0.   Let  any  Probationer  who  has  accomplished  his  task  to   the 
     satisfaction  of the A.'.  A.'.  be instructed in the proper course  of 
     procedure:  which is:  -- Let him read through this note of his office, 
     and  sign it,  paying the sum of One Guinea for Liber VII which will be 
     given him on his initiation, and One Guinea for this Portfolio of Class 
     D  publications,  B - G.  Let him obtain the robe of  a  Neophyte,  and 
     entrust the same to the care of his Neophyte.
 
     He  shall  choose  a  new  motto  with  deep  forethought  and  intense 
     solemnity,  as  expressing the clearer consciousness of his  Aspiration 
     which the year's Probation has given him.
 
     Let  him  make an appointment with his Neophyte at the pleasure of  the 
     the latter for the ceremony of Initiation.

     in the Spirit Vision.
 
     5.  Beside all this, he shall perform any tasks that his Zelator in the 
     name of the A.'. A.'. and by its authority may see fit to lay upon him. 
     Let him be mindful that the word Neophyte is no idle term,  but that in 
     many a subtle way the new nature will stir within him,  when he knoweth 
     it not.
 
     6.  When the sun shall next enter the sigh 240 (degrees) to that  under 
     which  he hath been received,  his advancement may be granted unto him. 
     He  shall keep himself free from all other engagements for  four  whole

     Furthermore,  he shall construct the magic Pentacle,  according to  the 
     instruction in Liber A.
 
     One month before the completion of his eight months, he shall deliver a 
     copy of his Record to his Zelator, pass the necessary tests, and repeat

     This paper is to be returned to the Chancellor of the A.'. A.'. through

                             THE TASK OF A ZELATOR.
 
     0.  Let  any Neophyte who has accomplished his task to the satisfaction 
     of the A.'. A.'. be instructed in the proper course of procedure: which 
     is:--
 
     Let him read through this note of his office,  and sign it,  paying the 
     sum of Three Guineas for the volume containing Liber CCXX,  Liber XXVII 
     and Liber DCCCXIII, which will be given him on his initiation.
 
     Let him cause the necessary addition to be make to his Neophyte's robe, 
     and entrust the same to the care of his Zelator.
 
     Let  him  make an appointment with his Zelator at the pleasure  of  the 
     latter for the ceremony of initiation.
 
     1. The Zelator shall proceed to that grade of Practicus at any time the 
     authority confers it.
 
     2.  He shall pass Examinations in Liber E,  Posture and  Breathing.  He 
     shall  have attained complete success in the former,  i.e.,  the chosen 
     posture  shall be perfectly steady and easy;  and attained  the  second 
     stage in the latter, i.e., automatic rigidity.
 
     3.  He  shall  further  show some acquaintance with and  experience  of 
     meditations  given in Liber HHH.  And in this his Record shall  be  his 
     witness.

     examinations in Liber HHH.
 
     5. Beside all this, he shall apply himself to the work of the A.'. A.'. 
     upon his own responsibility.
 
     Let  him be mindful that the word Zelator is no idle term,  but that  a 
     certain Zeal will be inflamed with him, why he knoweth not.
 
     6.  When  authority confers the grade,  he shall rejoice  therein;  but 
     beware,  for that that is his first departure from the middle pillar of 
     the Tree of Life.
 
     7.  He  may  at any moment withdraw from his association with the  A.'. 
     A.'. simply notifying the Practicus who introduced him.
 
     Yet  let  him remember that being entered thus far upon  the  Path,  he 
     cannot excape it,  and return to the world, but must ultimate either in 
     the City of the Pyramids or the lonely towers of the Abyss.
 
     8.  He  shall everywhere proclaim openly his connection with  the  A.'. 
     A.'.  and  speak  of  It  and  Its principles (even  so  little  as  he 
     understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of Truth.
 
     Furthermore,  he  shall construct the magic Dagger,  according  to  the 
     instruction in Liber A.
 
     One month before the completion of his eight months, he shall deliver a 
     copy of his Record to his Zelator, pass the necessary tests, and repeat 
     to him his chosen chapter of Liber CCXX.

     Consciousness  according to the advice of his Practicus,  for that  the 
     ordeal of advancement is no light one.
 
     10.  Thus and not otherwise may he obtain to the great reward: YEA, MAY 
     HE OBTAIN THE GREAT REWARD!

                         THE TASK OF A DOMINUS LIMINIS.
 
     0. Let any Philosophus be appointed by authority a Dominus Liminis.
 
     Let him then read through this note of his office and sign it.
 
     Let  him  cause the necessary addition to be made to  his  Philosophus' 
     robe.
 
     Let him receive Liber Mysteriorum.
 
     Let him make an appointment with his Dominus Liminis at the pleasure of 
     the latter for the confering of advancement.
 
     1.  The  Dominus Liminis shall proceed to the Grade of Adeptus Minor at 
     any time that authority confers it.
 
     2. He shall pass examination in Liber III, Cap. III.
 
     3.  He  shall meditate on the diverse knowledge and Power that  he  has 
     acquired,  and  harmonize it perfectly.  And in this matter shall he be 
     judged by the Praemonstrator of the A.'. A.'.
 
     4.  He shall accept an office in a Temple of Initiation,  and commit to 
     memory a part appointed by the Imperator of the A.'. A.'.
 
     5. Besides all this, he shall abide upon the Threshold. Let him remember
     that the word Dominus Liminis is no idle term, but that his mastery
     will often be disputed, when he knoweth it not.
 
     6.  When  at last he hath attained the grade of Adeptus Minor,  let him 
     humble himself exceedingly.
 
     7.  He may at any moment withdraw from his association with the A.'. A.'. 
     simply notifying the Adept who introduced him.
 
     8.  He  shall  everywhere proclaim openly his connection with the  A.'. 
     A.'.  and  speak  of  It  and Its principles  (even  so  little  as  he 
     understandeth) for that mystery is the enemy of Truth.
 
     Furthermore,   he   shall  construct  the  magic  Lamp,   according  to 
     instructions in Liber A.
 
     Six months after his admission to the Grade, he shall go to his Adeptus 
     Minor,  pass the necessary tests,  and repeat to him his appointed part 
     in the Temple of Initiation.
 
     9.  He  shall in every way establish perfect control of his  intuition, 
     according  to the advice of his Adeptus Minor,  for that the ordeal  of 
     advancement is no light one.
 
     10.  Thus and not otherwise may he obtain to the great reward: YEA, MAY 
     HE OBTAIN THE GREAT REWARD!
