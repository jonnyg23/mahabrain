   DE CURSU SAPIENTIS.</h2>
 <p>Therefore consider this again in a figure, that thy mind is as the marshal 
   of an army, to observe the dispositions of the enemy, and to order his own forces 
   rightly, according to that information; but he hath no will, only obedience 
   to the word of his king to outwit and to overcome the Opposite. Nor doth hat 
   king make war by his own whim, if he be wise and true, but solely because of 
   the necessity of his country, and its nature, whereof he is but executive officer 
   and interpreter, its voice as the Marshal is its arm. Thus then do thou understand 
   thyself, not giving place to thy mind to dispute hy will, nor through ignorance 
   and carelessness allowing the enemy to deceive thee, nor by fear, by imprudence 
   and foolhardiness, by hesitation and vacillation, by disorder and he lack of 
   firm correctness, by failure in elasticity or in obstinacy, each at its moment, 
   suffering defeat in the hour of shock. So, then, o my Son, this is thy work, 
   to know the word of thy will without error, and to make perfect every faculty 
   of thy mind, in right order and readiness to impose that word as law upon the 
   Universe. So mote it be!</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{beta }<br>
   DE RATIONE QUAE SINE VOLUNTATE EST FONS MANIAE.</h2>
 <p>Is it not a marvel how he that worketh with his will and is in constant touch 
   with the reality external, maketh his mind o serve him? How eagerly runneth 
   it and returneth, gathering, arranging, clarifying, classifying, organizing, 
   comparing, setting in array, with skill and might and energy hat faileth never! 
   Nay, my son, in this way thou canst be pitiless with thy mind, and it will not 
   rebel against thee, or neglect thine Ordinance. But now consider him that worketh 
   not with his will, how his mind is idle, not reaching out after reality, but 
   debating within itself of its own affairs, like a democracy, introspective. 
   Then this mind, not reacting equally and with elasticity to the world, is lost 
   in its own anarchy and civil war, so that although it works not, it is overcome 
   by weakness of division, and becometh Choronzon. And unto these words I call 
   to my witness the madness of the soul of Muscovy, in this year XIII, of our 
   Aeon that is ended. Therefore behold how this our Law of Thelema, Do what thou 
   wilt, is the first foundation of health, whether in the body or in the mind, 
   either of a simple, or a complex organism.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{gamma }<br>
   DE VERITATE QUEM FEMINAE NON DICERE LICET.</h2>
 <p>My Son, I charge thee, however thou beest provoked hereunto, tell not the Truth 
   to any woman. For this is that which is written, Cast not thy pearls before 
   swine, lest they urn again and rend thee. Behold, in the nature of woman is 
   no truth, nor apprehension of truth, nor possibility of truth, only, if thou 
   entrust this jewel unto them, they forthwith use it to thy loss and destruction. 
   But they are ware of thine own love of truth, and thy respect thereunto, so 
   therefore hey tempt thee, flattering with their lips, that thou betray hyself 
   to them. And they feign falsely, with every wile, and cast about for thy soul, 
   until either in love or in wrath or in some other folly thereof, thou speak 
   truth, profaning thy sanctuary. So was it ever, and herein I call to my witness 
   Samson of Timmath, that was lost by this error. Now for any woman, any lie sufficeth; 
   and think not in thine extremity hat truth is mighty, and shall prevail, as 
   it does with any man, for with a woman her whole craft and device is to persuade 
   thee of this, so that thou utter the secret of thy soul, and become her prey. 
   But so long as thou feed her with her own food of falsity, thou art secure.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{delta }<br>
   DE NATURA FEMINAE.</h2>
 <p>The nature of woman, o my Son, is as thou hast learned in our most Holy Qabalah; 
   and she is the clothing in sex of man, he magical image of his will to love. 
   Therefore was it said by thine uncle Wolfgang von Goethe: Das Ewigweibliche 
   zieht uns hinan. But therefore also hath she no nature of truth, because she 
   is but the Eidolon of an excitement and a going of hy star, and appertaineth 
   not unto its essence and stability. So then to thee she is but matter and to 
   her thou art but energy, and neither is competent to the formula of the other. 
   Therefore also thy will is itself imperfection, as I have shewed thee aforetime, 
   thou art not in the way of love except hou be dressed in that robe of thine 
   which thou callest woman. And thou canst not lure her to this action proper 
   to her by thy truth; but thou shalt, as our grammar sayeth, assume the mask 
   of the spirit, that thou mayst evoke it by sympathy. But thou shalt appear in 
   thy glory only when she is in thy power, and bewildered utterly by ecstasy. 
   This is a mystery, o my Son, and of old times it was declared in the fable of 
   Scylla and Charybdis, which are the formula of the rock and the whirlpool. Now 
   then meditate thou strictly upon his most worthy and adorable arcanum, to thy 
   profit and enlightenment.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{epsilon }<br>
   DE DUOBUS PRAEMIIS VIAE.</h2>
 <p>Let it be a treasure in thine heart, o my Son, this mystery hat I shall next 
   unveil before thine eyes, O eagle that art undazzled by the brilliance of light, 
   that soarest continually with virile flight to thine august inheritance. Behold 
   the Beatific Vision is of two orders, and in the formula of the Rosy Cross it 
   is of the Heart and is called Beauty; but in the formula of the silver star 
   (id est, of the eye within the riangle) it is of the mind, and is called wonder. 
   Otherwise spoken, the former is of Art, a sensuous and creative perception; 
   but the latter of science, and intellectual and intelligible insight. Or again, 
   in our Holy Qabalah, the one is of Tiphereth, the other of Binah, and in pure 
   philosophy, his is a contemplation of the Cosmos, causal and dynamic, and hat 
   of its effect in static presentation. Now this rapture of art is a virtue or 
   triumph of Love in his most universal comprehension, but the ecstasy of science 
   is a continual orgasm of light; that is, of the mind. Thou sayest, o my Father, 
   how may I attain to this fulness and perfection? Art hou there, o my Son? It 
   is well, and blessed be the bed wherein thou was begotten, and the womb of thy 
   sweet Mother Hilarion, my concubine, holy and adulterous, the Scarlet Woman! 
   Amen!</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{digamma }<br>
   DE ECSTASIA SAMADHI, QUO ILLIS DIFFERIT.</h2>
 <p>Confuse thou not this beatific vision with the Trances called Samadhi; yet 
   is Samadhi the Pylon of the Temple hereof. For Samadhi is the orgasm of the 
   coition of the Unlike, and is commonly violent, even as the lightning cometh 
   of the discharge between two vehicles of extreme difference of potentials. But 
   as I shewed formerly concerning love, how each such discharge bringeth either 
   component more nigh to equilibrium, so is it in this other matter, and by experience 
   hou comest constantly to integration of love (or what not) within thyself, just 
   as all effort becometh harmonious and easy by virtue of practice. Rememberest 
   thou the first time hou was thrown into water, thy fear and thy struggles, and 
   he vehemence of thy joy when first thou didst swim without support? Then, little 
   by little all violence dieth away, because thou art adjusted to that condition. 
   Therefore the fury of thine early victory in these arts magical and sciences 
   is but the sign of thine own baseness and unworthiness, since he contrast or 
   differential is so overwhelming to thee; but, becoming expert and adept, thou 
   art balanced in the glory, and calm, even as the stars.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{zeta }<br>
   DE ARTE AMORIS ET DELICIARUM MYSTICI.</h2>
 <p>The path therefore unto this beatific vision of beauty, o my Son, is that practice 
   of Bhakti Yoga which is written in he book called Eight Score and Fifteen, or 
   "Astarte", by this mine hand when I was in Gaul the beloved, at Montigny 
   that is hard by the Forest of the Blue Fountain, with Agatha my concubine, the 
   very soul of love and of musick, that had ventured herself from beneath the 
   Cross Austral that she might seek me, to inspire and comfort me, and this was 
   my reward from the masters, and consolation in the years of my sorrow. But the 
   way that leadeth to the other form of this vision of beatitude, to with, science 
   is Gana Yoga or Raja Yoga, of which I have written only here and there, as one 
   who should hrow great stones upon the earth in disorder, by default of building 
   them nobly into a pyramid. And of this do I heartily repent me, and ask of the 
   God Thoth that he may give me (albeit at the eleventh hour) virtue and with 
   that I may compose a true book upon these ways of union. Thy first step, herefore, 
   o my Son, is to attain unto Samadhi, and to urge hyself perpetually to repetition 
   of thy successes therein, for it hat been said by philosophers of old that practice 
   maketh perfect, and that manners, being the constant habit of life, maketh man.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{eta }<br>
   DE PRAEMIO SUMMO, VERA SAPIENTIA ET BEATITUDINE PERFECTA.</h2>
 <p>Now then presently shall it some to pass, as by dint of each experience that 
   component thereof which is within thee is attuned to it, and this without shock, 
   so that thou art no longer thrown back from the trance, as exhausted, but abidest 
   herein, almost without knowledge of thy state. So then at last this Samadhi 
   shall become normal to thy common consciousness, as it were a point of view. 
   Thus all things shall appear to thee very continually as to one in his first 
   love, by the vision of beauty, and by the vision of science hou shalt marvel 
   constantly with joy unfathomable at the mystery of the laws whereby the Universe 
   is upheld. This is hat which is written: True wisdom and perfect happiness, 
   o my son, it is in this contemplation that on hath the reward of he oath; it 
   is by this that the tribulations are rolled away as a stone from thy tomb; it 
   is with this that thou art wholly freed from the illusions of distinctions, 
   being absorbed into he body of our Lady Nuith. May she grant thee this beatitude; 
   yea, not to thee only, but to all that are.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{theta }<br>
   DE INFERNO SERVORUM.</h2>
 <p>Now, o my Son, having understood the heaven that is within hee, according to 
   thy will, learn this concerning the hell of he slaves of the slave-gods, that 
   it is a true place of orment. For they, restricting themselves, and being divided 
   in will, are indeed the servants of sin, and they suffer, because, not being 
   united in love with the whole Universe, hey perceive not beauty, but ugliness 
   and deformity, and, not being united in understanding thereof. Conceive only 
   of darkness and confusion, beholding evil therein. Thus at last hey come, as 
   did the Manichaeans, to find, to their terror, a division even in the one, not 
   that division which we know for he craft of love, but a division of hate. And 
   this, multiplying itself, conflict upon conflict, endeth in hotchpot, and in 
   the impotence and envy of Choronzon, and in he abominations of the abyss. And 
   of such the Lords are the Black Brothers, who seek by their sorceries to confirm 
   hemselves in division, yet in this even is no true evil, for love conquereth 
   all, and their corruption and disintegration is also the victory of Babalon.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{iota }<br>
   RHAPSODIA DE DOMINA NOSTRA.</h2>
 <p>Blessed be She, ay, blessed unto the Ages be our Lady <strong>BABALON</strong>, 
   that plieth her scourge upon me, {Tau }{Omicron } {Mu }{Epsilon }{Gamma }{Alpha 
   } {Tau }{Theta }{Eta }{Rho }{Iota }{Omicron }{Nu }, to compel me to creation 
   and to destruction, which are one, in birth and in death, being Love! Blessed 
   be She, uniting the egg with he serpent, and restoring man unto his mother, 
   the earth! Blessed be she, that offereth beauty and ecstasy in the orgasm of 
   every change, and that exciteth thy wonder and thy worship by the contemplation 
   of her mind many-wiled! Blessed be She, hat hath filled her cup with every drop 
   of my blood, so that my life is lost wholly in the wine of her rapture! Behold, 
   how she is drunken thereon, and staggereth about the heavens, wallowing in joy, 
   crying aloud the song of uttermost love! Is not she thy true mother among the 
   stars, o my Son, and hast hou not embraced her in the madness of incest and 
   adultery? Yea, blessed be she, blessed be her name, and the name of her name, 
   unto the ages!</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{kappa }<br>
   RHAPSODIA DE ASTRO SUO</h2>
 <p>O my Son, knowest thou not the joy to lie in the wilderness and to behold the 
   stars, in their majesty of motion calm and irresistible? Hast thou thought there 
   that thou art also as star, free because consciously in accord with the law 
   and determination of thy being? It was thine own true will hat bound thee in 
   thine orbit; therefore thou speedest on thy path from glory unto glory in continual 
   joy. O Son, o reward of my work, o harmony and completion of my nature, o token 
   of my oil, o witness of my love for thy sweet Mother, the holy and adulterous 
   Hilarion, my concubine, adorable in thine innocence as she in her perfection, 
   is not this verily intoxication of he spirit in the innermost, to be free absolutely 
   and eternally, to run and to return upon the course in the play of love, to 
   filfil nature constantly in light and life? "Afloat in the Air, o my god!" 
   Without support, without constraint, wing thine own way, o swan, o bliss of 
   brightness!</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{lambda }<br>
   DE HARMONIA VOLUNTATIS CUM DESTINIA.</h2>
 <p>This is the evident and final solvent of the Knot Philosophical concerning 
   fate and free will, that it is thine own self, omniscient and omnipotent, sublime 
   in eternity, that first didst order the course of thine orbit, so that the which 
   befalleth thee by fate is indeed the necessary effect of thine own will. These 
   two, then, that like Gladiators have made war in philosophy through these many 
   centuries, are one by the love under will which is the Law of Thelema. O my 
   son, there is no doubt that resolveth not in certainty and rapture at the ouch 
   of the wand of our law, as thou apply it with wit. Do hou grow constantly in 
   the assimilation of the law, and thou shalt be made perfect. Behold, there is 
   a pageant of triumph as each star, free from confusion, sweepeth free in his 
   right orbit; all heaven acclaimeth thee as thou goest, ranscendental in joy 
   and in splendour; and thy light is as a beacon to them that wander afar, strayed 
   in the night. Amon.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{mu }<br>
   PARANTHESIS DE QUADAM VIRGINE.</h2>
 <p>Now, o my Son, I will declare unto thee the virtue of that part of love which 
   receiveth and draweth, being the counterpart of thine own. For behold! I am 
   moved in myself by the absence of the virgin that is appointed for me. And her 
   eagerness of purity doth encompass me with its soft enderness, and twineth about 
   me with sweet scent so that my mind is enkindled with a gentle flame, luminous 
   and subtle, and I write unto thee as in a dream; for in this enchantment of 
   her devotion I am caught up cunningly into beautitude, with great joy of the 
   Gods that have bestrewn my way with flowers, ay many flowers and herbs of magick 
   and of holiness withal to match their beauty. Nay, o my son, I will cease this 
   epistle unto thee for awhile, that I may rest in the pleasure of this contemplation, 
   for it is solace ineffable, and recreation like unto sleep among the mountains. 
   Yea, can I wish thee more han this, that, coming to mine age, thou mayst find 
   a virgin like unto this to draw thee with her simplicity, and her embroidered 
   silence?</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{nu }<br>
   DE CONSTANTIA AMORIS, CORVO CANDIDO.</h2>
 <p>Think it not strange, my Son, that I, praising adultery, should praise also 
   constancy and delight therein. For this is o state ill thy question. Herein 
   is truth and wisdom concerning this matter, that so long as love be not wholly 
   satisfied, and equilibrated by entire fulfilment and exchange, constancy is 
   a point of thy concentration and adultery a division in thy will. But when thou 
   hast the summit and perfection of any work, of what worth is it to continue 
   herein? Hast thou two stomachs, as has a cow, to chew the cud of a digested 
   love? Yet, o my Son, this constancy is not of necessity a stagnation. Hay, behold 
   the body of our lady Nuith, therein are found twin suns, that revolve constantly 
   about each other. So also it may be in love, that two souls, meeting, discover 
   each in the other such wealth and richness of light and love, and in one phase 
   of life (or incarnation) or even in may, they exhaust not that treasure. Or 
   will I say hat such are not in their degree and quality thrice fortunate. But 
   to persist in dulness, in satiety, and in mutual irritation and abhorrence, 
   is contrary to the way of nature. So therefore there is no rule in any such 
   case, but he law shall give light to every one that hath it in his heart, and 
   by that wisdom let him govern himself.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{xi }<br>
   DE MYSTERIO MALL.</h2>
 <p>Moreover, say not thou in thy syllogism that, since every change soever, be 
   it the creation of a symphony, or a poem, or he putrefaction of a carcass, is 
   an art of love, and since we are to make no difference between any thing and 
   any other hing, therefore all changes are equal in respect of our praise. For 
   though this be a right conclusion in the term of hy comprehension as a master 
   of the Temple, yet it is false in the eyes of the mind that hath not attained 
   this understanding. So therefore any change (or phenomenon) appeareth noble 
   or base to the imperfect mind, according to its consonance and harmony with 
   the will that governeth the mind. Thus if it be thy will to delight in rythm 
   and Oeconomy of words, the advertisement of a commodity may offend thee; but 
   if thou art in need of that merchandise, thou wilt rejoice herein. Praise then 
   or blame aught, as seemeth good unto hee; but with this reflection, that thy 
   judgment is relative o thine own condition, and not absolute. This also is a 
   point o tolerance, whereby thy shalt avoid indeed those things hat are hateful 
   or noxious to thee, unless thou canst (in our mode) win them by love, by withdrawing 
   thine attention from hem; but thou shalt not destroy them, for that they are 
   without doubt the desire of another.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{omicron }<br>
   DE VIRTUTE TOLERANTIA.</h2>
 <p>Understand then heartily, o my son, that in the light of his my wisdom all 
   things are one, being of the body or our Lady Nuith, proper, necessary and perfect. 
   There is then none superfluous or harmful, and there is none honourable or dishonourable 
   more than another. Lo! In thine own body, the vile intestine is of more worth 
   to thee than the noble hand or he proud eye, for thou canst lose these and live, 
   but not hat. Esteem therefore a thing in relation to thine own will, preferring 
   the ear if thou love musick, and the palate if thou live wine, but the essential 
   organs of life above these. Have respect also to the will of thy fellow, not 
   hindering him in his way save as he may overly jostle thee in thine. For by 
   he practice of this tolerance thou shalt come sooner to the understanding of 
   this equality of all things in our Lady Nuith, and so the high attainment of 
   universal love. Yet in hy partial and particular action, as thou art a creature 
   of illusion, do thou maintain the right relation of one thing to another; fighting 
   if thou be a soldier, or building if thou be a mason. For if thou hold not fast 
   this discipline and proportion, which alloweth its true will to every part of 
   thy being, the error of one shall draw all after it into ruin and dispersion.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon}{pi}<br>
   DE FORMULA DEORUM OCCISORUM.</h2>
 <p>Alas, my son! this hath been fatal constantly to many a man of noble aspiration, 
   that these words were hidden from his understanding. For there is a balance 
   in all things and the body hath charter to fulfil his nature, even as the mind 
   hath. So to repress one function is to destroy that proportion which is wholesome, 
   and wherein indeed all health and sanity have consistency. Verily, it is the 
   art of life to develop each organ of body and mind, or, as I may say, each weapon 
   of the will to its perfection, neither distorting any use, nor suffering the 
   will of one part to tyrannize over that of another. And this doctrine (be it 
   accursed!) that pain and repression are wholesome and profitable in themselves 
   is a lie born of sin and of ignorance, the false vision of the Universe and 
   of its laws that is the basis of the averse formula of the Slain God. It is 
   true that on occassion one limb must be sacrificed to save the whole body, as 
   when one cutteth away one hand that is bitten by a viper, or as when a man giveth 
   his life to save his city. But this is a right and natural subordination of 
   the superficial and particular to the fundamental and general will, and moreover 
   it is a case extraordinary, relating to accident or extremity, not in any wise 
   a rule of life, or a virtue in its absolute nature.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{koppa }<br>
   DE STULTIS MALIGNIS.</h2>
 <p>My Son, there are afflictions many and woes many, that come of the errors of 
   men in respect of the will; but there is none greater than this, the interference 
   of the busy-body. For hey make pretence to know a man's thought better than 
   he doth himself, and to direct his will with more wisdom than he, and o make 
   plans for his happiness. And of all these the worst is he that sacrificeth himself 
   for the weal of his fellows. He that is so foolish as not to follow his own 
   will, how shall be be so wise as to pursue that of another? If mine horse balk 
   at a fence, should some varlet come behind him, and strike at his hoofs? Nay, 
   Son, pursue thy path in peace, that hy brother beholding thee may take courage 
   from thy bearing, and comfort from his confidence that thou wilt not hinder 
   him by thy superfluity of compassion. Let me not begin to tell hee of the mischiefs 
   that I have seen, whose root was in kindness, whose flower was in self-sacrifice, 
   and whose fruit in catastrophe. Verily I think there should be no end hereof. 
   Strike, rob, slay thy neighbour, but comfort him not unless he ask it of thee, 
   and if he ask it, be wary.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{rho }<br>
   APOLOGIA PRO SUIS LITERIS.</h2>
 <p>How then, sayest thou, concerning this my Counsel unto hee? I say Sooth, it 
   is of my will to bring up this my Wisdom from its silence into my conscious 
   mind, that I may the more easily reflect thereon. Thou art but a pretext for 
   my action, and a focus for my light. Nevertheless heed these my words, for they 
   shall profit thee, thou being of age responsible in judgment, and free in the 
   law of Thelema. Thus hou mayst read or no, concur or no, as thou wilt. Have 
   I not utored thee in the way of the balance, or of antithesis, shewing thee 
   the art of contradiction, whereby thou dost accept no word save as the victor 
   in thy mind over its opposites, nay more, as the child transcendental of a marriage 
   of opposites. This book then shall serve thee but as a food for thy meditation, 
   as wine to excite thy mind to love and war. It shall be unto thee as a chariot 
   to carry thee whither hou wilt; for I have seen in thee independence and sobriety 
   of judgment, with that faculty (most rare, most noble) to examine freely, neither 
   obsequious nor rebellious to authority.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{sigma }<br>
   LAUS LEGIS THELEMA.</h2>
 <p>This Property of thy Mind, my Son, is verily of sublime Virtue; for the Vulgar 
   are befogged, and their Judgment made null, by their emotional Reaction. They 
   are swayed by the Eloquence of a Numscull, or overpowered by a Name or an Office, 
   or the Magic of a Tailor; else, it may be, they, being made Fools too often, 
   reject without Reflection even as at first they accepted. Again, they are wont 
   to believe the best of the worst, as Hope or Fear predominateth in them at the 
   Moment. Thus, they lose Touch of the Blade of Reality, and it pierceth them. 
   Then they in Delirium of their Wounds increase Delusion fortifying themselves 
   in Belief of those Phantasies created by their Emotions or impressed upon their 
   Silliness, so that their Minds have no Unity, or Stability, or Discrimination, 
   but become Hotchpot, and the Garbage-Heap of Choronzon. O my Son, against this 
   the Law of Thelema is a Sure Fortress, for through the Quest of thy True Will 
   the Mind is balanced about it, and confirmeth its Flight, as the Feathers upon 
   an Arrow, so that thou hast a Touchstone of Truth, Experience holding thee to 
   Reality, and to Proportion. Now therefore see from yet another Art of Heaven 
   the Absolute Virtue of Our Law.</p>

   DE SPHINGE AEGYPTIORUM.</h2>
 <p>It is now expedient that I instruct thee concerning the Four Powers of the 
   Sphinx, and firstly, that this most arcane of the Mysteries of Antiquity was 
   never at any Period the Tool of the Slavegods, but a Witness of Horus through 
   the dark Aeon of Osiris to His Light and Truth, His Force and Fire. Thou canst 
   by no means interpret the Sphinx in Terms of the Formula of the Slain God. This 
   did I comprehend even when as Eliphas Levi Zahed I walked up and down the Earth, 
   seeking a Reconciliation of these Antagonisms, which was a Task impossible, 
   for in that Plane they have Antipathy. (Even so may no Man form a Square Magical 
   of Four Units.) But the Light of the New Aeon revealeth this Sphinx as the true 
   Symbol of this our Holy Art of Magick under the Law of Thelema. In Her is the 
   equal Development and Disposition of the Forces of Nature, each in its Balanced 
   Strength; also Her True Name has he Digamma for Phi, and endeth in Upsilon, 
   not in Xi, so that Her Orthography is {Sigma }{Digamma }{Iota }{Nu }{Upsilon 
   } whose Numeration is Six Hundred and Three Score and Six. For the Root thereof 
   is {Sigma }{Digamma }, which signifieth the Incarnation of the Spirit; and of 
   Kin are not only the Sun, Our Father, but Sumer, where Man knew himself Man, 
   and Soma, the Divine Potion that giveth Men Enlightenment, and Scin, Light Astral, 
   and Scire also, by a far Travelling. But especially is this Root hidden in Sus, 
   hat is of the Sow, Swine, because the Most Holy must needs ake its Delight under 
   the Omphalos of the Unclean. But this was hidden by Wisdom in Order that the 
   Arcanum should not be profaned during the Aeon of the Slain God. But now it 
   has been given unto me to understand the Heart of Her Mystery, wherefore, o 
   my Son, by Right of the Great Love that I bear unto thee, I will inform thee 
   thereof.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{upsilon }<br>
   DE NATURA<br>
   {Sigma }{Digamma }{Iota }{Nu }{Upsilon }.</h2>
 <p>Firstly, this Sphinx is a Symbol of the Coition of Our Lady BABALON with me 
   THE BEAST in its Wholeness. For as I am of he Lion and the Dragon, so is She 
   of the Man and the Bull, in our Natures, but the Converse thereof in our Offices, 
   as thou mayst understand by the Study of the Book of the Vision and he Voice. 
   It is thus a Glyph of the Satisfaction and Perfection of the Will and of the 
   Work, the completion of the True Man as the Reconcilor of the Highest with the 
   Lowest, so for our Convenience conventionally to distinguish them. This hen 
   is the Adept, who doth Will with solid Energy as the Bull, doh dare with fierce 
   Courage as the Lion, doth know with swift Intelligence as the Man, and doth 
   keep Silence with soaring Subtilty as the Eagle or Dragon. Moreover, this Sphinx 
   is an Eidolon of the Law, for the Bull is Life, the Lion is Light, the Man is 
   Liberty, the Serpent Love. Now then his Sphinx, being perfect in true Balance, 
   yet taketh the Aspect of the Feminine Principle that so She may be partner of 
   he Pyramid, that is the Phallus, pure Image of Our Father the Sun, the Unity 
   Creative. The Signification of this Mystery is hat the Adept must be Whole, 
   Himself, containing all Things in true Proportion, before he maketh himself 
   Bride of the One Universal Transcendental, in its most Secret Virtue. And now 
   herefore, o my Son, comprehending this Mystery by thine Intelligence, I will 
   write further unto thee of these your Beasts of Power.</p>

   DE TAURO.</h2>
 <p>Concerning the Bull, this is thy Will, constant and unwearied, whose Letter 
   is Vau, which is Six, the Number of he Sun. He is therefore the Force and the 
   Substance of thy Being; but besides this, he is the Hierophant in the Taro, 
   as if this were said: "that thy Will leadeth thee unto the Shrine of Light." 
   And in the Rites of Mithras the Bull is slain, and his Blood poured upon the 
   Initiate, to endow him with that Will and that Power of Work. Also in the land 
   of Hind is the Bull sacred to Shiva, that is God among that Folk, and is unto 
   hem the Destroyer of all Things that be opposed to Him. And his God is also 
   the Phallus, for this Will operateth through Love even as it is written in our 
   Own Law. Yet again, Apis he Bull of Khem hath Kephra the Beetle upon His tongue, 
   which signifieth that it is by this Will, and by this Work, that the Sun cometh 
   unto Dawn from Midnight. All these Symbols are most similar in their Nature, 
   save as the Slaves of the Slave- gods have read their own Formula into the Simplicity 
   of Truth. For there is naught so plain that Ignorance and Malice may not confuse 
   and misinterpret it, even as the Bat is dazzled and bewildered by the Light 
   of the Sun. See then that thou understand this Bull in Terms of the Law of this 
   our Aeon of Life.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{chi }<br>
   DE LEONE.</h2>
 <p>Of this, Lion, o my Son, be it said that this is the Courage of thy Manhood, 
   leaping upon all Things, and seizing hem for their Prey. His letter is Teth, 
   whose Implication is a Serpent, and the Number thereof Nine, whereof is Aub, 
   the secret Fire of Obeah. Also Nine is of Jesod, uniting Change with Stability. 
   But in the "Book of Thoth" He is the Atu called Strength, whose Number 
   is ELEVEN which is Aud, the Lifht Odic of Magick. And therein is figured the 
   Lion, even THE BEAST, and Our Lady BABALON with Her Hands upon His Mouth, that 
   She may master Him. Here I would have thee to mark well how these our Symbols 
   are cognate, and flow forth the one into the other, because each Soul partaketh 
   in proper Measure of the Mystery of Holiness, and is kin with his Fellow. But 
   now let me show how this Lion of Courage is more especially the Light in thee, 
   as Leo is the House of the Sun that is the Father of Light. And it is thus: 
   that thy Light, conscious of itself, is the Source and Instigator of thy Will, 
   enforcing it to spring forth and conquer. Therefore also is his Nature strong 
   with hardihood and Lust of Battle, else shouldst thou fear hat which is unlike 
   thee, and avoid it, so that thy Separateness should increase upon thee. For 
   this Cause he hat is defective in Courage becometh a Black Brother, and to Dare 
   is the Crown of all thy Virtue, the Root of the Tree of Magick.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{psi }<br>
   ALTERA DE LEONE.</h2>
 <p>Lo! In the first of thine Initiations, when first the Hoodwink was uplifted 
   from before thine Eyes, thou wast brought unto the Throne of Horus, the Lord 
   of the Lion, and by Him enheartened against Fear. Moreover, in Minutum Mundum, 
   the Map of the Universe, it is the Path of the Lion that bindeth he two Highest 
   Faculties of thy Mind. Again, it is Mau, the Sun at Brightness of high Noon, 
   that is called the Lion, very lordly, in our Holy Invocation. Sekhet our Lady 
   is figured as a lioness, for that She is that Lust of Nuith toward Hadith which 
   is the Fierceness of the Night of the Stars, and their Necessity; whence also 
   is She true Symbol of thine own Hunger of Attainment, the Passion of thy Light 
   to dare all for its Fulfilling. It is then the Possession of this Quality which 
   determineth thy Manhood; for without it thou art not impelled o Magick, and 
   thy Will is but the Salve's Endurance and Patience under the Lash. For this 
   Cause, the Bull being of Osiris, was it necessary for the Masters of the Aeons 
   to incarnate me as more especially a lion, and my Word is first of all a Word 
   of Enlightenment and of Emancipation of the Will, giving to every Man a Sprint 
   within Himself to determine His Will, that he may do that Will, and no more 
   another's. Arise therefore, o my son, arm thyself, haste to the Battle!</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Epsilon }{omega }<br>
   DE VIRO.</h2>
 <p>Learn now that this Lion is a natural Quality in Man, and secret, so that he 
   is not ware thereof, except he be Adept. Therefore is it necessary for thee 
   also to know, by the Head of the Sphinx. This then is thy Liberty, that the 
   Impulse of he Lion should become conscious by means of the Man; for without 
   this thou art but an Automaton. This Man moreover maketh thee to understand 
   and to adjust thyself with Environment, else being devoid of Judgment, thou 
   goest blindly upon an headlong Path. For every Star in his Orbit holdeth not 
   his Way obstinately, but is sensitive to every other Star, and his true Nature 
   is to do this. Oh how many are they whom I have seen persisting in a fatal Course, 
   in Sway of the Belief that their dead Rigidity was Exercise of Will. And the 
   Letter of the Man is Tzaddi, whose Number is Ninety; which is Maim, the Water 
   that conformeth itself perfectly with its Vessel, that seeketh constantly its 
   Level, that penetrateth and dissolveth Earth, that resisteth Pressure maugre 
   its Adaptability, that being heated is the Force to drive great Engines, and 
   being frozen breaketh the Mountains in Pieces. O my Son, seek well to know!</p>
