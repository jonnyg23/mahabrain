   year. A formal examination is required in these matters (a perfect score is 
   not necessary) before advancement to the First Degree. </p>
 <ol>
   <li>Study THE BOOK OF THE LAW. Memorization of the first Chapter is suggested. 
     This may be done a verse a day, with review at inter- vals--that's often the 
     easy way.</li>
   <li>Keep a daily Journal or Magical Diary.</li>
   <li>Practice LIBER RESH daily.</li>
   <li>Become proficient in the Lesser Pentagram Banishing Ritual--twice daily 
     use is wise.</li>
   <li>Do "Will" at the beginnning of the main meal of the day</li>
   <li>Study MAGICK IN THEORY AND PRACTICE. See the study guide in the 2nd issue 
     of the O.T.O. NEWSLETTER.</li>
   <li>Keep in touch! P.O. Box 2303, Berkeley, CA 94702 U.S.A. (415) 454- 5176 
     and 841-4833. </li>
 </ol>
 <p><strong>WILL: </strong></p>
 <blockquote> 
   <blockquote> 
     <p>Knock: 333 - 55555 - 333 (total 11 knocks) </p>
     <p>"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." </p>
     <p>** What is thy will? </p>
     <p>It is my will to eat and drink. </p>
     <p>** To what end? </p>
     <p>That my body may be fortified thereby. </p>
     <p>** To what end? </p>
     <p>That I may accomplish the Great Work. </p>
     <p>"Love is the law, love under will." </p>
     <p>Knock: 1 "Fall to." </p>

     and beyond the minds of your immediate associates.</li>

     into pity, advice into meddling, temperance into apathy, excellence into illusion, 
     gentleness into shallowness and like matters. Record your findings in your 
     diary with both theoretical views and actual examples from your daily life.
