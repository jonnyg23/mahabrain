   THE EQUINOX (Volume III, No. VIII.)</h3>
 <h3 align="center">INTRODUCTION</h3>
 <p>I bound myself to devote my life to Magick at Easter 1898, and received my 
   first initiation on November 18 of that year.</p>
 <p>My friend and climbing companion, Oscar Eckenstein, gave me my first instructions 
   in learning the control of the mind early in 1901 in Mexico City. Shri Parananda, 
   Solicitor General of Ceylon and an eminent writer upon and teacher of Yoga from 
   the orthodox Shaivite standpoint, and Bhikkhu Ananda Metteya, the great English 
   Adept, who was one of my earliest instructors in Magick and joined the Sangha 
   in Burma in 1902, gave me my first groundings in mystical theory and practice. 
   I spent some months of 1901 in Kandy, Ceylon, with the latter until success 
   crowned my work.</p>
 <p>I also studied all varieties of Asiatic philosophy, especially with regard 
   to the practical question of spiritual development, the Sufi doctrines, the 
   Upanishads, the Sankhya, Vedanta, the Bagavad Gita and Purana, the Dhammapada, 
   and many other classics, together with numerous writings on the Tantra and Yoga 
   of such men as Patanjali, Vivekananda, etc. etc. Not a few of these teachings 
   are as yet wholly unknown to scholars. I made the scope of {1} my studies as 
   comprehensive as possible, omitting no school of thought however unimportant 
   or repugnant.</p>
 <p>I made a critical examination of all these teachers in the light of my practical 
   experiences. The physiological and psychological uniformity of mankind guaranteed 
   that the diversity of expression concealed a unity of significance. This discovery, 
   furthermore, was confirmed by reference to Jewish, Greek and Celtic traditions. 
   One quintessential truth was common to all cults, from the Hebrides to the Yellow 
   Sea, and even the main branches proved essentially identical. It was only the 
   foliage that exhibited incompatibility.</p>
 <p>When I walked across China in 1905-6, I was fully armed and accoutred by the 
   above qualifications to attack the till-then-insoluble problem of the Chinese 
   conception of religious truth. Practical studies of the psychology of such Mongolians 
   as I had met in my travels, had already suggested to me that their acentric 
   conception of the universe might represent the correspondence in consciousness 
   of their actual psychological characteristics. I was therefore prepared to examine 
   the doctrines of their religious and {2} philosophical Masters without prejudice 
   such as had always rendered nugatory the efforts of missionary sinologists and 
   indeed all oriental scholars with the single exception of Rhys Davids. Until 
   his time translators had invariably assumed, with absurd naivite, or more often 
   arrogant bigotry, that a Chinese writer must either be putting forth a more 
   or less distorted and degraded variation of some Christian conception, or utterly 
   puerile absurdities. Even so great a man as Max Muller in his introduction to 
   the Upanishads seems only half inclined to admit that the apparent triviality 
   and folly of many passages in these so-called sacred writings might owe their 
   appearance to our ignorance of the historical and religious circumstances, a 
   knowledge of which would render them intelligible.</p>
 <p>During my solitary wanderings among the mountainous wastes of Yun Nan, the 
   spiritual atmosphere of China penetrated my consciousness, thanks to the absence 
   of any intellectual impertinences from the organ of knowledge. The TAO TEH KING 
   revealed its simplicity and sublimity to my soul, little by little, as the conditions 
   of my physical life, no less than of my spiritual, penetrated the {3} sanctuaries 
   of my spirit. The philosophy of Lao Tze communicated itself to me, in despite 
   of the persistent efforts of my mind to compel it to conform with my preconceived 
   notions of what the text must mean. This process, having thus taken root in 
   my innermost intuition during those tremendous months of wandering across Yun 
   Nan, grew continually throughout succeeding years. Whenever I found myself able 
   once more to withdraw myself from the dissipations and distractions which contact 
   with civilisation forces upon one, no matter how vigorously he may struggle 
   against their insolence, to the sacred solitude of the desert, whether among 
   the sierras of Spain, or the sands of the Sahara, I found that the philosophy 
   of Lao Tze resumed its sway upon my soul, subtler and stronger on each successive 
   occasion.</p>
 <p>But neither Europe nor Africa can show such desolation as America. The proudest, 
   stubbornest, bitterest peasant of deserted Spain; the most primitive and superstitious 
   Arab of the remotest oases, these are a little more than kin and never less 
   than kind at their worst; whereas in the United States one is almost always 
   conscious of an instinctive lack of sympathy and understanding with even the 
   {4} most charming and cultured people. It was therefore during my exile in America 
   that the doctrines of Lao Tze developed most rapidly in my soul, even forcing 
   their way outwards until I felt it imperious, nay inevitable, to express them 
   in terms of conscious thought.</p>
 <p>No sooner had this resolve taken possession of me than I realized that the 
   task approximated to impossibility. His very simplest ideas, the primitive elements 
   of his thought, had no true correspondences in any European terminology. The 
   very first word "Tao" presented a completely insoluble problem. It 
   had been translated "Reason," the "Way," "TO ON." 
   None of these covey the faintest conception of the Tao.</p>
 <p>The Tao is "Reason" in this sense, that the substance of things may 
   be in part apprehended as being that necessary relation between the elements 
   of thought which determines the laws of reason. In other words, the only reality 
   is that which compels us to connect the various forms of illusion as we do. 
   It is thus evidently unknowable, and expressible neither by speech nor by silence. 
   All that we can know about it is that there is inherent in it a {5} power (which, 
   however, is not itself) by virtue whereof all beings appear in forms congruous 
   with the nature of necessity.</p>
 <p>The Tao is also the Way -- in the following sense. Nothing exists except as 
   a relation with other similarly postulated ideas. Nothing can be known in itself, 
   but only as one of the participants in a series of events. Reality is therefore 
   in the motion, not in the things moved. We cannot apprehend anything except 
   as one postulated element of an observed impression of change. We may express 
   this in other terms as follows. Our knowledge of anything is in reality the 
   sum of our observations of its successive movements, that is to say, of its 
   path from event to event. In this sense the Tao may be translated as the Way. 
   It is not a thing in itself in the sense of being an object susceptible of apprehension 
   by sense or mind. It is not the cause of any thing, but the category underlying 
   all existence or event, and therefore true and real as they are illusory, being 
   merely landmarks invented for convenience in describing our experiences. The 
   Tao possesses no power to cause anything to exist or to take place. Yet our 
   experience when analyzed tells {6} us that the only reality of which we may 
   be sure is this path or Way which resumes the whole of our knowledge.</p>
 <p>As for TO ON, which superficially might seem the best translation of Tao as 
   described in the text, it is the most misleading of the three. For TO ON possesses 
   an extensive connotation implying a whole system of Platonic concepts than which 
   nothing can be more alien to the essential quality of the Tao. Tao is neither 
   being nor not-being in any sense which Europe could understand. It is neither 
   existence nor a condition or form of existence. At the same time, TO MH ON gives 
   no idea of Tao. Tao is altogether alien to all that class of thought. From its 
   connection with "that principle which necessarily underlies the fact that 
   events occur" one might suppose that the "Becoming" of Heraclitus 
   might assist us to describe the Tao. But the Tao is not a principle at all of 
   that kind. To understand it requires an altogether different state of mind to 
   any with which European thinkers in general are familiar. It is necessary to 
   pursue unflinchingly the path of spiritual development on the lines indicated 
   by the Sufis, the Hindus and the Buddhists; {7} and having reached the Trance 
   called Nerodha-Sammapati, in which are destroyed all forms soever of consciousness, 
   there appears in that abyss of annihilation the germ of an entirely new type 
   of idea, whose principal characteristic is this: that the entire concatenation 
   of one's previous experiences and conceptions could not have happened at all, 
   save by virtue of this indescribable necessity.</p>
 <p>I am only too painfully aware that the above exposition is faulty in every 
   respect. In particular it presupposes in the reader considerable familiarity 
   with the substance, thus practically begging the question. It must also prove 
   almost wholly unintelligible to the average reader, him in fact whom I especially 
   aim to interest. For his sake I will try to elucidate the matter by an analogy. 
   Consider electricity. It would be absurd to say that electricity is any of the 
   phenomena by which we know it. We take refuge in the petitio principii of saying 
   that electricity is that form of energy which is the principle cause of such 
   and such phenomena. Suppose now that we eliminate this idea as evidently illogical. 
   What remains? We must not hastily answer, "Nothing {8} remains." There 
   is some thing inherent in the nature of consciousness, reason, perception, sensation, 
   and of the universe of which they inform us, which is responsible for the fact 
   that we observe these phenomena and not others; that we reflect upon them as 
   we do, and not otherwise. But even deeper than this, part of the reality of 
   the inscrutable energy which determines the form of our experience, consists 
   in determining that experience should take place at all. It should be clear 
   that this has nothing to do with any of the Platonic conceptions of the nature 
   of things.</p>
 <p>The least abject asset in the intellectual bankruptcy of European thought is 
   the Hebrew Qabalah. Properly understood it is a system of symbolism infinitely 
   elastic, assuming no axioms, postulating no principles, asserting no theorems, 
   and therefore adaptable, if managed adroitly, to describe any conceivable doctrine. 
   It has been my continual study since 1898, and I have found it of infinite value 
   in the study of the Tao Teh King. By its aid I was able to attribute the ideas 
   of Lao Tze to an order with which I was exceedingly familiar, and whose practical 
   worth I had repeatedly proved by using {9} it as the basis of the analysis and 
   classification of all Aryan and Semitic religions and philosophies. Despite 
   the essential difficulty of correlating the ideas of Lao Tze with any others, 
   the persistent application of the Qabalistic keys eventually unlocked his treasure-house. 
   I was able to explain to myself his teachings in terms of familiar systems.</p>
 <p>This achievement broke the back of my Sphinx. Having once reduce Lao Tze to 
   Qabalistic form, it was easy to translate the result into the language of philosophy. 
   I had already done much to create a new language based on English with the assistance 
   of a few technical terms borrowed from Asia, and above all by the use of a novel 
   conception of the idea of Number and algebraic and arithmetical proceedings, 
   to convey the results of spiritual experience to intelligent students.</p>
 <p>It is therefore not altogether without confidence that I present this translation 
   of the Tao Teh King to the public. I hope and believe that careful study of 
   the text, as elucidated by my commentary, will enable serious aspirants to the 
   hidden wisdom to understand with fair accuracy what Lao Tze taught. It must 
   however be laid to {10} heart that the essence of his system will inevitably 
   elude intellectual apprehension unless it be illuminated from above by actual 
   living experience of the truth. Such experience is only to be attained by unswerving 
   application to the practices which he advocates. Nor must the aspirant content 
   himself with the mere attainment of spiritual enlightenment, however sublime. 
   All such achievements are barren unless they be regarded as the means rather 
   than the end of spiritual progress, and allowed to infiltrate every detail of 
   the life, not only of the spirit, but of the senses. The Tao can never be known 
   until it interpret the most trivial actions of everyday routine. It is a fatal 
   mistake to discriminate between the spiritual importance of meditation and playing 
   golf. To do so is to create an internal conflict. "Let there be no difference 
   made among you between any one thing &amp; any other thing; for thereby there 
   cometh hurt." He who knows the Tao knows it to be the source of all things 
   soever; the most exalted spiritual ecstasy and the most trivial internal impression 
   are from our point of view equally illusions, worthless masks, which hide, with 
   grotesque painted pasteboard false and lifeless, {11} the living face of truth. 
   Yet, from another point of view, they are equally expressions of the ecstatic 
   genius of truth -- natural images of the reaction between the essence of onesself 
   and one's particular environment at the moment of their occurrence. They are 
   equally tokens of the Tao, by whom, in whom, and of whom, they are. To value 
   them for themselves is deny the Tao and to be lost in delusion. To despise them 
   is to deny the omnipresence of the Tao, and to suffer the illusion of sorrow. 
   To discriminate between them is to set up the accursèd dyad, to permit the insanity 
   of intellect, to overwhelm the intuition of truth, and to create civil war in 
   the consciousness.</p>
 <p>From 1908 to 1918, the Tao Teh King was my continual study. I constantly recommended 
   it to my friends as the supreme masterpiece of initiated wisdom, and I was as 
   constantly disappointed when they declared that it did not impress them, especially 
   as my preliminary descriptions of the book had aroused their keenest interest. 
   I thus came to see that the fault lay with Legge's translation, and I felt myself 
   impelled to undertake the {12} task of presenting Lao Tze in language informed 
   by the sympathetic understanding which initiation and spiritual experience had 
   conferred on me. During my Great Magical Retirement on Aesopus Island in the 
   Hudson River during the summer of 1918, I set myself to this work, but I discovered 
   immediately that I was totally incompetent. I therefore appealed to an Adept 
   named Amalantrah, with whom I was at that time in almost daily communion. He 
   came readily to my aid and exhibited to me a codex of the original, which conveyed 
   to me with absolute certitude the exact significance of the text. I was able 
   to divine without hesitation or doubt the precise manner in which Legge had 
   been deceived. He had translated the Chinese with singular fidelity, yet in 
   almost every verse the interpretation was altogether misleading. There was no 
   need to refer to the text from the point of view of scholarship. I had merely 
   to paraphrase his translation in the light of actual knowledge of the true significance 
   of the terms employed. Anyone who cares to take the trouble to compare the two 
   versions will be astounded to see how slight a remodeling of a paragraph is 
   sufficient to disperse the obstinate {13} obscurity of prejudice, and let loose 
   a fountain and a flood of living light, to kindle the gnarled prose of stolid 
   scholarship into the burgeoning blossom of lyrical flame.</p>
 <p>I completed my translation within three days, but during the last five years 
   I have constantly reconsidered every sentence. The manuscript has been lent 
   to a number of friends, scholars who have commended my work, and aspirants who 
   have appreciated its adequacy to present the spirit of the Master's teaching. 
   Those who had been disappointed with Legge's version were enthusiastic about 
   mine. This circumstance is in itself sufficient to assure me that Love's labour 
   has not been lost, and to fill me with enthusiastic confidence that the present 
   publication will abundantly contribute to the fulfillment of my True Will for 
   which I came to earth, and wring labour and sorrow to the utmost of which humanity 
   is capable, the Will to open the portals of spiritual attainment to my fellow 
   men, and bring them to the enjoyment of that realisation of Truth, beneath all 
   veils of temporal falsehood, which has enlightened mine eyes and filled my mouth 
   with song.</p>

 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER II</h3>
 <p align="center">THE ENERGY - SOURCE OF THE SELF. </p>
 <p>1. All men know that beauty and ugliness are correlatives, as are skill and 
   clumsiness; one implies and suggests the other. </p>
 <p>2. So also existence and non-existence pose the one the other; so also is it 
   with ease and difficulty, length and shortness; height and lowness. Also Musick 
   exists through harmony of opposites; time and space depend upon contraposition.</p>
 <p>3. By the use of this method, the sage can fulfil his will without action, 
   and utter his word without speech.</p>
 <p>4. All things arise without diffidence; they grow, and none interferes; they 
   change according to their natural order, without lust of result. The work is 
   accomplished; yet continueth in its orbit, without goal. This work is done unconsciously; 
   this is {2} why its energy is indefatigable.</p>
 <p>{3}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER III</h3>
 <p align="center">QUIETING FOLK. </p>
 <p>1. To reward merit is to stir up emulation; to prize rarities is to encourage 
   robbery; to display desirable things is to excite the disorder of covetousness.</p>
 <p>2. Therefore, the sage governeth men by keeping their minds and their bodies 
   at rest, contenting the one by emptiness, the other by fullness. He satisfieth 
   their desires, thus fulfilling their wills, and making them frictionless; and 
   he maketh them strong in body, to a similar end.</p>
 <p>3. He delivereth them from the restlessness of knowledge and the cravings of 
   discontent. As to those who have knowledge already, he teacheth them the way 
   of non-action. This being assured, there is no disorder in the world. {4}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER IV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE SPRING WITHOUT SOURCE. </p>
 <p>1. The Tao resembleth the emptiness of Space; to employ it, we must avoid creating 
   ganglia. Oh Tao, how vast art Thou, the Abyss of Abysses, thou Holy and Secret 
   Father of all Fatherhoods of Things!</p>
 <p>2. Let us make our sharpness blunt; let us loosen our complexes; let us tone 
   down our brightness to the general obscurity. Oh Tao, how still art thou, how 
   pure, continuous One beyond Heaven!</p>
 <p>3. This Tao hath no Father; it is beyond all other conceptions, higher than 
   the highest. {5}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER V</h3>
 <p align="center">THE FORMULA OF THE VACUUM. </p>
 <p>1. Heaven and earth proceed without motive, but casually in their order of 
   nature, dealing with all things carelessly, like used talismans. So also the 
   sages deal with their people, not exercising benevolence, but allowing the nature 
   of all to move without friction.</p>
 <p>2. The Space between heaven and earth is their breathing apparatus: Exhalation 
   is not exhaustion, but the complement of Inhalation, and this equally of that. 
   Speech exhausteth; guard thyself, therefore, maintaining the perfect freedom 
   of thy nature. {6}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER VI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE PERFECTING OF FORM. </p>
 <p>1. The Teh is the immortal enemy of the Tao, its feminine aspect. Heaven and 
   Earth issued from her Gate; this Gate is the Root of their World-Sycamore. Its 
   operation is of pure Joy and Love, and faileth never. {7}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER VII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE CONCEALMENT OF THE LIGHT. </p>
 <p>1. Heaven and Earth are mighty in continuance, because their work is delivered 
   from the lust of result.</p>
 <p>2. Thus also the sage, seeking not any goal, attaineth all things; he doth 
   not interfere in the affairs of his body, and so that body acteth without friction. 
   It is because he meddleth not with personal aims that these come to pass with 
   simplicity. {8}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER VIII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE NATURE OF PEACE. </p>
 <p>1. Admire thou the High Way of Water! Is not Water the soul of the life of 
   things, whereby they change? Yet it seeketh its level, and abideth content in 
   obscurity. So also it resembleth the Tao, in this Way thereof!</p>
 <p>2. The virtue of a house is to be well-placed; of the mind, to be at ease in 
   silence as of Space; of societies, to be well-disposed; of governments, to maintain 
   quietude; of work, to be skillfully performed; and of all motion, to be made 
   at the right time.</p>
 <p>3. Also it is the virtue of a man to abide in his place without discontent; 
   thus offendeth he no man. {9}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER IX</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WAY OF RETICENCE. </p>
 <p>1. Fill not a vessel, lest it spill in carrying. Meddle not with a sharpened 
   point by feeling it constantly, or it will soon become blunted.</p>
 <p>2. Gold and jade endanger the house of their possessor. Wealth and honors lead 
   to arrogance and envy, and bring ruin. Is thy way famous and thy name becoming 
   distinguished? Withdraw, thy work once done, into obscurity; this is the way 
   of Heaven. {10}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER X</h3>
 <p align="center">THINGS ATTAINABLE. </p>
 <p>1. When soul and body are in the bond of love, they can be kept together. By 
   concentration on the breath it is brought to perfect elasticity, and one becomes 
   as a babe. By purifying oneself from Samadhi one becomes whole.</p>
 <p>2. In his dealing with individuals and with society, let him move without lust 
   of result. In the management of his breath, let him be like the mother-bird. 
   Let his intelligence comprehend every quarter; but let his knowledge cease.</p>
 <p>3. Here is the Mystery of Virtue. It createth all and nourisheth all; yet it 
   doth not adhere to them; it operateth all, but knoweth not of it, nor proclaimeth 
   it; it directeth all, but without conscious control. {11}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE VALUE OF THE UNEXPRESSED. </p>
 <p>1. The thirty spokes join in their nave, that is one; yet the wheel dependeth 
   for use upon the hollow place for the axle. Clay is shapen to make vessels; 
   but the contained space is what is useful. Matter is therefore of use only to 
   mark the limits of the space which is the thing of real value. {12}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE EXTERNAL. </p>
 <p>1. The five colors film over Sight; The five sounds make Hearing dull; The 
   five flavours conceal Taste; occupation with motion and action bedevil Mind; 
   even so the esteem of rare things begetteth covetousness and disorder.</p>
 <p>2. The wise man seeketh therefore to content the actual needs of the people; 
   not to excite them by the sight of luxuries. He banneth these, and concentrateth 
   on those. {13}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XIII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE CONTEMPT FOR CIRCUMSTANCE. </p>
 <p>1. Favor and disgrace are equally to be shunned; honour and calamity to be 
   alike regarded as adhering to the personality.</p>
 <p>2. What is this which is written concerning favour and disgrace? Disgrace is 
   the fall from favour. He then that hath favour hath fear, and its loss begetteth 
   fear yet greater of a further fall. What is this which is written concerning 
   honour and calamity? It is this attachment to the body which maketh calamity 
   possible; for were one bodiless, what evil could befall him?</p>
 <p>3. Therefore let him that regardeth himself rightly administer also a kingdom; 
   and let him govern it who loveth it as another man loveth himself. {14}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XIV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE SHEWING-FORTH OF THE MYSTERY. </p>
 <p>1. We look at it, and see it not; though it is Omnipresent; and we name it 
   the Root-Balance.<br>
   We listen for it, and hear it not, though it is Omniscient; and we name it the 
   Silence.<br>
   We feel for it, and touch it not, though it is Omnipotent; and we name it the 
   Concealed.<br>
   These three Virtues hath it, yet we cannot describe it as consisting of them; 
   but, mingling them aright, we apprehend the One.</p>
 <p>2. Above, it shineth not; below, it is not dark. It moveth all continuously, 
   without Expression, returning into Naught. It is the Form of That which is beyond 
   Form; it is the Image of the Invisible; it is Change, and Without Limit.</p>
 <p>3. We confront it, and see not its Face; {15} we pursue it, and its Back is 
   hidden from us. Ah! but apply the Tao as in old Time to the work of the present; 
   know it as it was known in the Beginning; follow fervently the Thread of the 
   Tao. {16}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE APPEARANCE OF THE TRUE NATURE. </p>
 <p>1. The adepts of past ages were subtle and keen to apprehend this Mystery, 
   and their profundity was obscurity unto men. Since then they were not known, 
   let me declare their nature.</p>
 <p>2. To all seeming, they were fearful as men that cross a torrent in winter 
   flood; they were hesitating like a man in apprehension of them that are about 
   him; they were full of awe like a guest in a great house; they were ready to 
   disappear like ice in thaw; they were unassuming like unworked wood; they were 
   empty as a valley; and dull as the waters of a marsh.</p>
 <p>3. Who can clear muddy water? Stillness will accomplish this. Who can obtain 
   rest? Let motion continue equably, and it will itself be peace.</p>
 <p>4. The adepts of the Tao, conserving its way, seek not to be actively self-conscious. 
   By their emptiness of Self {17} they have no need to show their youth and perfection; 
   to appear old and imperfect is their privilege. {18}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XVI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WITHDRAWAL TO THE ROOT. </p>
 <p>1. Emptiness must be perfect, and Silence made absolute with tireless strength. 
   All things pass through the period of action; then they return to repose. They 
   grow, bud, blossom and fruit; then they return to the root. This return to the 
   root is this state which we name Silence; and this Silence is Witness of their 
   Fulfilment. </p>
 <p>2. This cycle is the universal law. To know it is the part of intelligence; 
   to ignore it bringeth folly of action, whereof the end is madness. To know it 
   bringeth understanding and peace; and these lead to the identification of the 
   Self with the Not-Self. This identification maketh man a king; and this kingliness 
   groweth unto godhood. That godhood beareth fruit in the mastery of the Tao. 
   Then the man, the Tao permeating him, endureth; and his bodily principles are 
   in harmony, {19} proof against decay, until the hour of his Change. {20}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XVII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE PURITY OF THE CURRENT. </p>
 <p>1. In the Age of Gold, the people were not conscious of their rulers; in the 
   Age of Silver, they loved them, with songs; in the Age of Brass, they feared 
   them; in the Age of Iron, they despised them. As the rulers lost confidence, 
   so also did the people lose confidence in them.</p>
 <p>2. How hesitating did they seem, the Lords of the Age of Gold, speaking with 
   deliberation, aware of the weight of their word! Thus they accomplished all 
   things with success; and the people deemed their well-being to be the natural 
   course of events. {21}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XVIII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE DECAY OF MANNERS. </p>
 <p>1. When men abandoned the Way of the Tao, benevolence and justice became necessary. 
   Then also was need of wisdom and cunning, and all fell into illusion. When harmony 
   ceased to prevail in the six spheres it was needful to govern them by manifesting 
   Sons.</p>
 <p>When the kingdoms and races became confused, loyal ministers had to appear. 
   {22}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XIX</h3>
 <p align="center">RETURNING TO THE PURITY OF THE CURRENT. </p>
 <p>1. If we forgot our statesmanship and our wisdom, it would be an hundred times 
   better for the people. If we forgot our benevolence and our justice, they would 
   become again like sons, folk of good will. If we forget our machines and our 
   business, there would be no knavery.</p>
 <p>2. These new methods despised the olden Way, inventing fine names to disguise 
   their baneness. But simplicity in the doing of the will of every man would put 
   an end to vain ambitions and desires. {23}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XX</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WITHDRAWAL FROM THE COMMON WAY. </p>
 <p>1. To forget learning is to end trouble. The smallest difference in words, 
   such as "yes" and "yea", can make endless controversy for 
   the scholar. Fearful indeed is death, since all men fear it; but the abyss of 
   questionings, shoreless and bottomless, is worse!</p>
 <p>2. Consider the profane man, how he preeneth, as if at feast, or gazing upon 
   Spring from a tower! But as for me, I am as one who yawneth, without any trace 
   of desire. I am like a babe before its first smile. I appear sad and forlorn, 
   like a man homeless. The profane man hath his need filled, ay, and more also. 
   For me, I seem to have lost all I had. My mind is as it were stupefied; it hath 
   no definite shape. The profane man looketh lively and keen-witted; I alone appear 
   blank in my mind. They seem eagerly critical; I appear careless and without 
   perception. I seem to be as one adrift upon the sea, with {24} no thought of 
   an harbor. The profane have each one his definite course of action; I alone 
   appear useless and uncomprehending, like a man from the border. Yea, thus I 
   differ from all other men: but my jewel is the All-Mother! {25}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE INFINITE WOMB. </p>
 <p>1. The sole source of energy is the Tao. Who may declare its nature? It is 
   beyond Sense, yet all form is hidden within it. It is beyond Sense, yet all 
   Perceptibles are hidden within it. It is beyond Sense, yet all Perceptibles 
   are hidden within it. It is beyond Sense, yet all Being is hidden within it. 
   This Being excites Perception, and the Word thereof. As it was in the beginning, 
   is now, and ever shall be, its Name operateth continuously, causing all to flow 
   in the cycle of Change, which is Love and Beauty. How do I know this? By my 
   comprehension of the Tao. {26}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE GUERDON OF MODESTY. </p>
 <p>1. The part becometh the whole. The curve becometh straight; the void becometh 
   full; the old becometh new. He who desireth little accomplisheth his Will with 
   ease; who desireth many things becometh distracted.</p>
 <p>2. Therefore, the sage concentrateth upon one Will, and it is as a light to 
   the whole world. Hiding himself, he shineth; withdrawing himself, he attracteth 
   notice; humbling himself, he is exalted; dissatisfied with himself, he gaineth 
   force to achieve his Will. Because he striveth not, no man may contend against 
   him.</p>
 <p>3. That is no idle saw of the men of old; "The part becometh the whole"; 
   it is the Canon of Perfection. {27}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXIII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE VOID OF NAUGHT. </p>
 <p>1. To keep silence is the mark of one who is acting in full accordance with 
   his Will. A fierce wind soon falleth; a storm-shower doth not last all day. 
   Yet Heaven and Earth cause these; and if they fail to make violence continue, 
   how much less can man abide in spasm of passion!</p>
 <p>2. With him that devoteth him to Tao, the devotees of Tao are in accord; so 
   also are the devotees of Teh, yea, even they who fail in seeking those are in 
   accord.</p>
 <p>3. So then his brothers in the Tao are joyful, attaining it; and his brothers 
   in the Teh are joyful, attaining it; and they who fail in seeking these are 
   joyful, partaking of it. But if he himself realize not the Tao with calm of 
   confidence, then they also appear lacking in confidence. {28}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXIV</h3>
 <p align="center">EVIL MANNERS. </p>
 <p>1. He who standeth a-tiptoe standeth not firm; he who maketh rigid his legs 
   walketh ill. He who preeneth himself shineth not; he who talketh positively 
   is vulgar; he who boastheth is refused acceptance; he who is wise in his own 
   conceit is thought inferior. Such attitudes, to him that hath the view given 
   by understanding the Tao, seem like garbage or like cancer, abhorrent to all. 
   They then who follow the Way do not admit them. {29}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXV</h3>
 <p align="center">IMAGES OF THE MYSTERY. </p>
 <p>1. Without Limit and Perfect, there is a Becoming, beyond Heaven and Earth. 
   It hath nor motion nor Form; it is alone, it changeth not; it extendeth all 
   ways; it hath no Adversary. It is like the All-Mother.</p>
 <p>2. I know not its Name, but I call it the Tao. Moreover, I exert myself, and 
   call it Vastness.</p>
 <p>3. Vastness, the Becoming! Becoming, it flieth afar. Afar, it draweth near. 
   Vast is this Tao; Heaven also is Vast; Earth is vast; and the Holy King is vast 
   also. In the Universe are Four Vastnesses, and of these is the Holy King.</p>
 <p>4. Man followeth the formula of Earth; Earth followeth that of Heaven, and 
   Heaven that of the Tao. The formula of the Tao is its own Nature. {30}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXVI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE NATURE OF MASS. </p>
 <p>1. Mass is the fulcrum of mobility; stillness is the father of motion.</p>
 <p>2. Therefore the sage King, though he travel afar, remaineth near his supplies. 
   Though opportunity tempt him, he remaineth quietly in proper disposition, indifferent. 
   Should the master of an host of chariots bear himself frivolously? If he attack 
   without support, he loseth his base; if he become a raider, he forfeiteth his 
   throne. {31}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXVII</h3>
 <p align="center">SKILL IN THE METHOD. </p>
 <p>1. The experienced traveler concealeth his tracks; the clever speaker giveth 
   no chance to the critic; the skilled mathematician useth no abacus; the ingenious 
   safesmith baffleth the burglar without the use of bolts, and the cunning binder 
   without ropes and knots. So also the sage, skilled in man-emancipation-craft, 
   useth all men; understanding the value of everything, he rejecteth nothing. 
   This is called the Occult Regimen. </p>
 <p>2. The adept is then master to the zelator, and the zelator assisteth and honoreth 
   the adept. Yet unless these relations were manifest, even the most intelligent 
   observer might be perplexed as to which was which. This is called the Crown 
   of Mystery. {32}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXVIII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE RETURN TO SIMPLICITY. </p>
 <p>1. Balance thy male strength with thy female weakness and thou shalt attract 
   all things, as the ocean absorbeth all rivers; for thou shalt formulate the 
   excellence of the Child eternal, simple, and perfect.</p>
 <p>Knowing the light, remain in the Dark. Manifest not thy Glory, but thine obscurity. 
   Clothed in this Child-excellence eternal, thou hast attained the Return of the 
   First State. Knowing splendour of Fame, cling to Obloquy and Infamy; then shalt 
   thou remain as in the Valley to which flow all waters, the lodestone to fascinate 
   all men. Yea, they shall hail in thee this Excellence, eternal, simple and perfect, 
   of the Child.</p>
 <p>2. The raw material, wrought into form, produceth vessels. So the sage King 
   formulateth his Wholeness in divers Offices; and his Law is without violence 
   or constraint. {33}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXIX</h3>
 <p align="center">REFRAINING FROM ACTION. </p>
 <p>1. He that, desiring a kingdom, exerteth himself to obtain it, will fail. A 
   Kingdom is of the nature of spirit, and yieldeth not to activity. He who graspeth 
   it, destroyeth it; he who gaineth it, loseth it.</p>
 <p>2. The wheel of nature revolveth constantly; the last becometh first, and the 
   first last; hot things grow cold, and cold things hot; weakness overcometh strength; 
   things gained are lost anon. Hence the wise man avoideth effort, desire and 
   sloth. {34}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXX</h3>
 <p align="center">A WARNING AGAINST WAR. </p>
 <p>1. If a king summon to his aid a Master of the Tao, let Him not advise recourse 
   to arms. Such action certainly bringeth the corresponding reaction.</p>
 <p>2. Where armies are, are weeds. Bad harvests follow great hosts.</p>
 <p>3. The good general striketh decisively, once and for all. He does not risk 
   by overboldness. He striketh, but doth not vaunt his victory. He striketh according 
   to strict law of necessity, not from desire of victory.</p>
 <p>4. Things become strong and ripe, then age. This is discord with the Tao; and 
   what is not at one with the Tao soon cometh to an end. {35}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXI</h3>
 <p align="center">COMPOSING QUARREL. </p>
 <p>1. Arms, though they be beautiful, are of ill omen, abominable to all created 
   beings. They who have the Tao love not their use.</p>
 <p>2. The place of honour is on the right in wartime; so thinketh the man of distinction. 
   Sharp weapons are ill-omened, unworthy of such a man; he useth them only in 
   necessity. He valueth peace and ease, desireth not violence of victory. To desire 
   victory is to desire the death of men; and to desire that is to fail to propitiate 
   the people.</p>
 <p>3. At feasts, the left hand is the high seat; at funerals, the right. The second 
   in command of the army leadeth the left wing, the commander-in-chief, the right 
   wing; it is as if the battle were a rite of mourning! He that hath slain most 
   men should weep for them most bitterly; so then the place of the victor is assigned 
   to him with philosophical propriety. {36}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WISDOM OF TEH. </p>
 <p>1. The All-Tao hath no name.</p>
 <p>2. It is That Minute Point yet the whole world dare not contend against him 
   that hath it. Did a lord or king gain it and guard it, all men would obey him 
   of their own accord.</p>
 <p>3. Heaven and Earth combining under its spell, shed forth dew, extending throughout 
   all things of its own accord, without man's interference.</p>
 <p>4. Tao, in its phase of action, hath a name. Then men can comprehend it; when 
   they do this, there is no more risk of wrong or ill-success.</p>
 <p>5. As the great rivers and the oceans are to the valley streams, so is the 
   Tao to the whole universe. {37}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXIII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE DISCRIMINATION (VIVEKA) OF TEH. </p>
 <p>1. He who understandeth others understandeth Two; but he who understandeth 
   himself understandeth One. He who conquereth others is strong; but he who conquereth 
   himself is stronger yet.<br>
   Contentment is riches; and continuous action is Will.</p>
 <p>2. He that adapteth himself perfectly to his environment, continueth for long; 
   he who dieth without dying, liveth for ever. {38}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXIV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE METHOD OF ATTAINMENT. </p>
 <p>1. The Tao is immanent; it extendeth to the right hand as to the left.</p>
 <p>2. All things derive from it their being; it createth them, and all comply 
   with it. Its work is done, and it proclaimeth it not. It is the ornament of 
   all things, yet it claimeth not fief of them; there is nothing so small that 
   it inhabiteth not, and informeth it.</p>
 <p>All things return without knowledge of the Cause thereof; there is nothing 
   so great that it inhabiteth not, and informeth it.</p>
 <p>3. In this manner also may the Sage perform his Works. It is by not thrusting 
   himself forward that he winneth to his success. {39}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE GOOD WILL OF THE TEH. </p>
 <p>1. The whole world is drawn to him that hath the likeness of the Tao. Men flock 
   unto him, and suffer no ill, but gain repose, find peace, enjoy all ease.</p>
 <p>2. Sweet sounds and cates lure the traveler from his way. But the Word of the 
   Tao; though it appear harsh and insipid, unworthy to hearken or to behold; hath 
   his use all inexhaustible. {40}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXVI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE HIDING OF THE LIGHT. </p>
 <p>1. In order to draw breath, first empty the lungs; to weaken another, first 
   strengthen him; to overthrow another, first exalt him; to despoil another, first 
   load him with gifts; this is called the Occult Regimen.</p>
 <p>2. The soft conquereth the hard; the weak pulleth down the strong.</p>
 <p>3. The fish that leaveth ocean is lost; the method of government must be concealed 
   from the people. {41}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXVII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE RIGHT USE OF GOVERNMENT. </p>
 <p>1. The Tao proceedeth by its own nature, doing nothing; therefore there is 
   no doing which it comprehendeth not.</p>
 <p>2. If kings and princes were to govern in this manner, all things would operate 
   aright by their own motion.</p>
 <p>3. If this transmutation were my object, I should call it Simplicity. Simplicity 
   hath no name nor purpose; silently and at ease all things go well. {42}</p>
 <h2 align="center">PART II</h2>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXVIII</h3>
 <p align="center">CONCERNING THE TEH. </p>
 <p>1. Those who possessed perfectly the powers did not manifest them, and so they 
   preserved them. Those who possessed them imperfectly feared to lose them, and 
   so lost them.</p>
 <p>2. The former did nothing, nor had need to do. The latter did, and had need 
   to do.</p>
 <p>3. Those who possessed benevolence exercised it, and had need it; so also was 
   it with them who possessed justice.</p>
 <p>4. Those who possessed the conventions displayed them; and when men would not 
   agree, they made ready to fight them.</p>
 <p>5. Thus, when the Tao was lost, the Magick Powers appeared; then, by successive 
   degradations, came Benevolence, Justice, Convention. {43}</p>
 <p>6. Now convention is the shadow of loyalty and good will, and so the herald 
   of disorder. Yea, even Understanding is but a Blossom of the Tao, and foreshadoweth 
   Stupidity.</p>
 <p>7. So then the Tao-Man holdeth to Mass, and avoideth Motion; he is attached 
   to the Root, not to the flower. He leaveth the one, and cleaveth to the other. 
   {44}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XXXIX</h3>
 <p align="center">THE LAW OF THE BEGINNING. </p>
 <p>1. These things have possessed the Tao from the beginning: Heaven, clear and 
   shining; Earth, steady and easy; Spirits, mighty in Magick; Vehicles, overflowing 
   with Joy; all that hath life; and the rulers of men. All these derive their 
   essence from the Tao.</p>
 <p>2. Without the Tao, Heaven would dissolve Earth disrupt, Spirits become impotent; 
   Vehicles empty; living things would perish and rulers lose their power.</p>
 <p>3. The root of grandeur is humility, and the strength of exaltation in its 
   base. Thus rulers speak of themselves as "Fatherless," "Virtueless,' 
   "Unworthy," proclaiming by this that their Glory is in their shame. 
   So also the virtue of a Chariot is not any of the parts of a Chariot, if they 
   be numbered. They do not seek to appear fine like jade, but inconspicuous like 
   common stone. {45}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XL</h3>
 <p align="center">OMITTING UTILITY. </p>
 <p>1. The Tao proceeds by correlative curves, and its might is in weakness.</p>
 <p>2. All things arose from the Teh, and the Teh budded from the Tao. {46}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE IDENTITY OF THE DIFFERENTIAL. </p>
 <p>1. The best students, learning of the Tao, set to work earnestly to practice 
   the Way. Mediocre students now cherish it, now let it go.</p>
 <p>The worst students mock at it. Were it not thus mocked, it were unworthy to 
   be Tao.</p>
 <p>2. Thus spake the makers of Saws: the Tao at its brightest is obscure. Who 
   advanceth in that Way, retireth. Its smooth Way is rough. Its summit is a valley. 
   Its beauty is ugliness. Its wealth is poverty. Its virtue, vice. Its stability 
   is change. Its form is without form. Its fullness is vacancy. Its utterance 
   is silence. Its reality is illusion.</p>
 <p>3. Nameless and imperceptible is the Tao; but it informeth and perfecteth all 
   things. {47}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE VEILS OF THE TAO. </p>
 <p>1. The Tao formulated the One.<br>
   The One exhaled the Two.<br>
   The Two were parents of the Three.<br>
   The Three were parents of all things.<br>
   All things pass from Obscurity to Manifestation, inspired harmoniously by the 
   Breath of the Void.</p>
 <p>2. Men do not like to be fatherless, virtueless, unworthy: yet rulers describe 
   themselves by these names. Thus increase bringeth decrease to some, and decrease 
   bringeth increase to others.</p>
 <p>3. Others have taught thus; I consent to it. Violent men and strong die not 
   by natural death. This fact is the foundation of my law. {48}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLIII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE COSMIC METHOD. </p>
 <p>1. The softest substance hunteth down the hardest; the unsubstantial penetrateth 
   where there is no opening. Here is the Virtue of Inertia.</p>
 <p>2. Few are they who attain: whose speech is Silence, whose Work is Inertia. 
   {49}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLIV</h3>
 <p align="center">MONITORIAL. </p>
 <p>1. What shall it profit a man if he gain fame or wealth, and lose his life?</p>
 <p>2. If a man cling to fame or wealth, he risketh what is worth more.</p>
 <p>3. Be content, not fearing disgrace. Act not, and risk not criticism. Thus 
   live thou long, without alarm. {50}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE OVERFLOWING OF TEH. </p>
 <p>1. Despise thy masterpieces; thus renew the vigor of thy creation.<br>
   Deem thy fullness emptiness; thus shall thy fullness never be empty.<br>
   Let the straight appear crooked to thee, thy Craft clumsiness; thy Musick discord.</p>
 <p>2. Exercise moderateth cold; stillness heat. To be pure and to keep silence, 
   is the True Law of all that are beneath Heaven. {51}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLVI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WITHDRAWAL FROM AMBITION. </p>
 <p>1. When the Tao beareth away on Earth, men put swift horses to night-carts. 
   When it is neglected, they breed chargers in the border marches.</p>
 <p>2. There is no evil worse than ambition; no misery worse than discontent; no 
   crime greater than greed. Content of mind is peace and satisfaction eternal. 
   {52}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLVII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE VISION OF THE DISTANT. </p>
 <p>1. One need not pass his threshold to comprehend all that is under Heaven, 
   nor to look out from his lattice to behold the Tao Celestial. Nay! but the farther 
   a man goeth, the less he knoweth.</p>
 <p>2. The sages acquired their knowledge without travel; they named all things 
   aright without beholding them; and, acting without aim, fulfilled their Wills. 
   {53}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLVIII</h3>
 <p align="center">OBLIVION OVERCOMING KNOWLEDGE. </p>
 <p>1. The scholar seeketh daily increase of knowing; the sage of Tao daily decrease 
   of doing.</p>
 <p>2. He decreaseth it, again and again, until he doth no act with the lust of 
   result. Having attained this Inertia all accomplisheth itself.</p>
 <p>3. He who attracteth to himself all that is under Heaven doth so without effort. 
   He who maketh effort is not able to attract it. {54}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER XLIX</h3>
 <p align="center">THE ADAPTABILITY OF THE TEH. </p>
 <p>1. The wise man hath no fixed principle; he adapteth his mind to his environment.</p>
 <p>2. To the good I am good, and to the evil I am good also; thus all become good. 
   To the true I am true, and to the false I am true; thus all become true. </p>
 <p>3. The sage appeareth hesitating to the world, because his mind is detached. 
   Therefore the people look and listen to him, as his children; and thus doth 
   he shepherd them. {53}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER L</h3>
 <p align="center">THE ESTIMATION OF LIFE. </p>
 <p>1. Man cometh into life, and returneth again into death.</p>
 <p>2. Three men in ten conserve life; three men in ten pursue death.</p>
 <p>3. Three men also in ten desire to live, but their acts hasten their journey 
   to the house of death. Why is this? Because of their efforts to preserve life.</p>
 <p>4. But this I have heard. He that is wise in the economy of his life, whereof 
   he is warden for a season, journeyeth with no need to avoid the tiger or the 
   rhinoceros, and goeth uncorsleted among the warriors with no fear of sword or 
   lance. The rhinoceros findeth in him no place vulnerable to its horn, the tiger 
   to its claws, the weapon to its point. Why is this? Because there is no house 
   of death in his whole body. {56}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE TEH AS THE NURSE. </p>
 <p>1. All things proceed from the Tao, and are sustained by its forth-flowing 
   virtue. Every one taketh form according to his nature, and is perfect, each 
   in his particular Way. Therefore, each and every one of them glorify the Tao, 
   and worship its forth-flowing Virtue.</p>
 <p>2. This glorifying of the Tao, this worship of the Teh, is constantly spontaneous, 
   and not by appointment of Law.</p>
 <p>3. Thus the Tao buddeth them out, nurtureth them, developeth them, sustaineth 
   them, perfecteth them, ripeneth them, upholdeth them, and reabsorbeth them.</p>
 <p>4. It buddeth them forth, and claimeth not lordship over them; it is overseer 
   of their changes, and boasteth not of his puissance; perfecteth them, and interfereth 
   not with their Ways; this is called the Mystery of its Virtue. {57}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WITHDRAWAL INTO THE SILENCE. </p>
 <p>1. The Tao buddeth forth all things under Heaven; it is the Mother of all.</p>
 <p>2. Knowing the Mother, we may know her offspring. He that knoweth his Mother, 
   and abideth in Her nature, remaineth in surety all his days.</p>
 <p>3. With the mouth closed, and the Gates of Breath controlled, he remaineth 
   at ease all his days. With the mouth open, and the Breath directed to outward 
   affairs, he hath no surety all his days.</p>
 <p>4. To perceive that Minute Point is True Vision; to maintain the Soft and Gentle 
   is True Strength.</p>
 <p>5. Employing harmoniously the Light Within so that it returneth to its Origin, 
   one guardeth even one's body from evil, and keepeth Silence before all men. 
   {58}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LIII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WITNESS OF GREED. </p>
 <p>1. Were I discovered by men, and charged with government, my first would be 
   lest I should become proud.</p>
 <p>2. The true Path is level and smooth; but men love by-paths.</p>
 <p>3. They adorn their courts, but they neglect their fields, and leave their 
   storehouses empty. They wear elaborate and embroidered robes; they gird themselves 
   with sharp swords; they eat and drink with luxury; they heap up goods; they 
   are thievish and vainglorious. All this is opposite to the Way of Tao. {59}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LIV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WITNESS OF WISDOM. </p>
 <p>1. If a man plant according to the Tao it will never be uprooted; if he thus 
   gather, it will never be lost. His sons and his son's sons, one following another, 
   shall honour the shrine of their ancestor.</p>
 <p>2. The Tao, applied to oneself, strengtheneth the Body, to the family, bringeth 
   wealth; to the district, prosperity; to the state, great fortune. Let it be 
   the Law of the Kingdom, and all men will increase in virtue.</p>
 <p>3. Thus we observe its effect in every case, as to the person, the family, 
   the district, the state, and the kingdom.</p>
 <p>4. How do I know that this is thus universal under Heaven?<br>
   By experience. {60}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LV </h3>
 <p align="center">THE SPELL OF THE MYSTERY. </p>
 <p>1. He that hath the Magick powers of the Tao is like a young child. Insects 
   will not sting him or beasts or birds of prey attack him.</p>
 <p>2. The young child's bones are tender and its sinews are elastic, but its grasp 
   is firm. It knoweth nothing of the Union of Man and Woman, yet its Organ may 
   be excited. This is because of its natural perfection. It will cry all day long 
   without becoming hoarse, because of the harmony of its being.</p>
 <p>3. He who understandeth this harmony knoweth the mystery of the Tao, and becometh 
   a True Sage. All devices for inflaming life, and increasing the vital Breath, 
   by mental effort are evil and factitious.</p>
 <p>4. Things become strong, then age. This is in discord with the Tao, and what 
   is not at one with the Tao soon cometh to an end. {61}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LVI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE EXCELLENCE OF THE MYSTERY. </p>
 <p>1. Who knoweth the Tao keepeth Silence; he who babbleth knoweth it not.</p>
 <p>2. Who knoweth it closeth his mouth and controlleth the Gates of his Breath. 
   He will make his sharpness blunt; he will loosen his complexes; he will tone 
   down his brightness to the general obscurity. This is called the Secret of Harmony.</p>
 <p>3. He cannot be insulted either by familiarity or aversion; he is immune to 
   ideas of gain or loss, of honour or disgrace; he is the true man, unequalled 
   under Heaven. {62}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LVII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE TRUE INFLUENCE. </p>
 <p>1. One may govern a state by restriction; weapons may be used with skill and 
   cunning; but one acquireth true command only by freedom, given and taken.</p>
 <p>2. How am I aware of this? By experience that to multiply restrictive laws 
   in the kingdom impoverisheth the people; the use of machines causeth disorder 
   in state and race alike. The more men use skill and cunning, the more machines 
   there are; and the more laws there are, the more felons there are.</p>
 <p>3. A wise man has said this: I will refrain from doing, and the people will 
   act rightly of their own accord; I will love Silence, and the people will instinctively 
   turn to perfection; I will take no measures, and the people will enjoy true 
   wealth; I will restrain ambition, and the people will attain simplicity. {63}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LVIII</h3>
 <p align="center">ADAPTATION TO ENVIRONMENT. </p>
 <p>1. The government that exerciseth the least care serveth the people best; that 
   which meddleth with everybody's business worketh all manner of harm. Sorrow 
   and joy are bedfellows; who can divine the final result of either?</p>
 <p>2. Shall we avoid restriction? Yea; restriction distorteth nature, so that 
   even what seemeth good in it is evil. For how long have men suffered from misunderstanding 
   of this.</p>
 <p>3. The wise man is foursquare, and avoideth aggression; his corners do not 
   injure others. He moveth in a straight line and turneth not aside therefrom; 
   he is brilliant but doth not blind with his brightness. {64}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LIX</h3>
 <p align="center">WARDING THE TAO. </p>
 <p>1. To balance our earthly nature and cultivate our heavenly nature, tread the 
   Middle Path.</p>
 <p>2. This Middle Path alone leadeth to the Timely Return to the True Nature. 
   This Timely Return resulteth from the constant gathering of Magick Powers. With 
   that Gathering cometh Control. This Control we know to be without Limit and 
   he who knoweth the Limitless may rule the state.</p>
 <p>3. He who possesseth the Tao continueth long. He is like a plant with well-set 
   roots and strong stems. Thus it secureth long continuance of its life. {65}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LX </h3>
 <p align="center">THE DUTY OF GOVERNMENT. </p>
 <p>1. The government of a kingdom is like the cooking of fish.</p>
 <p>2. If the kingdom be ruled according to the Tao, the spirits of our ancestors 
   will not manifest their Teh. These spirits have this Teh, but will not turn 
   it against men. It is able to hurt men; so also is the Wise King; but he doth 
   not.</p>
 <p>3. When these powers are in accord, their Good Will produceth the Teh, endowing 
   the people therewith. {66}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXI</h3>
 <p align="center">THE MODESTY OF THE TEH. </p>
 <p>1. A state becometh powerful when it resembleth a great river, deep-seated; 
   to it tend all the small streams under Heaven.</p>
 <p>2. It is as with the female, that conquereth the male by her Silence. Silence 
   is a form of Gravity.</p>
 <p>3. Thus a great state attracteth small states by meeting their views, and small 
   states attract the great state by revering its eminence. In the first case this 
   Silence gaineth supporters; in the second, favour.</p>
 <p>4. The great state uniteth men and nurtureth them; the small state wisheth 
   the good will of the great, and offereth service; thus each gaineth its advantage. 
   But the great state must keep Silence. {67}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WORKINGS OF THE TAO. </p>
 <p>1. The Tao is the most exalted of all things. It is the ornament of the good, 
   and the protection and purification of the evil.</p>
 <p>2. Its words are the fountain of honour, and its deeds the engine of achievement. 
   It is present even in evil.</p>
 <p>3. Though the Son of Heaven were enthroned with his three Dukes appointed to 
   serve him, and he were offered a round symbol- of-rank as great as might fill 
   the hands, with a team of horses to follow, this gift were not to be matched 
   against the Tao, which might be offered by the humblest of men.</p>
 <p>4. Why did they of old time set such store by the Tao? Because he that sought 
   it might find it, and because it was the Purification from all evil. Therefore 
   did all men under Heaven esteem it the most exalted of all things. {68}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXIII</h3>
 <p align="center">FORETHOUGHT AT THE OUTSET. </p>
 <p>1. Act without lust of result; work without anxiety; taste without attachment 
   to flavour; esteem small things great and few things many; repel violence with 
   gentleness.</p>
 <p>2. Do great things while they are yet small, hard things while they are yet 
   easy; for all things, how great or hard soever, have a beginning when they are 
   little and easy. So thus the wise man accomplisheth the greatest tasks without 
   undertaking anything important.</p>
 <p>3. Who undertaketh thoughtlessly is certain to fail in attainment; who estimateth 
   things easy findeth them hard. The wise man considereth even easy things hard, 
   so that even hard things are easy to him. {69}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXIV</h3>
 <p align="center">ATTENDING TO DETAILS. </p>
 <p>1. It is easy to grasp what is not yet in motion, to withstand what is not 
   yet manifest, to break what is not yet compact, to disperse what is not yet 
   coherent. Act against things before they become visible; attend to order before 
   disorder ariseth.</p>
 <p>2. The tree which filleth the embrace grew from a small shoot; the tower nine-storied 
   rose from a low foundation; the ten-day journey began with a single step.</p>
 <p>3. He who acteth worketh harm; he who graspeth findeth it a slip. The wise 
   man acteth not, so worketh no harm; he doth not grasp, and so doth not let go. 
   Men often ruin their affairs on the eve of success, because they are not as 
   prudent at the end as in the beginning.</p>
 <p>4. The wise man willeth what others do not will, and valueth not things rare. 
   He learneth what others learn not, and gathered up what they despise. Thus he 
   is in accord with the natural course of events, and is not overbold in action. 
   {70}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE PURITY OF THE TEH. </p>
 <p>1. They of old time that were skilled in the Tao sought not to enlighten the 
   people, but to keep them simple.</p>
 <p>2. The difficulty of government is the vain knowledge of the people. To use 
   cleverness in government is to scourge the kingdom; to use simplicity is to 
   anoint it.</p>
 <p>3. Know these things, and make them thy law and thine example. To possess this 
   Law is the Secret Perfection of rule. Profound and Extended is this Perfection; 
   he that possesseth it is indeed contrary to the rest, but he attracteth them 
   to full accordance. {71}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXVI</h3>
 <p align="center">PUTTING ONE'S SELF LAST. </p>
 <p>1. The oceans and the rivers attract the streams by their skill in being lower 
   than they; thus are they masters thereof. So the Wise Man, to be above men, 
   speaketh lowly; and to precede them acteth with humility.</p>
 <p>2. Thus, though he be above them, they feel no burden; nor, though he precede 
   them, do they feel insulted.</p>
 <p>3. So then do all men delight to honour him, and grow not weary of him. He 
   contendeth not against any man; therefore no man is able to contend against 
   him. {72}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXVII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE THREE JEWELS. </p>
 <p>1. They say that while this Tao of mine is great, yet it is inferior. This 
   is the proof of its greatness. If it were like anything else, its smallness 
   would have long been known.</p>
 <p>2. I have three jewels of price whereto I cleave; gentleness, economy, and 
   humility.</p>
 <p>3. That gentleness maketh me courageous, that economy generous, that humility 
   honoured. Men of today abandon gentleness for violence, economy for extravagance, 
   humility for pride: this is death.</p>
 <p>4. Gentleness bringeth victory in fight; and holdeth its ground with assurance. 
   Heaven wardeth the gentle man by that same virtue. {73}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXVIII</h3>
 <p align="center">ASSIMILATING ONE'S SELF TO HEAVEN. </p>
 <p>1. He that is skilled in war maketh no fierce gestures; the most efficient 
   fighter bewareth of anger. He who conquereth refraineth from engaging in battle; 
   he whom men most willingly obey continueth silently with his Work. So it is 
   said: "He is mighty who fighteth not; he ruleth who uniteth with his subjects; 
   he shineth whose will is that of Heaven." {74}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXIX</h3>
 <p align="center">THE USE OF THE MYSTERIOUS WAY. </p>
 <p>1. A great strategist saith: "I dare not take the offensive. I prefer 
   the defensive. I dare not advance an inch; I prefer to retreat a foot." 
   Place therefore the army where there is no army; prepare for action where there 
   is no engagement; strike where there is no conflict; advance against the enemy 
   where the enemy is not.</p>
 <p>2. There is no error so great as to engage in battle without sufficient force. 
   To do so is to risk losing the gentleness which is beyond price. Thus when the 
   lines actually engage, he who regretteth the necessity is the victor. {75}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXX</h3>
 <p align="center">THE DIFFICULTY OF RIGHT APPREHENSION. </p>
 <p>1. My words are easy to understand and to perform; but is there anyone in the 
   world who can understand them and perform them?</p>
 <p>2. My words derive from a creative and universal Principle, in accord with 
   the One Law. Men, not knowing these, understand me not.</p>
 <p>3. Few are they that understand me; therefore am I the more to be valued. The 
   Wise Man weareth sack-cloth, but guardeth his jewel in his bosom. {76}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXI </h3>
 <p align="center">THE DISTEMPER OF KNOWLEDGE. </p>
 <p>1. To know, yet to know nothing, is the highest; not to know, yet to pretend 
   to knowledge, is a distemper.</p>
 <p>2. Painful is this distemper; therefore we shun it. The wise man hath it not. 
   Knowing it to be bound up with Sorrow, he putteth it away from him. {77}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXII </h3>
 <p align="center">CONCERNING LOVE OF SELF. </p>
 <p>1. When men fear not that which is to be feared, that which they fear cometh 
   upon them.</p>
 <p>2. Let them not live, without thought, the superficial life. Let them not weary 
   of the Spring of Life!</p>
 <p>3. By avoiding the superficial life, this weariness cometh not upon them.</p>
 <p>4. These things the wise man knoweth, not showeth: he loveth himself, without 
   isolating his value. He accepteth the former and rejecteth the latter. {78}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXIII </h3>
 <p align="center">ESTABLISHING THE LAW OF FREEDOM. </p>
 <p>1. One man, daring, is executed; another, not daring, liveth. It would seem 
   as if the one course were profitable and the other detrimental. Yet when Heaven 
   smiteth a man, who shall assign the cause thereof? Therefore the sage is diffident.</p>
 <p>2. The Tao of Heaven contendeth not, yet it overcometh; it is silent, yet its 
   need is answered; it summoneth none, but all men come to it of their free will. 
   Its method is quietness, yet its will is efficient. Large are the meshes of 
   Heaven's Net; wide open, yet letting none escape. {79}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXIV </h3>
 <p align="center">A RESTRAINT OF MISUNDERSTANDING. </p>
 <p>1. The people have no fear of death; why then seek to awe them by the threat 
   of death? If the people feared death and I could put to death evil-doers, who 
   would dare to offend?</p>
 <p>2. There is one appointed to inflict death. He who would usurp that position 
   resembleth a hewer of wood doing the work of a carpenter. Such an one, presumptuous, 
   will be sure to cut his own hands. {80}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXV</h3>
 <p align="center">THE INJURY OF GREED. </p>
 <p>1. The people suffer hunger because of the weight of taxation imposed by their 
   rulers. This is the cause of famine.</p>
 <p>2. The people are difficult to govern because their rulers meddle with them. 
   This is the cause of bad government.</p>
 <p>3. The people welcome death because the toil of living is intolerable. This 
   is why they esteem death lightly. In such a state of insecurity it is better 
   to ignore the question of living than to set store by it. {81}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXVI</h3>
 <p align="center">A WARNING AGAINST RIGIDITY. </p>
 <p>1. At the birth of man, he is elastic and weak; at his death, rigid and unyielding. 
   This is the common law; trees also, in their youth, are tender and supple; in 
   their decay, hard and dry.</p>
 <p>2. So then rigidity and hardness are the stigmata of death; elasticity and 
   adaptability, of life.</p>
 <p>3. He then who putteth forth strength is not victorious; even as a strong tree 
   filleth the embrace.</p>
 <p>4. Thus the hard and rigid have the inferior place, the soft and elastic the 
   superior. {82}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXVII</h3>
 <p align="center">THE WAY OF HEAVEN. </p>
 <p>1. The Tao of Heaven is likened to the bending of a bow, whereby the high part 
   is brought down, and the low part raised up. The extreme is diminished, and 
   the middle increased.</p>
 <p>2. This is the Way of Heaven, to remove excess, and to supplement insufficiency. 
   Not so is the way of man, who taketh away from him that hath not to give to 
   him that hath already excess.</p>
 <p>3. Who can employ his own excess to the weal of all under Heaven? Only he that 
   possesseth the Tao.</p>
 <p>4. So the Wise Man acteth without lust of result; achieveth and boasteth not; 
   he willeth not to proclaim his greatness. {83}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXVIII</h3>
 <p align="center">A CREED. </p>
 <p>1. Nothing in the world is more elastic and yielding than water; yet it is 
   preeminent to dissolve things rigid and resistant; there is nothing which can 
   match it.</p>
 <p>2. All men know that the soft overcometh the hard, and the weak conquereth 
   the strong; but none are able to use this law in action.</p>
 <p>3. A Wise Man hath said: "He that taketh on the burden of the state is 
   a demigod worthy of sacrificial worship; and the true King of a people is he 
   that undertaketh the weight of their sorrows."</p>
 <p>4. Truth appeareth paradox. {84}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXIX</h3>
 <p align="center">TRUTH IN COVENANT. </p>
 <p>1. When enemies are reconciled, there is always an aftermath of illwill. How 
   can this be useful?</p>
 <p>2. Therefore, the Wise Man, while he keepeth his part of the record of a transaction, 
   doth not insist on its prompt execution. He who hath the Teh considereth the 
   situation from all sides, while he who hath it not seeketh only to benefit himself.</p>
 <p>3. In the Tao of Heaven, there is no distinction of persons in its love; but 
   it is for the True Man to claim it. {85}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXX</h3>
 <p align="center">ISOLATION. </p>
 <p>1. In a little kingdom of few people it should be the order that though there 
   were men able to do the work of ten men or five score, they should not be employed. 
   Though the people regarded death as sorrowful, yet they should not wish to go 
   elsewhere.</p>
 <p>2. They should have boats and wagons, yet no necessity to travel; corslets 
   and weapons, yet no occasion to fight. </p>
 <p>3. For communication they should use knotted cords.</p>
 <p>4. They should deem their food sweet, their clothes beautiful, their houses 
   homes, their customs delightful.</p>
 <p>5. There should be another state within view, so that its fowls and dogs should 
   be heard; yet to old age, even to death, the people should hold no traffic with 
   it. {86}</p>
 <h3 align="center">CHAPTER LXXXI </h3>
 <p align="center">THE SHEWING-FORTH OF SIMPLICITY. </p>
 <p>1. True speech is not elegant; elaborate speech is not truth. Those who know 
   do not argue; the argumentative are without knowledge. Those who have assimilated 
   are not learned; those who are gross with learning have not assimilated.</p>
 <p>2. The Wise Man doth not hoard. The more he giveth, the more he hath; the more 
   he watereth, the more is he watered himself.</p>
 <p>3. The Tao of Heaven is like an Arrow, yet it woundeth not; and the Wise Man, 
   in all his Works, maketh no contention. {87}</p>
