   DE VIRTUTE CHIRURGICA.</h2>
 <p>Know that the Cult of the Slave-Gods is a Device of those Black Brothers. All 
   that stagnateth is thereof, and thence cometh not Stability, but Putrefaction. 
   Endure not thou the static Standards either in Thought or in Action Resist not 
   even the Change that is the Rottenness of Choronzon, but rather speed it, so 
   that the elements may combine by Love under Will. Since the Black Brothers and 
   their Cults set hemselves against Change, do thou break them asunder. Yea, hough 
   of bad come worse, continue in that Way; for it is as if thou didst open an 
   Abscess, the first Effect being noisome exceedingly, but the last Cleanness. 
   Heed not then, whoso crieth Anarchy, and Immorality, and Heresy against thee, 
   and feareth to destroy Abuse lest worse Things come of it. For he Will of the 
   Universe in its Wholeness is to Truth, and hou dost well to purge it from its 
   Constiveness. For it is written that there is no bond that can unite the Divided 
   by Love, so that only those Complexes which are in Truth Simplicities, being 
   built Cell by Cell unto an Unity by Virtue of Love under Will, are worthy to 
   endure in their Progression.</p>

   DE OPERIBUS STELLAE MICROCOSMI. QUORUM SUNT QUATTOUR MINORES.</h2>
 <p>I have already written unto thee, my Son, of the Paradox of Liberty, how the 
   Freedom of thy Will dependeth upon the Bending of all thy forces to that one 
   End. But now also learn how great is the Oeconomy of our Magick, and this will 
   I declare unto thee in a Figure of the Holy Qabalah, to wit, the Formula of 
   the Tetragrammaton. Firstly, the Operation of Yod and He is not Vau only, but 
   with Vau appeareth also a new He, as a By-OProduct, and She is mysterious, being 
   at once the Flower of the three others, and their Poison. Now by the Operation 
   of Vau upon that He is no new Creation, but the Daughter is set upon the Throne 
   of Her Mother, and by this is rekindled the Fire of Yod, which, consuming that 
   Virgin, doth not add a Fifth Person, but balanceth and perfecteth all. For his 
   Shin, that is the Holy Spirit, pervadeth these, and is immanent. Thus in three 
   Operations is the Pentagram formulated. But in the Figure of that Star these 
   Operations are not indicated, for the five Lines of Force connect not according 
   to any of them; but five new Operations are made possible; and these are the 
   Works proper to the perfected man. First, the Work which lieth level, the Vau 
   with the He, is of he Yang and the Yin, and maketh One the Human with the Divine, 
   as in the Attainment of the Master of the Temple. Yet his Work hath his Perversion, 
   which is of Death. Thus then for thee four Works, they pertain all to the Natural 
   Formula of the Cross and Rose.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{gamma }<br>
   DE OPERIBUS STELLAE MICROCOSMI. QUORUM SUNT QUATTUOR MAJORES.</h2>
 <p>O my Son, behold now the Virtue and Mystery of the Silver Star! For of these 
   four Works not one leadeth to the Crown, because Tetragrammaton hath his Root 
   only in Chokmah. So herefore the Formula of the Rosy Cross availeth no more 
   in he Highest. Now then in the Pentagram are two Lines that invoke Spirit, though 
   they lead not thereunto, and they are he Works of He with He, and of Yod with 
   Vau. Of thee twain he former is a Work Magical of the Nature of Music, and it 
   draweth down the Fire of the HIGHER by Seduction or Bewitchment. And the latter 
   is a Work opposite thereunto, whose Effect forumlateth itself by direct Creation 
   in the Sphere of its Purpose and Intent. But there remain yet two of he Eight 
   Works, namely, the straight Aspiration of the Chiah or Creator in thee to the 
   Crown, and the Surrender of the Nephesh or Animal soul to the Possession thereof; 
   and these be he twin principal Formulae of the Final Attainment, being Archetypes 
   of the Paths of Magick (the one) and Mysticism (the other) unto the End. From 
   each of these Eight Works is derived a separate Mode of practical Use, each 
   after his Kind; and it should be well for thine Instruction if thou study upon 
   hese my Words, and found upon them a System. O my son, forget not therein the 
   Arcanum of their Balance and Proportion; for herein lieth the Mystery of their 
   Holiness.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{delta }<br>
   DE STELLA MACROCOSMI.</h2>
 <p>Thus far then concerning the Pentagram, how it is of the Cross, and its Virtue 
   of the Highest; but the Hexagram is for he most Part a Detail of the Formula 
   of the Rose and Cross. Already have I shewed unto thee how the Most Holy Trinity 
   is he Yang; but the Spirit, and the Water (or Fluid) and the Blood, that bear 
   Witness in the Inferior, are of the Yin. Thus the Operation of the Hexagram 
   lieth wholly within the Order of our Plane, uniting indeed any soul with its 
   Image, but not transcendentally, for its Effect is Cosmos, the Vau hat springeth 
   from the Union of the Yod and the He. Thus is it but a Glyph of that first Formula, 
   not of the others. But of all these Things shalt thou thyself make Study with 
   ardent Affection; for therein lie many Mysteries of practical Wisdom in our 
   Magick Art. And this is the Wonder and Beauty of this Work, that for every Man 
   is his own Palace. Yea, this is Life, that the Secrets of our Order are not 
   fixed and dead, as are the Formulae of the Outer. Know that in the many thousand 
   Times that I have performed the Ritual of the Pentagram or the Invocation of 
   the Heart girt with a Serpent, or the Mass of he Phoenix, or of the Holy Ghost, 
   there has not been one Time wherein I did not win new Light, or Knowledge or 
   Power or Virtue, save through mine own Weakness or Error.</p>

   DE SUA FEMINA OLUN, ET DE ECSTASIA PRAETER OMNIA.</h2>
 <p>My Son, I am enflamed with Love. I burn up eagerly in the Passion that thus 
   mightily consumeth me. Yet in myself I know not at all That which constraineth 
   me, and enkindleth my Soul in Ekstacy. There is Silence in my Soul, and the 
   Fear round about me, as I were Syrinx in the Night of the Forest. This is a 
   great Mystery that I endure, a Mystery too great for the mortal Part of me. 
   For but now, when I cried out upon the Name Olun, which is the secret Name of 
   my Lady that hath come o me --- most strangely! --- then I was rapt away altogether 
   subtly yet fiercely into a Trance that hath transformed me with Attainment, 
   yet without Trace in Mind. O my son! there is the Transfiguration of Glory, 
   and there is the Jewel in the Lotus-flower; yea, also is many other whereof 
   I am Partaker. But this last Passion, that my Lady Olun hath brought unto me 
   upon this last Day of the Winter of the thirteenth Year of the Aeon, even as 
   I wrote these Words unto thee, is a Mystery of Mysteries beyond all these. Oh 
   my son, thou knowest well the Perils and the Profit of our Path; continue thou 
   therein. Olun! {Mu }{alpha }{pi }{iota }{epsilon } BABALON! Adsum.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{digamma }<br>
   DE NOMINE OLUN.</h2>
 <p>Four Seasons, or it may be night five, ago, I thy Father was in the City called 
   New-Orleans, and being in Travail of Spirit I did invoke the God that giveth 
   Wisdom, bearing the Word of the All-Father by his Caduceus. Then, suddenly, 
   as I began (as it were a Gust of Fire whirled forth against that Idea) cam the 
   Wit of mine utter Identity, so that I ceased crying Mercurius Sum. Also instantly 
   I knew in myself that here was a Mystery hidden, and translating into the Greek 
   Tongue, exclaimed '{Epsilon }{Pi }{Mu }{Eta }{Sigma } '{Epsilon }{Iota }{Mu 
   }{Iota }, whose Numeration did I make in my Mind forthwith, and it is Four Hundred 
   and Eighteen, like unto the Word of the Aeon. So by this I knew that my Work 
   was well wrought in Truth. Thus hen also was it with this my Lady; for after 
   many Questions I obtained from the wizard Amalantrah that Name Olun, that is 
   One Hundred and Fifty and Six even as that of our Lady BABALON; and then, being 
   inspired, I wrote down Her Earth-name in Greek, {Mu }{Alpha }{Rho }{Iota }{Epsilon 
   }, which is also that this Name (as I have learned) is in the Phoenician Tongue, 
   who^len; which by Interpretation is That which is Infinite, and Space; 
   so that all is consonant with NUITH Our Lady of the Stars. Thus, o my Son, is 
   the Word of Truth echoed throughout all Worlds; and thus have the Wise mighty 
   Assurance in their Way. See, o my Son, that thou work not without this Guard 
   inflexible, lest thou err in thy Perceptions.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{zeta }<br>
   DE VIRIS MAGNANIMIS, AMORE PRAECLARISSIMIS.</h2>
 <p>Know that in the Mind of Man is much Wisdom that is hidden, being the Treasure 
   of his Sire that he inheriteth. Thus, night all of his moral Nature is unknown 
   to him until his Puberty; that is, this Nature pertaineth not unto the Recording 
   and Judging Apparatus of his Brain until it is put herein by the Stirring of 
   that deeper Nature within him. Thou wilt mark also that great Men are commonly 
   great Lovers; and this is in Part also because (consciously or not) they are 
   ware of that Secret following, that every Act of Love communicateth somewhat 
   of the Wisdom stored within him to his percipient Mind. Yet must such Act be 
   done rightly, according o Art; and unless such Act is of Profit alike to Mind 
   and Body, it is an Error. This then is true Doctrine; which if it be understanded 
   aright of thee, shall make diamond-clear thy Path in Love, which (to them that 
   know not this) is so obscure and perilous that I believe there is not one Man 
   in Ten Thousand that cometh not to Misadventure therein.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{eta }<br>
   DE CASTITATE.</h2>
 <p>My son, be fervent! Be firm! Be stable! Be quick to make Impurity, how one 
   Course of Ideas seeketh to infringe upon another, to quell the Virtue thereof. 
   Gold is pure, but to drink molten Gold were Impurity to thy Body, and its Destruction. 
   Law is a Code of the Customs of a People; if it intrude thereon to alter them, 
   it is an Impurity of Oppression. So also Diet is to be in Accord with Digestion; 
   Ethics were an Impurity therein. Love is an Expression of the Will of the Body, 
   yea, and more also, of That which created he Body; and its Operation is commonly 
   between One and One, so that the Interference of a Third Person is Impurity, 
   and not to be endured. Nay, even the thought of Third Person hath but ordinary 
   not Part in Love; so that, as thou seest constantly in thy Life, Love being 
   strong, taketh no heed of others, and some after Interference bringeth Misfortune. 
   Now hen shell we therefore cast out Love, or accept Impurity herein? God forbid. 
   And for this Cause see thou well to it hat in thy Kingdom there be no Interference 
   there with, nor Hindrance from any. For it is perfect in itself.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{theta }<br>
   DE CEREMONIO EQUINOXI.</h2>
 <p>My Son, our Father in Heaven hath passed into the Sign of he Ram. I have performed 
   the Rite of Union with Him according to the ancient Manner, and I know the Word 
   that shall rule the Semester. Also it is given unto my Spirit to write unto 
   thee concerning the Virtue of this Rite, and many another of Antiquity. And 
   it is this, that our Forefathers made of these Ceremonies an Epitome Mnemonic, 
   wherein certain Truths, or true Relations, should be communicated in a magical 
   Manner. Now therefore by the Practice of these mayst thou awaken thy Wisdom, 
   that it may manifest in thy conscious Mind. And this Way is of Use even when 
   the Ceremonies, as those of he Christians, are corrupt and deformed; but in 
   such a Case hou shalt seek out the true ancient Significance thereof. For there 
   is that within thee which remembereth Truth, and is ready to communicate the 
   same unto thee when thou hast Wit to evoke it from the Aditum and Sanctuary 
   of thy Being. And this is to be done by this Repetition of the Formula of that 
   Truth. Note thou further that this which I tell thee is the Defence of Formalism; 
   and indeed thou must work upon a certain Skeleton, but clothe it with live Flesh.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{iota }<br>
   DE LUCE STELLARUM.</h2>
 <p>It was that most Holy Prophet, thine Uncle, called upon Earth William O'Neill, 
   or Blake, who wrote for our Understanding these Eleven Sacred Words! --- </p>
 <blockquote> 
   <p>If the Sun and Moon should doubt<br>
     They'd immediately go out.</p>
 </blockquote>
 <p>O my Son, our Work is to shine by Fore and Virtue of our own Natures without 
   Consciousness or consideration. Now, notwithstanding that our Radiance is constant 
   and undimmed, it may be that Clouds gathering about us conceal our Glory from 
   he Vision of other Stars. These Clouds are our Thoughts; not hose true Thoughts 
   which are but conscious Expressions of our Will, such as manifest in our Poesy, 
   or our Music, or other Flower-Ray of our Life quintessential. Nay, the Cloud-Thought 
   is born of Division and of Doubt; for all Thoughts, except hey be creative emanations, 
   are Witnesses to Conflict within us. Our settled Relations with the Universe 
   do not disturb our Minds, as, by Example, our automatic Functions, which speak 
   to us only in the Sign of Distress. Thus all consideration is Demonstration 
   of Doubt, and Doubt of Duality, which is the Root of Choronzon.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{kappa }<br>
   DE CANTU.</h2>
 <p>So then, o my Son, there is my Wisdom, that the Voice of he Soul in its true 
   Nature Eternal and Unchangeable, comprehending all Change, is Silence; and the 
   Voice of the Soul, dynamic, in the Way of its Will, is song. Nor is there any 
   Form of utterance that is not, as song is, the Music proper to that Motion, 
   according to the Law. Thus, as thy Cousin Arthur Machen hath rejoiced to make 
   plain unto Men in his Book called "Hieroglyphics", the first Quality 
   of Art is its Ekstacy. So, night to all Men at one Time or other, cometh Joy 
   of Creation, with the Belief that their Utterance is holy and beautiful, glorious 
   with Banners. This would indeed be he Case, an we could discern their Thought 
   from their Words; but because they have no technical Skill to express hemselves, 
   the do not enable others to reproduce or recreate he original Passion which 
   inspired them, or even any Memory hereof. Understand then what is the Agony 
   of the Great Soul who hath every Key of Paradise at his Girdle, when he would 
   open the Gate of Holiness, or of Beauty, or any Virtue soever, o the Men of 
   his Age!</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{lambda }<br>
   DE STULTITIA HUMANA.</h2>
 <p>Know that a Mind can only apprehend those Things with which it is already familiar, 
   at least in Part. Moreover, it will ever interpret according to the Distortion 
   of its own Lenses. Thus, in a great War, all Speech soever may be understood 
   as if it were of Reference thereunto; also, a Guilty Person, or a Melancholic 
   may see in every Stranger an Officer of Justice, or one of them that are banded 
   together to persecute him, as he Case may be. But consider moreover that the 
   Mysterious is always the Terrible, for Vulgar Minds. How then when a New Word 
   is spoken? Either it is not heard, or it is misunderstood; and it evoketh Fear 
   and Hate as a Reaction against Fear. Then Men take him and set him at naught, 
   and spit upon him and scourge him, and lead him away to crucify him; and the 
   third Day he riseth from among the Dead, and ascendeth into Heaven, and sitteth 
   at the right Hand of God, and cometh to judge the Quick and the Dead. This, 
   o my son, is the History of Every Man unto whom is given a Word.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{mu }<br>
   DE SUO PROELIO.</h2>
 <p>Now therefore thou seest how Men take the Son of Science, and burn him for 
   a Sorcerer or a Heretic; the Poet and cast him out as Reprobate; the Painter, 
   as deforming Nature, the Musician, as denying Harmony; and so for every New 
   Word. How much more, then, if the Word be of Universal Import, a Word of Revolution 
   and of Revelation in the Deep of the Soul? A new Star; that is for the Astronomers, 
   and maybe setteth them by he Ears. But a new Sun! That were for all Men; and 
   a Seed of Tumult and Upheavel in every Land. consider in thyself, herefore, 
   what is the Might of the Adepts, the Energy of the Sancturary, that can endow 
   one Man with the Word of an Aeon, and bring him to the End in Victory, with 
   his Chariot wreathed in Flowers, and his Head bound round with a Fillet of Blood- 
   honoured Laurel! My Son, thou are entered into the Battle; and the Men of our 
   Race and our Clan return not save in Glory.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{nu }<br>
   DE NECESSITATE VERBI CLAMANDI.</h2>
 <p>He that striveth against his own Nature is a Fool, and wotteth not his Will, 
   darkening Counsel in himself, and denying his own God, and giving Place to Choronzon. 
   So then his Work becometh Hotchpot, and he is shattered and dispersed in the 
   Abyss. Nor is it better for him if he do this for the supposed Good of another, 
   and for that other is it Evil also in the End of the Matter. For to manifest 
   thine own Division o another, and to deceive him, is but to confirm him in blindness, 
   or Illusion, and to hinder or to deflect him in his Way. Now to do thine own 
   Will is to leave him free to do his own Will, but to mask thy Will is to falsify 
   one of the Beacons by which he may steer his Ship. My son, all division of Soul, 
   that begetteth Neurosis and Insanity, cometh from wrong Adjustment to Reality, 
   and to Fear thereof. Wilt thou hen hide Truth from thy Brother, lest he suffer? 
   Thou dost not well, but confirmest him in Iniquity, and in Illusion, and in 
   Infirmity of Spirit.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{xi }<br>
   DE MYSTERIO EUCHARISTICO UNIVERSALI.</h2>
 <p>My son, heed also this Word of thine Uncle William O'Neill; Everything that 
   lives is holy. Yea, and more also, every Act is holy, being essential to the 
   Universal Sacrament. Knowing his, thou mayst conform with that which is written 
   in "The Book of the Law": to make no Distinction between any one Thing 
   and any other Thing. Learn well to apprehend this Mystery, for it is the Great 
   Gate of the College of Understanding, whereby each and all of thy Senses become 
   constant and perpetual Witnesses of the One Eucharist, whereunto also they are 
   Ministers. So then to thee every Phenomenon soever is the Body of Nuith in her 
   Passion; for it is an Event; that is, the Marriage of some one Point of view 
   with some One Possibility. And this State of Mind is notably an Appurtenance 
   of thy Grade of Master of the Temple, and the Unveiling of the Arcanum of Sorrow, 
   which is thy Work, as it is written in Liber Magi. Moreover, this State, assimilated 
   in the very Marrow of thy Mind, is the first Stop toward the comprehension of 
   the Arcanum of Change, which is the Root of the Work of a Magus of Our Holy 
   Order. O my Son, bind this within thine Heart, for its Name is the Beatific 
   Vision.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{omicron }<br>
   DE RECTO IN RECTO.</h2>
 <p>Now also then I bid thee use all filial Diligence, and attend to this same 
   Word in the Mouth of thine earliest Ancestor (except we adventure to invoke 
   the Name <strong>FU---HSI</strong>) in our known Genealogy, the Most Holy, the 
   True Man, Lao-Tze, that gave His Light unto the Kingdom of Flowers. For being 
   questioned concerning the abode of the Tao, he gave Answer that It was in the 
   Dung. Again, the Tathagata, the Buddha, most blessed, most perfect and most 
   enlightened, added His Voice, that there is no Grain of Dust which shall not 
   attain to the Arhan. Keep therefore in just Balance the Relation of Illusion 
   to Illusion in that Aspect of Illusion, neither confusing the Planes, nor confounding 
   the Stars, nor denying the Laws of their Reaction, yet with Eagle's Vision beholding 
   the One Sun of the True Nature of the Whole. Verily, his is the Truth, and unto 
   it did also Dionysus and Tahuti and Sri Krishna set the seal of their Witness. 
   Cleanse herefore thine Heart, o my son, in the Waters of the Great Sea, and 
   enkindle it with the Fire of the Holy Ghost. For his is His peculiar Work of 
   Sanctification.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{pi }<br>
   DE VIRGINE BEATA.</h2>
 <p>Understand then well this Mystery of Universal Godliness; for it is the naked 
   Beauty of the Virgin of the World. Lo! Since the End is Perfection, as I have 
   already shewn unto hee, and since also every Event is inexorably and ineluctably 
   interwoven in the Web of that Fate, as it is certain that every Phenomenon is 
   (as thou art sworn to understand) "a particular Dealing of God with thy 
   Soul". Yea, and more also, it is a necessary Rubric in this Ritual of Perfection. 
   Turn not therefore away thine Eyes, for that they are too pure to behold Evil; 
   but look upon Evil with Joy, comprehending it in he Fervour of this Light that 
   I have enkindled in thy Mind. Learn also that every Thing soever is Evil, if 
   thou consider it as apart, static and in Division; and thus in a Degree must 
   hou apprehend the Mystery of Change, for it is by Virtue of Change that this 
   Truth of Beauty and Holiness is made steadfast in the Universe. O my son, there 
   is no Delight sweeter than the continuous Contemplation of this Marvel and Pageant 
   that is ever about thee; it is the Beatitude of the Beatitudes.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{koppa }<br>
   DE LOCO SUAE MOECHAE.</h2>
 <p>Resist not Change, therefore, but act constantly according o thy True Nature, 
   for here only thou standest in Sorrow, if here be a Division conscious of itself, 
   and hindered from its Way (whose Name is Love) unto its Dissolution. It is written 
   in "The Book of the Law" that the Pain of Division is as nothing, 
   and the Joy of Dissolution all. Now then here is an Art and Device of Magick 
   that I will declare unto thee, albeit it is a Peril if thou be not fixed in 
   that Truth and in that Beatific Vision whereof I have written in the three Chapters 
   foregoing. And it is this, to create by Artifice a Conflict in thyself, that 
   thou mayst take thy Pleasure in its Resolution. Of this Play is thy sweet Stepmother, 
   my concubine, the Holy and Adulterous Olun, sublimely Mistress; for she invoketh 
   in her Fancy a thousand Obstacles to Love, so hat she shuddereth at a Touch, 
   swooneth at a Kiss, and suffereth Death and Hell in the Ekstacy of her Body. 
   And this is her Art, and it is of Nuit Our Lady, for it is the Drama of Commemoration 
   of the whole mystery of By-coming. </p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{rho }<br>
   DE PERICULO JOCORUM AMORIS.</h2>
 <p>Yet be thou heedful, o my son, for this Art is set upon a Razor's Edge. In 
   our Blood is this great Pox of Sin, whose Word is Restriction, as Inheritance 
   of our Sires that served he Slave-Gods. Thou must be free in the Law of Thelema, 
   perfectly one with thy true Self, singly and wholly bound in hy true Will, before 
   thou durst (in Prudence) invoke the Name of Choronzon, even for thy good Sport 
   and Phantasy. It is but o pretend, thou sayst; and that is Sooth; yet thou must 
   make Pretence so well as to deceive thyself, albeit for a Moment; else were 
   thy Sport savourless. Then, and thou have one point of Weakness in thee, that 
   Thought of thine may incarnate, and destroy thee. Verily, the wise Enchanter 
   is sure beyond Doubt of his Charm ere he toy with a Fanged Cobra; and thou will 
   knowest that this Peril of Division in thy Self is the only one that can touch 
   thee. For all other Evil is but Elaboration of this Theme of Choronzon. Praise 
   therefore thy sweet Stepmother my concubine, the Holy and Adulterous Olun; and 
   thine own Mother Hilarion, for in this Art was she also pre-eminent.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{sigma }<br>
   DE LIBIDINE SECRETA.</h2>
 <p>It is said among Men that the Word Hell deriveth from the Word helan, to hele 
   or conceal, in the Tongue of the Anglo- Saxons. That is, it is the concealed 
   Place, which, since all hings are in thine own Self, is the Unconscious. How 
   then? Because Men were already aware how this Unconscious, or Libido, is opposed, 
   for the most Part , to the conscious Will. In the Salve-Ages this is a Truth 
   Universal, or well night to it; for in such Times are Men compelled to Uniformity 
   by the Constraint of Necessity herself. Yea, of old it was a continual Siege 
   of every Man of every Clan, of every Environment; and to relax guard was then 
   Self-murdr, or also Treachery. so then no Man might chose his way, until he 
   were Hunter, Fighter, Builder; not any Woman, but she must first be Breeder. 
   Now in the Growth of States by Organisation came, stepping stealthily, a certain 
   Security against the grossest Perils, so that a few Men could be spared from 
   Toil to cultivate Wisdom, and this was first provided by the Selection of a 
   caste Pontifical. By this Device came the Alliance of King and Priest, Strength 
   and Cunning fortifying each the other through the Division of Labour.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{tau }<br>
   DE ORDINE CIVITATUM.</h2>
 <p>So presently, O my son, this first Organisation among Men, by a Procedure parallel 
   to that of the Differentiation of Protoplasm, made the State competent to explore 
   and to control Nature; and every Profit of this sort released more energy, and 
   enlarged the class of the Learned, until, as it is this day, only a small proportion 
   of any man's work must needs go o the satisfaction of first will essential and 
   common, the provision of shelter, food, and protection. Verily, also thou seest 
   many women made free to live as they will, even o the admiration and delight 
   of the Sage whose eye laugheth to contemplate mischief. Thus the duty of every 
   Unit towards the whole is diminished, and also the necessity to conform with 
   hose narrow laws which preserve primitive tribes in their struggle against environment. 
   Thus the State need suppress only such heresies as directly threaten its political 
   stability, only such modes of life as work manifest and proven hurt to others, 
   or cause general disorder by their scandal. Therefore save and except he interferes 
   thereby with the root laws of common weal, a man is free to develop as he will 
   according to his true nature.</p>
 <h2 align="center">{Delta }{upsilon }<br>
   DE SCIENTIAE MODO.</h2>
 <p>To the mind of the early Philosopher, therefore, any variation in type must 
   appear as a disaster; yea, intelligence itself must perforce prove its value 
   to the brute, or he distrusteth it and destroyeth it. Yet as thou knowest, that 
   variation which is fitted to the environment is the salvation of the species. 
   Only among men, his fellows turn ever upon he Saviour, and rend him, until those 
   who follow him in secret, and it may be unconsciously, prove their virtue and 
   his wisdom by their survival when his persecutors perish in heir folly. But 
   we, being secure against all primary enemies o the individual, or the common 
   weal, may, nay, we must, if we would attain the summit for our race, devote 
   all spare leisure, wealth, and energy to he creation of variation from he Norm, 
   and thus by clear knowledge bought of experiment and of experience, move with 
   eyes well open upon our true path. So therefore Our Law of Thelema is justified 
   also of biology and of social science. It is the true Way of Nature, the right 
   strategy in the way of man with his environment, and the life of his soul.</p>

   DE MONSTRIS.</h2>
 <p>Sayst thou, o my son, that not thus, but by forced raining, one cometh to perfection. 
   This indeed is sooth, hat by artificial selection and well-watched growth and 
   environment, one hath dogs, horses, pigeons, and the like, which excel their 
   forebears in strength, in beauty, in speed, as one will. Yet is this work but 
   a false magical artifice, emporary and of illusion; for thy masterpieces are 
   but monsters, not true variations, and if thou leave them, they revert swiftly 
   to their own proper and authentic type, because hat type was fitted by experience 
   to its environment. So every variation must be left free to perpetuate itself 
   of perish, not cherished for its beauty, or guarded for its appeal to thine 
   ideal, or cut off in thy fear thereof. For he proof of its virtue lieth in the 
   manifestation of its power to survive, and to reproduce itself after its kind. 
   Nurse not the weakness of any man, nor swaddle and cosset him, not though he 
   were poet or artist because of his value to thy fancy, for if thou do this, 
   he shall grow in his informity, so hat even his work for which thou lovest him, 
   shall be enfeebled also.</p>

   DE INFERNO PALATIO SAPIENTIAE.</h2>
 <p>Now then thou seest that this Hell, or concealed place within thee, is no more 
   a fear or hindrance to men of a free race, but the treasure house of the assimilated 
   wisdom of the ages, and the knowledge of the True Way. Thus are we just and 
   wise to discover this secret in ourselves, to conform the conscious mind therewith. 
   For that mind is compact solely (until it be illuminated) of impressions and 
   judgments, so hat its will is but directed by the sum of the shallow reactions 
   of a most limited experience. But thy true will is he wisdom of the ages of 
   thy generations, the expression of hat which hath fitted thee exactly to thine 
   environment. Thus thy conscious mind is oftentimes foolish, as when thou admirest 
   an ideal, and wouldst attain it, but thy true will letteth thee, so that there 
   is conflict, and the humiliation of that mind. Here will I call to witness the 
   common event of "Good Resolutions" that defy the lightning of destiny, 
   being puffed up by the mind of an indigestible ideal putrefying within thee. 
   Thence cometh colic, and presently the poison is expelled, or else thou diest. 
   But resolutions of true will are mighty against circumstance.</p>

   DE VITIIS VOLUNTATIS SECRETAE.</h2>
 <p>Learn moreover concerning this Hell, or hidden wisdom, that is within thee, 
   that it is modified, little by little, through he experience of the conscious 
   mind, which feedeth it. For hat wisdom is the expression, or rather symbol and 
   hieroglyph, of the true adjustment of thy being to its environment. Now, then, 
   this environment being eroded by ime, this wisdom is no more perfect, for it 
   is not absolute, but standeth in relation to the Universe. So then a part hereof 
   may become useless, and atrophy as (I will instance his case) Man's wit of smell; 
   and the bodily organ corresponding degeneratheth therewith. But this is an effect 
   of much time, so that in thy hell thou art like to find elements vain, or foolish, 
   or contrary to thy present weal. Yet, o my Son, this hidden wisdom is not thy 
   true will, but only the levers (I may say so) thereof. Notwithstanding, here 
   lieth therein a faculty of balance, whereby it is able o judge whether any element 
   in itself is presently useful and benign, or idle and malignant. Here then is 
   a root of conflict between the conscious and the unconscious, and a debate concerning 
   the right order of conduct, how the will may be accomplished.</p>

   DE RATIONE PRAESIDIO VOLUNTATIS.</h2>
 <p>O my Son, in this case is there darkness, yet this comfort as a lamp therein, 
   that there is no error in the will, but only doubt as to the means of success, 
   else were we as children afeared of Night. Thus we have need of naught but to 
   consider the matter by wit of reason, and of prudence, and on common sense, 
   and of experience, and of science, adjusting ourselves so far as we may. Here 
   is the key of success, and its name is the skill to make right use of circumstance. 
   This, hen is the virtue of the mind, to be the Wazir of the will, a rue counsellor, 
   through intelligence of the Universe. But o, my Son, do thou lay this word beneath 
   thine heart, that the mind hath no will, nor right thereto, so the Usurpation 
   bringeth forth a fatal conflict in thyself. For the mind is sensitive, unstable 
   as air, and may be led foolishly in leash by a stronger mind that worketh as 
   the cunning tool of a will. Therefore thy safety and defence is to hold thy 
   mind to his right function, a faithful minister to thine own true will, but 
   election of nature. Heed well this, o my Son, for thy mind passive is rightly 
   a mirror to reflect all things clearly without prejudice, and to remain unstained 
   by them.</p>
