 <p>LITTLE Jesus, wast Thou shy<br> Once, and just so small as I?<br> And what did it feel like to be<br> Out of Heaven, and just like me?<br> Didst Thou sometimes think of there.<br> And ask where all the angels were?<br> I should think that I would cry<br> For my house all made of sky;<br> I would look about the air,<br> And wonder where my angels were;<br> And at waking 'twould distress me--<br> Not an angel there to dress me!</p>  
 <p>Hadst Thou ever any toys,<br> Like us little girls and boys?<br> And didst Thou play in Heaven with all<br> The angels, that were not too tall,<br> With stars for marbles? Did the things<br> Play Can you see me? through their wings?<br> And did Thy Mother let Thee spoil<br> Thy robes, with playing on our soil?<br> How nice to have them always new<br> In Heaven, because 'twas quite clean blue.</p>  
 <p>Didst Thou kneel at night to pray,<br> And didst Thou join Thy hands, this way?<br> And did they tire sometimes, being young,<br> And make the prayer seem very long?<br> And dost Thou like it best, that we<br> Should join our hands to pray to Thee?<br> I used to think, before I knew,<br> The prayer not said unless we do.<br> And did Thy Mother at the night<br> Kiss Thee, and fold the clothes in right?<br> And didst Thou feel quite good in bed,<br> Kiss'd, and sweet, and Thy prayers said?</p>  
 <p>Thou canst not have forgotten all<br> That it feels like to be small:<br> And Thou know'st I cannot pray<br> To Thee in my father's way--<br> When Thou wast so little, say,<br> Couldst Thou talk Thy Father's way?<br> So, a little Child, come down<br> And hear a child's tongue like Thy own;<br> Take me by the hand and walk,<br> And listen to my baby-talk.<br> To Thy Father show my prayer<br> (He will look, Thou art so fair),<br> And say: "O Father, I, thy Son,<br> Bring the prayer of a little one."</p>  
 <p>And He will smile, that children's tongue<br> Has not changed since Thou wast young!</p>  
 <p>--FRANCIS THOMPSON</p>
