 <p>We have already seen a good deal of masking in connection with St. Nicholas, 
 Knecht Ruprecht, and other figures of the German Christmas; we may next give 
 some attention to English customs of the same sort during the Twelve Days, and 
 then pass on to the strange burlesque ceremonies of the Feast of Fools and the 
 Boy Bishop, ceremonies which show an intrusion of pagan mummery into the 
 sanctuary itself.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Christmas Masking.</span></h3>
 <p>The custom of Christmas masking, “mumming,” or “disguising” can be traced at 
 the English court as early as the reign of Edward III. It is in all probability 
 connected with that wearing of beasts heads and skins of which we have already 
 noted various examples﻿—its origin in folk-custom seems to have been the coming 
 of a band of worshippers clad in this uncouth but auspicious garb to bring good 
 luck to a house.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-1">14-1</a><a name="Nanchor_14-1"></a> The most direct English survival is found in the 
 village mummers who still call themselves “guisers” or “geese-dancers” and claim 
 the right to enter every house. These will be dealt with shortly, after a 
 consideration of more courtly customs of the same kind.</p>
 <p><a name="page_298"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 298</font></a> <a name="Page_298"></a>In the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries the 
 English court masque reached its greatest developments; the fundamental idea was 
 then generally overlaid with splendid trappings, the dresses and the 
 arrangements were often extremely elaborate, and the introduction of dialogued 
 speech made these “disguises” regular dramatic performances. A notable example 
 is Ben Jonson's “Masque of Christmas.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-2">14-2</a><a name="Nanchor_14-2"></a> Shakespeare, however, gives us in “Henry VIII.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-3">14-3</a><a name="Nanchor_14-3"></a> an example of a simpler impromptu form: the king and a 
 party dressed up as shepherds break in upon a banquet of Wolsey's.</p>
 <p>In this volume we are more concerned with the popular Christmas than with the 
 festivities of kings and courts and grandees. Mention must, however, be made of 
 a personage who played an important part in the Christmas of the Tudor court and 
 appeared also in colleges, Inns of Court, and the houses of the nobility﻿—the 
 “Lord of Misrule.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-4">14-4</a><a name="Nanchor_14-4"></a> He was annually elected to preside over the revels, 
 had a retinue of courtiers, and was surrounded by elaborate ceremonial. He seems 
 to be the equivalent and was probably the direct descendant of the “Abbot” or 
 “Bishop” of the Feast of Fools, who will be noticed later in this chapter. 
 Sometimes indeed he is actually called “Abbot of Misrule.” A parallel to him is 
 the Twelfth Night “king,” and he appears to be a courtly example of the 
 temporary monarch of folk-custom, though his name is sometimes extended to 
 “kings” of quite vulgar origin elected not by court or gentry but by the common 
 people. The “Lord of Misrule” was among the relics of paganism most violently 
 attacked by Puritan writers like Stubbes and Prynne, and the Great Rebellion 
 seems to have been the death of him.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">Mummers Plays and Morris Dances.</span></h3>
 <p>Let us turn now to the rustic Christmas mummers, to-day fast disappearing, 
 but common enough in the mid-nineteenth century. Their goings-on are really far 
 more interesting, because more traditional, than the elaborate shows and 
 dressings-up of the court. Their names vary: “mummers” and “guisers” are the 
 commonest; in Sussex they are “tipteerers,” perhaps because of <a name="page_299"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 299</font></a> <a name="Page_299"></a>the perquisites they collect, in Cornwall “geese-dancers” 
 (“geese” no doubt comes from “disguise”), in Shropshire “morris”﻿—or 
 “merry”﻿—“dancers.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-5">14-5</a><a name="Nanchor_14-5"></a> It is to be noted that they are unbidden guests, and 
 enter your house as of right.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-6">14-6</a><a name="Nanchor_14-6"></a> Sometimes they merely dance, sing, and feast, but 
 commonly they perform a rude drama.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-7">14-7</a><a name="Nanchor_14-7"></a> </p>
 <p>The plays acted by the mummers﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-8">14-8</a><a name="Nanchor_14-8"></a> vary so much that it is difficult to describe them in 
 general terms. There is no reason to suppose that the words are of great 
 antiquity﻿—the earliest form may perhaps date from the seventeenth century; they 
 appear to be the result of a crude dramatic and literary instinct working upon 
 the remains of traditional ritual, and manipulating it for purposes of 
 entertainment. The central figure is St. George (occasionally he is called Sir, 
 King, or Prince George), and the main dramatic substance, after a prologue and 
 introduction of the characters, is a fight and the arrival of a doctor to bring 
 back the slain to life. At the close comes a <i>quête</i> for money. The name 
 George is found in all the Christmas plays, but the other characters have a 
 bewildering variety of names ranging from Hector and Alexander to Bonaparte and 
 Nelson.</p>
 <p>Mr. Chambers in two very interesting and elaborately documented chapters has 
 traced a connection between these St. George players and the sword-dancers found 
 at Christmas or other festivals in Germany, Spain, France, Italy, Sweden, and 
 Great Britain. The sword-dance in its simplest form is described by Tacitus in 
 his “Germania”: “they have,” he says of the Germans, “but one kind of public 
 show: in every gathering it is the same. Naked youths, who profess this sport, 
 fling themselves in dance among swords and levelled lances.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-9">14-9</a><a name="Nanchor_14-9"></a> In certain forms of the dance there are figures in 
 which the swords are brought together on the heads of performers, or a pretence 
 is made to cut at heads and feet, or the swords are put in a ring round a 
 person's neck. This strongly suggests that an execution, probably a sacrifice, 
 lies at the bottom of the dances. In several cases, moreover, they are 
 accompanied by sets of verses containing the incident of a quarrel and the 
 violent death of one of the performers. The likeness to the central feature of 
 the <a name="page_300"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 300</font></a> <a name="Page_300"></a>St. George play﻿—the slaying﻿—will be noticed. In one of 
 the dances, too, there is even a doctor who revives the victim.</p>
 <p>In England the sword-dance is found chiefly in the north, but with it appear 
 to be identical the morris-dances﻿—characterized by the wearing of jingling 
 bells﻿—which are commoner in the southern counties. Blackened faces are common 
 in both, and both have the same grotesque figures, a man and a woman, often 
 called Tommy and Bessy in the sword-dance and “the fool” and Maid Marian in the 
 morris. Moreover the morris-dancers in England sometimes use swords, and in one 
 case the performers of an undoubted sword-dance were called “morrice” dancers in 
 the eighteenth century. Bells too, so characteristic of the morris, are 
 mentioned in some Continental accounts of the sword-dance.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_111">111</a><a name="FNanchor_111"></a></p>
 <p>Intermediate between these dances and the fully developed St. George dramas 
 are the plays performed on Plough Monday in Lincolnshire and the East Midlands. 
 They all contain a good deal of dancing, a violent death and a revival, and 
 grotesques found both in the dances and in the Christmas plays.</p>
 <p>The sword-dance thus passes by a gradual transition, the dancing diminishing, 
 the dramatic elements increasing, into the mummers plays of St. George. The 
 central motive, death and revival, Mr. Chambers regards as a symbol of the 
 resurrection of the year or the spirit of vegetation,﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_112">112</a><a name="FNanchor_112"></a> like the Thuringian custom of executing a “wild man” 
 covered with leaves, whom a doctor brings to life again by bleeding. This piece 
 of ritual has apparently been attracted to Christmas from an early feast of 
 spring, and Plough Monday, when the East Midland plays take place, is just such 
 an early spring feast. Again, in some places the <a name="page_301"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 301</font></a> <a name="Page_301"></a>St. George play is performed at Easter, a date alluded to 
 in the title, “Pace-eggers” or “Pasque-eggers” play.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-13">14-13</a><a name="Nanchor_14-13"></a> </p>
 <p>Two grotesque figures appear with varying degrees of clearness and with 
 various names in the dances and in the plays﻿—the “fool” (Tommy) who wears the 
 skin and tail of a fox or other animal, and a man dressed in woman's clothes 
 (Bessy). In these we may recognize the skin-clad mummer and the man aping a 
 woman whom we meet in the old Kalends denunciations. Sometimes the two are 
 combined, while a hobby-horse also not unfrequently appears.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-14">14-14</a><a name="Nanchor_14-14"></a> </p>
 <p>How exactly St. George came to be the central figure of the Christmas plays 
 is uncertain; possibly they may be a development of a dance in which appeared 
 the “Seven Champions,” the English national heroes﻿—of whom Richard Johnson 
 wrote a history in 1596﻿—with St. George at their head. It is more probable, 
 however, that the saint came in from the mediaeval pageants held on his day in 
 many English towns.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-15">14-15</a><a name="Nanchor_14-15"></a> </p>
 <p class="thoughtbreak">Can it be that the German St. Nicholas plays are more 
 Christianized and sophisticated forms of folk-dramas like in origin to those we 
 have been discussing? They certainly resemble the English plays in the manner in 
 which one actor calls in another by name; while the grotesque figures introduced 
 have some likeness to the “fool” of the morris.</p>
 <p>Christmas mumming, it may be added, is found in eastern as well as western 
 Europe. In Greece, where ecclesiastical condemnations of such things can be 
 traced with remarkable clearness from early times to the twelfth century, it 
 takes sundry forms. “At Pharsala,” writes Mr. J. C. Lawson, “there is a sort of 
 play at the Epiphany, in which the mummers represent bride, bridegroom, and 
 Arab; the Arab tries to carry off the bride, and the bridegroom defends 
 her.... Formerly also at Kozane and in many other parts of Greece, according 
 to a Greek writer in the early part of the nineteenth century, throughout the 
 Twelve Days boys carrying bells used to go round the houses, singing songs and 
 having one or more of their company dressed up with masks and bells and foxes 
 brushes and other such things to give them a weird and monstrous look.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-16">14-16</a><a name="Nanchor_14-16"></a> </p>
 <p><a name="page_302"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 302</font></a> <a name="Page_302"></a>In Russia, too, mummers used to go about at Christmastide, 
 visiting houses, dancing, and performing all kinds of antics. “Prominent parts 
 were always played by human representatives of a goat and a bear. Some of the 
 party would be disguised as Lazaruses, that is, as blind beggars.” A certain 
 number of the mummers were generally supposed to play the part of thieves 
 anxious to break in.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-17">14-17</a><a name="Nanchor_14-17"></a> Readers of Tolstoy's “War and Peace” may remember a 
 description of some such maskings in the year 1810.</p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">The Feast of Fools.</span></h3>
 <p>So far, in this Second Part, we have been considering customs practised 
 chiefly in houses, streets, and fields. We must now turn to certain festivities 
 following hard upon Christmas Day, which, though pagan in origin and sometimes 
 even blasphemous, found their way in the Middle Ages within the walls of the 
 church.</p>
 <p>Shortly after Christmas a group of <i>tripudia</i> or revels was held by the 
 various inferior clergy and ministrants of cathedrals and other churches. These 
 festivals, of which the best known are the Feast of Fools and the Boy Bishop 
 ceremonies, have been so fully described by other writers, and my space here is 
 so limited, that I need but treat them in outline, and for detail refer the 
 reader to such admirable accounts as are to be found in Chapters XIII., XIV., 
 and XV. of Mr. Chamber's “The Mediaeval Stage.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-18">14-18</a><a name="Nanchor_14-18"></a> </p>
 <p>Johannes Belethus, Rector of Theology at Paris towards the end of the twelfth 
 century, speaks of four <i>tripudia</i> held after Christmas:﻿—those of the 
 deacons on St. Stephen's Day, the priests on St. John's, the choir-boys on Holy 
 Innocents, and the subdeacons on the Circumcision, the Epiphany, or the Octave 
 of the Epiphany. The feast of subdeacons, says Belethus, “we call that of 
 fools.” It is this feast which, though not apparently the earliest in origin of 
 the four, was the most riotous and disorderly, and shows most clearly its pagan 
 character. Belethus mention of it is the first clear notice, though disorderly 
 revels of the same kind seem to have existed at Constantinople as early as the 
 ninth century. At first confined to the subdeacons, the Feast of Fools became in 
 its later developments a festival not only of that order but of the <a name="page_303"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 303</font></a> <a name="Page_303"></a>inferior clergy in general, of the vicars choral, the 
 chaplains, and the choir-clerks, as distinguished from the canons. For this 
 rabble of poor and low-class clergy it was no doubt a welcome relaxation, and 
 one can hardly wonder that they let themselves go in burlesquing the sacred but 
 often wearisome rites at which it was their business to be present through many 
 long hours, or that they delighted to usurp for once in a way the functions 
 ordinarily performed by their superiors. The putting down of the mighty from 
 their seat and the exalting of them of low degree was the keynote of the 
 festival. While “Deposuit potentes de sede: et exaltavit humiles” was being sung 
 at the “Magnificat,” it would appear that the precentor's <i>baculus</i> or 
 staff was handed over to the clerk who was to be “lord of the feast” for the 
 year, and throughout the services of the day the inferior clergy predominated, 
 under the leadership of this chosen “lord.” He was usually given some title of 
 ecclesiastical dignity, “bishop,” “prelate,” “archbishop,” “cardinal,” or even 
 “pope,” was vested in full pontificals, and in some cases sat on the real 
 bishop's throne, gave benedictions, and issued indulgences.</p>
 <p>These lower clergy, it must be remembered, belonged to the peasant or small 
 <i>bourgeois</i> class and were probably for the most part but ill-educated. 
 They were likely to bring with them into the Church the superstitions floating 
 about among the people, and the Feast of Fools may be regarded as a recoil of 
 paganism upon Christianity in its very sanctuary. “An ebullition of the natural 
 lout beneath the cassock” it has been called by Mr. Chambers, and many of its 
 usages may be explained by the reaction of coarse natures freed for once from 
 restraint. It brought to light, however, not merely personal vulgarity, but a 
 whole range of traditional customs, derived probably from a fusion of the Roman 
 feast of the Kalends of January with Teutonic or Celtic heathen festivities.</p>
 <p>A general account of its usages is given in a letter addressed in 1445 by the 
 Paris Faculty of Theology to the bishops and chapters of France:﻿—</p>
 <blockquote>
   <p>“Priests and clerks may be seen wearing masks and monstrous visages at the 
   hours of office. They dance in the choir dressed as <a name="page_304"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 304</font></a> <a name="Page_304"></a>women, panders or minstrels. They sing wanton songs. They 
   eat black puddings at the horn of the altar while the celebrant is saying 
   Mass. They play at dice there. They cense with stinking smoke from the soles 
   of old shoes. They run and leap through the church, without a blush at their 
   own shame. Finally they drive about the town and its theatres in shabby traps 
   and carts, and rouse the laughter of their fellows and the bystanders in 
   infamous performances, with indecent gesture and verses scurrilous and 
   unchaste.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-19">14-19</a><a name="Nanchor_14-19"></a> </p></blockquote>
 <p>The letter also speaks of “bishops” or “archbishops” of Fools, who wore 
 mitres and held pastoral staffs. We here see clearly, besides mere irreverence, 
 an outcrop of pagan practices. Topsy-turvydom, the temporary exaltation of 
 inferiors, was itself a characteristic of the Kalends celebrations, and a still 
 more remarkable feature of them was, as we have seen, the wearing of beast-masks 
 and the dressing up of men in women's clothes. And what is the “bishop” or 
 “archbishop” but a parallel to, and, we may well believe, an example of, the 
 mock king whom Dr. Frazer has traced in so many a folk-festival, and who is 
 found at the <i>Saturnalia</i>?</p>
 <p>One more feature of the Feast of Fools must be considered, the Ass who gave 
 to it the not uncommon title of <i>asinaria festa</i>. At Bourges, Sens, and 
 Beauvais, a curious half-comic hymn was sung in church, the so-called “Prose of 
 the Ass.” It begins as follows:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Orientis partibus</span><br><span class="i2">Adventavit Asinus,</span><br><span class="i2">Pulcher et 
 fortissimus,</span><br><span class="i2">Sarcinis aptissimus.</span><br><span class="i2">Hez, Sir Asnes, car chantez,</span><br><span class="i2">Belle bouche 
 rechignez,</span><br><span class="i2">Vous aurez du foin assez</span><br><span class="i2">Et de l'avoine a plantez.”</span><br></div></div>
 <p>And after eight verses in praise of the beast, with some mention of his 
 connection with Bethlehem and the Wise Men, it closes thus:﻿—</p>
 <div class="poem">
 <div class="stanza"><span class="i15">“Amen dicas, Asine,</span><br><span class="i2">Iam satur de gramine,<a name="page_305"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 305</font></a> <a name="Page_305"></a></span><br><span class="i2">Amen, Amen, 
 itera,</span><br><span class="i2">Aspernare vetera.</span><br><span class="i2">Hez 
 va, hez va! hez va, hez!</span><br><span class="i2">Bialx Sire Asnes, car 
 allez:</span><br><span class="i2">Belle bouche, car chantez.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-20">14-20</a><a name="Nanchor_14-20"></a> </span><br></div></div>
 <p>An ass, it would seem, was actually brought into church, at Beauvais at all 
 events, during the singing of this song on the feast of the Circumcision. On 
 January 14 an extraordinary ceremony took place there. A girl with a child 
 in her arms rode upon an ass into St. Stephen's church, to represent the Flight 
 into Egypt. The Introit, “Kyrie,” “Gloria,” and “Credo” at Mass ended in a bray, 
 and at the close of the service the priest instead of saying “Ite, missa est,” 
 had to bray three times, and the people to respond in like manner. Mr. 
 Chambers's theory is that the ass was a descendant of the <i>cervulus</i> or 
 hobby-buck who figures so largely in ecclesiastical condemnations of Kalends 
 customs.</p>
 <p>The country <i>par excellence</i> of the Feast of the Fools was France. It 
 can also be traced in Germany and Bohemia, while in England too there are 
 notices of it, though far fewer than in France. Its abuses were the subject of 
 frequent denunciations by Church reformers from the twelfth to the fifteenth 
 century. The feast was prohibited at various times, and notably by the Council 
 of Basle in 1435, but it was too popular to be quickly suppressed, and it took a 
 century and a half to die out after this condemnation by a general council of 
 the Church. In one cathedral, Amiens, it even lingered until 1721.</p>
 <p>When in the fifteenth century and later the Feast of Fools was expelled from 
 the churches of France, associations of laymen sprang up to carry on its 
 traditions outside. It was indeed a form of entertainment which the townsfolk as 
 well as the lower clergy thoroughly appreciated, and they were by no means 
 willing to let it die. A <i>Prince des Sots</i> took the place of the “bishop,” 
 and was chosen by <i>sociétés joyeuses</i> organized by the youth of the cities 
 for New Year merrymaking. Gradually their activities grew, and their 
 celebrations came to take place at other festive times beside the Christmas 
 season. The <i>sots</i> had a distinctive dress, its <a name="page_306"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 306</font></a> <a name="Page_306"></a>most characteristic feature being a hood with asses ears, 
 probably a relic of the primitive days when the heads of sacrificed animals were 
 worn by festal worshippers.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-21">14-21</a><a name="Nanchor_14-21"></a> </p>
 <h3 align="CENTER"><span class="smcap">The Boy Bishop.</span></h3>
 <p>Of older standing than the Feast of Fools were the Christmas revels of the 
 deacons, the priests, and the choir-boys. They can be traced back to the early 
 tenth century, and may have originated at the great song-school of St. Gall near 
 Constance. The most important of the three feasts was that of the boys on Holy 
 Innocents Day, a theoretically appropriate date. Corresponding to the “lord” of 
 the Feast of Fools was the famous “Boy Bishop,” a choir-boy chosen by the lads 
 themselves, who was vested in cope and mitre, held a pastoral staff, and gave 
 the benediction. Other boys too usurped the dignities of their elders, and were 
 attired as dean, archdeacons, and canons. Offices for the festival, in which the 
 Boy Bishop figures largely, are to be found in English, French, and German 
 service-books, the best known in this country being those in the Sarum 
 Processional and Breviary. In England these ceremonies were far more popular and 
 lasting than the Feast of Fools, and, unlike it, they were recognized and 
 approved by authority, probably because boys were more amenable to discipline 
 than men, and objectionable features could be pruned away with comparative ease. 
 The festivities must have formed a delightful break in the year of the mediaeval 
 schoolboy, for whom holidays, as distinguished from holy-days for church-going, 
 scarcely existed. The feast, as we shall see, was by no means confined within 
 the church walls; there was plenty of merrymaking and money-making outside.</p>
 <p>Minute details have been preserved of the Boy Bishop customs at St. Paul's 
 Cathedral in the thirteenth century. It had apparently been usual for the 
 “bishop” to make the cathedral dignitaries act as taper- and incense-bearers, 
 thus reversing matters so that the great performed the functions of the lowly. 
 In 1263 this was forbidden, and only clerks of lower rank might be chosen for 
 these offices. But the “bishop” had the right to demand <a name="page_307"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 307</font></a> <a name="Page_307"></a>after Compline on the Eve of the Innocents a supper for 
 himself and his train from the Dean or one of his canons. The number of his 
 following must, however, be limited; if he went to the Dean's he might take with 
 him a train of fifteen: two chaplains, two taper-bearers, five clerks, two 
 vergers, and four residentiary canons; if to a lesser dignitary his attendants 
 were to be fewer.</p>
 <p>On Innocents Day he was given a dinner, after which came a cavalcade through 
 the city, that the “bishop” might bless the people. He had also to preach a 
 sermon﻿—no doubt written for him.</p>
 <p>Examples of such discourses are still extant,﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-22">14-22</a><a name="Nanchor_14-22"></a> and are not without quaint touches. For instance the 
 bidding prayer before one of them alludes to “the ryghte reverende fader and 
 worshypfull lorde my broder Bysshopp of London, your dyoceasan,” and “my 
 worshypfull broder [the] Deane of this cathedrall chirche,”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-23">14-23</a><a name="Nanchor_14-23"></a> while in another the preacher remarks, speaking of 
 the choristers and children of the song-school, “Yt is not so long sens I was 
 one of them myself.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-24">14-24</a><a name="Nanchor_14-24"></a> </p>
 <p>In some places it appears, though this is by no means certain, that the boy 
 actually sang Mass. The “bishop's” office was a very desirable one not merely 
 because of the feasting, but because he had usually the right to levy 
 contributions on the faithful, and the amounts collected were often very large. 
 At York, for instance, in 1396 the “bishop” pocketed about £77, all expenses 
 paid.</p>
 <p>The general parallelism of the Boy Bishop customs and the Feast of Fools is 
 obvious, and no doubt they had much the same folk-origin. One point, already 
 mentioned, should specially be noticed: the election of the Boy Bishop generally 
 took place on December 5, the Eve of St. Nicholas, patron of children; he 
 was often called “Nicholas bishop”; and sometimes, as at Eton and Mayence, he 
 exercised episcopal functions at divine service on the eve and the feast itself. 
 It is possible, as Mr. Chambers suggests, that St. Nicholas's Day was an older 
 date for the boys festival than Holy Innocents, and that from the connection 
 with St. Nicholas, the bishop saint <i>par excellence</i> (he was said to have 
 been consecrated by divine command when still a mere layman), sprang <a name="page_308"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 308</font></a> <a name="Page_308"></a>the custom of giving the title “bishop” to the “lord” first 
 of the boys feast and later of the Feast of Fools.</p>
 <p>In the late Middle Ages the Boy Bishop was found not merely in cathedral, 
 monastic, and collegiate churches but in many parish churches throughout England 
 and Scotland. Various inventories of the vestments and ornaments provided for 
 him still exist. With the beginnings of the Reformation came his suppression: a 
 proclamation of Henry VIII., dated July 22, 1541, commands “that from 
 henceforth all suche superstitions be loste and clyerlye extinguisshed 
 throughowte all this his realmes and dominions, forasmoche as the same doo 
 resemble rather the unlawfull superstition of gentilitie [paganism], than the 
 pure and sincere religion of Christe.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-25">14-25</a><a name="Nanchor_14-25"></a> In Mary's reign the Boy Bishop reappeared, along 
 with other “Popish” usages, but after Elizabeth's accession he naturally fell 
 into oblivion. A few traces of him lingered in the seventeenth century. “The 
 Schoole-boies in the west,” says Aubrey, “still religiously observe St. Nicholas 
 day (Decemb. 6th), he was the Patron of the Schoole-boies. At Curry-Yeovill in 
 Somersetshire, where there is a Howschole (or schole) in the Church, they have 
 annually at that time a Barrell of good Ale brought into the church; and that 
 night they have the priviledge to breake open their Masters Cellar-dore.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-26">14-26</a><a name="Nanchor_14-26"></a> </p>
 <p>In France he seems to have gradually vanished, as, after the Reformation, the 
 Catholic Church grew more and more “respectable,” but traces of him are to be 
 found in the eighteenth century at Lyons and Rheims; and at Sens, even in the 
 nineteenth, the choir-boys used to play at being bishops on Innocents Day and 
 call their “archbishop” <i>âne</i>﻿—a memory this of the old <i>asinaria 
 festa</i>.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-27">14-27</a><a name="Nanchor_14-27"></a> In Denmark a vague trace of him was retained in the 
 nineteenth century in a children's game. A boy was dressed up in a white shirt, 
 and seated on a chair, and the children sang a verse beginning, “Here we 
 consecrate a Yule-bishop,” and offered him nuts and apples.﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_14-28">14-28</a><a name="Nanchor_14-28"></a> </p>
