 <h2 align="CENTER"><a name="POSTSCRIPT"></a>POSTSCRIPT</h2>
 <p>Before we pass on to the pagan aspects of Christmas, let us gather up our 
 thoughts in an attempt to realize the peculiar appeal of the Feast of the 
 Nativity, as it has been felt in the past, as it is felt to-day even by moderns 
 who have no belief in the historical truth of the story it commemorates.</p>
 <p>This appeal of Christmas seems to lie in the union of two modes of feeling 
 which may be called the <i>carol spirit</i> and the <i>mystical spirit</i>. The 
 <i>carol spirit</i>﻿—by this we may understand the simple, human joyousness, the 
 tender and graceful imagination, the kindly, intimate affection, which have 
 gathered round the cradle of the Christ Child. The folk-tune, the secular song 
 adapted to a sacred theme﻿—such is the carol. What a sense of kindliness, not of 
 sentimentality, but of genuine human feeling, these old songs give us, as though 
 the folk who first sang them were more truly comrades, more closely knit 
 together than we under modern industrialism.</p>
 <p>One element in the carol spirit is the rustic note that finds its sanction as 
 regards Christmas in St. Luke's story of the shepherds keeping watch over their 
 flocks by night. One thinks of the stillness over the fields, of the hinds with 
 their rough talk, “simply chatting in a rustic row,” of the keen air, and the 
 great burst of light and song that dazes their simple wits, of their journey to 
 Bethlehem where “the heaven-born Child all meanly wrapt in the rude manger 
 lies,” of the ox and ass linking the beasts of the field to the Christmas 
 adoration of mankind.﻿ <a href="crt24.htm#Footnote_80">80</a><a name="FNanchor_80"></a></p>
 <p>For many people, indeed, the charm of Christmas is inseparably associated 
 with the country; it is lost in London﻿—the city is too vast, too modern, too 
 sophisticated. It is bound up with the thought of frosty fields, of bells heard 
 far away, of bare trees <a name="page_156"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 156</font></a> <a name="Page_156"></a>against the starlit sky, of carols sung not by trained 
 choirs but by rustic folk with rough accent, irregular time, and tunes learnt by 
 ear and not by book.</p>
 <p>Again, without the idea of winter half the charm of Christmas would be gone. 
 Transplanted in the imagination of western Christendom from an undefined season 
 in the hot East to Europe at midwinter, the Nativity scenes have taken on a new 
 pathos with the thought of the bitter cold to which the great Little One lay 
 exposed in the rough stable, with the contrast between the cold and darkness of 
 the night and the fire of love veiled beneath that infant form. <i>Lux in 
 tenebris</i> is one of the strongest notes of Christmas: in the bleak midwinter 
 a light shines through the darkness; when all is cold and gloom, the sky bursts 
 into splendour, and in the dark cave is born the Light of the World.</p>
 <p>There is the idea of royalty too, with all it stands for of colour and 
 magnificence, though not so much in literature as in painting is this side of 
 the Christmas story represented. The Epiphany is the great opportunity for 
 imaginative development of the regal idea. Then is seen the union of utter 
 poverty with highest kingship; the monarchs of the East come to bow before the 
 humble Infant for whom the world has found no room in the inn. How suggestive by 
 their long, slow syllables are the Italian names of the Magi. Gasparre, 
 Baldassarre, Melchiorre﻿—we picture Oriental monarchs in robes mysteriously 
 gorgeous, wrought with strange patterns, heavy with gold and precious stones. 
 With slow processional motion they advance, bearing to the King of Kings their 
 symbolic gifts, gold for His crowning, incense for His worship, myrrh for His 
 mortality, and with them come the mystery, colour, and perfume of the East, the 
 occult wisdom which bows itself before the revelation in the Child.</p>
 <p>Above all, as the foregoing pages have shown, it is the <i>childhood</i> of 
 the Redeemer that has won the heart of Europe for Christmas; it is the appeal to 
 the parental instinct, the love for the tender, weak, helpless, yet 
 all-potential babe, that has given the Church's festival its strongest hold. And 
 this side of Christmas is penetrated often by the <i>mystical spirit</i>﻿—that 
 sense of the Infinite in the finite without which the highest human life is 
 impossible.</p>
 <p><a name="page_157"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 157</font></a> <a name="Page_157"></a>The feeling for Christmas varies from mere delight in the 
 Christ Child as a representative symbol on which to lavish affection, as a child 
 delights in a doll, to the mystical philosophy of Eckhart, in whose Christmas 
 sermons the Nativity is viewed as a type of the Birth of God in the depths of 
 man's being. Yet even the least spiritual forms of the cult of the Child are 
 seldom without some hint of the supersensual, the Infinite, and even in Eckhart 
 there is a love of concrete symbolism. Christmas stands peculiarly for the 
 sacramental principle that the outward and visible is a sign and shadow of the 
 inward and spiritual. It means the seeing of common, earthly things shot through 
 by the glory of the Infinite. “Its note,” as has been said of a stage of the 
 mystic consciousness, the Illuminative Way, “is sacramental not ascetic. It 
 entails ... the discovery of the Perfect One ablaze in the Many, not the 
 forsaking of the Many in order to find the One ... an ineffable radiance, a 
 beauty and a reality never before suspected, are perceived by a sort of 
 clairvoyance shining in the meanest things.”﻿ <a href="crt22.htm#Note_6-1">6-1</a><a name="Nanchor_6-1"></a> Christmas is the festival of the Divine Immanence, and 
 it is natural that it should have been beloved by the saint and mystic whose 
 life was the supreme manifestation of the <i>Via Illuminativa</i>, Francis of 
 Assisi.</p>
 <p>Christmas is the most human and lovable of the Church's feasts. Easter and 
 Ascensiontide speak of the rising and exaltation of a glorious being, clothed in 
 a spiritual body refined beyond all comparison with our natural flesh; 
 Whitsuntide tells of the coming of a mysterious, intangible Power﻿—like the 
 wind, we cannot tell whence It cometh and whither It goeth; Trinity offers for 
 contemplation an ineffable paradox of Pure Being. But the God of Christmas is no 
 ethereal form, no mere spiritual essence, but a very human child, feeling the 
 cold and the roughness of the straw, needing to be warmed and fed and cherished. 
 Christmas is the festival of the natural body, of this world; it means the 
 consecration of the ordinary things of life, affection and comradeship, eating 
 and drinking and merrymaking; and in some degree the memory of the Incarnation 
 has been able to blend with the pagan joyance of the New Year.</p>
