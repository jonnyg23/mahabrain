 <p>I sing of rich-haired Demeter, lady of the glorious fruits,<br> Of her and her trim-ankled daughter Persephone<br> First of all to travel the roads of the Bardos to the land of death and back.</p>  
 <p>Persephone was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters of Oceanus<br> And gathering flowers over a soft meadow, roses and crocuses<br> And beautiful violets, irises also and hyacinths and the narcissus<br> Which Earth made to grow to please the Goddess.</p>  
 <p>The Narcissus was a marvelous, radiant flower.<br> It was a thing of awe whether for deathless goddesses or mortal women to see:<br> From its root grew a hundred blooms and it smelled most sweetly,<br> So that all wide heaven above and the whole earth and the sea's salt swell laughed for joy.<br> And the girl was amazed and reached out with both hands to take the lovely toy.</p>  
 <p>But the wide-pathed earth yawned there and Kali, with her immortal horses<br> sprang out upon her, the Daughter of the Creatrix, She who has many names,<br> She is the destroyer of worlds, eater of universes.</p>  
 <p>Kali caught her up reluctant on her golden car and bare her away lamenting.<br> Then Persephone cried out shrilly with her voice, calling upon her mother,<br> Demeter, who is most high and excellent.<br> But no one, either of the deathless goddesses or of mortal women, heard her voice,<br> nor yet the olive-trees bearing rich fruit: only tender-hearted Hecate,<br> Bright-coiffed, the daughter of Gaia, heard the girl from her cave.</p>  
 <p>And so long as she, the goddess, yet beheld earth and starry heaven<br> And the strong-flowing sea where fishes shoal, and the rays of the sun,<br> And still hoped to see her dear mother and the tribes of the eternal gods,<br> So long hope calmed her great heart for all her trouble<br> And the heights of the mountains and the depths of the sea<br> Rang with her immortal voice: and her queenly mother heard her.</p>  
 <p>Bitter pain seized her heart, and she rent the covering upon her divine hair<br> With her dear hands: her dark cloak she cast down from both her shoulders and sped,<br> Like a wild-bird, over the firm land and yielding sea, seeking her child.<br> But no one could tell her the truth, neither goddess nor mortal woman;<br> And of the birds of omen none came with true news for her.<br> Then for nine days queenly Demeter wandered over the earth<br> With flaming torches in her hands, so grieved that she never tasted<br> Ambrosia and the sweet draught of nectar, nor sprinkled her body with water.<br> But when the tenth enlightening dawn had come,<br> Hecate, with a torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to her and told her news:</p>  
 <p>"Queenly Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of good gifts,<br> What goddess of heaven or what mortal woman has taken away Persephone<br> And pierced with sorrow your dear heart?<br> For I heard her voice, yet saw not with my eyes who it was.<br> But I tell you truly and shortly all I know."</p>  
 <p>So, then, said Hecate. And Demeter answered her not,<br> But sped swiftly with her, holding flaming torches in her hands.<br> So they came to Amaterasu, who is watcher of both goddesses and women,<br> And stood in front of her horses: and the bright goddess enquired of her:<br> "Amaterasu, do you at least regard me, goddess as I am,<br> If ever by word or deed of mine I have cheered your heart and spirit.<br> Through the fruitless air I heard the anguished cry of my daughter whom I bare,<br> Sweet scion of my body and lovely in form,<br> As of one seized violently; though with my eyes I saw nothing.<br> But you--for with your beams you look down from the bright upper air<br> Over all the earth and sea--tell me truly<br> Of my dear child if you have seen her anywhere,<br> What goddess or mortal woman has violently seized her<br> Against her will and mine, and so made off."</p>  
 <p>So said she. And the Sun Goddess answered her:<br> "Queen Demeter, lover of rich-haired Gaia,<br> I will tell you the truth; for I greatly reverence<br> And pity you in your grief for your trim-ankled daughter.<br> None other of the deathless goddesses is to blame,<br> Terrible Kali, destroyer of universes,<br> Alone seized her and took her loudly crying in her chariot<br> Down to her realm of mist and gloom.<br> So goddess, cease your loud lament<br> And keep not vain anger unrelentingly.<br> For Kali is unrelenting; her very touch<br> Would turn my world burning fires to ash.</p>  
 <p>But grief yet more terrible and savage came into the heart of Demeter,<br> And thereafter she was so angered with the dark-clouded Kali<br> That she avoided the gathering of the Goddesses,<br> And went to the towns and rich fields of women,<br> Disfiguring her form a long while.<br> And no deep-bosomed women knew her when they saw her,<br> Until she came to the fragrant town of Eleusis, in ocean-girded Crete.<br> Vexed in her dear heart, she sat near the wayside by the Maiden Well,<br> From which the women of the place were used to draw water,<br> In a shady place over which grew an olive shrub.<br> And she was shrouded in the form of an elder woman<br> Who is cut off from childbearing and the gifts of garland-loving Aphrodite,<br> There the daughters of Eleusis, saw her,<br> As they coming for easy-drawn water,<br> To carry it in pitchers of bronze to their dear mother's house:<br> Four were they and like goddesses in the flower of their girlhood,<br> Callidice and Cleisidice and lovely Demo and Callithoe<br> Who was the eldest of them all.<br> They knew her not,--for the goddesses are not easily discerned by mortals<br> But startling near by her spoke winged words:<br> "Old mother, whence are you of folk born long ago?<br> Why are you gone away from the city and do not draw near the houses?<br> For there in the shady halls are women of just such age as you,<br> And others younger; and they would welcome you both by word and by deed."</p>  
 <p>Thus they said. And she, Demeter, queen among goddesses answered them saying:<br> "Hail, dear children, whosoever you are of woman-kind.<br> I will tell you my story; for it is not unseemly that I should tell you truly what you ask.<br> Doso is my name, for my stately mother gave it me.<br> And now I am come from Crete over the sea's wide back,<br> Not willingly; but pirates brought me thence by force of strength against my liking.<br> Afterwards they put in with their swift craft,<br> And these the women landed on the shore in full throng<br> And they began to make ready a meal by the stern-cables of the ship.<br> But my heart craved not pleasant food,<br> And I fled secretly across the dark country and escaped my captors,<br> That they should not take me across the sea against my will.<br> And so I wandered and am come here:<br> And I know not at all what land this is or what people are in it.<br> But may all those who dwell on high give you birth of children<br> When and where you desire,<br> So you take pity on me, maidens,<br> And show me this clearly that I may learn, dear children,<br> To the house of what woman I may go,<br> To work for them cheerfully at such tasks<br> As belong to a woman of my age.<br> Well could I nurse a new born child, holding her in my arms,<br> Or keep house, or teach, or any other profession requiring the wisdom of age."</p>  
 <p>So said the goddess. And straightway the unwed maiden Callidice,<br> Goodliest in form of the daughters of Eleusis, answered her and said:</p>  
 <p>"Mother, what the Goddess send us, we mortals bear perforce,<br> Although we suffer; for they are much stronger than we.<br> If you will, stay here; and we will go to our mother's house<br> And tell Metaneira, our deep-bosomed mother,<br> All this matter fully, that she may bid you rather<br> Come to our home than search after the houses of others.<br> She has an only daughter, late-born, who is being nursed in our well-built house,<br> A child of many hopes and welcome:<br> If you could bring her up until she reached the full measure of youth,<br> Any one of womankind who should see you would straightway envy you,<br> Such gifts would our mother give for her upbringing."</p>  
 <p>So she spoke: and the goddess bowed her head in assent.<br> And they filled their shining vessels with water and carried them off rejoicing.<br> Quickly they came to their mother's great house<br> And straightway told their mother according as they had heard and seen.<br> Then she bade them go with all speed and invite the stranger to come for a measureless hire.<br> As hinds or heifers in spring time, when sated with pasture,<br> Bound about a meadow, so they, holding up the folds of their lovely garments,<br> Darted down the hollow path, and their hair like a crocus flower streamed about their shoulders.<br> And they found the good goddess near the wayside where they had left her before,<br> And led her to the house of their dear mother.<br> And she walked behind, distressed in her dear heart,<br> With her head veiled and wearing a dark cloak which<br> Waved about the slender feet of the goddess.</p>  
 <p>Soon they came to the house and went through the portico<br> To where their queenly mother sat by a pillar of the close-fitted roof, <br> Holding her daughter, a tender scion, in her bosom.<br> And the girls ran to her.<br> But the goddess walked to the threshold:<br> And her head reached the roof and she filled the doorway with a heavenly radiance.<br> Then awe and reverence and pale fear took hold of Metaneira,<br> And she rose up from her couch before Demeter, and bade her be seated.<br> But Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of perfect gifts,<br> Would not sit upon the bright couch,<br> But stayed silent with lovely eyes cast down until careful Iambe<br> Placed a jointed seat for her and threw over it a silvery fleece.<br> Then she sat down and held her veil in her hands before her face.<br> A long time she sat upon the stool without speaking because of her sorrow,<br> And greeted no one by word or by sign, but rested, never smiling,<br> And tasting neither food nor drinks because she pined with longing<br> For her deep-bosomed daughter Persephone, until careful Iambe--<br> Who pleased her moods in aftertime also--<br> Moved the holy lady with many a quip and jest to smile and laugh and cheer her heart.<br> Then Metaneira filled a cup with sweet wine and offered it to her;<br> And Metaneira mixed the draught and gave it to the goddess as she bade.<br> So the great queen Demeter received it to observe the sacrament.</p>  
 <p>And of them all, well-girded Metaneira first began to speak:<br> "Hail, lady! For I think you are not meanly but nobly born;<br> Truly dignity and grace are conspicuous upon your eyes as<br> In the eyes of kings that deal justice.<br> Yet we mortals bear perforce what the fates send us,<br> Though we be grieved; for a yoke is set upon our necks.<br> But now, since you are come here, you shall have what I can bestow:<br> And nurse me this child whom the gods gave me in my old age and beyond my hope,<br> A daughter much hoped for. If you should bring her up until<br> She reach the full measure of youth,<br> Any one of woman-kind that sees you will straightway envy you,<br> So great reward would I give for her upbringing."</p>  
 <p>Then rich-haired Demeter answered her:<br> "And to you, also, lady, all hail, and may the Goddess give you good!<br> Gladly will I take the girl to my breast, as you bid me, and will nurse her.<br> Never, I promise, through any heedlessness of his nurse shall evil hurt her<br> For I know an excellent safeguard against woeful demons."</p>  
 <p>When she had so spoken, she took the child in her fragrant bosom<br> With her divine hands: and her mother was glad in her heart.<br> So the goddess nursed in the palace the daughter whom well-girded Metaneira bare.<br> And the child grew like some immortal being,<br> Not fed with food nor nourished at the breast:<br> For by day rich-crowned Demeter would anoint her with ambrosia<br> As if she were the offspring of a goddess and breathe sweetly upon her<br> As she held her in her bosom.<br> But at night she would hide her like a brand in the heart of the fire,<br> Unknown to her dear parents.<br> And it wrought great wonder in these that she grew beyond her age;<br> For she was like the goddess face to face.<br> And she would have made her deathless and unaging,<br> Had not well-girded Metaneira in her heedlessness<br> Kept watch by night from her sweet-smelling chamber and spied.<br> But she wailed and smote her two hips, because she feared for her daughter<br> And was greatly distraught in her heart; so she lamented and uttered winged words:<br> "My daughter, the strange woman buries you deep in fire<br> And works grief and bitter sorrow for me."</p>  
 <p>Thus she spoke, mourning.<br> And the bright goddess, lovely-crowned Demeter, heard her, and was wroth with her.<br> So with her divine hands she snatched from the fire<br> The dear daughter whom Metaneira had born unhoped--<br> For she was terribly angry in her heart.<br> Forthwith she said to well-girded Metaneira:</p>  
 <p>"Witless are you mortals and dull to foresee your lot,<br> Whether of good or evil, that comes upon you.<br> For now in your heedlessness you have wrought folly past healing;<br> For--be witness the oath of the goddess, the relentless water of death-- <br> I would have made your dear daughter deathless and unaging all her days<br> And would have bestowed on her ever-lasting honor,<br> But now she can in no way escape death and the fates.<br> Yet shall unfailing honor always rest upon her,<br> Because she lay upon my knees and slept in my arms.<br> But, as the years move round and when she is in his prime,<br> The daughters of the Eleusinians shall ever wage war<br> And dread strife with one another continually.<br> Lo! I am that Demeter who has share of honor<br> And is the greatest help and cause of joy to the undying goddesses and mortal women.<br> But now, let all the people build me a great temple and an altar below it<br> And beneath the city and its sheer wall upon a rising hillock.<br> And I myself will teach my rites,<br> That hereafter you may reverently perform them and so win the favor of my heart."</p>  
 <p>When she had so said, the goddess changed her stature and her looks,<br> Thrusting old age away from her:<br> Beauty spread round about her<br> And a lovely fragrance was wafted from her sweet-smelling robes,<br> And from the divine body of the goddess a light shone afar,<br> While golden tresses spread down over her shoulders,<br> So that the strong house was filled with brightness as with lightning.<br> And so she went out from the palace.</p>  
 <p>And straightway Metaneira's knees were loosed<br> And she remained speechless for a long while<br> And did not remember to pick up her late-born daughter.<br> But his sisters heard her pitiful wailing and sprang down from their well-spread beds:<br> One of them took up the child in her arms and laid her in her bosom,<br> While another revived the fire,<br> And a third rushed with soft feet to bring their mother from her fragrant chamber.<br> And they gathered about the struggling child and washed her,<br> Embracing her lovingly; but she was not comforted,<br> Because nurses and handmaids much less skillful were holding her now.</p>  
 <p>All night long they sought to appease the glorious goddess, quaking with fear.<br> But, as soon as dawn began to show, they started the labor that<br> Lovely-crowned goddess Demeter charged them.<br> So countless people to came an assembly<br> And they raised a goodly temple for rich-haired Demeter<br> And an altar upon the rising hillock.<br> As for the child, she grew like an immortal being.</p>  
 <p>Now when they had finished building and had drawn back from their toil,<br> They went every one to their house.<br> But golden-haired Demeter sat there apart from all the blessed gods and stayed,<br> Wasting with yearning for her deep-bosomed daughter.<br> Then she caused a most dreadful and cruel year for humanity<br> Over the all-nourishing earth:</p>  
 <p>She cloaked the Sun, Moon and Stars<br> With endless clouds of dark and roiling aspect<br> So little light was seen at noon<br> It was like the gloom of twilight<br> The ground would not make the seed sprout,<br> For rich-crowned Demeter kept it hid.<br> In the fields the oxen drew many a curved plough in vain,<br> And much white barley was cast upon the land without avail.<br> So she would have destroyed the whole earth with cruel famine<br> Had not Amaterasu perceived and marked this in her heart.<br> First she sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter, lovely in form.<br> So she commanded. And she obeyed the dark-clouded sky-mother,<br> And sped with swift feet across the space between.<br> She came to the stronghold of fragrant Eleusis,<br> And there finding dark-cloaked Demeter in her temple,<br> Spoke to her and uttered winged words:</p>  
 <p>"Demeter, Mother Amaterasu, whose wisdom is everlasting,<br> Calls you to come join the councils of the eternal goddesses:<br> Come therefore, and let not the message I bring from Amaterasu pass unobeyed."</p>  
 <p>Thus said Iris imploring her.<br> But Demeter's heart was not moved.<br> Then again the sky-mother sent forth all the blessed and eternal goddesses besides:<br> And they came, one after the other, and kept calling her<br> And offering many very beautiful gifts<br> And whatever rights she might be pleased to choose among the deathless goddesses.<br> Yet no one was able to persuade her mind and will, so wroth was she in her heart;<br> But she stubbornly rejected all their words:<br> For she vowed that she would never set foot in the Grove<br> Nor let fruit spring out of the ground,<br> Until she beheld with her eyes her own fair-faced daughter.</p>  
 <p>Now when all-seeing Amaterasu the sky-Goddess heard this,<br> She sent for Athena, wise and powerful<br> To win over Kali with soft words, that she might lead forth chaste Persephone<br> To the light from the misty gloom to join the gods,<br> And that Demeter, her mother might see her with her eyes and cease from her anger.<br> And Athena obeyed, and leaving the Grove of the Goddess,<br> Straightway sprang down with speed to the hidden places of the earth.<br> And she found the Ruler of the misty Bardos in her house seated upon a couch,<br> And her shy companion, Persephone, with her, much reluctant,<br> Because she yearned for her mother.<br> But she was afar off, brooding on her fell design because of the deeds of the blessed gods.<br> And wise Athena drew near and said:</p>  
 <p>"Dark-haired Kali, ruler over the departed,<br> Mother Amaterasu bids me bring noble Persephone<br> Forth from the Bardos unto the Grove,<br> That her mother may see her with her eyes<br> And cease from her dread anger with the immortals;<br> For now she plans an awful deed,<br> To destroy the weakly tribes of earth-born women<br> By keeping seed hidden beneath the earth,<br> And so she makes an end of the human race.<br> For she keeps fearful anger and does not consort with the goddesses,<br> But sits aloof in her fragrant temple, dwelling in the rocky hold of Eleusis."</p>  
 <p>So she said. And skull-garlanded Kali, ruler over the dead,<br> Smiled grimly and obeyed the behest of Amaterasu.<br> For she straightway urged wise Persephone, saying:</p>  
 <p>"Go now, Persephone, to your dark-robed mother,<br> Go, and feel kindly in your heart towards me:<br> For I am not a jealous Goddess<br> Be not so exceedingly cast down;<br> For I shall be no unfitting companion for you among the deathless goddesses,<br> That am own sister to the sky-mother.<br> And while you are here, you shall rule all that lives and moves<br> And shall have the greatest rights among the deathless goddesses:<br> Those who defraud you and do not appease your power with offerings,<br> Reverently performing rites and paying fit gifts, shall be reborn into lower forms."</p>  
 <p>When she said this, wise Persephone was filled with joy and hastily sprang up for gladness.<br> But Kali on her part secretly gave her a sweet pomegranate seed to eat,<br> Taking care for herself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-robed Demeter.<br> Then Kali the destroyer openly got ready her deathless horses beneath the golden chariots.<br> And she mounted on the chariot and Athena took reins in her hands<br> And drove forth from the hall of the judgement, the horses speeding readily.<br> Swiftly they traversed their long course,<br> And neither the sea nor river-waters<br> Nor grassy glens nor mountain-peaks<br> Checked the career of the immortal horses,<br> But they clave the deep air above them as they went.<br> And Athena brought them to the place where rich-crowned Demeter<br> Was staying and checked them before her fragrant temple.</p>  
 <p>And when Demeter saw them, she rushed forth<br> As does a Maenad down some thick-wooded mountain,<br> While Persephone on the other side,<br> When she saw her mother's sweet eyes,<br> Left the chariot and horses, and leaped down to run to her,<br> And falling upon her neck, embraced her.<br> But while Demeter was still holding her dear child in her arms,<br> Her heart suddenly misgave her for some snare,<br> So that she feared greatly and ceased embracing her daughter<br> And asked of her at once:<br> "My child, tell me, surely you have not tasted any food while you were below?<br> Speak out and hide nothing, but let us both know.<br> For if you have not, you shall come back from the misty halls of death<br> And live with me again, and be honored by all the deathless goddesses;<br> But if you have tasted food, you must go back again beneath seething foam,<br> There to dwell a third part of the seasons every year:<br> Yet for the two parts you shall be with me and the other deathless gods.<br> But when the earth shall bloom with the fragrant flowers of spring in every kind,<br> Then from the realm of darkness and gloom thou shalt come up<br> Once more to be a wonder for goddesses and mortal women.<br> And now tell me how Kali spirited you away<br> To the realm of darkness and gloom,<br> And by what trick did the strong destroyer of time and space beguile you?"</p>  
 <p>Then beautiful Persephone answered her thus:<br> "Mother, I will tell you all without error.<br> When luck-bringing Athena came, swift messenger from Amaterasu<br> And the other Daughters of Heaven,<br> Bidding me come back from the world between thew worlds<br> That you might see me with your eyes<br> And so cease from your anger and fearful wrath against the gods,<br> I sprang up at once for joy; but she secretly put in my mouth sweet food,<br> A pomegranate seed, and forced me to taste against my will.<br> Also I will tell how she carried me off beneath the depths of the earth,<br> And will relate the whole matter as you ask.<br> All we were playing in a lovely meadow,<br> Leucippe and Phaeno and Electra and Ianthe, Melita also<br> And Iache with Rhodea and Callirhoe and Melobosis<br> And Tyche and Ocyrhoe, fair as a flower, Chryseis, Ianeira,<br> Acaste and Admete and Rhodope and charming Calypso; and Urania<br> And Artemis delighting in arrows.<br> We were playing and gathering sweet flowers in our hands,<br> Soft crocuses mingled with irises and hyacinths,<br> And rose-blooms and lilies, marvelous to see,<br> And the narcissus which the wide earth caused to grow yellow as a crocus.<br> That I plucked in my joy; but the earth parted beneath,<br> And there the strong Goddess, Kali, destroyer of worlds,<br> Sprang forth and in her golden chariot she bore me away,<br> All unwilling, beneath the earth: then I cried with a shrill cry.<br> All this is true, sore though it grieves me to tell the tale."</p>  
 <p>So did they then, with hearts at one, greatly cheer each the other's soul<br> And spirit with many an embrace: their hearts had relief from their griefs<br> While each took and gave back joyousness.</p>  
 <p>Then bright-coiffed Hecate came near to them,<br> And she embraced the daughter of holy Demeter:<br> And from that time the lady Hecate was<br> Companion to Persephone.</p>  
 <p>And all-seeing Amaterasu sent a messenger to them,<br> Rich-haired Rhea, to bring dark-cloaked Demeter to the Grove of the Goddess:<br> And she promised to give her what rights she should choose among the deathless devas<br> And agreed that her daughter should go down for the third part of the circling year<br> To darkness and gloom, but for the two parts should live with her mother<br> And the other deathless goddesses.<br> Thus the Sky-Mother commanded.<br> And the goddess did not disobey the message of Amaterasu;<br> Swiftly she rushed down from the Grove of the Goddess<br> Came to the plain of Earth, rich, fertile corn-land once,<br> But then in nowise fruitful, for it lay idle and utterly leafless,<br> Because the white grain was hidden by design of trim-ankled Demeter.<br> But afterwards, as spring-time waxed,<br> It was soon to be waving with long ears of corn,<br> And its rich furrows to be loaded with grain upon the ground,<br> While others would already be bound in sheaves.<br> There first she landed from the fruitless upper air:<br> And glad were the goddesses to see each other and cheered in heart.<br> Then bright-coiffed Rhea said to Demeter:</p>  
 <p>"Come for far-seeing Amaterasu the Sky-Mother calls you to join us in the Grove of the Goddess,<br> And has promised to give you what rights you please<br> And has agreed that for a third part of the circling year<br> Your daughter shall go down to darkness and gloom,<br> But for the two parts shall be with you and the other deathless gods:<br> So has she declared it shall be and has bowed her head in token.<br> But come, my lover, obey, and be not too<br> Angry unrelentingly with the skull-wreathed Kali;<br> But rather increase forthwith for women the fruit that gives them life."</p>  
 <p>So spoke Rhea.<br> And rich-crowned Demeter did not refuse but straightway made<br> Fruit to spring up from the rich lands,<br> So that the whole wide earth was laden with leaves and flowers.<br> Then she went, and she showed the conduct of her rites<br> And taught women all her mysteries,--<br> Awful mysteries which no one may in any way transgress or pry into or utter,<br> For deep awe of the goddess checks the voice.<br> Happy is she among women upon earth who has seen these mysteries;<br> but she who is uninitiated and who has no part in them,<br> Never has lot of like good things once she is dead,<br> Down in the darkness and gloom.</p>  
 <p>But when the bright goddess had taught them all,<br> She went to the Grove of the Goddess.<br> And there she dwelt beside Amaterasu who delights in fire,<br> Awe inspiring and reverend Goddess.</p>  
 <p>Right blessed is she among women on earth<br> Whom can freely love without jealousy.<br> Share your love as Demeter, Kali and Hecate<br> Share the love of Persephone.<br> For jealousy weighs down your heart<br> And your heart is weighed on Kali's scales<br> If it exceeds the weight of a pomegranate seed<br> You will be sent to wander the misty Bardos<br> For endless cycles of rebirth<br> And if you have learned to share your love<br> You will be taken to the Grove of the Goddess,<br> And you shall be as a Goddess.<br> This is the sum of all mysteries.</p>
