 <p>As religious beliefs must be understood before one can appreciate social customs, behavior patterns, value systems, taboos, etc., a brief study of Roman Catholicism in Vietnam is relevant. This is especially true in view of the fact that Roman Catholicism is the oldest form of Christianity in Vietnam. As a factor in Vietnamese history for several centuries, it has been and now is a religious force which requires the attention of those who seek to understand the internal situation.</p>  
 <p>The Roman Catholic Church stated that, as of the end of 1965, 10.5% (approximately 1,600,000) of all the South Vietnamese Republic's present population are members. Therefore, the Church, influencing its people by leadership in moral, ethical, spiritual, and educational realms, constitutes a force which must be considered in the political, military, social, and economic decisions of an awakening nation. In 1966 the Roman Catholic Church of South Vietnam had two Archbishops with administrative offices at Saigon and Hue, and twenty Bishops who oversaw the pastoral work of 1,771 priests and the work of 4,026 nuns of the various orders. Across the 17th Parallel, the Roman Catholic Church has an Archbishop and an archdiocese at Hanoi, some nine dioceses and thirteen Bishops; but this study is oriented basically to South Vietnam, except where the Church's Vietnamese history requires inclusion of the north since the church early established in Tonkin a strong base. The various decrees affecting Catholicism were issued by the royal rulers dwelling at Hanoi for most of Roman Catholicism's Vietnamese history.</p>  
 <p>Spokesmen of the Church point out that the theology of the Church is universal and therefore no differences exist insofar as mass, etc., are involved. They also observe that cultural patterns not in conflict with Church law or theology may be practiced by adherents of the faith. Thus the ancestor shelf of veneration with minor physical modifications and emphasis is found in the home of nearly every Vietnamese except for the animistic tribespeople and the Protestants.</p>  
 <p>The comparatively strong educational program of the Church tends to place many of its graduates near the top of economic, cultural, political and academic areas of Vietnamese life except where the dynamics of religious forces gravitate against them. As governmental educational institutions develop and assume a molding influence, the effect of Church-oriented education will not be so obvious, which may lessen the tension which currently seems to exist in varying degrees throughout South Vietnam.</p>  
 <p>The Church's figures of 101,010 catechists, 189,930 baptisms and 19,293 marriages for 1963 is considered about normal according to one Vietnamese Roman Catholic Bishop. Yet the course of the war and political strife undoubtedly has an effect upon the Church even as it does upon the individual Vietnamese throughout Vietnam. While the death rate or apostasy figures have not been included, they are involved in computation of Church growth according to hierarchy spokesmen.</p>
