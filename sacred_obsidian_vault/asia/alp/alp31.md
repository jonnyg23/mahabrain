 <p></p><dir>I HAVE a word I fain would say--list patiently, Light of my Eyes;<br> A ceaseless longing fills my heart thy face to see, Light of my Eyes.<br> How have I sinned that thou shouldst thus offended be, Light of my Eyes<br> The world is sated with the world,--I starve for thee, Light of my Eyes.  
 <p>A sea of blood is in my heart, and tears forever fill my eyes;<br> No salve can heal my wound, the cure in my beloved's presence lies.<br> All sick of love I lay, and watched her pathway with my longing eyes;<br> When I was dead she came; ’twas but the layer-out who heard her sighs.</p>  
 <p>Fair springtime now is fully here, the meadows gay with leaf and flower;<br> The hill-sides strewn with violets, the nightingale sent to the bower.<br> But why cannot his voice be heard id O thorn-tree, whence thy cruel power?<br> Thy branches pierced . his heart; the rose was mourning left within her tower.</p>  
 <p>The scarlet poppy thought to tempt and lure the wandering nightingale,<br> When he was dreaming of the rose tied round with wisps of basil pale.<br> None pitied him--the rose was plucked by those who first came to the vale.<br> Alas, poor nightingale, the hedge has caught and pierced thy body frail!</p>  
 <p>God knows my life I count but nought; for thee I'd give it joyfully.<br> Come, let us taste of love's delights, let him that listeth envious be.<br> No wish of thine shall be refused, so but thy face I radiant see.<br> If immortality thou’dst have, my love shall e’en bring that to thee.</p>  
 <p>And if I had a thousand woes no murmur from my lips would rise:<br> Thou art my Ruler, none beside; no sovereign own I otherwise.<br> Sayat Nova says, "Heartless one, death is not death for him who dies<br> So thou but mourn him with thy locks spread over him, Light of my Eyes."</p></dir>
