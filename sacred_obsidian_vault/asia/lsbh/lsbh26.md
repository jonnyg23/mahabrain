 <p align="center">[The following verses are not found in the India Office Ms.]</p>  
 <p align="center">EXHORTATION TO A LIFE OF EXCELLENCE.</p>  
 <p>As a mourner weeping thou didst enter the world on the day of thy birth,<br> Though thou didst bring joy and laughter to thy kinsfolk;<br> Take care that thou art joyful and innocent on the day of thy death,<br> When they are weeping and wailing by reason of thy 5 departure.</p>  
 <p align="center">THE WORTHLESSNESS OF [THIS] FLEETING LIFE.</p>  
 <p>The [days of] men's lives are few and evil, as hath been said,<br> And are for the most part, [full of] toil, and pain, and suffering, and disgrace.<br> Childhood hath [its] faults and stripes of correction; And manhood its fatiguing passions and goadings of 10 the flesh;<br> And in old age sickness and pain wear [a man] to nothing.<br> Then, straightway, death snatcheth [him] away to the storehouse of the grave,<br> And, behold, there are for him henceforth either the awful judgment, and the fiery furnace,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_188"><font size="1" color="green">p. 188</font></a></p>  
 <p>And the torment and the thick darkness wherein there is no light,<br> 15 Or happiness with the angels in the shining heavens.</p>  
 <p align="center">ON THE TRANSIENT NATURE OF [THIS] WORLD.</p>  
 <p>The moon, by reason of her phases, may be taken as a type of man.<br> She cometh into being, she waxeth, she groweth old,<br> she dieth, and is as if she had never been.<br> The course of her hours daily depicteth the form of the end,<br> 20 And teacheth us that in the same manner the world<br> and the things thereof must pass away.</p>  
 <p align="center">ON DEATH AND THE RESURRECTION.</p>  
 <p>The mornings and the evenings without written words depict<br> The story of death and of the resurrection by means of things which are visible.<br> Night, like death, cometh upon all beings and creatures,<br> 25 And spreadeth out over all rest and silence and tranquillity.<br> He carrieth away the crowns of exalted kings shamelessly,<br> And all the ranks of mighty men sink to rest at his approach.<br> He depriveth thrones also of their splendour,<br> And from princes he demandeth tax and tribute.<br> 30 He maketh merchants to cease suddenly from travelling,<br> And handicraftsmen also from their trades and handicrafts.<br> He sheweth the way to all husbandmen coming from their fields,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_189"><font size="1" color="green">p. 189</font></a></p>  
 <p>And work and tillage upon all homesteads come to an end.<br> He burieth every man in his bed as if he were dead,<br> And he draweth over his face the gate of sleep as it 35 were a curtain.<br> He bindeth on crowns and is boastful, and commandeth all creation,<br> And he subdueth the sceptres of sea and of land [to his] dominion.<br> He maketh the earth to appear unformed, and waste, and void,<br> And he stilleth the clamour of all those who are prosperous through trafficking.<br> And as with colour he depicteth to every man the 40 type of the end,<br> And how the course of the world and of the vault of heaven will cease.<br> Morn riseth like unto the sun of righteousness,<br> And with his beams he driveth away the night from the ends of the earth.<br> Like a trumpet the light it beareth forth into the inhabited world,<br> And men rise up from sleep as out of the grave. 45<br> Suddenly each man possesseth himself of life and wakefulness,<br> And every one pursueth his labours with zeal and diligence.<br> Morn commandeth the earth to beget its offspring from the womb of night,<br> And each man riseth up to the things which belong to him in due order;<br> The rich man riseth up to his riches and the poor man 50 to his poverty without confusion.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_190"><font size="1" color="green">p. 190</font></a></p>  
 <p>Morn painteth the picture of the great day of the Resurrection,<br> And sheweth how every man will possess the [fruit of] his labour from justice.</p>  
 <p align="center">OF THE FOOLS WHO MAGNIFY THEMSELVES OVER THE WISE.</p>  
 <p>The time when foxes shall turn into lions hath not yet been recorded,<br> 55 Nor when slaves shall have obtained dominion over their lords.</p>  
 <p align="center">OF THE DEATH OF JESUS CHRIST ON OUR BEHALF.</p>  
 <p>O turtle-dove, I am struck with wonder at thee,. for I marvel at thee,<br> For though thou hast ornaments on thy neck, yet hast<br> thou pitch in thy hands, and weeping in thy mouth.<br> If thou art a bride why have thy wailings disturbed the woods?<br> 60 And if thou art a mourner wherein do thine ornaments benefit thy body?<br> The dove replieth, "The love of my spouse hangeth upon my neck like a jewelled ornament,<br> "And my hands are dyed with his precious blood as it were with a pledge.<br> "And, behold, I suffer henceforth through what he suffered for me,<br> "Even as I take pride in and am glad because of his resurrection."</p>  
 <p align="center">65 THE DISSOLUTION OF THE WORLD.</p>  
 <p>A certain wise man likened the world to the globe of the sun,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_191"><font size="1" color="green">p. 191</font></a></p>  
 <p>Which in turning in the hands of children indicateth the end;<br> It leapeth from one to another and passeth on without stopping.<br> And it indicateth to us that temporal glory is a dream.<br> The new moon sheweth the vanishing of the time of 70 my life,<br> And I take pride therein, and my mind, rejoiceth in the sight thereof.<br> She is born, she waxeth, she waneth, she dieth away, and finally disappeareth,<br> And every man occupieth himself with vain things and feareth not.<br> For the lamb is bound beneath the knife whilst its fellow leapeth,<br> And men are greatly moved by things which are to 75 be greatly desired whilst death spoileth.</p>  
 <p align="center">ANOTHER.</p>  
 <p>O young man, thou lover of the world, let not this [present] enjoyment flatter thee,<br> For the name of this world is derived from labour <a name="fr_125"></a><a href="#fn_125"><font size="1">1</font></a>, yea, even from vexation.</p>  
 <p align="center">OF THE CRAFTY MAN, AND OF THE MOCKER, AND OF THE BOASTER.</p>  
 <p>The man who is wicked, and is crafty, and is a boaster, 80<br> Continually pryeth into the lapses of his neighbour.<br> And rather than gaze upon virtues he closeth the eye,<br> And, like the fly, never seeketh anything but a sore.</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_192"><font size="1" color="green">p. 192</font></a></p>  
 <p align="center">OF THE AVARICIOUS MAN.</p>  
 <p>85 The man who is sluggish and altogether lazy in [doing] good<br> Leaveth behind not any to pollute the wall.<br> That the miser may heap up money he will even wear sandals of iron,<br> For never by any means whatsoever doth he improve in virtue.<br> He is a fountain from which man draweth not water. 90<br> And even though such a fountain were the spring of Siloam it would be meet for it to be shut up.<br> When such a fountain is choked man complaineth not,<br> And when its waters are cut off every man rejoiceth, and leaveth it, and is at peace.</p>  
 <p align="center">ANOTHER.</p>  
 <p>The perverse prince of a people should <a href="errata.htm#2">first</a> of all correct himself,<br> 95 And then his people; otherwise his labour will be in vain.<br> For the crooked shadow cannot be straight<br> Except the wood from which it cometh be also straight.</p>  
 <p align="center">ON THE DEATH OF A BELOVED ONE.</p>  
 <p>O our brother, at thy death I am stricken with amazement, I am afflicted and am utterly undone, 100<br> And what I shall say of both matters I know not.<br> For either in thy death have I eaten of the second death,<br> Or death in thy death hath swallowed me up like a dragon.<br> O our little brother, among the brethren thou wert splendid and glorious,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_193"><font size="1" color="green">p. 193</font></a></p>  
 <p>Even as thou wert splendid and glorious among the stars of clay.<br> Thou didst dissipate all afflictions and sorrows, 105<br> Even as the rays of the sun scatter the darkness at noonday.<br> Against sufferings we had a buckler and armour,<br> And by thy converse every disagreeable thing was driven away.</p>  
 <p align="center">ANOTHER.</p>  
 <p>The Lord, Who hath wrought great and mighty deeds 110 on earth,<br> And hath made the dead to live and hath given strength to the feeble,<br> Will give thee, O my brother, happiness with the angelic hosts,<br> And will sprinkle thee with the dew of mercy and of glorious things<br> And the spirits of the righteous will be friends and brethren of thine.</p>  
 <p align="center">ANOTHER. 115</p>  
 <p align="center">ON THE DEATH OF THE PATRIARCH JOHN BAR-MA‘DANÎ <a name="fr_126"></a><a href="#fn_126"><font size="1">1</font></a>,</p>  
 <p align="center">BY GREGORY BAR-HEBRÆUS.</p>  
 <p>O Angel of Death, why hast thou smitten me with such sorrow as this,<br> And hast pitilessly rewarded me with such evil as this?<br> The sun of time, the luminary, the prop of the Church,<br> The head of the soul, the soul of the spirit, the right 120 spirit,</p>  
 <p>
 </p>  
 <p><a name="page_194"><font size="1" color="green">p. 194</font></a></p>  
 <p>The fruit of the heart, the life of life, the light of the pupil of the eye,<br> The holy of holies, the pure in feelings, the new spirit,<br> Hast thou taken away from us; and our lament is one of mourning.<br> Thou hast cast our crown to earth, thou hast overturned our exalted horn.<br> 125 Under thy protection it became springtime for us throughout the year,<br> And even winter took upon itself the attribute of summer.<br> In the time of December as in the time of January<br> We possessed a rose without any hateful thing and grapes on the vine.<br> No man among us ever drew nigh to the fig-tree<br> 130 Without seeing it to be full of fruit, yea, richly dowered therewith.<br> [Our] garden was like unto the Garden of Eden,<br> And, behold, without our father, it is like unto the bottommost hell.<br> O father of truth, let all life perish except thy life,<br> And if I forget thee, let this my beloved right hand forget me.<br> 135 Through thy removal, behold, the Church hath become filled with grief,<br> And through the want of the perfection which belongeth<br> to thee it hath become a defective thing.<br> That which belonged to thyself alone hath become a strange form,<br> And to thee alone hath come the manhood of our Lord.<br> Tell me, O our father, where thy blessed habitation is,<br> 140 And how the eye which hath become infirm can see thee.<br> Though there fall to me the fiercest path of fire,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_195"><font size="1" color="green">p. 195</font></a></p>  
 <p>Yet I will travel on the top thereof, even though it blaze with flame.<br> The pure soul which was in thy body hath become perfect,<br> And it hath straightway become mingled with the phalanxes of the Watchers and of the spiritually wise;<br> Above the fiery coals among the wheels [hast thou] set 145 thy footstep.<br> If thou couldst permit me to see the divine Shechinah,<br> The eye of the soul which though now it were bashful,<br> Yet at the sight of thy shadow would it become luminous.<br> This despised form [of mine] would be unworthy to see thee,<br> Therefore hath thy Lord made for thee a house in the 150 heavens.<br> In all the world my soul hath become a wretched and apostate thing,<br> And thyself alone in all the world wast its friend.<br> Why didst thou leave it in despair and solitude?<br> Why didst thou not take it with thee as a handmaiden or as a servant?<br> Since it never at any time spared itself in [thy] service, 155<br> Why didst thou leave it in tears behind thee like a rejected thing?<br> From the time when it came into being it never heard the voice of weeping,<br> But through thy departure it hath become skilled in the arts of grief.<br> What one who mourneth for a lover or for a mistress,<br> Payeth heed to the voice of him that draweth nigh 160 with speech of consolation?<br> Though thinking to give comfort to others like the tragedian,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_196"><font size="1" color="green">p. 196</font></a></p>  
 <p>Its own habitation is far removed from consolation.<br> in the dreams of the night when [my] rational soul is empty,<br> It becometh painted with shapes of vanity in thy form, 165<br> For thou knowest that that which was sweet hath become most bitter.<br> And what ill luck hath come upon the soul that was thine handmaiden, O mistress!<br> From the time when became certain to thee the intention of departure<br> It became empty and destitute of both knowledge and understanding.<br> In the treasury of the mind blazing fire hath been piled up, 170<br> Which overcometh with fierce flame and burning the Babylonish woman.<br> With the dew of life of thine angelic shadow<br> Unless thou sprinkle her behold she will be burnt up like the Chaldean woman.<br> Her liver hath become to her a well—like the Israelitish woman—<br> And in it is preserved the unquenchable fire of thy love.<br> 175 In two mighty fire-temples it hath become a dweller,<br> And within a very little it had worshipped the fire like a Persian.<br> In the heart and liver, which are the houses of life, the fire kindleth,<br> And into them entereth the Magian prophetess to prophesy.<br> Inasmuch as her body is enfeebled and her mind wandereth,<br> 180 If she erreth in her speech let her not be blamed.<br> My heart hath no peace and quietness, and my mind getteth no rest,</p>  
 <p><a name="page_197"><font size="1" color="green">p. 197</font></a></p>  
 <p>And without thy likeness there will never remain perception in my brain.<br> [My] sleep by day and by night is washed with tears,<br> And for this reason a sleepless eye hath come to me.<br> If an unwatchful eye hath ever been seen, <a name="fr_127"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">*</font></a> 185<br> It would fix itself to see thee; and if [it] did not no man would see it sunk in slumber. <a name="fr_128"></a><a href="#fn_127"><font size="1">*</font></a><br> For at thy gate [my] soul standeth like a beggar,<br> Asking a vision of thyself in a dream and not a cake.</p>
