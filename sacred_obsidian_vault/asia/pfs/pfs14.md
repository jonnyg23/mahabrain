 <p></p><dir>Have you heard of the terrible Tic-balan,<br> A tall and thin and very black man,<br> With terrible teeth and a horse's head,<br> And covered with hair that is long and red?  
 <p>He lives in the awful Balete tree,<br> And to pass the place you must say "Tabi";<br> If you do not, the Asuang comes at night,<br> And throws big stones till you die of fright.</p>  
 <p>Now once there lived in Santa Cruz town<br> A little girl known as Juanita Calaon;<br> She was gentle and sweet and as good as could be,<br> And she always bowed low to the Balete tree.</p>  
 <p>One day to the forest alone she did roam<br> To get some good wood for the fire at home;<br> She gathered some twigs that she found on the ground,<br> And all of them fast in a bundle she bound.</p>  
 <p>Then happy and free, with the pack on her head,<br> She followed the road that back to town led.<br> She sang as she walked, and so happy was she<br> That alas! she bowed not to the Balete tree.</p>  
 <p>All at once then she heard a most terrible roar,<br> And the Tic-balan fierce through the air seemed to soar.<br> He seized poor Juanita, and quick as could be<br> He shut her inside of the Balete tree.</p>  
 <p>Two days passed, and when the girl failed to come back,<br> Her parents went out, and no friends did they lack<br> To help in the search, for the whole pueblo came,<br> And loudly they shouted poor Juanita's name.</p>  
 <p>At last when they thought that the search brought no good,<br> One man found Juanita's neat bundle of wood;<br> He called the good news, and as more came to see,<br> Loud knocking was heard in the Balete tree.</p>  
 <p>Then many were frightened, but many were brave,<br> And wondered by what means the girl they could save;<br> For they knew that it must be Juanita who knocked,<br> And that inside the Balete tree she was locked.</p>  
 <p>Soon they ordered that candles and music be brought,<br> And a crucifix holy was what they next sought;<br> And when all was ready they closed round the tree,<br> While they prayed to the true God to set the girl free.</p>  
 <p>They lighted the candles and then the band played,<br> And Juanita's mother, who was not afraid,<br> Advanced with the crucifix held in her hand,<br> And tapped with the cross on the evil tree grand.</p>  
 <p>Then a roar shook the forest and chilled all their hearts,<br> And the awful Balete split into two parts;<br> Then they saw in the center, as each big half fell,<br> Their darling Juanita all smiling and well.</p>  
 <p>She ran from the tree to her fond mother dear,<br> While the band played and every one gave a loud cheer;<br> Then back to the pueblo they danced in delight,<br> And kept up their singing through all the long night.</p>  
 <p>Still there to this day lies the Balete tree,<br> But no more do the people that pass say "Tabi."<br> And the spirit no more can molest any man,<br> For God has more power than the fierce Tic-balan.</p></dir>
