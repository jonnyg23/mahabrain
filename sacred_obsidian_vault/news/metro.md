 <h1 align="CENTER">Sacred Sleuth </h1>   
 <p>Learning about alchemy, Zoroastrianism and   even sacred sexuality got a little bit harder last month when a student at   the Freie Universität in   Berlin hacked into the Santa Cruz-based Sacred-texts.com </p>   
 <p>Site administrator <b>John Bruno   Hare</b> says a German hacker,   purportedly a Christian fundamentalist, nearly brought down the site, which   is one of the largest on the web on the topic of religion and carries a wide   spectrum of religious texts in an effort to promote religious tolerance. </p>   
 <p>Determined to keep the site open, <b>Hare</b> sleuthed out the hacker, one   Robert Mücke, who apparently used a machine in his   university's physics department to conduct a series of denial of service   attacks (which means a program is used to download the pages at a website   repeatedly, thereby overloading the web server and preventing other users   from accessing the site) against the sacred-texts archive for a 10-day period   in March. Mücke reportedly downloaded the site   twice a day, with attacks peaking mid-March, when he downloaded it five times   over. </p>   
 <p><b>Hare</b> says he first became aware something was wrong when   sales of the Sacred-texts CD-ROM dropped dead. </p>   
 <p>"I had just shipped a new version of   the CD, which had drawn a lot of interest, and I was mystified as to why it   wasn't selling," says <b>Hare</b>,   noting that customers leave if response time is slow, which is what denial of   service does. </p>   
 <p>Concerned, <b>Hare</b>   examined the site logs and found a massive number of hits arriving from a   machine named "broiler.physik.fu-berlin.de."   </p>   
 <p>Recognizing this address to mean the Freie Universitaet of Berlin, <b>Hare</b> contacted system administrators   who promptly barred the hacker. </p>   
 <p>So, why did Mücke   muck with <b>Hare's</b> sacred site? </p>   
 <p>An email (reproduced verbatim below) Mücke sent to <b>Hare</b>   on being closed down may shed some light. </p>   
 <p>"I surely can not agree with to mix up   all the pagan cults, idols, witchcrafts (6. &amp; 7. book of   "Moses"), esoteric, ocullt, theosophic and even satanic views and the God that   created heaven and earth that hates these former things with one another   without distinction. I am probably not the first who tells you this, but also   not the last. God will be last one for sure. There would be no martyrs Fox   could have been writing about, and no <b>John</b>   Bunyan suffering persecution and writing such precious allegories about the   way and fight of believers towards Heaven, if these people of former   generations had such relativistic view of truth that comes more and more   common today, that calls evil good and good evil." </p>   
 <p><b>Hare</b> says the site usually gets a positive response. </p>   
 <p>"I get emails from people of all   faiths saying that it's a valuable resource. Two days after Sept. 11, we saw   a big spike in use, with up to a million hits a day, with people mostly   referencing Nostradamus after receiving an email,   saying the terrorist attacks were part of his predictions--a claim our site   helped show to be an urban legend." </p>   
 <p>Noting that Buddhism, Taoism and Sacred   Sexuality usually get the most hits, <b>Hare</b>   says the purpose of the site is to promote religious tolerance. </p>   
 <p>"Unfortunately, there are also a lot   of people who don't like the idea of religious tolerance and are willing to   go to any extreme to quash it. Fundamentalism is beyond my comprehension and   everybody is welcome at the website, but when someone starts denying others   access, I have to draw the line. I'm just glad the whole episode is   over." </p>   
 <p>Us, too. Come to think of it, <b>Hare</b> probably has the only functioning   dotcom left in town. </p>   <div align="center">      </div>
