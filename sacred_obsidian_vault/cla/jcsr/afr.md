 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="afr_1">1</a></font></span>Caesar, advancing by moderate journeys, and  continuing his march without intermission, arrived at Lilybaeum, on the  14th day before the calends of January. Designing to embark immediately,  though he had only one legion of new levies, and not quite six hundred  horse, he ordered his tent to be pitched so near the sea-side that the waves  lashed the very foot of it. This he did with a view that none should think he  had time to delay, and that his men might be kept in readiness at a day or an  hour's warning. Though the wind at that time was contrary, he nevertheless  detained the soldiers and mariners on board, that he might lose no  opportunity of sailing; the rather, because the forces of the enemy were  announced by the inhabitants of the province, to consist of innumberable  cavalry not to be numbered; four legions headed by Juba, together with a  great body of light-armed troops; ten legions under the command of Scipio;  a hundred and twenty elephants, and fleets in abundance. Yet he was not  alarmed, nor lost his confident hopes and spirits. Meantime the number of  galleys and transports increased daily; the new-levied legions flocked in to  him from all parts; among the rest the fifth, a veteran legion, and about two  thousand horse.

 Caesar itineribus iustis confectis nullo die intermisso a. d. XIIII Kal. Ian. Lilybaeum pervenit statimque ostendit sese naves velle conscendere, cum non amplius legionem tironum haberet unam, equites vix DC.  Tabernaculum secundum litus ipsum constituit, ut prope fluctus verberaret.  Hoc eo consilio fecit nequis sibi morae quicquam fore speraret et ut omnes in dies horasque parati essent.  Incidit per id tempus ut tempestates ad navigandum idoneas non haberet.  Nihilo tamen minus in navibus remiges militesque continere et nullam praetermittere occasionem profectionis, cum praesertim ab incolis eius provinciae nuntiarentur adversariorum copiae: equitatus infinitus, legiones regiae IIII, levis armaturae magna vis, Scipionis legiones X, elephanti CXX classesque esse complures.  Tamen non deterrebatur animoque et spe confidebat.  Interim in dies et naves longae adaugeri et onerariae complures eodem concurrere et legiones tironum convenire IIII, veterana legio quinta, equitum ad II milia.

Then sending the greatest part of  the fleet before, with orders to sail for the island of Aponiana, not far from  Lilybaeum; he himself continued a little longer in Sicily, and exposed to  public sale some confiscated estates. Leaving all other affairs to the care of  Allienus the praetor, who then commanded in the island; and strictly  charging him to use the utmost expedition in embarking the remainder of  the troops; he set sail the sixth day before the calends of January, and soon  came up with the rest of the fleet. As the wind was favorable, and afforded a  quick passage, he arrived the fourth day within sight of Africa, attended by a  few galleys: for the transports, being mostly dispersed and scattered by the  winds, with the exception of a few were driven different ways. Passing  Clupea and Neapolis with the fleet, he continued for some time to coast  along the shore, leaving many towns and castles behind him.

Piso  appeared upon the shore toward Clupea, with the cavalry of Adrumetum,  and about three thousand Moors, he stopped awhile, facing the port, till the  rest of the fleet should come up, and then landed his men, though their  number at that time did not exceed three thousand foot and a hundred and  fifty horse. There, encamping before the town, he continued quiet, without  offering any act of hostility, and restrained all from plunder. Meantime the  inhabitants manned the walls, and assembled in great numbers before the  gate, to defend themselves, their garrison within amounting to two legions.  Caesar, having ridden round the town, and thoroughly examined its  situation, returned to his camp. Some blamed his conduct on this occasion,  and charged him with a considerable oversight, in not appointing a place of  meeting to the pilots and captains of the fleet, or delivering them sealed  instructions, according to his usual custom; which being opened at a certain  time, might have directed them to assemble at a specified place. But in this  Caesar acted not without design; for as he knew of no port in Africa that  was clear of the enemy's forces, and where the fleet might rendezvous in  security, he chose to rely entirely upon fortune, and land where occasion  offered.

Caesar circum oppidum vectus natura loci perspecta rediit in castra.  Non nemo culpae eius imprudentiaeque adsignabat quod neque circum loca gubernatoribus praefectisque quid peterent praeceperat, neque ut more ipsius consuetudo superioribus temporibus fuerat, tabellas signatas dederat, ut in tempore his perlectis locum certum peterent universi.  Quod minime Caesarem fefellerat; namque nullum portum terrae Africae quo classes decurrerent, pro certo tutum ab hostium praesidio fore suspicabatur, sed fortuitu oblatam occasionem egressus aucupabatur.

Plancus, one of Caesar's  lieutenants, desired leave to treat with Considius, and try, if possible, to  bring him to reason. Leave being granted accordingly, he wrote him a letter,  and sent it into the town by a captive. When the captive arrived, and  presented the letter, Considius, before he received it, demanded whence it  came, and being told from Caesar, the Roman general, answered, "That he  knew no general of the Roman forces but Scipio." Then, commending the  messenger to be immediately slain in his presence, he delivered the letter,  unread and unopened, to a trusty partisan, with orders to carry it directly to  Scipio.

This being perceived, the  legionaries immediately halted; and the cavalry, though few in number,  boldly charged the vast multitude of the enemy. An incredible event  occurred, that less than thirty Gallic horse repulsed two thousand Moors,  and drove them into the town. Having thus repulsed the enemy and  compelled them to retire behind their walls, Caesar resumed his intended  march: but observing that they often repeated their sallies, renewing the  pursuit from time to time, and again fleeing when attacked by the horse, he  posted a few of the veteran cohorts which he had with him, with part of the  cavalry, in the rear, and so proceeded slowly on his march. The further he  advanced from the town, the less eager were the Numidians to pursue.  Meantime, deputies arrived from the several towns and castles on the road,  offering to furnish him with corn, and to perform whatever he might  command. Toward the evening of that day, which was the calends of  January, he fixed his camp at Ruspina.

Here he was met by deputies from  the town, who, in the name of the inhabitants, offered their free submission.  Whereupon, placing centurions and a guard before the gates, to prevent the  soldiers from entering, or offering violence to any of the inhabitants, he  himself encamped toward the shore, not far distant from the town. Hither by  accident arrived some of the galleys and transports; by whom he was  informed that the rest of the fleet, uncertain what course to pursue, had been  steering for Utica. In the mean time Caesar could not depart from the sea,  nor seek the inland provinces, on account of the error committed by the  fleet. He likewise sent the cavalry back to their ships, probably to hinder the  country from being plundered, and ordered fresh water to be carried to them  on board. Meanwhile the Moorish horse rose suddenly, Caesar's party not  expecting it, on the rowers who had been employed in carrying water, as  they came out of the ships, and wounded many with their darts and killed  some. For the manner of these barbarians is, to lie in ambush with their  horses among the valleys, and suddenly launch upon an enemy; they seldom  choosing to engage hand to hand in a plain.

At the same  time he ordered out ten galleys, to get intelligence of the transports that had  missed their way, and to maintain the freedom of the sea. He also ordered C.  Sallustius Prispus, the praetor, at the head of a squadron, to sail to Percina,  then in the hands of the enemy, because he heard there was great quantity of  corn in that island: he gave these orders and instructions in such a manner as  to leave no room for excuse or delay. Meanwhile, having informed himself,  from the deserters and natives, of the condition of Scipio and his followers;  and understanding that they were at the whole charge of maintaining Juba's  cavalry; he could not but pity the infatuation of men, who thus chose to be  tributaries to the king of Numidia, rather than securely enjoy their fortunes  at home with their fellow-citizens.

Here he deposited the baggage of the army; and  marching out with a light body of troops to forage, ordered the inhabitants  to follow with their horses and carriages. Having by this means got together  a great quantity of corn, he came back to Ruspina. I think that he acted with  this intention, that by keeping possession of the maritime cities, and  providing them with garrisons, he might secure a retreat for his fleet.

His  departure occasioned the utmost sadness and consternation among the  troops; for being few in number, mostly new levies, and those not all  suffered to land, they saw themselves exposed, upon a foreign coast, to the  mighty forces of a crafty nation, supported by an innumerable cavalry. Nor  had they any resource in their present circumstances, or expectation of  safety in their own conduct; but derived all their hope from the alacrity,  vigor, and wonderful cheerfulness that appeared in their general's  countenance; for he was of an intrepid spirit, and behaved with undaunted  resolution and confidence. On his conduct, therefore, they entirely relied,  and hoped to a man, that by his skill and talents, all difficulties would  vanish before them.

Wherefore, ordering his men to quit their ships immediately, and  receive the rest of the troops in arms upon the shore, he made the new fleet  enter the port with the utmost diligence; and landing all the forces, horse  and foot, returned again to Ruspina. Here he established his camp; and  taking with him thirty cohorts, without baggage, advanced into the country  to forage. Thus was Caesar's purpose at length discovered: that he meant,  unknown to the enemy, to have sailed to the assistance of the transports that  had missed their way, lest they should unexpectedly fall in with the African  fleet. And he did not wish his own soldiers who were left behind in garrison  to know this, lest they should be intimidated by the smallness of their  numbers, and the multitude of the enemy.

As soon as this  announcement was made, a great cloud of dust began to appear. Upon this  intelligence, Caesar ordered all his horse, of which he had at that time but a  very small number, to advance, as likewise his archers, only a few of whom  had followed him from the camp; and the legions to march quietly after him  in order of battle; while he went forward at the head of a small party.

Caesar  drew up his army in a single line, being obliged to do so by the smallness of  his numbers; covering his front with his archers, and placing his cavalry on  the right and left wings, with particular instructions not to suffer themselves  to be surrounded by the enemy's numerous horse; for he imagined that he  would have to fight only with infantry.

The latter could scarcely keep  their ground against their numbers. Meanwhile, both the main bodies  advancing to engage, the enemy's cavalry, intermixed with some  light-armed Numidians, suddenly sprang forward, from their crowded  troops, and attacked the legions with a shower of darts.

Meanwhile, Labienus's cavalry, confiding in their numbers  endeavored to surround those of Caesar: who being few in number, and  overpowered by the multitude of the enemy, were forced to give ground a  little, their horses being much wounded.

Has he infatuated you too with his words?  Truly he has brought you into a fine condition! I pity you sincerely." Upon  this, one of the soldiers said: "I am none of your raw warriors, Labienus, but  a veteran of the tenth legion." " Where's your standard?" replied Labienus. "  I'll soon make you sensible who I am," answered the soldier. Then pulling  off his helmet, to discover himself, he threw a javelin, with all his strength  at Labienus, which wounding his horse severely in the breast-"Know,  Labienus," says he, "that this dart was thrown by a soldier of the tenth  legion." However, the whole army was not a little daunted, especially the  new levies; and began to cast their eyes upon Caesar, minding nothing, for  the present, but to defend themselves from the enemy's darts.

By this  means, he broke the enemy's circle with his right and left wings; and  attacking one part of them, thus separated from the other, with his horse and  foot, at last put them to flight. He pursued them but a little way, fearing an  ambuscade, and returned again to his own men. The same was done by the  other division of Caesar's horse and foot, so that the enemy being driven  back, and severely wounded on all sides, he retreated toward his camp, in  order of battle.

Piso, with  eleven hundred select Numidian horse, and a considerable body of foot,  arrived to the assistance of the enemy; who, recovering from their terror,  upon this reinforcement, and again resuming courage, fell upon the rear of  the legions, as they retreated, and endeavored to hinder them from reaching  their camp. Caesar, perceiving this, ordered his men to wheel about, and  renew the battle in the middle of the plain. As the enemy still pursued their  former plan, and avoided a closing engagement, and the horses of Caesar's  cavalry had not yet recovered the fatigue of their late voyage, and were  besides weakened with thirst, weariness, wounds, and of course unfit for a  vigorous and long pursuit, which even the time of the day would not allow,  he ordered both horse and foot to fall at once briskly upon the enemy, and  not slacken the pursuit till they had driven them quite beyond the furthest  hills, and taken possession of them themselves. Accordingly, upon a signal  being given, when the enemy were throwing their javelins in a faint and  careless manner, he suddenly charged them with his horse and foot; who in  a moment driving them from the field, and over the adjoining hill, kept  possession of that post for some time, and then retired slowly, in order of  battle, to their camp. The enemy, who, in this last attack, had been very  roughly handled, then at length retreated to their fortifications.

From them we  learned that it was the design of the enemy to have astonished our raw  troops, with their new and uncommon manner of fighting; and after  surrounding them with their cavalry, to have cut them to pieces, as they had  done Curio; and that they had marched against us expressly with that  intention. Labienus had even said, in the council of war, that he would lead  such a numerous body of auxiliaries against his adversaries, as should  fatigue us with the very slaughter, and defeat us even in the bosom of  victory; for he relied more on the number than the valor of his troops. He  had heard of the mutiny of the veteran legions at Rome, and their refusal to  go into Africa; and was likewise well assured of the fidelity of his troops,  who had served three years under him in Africa. He had a great number of  Numidian cavalry and light-armed troops, besides the Gallic and German  horse, whom he had drawn together out of the remains of Pompey's army,  and carried over with him from Brundusium: he had likewise the freed men  raised in the country, and trained to use bridled horses; and also the  immense number of Juba's forces, his hundred and twenty elephants, his  innumerable cavalry and legionaries, amounting to above twelve thousand.  Emboldened by the hope such mighty forces raised in him, on the day  before the nones of January, three days after Caesar's arrival, he came  against him, with sixteen hundred Gallic and German horse, nine hundred  under Petreius, eight thousand Numidians, four times that number of  light-armed foot, with a multitude of archers and slingers. The battle lasted  from the fifth hour till sunset, during which time Petreius, receiving a  dangerous wound, was obliged to quit the field.

He  landed a great number darts and military engines, armed part of the  mariners, Gauls, Rhodians, and others, that after the example of the enemy  he might have a number of light-armed troops to intermix with his cavalry.  He likewise strengthened his army with a great number of Syrian and  Iturean archers whom he drew from the fleet into his camp: for he  understood that within three days Scipio was expected to unite his forces to  Labienus and Petreius, and his army was said to consist of eight legions and  three thousand horse. At the same time he established workshops, made a  great number of darts and arrows, provided himself with leaden bullets and  palisades, wrote to Sicily for hurdles and wood to make rams, because he  had none in Africa, and likewise gave orders for sending corn; for the  harvest in that country was like to be inconsiderable, the enemy having  taken all the laborers into their service the year before, and stored up the  grain in a few fortified towns, after demolishing the rest, forcing the  inhabitants into the garrisoned places, and exhausting the whole country.

He also recovered Sicily, Africa, Numidia,  Mauritania, with amazing dispatch, and by that means gained an illustrious  and extensive reputation among all nations, and triumphed while very young  and only a Roman knight. Nor did he enter upon the administration of  public affairs, distinguished by the shining exploits of his father, or the fame  and reputation of his ancestors, or the honors and dignities of the state. Will  you, on the contrary, possessed of these honors, and the reputation acquired  by your father, sufficiently distinguished by your own industry and greatness  of mind, not bestir yourself, join your father's friends, and give the earnestly  required assistance to yourself, the republic, and every man of worth?"

Their cavalry made  continual excursions to our very works, and intercepted those who ventured  too far in quest of wood or water, and obliged us to keep within our  intrenchments. This soon occasioned a great scarcity of provision among  Caesar's men, because no supplies had yet arrived from Sicily and Sardinia.  The season, too, was dangerous for navigation, and he did not possess above  six miles in each direction, in Africa, and was moreover greatly distressed  for want of forage. The veteran soldiers and cavalry, who had been engaged  in many wars both by sea and land, and often struggled with wants and  misfortunes of this kind, gathering sea-weed, and washing it in fresh water,  by that means subsisted their horses and cattle.

Accordingly he left his kingdom, at the head of a large body of horse and  foot, and marched to join his allies. Meantime P.

They had offered the  inhabitants leave to depart in safety, if they would peaceably deliver up the  town; but these conditions being rejected, they were taken by storm, and the  citizens all put to the sword. They continued to advance, and incessantly  harassed the cities and country; of which Juba having intelligence, though  he was upon the point of joining Scipio and the other chiefs, determined that  it was better to march to the relief of his own kingdom, than run the hazard  of being driven from it while he was assisting others, and, perhaps, after all,  miscarry too in his designs against Caesar.

He immediately dispatched letters into Sicily, to Allienus and  Rabirius Posthumus the praetors [to tell them] that without delay or excuse,  either of the winter or the winds, they must send over the rest of the troops,  to save Africa from utter ruin; because, without some speedy remedy, not a  single house would be left standing, nor any thing escape the fury and  ravages of the enemy. And he himself was so anxious and impatient, that  from the day the letters were sent, he complained without ceasing of the  delay of the fleet, and had his eyes night and day turned toward the sea. Nor  was it wonderful; for he saw the villages burned, the country laid waste, the  cattle destroyed, the towns plundered, the principal citizens either slain or  put in chains, and their children dragged into servitude under the name of  hostages; nor could he, amid all this scene of misery, afford any relief to  those who implored his protection, on account of the small number of his  forces.

Messala, Caesar's lieutenant, at  Messana, and made use of very seditious language; nay, had even seized the  money and ornaments destined for Caesar's triumph, and for that reason  dreaded his resentment. He, conscious of his demerits, persuaded the young  men to surrender themselves to Virgilius, by whom they were sent under a  strong guard to Scipio, and three days after put to death. It is said, that the  elder Titius begged of the centurions who were charged with the execution,  that he might be first put to death; which being easily granted, they both  suffered according to their sentence.

Sometimes too the  German and Gallic cavalry of Labienus entered into discourse with those of  Caesar, after promising not to injure one another. Meantime Labienus, with  a party of horse, endeavored to surprise the town of Leptis, which Saserna  guarded with three cohorts; but was easily repulsed, because the town was  strongly fortified, and well provided with warlike engines; he however  renewed the attempt several times. One day, as a strong squadron of the  enemy had posted themselves before the gate, their officer being slain by an  arrow discharged from a cross-bow, and pinned to his own shield, the rest  were terrified and took to flight; by which means the town was delivered  from any further attempts.

He ordered the rest of the  cavalry to be ready and armed, each in his own place. These orders were not  given by himself in person, or after viewing the disposition of the enemy  from the rampart; but such was his consummate knowledge of the art of  war, that he gave all the necessary directions by his officers, he himself  sitting in his tent, and informing himself of the motions of the enemy by his  scouts. He very well knew, that, whatever confidence the enemy might have  in their numbers, they would yet never dare to attack the camp of a general  who had so often repulsed, terrified, and put them to flight; who had  frequently pardoned and granted them their lives; and whose very name had  weight and authority enough to intimidate their army. He was besides well  intrenched with a high rampart and deep ditch, the approaches to which  were rendered so difficult by the sharp spikes which he had disposed in a  very skillful manner, that they were even sufficient of themselves to keep  off the enemy. He had also a large supply of cross-bows, engines, and all  sorts of weapons necessary for a vigorous defense, which he had prepared  on account of the fewness of his troops, and the inexperience of his new  levies. It was not owing to being influenced by the fear of the enemy or their  numerical strength, that he allowed himself to appear daunted in their  estimation. And it was not owing to his having any doubts of gaining the  victory that he did not lead his troops to action, although they were raw and  few, but he thought that it was a matter of great importance, what sort the  victory should be: for he thought that it would disgrace him, if after so many  noble exploits, and defeating such powerful armies, and after gaining so  many glorious victories, he should appear to have gained a bloody victory  over the remnants who had rallied after their flight. He determined, in  consequence of this, to endure the pride and exultation of his enemies, until  some portion of his veteran legion should arrive in the second embarkation.

Upon intelligence of this, Considius Longus,  who was at Adrumetum with two legions and seven hundred horse, leaving  a garrison in that city, hastened to Acilla at the head of eight cohorts: but  Messius, having accomplished his march with great expedition, arrived  there before him.

Sallustius  meanwhile was well received by the Cercinates, and finding great store of  corn in the island, loaded all the ships then in the port, whose number was  very considerable, and dispatched them to Caesar's camp. At the same time  Allienus, the proconsul, put on board of the transports at Lilybaeum the  thirteenth and fourteenth legions, with eight hundred Gallic horse and a  thousand archers and slingers, and sent the second embarkation to Africa, to  Caesar. This fleet meeting with a favorable wind, arrived in four days at  Ruspina, where Caesar had his camp. Thus he experienced a double  pleasure on this occasion, receiving at one and the same time, both a supply  of provisions and a reinforcement of troops, which animated the soldiers,  and delivered them from the apprehensions of want. Having landed the  legions and cavalry, he allowed them some time to recover from the fatigue  and sickness of their voyage, and then distributed them into the forts, and  along the works.

When they were brought before him, they  begged they might have leave to speak without personal danger, which  being granted, "It is now a long time, great general," said they, "since many  of us Getulians, clients of C. Marius, and almost all Roman citizens of the  fourth and sixth legions, have wished for an opportunity to come over to  you; but have hitherto been prevented by the guards of Numidian horse,  from doing it without great risk. Now we gladly embrace the occasion,  being sent by Scipio under the name of deserters, to discover what ditches  and traps you have prepared for his elephants, how you intended to oppose  these animals, and what dispositions you are making for battle." They were  praised by Caesar, and liberally rewarded, and sent to the other deserters.  We had soon a proof of the truth of what they had advanced; for the next  day a great many soldiers of these legions, mentioned by the Getulians,  deserted to Caesar's camp.

Scipio, discouraged by so  unexpected a check, and the number of his wounded and slain, kept within  his lines. Caesar, with his army in battle array, marched along the roots of  the hills, and gradually approached his trenches. Caesar's legions were, by  this time, not more than a mile from Uzita, a town possessed by Scipio,  when the latter, fearing lest he should lose the town, whence he procured  water and other conveniences for his army, resolved therefore to preserve it,  at all hazards, and brought forth his whole army, and drew them up in four  lines, forming the first of cavalry, supported by elephants with castles on  their backs. Caesar believing that Scipio approached with the intention of  giving battle, continued where he was posted, not far from the town. Scipio  meanwhile, having the town in the center of his front, extended his two  wings, where were his elephants, in full view of our army.

 His rebus gestis Caesar postero die ex omnibus praesidiis cohortes eduxit atque omnes suas copias in campo instruxit. Scipio suis male acceptis occisis convulneratisque intra suas continere se munitiones coepit. Caesar instructa acie secundum infimas iugi radices propius munitiones leniter accessit.  Iamque minus mille passus ab oppido Uzitta quod Scipio tenebat aberant legiones Iulianae, cum Scipio veritus ne oppidum amitteret, unde aquari reliquisque rebus sublevari eius exercitus consuerat, eductis omnibus copiis quadruplici acie instructa, ex instituto suo prima equestri turmatim derecta elephantisque turritis interpositis armatisque, suppetias ire contendit.

Having therefore led back his troops  to their camp, he resolved next day to extend his lines nearer the town.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="afr_47">47</a></font></span>About this time a most incredible accident  befell Caesar's army; for the Pleiades being set, about the second watch of  the night, a terrible storm arose, attended by hail of an uncommon size. But  what contributed to render this misfortune the greater was, that Caesar had  not, like other generals, put his troops into winter quarters, but was every  three or four days changing his camp, to gain ground on the enemy; which  keeping the soldiers continually employed they were utterly unprovided  with any conveniences to protect them from the inclemency of the weather.  Besides, he had brought over his army from Sicily with such strictness, that  neither officer nor soldier had been permitted to take their equipages or  utensils with them, nor so much as a vessel or a single slave; and so far had  they been from acquiring or providing themselves with any thing in Africa,  that, on account of the great scarcity of provisions, they had even consumed  their former stores. Impoverished by these accidents, very few of them had  tents; the rest had made themselves a kind of covering, either by spreading  their clothes, or with mats and rushes. But these being soon penetrated by  the storm and hail, the soldiers had no resource left, but wandered up and  down the camp, covering their heads with their bucklers to shelter them  from the violence of the weather. In a short time the whole camp was under  water, the fires extinguished, and all their provisions washed away or  spoiled. The same night the shafts of the javelins belonging to the fifth  legion, of their own accord, took fire.

When he arrived he lodged himself, with those forces  which I have described, in a separate camp, at no great distance from that of  Scipio. (Great alarm had prevailed for some time previously in Caesar's  camp, and the report of his approach had increased and produced a general  suspense and expectation among the troops. But his arrival, and the  appearance of his camp, soon dispelled all these apprehensions; and they  despised the king of Mauritania, now that he was present, as much as they  had feared him when at a distance.) After this junction, any one might easily  perceive that Scipio's courage and confidence were increased by the arrival  of the king. For next day, drawing out all his own and the royal forces, with  sixty elephants, he ranged them, in order of battle, with great ostentation  advancing a little beyond his intrenchments, and, after a short stay, retreated  to his camp.

Labienus, perceiving that Caesar must march this way, and  having a perfect knowledge of the country, placed himself in ambush, with  the light-armed foot and part of the cavalry. At the same time he disposed  some horse behind the hills, that when he should fall unexpectedly upon  Caesar's foot, they might suddenly advance from behind the mountain. And  thus Caesar and his army being attacked in front and rear, surrounded with  danger on all sides, and unable either to retreat or advance, would, he  imagined, fall an easy prey to his victorious troops. Caesar, who had no  suspicion of the ambuscade, sent his cavalry before; and arriving at the  place, Labienus's men, either forgetting or neglecting the orders of their  general, or fearing to be trampled to death in the ditch by our cavalry, began  to issue in small parties from the rock, and ascend the hill. Caesar's horse  pursuing them, slew some, and took others prisoners; then making toward  the hill drove thence Labienus's detachment and immediately took  possession.

He then ordered two lines of communication to be drawn from the  greater camp, across the plain on the side of Uzita, which stood between  him and the enemy, and was garrisoned by a detachment of Scipio's army,  and place them in such a manner as to meet at the right and left angles of the  town. His design in this work was, that when he approached the town with  his troops, and began to attack it, these lines might secure his flanks, and  hinder the enemy's horse from surrounding him, and compelling him to  abandon the siege. It likewise gave his men more frequent opportunities of  conversing with the enemy, and facilitated the means of desertion to such as  favored his cause; many of whom had already come over, though not  without great danger to themselves. He wanted also, by drawing nearer the  enemy, to see if they really intended to come to an action, and in addition to  all these reasons, that the place itself being very low, he might there sink  some wells; whereas before he had a long and troublesome way to send for  water. While the legions were employed in these works, part of the army  stood ready drawn up before the trenches, and had frequent skirmishes with  the Numidian horse and light-armed foot

But the event was very  different from what the enemy expected; for Caesar, leading back his  legions to the assistance of his cavalry, they immediately rallied, turned  upon the Numidians, and charging them vigorously while they were  dispersed and disordered with the pursuit, drove them with great loss to the  king's camp, and slew several of them.

Avienus, a  military tribune of the tenth legion, who, when he set out for Sicily, filled a  ship entirely with his own slaves and horses, without taking on board one  single soldier. Wherefore, summoning all the military tribunes and  centurions to appear before his tribunal next day, he addressed them in these  terms, "I could have wished that those, whose insolence and former  licentious character have given me cause of complaint, had been capable of  amendment, and of making a good use of my mildness, patience, and  moderation. But since they know not how to confine themselves within due  bounds, I intend to make an example of them, according to the law of arms,  in order that others may be taught a better conduct. Because you, C.  Avienus, when you were in Italy, instigated the soldiers of the Roman  people to revolt from the republic and have been guilty of rapines and  plunders in the municipal towns; and because you have never been of any  real service, either to the commonwealth or to your general, and in lieu of  soldiers, have crowded the transports with your slaves and equipage; so that,  through your fault, the republic is in want of soldiers, who at this time are  not only useful, but necessary; for all these causes, I break you with  ignominy, and order you to leave Africa this very day. In like manner I  break you, A. Fonteius, because you have behaved yourself as a seditious  officer, and as a bad citizen. You, T. Salienus, M. Tiro, C. Clusinus, have  attained the rank of centurions through my indulgence, and not through your  own merit; and since you have been invested with that rank, have neither  shown bravery in war, nor good conduct in peace, and have been more  zealous in raising seditions, and exciting the soldiers against your general  than in observing forbearance and moderation. I therefore think you  unworthy of continuing centurions in my army: I break you, and order you  to quit Africa as soon as possible." Having concluded this speech, he  delivered them over to some centurions, with orders to confine them  separately on board a ship, allowing each of them a single slave to wait on  him.

Juba, having thus three wars to sustain, was compelled to  detach six cohorts from the army destined to act against Caesar, and send  them to defend the frontiers of his kingdom against the Getulians.

He caused warlike engines in great  numbers to be placed in the front of his works, wherewith he played  perpetually against the town; and to increase the enemy's apprehensions,  drew five legions out of his other camp. When this opportunity was  presented, several persons of eminence and distinction earnestly requested  an interview with their friends, and held frequent conferences, which Caesar  foresaw would turn to his advantage. For the chief officers of the Getulian  horse, with other illustrious men of that nation (whose fathers had served  under C. Marius, and from his bounty obtained considerable estates in their  country, but after Sylla's victory had been made tributaries to king  Hiempsal), taking advantage of the night, when the fires were lighted, came  over to Caesar's camp near Uzita, with their horses and servants, to the  number of about a thousand.

Aquinius in discourse with C. Saserna. Scipio sent him word that  he did not do well to correspond with the enemy. Aquinius, however, paid  no attention to this reprimand, but pursued his discourse. Soon after, one of  Juba's guards came to him and told him, in the hearing of Saserna, "The  king forbids you to continue this conversation." He, being terrified by this  order, immediately retired, and obeyed the command of the king. One can  not wonder enough at this step in a Roman citizen, who had already attained  to considerable honors in the commonwealth; that though neither banished  his country, nor stripped of his possessions, he should pay a more ready  obedience to the orders of a foreign prince than those of Scipio; and choose  rather to behold the destruction of his party than return into the bosom of his  country. And still greater insolence was shown by Juba, not to M. Aquinius,  a man of no family, and an inconsiderable senator, but even to Scipio  himself, a man of illustrious birth, distinguished honors, and high dignity in  the state. For as Scipio, before the king's arrival, always wore a purple coat  of mail, Juba is reported to have told him, that he ought not to wear the  same habit as he did. Accordingly, Scipio changed his purple robe for a  white one, submitting to Juba, a most haughty and insolent monarch.

Caesar likewise drew out his men, and  disposed them in battle array before his lines; not doubting but the enemy,  who exceeded him in number of troops, and had been so considerably  reinforced by the arrival of king Juba, would advance to attack him.  Wherefore, having ridden through the ranks, encouraged his men, and gave  them the signal of battle, he stayed, expecting the enemy's charge. For he  did not think it advisable to remove far from his lines: because the enemy  having a strong garrison in Uzita, which was opposite to his right wing, he  could not advance beyond that place without exposing his flank to a sally  from the town. He was also deterred by the following reason, because the  ground before Scipio's army was very rough, and he thought it likely to  disorder his men in the charge.

Scipio drew up his troops in the following  manner: he posted his own legions and those of Juba in the front; behind  them the Numidians, as a body of reserve: but in so very thin ranks, and so  far extended in length, that to see them at a distance you would have taken  the main body for a simple line of legionaries, which was doubled only  upon the wings. He placed elephants at equal distances on the right and left,  and supported them by the light-armed troops and auxiliary Numidians. All  the regular cavalry were on the right; for the left was covered by the town of  Uzita, nor had the cavalry room to extend themselves on that side.  Accordingly, he stationed the Numidian horse, with an incredible multitude  of light-armed foot, about a thousand paces from his right, toward the foot  of a mountain, considerably removed from his own and the enemy's troops.  He did so with this intention, that, when the two armies should engage, his  cavalry at the commencement of the action should take a longer sweep,  inclose Caesar's army and throw them into confusion by their darts. Such  was Scipio's disposition.

Elephantos dextro sinistroque cornu collocaverat aequalibus inter eos intervallis interiectis, post autem elephantos armaturas leves Numidasque auxiliares substituerat.  Equitatum frenatum universum in  suo dextro cornu disposuerat: sinistrum enim cornu oppido Uzitta claudebatur, neque erat spatium equitatus explicandi.  Praeterea Numidas levisque armaturae infinitam multitudinem ad dextram partem suae aciei opposuerat fere interiecto non minus mille passum spatio et ad collis radices magis adpulerat longiusque ab adversariorum suisque copiis promovebat, id hoc consilio ut cum acies duae inter se concurrissent, initio certaminis paulo longius eius equitatus circumvectus ex improviso clauderet multitudine sua exercitum Caesaris atque perturbatum iaculis configeret.

His second line on the right consisted partly of the cohorts of those legions  we have already mentioned, partly of the new levies. His third line was  posted to the left, extending as far as the middle legion of the main body,  and so disposed, that the left wing formed a triple order of battle. The reason  of this disposition was, because his right wing being defended by the works,  it behooved him to make his left stronger, that they might be a match for the  numerous cavalry of the enemy; for which reason he had placed all his horse  there, intermixed with light-armed foot; and as he could not rely much upon  them, had detached the fifth legion to sustain them. He placed archers up  and down the field, but principally in the two wings.

But when Caesar began to  retreat within his lines, suddenly all the Numidian and Getulian horse  without bridles, who were posted behind the enemy's army, made a motion  to the right, and began to approach Caesar's camp on the mountain; while  the regular cavalry under Labienus continued in their post to keep our  legions in check. Upon this, part of Caesar's cavalry, with the light-armed  foot, advancing hastily, and without orders, against the Getulians, and  venturing to pass the morass, found themselves unable to deal with the  superior multitude of the enemy; and being abandoned by the light-armed  troops, were forced to retreat in great disorder, after the loss of one trooper,  twenty-six light-armed foot, and many of their horses wounded. Scipio,  overjoyed at this success, returned toward night to his camp. But fortune  determined not to give such unalloyed joy to those engaged in war, for the  day after, a party of horse, sent by Caesar to Leptis in quest of provisions,  falling in unexpectedly with some Numidian and Getulian stragglers, killed  or made prisoners about a hundred of them. Caesar, meanwhile, omitted not  every day to draw out his men and labor at the works; carrying a ditch and  rampart quite across the plain, to prevent the incursions of the enemy.  Scipio likewise drew lines opposite to Caesar's, and used great exertions lest  Caesar should cut off his communication with the mountain. Thus both  generals were busied about their intrenchments, yet a day seldom passed,  without some skirmish between the cavalry.

Caesar, ignorant of his arrival, sent L. Cispius, with a  squadron of twenty-seven sail toward Thapsus, to anchor there for the  security of his convoys; and likewise dispatched Q. Aquila to Adrumetum,  with thirteen galleys, upon the same errand. Cispius soon reached the station  appointed to him: but Aquila being attacked by a storm could not double the  cape, which obliged him to put into a creek at some distance, that afforded  convenient shelter.

Scipio had sent two legions thither to forage;  which Caesar having intelligence of from a deserter, removed his camp  from the plain to a hill, for the greater security; and leaving a garrison there,  marched at three in the morning with the rest of his forces, passed the  enemy's camp, and possessed himself of the town. He found that Scipio's  legions were gone further into the country to forage: against whom, setting  out immediately, he found that the whole army had come up to their  assistance, which obliged him to give over the pursuit. He took, on this  occasion, C. Mutius Reginus, a Roman knight, Scipio's intimate friend, and  governor of the town; also P. Atrius, a Roman knight, of the province of  Utica, with twenty-two camels, belonging to king Juba. Then leaving a  garrison in the place, under the command of Oppius, his lieutenant, he  returned to his own camp.

When Caesar perceived this, he detached his cavalry  to receive their charge, ordered the legions to throw all their baggage into a  heap, and face about upon the enemy. No sooner was this order executed  than, upon the first charge of the legions, the enemy's horse and light-armed  foot began to give way, and were with incredible ease driven from the  higher ground. But when Caesar, supposing them sufficiently deterred from  any further attempts, began to pursue his march, they again issued from the  hills; and the Numidians, with the light armed infantry, who are wonderfully  nimble, and accustom themselves to fight intermixed with the horse, with  whom they keep an equal pace, either in advancing or retiring, fell a second  time upon our foot. As they repeated this often, pressing upon our troops  when we marched, and retiring when we endeavored to engage, always  keeping at a certain distance, and with singular care avoiding a close fight,  and considering it enough to wound us with their darts, Caesar plainly saw  that their whole aim was to oblige him to encamp in that place, where no  water was to be had; that his soldiers, who had tasted nothing from three in  the morning till four in the afternoon, might perish with hunger, and the  cattle with thirst.

Proceeding thus with a slow and gentle pace,  he found the legions fitter to sustain the enemy's charge. Meantime the  Numidian horse, wheeling round the hills, to the right and left, threatened to  inclose Caesar's forces with their numbers, while part continued to harass  his rear: and if but three or four veteran soldiers faced about, and darted  their javelins at the enemy, no less than two thousand of them would tale to  flight: but suddenly rallying, returned to the fight, and charged the  legionaries with their darts. Thus Caesar, at one time marching forward, at  another halting, and going on but slowly, reached the camp safe, about  seven that evening, having only ten men wounded. Labienus too retreated to  his camp, after having thoroughly fatigued his troops with the pursuit: in  which, besides a great number wounded, his loss amounted to about three  hundred men. And Scipio withdrew his legions and elephants, whom, for  the greater terror, he had ranged before his camp within view of Caesar's  army.

For the  enemy's light-armed troops gave wonderful trouble and annoyance to our  army; because they not only deterred the cavalry from the encounter, by  killing their horses with their javelins, but likewise wearied out the  legionary soldiers by their swiftness: for as often as these heavy-armed  troops advanced to attack them, they evaded the danger by a quick retreat.

In addition to this, the number and size of the elephants  greatly increased the terror of the soldiers; for which, however, he found a  remedy, in causing some of those animals to be brought over from Italy, that  his men might be accustomed to the sight of them, know their strength and  courage, and in what part of the body they were most vulnerable. For as the  elephants are covered with trappings and ornaments, it was necessary to  inform them what parts of the body remained naked, that they might direct  their darts thither. It was likewise needful to familiarize his horses to the  cry, smell, and figure of these animals; in all of which he succeeded to a  wonder; for the soldiers quickly came to touch them with their hands, and to  be sensible of their tardiness; and the cavalry attacked them with blunted  darts, and, by degrees, brought their horses to endure their presence.

Nor  ought we to wonder; for in Gaul he had under him troops accustomed to  fight in a champaign country, against an open undesigning enemy, who  despised artifice, and valued themselves only on their bravery. But now he  was to habituate his soldiers to the arts and contrivances of a crafty enemy,  and teach them what to pursue, and what to avoid. The sooner therefore to  instruct them in these matters, he took care not to confine his legions to one  place, but under pretense of foraging, engaged them in frequent marches,  and counter-marches; because he thought that the enemy's troops would not  lose his track. Three days after, he drew up his forces with great skill, and  marching past Scipio's camp, waited for him in an open plain; but seeing  that he still declined a battle, he retreated to his camp a little before evening.

However, this circumstance had not escaped Caesar's attention, for he had  ordered three hundred men out of each legion to hold themselves in  readiness for action.

Upon sight of this disposition, he drew up his army  in three lines, placed the tenth and second legions on the right wing, the  eighth and ninth on the left, five legions in the center, covered his flanks  with five cohorts, posted opposite the elephants, disposed the archers and  slingers in the two wings, and intermingled the light-armed troops with his  cavalry. He himself on foot went from rank to rank, to rouse the courage of  the veterans, putting them in mind of their former victories, and animating  them by his kind expressions. He exhorted the new levies who had never yet  been in battle to emulate the bravery of the veterans, and endeavor by a  victory to attain the same degree of fame, glory, and renown.

As many others in the army began to observe this, his  lieutenants and volunteers begged him to give the signal for battle, as the  immortal gods promised him a decisive victory. While he hesitated and  strove to repress their eagerness and desires, exclaiming that it was not his  wish to commence the battle by a sudden sally, at the same time keeping  back his army, on a sudden a trumpeter in the right wing, without Caesar's  leave, but compelled by the soldiers, sounded a charge. Upon this all the  cohorts began to rush toward the enemy, in spite of the endeavors of the  centurions, who strove to restrain them by force, lest they should charge  withal the general's order, but to no purpose.

On the right wing the archers and  slingers poured their eager javelins without intermission upon the elephants,  and by the noise of their slings and stones, so terrified these animals, that  turning upon their own men, they trod them down in heaps, and rushed  through the half-finished gates of the camp. At the same time the  Mauritanian horse, who were in the same wing with the elephants, seeing  themselves deprived of their assistance, betook themselves to flight.  Whereupon the legions wheeling round the elephants, soon possessed  themselves of the enemy's intrenchments, and some few that made great  resistance being slain, the rest fled with all expedition to the camp they had  quitted the day before.

But the servants and attendants of the  camp, attacking them with darts and stones, obliged them to return to the  town. Scipio's forces meanwhile being beaten, and his men fleeing on all  sides, the legions instantly began the pursuit, that they might have no time to  rally. When they arrived at the camp to which they fled, and where, having  repaired it, they hoped to defend themselves they began to think of choosing  a commander, to whose, authority and orders they might submit; but finding  none on whom they could rely, they threw down their arms, and fled to the  king's quarter. Finding this, on their arrival, occupied by Caesar's forces,  they retired to a hill, where, despairing of safety, they cast down their arms,  and saluted them in a military manner. But this stood them in little stead, for  the veterans, transported with rage and anger, not only could not be induced  to spare the enemy, but even killed or wounded several citizens of  distinction in their own army, whom they upbraided as authors of the war.  Of this number was Tullius Rufus the quaestor, whom a soldier designedly  ran through with a javelin; and Pompeius Rufus, who was wounded with a  sword in the arm, and would doubtless have been slain, had he not speedily  fled to Caesar for protection. This made several Roman knights and senators  retire from the battle, lest the soldiers, who after so signal a victory assumed  an unbounded license, should be induced by the hopes of impunity to wreck  their fury on them likewise. In short all Scipio's soldiers, though they  implored the protection of Caesar, were in the very sight of that general, and  in spite of his entreaties to his men to spare them, without exception put to  the sword.

In his way he appeared before the town of Thapsus, and  ranged all the elephants he had taken in the battle, amounting to sixty-four,  with their ornaments, trappings, and castles, in full view of the place. This  he did in hopes that possibly Virgilius and those that were besieged with  him might give over the idea of resistance on learning the defeat of their  friends.

Thence they marched directly to Utica. M. Cato, some time before,  distrusting the inhabitants of that city, on account of the privileges granted  them by the Julian law, had disarmed and expelled the populace, obliging  them to dwell without the Warlike gate, in a small camp surrounded by a  slight intrenchment, around which he had planted guards, while at the same  time he put the senators under arrest. The cavalry attacked their camp,  knowing them to be favorers of Caesar, and intending to wipe out by their  destruction, the disgrace of their own defeat. But the people, animated by  Caesar's victory, repulsed them with stones and clubs. They therefore threw  themselves into the town, killed many of the inhabitants, and pillaged their  houses. Cato, unable to prevail with them to abstain from rapine and  slaughter, and undertake the defense of the town, as he was not ignorant of  what they aimed at, gave each a hundred sesterces to make them quiet. Sylla  Faustus did the same out of his own money; and marching with them from  Utica, advanced into the kingdom.

These Cato assembled, with three hundred more  who had furnished Scipio with money for carrying on the war, and exhorted  them to set their slaves free, and in conjunction with them defend the town.  But finding that though part assembled, the rest were terrified and  determined to flee, he gave over the attempt, and furnished them with ships  to facilitate their escape. He himself, having settled all his affairs with the  utmost care, and commended his children to L. Caesar his quaestor, without  the least indication which might give cause of suspicion, or any change in  his countenance and behavior, privately carried a sword into his chamber  when he retired to rest, and stabbed himself with it. When the wound not  proving mortal, he fell heavily to the ground, his physician and friends  suspecting what was going on, burst into the room and began to stanch and  bind up his wound, he himself most resolutely tore it open, and met death  with the greatest determination. The Uticans, though they hated his party,  yet in consideration of his singular integrity, his behavior so different from  that of the other chiefs, and because he had strengthened their town with  wonderful fortifications, and increased the towers, interred him honorably.  L. Caesar, that he might procure some advantage by his death, assembled  the people, and after haranguing them, exhorted them to open their gates,  and throw themselves upon Caesar's clemency, from which they had the  greatest reason to hope the best. This advice being followed, he came forth  to meet Caesar. Messala having reached Utica, according to his orders,  placed guards at the gates.

Quem Gaetuli sui comites in itinere praedae cupidi concidunt seque in quascumque potuere partes conferunt. C.  Interim Vergilius postquam terra marique clausus se nihil proficere intellexit suosque interfectos aut fugatos, M. Catonem Uticae sibi ipsum manus attulisse, regem vagum ab suisque desertum ab omnibus aspernari, Saburram eiusque copias ab Sittio esse deletas, Uticae Caesarem sine mora receptum, de tanto exercitu reliquias esse nullas, ipse sibi suisque liberis a C. Caninio proconsule qui eum obsidebat, fide accepta seque et sua omnia et oppidum proconsuli tradit.

Juba, as being the stronger,  easily got the better of his adversary, and laid him dead at his feet: but  endeavoring afterward to run himself through the body, and wanting  strength to accomplish it, he was obliged to have recourse to one of his  slaves, and, by entreaties, prevailed upon him to put him to death.

 Rex interim ab omnibus civitatibus exclusus desperata salute, cum iam cenatus esset, cum Petreio, ut cum virtute interfecti esse viderentur, ferro inter se depugnant, atque firmior imbecilliorem Iubam Petreius facile ferro consumpsit. Deinde ipse sibi cum conaretur gladio traicere pectus nec posset, precibus a servo suo impetravit ut se interficeret, idque obtinuit.

Sitius, having defeated the  army of Sabura, Juba's lieutenant, and slain the general, and marching with a  few troops through Mauritania, to join Caesar, chanced to fall in with  Faustus and Afranius, who were at the head of the party that had plundered  Utica, amounting in all to about fifteen hundred men, and designing to make  the best of their way to Spain. Having expeditiously placed himself in  ambuscade during the night, and attacking them by day-break, he either  killed or made them all prisoners, except a few that escaped from the van.  Afranius and Faustus were taken among the rest, with their wives and  children: but some few days after, a mutiny arising among the soldiers,  Faustus and Afranius were slain. Caesar pardoned Pompeia, the wife of  Faustus, with her children, and permitted her the free enjoyment of all her  effects.

 P.

Itaque celeriter nocturno tempore insidiis dispositis eos prima luce adortus praeter paucos equites qui ex primo agmine fugerant, reliquos aut interfecit aut in deditionem accepit, Afranium et Faustum cum coniuge et liberis vivos capit.  Paucis post diebus dissensione in exercitu orta Faustus et Afranius interficiuntur; Pompeiae cum Fausti liberis Caesar incolumitatem suaque omnia concessit.

Sitius chanced at that time  to be. Scipio's vessels, which were but small, and few in number, were  easily surrounded and sunk, by the larger and more numerous ships of  Sitius; on which occasion Scipio, and all those whom we have mentioned  above, as having embarked with him, perished.

There he sold the estates  of the officers who had served under Juba and Petreius, fined the people of  Thapsus twenty thousand sesterces, and the company of Roman merchants  there thirty thousand; he likewise fined the inhabitants of Adrumetum in  thirty thousand, and their company fifty thousand; but preserved the cities  and their territories from insult and plunder. Those of Leptis, whom Juba  had pillaged some time before, and who, upon complaint made to the senate  by their deputies, had obtained arbitrators and restitution, were enjoined to  pay yearly three hundred thousand pounds of oil; because from the  beginning of the war, in consequence of a dissension among their chiefs,  they had made an alliance with the king of Numidia, and supplied him with  arms, soldiers, and money. The people of Tisdra, on account of their  extreme poverty, were only condemned to pay annually a certain quantity of  corn.

Here he condemned the Sulcitani in a fine of one hundred thousand  sesterces, for receiving and aiding Nasidius's fleet; and instead of a tenth  which was their former assessment, ordered them now to pay an eighth to  the public treasury. He likewise confiscated the estates of some who had  been more active than the rest, and weighing from Carales on the third day  before the calends of July, coasted along the shore, and after a voyage of  twenty-eight days, during which he was several times obliged by contrary  winds to put into port, arrived safe at Rome.
