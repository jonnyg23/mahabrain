 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_3_1">3:1</a></font></span>Julius Caesar, holding the election as dictator,  was himself appointed consul with Publius Servilius; for this was the year in  which it was permitted by the laws that he should be chosen consul. This  business being ended, as credit was beginning to fail in Italy, and the debts  could not be paid, he determined that arbitrators should be appointed: and  that they should make an estimate of the possessions and properties [of the  debtors], how much they were worth before the war, and that they should be  handed over in payment to the creditors. This he thought the most likely  method to remove and abate the apprehension of an abolition of debt, the  usual consequence of civil wars and dissensions, and to support the credit of  the debtors. He likewise restored to their former condition (the praetors and  tribunes, first submitting the question to the people) some persons  condemned for bribery at the elections, by virtue of Pompey's law, at the  time when Pompey kept his legions quartered in the city (these trials were  finished in a single day, one judge hearing the merits, and another  pronouncing the sentences), because they had offered their service to him in  the beginning of the civil war, if he chose to accept them; setting the same  value on them as if he had accepted them, because they had put themselves  in his power. For he had determined that they ought to be restored rather by  the judgment of the people than appear admitted to it by his bounty: that he  might neither appear ungrateful in repaying an obligation, nor arrogant in  depriving the people of their prerogative of exercising this bounty.

 Dictatore habente comitia Caesare consules creantur Iulius Caesar et P. Servilius: is enim erat annus, quo per leges ei consulem fieri liceret. His rebus confectis, cum fides tota Italia esset angustior neque creditae pecuniae solverentur, constituit, ut arbitri darentur; per eos fierent aestimationes possessionum et rerum, quanti quaeque earum ante bellum fuisset, atque hac creditoribus traderentur. Hoc et ad timorem novarum tabularum tollendum minuendumve, qui fere bella et civiles dissensiones sequi consuevit, et ad debitorum tuendam existimationem esse aptissimum existimavit. Itemque praetoribus tribunisque plebis rogationes ad populum ferentibus nonnullos ambitus Pompeia lege damnatos illis temporibus, quibus in urbe praesidia legionum Pompeius habuerat, quae iudicia aliis audientibus iudicibus, aliis sententiam ferentibus singulis diebus erant perfecta, in integrum restituit, qui se illi initio civilis belli obtulerant, si sua opera in bello uti vellet, proinde aestimans, ac si usus esset, quoniam aui fecissent potestatem. Statuerat enim prius hos iudicio populi debere restitui, quam suo beneficio videri receptos, ne aut ingratus in referenda gratia aut arrogans in praeripiendo populi beneficio videretur.

But he scarcely found as many ships as would be sufficient to  transport fifteen thousand legionary soldiers and five hundred horse. This  [the scarcity of shipping] was the only thing that prevented Caesar from  putting a speedy conclusion to the war. And even these troops embarked  very short of their number, because several had fallen in so many wars in  Gaul, and the long march from Spain had lessened their number very much,  and a severe autumn in Apulia and the district about Brundusium, after the  very wholesome countries of Spain and Gaul, had impaired the health of the  whole army.

He  had exacted a large sum of money from Asia, Syria, and all the kings,  dynasts, tetrarchs, and free states of Achaia; and had obliged the  corporations of those provinces, of which he himself had the government, to  count down to him a large sum.

Besides, he had distributed among his  legions a considerable number, by way of recruits, from Thessaly, Boeotia,  Achaia, and Epirus: with his legions he also intermixed the soldiers taken  from Caius Antonius. Besides these, he expected two legions from Syria,  with Scipio; from Crete, Lacedaemon, Pontus, Syria, and other states, he got  about three thousand archers, six cohorts of slingers, two thousand  mercenary soldiers, and seven thousand horse; six hundred of which,  Deiotarus had brought from Gaul; Ariobarzanes, five hundred from  Cappadocia. Cotus had given him about the same number from Thrace, and  had sent his son Sadalis with them. From Macedonia there were two  hundred, of extraordinary valor, commanded by Rascipolis; five hundred  Gauls and Germans; Gabinius's troops from Alexandria, whom Aulus  Gabinius had left with king Ptolemy, to guard his person. Pompey, the son,  had brought in his fleet eight hundred, whom he had raised among his own  and his shepherds' slaves. Tarcundarius, Castor and Donilaus, had given  three hundred from Gallograecia: one of these came himself, the other sent  his son. Two hundred were sent from Syria by Comagenus Antiochus,  whom Pompey rewarded amply. The most of them were archers. To these  were added Dardanians and Bessians, some of them mercenaries; others  procured by power and influence: also, Macedonians, Thessalians, and  troops from other nations and states, which completed the number which we  mentioned before.

He had resolved  to fix his winter quarters at Dyrrachium, Apollonia, and the other seaports,  to hinder Caesar from passing the sea: and for this purpose had stationed his  fleet along the sea-coast. The Egyptian fleet was commanded by Pompey,  the son: the Asiatic, by Decimus Laelius, and Caius Triarius: the Syrian, by  Caius Cassius: the Rhodian, by Caius Marcellus, in conjunction with Caius  Coponius: and the Liburnian and Achaian, by Scribonius Libo, and Marcus  Octavius.

They cried out with one voice, "he  might give what orders he pleased, that they would cheerfully fulfill them."  He accordingly set sail the fourth day of January, with seven legions on  board, as already remarked. The next day he reached land, between the  Ceraunian rocks and other dangerous places; meeting with a safe road for  his shipping to ride in, and dreading all other ports which he imagined were  in possession of the enemy, he landed his men at a place called Pharsalus,  without the loss of a single vessel.

But they had not the confidence to dare to move out of the  harbor; though Caesar had brought only twelve ships as a convoy, only four  of which had decks; nor did Bibulus, his fleet being disordered and his  seamen dispersed, come up in time: for Caesar was seen at the continent,  before any account whatsoever of his approach had reached those regions.

The charge of this business was committed to lieutenant Fufius  Kalenus, with orders to be expeditious in transporting the legions. But the  ships having put to sea too late, and not having taken advantage of the night  breeze, fell a sacrifice on their return. For Bibulus at Corcyra, being  informed of Caesar's approach, hoped to fall in with some part of our ships,  with their cargoes, but found them empty; and having taken about thirty,  vented on them his rage at his own remissness, and set them all on fire: and,  with the same flames, he destroyed the mariners and masters of the vessels,  hoping by the severity of the punishment to deter the rest. Having  accomplished this affair, he filled all the harbors and shores from Salona to  Oricum with his fleets. Having disposed his guard with great care, he lay on  board himself in the depth of winter, declining no fatigue or duty, and not  waiting for reinforcements, in hopes that he might come within Caesar's  reach.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_3_9">3:9</a></font></span>But after the departure Of the Liburnian fleet,  Marcus Octavius sailed from Illyricum with what ships he had to Salona,  and having spirited up the Dalmatians, and other barbarous nations, he drew  Issa off from its connection with Caesar; but not being able to prevail with  the council of Salona, either by promises or menaces, he resolved to storm  the town. But it was well fortified by its natural situation and a hill. The  Roman citizens built wooden towers, the better to secure it; but when they  were unable to resist, on account of the smallness of their numbers, being  weakened by several wounds, they stooped to the last resource, and set at  liberty all the slaves old enough to bear arms; and cutting the hair off the  women's heads, made ropes for their engines. Octavius, being informed of  their determination, surrounded the town with five encampments, and began  to press them at once with a siege and storm. They were determined to  endure every hardship, and their greatest distress was the want of corn.  They, therefore, sent deputies to Caesar, and begged a supply from him; all  other inconveniences they bore by their own resources, as well as they  could: and after a long interval, when the length of the siege had made  Octavius's troops more remiss than usual, having got an opportunity at  noon, when the enemy were dispersed, they disposed their wives and  children on the walls, to keep up the appearance of their usual attention; and  forming themselves into one body, with the slaves whom they had lately  enfranchised, they made an attack on Octavius's nearest camp, and having  forced that, attacked the second with the same fury; and then the third and  the fourth, and then the other, and beat them from them all: and having  killed a great number, obliged the rest and Octavius himself to fly for refuge  to their ships. This put an end to the blockade. Winter was now  approaching, and Octavius, despairing of capturing the town, after  sustaining such considerable losses, withdrew to Pompey, to Dyrrachium.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_3_10">3:10</a></font></span>We have mentioned, that Vibullius Rufus, an  officer of Pompey's had fallen twice into Caesar's power; first at Corfinium,  and afterward in Spain. Caesar thought him a proper person, on account of  his favors conferred on him, to send with proposals to Pompey: and he knew  that he had an influence over Pompey. This was the substance of his  proposals: "That it was the duty of both, to put an end to their obstinacy, and  forbear hostilities, and not tempt fortune any further; that sufficient loss had  been suffered on both sides, to serve as a lesson and instruction to them, to  render them apprehensive of future calamities, by Pompey, in having been  driven out of Italy, and having lost Sicily, Cardinia, and the two Spains, and  one hundred and thirty cohorts of Roman citizens, in Italy and Spain: by  himself, in the death of Curio, and the loss of so great an army in Africa,  and the surrender of his soldiers in Corcyra. Wherefore, they should have  pity on themselves, and the republic: for, from their own misfortunes, they  had sufficient experience of what fortune can effect in war. That this was  the only time to treat for peace; when each had confidence in his own  strength, and both seemed on an equal footing. Since, if fortune showed  ever so little favor to either, he who thought himself superior, would not  submit to terms of accommodation; nor would be content with an equal  division, when he might expect to obtain the whole. That as they could not  agree before, the terms of peace ought to be submitted to the senate and  people in Rome. That in the mean time, it ought to content the republic and  themselves, if they both immediately took oath in a public assembly that  they would disband their forces within the three following days. That having  divested themselves of the arms and auxiliaries, on which they placed their  present confidence, they must both of necessity acquiesce in the decision of  the people and senate. To give Pompey the fuller assurance of his intentions,  he would dismiss all his forces on the land, even his garrisons.

Pompey was at this time in Candavia, and was on  his march from Macedonia to his winter quarters in Apollonia and  Dyrrachium; but surprised at the unexpected news, he determined to go to  Apollonia by speedy marches, to prevent Caesar from becoming master of  all the maritime states. But as soon as Caesar had landed his troops, he set  off the same day for Oricum: when he arrived there, Lucius Torquatus, who  was governor of the town by Pompey's appointment, and had a garrison of  Parthinians in it, endeavored to shut the gates and defend the town, and  ordered the Greeks to man the walls, and to take arms. But as they refused  to fight against the power of the Roman people, and as the citizens made a  spontaneous attempt to admit Caesar, despairing of any assistance, he threw  open the gates, and surrendered himself and the town to Caesar, and was  preserved safe from injury by him.

As soon as  it was said that Caesar was approaching, such a panic fell upon Pompey's  army, because in his haste he had made no distinction between night and  day, and had marched without intermission, that they almost every man  deserted their colors in Epirus and the neighboring countries; several threw  down their arms, and their march had the appearance of a flight. But when  Pompey had halted near Dyrrachium, and had given orders for measuring  out the ground for his camp, his army even yet continuing in their fright,  Labienus first stepped forward and swore that he would never desert him,  and would share whatever fate fortune should assign to him. The other  lieutenants took the same oath, and the tribunes and centurions followed  their example: and the whole army swore in like manner. Caesar, finding the  road to Dyrrachium already in the possession of Pompey, was in no great  haste, but encamped by the river Apsus, in the territory of Apollonia, that  the states which had deserved his support might be certain of protection  from his out-guards and forts; and there he resolved to wait the arrival of his  other legions from Italy, and to winter in tents. Pompey did the same; and  pitching his camp on the other side of the river Apsus, collected there all his  troops and auxiliaries.

Sed cum prope Dyrrachium Pompeius constitisset castraque metari iussisset, perterrito etiam tum exercitu princeps Labienus procedit iuratque se eum non deserturum eundemque casum subiturum, quemcumque ei fortuna tribuisset. Hoc idem reliqui iurant legati; tribuni militum centurionesque sequuntur, atque idem omnis exercitus iurat.

And he was not allowed to get either wood or water, or  even anchor near the land. He was reduced to great difficulties, and  distressed with extreme scarcity of every necessary; insomuch that he was  obliged to bring, in transports from Corcyra, not only provisions, but even  wood and water; and it once happened that, meeting with violent storms,  they were forced to catch the dew by night which fell on the hides that  covered their decks; yet all these difficulties they bore patiently and without  repining, and thought they ought not to leave the shores and harbors free  from blockade. But when they were suffering under the distress which I  have mentioned, and Libo had joined Bibulus, they both called from on  ship-board, to Marcus Acilius and Statius Marcus, the lieutenants, one of  whom commanded the town, the other the guards on the coast, that they  wished to speak to Caesar on affairs of importance, if permission should be  granted them. They add something further to strengthen the impression that  they intended to treat about an accommodation. In the mean time they  requested a truce, and obtained it from them; for what they proposed seemed  to be of importance, and it was well known that Caesar desired it above all  things, and it was imagined that some advantage would be derived from  Bibulus's proposals.

When he arrived, they were invited to a conference. Libo came and  made an apology for Bibulus, "that he was a man of strong passion, and had  a private quarrel against Caesar, contracted when he was aedile and praetor;  that for this reason he had avoided the conference, lest affairs of the utmost  importance and advantage might be impeded by the warmth of his temper.

But when they  were acquainted with Caesar's demands, they would transmit them to  Pompey, who would conclude all of himself by their persuasions.

But Caesar  required "that he should be allowed to send commissioners to Pompey, who  should suffer no personal injury; and that either they should grant it, or  should take his commissioners in charge, and convey them to Pompey. That  as to the truce, the war in its present state was so divided, that they by their  fleet deprived him of his shipping and auxiliaries; while he prevented them  from the use of the land and fresh water; and if they wished that this  restraint should be removed from them, they should relinquish their  blockade of the seas, but if they retained the one, he in like manner would  retain the other; that nevertheless, the treaty of accommodation might still  be carried on, though these points were not conceded, and that they need not  be an impediment to it." They would neither receive Caesar's  commissioners, nor guarantee their safety, but referred the whole to  Pompey. They urged and struggled eagerly to gain the one point respecting a  truce.

On his death, the sole command devolved on no  single individual, but each admiral managed his own division separately,  and at his own discretion. Vibullius, as soon as the alarm, which Caesar's  unexpected arrival had raised, was over, began again to deliver Caesar's  message in the presence of Libo, Lucius Lucceius, and Theophanes, to  whom Pompey used to communicate his most confidential secrets. He had  scarcely entered on the subject when Pompey interrupted him, and forbade  him to proceed. "What need," says he, "have I of life or Rome, if the world  shall think I enjoy them by the bounty of Caesar: an opinion which can  never be removed while it shall be thought that I have been brought back by  him to Italy, from which I set out."

Caesar sent Publius Vatinius, one of his  lieutenants, to the bank of the river, to make such proposals as should  appear most conducive to peace; and to cry out frequently with a loud voice  [asking], "Are citizens permitted to send deputies to citizens to treat of  peace? a concession which had been made even to fugitives on the Pyrenean  mountains, and to robbers, especially when by so doing they would prevent  citizens from fighting against citizens." Having spoken much in humble  language, as became a man pleading for his own and the general safety and  being listened to with silence by the soldiers of both armies, he received an  answer from the enemy's party that Aulus Varro proposed coming the next  day to a conference, and that deputies from both sides might come without  danger, and explain their wishes, and accordingly a fixed time was  appointed for the interview. When the deputies met the next day, a great  multitude from both sides assembled, and the expectations of every person  concerning this subject were raised very high, and their minds seemed to be  eagerly disposed for peace. Titus Labienus walked forward from the crowd,  and in submissive terms began to speak of peace, and to argue with  Vatinius. But their conversation was suddenly interrupted by darts thrown  from all sides, from which Vatinius escaped by being protected by the arms  of the soldiers. However, several were wounded; and among them Cornelius  Balbus, Marcus Plotius, and Lucius Tiburtius, centurions, and some  privates; hereupon Labienus exclaimed, "Forbear, then, to speak any more  about an accommodation, for we can have no peace unless we carry Caesar's  head back with us."

But it  happened, from the justice of Trebonius's decrees and his humanity (for he  thought that in such dangerous times justice should be administered with  moderation and compassion), that not one could be found who would offer  himself the first to lodge an appeal. For to plead poverty, to complain of his  own private calamities, or the general distresses of the times, or to assert the  difficulty of setting the goods to sale, is the behavior of a man even of a  moderate temper; but to retain their possessions entire, and at the same time  acknowledge themselves in debt, what sort of spirit, and what impudence  would it not have argued! Therefore nobody was found so unreasonable as  to make such demands. But Caelius proved more severe to those very  persons for whose advantage it had been designed; and starting from this  beginning, in order that he might not appear to have engaged in so  dishonorable an affair without effecting something, he promulgated a law  that all debts should be discharged in six equal payments, of six months  each, without interest.

Itaque, hoc qui postularet reperiebatur nemo. Atque ipsis, ad quorum commodum pertinebat, durior inventus est Caelius.

Quibus rebus permotus Caesar Brundisium ad suos severius scripsit, nacti idoneum ventum ne occasionem navigandi dimitterent, sive ad litora Apolloniatium [sive ad Labeatium] cursum dirigere atque eo naves eicere possent. Haec a custodiis classium loca maxime vacabant, quod se longius a portibus committere non audebant.

However, he did not desist from his  attempt, but hoped by the labor and perseverance of his seamen to be able to  bear up against the violence of the storm; and although we were carried  beyond Dyrrachium, by the violence of the wind, he nevertheless continued  to chase us. Our men, taking advantage of fortune's kindness, for they were  still afraid of being attacked by the enemy's fleet, if the wind abated, having  come near a port, called Nymphaeum, about three miles beyond Lissus, put  into it (this port is protected from a south-west wind, but is not secure  against a south wind); and thought less danger was to be apprehended from  the storm than from the enemy. But as soon as they were within the port, the  south wind, which had blown for two days, by extraordinary good luck  veered round to the south-west.

Otacilius Crassus, who  commanded Pompey's fleet, detached after them several barges and small  craft, and attempted to take them. At the same time, he treated with them  about capitulating, and promised them their lives if they would surrender.  One of them carried two hundred and twenty recruits, the other was manned  with somewhat less than two hundred veterans. Here it might be seen what  security men derive from a resolute spirit. For the recruits, frightened at the  number of vessels, and fatigued with the rolling of the sea, and with  sea-sickness, surrendered to Otacilius, after having first received his oath,  that the enemy would not injure them; but as soon as they were brought  before him, contrary to the obligation of his oath, they were inhumanly put  to death in his presence. But the soldiers of the veteran legion, who had also  struggled, not only with the inclemency of the weather, but by laboring at  the pump, thought it their duty to remit nothing of their former valor: and  having protracted the beginning of the night in settling the terms, under  pretense of surrendering, they obliged the pilot to run the ship aground: and  having got a convenient place on the shore, they spent the rest of the night  there, and at day-break, when Otacilius had sent against them a party of the  horse, who guarded that part of the coast, to the number of four hundred,  beside some armed men, who had followed them from the garrison, they  made a brave defense, and having killed some of them, retreated in safety to  our army.

Otacilius, apprehensive for his own safety, escaped out of the  town, and went to Pompey. All his forces, whose number amounted to three  veteran legions, and one of recruits, and about eight hundred horse being  landed, Antony sent most of his ships back to Italy, to transport the  remainder of the soldiers and horse. The pontons, which are a sort of Gallic  ships, he left at Lissus with this object, that if Pompey, imagining Italy  defenseless, should transport his army thither (and this notion was spread  among the common people), Caesar might have some means of pursuing  him; and he sent messengers to him with great dispatch, to inform him in  what part of the country he had landed his army, and what number of troops  he had brought over with him.

They directed their march after them by land; but at first they  were ignorant to what part they had been carried; but when they were  informed of it, they each adopted a different plan; Caesar, to form a junction  with Antonius as soon as possible; Pompey, to oppose Antonius's forces on  their march to Caesar, and, if possible, to fall upon them unexpectedly from  ambush. And the same day they both led out their armies from their winter  encampment along the river Apsus; Pompey, privately by night; Caesar,  openly by day. But Caesar had to march a longer circuit up the river to find  a ford. Pompey's route being easy, because he was not obliged to cross the  river, he advanced rapidly and by forced marches against Antonius, and  being informed of his approach, chose a convenient situation, where he  posted his forces; and kept his men close within camp, and forbade fires to  be kindled, that his arrival might be the more secret. An account of this was  immediately carried to Antonius by the Greeks. He dispatched messengers  to Caesar, and confined himself in his camp for one day. The next day  Caesar, came up with him. On learning his arrival, Pompey, to prevent his  being hemmed in between two armies, quitted his position, and went with  all his forces to Asparagium, in the territory of Dyrrachium, and there  encamped in a convenient situation.

He had also exacted from the tax-gatherers, two years' rents  that they owed; and enjoined them to lend him the amount of the next year,  and demanded a supply of horse from the whole province. When they were  collected, leaving behind him his neighboring enemies, the Parthians (who  shortly before had killed Marcus Crassus, the imperator, and had kept  Marcus Bibulus besieged), he drew his legions and cavalry out of Syria; and  when he came into the province, which was under great anxiety and fear of  the Parthian war, and heard some declarations of the soldiers, "That they  would march against an enemy, if he would lead them on; but would never  bear arms against a countryman and consul;" he drew off his legions to  winter quarters to Pergamus, and the most wealthy cities, and made them  rich presents: and in order to attach them more firmly to his interest,  permitted them to plunder the cities.

Besides,  many new imposts of different kinds were devised to gratify his avarice. A  tax of so much a head was laid on every slave and child. Columns, doors,  corn, soldiers, sailors, arms, engines, and carriages, were made subject to a  duty. Wherever a name could be found for any thing, it was deemed a  sufficient reason for levying money on it. Officers were appointed to collect  it, not only in the cities, but in almost every village and fort: and whosoever  of them acted with the greatest rigor and inhumanity, was esteemed the best  man, and best citizen. The province was overrun with bailiffs and officers,  and crowded with overseers and tax-gatherers; who, besides the duties  imposed, exacted a gratuity for themselves; for they asserted, that being  expelled from their own homes and countries, they stood in need of every  necessary; endeavoring by a plausible pretense, to color the most infamous  conduct. To this was added the most exorbitant interest, as usually happens  in times of war; the whole sums being called in, on which occasion, they  alleged that the delay of a single day was a donation. Therefore, in those two  years, the debt of the province was doubled: but notwithstanding, taxes were  exacted, not only from the Roman citizens, but from every corporation and  every state. And they said that these were loans, exacted by the senate's  decree. The taxes of the ensuing year were demanded beforehand as a loan  from the collectors, as on their first appointment.

Without making any delay in any part  of Macedonia, he marched with great haste against Domitius; and when he  was come within about twenty miles of him, wheeled on a sudden toward  Cassius Longinus in Thessaly. He effected this with such celerity, that news  of his march and arrival came together; for to render his march expeditious,  he left the baggage of his legions behind him at the river Haliacmon, which  divides Macedonia from Thessaly, under the care of Marcus Favonius, with  a guard of eight cohorts, and ordered him to build a strong fort there. At the  same time, Cotus's cavalry, which used to infest the neighborhood of  Macedonia, flew to attack Cassius's camp, at which Cassius being alarmed,  and having received information of Scipio's approach, and seen the horse,  which he imagined to be Scipio's, he betook himself to the mountains that  environ Thessaly, and thence began to make his route toward Ambracia. But  when Scipio was hastening to pursue him, dispatches overtook him from  Favonius, that Domitius was marching against him with his legions, and that  he could not maintain the garrison over which he was appointed, without  Scipio's assistance. On receipt of these dispatches, Scipio changed his  designs and his route, desisted from his pursuit of Cassius, and hastened to  relieve Favonius.

After a few days, he placed a party of horse in ambush in  the night, where our men had usually gone to forage for several days before.  And when Quintus Varus, commander of Domitius's horse, came there as  usual, they suddenly rushed from their ambush. But our men bravely  supported their charge, and returned quickly every man to his own rank, and  in their turn, made a general charge on the enemy; and having killed about  eighty of them, and put the rest to flight, retreated to their camp with the  loss of only two men.

Scipio being in readiness to pursue him,  detached his cavalry and a considerable number of light infantry to explore  Domitius's route. When they had marched a short way, and their foremost  troops were within reach of our ambush, their suspicions being raised by the  neighing of the horses, they began to retreat: and the rest who followed  them, observing with what speed they retreated, made a halt. Our men,  perceiving that the enemy had discovered their plot, and thinking it in vain  to wait for any more, having got two troops in their power, intercepted  them. Among them was Marcus Opimius, general of the horse, but he made  his escape: they either killed or took prisoners all the rest of these two  troops, and brought them to Domitius.

He carried over land, into the inner  part of the harbor, four galleys, by putting rollers under them, and driving  them on with levers. Then attacking on both sides the ships of war which  were moored to the shore, and were not manned, he carried off four of them,  and set the rest on fire. After dispatching this business, he left Decimus  Laelius, whom he had taken away from the command of the Asiatic fleet, to  hinder provisions from being brought into the town from Biblis and  Amantia, and went himself to Lissus, where he attacked thirty  merchantmen, left within the port by Antonius, and set them on fire. He  attempted to storm Lissus, but being delayed three days by the vigorous  defense of the Roman citizens who belonged to that district, and of the  soldiers which Caesar had sent to keep garrison there, and having lost a few  men in the assault, he returned without effecting his object.

But perceiving that he kept  within his trenches, he led his army back to his camp, and thought of  pursuing some other plan. Accordingly, the day following, he set out with  all his forces by a long circuit, through a difficult and narrow road to  Dyrrachium; hoping, either that Pompey would be compelled to follow him  to Dyrrachium, or that his communication with it might be cut off, because  he had deposited there all his provisions and material of war. And so it  happened; for Pompey, at first not knowing his design, because he imagined  he had taken a route in a different direction from that country, thought that  the scarcity of provisions had obliged him to shift his quarters; but having  afterward got true intelligence from his scouts, he decamped the day  following, hoping to prevent him by taking a shorter road; which Caesar  suspecting might happen, encouraged his troops to submit cheerfully to the  fatigue, and having halted a very small part of the night, he arrived early in  the morning at Dyrrachium, when the van of Pompey's army was visible at a  distance, and there he encamped.

Here he ordered  a part of his men of war to attend him, and corn and provisions to be  brought from Asia, and from all the countries of which he kept possession.  Caesar, imagining that the war would be protracted to too great a length, and  despairing of his convoys from Italy, because all the coasts were guarded  with great diligence by Pompey's adherents; and because his own fleets,  which he had built during the winter, in Sicily, Gaul, and Italy, were  detained; sent Lucius Canuleius into Epirus to procure corn; and because  these countries were too remote, he fixed granaries in certain places, and  regulated the carriage of the corn for the neighboring states. He likewise  gave directions that search should be made for whatever corn was in Lissus,  the country of the Parthini, and all the places of strength. The quantity was  very small, both from the nature of the land (for the country is rough and  mountainous, and the people commonly import what grain they use); and  because Pompey had foreseen what would happen, and some days before  had plundered the Parthini, and having ravaged and dug up their houses,  carried off all the corn, which he collected by means of his horse.

For  round Pompey's camps there were several high and rough hills. These he  first of all occupied with guards, and raised strong forts on them. Then  drawing a fortification from one fort to another, as the nature of each  position allowed, he began to draw a line of circumvallation round Pompey,  with these views; as he had but a small quantity of corn, and Pompey was  strong in cavalry, that he might furnish his army with corn and other  necessaries from all sides with less danger; secondly, to prevent Pompey  from foraging, and thereby render his horse ineffectual in the operations of  the war; and thirdly, to lessen his reputation, on which he saw he depended  greatly, among foreign nations, when a report should have spread  throughout the world that he was blockaded by Caesar, and dare not hazard  a battle.

Nothing was left but to  adopt the last resource, namely, to possess himself of as many hills as he  could, and cover as great an extent of country as possible with his troops,  and divide Caesar's forces as much as possible; and so it happened: for  having raised twenty-four forts, and taken in a compass of fifteen miles, he  got forage in this space, and within this circuit there were several fields  lately sown, in which the cattle might feed in the mean time. And as our  men, who had completed their works by drawing lines of communication  from one fort to another, were afraid that Pompey's men would sally out  from some part, and attack us in the rear; so the enemy were making a  continued fortification in a circuit within ours to prevent us from breaking  in on any side, or surrounding them on the rear. But they completed their  works first; both because they had a greater number of men, and because  they had a smaller compass to inclose. When Caesar attempted to gain any  place, though Pompey had resolved not to oppose him with his whole force,  or to come to a general engagement, yet he detached to particular places  slingers and archers, with which his army abounded, and several of our men  were wounded, and filled with great dread of the arrows; and almost all the  soldiers made coats or coverings for themselves of hair cloths, tarpaulins, or  raw hides to defend them against the weapons.

Caesar, to confine Pompey within as narrow a compass as possible;  Pompey, to occupy as many hills as he could in as large a circuit as possible,  and several skirmishes were fought in consequence of it. In one of these,  when Caesar's ninth legion had gained a certain post, and had begun to  fortify it, Pompey possessed himself of a hill near to and opposite the same  place, and endeavored to annoy the men while at work; and as the approach  on one side was almost level, he first surrounded it with archers and  slingers, and afterward by detaching a strong party of light infantry, and  using his engines, he stopped our works; and it was no easy matter for our  men at once to defend themselves, and to proceed with their fortifications.  When Caesar perceived that his troops were wounded from all sides, he  determined to retreat and give up the post; his retreat was down a precipice,  on which account they pushed on with more spirit, and would not allow us  to retire, because they imagined that we resigned the place through fear. It is  reported that Pompey said that day in triumph to his friends about him,  "That he would consent to be accounted a general of no experience, if  Caesar's legions effected a retreat without considerable loss from that  ground into which they had rashly advanced."

He himself disposed slingers in  convenient places to cover our men in their retreat. These things being  completed, he ordered his legions to file off: Pompey's men insultingly and  boldly pursued and chased us, leveling the hurdles that were thrown up in  the front of our works, in order to pass over the trench. Which as soon as  Caesar perceived, being afraid that his men would appear not to retreat, but  to be repulsed, and that greater loss might be sustained, when his men were  almost half way down the hill, he encouraged them by Antonius, who  commanded that legion, ordered the signal of battle to be sounded, and a  charge to be made on the enemy. The soldiers of the ninth legion suddenly  closing their files, threw their javelins, and advancing impetuously from the  low ground up the steep, drove Pompey's men precipitately before them, and  obliged them to turn their backs; but their retreat was greatly impeded by the  hurdles that lay in a long line before them, and the palisadoes which were in  their way, and the trenches that were sunk.

For all who have attempted to besiege any person,  have attacked the enemy when they were frightened or weak, or after a  defeat; or have been kept in fear of some attack, when they themselves have  had a superior force both of foot and horse. Besides, the usual design of a  siege is to cut off the enemy's supplies. On the contrary, Caesar, with an  inferior force, was inclosing troops sound and unhurt, and who had  abundance of all things. For there arrived every day a prodigious number of  ships, which brought them provisions: nor could the wind blow from any  point, that would not be favorable to some of them. Whereas, Caesar,  having consumed all the corn far and near, was in very great distress, but his  soldiers bore all with uncommon patience. For they remembered that they  lay under the same difficulties last year in Spain, and yet by labor and  patience had concluded a dangerous war. They recollected too that they had  suffered an alarming scarcity at Alesia, and a much greater at Avaricum, and  yet had returned victorious over mighty nations. They refused neither barley  nor pulse when offered them, and they held in great esteem cattle, of which  they got great quantities from Epirus.

For they were  often told by deserters, that they could scarcely maintain their horses, and  that their other cattle was dead: that they themselves were not in good health  from their confinement within so narrow a compass, from the noisome  smell, the number of carcasses, and the constant fatigue to them, being men  unaccustomed to work, and laboring under a great want of water. For Caesar  had either turned the course of all the rivers and streams which ran to the  sea, or had dammed them up with strong works. And as the country was  mountainous, and the valleys narrow at the bottom, he inclosed them with  piles sunk in the ground, and heaped up mold against them to keep in the  water. They were therefore obliged to search for low and marshy grounds,  and to sink wells, and they had this labor in addition to their daily works.  And even these springs were at a considerable distance from some of their  posts, and soon dried up with the heat. But Caesar's army enjoyed perfect  health and abundance of water, and had plenty of all sorts of provisions  except corn; and they had a prospect of better times approaching, and saw  greater hopes laid before them by the ripening of the grain.

 <span class="margnote"><font color="GREEN" size="-1"><a name="civ_3_51">3:51</a></font></span>In the mean time, Publius Sylla, whom  Caesar at his departure had left governor of his camp, came up with two  legions to assist the cohort; upon whose arrival Pompey's forces were easily  repulsed. Nor did they stand the sight and charge of our men, and the  foremost falling, the rest turned their backs and quitted the field. But Sylla  called our men in from the pursuit, lest their ardor should carry them too far,  but most people imagine that if he had consented to a vigorous pursuit, the  war might have been ended that day. His conduct however does not appear  to deserve censure; for the duties of a lieutenant-general, and of a  commander-in-chief, are very different; the one is bound to act entirely  according to his instructions, the other to regulate his conduct without  control, as occasion requires. Sylla, being deputed by Caesar to take care of  the camp, and having rescued his men, was satisfied with that, and did not  desire to hazard a battle (although this circumstance might probably have  had a successful issue), that he might not be thought to have assumed the  part of the general. One circumstance laid the Pompeians under great  difficulty in making good a retreat: for they had advanced from  disadvantageous ground, and were posted on the top of a hill. If they  attempted to retire down the steep, they dreaded the pursuit of our men from  the rising ground, and there was but a short time till sunset: for in hopes of  completing the business, they had protracted the battle almost till night.  Taking therefore measures suited to their exigency, and to the shortness of  the time, Pompey possessed himself of an eminence, at such a distance from  our fort that no weapon discharged from an engine could reach him. Here he  took up a position, and fortified it, and kept all his forces there.

 Interim certior factus P. Sulla, quem discedens catris praefecerat Caesar, auxillo cohorti venit cum legionibus duabus; cuius adventu facile sunt repulsi Pompeiani. Neque vero conspectum aut impetum nostrorum tulerunt, primisque deiectis reliqui se verterunt et loco cesserunt. Sed insequentes nostros, ne longius prosequerentur, Sulla revocavit. At plerique existimant, si acrius insequi voluisset, bellum eo die potuisse finire. Cuius consilium reprehendendum non videtur. Aliae enim sunt legati partes atque imperatoris: alter omnia agere ad praescriptum, alter libere ad summam rerum consulere debet. Sulla a Caesare in castris relictus liberatis suis hoc fuit contentus neque proelio decertare voluit, quae res tamen fortasse aliquem reciperet casum, ne imperatorias sibi partes sumpsisse videretur. Pompeianis magnam res ad receptum difficultatem afferebat. Nam ex iniquo progressi loco in summo constiterant; si per declive sese reciperent, nostros ex superiore insequentes loco verebantur; neque multum ad solis occasum temporis supererat; spe enim conficiendi negotii prope in noctem rem duxerant. Ita necessario atque ex tempore capto consilio Pompeius tumulum quendam occupavit, qui tantum aberat a nostro castello, ut telum tormento missum adigi non posset. Hoc consedit loco atque eum communivit omnesque ibi copias continuit.

Among them was Valerius, the son of Lucius Flaccus, who as  praetor had formerly had the government of Asia, and six military standards  were taken. Of our men, not more than twenty were missing in all the  action. But in the fort, not a single soldier escaped without a wound; and in  one cohort, four centurions lost their eyes. And being desirous to produce  testimony of the fatigue they under went, and the danger they sustained, they  counted to Caesar about thirty thousand arrows which had been thrown into  the fort; and in the shield of the centurion Scaeva, which was brought to  him, were found two hundred and thirty holes. In reward for this man's  services, both to himself and the public, Caesar presented to him two  hundred thousand pieces of copper money, and declared him promoted from  the eighth to the first centurion. For it appeared that the fort had been in a  great measure saved by his exertions; and he afterward very amply rewarded  the cohorts with double pay, corn, clothing, and other military honors.

Upon  notice of their approach, Rutilius Lupus, who commanded in Achaia, under  Pompey, began to fortify the Isthmus, to prevent Fufius from coming into  Achaia. Kalenus recovered Delphi, Thebes, and Orchomenus, by a  voluntary submission of those states. Some he subdued by force, the rest he  endeavored to win over to Caesar's interest, by sending deputies round to  them. In these things, principally, Fusius was employed.

To this man he gave letters and instructions to Pompey,  the substance of which was as follows: "That he had made every effort  toward peace, and imputed the ill success of those efforts to the fault of  those whom he had employed to conduct those negotiations; because they  were afraid to carry his proposals to Pompey at an improper time. That  Scipio had such authority, that he could not only freely explain what  conduct met his approbation, but even in some degree enforce his advice,  and govern him [Pompey] if he persisted in error; that he commanded an  army independent of Pompey, so that besides his authority, he had strength  to compel; and if he did so, all men would be indebted to him for the quiet  of Italy, the peace of the provinces, and the preservation of the empire."  These proposals Clodius made to him, and for some days at the first  appeared to have met with a favorable reception, but afterward was not  admitted to an audience; for Scipio being reprimanded by Favonius, as we  found afterward when the war was ended, and the negotiation having  miscarried, Clodius returned to Caesar.

Pompey perceiving that he derived no  advantage from his cavalry, after a few days had them conveyed back to his  camp by sea. Fodder was so exceedingly scarce that he was obliged to feed  his horses upon leaves stripped off the trees, or the tender roots of reeds  pounded. For the corn which had been sown within the lines was already  consumed, and they would be obliged to supply themselves with fodder  from Corcyra and Acarnania, over a long tract of sea; and as the quantity of  that fell short, to increase it by mixing barley with it, and by these methods  support their cavalry. But when not only the barley and fodder in these parts  were consumed, and the herbs cut away, when the leaves too were not to be  found on the trees, the horses being almost starved, Pompey thought he  ought to make some attempt by a sally.

To them, for these reasons, he had committed the offices of  greatest honor in their own country, and took care to have them chosen into  the senate at an unusual age, and had bestowed on them lands taken from  the enemy, and large pecuniary rewards, and from being needy had made  them affluent. Their valor had not only procured them Caesar's esteem, but  they were beloved by the whole army. But presuming on Caesar's  friendship, and elated with the arrogance natural to a foolish and barbarous  people, they despised their countrymen, defrauded their cavalry of their pay,  and applied all the plunder to their own use. Displeased at this conduct, their  soldiers went in a body to Caesar, and openly complained of their ill usage;  and to their other charges added, that false musters were given in to Caesar,  and the surcharged pay applied to their own use.

This  however, gave them great offense, and made them contemptible in the eyes  of the whole army. Of this they became sensible, as well from the  reproaches of others, as from the judgment of their own minds, and a  consciousness of guilt. Prompted then by shame, and perhaps imagining that  they were not liberated from trial, but reserved to a future day, they resolved  to break off from us, to put their fortune to a new hazard, and to make trial  of new connections. And having conferred with a few of their clients, to  whom they could venture to intrust so base an action, they first attempted to  assassinate Caius Volusenus, general of the horse (as was discovered at the  end of the war), that they might appear to have fled to Pompey after  conferring an important service on him. But when that appeared too difficult  to put in execution, and no opportunity offered to accomplish it, they  borrowed all the money they could, as if they designed to make satisfaction  and restitution for what they had defrauded: and having purchased a great  number of horses, they deserted to Pompey along with those whom they had  engaged in their plot.

At an interval of six hundred feet from that  there was another rampart turned the contrary way, with the works lower.  For some days before, Caesar, apprehending that our men might be  surrounded by sea, had made a double rampart there, that if he should be  attacked on both sides, he might have the means of defending himself. But  the extent of the lines, and the incessant labor for so many days, because he  had inclosed a circuit of seventeen miles with his works, did not allow time  to finish them. Therefore the transverse rampart which should make a  communication between the other two, was not yet completed. This  circumstance was known to Pompey, being told to him by the Allobrogian  deserters, and proved of great disadvantage to us. For when our cohorts of  the ninth legion were on guard by the sea-side, Pompey's army arrived  suddenly by break of day, and their approach was a surprise to our men, and  at the same time, the soldiers that came by sea, cast their darts on the front  rampart; and the ditches were filled with fascines: and the legionary soldiers  terrified those that defended the inner rampart, by applying the scaling  ladders, and by engines and weapons of all sorts, and a vast multitude of  archers poured round upon them from every side. Besides, the coverings of  oziers, which they had laid over their helmets, were a great security to them  against the blows of stones which were the only weapons that our soldiers  had. And therefore, when our men were oppressed in every manner, and  were scarcely able to make resistance, the defect in our works was observed,  and Pompey's soldiers, landing between the two ramparts, where the work  was unfinished, attacked our men in the rear, and having beat them from  both sides of the fortification, obliged them to flee.

His arrival checked  the Pompeians, and encouraged our men to recover from their extreme  affright. And shortly after, Caesar having got notice by the smoke of all the  forts, which was the usual signal on such occasions, drafted off some  cohorts from the outposts, and went to the scene of action. And having there  learned the loss he had sustained, and perceiving that Pompey had forced  our works, and had encamped along the coast, so that he was at liberty to  forage, and had a communication with his shipping, he altered his plan for  conducting the war, as his design had not succeeded, and ordered a strong  encampment to be made near Pompey.

The  situation of the two camps was as follows: a few days before, when Caesar's  ninth legion had opposed a party of Pompey's troops, and were endeavoring  to inclose them, Caesar's troops formed a camp in that place. This camp  joined a certain wood, and was not above four hundred paces distant from  the sea. Afterward, changing his design for certain reasons, Caesar removed  his camp to a small distance beyond that place; and after a few days,  Pompey took possession of it, and added more extensive works, leaving the  inner rampart standing, as he intended to keep several legions there. By this  means, the lesser camp, included within the greater, answered the purpose  of a fort and citadel. He had also carried an intrenchment from the left angle  of the camp to the river, about four hundred paces, that his soldiers might  have more liberty and less danger in fetching water. But he too, changing  his design for reasons not necessary to be mentioned, abandoned the place.  In this condition the camp remained for several days, the works being all  entire.

That the same thing was seen  he was assured by those in the higher forts. This place was a half a mile  distant from Pompey's new camp. Caesar, hoping to surprise this legion, and  anxious to repair the loss sustained that day, left two cohorts employed in  the works to make an appearance of intrenching himself, and by a different  route, as privately as he could, with his other cohorts amounting to  thirty-three, among which was the ninth legion, which had lost so many  centurions, and whose privates were greatly reduced in number, he marched  in two lines against Pompey's legion and his lesser camp. Nor did this first  opinion deceive him. For he reached the place before Pompey could have  notice of it; and though the works were strong, yet having made the attack  with the left wing which he commanded in person, he obliged the  Pompeians to quit the rampart in disorder. A barricade had been raised  before the gates, at which a short contest was maintained, our men  endeavoring to force their way in, and the enemy to defend the camp; Titus  Pulcio, by whose means we have related that Caius Antonius's army was  betrayed, defending them with singular courage. But the valor of our men  prevailed, and having cut down the barricade, they first forced the greater  camp, and after that the fort which was inclosed within it; and as the legion  on its repulse had retired to this, they slew several defending themselves  there.

For the cohorts on Caesar's right  wing, through ignorance of the place, followed the direction of that rampart  which ran along from the camp to the river, while they were in search of a  gate, and imagined that it belonged to the camp.

For Pompey's  legion, encouraged by the hope of speedy support, attempted to make a  stand at the Decuman gate, and made a bold charge on our men. Caesar's  cavalry, who had mounted the rampart by a narrow breach, being  apprehensive of their retreat, were the first to flee. The right wing which had  been separated from the left, observing the terror of the cavalry, to prevent  their being overpowered within the lines, were endeavoring to retreat by the  same way as they burst in; and most of them, lest they should be engaged in  the narrow passes, threw themselves down a rampart ten feet high into the  trenches; and the first being trodden to death, the rest procured their safety,  and escaped over their bodies. The soldiers of the left wing, perceiving from  the rampart that Pompey was advancing, and their own friends fleeing,  being afraid that they should be inclosed between the two ramparts, as they  had an enemy both within and without, strove to secure their retreat the  same way they came. All was disorder, consternation, and flight; insomuch  that, when Caesar laid hold of the colors of those who were running away,  and desired them to stand, some left their horses behind, and continued to  run in the same manner; others through fear even threw away their colors.  Nor did a single man face about.

Thus a trifling circumstance proved of great  importance to each party; for the rampart drawn from the camp to the river,  interrupted the progress and certainty of Caesar's victory, after he had forged  Pompey's camp.

But the greatest part of all these perished  without a wound, being trodden to death in the trenches, on the ramparts  and banks of the river by reason of the terror and flight of their own men.  Pompey, after this battle, was saluted Imperator; this title he retained, and  allowed himself to be addressed by it afterward. But neither in his letters to  the senate, nor in the fasces, did he use the laurel as a mark of honor. But  Labienus, having obtained his consent that the prisoners should be delivered  up to him, had them all brought out, as it appeared, to make a show of them,  and that Pompey might place a greater confidence in him who was a  deserter; and calling them fellow soldiers, and asking them in the most  insulting manner whether it was usual with veterans to flee, ordered them to  be put to death in the sight of the whole army.

They did not consider that the smallness of our numbers, and  the disadvantage of the place and the confined nature of the ground  occasioned by their having first possessed themselves of the camp, and the  double danger both from within and without the fortifications, and the  separation of the army into two parts, so that the one could not give relief to  the other, were the causes of our defeat. They did not consider, in addition,  that the contest was not decided by a vigorous attack, nor a regular battle;  and that our men had suffered greater loss from their numbers and want of  room, than they had sustained from the enemy. In fine, they did not reflect  on the common casualties of war; how trifling causes, either from  groundless suspicions, sudden affright, or religious scruples, have  oftentimes been productive of considerable losses; how often an army has  been unsuccessful either by the misconduct of the general, or the oversight  of a tribune; but as if they had proved victorious by their valor, and as if no  change could ever take place, they published the success of the day  throughout the world by reports and letters.

That they ought to be grateful to Fortune, through whose favor they had  recovered Italy without the effusion of blood; through whose favor they had  subdued the two Spains, though protected by a most warlike people under  the command of the most skillful and experienced generals; through whose  favor they had reduced to submission the neighboring states that abounded  with corn; in fine, that they ought to remember with what success they had  been all transported safe through blockading fleets of the enemy, which  possessed not only the ports, but even the coasts; that if all their attempts  were not crowned with success, the defects of Fortune must be supplied by  industry; and whatever loss had been sustained, ought to be attributed rather  to her caprices than to any faults in him: that he had chosen a safe ground  for the engagement, that he had possessed himself of the enemy's camp; that  he had beaten them out, and overcome them when they offered resistance;  but whether their own terror or some mistake, or whether Fortune herself  had interrupted a victory almost secured and certain, they ought all now to  use their utmost efforts to repair by their valor the loss which had been  incurred; if they did so, their misfortunes would turn to their advantage, as it  happened at Gergovia, and those who feared to face the enemy would be the  first to offer themselves to battle.

Accordingly,  Caesar dispatching couriers, writes to Domitius, and acquaints him with his  wishes on the subject: and having stationed a garrison of four cohorts at  Apollonia, one at Lissus, and three at Oricum, besides those who were sick  of their wounds, he set forward on his march through Epirus and Acarnania.  Pompey, also, guessing at Caesar's design, determined to hasten to Scipio,  that if Caesar should march in that direction, he might be ready to relieve  him; but that if Caesar should be unwilling to quit the sea-coast and  Corcyra, because he expected legions and cavalry from Italy, he himself  might fall on Domitius with all his forces.

 Caesari ad saucios deponendos, stipendium exercitui dandum, socios confirmandos, praesidium urbibus relinquendum necesse erat adire Apolloniam. Sed his rebus tantum temporis tribuit, quantum erat properanti necesse; timens Domitio, ne adventu Pompei praeoccuparetur, ad eum omni celeritate et studio incitatus ferebatur. Totius autem rei consilium his rationibus explicabat, ut, si Pompeius eodem contenderet, abductum ilium a mari atque ab eis copiis, quas Dyrrachii comparaverat, abstractum pari condicione belli secum decertare cogeret; si in Italiam transiret, coniuncto exercitu cum Domitio per Illyricum Italiae subsidio proficisceretur; si Apolloniam Oricumque oppugnare et se omni maritima ora excludere conaretur, obsesso Scipione necessario illum suis auxilium ferre cogeret. Itaque praemissis nuntiis ad Cn. Domitium Caesar ei scripsit et, quid fieri vellet, ostendit, praesidioque Apolloniae cohortibus IIII, Lissi I, III Orici relictis, quique erant ex vulneribus aegri depositis, per Epirum atque Athamaniam iter facere coepit. Pompeius quoque de Caesaris consilio coniectura iudicans ad Scipionem properandum sibi existimabat: si Caesar iter illo haberet, ut subsidium Scipioni ferret; si ab ora maritima Oricoque discedere nollet, quod legiones equitatumque ex Italia exspectaret, ipse ut omnibus copiis Domitium aggrederetur.

But Caesar's engagements at Apollonia had carried  him aside from the direct road. Pompey had taken the short road to  Macedonia, through Candavia. To this was added another unexpected  disadvantage, that Domitius, who for several days had been encamped  opposite Scipio, had quitted that post for the sake of provisions, and had  marched to Heraclea Sentica, a city subject to Candavia; so that fortune  herself seemed to throw him in Pompey's way. Of this, Caesar was ignorant  up to this time. Letters likewise being sent by Pompey through all the  provinces and states, with an account of the action at Dyrrachium, very  much enlarged and exaggerated beyond the real facts, a rumor had been  circulated, that Caesar had been defeated and forced to flee, and had lost  almost all his forces. These reports had made the roads dangerous, and  drawn off some states from his alliance: whence it happened, that the  messengers dispatched by Caesar, by several different roads to Domitius,  and by Domitius to Caesar, were not able by any means to accomplish their  journey. But the Allobroges, who were in the retinue of Aegus and  Roscillus, and who had deserted to Pompey, having met on the road a  scouting party of Domitius; either from old acquaintance, because they had  served together in Gaul, or elated with vain glory, gave them an account of  all that had happened, and informed them of Caesar's departure, and  Pompey's arrival. Domitius, who was scarce four hours' march distant,  having got intelligence from these, by the courtesy of the enemy, avoided  the danger, and met Caesar coming to join him at Aeginium, a town on the  confines of and opposite to Thessaly.

Now, the Thessalians, a few months before, had of themselves sent  embassadors to Caesar, offering him the free use of every thing in their  power, and requesting a garrison for their protection. But the report, already  spoken of, of the battle at Dyrrachium, which it had exaggerated in many  particulars, had arrived before him. In consequence of which, Androsthenes,  the praetor of Thessaly, as he preferred to be the companion of Pompey's  victory, rather than Caesar's associate in his misfortunes, collected all the  people, both slaves and freemen from the country into the town and shut the  gates, and dispatched messengers to Scipio and Pompey "to come to his  relief, that he could depend on the strength of the town, if succor was  speedily sent; but that it could not withstand a long siege." Scipio, as soon  as he received advice of the departure of the armies from Dyrrachium, had  marched with his legions to Larissa: Pompey was not yet arrived near  Thessaly. Caesar having fortified his camp, ordered scaling-ladders and  pent-houses to be made for a sudden assault, and hurdles to be provided. As  soon as they were ready, he exhorted his soldiers, and told them of what  advantage it would be to assist them with all sorts of necessaries, if they  made themselves masters of a rich and plentiful town: and, at the same time  to strike terror into other states by the example of this, and to effect this  with speed, before auxiliaries could arrive. Accordingly, taking advantage of  the unusual ardor of the soldiers, he began his assault on the town at a little  after three o'clock on the very day on which he arrived, and took it, though  defended with very high walls, before sunset, and gave it up to his army to  plunder, and immediately decamped from before it, and marched to  Metropolis, with such rapidity as to outstrip any messenger or rumor of the  taking of Gomphi.

And receiving all  the legions into one camp, he shared his honors with Scipio, ordered the  trumpet to be sounded at his tent, and a pavilion to be erected for him. The  forces of Pompey being thus augmented, and two such powerful armies  united, their former expectations were confirmed, and their hopes of victory  so much increased, that whatever time intervened was considered as so  much delay to their return into Italy; and whenever Pompey acted with  slowness and caution, they used to exclaim, that it was the business only of  a single day, but that he had a passion for power, and was delighted in  having persons of consular and praetorian rank in the number of his slaves.  And they now began to dispute openly about rewards and priesthoods, and  disposed of the consulate for several years to come. Others put in their  claims for the houses and properties of all who were in Caesar's camp, and  in that council there was a warm debate, whether Lucius Hirtius, who had  been sent by Pompey against the Parthians, should be admitted a candidate  for the praetorship in his absence at the next election; his friends imploring  Pompey's honor to fulfill the engagements which he had made to him at his  departure, that he might not seem deceived through his authority: while  others, embarked in equal labor and danger, pleaded that no individual  ought to have a preference before all the rest.

Lentulus urging the respect due  to his age, Domitius boasting his interest in the city and his dignity, and  Scipio presuming on his alliance with Pompey. Attius Rufus charged Lucius  Afranius before Pompey with betraying the army in the action that happened  in Spain, and Lucius Domitius declared in the council that it was his wish  that, when the war should be ended, three billets should be given to all the  senators, who had taken part with them in the war, and that they should pass  sentence on every single person who had staid behind at Rome, or who had  been within Pompey's garrisons and had not contributed their assistance in  the military operations; that by the first billet they should have power to  acquit, by the second to pass sentence of death, and by the third to impose a  pecuniary fine. In short, Pompey's whole army talked of nothing but the  honors or sums of money which were to be their rewards, or of vengeance  on their enemies; and never considered how they were to defeat their  enemies, but in what manner they should use their victory.

Accordingly he led his  troops out of the camp, and ranged them in order of battle, at first on their  own ground, and at a small distance from Pompey's camp: but afterward for  several days in succession, he advanced from his own camp, and led them  up to the hills on which Pompey's troops were posted, which conduct  inspired his army every day with fresh courage. However he adhered to his  former purpose respecting his cavalry, for as he was by many degrees  inferior in number, he selected the youngest and most active of the advanced  guard, and desired them to fight intermixed with the horse, and they by  constant practice acquired experience in this kind of battle. By these means  it was brought to pass that a thousand of his horse would dare even on open  ground, to stand against seven thousand of Pompey's, if occasion required,  and would not be much terrified by their number. For even on one of those  days he was successful in a cavalry action, and killed one of the two  Allobrogians, who had deserted to Pompey, as we before observed, and  several others.

Caesar, seeing no likelihood of being able to bring Pompey to an  action, judged it the most expedient method of conducting the war, to  decamp from that post and to be always in motion: with this hope, that by  shifting his camp and removing from place to place, he might be more  conveniently supplied with corn, and also, that by being in motion he might  get some opportunity of forcing them to battle, and might by constant  marches harass Pompey's army, which was not accustomed to fatigue. These  matters being settled, when the signal for marching was given, and the tents  struck, it was observed that shortly before, contrary to his daily practice,  Pompey's army had advanced further than usual from his intrenchments, so  that it appeared possible to come to an action on equal ground. Then Caesar  addressed himself to his soldiers, when they were at the gates of the camp,  ready to march out. " We must defer," says he, "our march at present, and  set our thoughts on battle, which has been our constant wish; let us then  meet the foe with resolute souls.

Have you not heard that the cohorts at Brundusium are composed  of invalids? The forces which you now behold, have been recruited by  levies lately made in Hither Spain, and the greater part from the colonies  beyond the Po; moreover, the flower of the forces perished in the two  engagements at Dyrrachium." Having so said, he took an oath, never to  return to his camp unless victorious; and he encouraged the rest to do the  like. Pompey applauded his proposal, and took the same oath; nor did any  person present hesitate to take it. After this had passed in the council they  broke up full of hopes and joy, and in imagination anticipated victory;  because they thought that in a matter of such importance, no groundless  assertion could be made by a general of such experience.

Here Pompey commanded in  person. Scipio with the Syrian legions commanded the center. The Cilician  legion in conjunction with the Spanish cohorts, which we said were brought  over by Afranius, were disposed on the right wing. These Pompey  considered his steadiest troops. The rest he had interspersed between the  center and the wing, and he had a hundred and ten complete cohorts; these  amounted to forty-five thousand men. He had besides two cohorts of  volunteers, who having received favors from him in former wars, flocked to  his standard: these were dispersed through his whole army. The seven  remaining cohorts he had disposed to protect his camp, and the neighboring  forts. His right wing was secured by a river with steep banks; for which  reason he placed all his cavalry, archers, and slingers, on his left wing.

At the same time, fearing, from the disposition of the enemy which  we have previously mentioned, lest his right wing might be surrounded by  their numerous cavalry, he rapidly drafted a single cohort from each of the  legions composing the third line, formed of them a fourth line, and opposed  them to Pompey's cavalry, and, acquainting them with his wishes,  admonished them that the success of that day depended on their courage. At  the same time he ordered the third line, and the entire army not to charge  without his command: that he would give the signal whenever he wished  them to do so.

And he is said to have  done this by the advice of Caius Triarius, that the impetuosity of the charge  of Caesar's soldiers might be checked, and their line broken, and that  Pompey's troops remaining in their ranks, might attack them while in  disorder; and he thought that the javelins would fall with less force if the  soldiers were kept in their ground, than if they met them in their course; at  the same time he trusted that Caesar's soldiers, after running over double the  usual ground, would become weary and exhausted by the fatigue. But to me  Pompey seems to have acted without sufficient reason: for there is a certain  impetuosity of spirit and an alacrity implanted by nature in the hearts of all  men, which is inflamed by a desire to meet the foe. This a general should  endeavor not to repress, but to increase; nor was it a vain institution of our  ancestors, that the trumpets should sound on all sides, and a general shout  be raised; by which they imagined that the enemy were struck with terror,  and their own army inspired with courage.

Nor did Pompey's  men fail in this crisis, for they received our javelins, stood our charge, and  maintained their ranks; and having launched their javelins, had recourse to  their swords. At the same time Pompey's horse, according to their orders,  rushed out at once from his left wing, and his whole host of archers poured  after them. Our cavalry did not withstand their charge: but gave ground a  little, upon which Pompey's horse pressed them more vigorously, and began  to file off in troops, and flank our army. When Caesar perceived this, he  gave the signal to his fourth line, which he had formed of the six cohorts.  They instantly rushed forward and charged Pompey's horse with such fury,  that not a man of them stood; but all wheeling about, not only quitted their  post, but galloped forward to seek a refuge in the highest mountains. By  their retreat the archers and slingers, being left destitute and defenseless,  were all cut to pieces. The cohorts, pursuing their success, wheeled about  upon Pompey's left wing, while his infantry still continued to make battle,  and attacked them in the rear.

Thus, new and fresh troops having come to the assistance of the fatigued,  and others having made an attack on their rear, Pompey's men were not able  to maintain their ground, but all fled, nor was Caesar deceived in his  opinion, that the victory, as he had declared in his speech to his soldiers,  must have its beginning from those six cohorts, which he had placed as a  fourth line to oppose the horse. For by them the cavalry were routed; by  them the archers and slingers were cut to pieces; by them the left wing of  Pompey's army was surrounded, and obliged to be the first to flee. But when  Pompey saw his cavalry routed, and that part of his army on which he  reposed his greatest hopes thrown into confusion, despairing of the rest, he  quitted the field, and retreated straightway on horseback to his camp, and  calling to the centurions, whom he had placed to guard the praetorian gate,  with a loud voice, that the soldiers might hear: "Secure the camp," says he,  "defend it with diligence, if any danger should threaten it; I will visit the  other gates, and encourage the guards of the camp." Having thus said, he  retired into his tent in utter despair, yet anxiously waiting the issue.

The  camp was bravely defended by the cohorts which had been left to guard it,  but with much more spirit by the Thracians and foreign auxiliaries.

He lay at anchor one night, and calling together his friends in Amphipolis,  and collecting a sum of money for his necessary expenses, upon advice of  Caesar's approach, set sail from that place, and arrived in a few days at  Mitylene. Here he was detained two days, and having added a few galleys to  his fleet he went to Cilicia, and thence to Cyprus. There he is informed that,  by the consent of all the inhabitants of Antioch and Roman citizens who  traded there, the castle had been seized to shut him out of the town; and that  messengers had been dispatched to all those who were reported to have  taken refuge in the neighboring states, that they should not come to Antioch;  that if they did, that it would be attended with imminent danger to their  lives. The same thing had happened to Lucius Lentulus, who had been  consul the year before, and to Publius Lentulus a consular senator, and to  several others at Rhodes, who having followed Pompey in his flight, and  arrived at the island, were not admitted into the town or port; and having  received a message to leave that neighborhood, set sail much against their  will; for the rumor of Caesar's approach had now reached those states.

 Caesar omnibus rebus relictis persequendum sibi Pompeium existimavit, quascumque in partes se ex fuga recepisset, ne rursus copias comparare alias et bellum renovare posset, et quantumcumque itineris equitatu efficere poterat, cotidie progrediebatur legionemque unam minoribus itineribus subsequi iussit. Erat edictum Pompei nomine Amphipoli propositum, uti omnes eius provinciae iuniores, Graeci civesque Romani, iurandi causa convenirent. Sed utrum avertendae suspicionis causa Pompeius proposuisset, ut quam diutissime longioris fugae consilium occultaret, an ut novis dilectibus, si nemo premeret, Macedoniam tenere conaretur, existimari non poterat. Ipse ad ancoram unam noctem constitit et vocatis ad se Amphipoli hospitibus et pecunia ad necessarios sumptus corrogata, cognito Caesaris adventu, ex eo loco discessit et Mytilenas paucis diebus venit.

Idem hoc L. Lentulo, qui superiore anno consul fuerat, et P. Lentulo consulari ac nonnullis aliis acciderat Rhodi; qui cum ex fuga Pompeium sequerentur atque in insulam venissent, oppido ac portu recepti non erant missisque ad eos nuntiis, ut ex his locis discederent contra voluntatem suam naves solverant.

It happened that king Ptolemy, a minor,  was there with a considerable army, engaged in war with his sister  Cleopatra, whom a few months before, by the assistance of his relations and  friends, he had expelled from the kingdom; and her camp lay at a small  distance from his. To him Pompey applied to be permitted to take refuge in  Alexandria, and to be protected in his calamity by his powerful assistance,  in consideration of the friendship and amity which had subsisted between  his father and him. But Pompey's deputies having executed their  commission, began to converse with less restraint with the king's troops, and  to advise them to act with friendship to Pompey, and not to think meanly of  his bad fortune. In Ptolemy's army were several of Pompey's soldiers, of  whom Gabinius had received the command in Syria, and had brought them  over to Alexandria, and at the conclusion of the war had left with Ptolemy  the father of the young king.

Thus, on two occasions, Caesar  saved the money of Ephesus. It was also remarked at Elis, in the temple of  Minerva, upon calculating and enumerating the days, that on the very day on  which Caesar had gained his battle, the image of Victory which was placed  before Minerva, and faced her statue, turned about toward the portal and  entrance of the temple; and the same day, at Antioch in Syria, such a shout  of an army and sound of trumpets was twice heard that the citizens ran in  arms to the walls. The same thing happened at Ptolemais; a sound of drums  too was heard at Pergamus, in the private and retired parts of the temple,  into which none but the priests are allowed admission, and which the  Greeks call Adyta (the inaccessible), and likewise at Tralles, in the temple  of Victory, in which there stood a statue consecrated to Caesar; a palm-tree  at that time was shown that had sprouted up from the pavement, through the  joints of the stones, and shot up above the roof.

These legions amounted but to three  thousand two hundred men; the rest, disabled by wounds received in various  battles, by fatigue and the length of their march, could not follow him. But  Caesar, relying on the fame of his exploits, did not hesitate to set forward  with a feeble force, and thought that he would be secure in any place. At  Alexandria he was informed of the death of Pompey: and at his landing  there, heard a cry among the soldiers whom the king had left to garrison the  town, and saw a crowd gathering toward him, because the fasces were  carried before him; for this the whole multitude thought an infringement of  the king's dignity. Though this tumult was appeased, frequent disturbances  were raised for several days successively, by crowds of the populace, and a  great many of his soldiers were killed in all parts of the city.

Caesar's forces were by  no means so strong that he could trust to them, if he had occasion to hazard  a battle without the town. His only resource was to keep within the town in  the most convenient places, and get information of Achillas's designs.  However he ordered his soldiers to repair to their arms; and advised the king  to send some of his friends, who had the greatest influence, as deputies to  Achillas, and to signify his royal pleasure. Dioscorides and Serapion, the  persons sent by him, who had both been embassadors at Rome, and had  been in great esteem with Ptolemy the father, went to Achillas. But as soon  as they appeared in his presence, without hearing them, or learning the  occasion of their coming, he ordered them to be seized and put to death.  One of them, after receiving a wound, was taken up and carried off by his  attendants as dead: the other was killed on the spot. Upon this, Caesar took  care to secure the king's person, both supposing that the king's name would  have a great influence with his subjects, and to give the war the appearance  of the scheme of a few desperate men, rather than of having been begun by  the king's consent.

They consisted partly of Gabinius's  soldiers, who were now become habituated to the licentious mode of living  at Alexandria, and had forgotten the name and discipline of the Roman  people, and had married wives there, by whom the greatest part of them had  children. To these was added a collection of highwaymen, and freebooters,  from Syria, and the province of Cilicia, and the adjacent countries. Besides  several convicts and transports had been collected: for at Alexandria all our  runaway slaves were sure of finding protection for their persons on the  condition that they should give in their names, and enlist as soldiers: and if  any of them was apprehended by his master, he was rescued by a crowd of  his fellow soldiers, who being involved in the same guilt, repelled, at the  hazard of their lives, every violence offered to any of their body. These by a  prescriptive privilege of the Alexandrian army, used to demand the king's  favorites to be put to death, pillage the properties of the rich to increase their  pay, invest the king's palace, banish some from the kingdom, and recall  others from exile. Besides these, there were two thousand horse, who had  acquired the skill of veterans by being in several wars in Alexandria. These  had restored Ptolemy the father to his kingdom, had killed Bibulus's two  sons; and had been engaged in war with the Egyptians; such was their  experience in military affairs.

At first  he attempted to force the palace; but Caesar had disposed his cohorts  through the streets, and repelled his attack. At the same time there was an  action at the port: where the contest was maintained with the greatest  obstinacy. For the forces were divided, and the fight maintained in several  streets at once, and the enemy endeavored to seize with a strong party the  ships of war; of which fifty had been sent to Pompey's assistance, but after  the battle in Thessaly, had returned home. They were all of either three or  five banks of oars, well equipped and appointed with every necessary for a  voyage. Besides these, there were twenty-two vessels with decks, which  were usually kept at Alexandria, to guard the port. If they made themselves  masters of these, Caesar being deprived of his fleet, they would have the  command of the port and whole sea, and could prevent him from procuring  provisions and auxiliaries. Accordingly that spirit was displayed, which  ought to be displayed when the one party saw that a speedy victory  depended on the issue, and the other their safety. But Caesar gained the day,  and set fire to all those ships, and to others which were in the docks,  because he could not guard so many places with so small a force; and  immediately he conveyed some troops to the Pharos by his ships.

This island lying over against Alexandria, forms a harbor; but on the  upper side it is connected with the town by a narrow way eight hundred  paces in length, made by piles sunk in the sea, and by a bridge. In this island  some of the Egyptians have houses, and a village as large as a town; and  whatever ships from any quarter, either through mistaking the channel, or by  the storm, have been driven from their course upon the coast, they  constantly plunder like pirates. And without the consent of those who are  masters of the Pharos, no vessels can enter the harbor, on account of its  narrowness. Caesar being greatly alarmed on this account, while the enemy  were engaged in battle, landed his soldiers, seized the Pharos, and placed a  garrison in it. By this means he gained this point, that he could be supplied  without danger with corn, and auxiliaries; for he sent to all the neighboring  countries, to demand supplies. In other parts of the town, they fought so  obstinately, that they quitted the field with equal advantage, and neither  were beaten (in consequence of the narrowness of the passes); and a few  being killed on both sides, Caesar secured the most necessary posts, and  fortified them in the night. In this quarter of the town was a wing of the  king's palace, in which Caesar was lodged on his first arrival, and a theater  adjoining the house which served as for citadel, and commanded an avenue  to the ports and other docks. These fortifications he increased during the  succeeding days, that he might have them before him as a rampart, and not  be obliged to fight against his will. In the mean time Ptolemy's younger  daughter, hoping the throne would become vacant, made her escape from  the palace to Achillas, and assisted him in prosecuting the war. But they  soon quarreled about the command, which circumstance enlarged the  presents to the soldiers, for each endeavored by great sacrifices to secure  their affection. While the enemy was thus employed, Pothinus, tutor to the  young king, and regent of the kingdom, who was in Caesar's part of the  town, sent messengers to Achillas, and encouraged him not to desist from  his enterprise, nor to despair of success; but his messengers being  discovered and apprehended, he was put to death by Caesar. Such was the  commencement of the Alexandrian war.
