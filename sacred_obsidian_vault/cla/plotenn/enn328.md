 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 9</h4>
 
 <p>9. But Zeus- ordering all, governor, guardian and disposer,
 possessor for ever of the kingly soul and the kingly intellect,
 bringing all into being by his providence, and presiding over all
 things as they come, administering all under plan and system,
 unfolding the periods of the kosmos, many of which stand already
 accomplished- would it not seem inevitable that, in this
 multiplicity of concern, Zeus should have memory of all the periods,
 their number and their differing qualities? Contriving the future,
 co-ordinating, calculating for what is to be, must he not surely be
 the chief of all in remembering, as he is chief in producing?
 
 </p><p>Even this matter of Zeus' memory of the kosmic periods is
 difficult; it is a question of their being numbered, and of his
 knowledge of their number. A determined number would mean 
 that the All
 had a beginning in time [which is not so]; if the periods are
 unlimited, Zeus cannot know the number of his works.
 
 </p><p>The answer is that he will know all to be one thing existing in
 virtue of one life for ever: it is in this sense that the All is
 unlimited, and thus Zeus' knowledge of it will not be as of
 something seen from outside but as of something embraced in true
 knowledge, for this unlimited thing is an eternal indweller within
 himself- or, to be more accurate, eternally follows upon him- and is
 seen by an indwelling knowledge; Zeus knows his own unlimited life,
 and, in that knowledge knows the activity that flows from him to the
 kosmos; but he knows it in its unity not in its process.
