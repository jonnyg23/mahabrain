 <p>15. Now the objects attracting the sun-rays to themselves-
 illuminated by a fire of the sense-order- are necessarily of the
 sense-order; there is perceptibility because there has been 
 a union of
 things at once external to each other and continuous, contiguous, in
 direct contact, two extremes in one line. But the Reason-Principle
 operating upon Matter is external to it only in a very different
 mode and sense: exteriority in this case is amply supplied by
 contrariety of essence and can dispense with any opposite ends [any
 question of lineal position]; or, rather, the difference is one that
 actually debars any local extremity; sheer incongruity of 
 essence, the
 utter failure in relationship, inhibits admixture [between Matter
 and any form of Being].
 
 </p><p>The reason, then, of the immutability of Matter is that the
 entrant principle neither possesses it nor is possessed by it.
 Consider, as an example, the mode in which an opinion or
 representation is present in the mind; there is no admixture; the
 notion that came goes in its time, still integrally itself alone,
 taking nothing with it, leaving nothing after it, because it has not
 been blended with the mind; there is no "outside" in the sense of
 contact broken, and the distinction between base and entrant 
 is patent
 not to the senses but to the reason.
 
 </p><p>In that example, no doubt, the mental representation- though it
 seems to have a wide and unchecked control- is an image, while the
 Soul [Mind] is in its nature not an image [but a Reality]: none the
 less the Soul or Mind certainly stands to the concept as 
 Matter, or in
 some analogous relation. The representation, however, does not cover
 the Mind over; on the contrary it is often expelled by some activity
 there; however urgently it presses in, it never effects such an
 obliteration as to be taken for the Soul; it is confronted there by
 indwelling powers, by Reason-Principles, which repel all such attack.
 
 </p><p>Matter- feebler far than the Soul for any exercise of power, and
 possessing no phase of the Authentic Existents, not even in 
 possession
 of its own falsity- lacks the very means of manifesting itself,
 utter void as it is; it becomes the means by which other things
 appear, but it cannot announce its own presence. Penetrating thought
 may arrive at it, discriminating it from Authentic 
 Existence; then, it
 is discerned as something abandoned by all that really is, 
 by even the
 dimmest semblants of being, as a thing dragged towards every 
 shape and
 property and appearing to follow- yet in fact not even following.
