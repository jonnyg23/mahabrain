 <p>8. Now: given a light of this degree, remaining in the upper
 sphere at its appointed station, pure light in purest place, 
 what mode
 of outflow from it can be conceived possible?
 
 </p><p>Such a Kind is not so constituted as to flow downwards of its
 own accord; and there exists in those regions no power to force it
 down. Again, body in contact with soul must always be very different
 from body left to itself; the bodily substance of the 
 heavens has that
 contact and will show that difference.
 
 </p><p>Besides, the corporeal substance nearest to the heavens would be
 air or fire: air has no destructive quality; fire would be powerless
 there since it could not enter into effective contact: in its very
 rush it would change before its attack could be felt; and, apart
 from that, it is of the lesser order, no match for what it would be
 opposing in those higher regions.
 
 </p><p>Again, fire acts by imparting heat: now it cannot be the 
 source of
 heat to what is already hot by nature; and anything it is to destroy
 must as a first condition be heated by it, must be brought to a
 pitch of heat fatal to the nature concerned.
 
 </p><p>In sum, then, no outside body is necessary to the heavens to
 ensure their permanence- or to produce their circular movement, for
 it has never been shown that their natural path would be the straight
 line; on the contrary the heavens, by their nature, will either be
 motionless or move by circle; all other movement indicates outside
 compulsion. We cannot think, therefore, that the heavenly bodies
 stand in need of replenishment; we must not argue from earthly
 frames to those of the celestial system whose sustaining soul is not
 the same, whose space is not the same, whose conditions are not
 those which make restoration necessary in this realm of composite
 bodies always in flux: we must recognise that the changes that take
 place in bodies here represent a slipping-away from the being
 [a phenomenon not incident to the celestial sphere] and take place
 at the dictate of a Principle not dwelling in the higher regions, one
 not powerful enough to ensure the permanence of the existences in
 which it is exhibited, one which in its coming into being and in
 its generative act is but an imitation of an antecedent Kind, and,
 as we have shown, cannot at every point possess the unchangeable
 identity of the Intellectual Realm.
