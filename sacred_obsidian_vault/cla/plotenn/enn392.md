 <p>9. (14) Over against that body, stands the principle which is
 self-caused, which is all that neither enters into being nor passes
 away, the principle whose dissolution would mean the end of 
 all things
 never to be restored if once this had ceased to be, the sustaining
 principle of things individually, and of this kosmos, which owes its
 maintenance and its ordered system to the soul.
 
 </p><p>This is the starting point of motion and becomes the leader and
 provider of motion to all else: it moves by its own quality, 
 and every
 living material form owes life to this principle, which of itself
 lives in a life that, being essentially innate, can never fail.
 
 </p><p>Not all things can have a life merely at second hand; this would
 give an infinite series: there must be some nature which, having
 life primally, shall be of necessity indestructible, immortal, as
 the source of life to all else that lives. This is the point at
 which all that is divine and blessed must be situated, living and
 having being of itself, possessing primal being and primal life, and
 in its own essence rejecting all change, neither coming to be nor
 passing away.
 
 </p><p>Whence could such a being arise or into what could it disappear:
 the very word, strictly used, means that the thing is perdurable.
 Similarly white, the colour, cannot be now white and now not 
 white: if
 this "white" were a real being it would be eternal as well as being
 white: the colour is merely white but whatsoever possesses being,
 indwelling by nature and primal, will possess also eternal duration.
 In such an entity this primal and eternal Being cannot be dead like
 stone or plank: it must be alive, and that with a life unalloyed as
 long as it remains self-gathered: when the primal Being 
 blends with an
 inferior principle, it is hampered in its relation to the 
 highest, but
 without suffering the loss of its own nature since it can always
 recover its earliest state by turning its tendency back to its own.
