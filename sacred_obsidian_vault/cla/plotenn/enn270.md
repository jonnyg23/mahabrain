 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 5</h4>
 
 <p>5. This discussion of Nature has shown us how the origin 
 of things
 is a Contemplation: we may now take the matter up to the higher
 Soul; we find that the Contemplation pursued by this, its instinct
 towards knowing and enquiring, the birth pangs set up by the 
 knowledge
 it attains, its teeming fullness, have caused it- in itself, all one
 object of Vision- to produce another Vision [that of the Kosmos]: it
 is just as a given science, complete in itself, becomes the 
 source and
 cause of what might be called a minor science in the student who
 attains to some partial knowledge of all its divisions. But the
 visible objects and the objects of intellectual contemplation of
 this later creation are dim and helpless by the side of the 
 content of
 the Soul.
 
 </p><p>The primal phase of the Soul- inhabitant of the Supreme and, by
 its participation in the Supreme, filled and illuminated- remains
 unchangeably There; but in virtue of that first 
 participation, that of
 the primal participant, a secondary phase also participates in the
 Supreme, and this secondary goes forth ceaselessly as Life streaming
 from Life; for energy runs through the Universe and there is no
 extremity at which it dwindles out. But, travel as far as it may, it
 never draws that first part of itself from the place whence the
 outgoing began: if it did, it would no longer be everywhere [its
 continuous Being would be broken and] it would be present at the
 end, only, of its course.
 
 </p><p>None the less that which goes forth cannot be equal to that
 which remains.
 
 </p><p>In sum, then:
 
 </p><p>The Soul is to extend throughout the Universe, no spot 
 void of its
 energy: but, a prior is always different from its secondary, and
 energy is a secondary, rising as it must from contemplation or act;
 act, however, is not at this stage existent since it depends upon
 contemplation: therefore the Soul, while its phases differ, must, in
 all of them, remain a contemplation and what seems to be an act done
 under contemplation must be in reality that weakened contemplation
 of which we have spoken: the engendered must respect the Kind, but
 in weaker form, dwindled in the descent.
 
 </p><p>All goes softly since nothing here demands the parade of thought
 or act upon external things: it is a Soul in vision and, by this
 vision, creating its own subsequent- this Principle [of Nature],
 itself also contemplative but in the feebler degree since it lies
 further away and cannot reproduce the quality or experiences of its
 prior- a Vision creates the Vision.
 
 </p><p>[Such creative contemplation is not inexplicable] for no limit
 exists either to contemplation or to its possible objects, and this
 explains how the Soul is universal: where can this thing fail to be,
 which is one identical thing in every Soul; Vision is not cabined
 within the bournes of magnitude.
 
 </p><p>This, of course, does not mean that the Soul is present at the
 same strength in each and every place and thing- any more 
 than that it
 is at the same strength in each of its own phases.
 
 </p><p>The Charioteer [the Leading Principle of the Soul, in 
 the Phaedrus
 Myth] gives the two horses [its two dissonant faculties] what he has
 seen and they, taking that gift, showed that they were 
 hungry for what
 made that vision; there was something lacking to them: if in their
 desire they acted, their action aimed at what they craved for- and
 that was vision, and an object of vision.
