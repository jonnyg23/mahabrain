 <p>20. But though not opposed, it is still different from Action
 and cannot belong to the same genus as activity; though if they are
 both Motion, it will so belong, on the principle that alteration
 must be regarded as qualitative motion.
 
 </p><p>Does it follow that whenever alteration proceeds from Quality,
 it will be activity and Action, the quale remaining impassive? It
 may be that if the quale remains impassive, the alteration will be
 in the category of Action; whereas if, while its energy is directed
 outwards, it also suffers- as in beating- it will cease to belong to
 that category: or perhaps there is nothing to prevent its being in
 both categories at one and the same moment.
 
 </p><p>If then an alteration be conditioned by Passivity alone, 
 as is the
 case with rubbing, on what ground is it assigned to Action 
 rather than
 to Passivity? Perhaps the Passivity arises from the fact that a
 counter-rubbing is involved. But are we, in view of this
 counter-motion, to recognize the presence of two distinct 
 motions? No:
 one only.
 
 </p><p>How then can this one motion be both Action and Passion? We must
 suppose it to be Action in proceeding from an object, and Passion in
 being directly upon another- though it remains the same motion
 throughout.
 
 </p><p>Suppose however Passion to be a different motion from Action:
 how then does its modification of the patient object change that
 patient's character without the agent being affected by the patient?
 For obviously an agent cannot be passive to the operation it
 performs upon another. Can it be that the fact of motion existing
 elsewhere creates the Passion, which was not Passion in the agent?
 
 </p><p>If the whiteness of the swan, produced by its 
 Reason-Principle, is
 given at its birth, are we to affirm Passion of the swan on its
 passing into being? If, on the contrary, the swan grows white after
 birth, and if there is a cause of that growth and the corresponding
 result, are we to say that the growth is a Passion? Or must 
 we confine
 Passion to purely qualitative change?
 
 </p><p>One thing confers beauty and another takes it: is that 
 which takes
 beauty to be regarded as patient? If then the source of beauty- tin,
 suppose- should deteriorate or actually disappear, while the
 recipient- copper- improves, are we to think of the copper as
 passive and the tin active?
 
 </p><p>Take the learner: how can he be regarded as passive, seeing that
 the Act of the agent passes into him [and becomes his Act]? How can
 the Act, necessarily a simple entity, be both Act and Passion? No
 doubt the Act is not in itself a Passion; nonetheless, the learner
 coming to possess it will be a patient by the fact of his
 appropriation of an experience from outside: he will not, of course,
 be a patient in the sense of having himself performed no Act;
 learning- like seeing- is not analogous to being struck, since it
 involves the acts of apprehension and recognition.
