 <p>5. But how explain the permanence There, while the 
 content of this
 sphere- its elements and its living things alike- are passing?
 
 </p><p>The reason is given by Plato: the celestial order is 
 from God, the
 living things of earth from the gods sprung from God; and it is law
 that the offspring of God endures.
 
 </p><p>In other words, the celestial soul- and our souls with 
 it- springs
 directly next from the Creator, while the animal life of 
 this earth is
 produced by an image which goes forth from that celestial 
 soul and may
 be said to flow downwards from it.
 
 </p><p>A soul, then, of the minor degree- reproducing, indeed, that of
 the Divine sphere but lacking in power inasmuch as it must exercise
 its creative act upon inferior stuff in an inferior region- the
 substances taken up into the fabric being of themselves repugnant to
 duration; with such an origin the living things of this realm cannot
 be of strength to last for ever; the material constituents are not
 as firmly held and controlled as if they were ruled immediately by a
 Principle of higher potency.
 
 </p><p>The heavens, on the contrary, must have persistence as a whole,
 and this entails the persistence of the parts, of the stars they
 contain: we could not imagine that whole to endure with the parts in
 flux- though, of course, we must distinguish things 
 sub-celestial from
 the heavens themselves whose region does not in fact extend so low
 as to the moon.
 
 </p><p>Our own case is different: physically we are formed by that
 [inferior] soul, given forth [not directly from God but] from the
 divine beings in the heavens and from the heavens 
 themselves; it is by
 way of that inferior soul that we are associated with the body
 [which therefore will not be persistent]; for the higher soul which
 constitutes the We is the principle not of our existence but of our
 excellence or, if also of our existence, then only in the sense
 that, when the body is already constituted, it enters, bringing with
 it some effluence from the Divine Reason in support of the existence.
