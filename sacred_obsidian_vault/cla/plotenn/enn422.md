 <p>7. We must be more explicit:
 
 </p><p>The Intellectual-Principle stands as the image of The 
 One, firstly
 because there is a certain necessity that the first should have its
 offspring, carrying onward much of its quality, in other words that
 there be something in its likeness as the sun's rays tell of the
 sun. Yet The One is not an Intellectual-Principle; how then does it
 engender an Intellectual-Principle?
 
 </p><p>Simply by the fact that in its self-quest it has vision: 
 this very
 seeing is the Intellectual-Principle. Any perception of the external
 indicates either sensation or intellection, sensation symbolized by
 a line, intellection by a circle... [corrupt passage].
 
 </p><p>Of course the divisibility belonging to the circle does not
 apply to the Intellectual-Principle; all, there too, is a unity,
 though a unity which is the potentiality of all existence.
 
 </p><p>The items of this potentiality the divine intellection 
 brings out,
 so to speak, from the unity and knows them in detail, as it 
 must if it
 is to be an intellectual principle.
 
 </p><p>It has besides a consciousness, as it were, within itself of
 this same potentiality; it knows that it can of itself beget an
 hypostasis and can determine its own Being by the virtue emanating
 from its prior; it knows that its nature is in some sense a definite
 part of the content of that First; that it thence derives 
 its essence,
 that its strength lies there and that its Being takes perfection as
 a derivative and a recipient from the First. It sees that, 
 as a member
 of the realm of division and part, it receives life and intellection
 and all else it has and is, from the undivided and partless, since
 that First is no member of existence, but can be the source of all
 on condition only of being held down by no one distinctive shape but
 remaining the undeflected unity.
 
 </p><p>[(CORRUPT)- Thus it would be the entire universe but that...]
 
 </p><p>And so the First is not a thing among the things contained by
 the Intellectual-Principle though the source of all. In 
 virtue of this
 source, things of the later order are essential beings; for from
 that fact there is determination; each has its form: what has being
 cannot be envisaged as outside of limit; the nature must be held
 fast by boundary and fixity; though to the Intellectual Beings this
 fixity is no more than determination and form, the foundations of
 their substantial existence.
 
 </p><p>A being of this quality, like the Intellectual-Principle, must
 be felt to be worthy of the all-pure: it could not derive from any
 other than from the first principle of all; as it comes into
 existence, all other beings must be simultaneously 
 engendered- all the
 beauty of the Ideas, all the Gods of the Intellectual realm. And it
 still remains pregnant with this offspring; for it has, so to speak,
 drawn all within itself again, holding them lest they fall away
 towards Matter to be "brought up in the House of Rhea" [in the realm
 of flux]. This is the meaning hidden in the Mysteries, and in the
 Myths of the gods: Kronos, as the wisest, exists before Zeus; he
 must absorb his offspring that, full within himself, he may 
 be also an
 Intellectual-Principle manifest in some product of his plenty;
 afterwards, the myth proceeds, Kronos engenders Zeus, who already
 exists as the [necessary and eternal] outcome of the plenty there;
 in other words the offspring of the Divine Intellect, perfect within
 itself, is Soul [the life-principle carrying forward the Ideas in
 the Divine Mind].
 
 </p><p>Now, even in the Divine the engendered could not be the very
 highest; it must be a lesser, an image; it will be undetermined, as
 the Divine is, but will receive determination, and, so to speak, its
 shaping idea, from the progenitor.
 
 </p><p>Yet any offspring of the Intellectual-Principle must be a
 Reason-Principle; the thought of the Divine Mind must be a 
 substantial
 existence: such then is that [Soul] which circles about the Divine
 Mind, its light, its image inseparably attached to it: on the upper
 level united with it, filled from it, enjoying it, participant in
 its nature, intellective with it, but on the lower level in contact
 with the realm beneath itself, or, rather, generating in turn an
 offspring which must lie beneath; of this lower we will treat later;
 so far we deal still with the Divine.
