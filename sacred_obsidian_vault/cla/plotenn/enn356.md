 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 37</h4>
 
 <p>37. We must not rob the universe of any factor in its being. If
 any of our theorists of to-day seek to explain the action of fire-
 or of any other such form, thought of as an agent- they will find
 themselves in difficulties unless they recognize the act to be the
 object's function in the All, and give a like explanation of other
 natural forces in common use.
 
 </p><p>We do not habitually examine or in any way question the 
 normal: we
 set to doubting and working out identifications when we are 
 confronted
 by any display of power outside everyday experience: we wonder at a
 novelty and we wonder at the customary when anyone brings 
 forward some
 single object and explains to our ignorance the efficacy 
 vested in it.
 
 </p><p>Some such power, not necessarily accompanied by reason, every
 single item possesses; for each has been brought into being and into
 shape within a universe; each in its kind has partaken of 
 soul through
 the medium of the ensouled All, as being embraced by that definitely
 constituted thing: each then is a member of an animate being 
 which can
 include nothing that is less than a full member [and therefore a
 sharer in the total of power]- though one thing is of mightier
 efficacy than another, and, especially members of the heavenly
 system than the objects of earth, since they draw upon a 
 purer nature-
 and these powers are widely productive. But productivity does not
 comport intention in what appears to be the source of the thing
 accomplished: there is efficacy, too, where there is no will: even
 attention is not necessary to the communication of power; the very
 transmission of soul may proceed without either.
 
 </p><p>A living being, we know, may spring from another without any
 intention, and as without loss so without consciousness in the
 begetter: in fact any intention the animal exercised could be a
 cause of propagation only on condition of being identical with the
 animal [i.e., the theory would make intention a propagative animal,
 not a mental act?]
 
 </p><p>And, if intention is unnecessary to the propagation of life,
 much more so is attention.
