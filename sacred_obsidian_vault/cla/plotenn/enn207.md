 <p>2. Circumstances are not sovereign over the good of 
 life, for they
 are themselves moulded by their priors and come in as members of a
 sequence. The Leading-Principle holds all the threads while the
 minor agents, the individuals, serve according to their own
 capacities, as in a war the generalissimo lays down the plan and his
 subordinates do their best to its furtherance. The Universe has been
 ordered by a Providence that may be compared to a general; he has
 considered operations, conditions and such practical needs 
 as food and
 drink, arms and engines of war; all the problem of reconciling these
 complex elements has been worked out beforehand so as to make it
 probable that the final event may be success. The entire scheme
 emerges from the general's mind with a certain plausible promise,
 though it cannot cover the enemy's operations, and there is no power
 over the disposition of the enemy's forces: but where the mighty
 general is in question whose power extends over all that is, what
 can pass unordered, what can fail to fit into the plan?
