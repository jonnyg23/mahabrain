 <p>1. What can it be that has brought the souls to forget 
 the father,
 God, and, though members of the Divine and entirely of that world,
 to ignore at once themselves and It?
 
 </p><p>The evil that has overtaken them has its source in self-will, in
 the entry into the sphere of process, and in the primal
 differentiation with the desire for self ownership. They conceived a
 pleasure in this freedom and largely indulged their own motion; thus
 they were hurried down the wrong path, and in the end, drifting
 further and further, they came to lose even the thought of their
 origin in the Divine. A child wrenched young from home and brought
 up during many years at a distance will fail in knowledge of its
 father and of itself: the souls, in the same way, no longer discern
 either the divinity or their own nature; ignorance of their rank
 brings self-depreciation; they misplace their respect, honouring
 everything more than themselves; all their awe and admiration is for
 the alien, and, clinging to this, they have broken apart, as far as
 a soul may, and they make light of what they have deserted; their
 regard for the mundane and their disregard of themselves bring about
 their utter ignoring of the divine.
 
 </p><p>Admiring pursuit of the external is a confession of inferiority;
 and nothing thus holding itself inferior to things that rise and
 perish, nothing counting itself less honourable and less 
 enduring than
 all else it admires could ever form any notion of either the 
 nature or
 the power of God.
 
 </p><p>A double discipline must be applied if human beings in this pass
 are to be reclaimed, and brought back to their origins, lifted once
 more towards the Supreme and One and First.
 
 </p><p>There is the method, which we amply exhibit elsewhere, declaring
 the dishonour of the objects which the Soul holds here in honour;
 the second teaches or recalls to the soul its race and worth; this
 latter is the leading truth, and, clearly brought out, is 
 the evidence
 of the other.
 
 </p><p>It must occupy us now for it bears closely upon our enquiry to
 which it is the natural preliminary: the seeker is soul and it must
 start from a true notion of the nature and quality by which soul may
 undertake the search; it must study itself in order to learn whether
 it has the faculty for the enquiry, the eye for the object proposed,
 whether in fact we ought to seek; for if the object is alien the
 search must be futile, while if there is relationship the solution
 of our problem is at once desirable and possible.
