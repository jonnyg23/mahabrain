 <p>30. But what of the memory of mental acts: do these also fall
 under the imaging faculty?
 
 </p><p>If every mental act is accompanied by an image we may 
 well believe
 that this image, fixed and like a picture of the thought, would
 explain how we remember the object of knowledge once entertained.
 But if there is no such necessary image, another solution must be
 sought. Perhaps memory would be the reception, into the image-taking
 faculty, of the Reason-Principle which accompanies the mental
 conception: this mental conception- an indivisible thing, 
 and one that
 never rises to the exterior of the consciousness- lies unknown
 below; the Reason-Principle the revealer, the bridge between the
 concept and the image-taking faculty exhibits the concept as in a
 mirror; the apprehension by the image-taking faculty would thus
 constitute the enduring presence of the concept, would be our memory
 of it.
 
 </p><p>This explains, also, another fact: the soul is unfailingly
 intent upon intellection; only when it acts upon this image-taking
 faculty does its intellection become a human perception:
 intellection is one thing, the perception of an intellection is
 another: we are continuously intuitive but we are not unbrokenly
 aware: the reason is that the recipient in us receives from both
 sides, absorbing not merely intellections but also sense-perceptions.
