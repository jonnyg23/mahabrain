 <p>5. And again: the multiple must be always seeking its identity,
 desiring self-accord and self-awareness: but what scope is there
 within what is an absolute unity in which to move towards 
 its identity
 or at what term may it hope for self-knowing? It holds its 
 identity in
 its very essence and is above consciousness and all intellective
 act. Intellection is not a primal either in the fact of being or in
 the value of being; it is secondary and derived: for there exists
 The Good; and this moves towards itself while its sequent is 
 moved and
 by that movement has its characteristic vision. The intellective act
 may be defined as a movement towards The Good in some being that
 aspires towards it; the effort produces the fact; the two are
 coincident; to see is to have desired to see: hence again the
 Authentic Good has no need of intellection since itself and nothing
 else is its good.
 
 </p><p>The intellective act is a movement towards the unmoved Good:
 thus the self-intellection in all save the Absolute Good is the
 working of the imaged Good within them: the intellectual principle
 recognises the likeness, sees itself as a good to itself, an 
 object of
 attraction: it grasps at that manifestation of The Good and, in
 holding that, holds self-vision: if the state of goodness is 
 constant,
 it remains constantly self-attractive and self-intellective. The
 self-intellection is not deliberate: it sees itself as an incident
 in its contemplation of The Good; for it sees itself in virtue of
 its Act; and, in all that exists, the Act is towards The Good.
