 <p>4. But there is yet another way to this knowledge:
 
 </p><p>Admiring the world of sense as we look out upon its vastness and
 beauty and the order of its eternal march, thinking of the 
 gods within
 it, seen and hidden, and the celestial spirits and all the life of
 animal and plant, let us mount to its archetype, to the yet more
 authentic sphere: there we are to contemplate all things as 
 members of
 the Intellectual- eternal in their own right, vested with a
 self-springing consciousness and life- and, presiding over all
 these, the unsoiled Intelligence and the unapproachable wisdom.
 
 </p><p>That archetypal world is the true Golden Age, age of Kronos, who
 is the Intellectual-Principle as being the offspring or exuberance
 of God. For here is contained all that is immortal: nothing here but
 is Divine Mind; all is God; this is the place of every soul. Here is
 rest unbroken: for how can that seek change, in which all is well;
 what need that reach to, which holds all within itself; what
 increase can that desire, which stands utterly achieved? All its
 content, thus, is perfect, that itself may be perfect throughout, as
 holding nothing that is less than the divine, nothing that is less
 than intellective. Its knowing is not by search but by 
 possession, its
 blessedness inherent, not acquired; for all belongs to it eternally
 and it holds the authentic Eternity imitated by Time which, circling
 round the Soul, makes towards the new thing and passes by the old.
 Soul deals with thing after thing- now Socrates; now a horse: always
 some one entity from among beings- but the Intellectual-Principle is
 all and therefore its entire content is simultaneously 
 present in that
 identity: this is pure being in eternal actuality; nowhere is there
 any future, for every then is a now; nor is there any past, for
 nothing there has ever ceased to be; everything has taken its stand
 for ever, an identity well pleased, we might say, to be as it is;
 and everything, in that entire content, is Intellectual-Principle
 and Authentic Existence; and the total of all is
 Intellectual-Principle entire and Being entire. 
 Intellectual-Principle
 by its intellective act establishes Being, which in turn, as the
 object of intellection, becomes the cause of intellection and of
 existence to the Intellectual-Principle- though, of course, there is
 another cause of intellection which is also a cause to Being, both
 rising in a source distinct from either.
 
 </p><p>Now while these two are coalescents, having their existence in
 common, and are never apart, still the unity they form is two-sided;
 there is Intellectual-Principle as against Being, the intellectual
 agent as against the object of intellection; we consider the
 intellective act and we have the Intellectual-Principle; we think of
 the object of that act and we have Being.
 
 </p><p>Such difference there must be if there is to be any
 intellection; but similarly there must also be identity [since, in
 perfect knowing, subject and object are identical.]
 
 </p><p>Thus the Primals [the first "Categories"] are seen to be:
 Intellectual-Principle; Existence; Difference; Identity: we must
 include also Motion and Rest: Motion provides for the intellectual
 act, Rest preserves identity as Difference gives at once a Knower
 and a Known, for, failing this, all is one, and silent.
 
 </p><p>So too the objects of intellection [the ideal content of the
 Divine Mind]- identical in virtue of the self-concentration of the
 principle which is their common ground- must still be distinct each
 from another; this distinction constitutes Difference.
 
 </p><p>The Intellectual Kosmos thus a manifold, Number and Quantity
 arise: Quality is the specific character of each of these ideas
 which stand as the principles from which all else derives.
