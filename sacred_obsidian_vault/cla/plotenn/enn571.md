 <p>11. Passing to Quantity and the quantum, we have to consider the
 view which identifies them with number and magnitude on the ground
 that everything quantitative is numbered among Sensible things or
 rated by the extension of its substrate: we are here, of course,
 discussing not Quantity in isolation, but that which causes 
 a piece of
 wood to be three yards long and gives the five in "five horses,"
 
 </p><p>Now we have often maintained that number and magnitude are to be
 regarded as the only true quantities, and that Space and Time have
 no right to be conceived as quantitative: Time as the measure of
 Motion should be assigned to Relation, while Space, being that which
 circumscribes Body, is also a relative and falls under the same
 category; though continuous, it is, like Motion, not included in
 Quantity.
 
 </p><p>On the other hand, why do we not find in the category of
 Quantity "great" and "small"? It is some kind of Quantity which
 gives greatness to the great; greatness is not a relative, though
 greater and smaller are relatives, since these, like 
 doubleness, imply
 an external correlative.
 
 </p><p>What is it, then, which makes a mountain small and a grain of
 millet large? Surely, in the first place, "small" is equivalent to
 "smaller." It is admitted that the term is applied only to things of
 the same kind, and from this admission we may infer that the
 mountain is "smaller" rather than "small," and that the grain of
 millet is not large in any absolute sense but large for a grain of
 millet. In other words, since the comparison is between things of
 the same kind, the natural predicate would be a comparative.
 
 </p><p>Again, why is not beauty classed as a relative? Beauty, unlike
 greatness, we regard as absolute and as a quality; "more 
 beautiful" is
 the relative. Yet even the term "beautiful" may be attached to
 something which in a given relation may appear ugly: the beauty of
 man, for example, is ugliness when compared with that of the gods;
 "the most beautiful of monkeys," we may quote, "is ugly in
 comparison with any other type." Nonetheless, a thing is beautiful
 in itself; as related to something else it is either more or less
 beautiful.
 
 </p><p>Similarly, an object is great in itself, and its 
 greatness is due,
 not to any external, but to its own participation in the Absolute
 Great.
 
 </p><p>Are we actually to eliminate the beautiful on the pretext that
 there is a more beautiful? No more then must we eliminate the great
 because of the greater: the greater can obviously have no existence
 whatever apart from the great, just as the more beautiful can have
 no existence without the beautiful.
