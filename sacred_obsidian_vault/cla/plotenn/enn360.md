 <p>41. The prayer is answered by the mere fact that part and other
 part are wrought to one tone like a musical string which, plucked at
 one end, vibrates at the other also. Often, too, the sounding of one
 string awakens what might pass for a perception in another, 
 the result
 of their being in harmony and tuned to one musical scale; now, if
 the vibration in a lyre affects another by virtue of the sympathy
 existing between them, then certainly in the All- even though it is
 constituted in contraries- there must be one melodic system; for it
 contains its unisons as well, and its entire content, even to those
 contraries, is a kinship.
 
 </p><p>Thus, too, whatever is hurtful to man- the passionate spirit,
 for example, drawn by the medium of the gall into the 
 principle seated
 in the liver- comes with no intention of hurt; it is simply as one
 transferring fire to another might innocently burn him: no doubt,
 since he actually set the other on fire he is a cause, but 
 only as the
 attacking fire itself is a cause, that is by the merely accidental
 fact that the person to whom the fire was being brought blundered in
 taking it.
