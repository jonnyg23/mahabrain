 <p>8. As then there is a Life-Form primal- which therefore is the
 Life-Form Absolute- and there is Intellectual-Principle or Being,
 Authentic Being, these, we affirm, contain all living things and all
 Number, and Absolute Justice and Beauty and all of that order; for
 we ascribe an existence of their own to Absolute Man, 
 Absolute Number,
 Absolute Justice. It remains to discover, in so far as such
 knowledge is possible, how these distinct entities come to 
 be and what
 is the manner of their being.
 
 </p><p>At the outset we must lay aside all sense-perception; by
 Intellectual-Principle we know Intellectual-Principle. We reflect
 within ourselves there is life, there is intellect, not in extension
 but as power without magnitude, issue of Authentic Being which is
 power self-existing, no vacuity but a thing most living and
 intellective- nothing more living, more intelligent, more real- and
 producing its effect by contact and in the ratio of the contact,
 closely to the close, more remotely to the remote. If Being is to be
 sought, then most be sought is Being at its intensest; so too the
 intensest of Intellect if the Intellectual act has worth; 
 and so, too,
 of Life.
 
 </p><p>First, then, we take Being as first in order; then
 Intellectual-Principle; then the Living-Form considered as
 containing all things: Intellectual-Principle, as the Act of Real
 Being, is a second.
 
 </p><p>Thus it is clear that Number cannot be dependent upon the
 Living-Form since unity and duality existed before that; nor does it
 rise in the Intellectual-Principle since before that there existed
 Real Being which is both one and numerous.
