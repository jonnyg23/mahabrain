 <p>15. The souls peering forth from the Intellectual Realm descend
 first to the heavens and there put on a body; this becomes 
 at once the
 medium by which as they reach out more and more towards magnitude
 [physical extension] they proceed to bodies progressively 
 more earthy.
 Some even plunge from heaven to the very lowest of corporeal forms;
 others pass, stage by stage, too feeble to lift towards the 
 higher the
 burden they carry, weighed downwards by their heaviness and
 forgetfulness.
 
 </p><p>As for the differences among them, these are due to variation in
 the bodies entered, or to the accidents of life, or to upbringing,
 or to inherent peculiarities of temperament, or to all these
 influences together, or to specific combinations of them.
 
 </p><p>Then again some have fallen unreservedly into the power of the
 destiny ruling here: some yielding betimes are betimes too their
 own: there are those who, while they accept what must be borne, have
 the strength of self-mastery in all that is left to their own act;
 they have given themselves to another dispensation: they live by the
 code of the aggregate of beings, the code which is woven out of the
 Reason-Principles and all the other causes ruling in the kosmos, out
 of soul-movements and out of laws springing in the Supreme; a code,
 therefore, consonant with those higher existences, founded upon
 them, linking their sequents back to them, keeping unshakeably true
 all that is capable of holding itself set towards the divine nature,
 and leading round by all appropriate means whatsoever is less
 natively apt.
 
 </p><p>In fine all diversity of condition in the lower spheres is
 determined by the descendent beings themselves.
