 <p>2.... For in any one science the reduction of the total of
 knowledge into its separate propositions does not shatter its unity,
 chipping it into unrelated fragments; in each distinct item is
 talent the entire body of the science, an integral thing in its
 highest Principle and its last detail: and similarly a man must so
 discipline himself that the first Principles of his Being 
 are also his
 completions, are totals, that all be pointed towards the loftiest
 phase of the Nature: when a man has become this unity in the best,
 he is in that other realm; for it is by this highest within himself,
 made his own, that he holds to the Supreme.
 
 </p><p>At no point did the All-Soul come into Being: it never arrived,
 for it never knew place; what happens is that body, neighbouring
 with it, participates in it: hence Plato does not place Soul in body
 but body in Soul. The others, the secondary Souls, have a point of
 departure- they come from the All-Soul- and they have a Place into
 which to descend and in which to change to and fro, a place,
 therefore, from which to ascend: but this All-Soul is for ever
 Above, resting in that Being in which it holds its existence as Soul
 and followed, as next, by the Universe or, at least, by all beneath
 the sun.
 
 </p><p>The partial Soul is illuminated by moving towards the Soul above
 it; for on that path it meets Authentic Existence. Movement towards
 the lower is towards non-Being: and this is the step it takes when
 it is set on self; for by willing towards itself it produces its
 lower, an image of itself- a non-Being- and so is wandering, as it
 were, into the void, stripping itself of its own determined form.
 And this image, this undetermined thing, is blank darkness, for it
 is utterly without reason, untouched by the Intellectual-Principle,
 far removed from Authentic Being.
 
 </p><p>As long as it remains at the mid-stage it is in its own peculiar
 region; but when, by a sort of inferior orientation, it looks
 downward, it shapes that lower image and flings itself joyfully
 thither.
