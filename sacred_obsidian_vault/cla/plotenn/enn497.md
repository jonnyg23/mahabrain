 <p>6. We take it, then, that the Intellectual-Principle is the
 authentic existences and contains them all- not as in a place but as
 possessing itself and being one thing with this its content. All are
 one there and yet are distinct: similarly the mind holds 
 many branches
 and items of knowledge simultaneously, yet none of them merged into
 any other, each acting its own part at call quite 
 independently, every
 conception coming out from the inner total and working singly. It is
 after this way, though in a closer unity, that the
 Intellectual-Principle is all Being in one total- and yet not in
 one, since each of these beings is a distinct power which, however,
 the total Intellectual-Principle includes as the species in a genus,
 as the parts in a whole. This relation may be illustrated by the
 powers in seed; all lies undistinguished in the unit, the formative
 ideas gathered as in one kernel; yet in that unit there is
 eye-principle, and there is hand-principle, each of which is
 revealed as a separate power by its distinct material product. Thus
 each of the powers in the seed is a Reason-Principle one and
 complete yet including all the parts over which it presides: there
 will be something bodily, the liquid, for example, carrying mere
 Matter; but the principle itself is Idea and nothing else, idea
 identical with the generative idea belonging to the lower soul,
 image of a higher. This power is sometimes designated as 
 Nature in the
 seed-life; its origin is in the divine; and, outgoing from its
 priors as light from fire, it converts and shapes the matter of
 things, not by push and pull and the lever work of which we hear so
 much, but by bestowal of the Ideas.
