 <p>2. We are obliged, therefore, at the start, both to establish
 the existence of this other Kind and to examine its nature and the
 mode of its Being.
 
 </p><p>Now if Matter must characteristically be undetermined, void of
 shape, while in that sphere of the Highest there can be nothing that
 lacks determination, nothing shapeless, there can be no Matter
 there. Further, if all that order is simplex, there can be no need
 of Matter, whose function is to join with some other element 
 to form a
 compound: it will be found of necessity in things of derived 
 existence
 and shifting nature- the signs which lead us to the notion of
 Matter- but it is unnecessary to the primal.
 
 </p><p>And again, where could it have come from? whence did it take its
 being? If it is derived, it has a source: if it is eternal, then the
 Primal-Principles are more numerous than we thought, the Firsts are
 a meeting-ground. Lastly, if that Matter has been entered by 
 Idea, the
 union constitutes a body; and, so, there is Body in the Supreme.
