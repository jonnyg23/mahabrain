 <p>5. As a manifold, then, this God, the Intellectual-Principle,
 exists within the Soul here, the Soul which once for all 
 stands linked
 a member of the divine, unless by a deliberate apostasy.
 
 </p><p>Bringing itself close to the divine Intellect, becoming, as it
 were, one with this, it seeks still further: What Being, now, has
 engendered this God, what is the Simplex preceding this 
 multiple; what
 the cause at once of its existence and of its existing as a
 manifold; what the source of this Number, this Quantity?
 
 </p><p>Number, Quantity, is not primal: obviously before even duality,
 there must stand the unity.
 
 </p><p>The Dyad is a secondary; deriving from unity, it finds in unity
 the determinant needed by its native indetermination: once there is
 any determination, there is Number, in the sense, of course, of the
 real [the archetypal] Number. And the soul is such a number or
 quantity. For the Primals are not masses or magnitudes; all of that
 gross order is later, real only to the sense-thought; even 
 in seed the
 effective reality is not the moist substance but the unseen- that is
 to say Number [as the determinant of individual being] and the
 Reason-Principle [of the product to be].
 
 </p><p>Thus by what we call the Number and the Dyad of that 
 higher realm,
 we mean Reason Principles and the Intellectual-Principle: but while
 the Dyad is, as regards that sphere, undetermined- 
 representing, as it
 were, the underly [or Matter] of The One- the later Number [or
 Quantity]- that which rises from the Dyad 
 [Intellectual-Principle] and
 The One- is not Matter to the later existents but is their
 forming-Idea, for all of them take shape, so to speak, from the
 ideas rising within this. The determination of the Dyad is brought
 about partly from its object- The One- and partly from itself, as is
 the case with all vision in the act of sight: intellection 
 [the Act of
 the Dyad] is vision occupied upon The One.
