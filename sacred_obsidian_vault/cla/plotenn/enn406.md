 <p>7. The Kind, then, with which we are dealing is twofold, the
 Intellectual against the sensible: better for the soul to 
 dwell in the
 Intellectual, but, given its proper nature, it is under compulsion
 to participate in the sense-realm also. There is no grievance in its
 not being, through and through, the highest; it holds mid-rank among
 the authentic existences, being of divine station but at the lowest
 extreme of the Intellectual and skirting the sense-known 
 nature; thus,
 while it communicates to this realm something of its own store, it
 absorbs in turn whenever- instead of employing in its government
 only its safeguarded phase- it plunges in an excessive zeal to the
 very midst of its chosen sphere; then it abandons its status as
 whole soul with whole soul, though even thus it is always able to
 recover itself by turning to account the experience of what it has
 seen and suffered here, learning, so, the greatness of rest in the
 Supreme, and more clearly discerning the finer things by comparison
 with what is almost their direct antithesis. Where the faculty is
 incapable of knowing without contact, the experience of evil brings
 the dearer perception of Good.
 
 </p><p>The outgoing that takes place in the Intellectual-Principle is a
 descent to its own downward ultimate: it cannot be a movement to the
 transcendent; operating necessarily outwards from itself, wherein it
 may not stay inclosed, the need and law of Nature bring it to its
 extreme term, to soul- to which it entrusts all the later stages of
 being while itself turns back on its course.
 
 </p><p>The soul's operation is similar: its next lower act is this
 universe: its immediate higher is the contemplation of the Authentic
 Existences. To individual souls such divine operation takes 
 place only
 at one of their phases and by a temporal process when from the lower
 in which they reside they turn towards the noblest; but that soul,
 which we know as the All-Soul, has never entered the lower activity,
 but, immune from evil, has the property of knowing its lower by
 inspection, while it still cleaves continuously to the beings above
 itself; thus its double task becomes possible; it takes thence and,
 since as soul it cannot escape touching this sphere, it gives hither.
