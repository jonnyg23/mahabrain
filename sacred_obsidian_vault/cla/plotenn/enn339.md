 <p>20. As with bodily pain and pleasure so with the bodily desires;
 their origin, also, must be attributed to what thus stands midway,
 to that Nature we described as the corporeal.
 
 </p><p>Body undetermined cannot be imagined to give rise to appetite
 and purpose, nor can pure soul be occupied about sweet and 
 bitter: all
 this must belong to what is specifically body but chooses to be
 something else as well, and so has acquired a restless movement
 unknown to the soul and by that acquisition is forced to aim at a
 variety of objects, to seek, as its changing states demand, sweet or
 bitter, water or warmth, with none of which it could have any
 concern if it remained untouched by life.
 
 </p><p>In the case of pleasure and pain we showed how upon distress
 follows the knowledge of it, and that the soul, seeking to alienate
 what is causing the condition, inspires a withdrawal which the
 member primarily affected has itself indicated, in its own mode, by
 its contraction. Similarly in the case of desire: there is the
 knowledge in the sensation [the sensitive phase of the soul] and in
 the next lower phase, that described as the "Nature" which 
 carries the
 imprint of the soul to the body; that Nature knows the fully formed
 desire which is the culmination of the less formed desire in body;
 sensation knows the image thence imprinted upon the Nature; and from
 the moment of the sensation the soul, which alone is competent, acts
 upon it, sometimes procuring, sometimes on the contrary resisting,
 taking control and paying heed neither to that which originated the
 desire nor to that which subsequently entertained it.
 
 </p><p>But why, thus, two phases of desire; why should not the body as
 a determined entity [the living total] be the sole desirer?
 
 </p><p>Because there are [in man] two distinct things, this Nature and
 the body, which, through it, becomes a living being: the Nature
 precedes the determined body which is its creation, made and 
 shaped by
 it; it cannot originate the desires; they must belong to the living
 body meeting the experiences of this life and seeking in its
 distress to alter its state, to substitute pleasure for pain,
 sufficiency for want: this Nature must be like a mother reading the
 wishes of a suffering child, and seeking to set it right and to
 bring it back to herself; in her search for the remedy she attaches
 herself by that very concern to the sufferer's desire and makes the
 child's experience her own.
 
 </p><p>In sum, the living body may be said to desire of its own 
 motion in
 a fore-desiring with, perhaps, purpose as well; Nature desires for,
 and because of, that living body; granting or withholding belongs to
 another again, the higher soul.
