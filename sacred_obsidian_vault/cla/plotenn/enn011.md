 <p>8. And towards the Intellectual-Principle what is our 
 relation? By
 this I mean, not that faculty in the soul which is one of the
 emanations from the Intellectual-Principle, but The
 Intellectual-Principle itself [Divine-Mind].
 
 </p><p>This also we possess as the summit of our being. And we have It
 either as common to all or as our own immediate possession: or again
 we may possess It in both degrees, that is in common, since It is
 indivisible- one, everywhere and always Its entire self- and 
 severally
 in that each personality possesses It entire in the First-Soul [i.e.
 in the Intellectual as distinguished from the lower phase of the
 Soul].
 
 </p><p>Hence we possess the Ideal-Forms also after two modes: in the
 Soul, as it were unrolled and separate; in the 
 Intellectual-Principle,
 concentrated, one.
 
 </p><p>And how do we possess the Divinity?
 
 </p><p>In that the Divinity is contained in the Intellectual-Principle
 and Authentic-Existence; and We come third in order after these two,
 for the We is constituted by a union of the supreme, the undivided
 Soul- we read- and that Soul which is divided among [living] bodies.
 For, note, we inevitably think of the Soul, though one undivided in
 the All, as being present to bodies in division: in so far as any
 bodies are Animates, the Soul has given itself to each of 
 the separate
 material masses; or rather it appears to be present in the bodies by
 the fact that it shines into them: it makes them living beings not
 by merging into body but by giving forth, without any change in
 itself, images or likenesses of itself like one face caught by many
 mirrors.
 
 </p><p>The first of these images is Sense-Perception seated in the
 Couplement; and from this downwards all the successive images are to
 be recognized as phases of the Soul in lessening succession from one
 another, until the series ends in the faculties of generation and
 growth and of all production of offspring- offspring efficient in
 its turn, in contradistinction to the engendering Soul which [has no
 direct action within matter but] produces by mere inclination
 towards what it fashions.
