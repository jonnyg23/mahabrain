 <p>30. Whether pleasure must enter into the good, so that 
 life in the
 contemplation of the divine things and especially of their source
 remains still imperfect, is a question not to be ignored in any
 enquiry into the nature of the good.
 
 </p><p>Now to found the good upon the Intellect and upon that state of
 soul or mind which springs from wisdom does not imply that the end
 or the absolute good is the conjunction [of Intellect and state]: it
 would follow merely that Intellect is the good and that we feel
 happy in possession of that good. That is one theory; another
 associates pleasure with Intellect in the sense that the 
 Good is taken
 to be some one thing founded upon both but depending upon our
 attaining or at least contemplating an Intellect so modified; this
 theory would maintain that the isolated and unrelated could be the
 good, could be an object of desire.
 
 </p><p>But how could Intellect and pleasure combine into one mutually
 complementary nature?
 
 </p><p>Bodily pleasure no one, certainly, would think capable 
 of blending
 in with Intellect; the unreasoning satisfactions of soul [or lower
 mind] are equally incompatible with it.
 
 </p><p>Every activity, state, and life, will be followed and as it were
 escorted by the over-dwelling consciousness; sometimes as these take
 their natural course they will be met by hindrance and by 
 intrusion of
 the conflicting so that the life is the less self-guided; sometimes
 the natural activity is unmixed, wholly free, and then the life
 goes brilliantly; this last state is judged the pleasantest, the
 most to be chosen; so, for lack of an accurate expression, we hear
 of "Intellect in conjunction with pleasure." But this is no more
 than metaphor, like a hundred others drawn by the poets from our
 natural likings- "Drunk with nectar," "To banquet and feast," "The
 Father smiled." No: the veritably pleasant lies away in that other
 realm, the most to be loved and sought for, not something brought
 about and changing but the very principle of all the colour and
 radiance and brightness found here. This is why we read of "Truth
 introduced into the Mixture" and of the "measuring standard 
 as a prior
 condition" and are told that the symmetry and beauty necessary to
 the Mixture come Thence into whatever has beauty; it is in this way
 that we have our share in Beauty; but in another way, also, 
 we achieve
 the truly desirable, that is by leading our selves up to what is
 best within us; this best is what is symmetry, beauty, collective
 Idea, life clear, Intellective and good.
