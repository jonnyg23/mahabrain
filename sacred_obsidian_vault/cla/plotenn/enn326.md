 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 7</h4>
 
 <p>7. Well but can they not tell themselves that yesterday, or last
 year, they moved round the earth, that they lived yesterday or at
 any given moment in their lives?
 
 </p><p>Their living is eternal, and eternity is an unchanging unity. To
 identify a yesterday or a last year in their movement would be like
 isolating the movement of one of the feet, and finding a this or a
 that and an entire series in what is a single act. The 
 movement of the
 celestial beings is one movement: it is our measuring that 
 presents us
 with many movements, and with distinct days determined by
 intervening nights: There all is one day; series has no place; no
 yesterday, no last year.
 
 </p><p>Still: the space traversed is different; there are the various
 sections of the Zodiac: why, then, should not the soul say "I have
 traversed that section and now I am in this other?" If, 
 also, it looks
 down over the concerns of men, must it not see the changes 
 that befall
 them, that they are not as they were, and, by that observation, that
 the beings and the things concerned were otherwise formerly? And
 does not that mean memory?
