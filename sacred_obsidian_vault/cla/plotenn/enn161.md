 <p>6. And, what are we to think of the new forms of being they
 introduce- their "Exiles" and "Impressions" and "Repentings"?
 
 </p><p>If all comes to states of the Soul- "Repentance" when it has
 undergone a change of purpose; "Impressions" when it contemplates
 not the Authentic Existences but their simulacra- there is nothing
 here but a jargon invented to make a case for their school: all this
 terminology is piled up only to conceal their debt to the ancient
 Greek philosophy which taught, clearly and without bombast, 
 the ascent
 from the cave and the gradual advance of souls to a truer and truer
 vision.
 
 </p><p>For, in sum, a part of their doctrine comes from Plato; all the
 novelties through which they seek to establish a philosophy of their
 own have been picked up outside of the truth.
 
 </p><p>From Plato come their punishments, their rivers of the
 underworld and the changing from body to body; as for the plurality
 they assert in the Intellectual Realm- the Authentic Existent, the
 Intellectual-Principle, the Second Creator and the Soul- all this is
 taken over from the Timaeus, where we read:
 
 </p><p>"As many Ideal-Forms as the Divine Mind beheld dwelling 
 within the
 Veritably Living Being, so many the Maker resolved should be 
 contained
 in this All."
 
 </p><p>Misunderstanding their text, they conceived one Mind passively
 including within itself all that has being, another mind, a distinct
 existence, having vision, and a third planning the Universe- though
 often they substitute Soul for this planning Mind as the creating
 Principle- and they think that this third being is the Creator
 according to Plato.
 
 </p><p>They are in fact quite outside of the truth in their
 identification of the Creator.
 
 </p><p>In every way they misrepresent Plato's theory as to the method
 of creation as in many other respects they dishonour his teaching:
 they, we are to understand, have penetrated the Intellectual Nature,
 while Plato and all those other illustrious teachers have failed.
 
 </p><p>They hope to get the credit of minute and exact identification
 by setting up a plurality of intellectual Essences; but in reality
 this multiplication lowers the Intellectual Nature to the 
 level of the
 Sense-Kind: their true course is to seek to reduce number to 
 the least
 possible in the Supreme, simply referring all things to the Second
 Hypostasis- which is all that exists as it is Primal Intellect and
 Reality and is the only thing that is good except only for the first
 Nature- and to recognize Soul as the third Principle, accounting for
 the difference among souls merely by diversity of experience and
 character. Instead of insulting those venerable teachers they should
 receive their doctrine with the respect due to the older thought and
 honour all that noble system- an immortal soul, an Intellectual and
 Intelligible Realm, the Supreme God, the Soul's need of emancipation
 from all intercourse with the body, the fact of separation from it,
 the escape from the world of process to the world of
 essential-being. These doctrines, all emphatically asserted by
 Plato, they do well to adopt: where they differ, they are at full
 liberty to speak their minds, but not to procure assent for their
 own theories by flaying and flouting the Greeks: where they have a
 divergent theory to maintain they must establish it by its 
 own merits,
 declaring their own opinions with courtesy and with philosophical
 method and stating the controverted opinion fairly; they must point
 their minds towards the truth and not hunt fame by insult, reviling
 and seeking in their own persons to replace men honoured by the fine
 intelligences of ages past.
 
 </p><p>As a matter of fact the ancient doctrine of the Divine Essences
 was far the sounder and more instructed, and must be accepted by all
 not caught in the delusions that beset humanity: it is easy also to
 identify what has been conveyed in these later times from 
 the ancients
 with incongruous novelties- how for example, where they must set up
 a contradictory doctrine, they introduce a medley of generation and
 destruction, how they cavil at the Universe, how they make the Soul
 blameable for the association with body, how they revile the
 Administrator of this All, how they ascribe to the Creator, 
 identified
 with the Soul, the character and experiences appropriate to 
 partial be
 beings.
