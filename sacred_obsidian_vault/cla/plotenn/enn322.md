 <p>3. But it leaves that conjunction; it cannot suffer that 
 unity; it
 falls in love with its own powers and possessions, and desires to
 stand apart; it leans outward so to speak: then, it appears 
 to acquire
 a memory of itself.
 
 </p><p>In this self-memory a distinction is to be made; the memory
 dealing with the Intellectual Realm upbears the soul, not to 
 fall; the
 memory of things here bears it downwards to this universe; the
 intermediate memory dealing with the heavenly sphere holds it there
 too; and, in all its memory, the thing it has in mind it is and
 grows to; for this bearing-in-mind must be either intuition [i.e.,
 knowledge with identity] or representation by image: and the imaging
 in the case of the is not a taking in of something but is vision and
 condition- so much so, that, in its very sense- sight, it is 
 the lower
 in the degree in which it penetrates the object. Since its
 possession of the total of things is not primal but 
 secondary, it does
 not become all things perfectly [in becoming identical with 
 the All in
 the Intellectual]; it is of the boundary order, situated between two
 regions, and has tendency to both.
