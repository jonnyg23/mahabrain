 <p>1. All human beings from birth onward live to the realm of sense
 more than to the Intellectual.
 
 </p><p>Forced of necessity to attend first to the material, some of
 them elect to abide by that order and, their life 
 throughout, make its
 concerns their first and their last; the sweet and the 
 bitter of sense
 are their good and evil; they feel they have done all if they live
 along pursuing the one and barring the doors to the other. And those
 of them that pretend to reasoning have adopted this as their
 philosophy; they are like the heavier birds which have incorporated
 much from the earth and are so weighted down that they 
 cannot fly high
 for all the wings Nature has given them.
 
 </p><p>Others do indeed lift themselves a little above the earth; the
 better in their soul urges them from the pleasant to the nobler, but
 they are not of power to see the highest and so, in despair of any
 surer ground, they fall back in virtue's name, upon those actions
 and options of the lower from which they sought to escape.
 
 </p><p>But there is a third order- those godlike men who, in their
 mightier power, in the keenness of their sight, have clear vision of
 the splendour above and rise to it from among the cloud and fog of
 earth and hold firmly to that other world, looking beyond all here,
 delighted in the place of reality, their native land, like a man
 returning after long wanderings to the pleasant ways of his own
 country.
