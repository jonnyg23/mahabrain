 <p>12. Think of a sound passing through the air and carrying a
 word; an ear within range catches and comprehends; and the sound and
 word will strike upon any other ear you may imagine within the
 intervening void, upon any that attends; from a great distance many
 eyes look to the one object and all take it fully; all this, because
 eye and ear exist. In the same way, what is apt for soul will
 possess itself of soul, while from the one identical presence
 another will derive something else.
 
 </p><p>Now the sound was diffused throughout the air not in sections
 but as one sound, entire at every point of that space. So with
 sight: if the air carries a shape impressed upon it this is one
 undivided whole; for, wherever there be an eye, there the shape will
 be grasped; even to such as reject this particular theory of sight,
 the facts of vision still stand as an example of participation
 determined by an identical unity.
 
 </p><p>The sound is the clearer illustration: the form conveyed is an
 entirety over all the air space, for unless the spoken word were
 entire at every point, for every ear to catch the whole alike, the
 same effect could not be made upon every listener; the sound,
 evidently, is not strung along the air, section to section. 
 Why, then,
 need we hesitate to think of soul as a thing not extended in broken
 contact, part for part, but omnipresent within the range of its
 presence, indwelling in totality at every point throughout the All?
 
 </p><p>Entered into such bodies as are apt to it, the soul is like the
 spoken sound present in the air, before that entry, like the speaker
 about to speak- though even embodied it remains at once the speaker
 and the silent.
 
 </p><p>No doubt these illustrations are imperfect, but they carry a
 serviceable similitude: the soul belongs to that other Kind, and we
 must not conceive a part of it embodied and a part intact; it is at
 once a self-enclosed unity and a principle manifested in diversity.
 
 </p><p>Further, any newcoming entity achieving soul receives 
 mysteriously
 that same principle which was equally in the previously ensouled;
 for it is not in the dispensation that a given part of soul 
 situate at
 some given point should enter here and there; what is thought of as
 entering was always a self-enclosed entire and, for all the seeming
 entry, so remains; no real entry is conceivable. If, then, the soul
 never entered and yet is now seen to be present- present without
 waiting upon the participant- clearly it is present, here 
 too, without
 breach of its self-inclusion. This can mean only that the
 participant came to soul; it lay outside the veritable reality but
 advanced towards it and so established itself in the kosmos of life.
 But this kosmos of life is a self-gathered entire, not divisible
 into constituent masses but prior to mass; in other words, the
 participation is of entire in entire. Any newcomer into that 
 kosmos of
 life will participate in it entire. Admitting, then, that this
 kosmos of life is present entire in the universe, it must be 
 similarly
 entire in each several entity; an identity numerically one, 
 it must be
 an undivided entire, omnipresent.
