 <p>7. We come to the same result by examining the sense of pain. We
 say there is pain in the finger: the trouble is doubtless in the
 finger, but our opponents must admit that the sensation of 
 the pain is
 in the centre of consciousness. The suffering member is one 
 thing, the
 sense of suffering is another: how does this happen?
 
 </p><p>By transmission, they will say: the psychic pneuma [= the
 semi-material principle of life] stationed at the finger suffers
 first; and stage by stage the trouble is passed on until at last it
 reaches the centre of consciousness.
 
 </p><p>But on this theory, there must be a sensation in the spot first
 suffering pain, and another sensation at a second point of 
 the line of
 transmission, another in the third and so on; many 
 sensations, in fact
 an unlimited series, to deal with one pain; and at the last 
 moment the
 centre of consciousness has the sensation of all these sensations
 and of its own sensation to boot. Or to be exact, these serial
 sensations will not be of the pain in the finger: the sensation next
 in succession to the suffering finger will be of pain at the joint,
 a third will tell of a pain still higher up: there will be a 
 series of
 separate pains: The centre of consciousness will not feel the pain
 seated at the finger, but only that impinging upon itself: it will
 know this alone, ignore the rest and so have no notion that 
 the finger
 is in pain.
 
 </p><p>Thus: Transmission would not give sensation of the actual
 condition at the affected spot: it is not in the nature of body that
 where one part suffers there should be knowledge in another part;
 for body is a magnitude, and the parts of every magnitude 
 are distinct
 parts; therefore we need, as the sentient, something of a 
 nature to be
 identical to itself at any and every spot; this property can belong
 only to some other form of being than body.
