 <p>4. But there is the question of the linked light that must
 relate the visual organ to its object.
 
 </p><p>Now, firstly: since the intervening air is not necessary- unless
 in the purely accidental sense that air may be necessary to 
 light- the
 light that acts as intermediate in vision will be unmodified: vision
 depends upon no modification whatever. This one intermediate, light,
 would seem to be necessary, but, unless light is corporeal, no
 intervening body is requisite: and we must remember that
 intervenient and borrowed light is essential not to seeing in
 general but to distant vision; the question whether light absolutely
 requires the presence of air we will discuss later. For the present
 one matter must occupy us:
 
 </p><p>If, in the act of vision, that linked light becomes ensouled, if
 the soul or mind permeates it and enters into union with it, as it
 does in its more inward acts such as understanding- which is what
 vision really is- then the intervening light is not a necessity: the
 process of seeing will be like that of touch; the visual faculty of
 the soul will perceive by the fact of having entered into the light;
 all that intervenes remains unaffected, serving simply as the field
 over which the vision ranges.
 
 </p><p>This brings up the question whether the sight is made active
 over its field by the sheer presence of a distance spread before it,
 or by the presence of a body of some kind within that distance.
 
 </p><p>If by the presence of such a body, then there will be vision
 though there be no intervenient; if the intervenient is the sole
 attractive agent, then we are forced to think of the visible 
 object as
 being a Kind utterly without energy, performing no act. But so
 inactive a body cannot be: touch tells us that, for it does 
 not merely
 announce that something is by and is touched: it is acted upon by
 the object so that it reports distinguishing qualities in it,
 qualities so effective that even at a distance touch itself would
 register them but for the accidental that it demands proximity.
 
 </p><p>We catch the heat of a fire just as soon as the intervening air
 does; no need to wait for it to be warmed: the denser body, in fact,
 takes in more warmth than the air has to give; in other 
 words, the air
 transmits the heat but is not the source of our warmth.
 
 </p><p>When on the one side, that of the object, there is the power in
 any degree of an outgoing act, and on the other, that of the sight,
 the capability of being acted upon, surely the object needs no
 medium through which to be effective upon what it is fully 
 equipped to
 affect: this would be needing not a help but a hindrance.
 
 </p><p>Or, again, consider the Dawn: there is no need that the light
 first flood the air and then come to us; the event is simultaneous
 to both: often, in fact, we see [in the distance] when the light is
 not as yet round our eyes at all but very far off, before, that is,
 the air has been acted upon: here we have vision without any
 modified intervenient, vision before the organ has received the
 light with which it is to be linked.
 
 </p><p>It is difficult to reconcile with this theory the fact of seeing
 stars or any fire by night.
 
 </p><p>If [as by the theory of an intervenient] the percipient mind or
 soul remains within itself and needs the light only as one might
 need a stick in the hand to touch something at a distance, then the
 perception will be a sort of tussle: the light must be conceived as
 something thrusting, something aimed at a mark, and similarly, the
 object, considered as an illuminated thing, must be conceived to be
 resistant; for this is the normal process in the case of contact by
 the agency of an intervenient.
 
 </p><p>Besides, even on this explanation, the mind must have previously
 been in contact with the object in the entire absence of 
 intervenient;
 only if that has happened could contact through an intervenient
 bring knowledge, a knowledge by way of memory, and, even more
 emphatically, by way of reasoned comparison [ending in
 identification]: but this process of memory and comparison 
 is excluded
 by the theory of first knowledge through the agency of a medium.
 
 </p><p>Finally, we may be told that the impinging light is modified by
 the thing to be seen and so becomes able to present something
 perceptible before the visual organ; but this simply brings 
 us back to
 the theory of an intervenient changed midway by the object, an
 explanation whose difficulties we have already indicated.
