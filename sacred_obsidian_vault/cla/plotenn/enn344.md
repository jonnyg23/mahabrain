 <p>25. But the organ is not the only requisite to vision or to
 perception of any kind: there must be a state of the soul 
 inclining it
 towards the sphere of sense.
 
 </p><p>Now it is the soul's character to be ever in the Intellectual
 sphere, and even though it were apt to sense-perception, this could
 not accompany that intention towards the highest; to ourselves when
 absorbed in the Intellectual, vision and the other acts of sense are
 in abeyance for the time; and, in general, any special 
 attention blurs
 every other. The desire of apprehension from part to part- a subject
 examining itself- is merely curiosity even in beings of our own
 standing, and, unless for some definite purpose, is waste of energy:
 and the desire to apprehend something external- for the sake of a
 pleasant sight- is the sign of suffering or deficiency.
 
 </p><p>Smelling, tasting flavours [and such animal perceptions] may
 perhaps be described as mere accessories, distractions of the soul,
 while seeing and hearing would belong to the sun and the other
 heavenly bodies as incidentals to their being. This would not be
 unreasonable if seeing and hearing are means by which they apply
 themselves to their function.
 
 </p><p>But if they so apply themselves, they must have memory; it is
 impossible that they should have no remembrance if they are to be
 benefactors, their service could not exist without memory.
