 <p>15. How far is it true that equality and inequality are
 characteristic of Quantity?
 
 </p><p>Triangles, it is significant, are said to be similar rather than
 equal. But we also refer to magnitudes as similar, and the accepted
 connotation of similarity does not exclude similarity or 
 dissimilarity
 in Quantity. It may, of course, be the case that the term 
 "similarity"
 has a different sense here from that understood in reference to
 Quality.
 
 </p><p>Furthermore, if we are told that equality and inequality are
 characteristic of Quantity, that is not to deny that similarity also
 may be predicated of certain quantities. If, on the contrary,
 similarity and dissimilarity are to be confined to Quality, the
 terms as applied to Quantity must, as we have said, bear a different
 meaning.
 
 </p><p>But suppose similarity to be identical in both genera; Quantity
 and Quality must then be expected to reveal other properties held in
 common.
 
 </p><p>May the truth be this: that similarity is predicable of Quantity
 only in so far as Quantity possesses [qualitative] 
 differences? But as
 a general rule differences are grouped with that of which they are
 differences, especially when the difference is a difference of that
 thing alone. If in one case the difference completes the 
 substance and
 not in another, we inevitably class it with that which it completes,
 and only consider it as independent when it is not 
 complementary: when
 we say "completes the substance," we refer not to Subtance as such
 but to the differentiated substance; the particular object is to be
 thought of as receiving an accession which is non-substantial.
 
 </p><p>We must not however fad to observe that we predicate equality of
 triangles, rectangles, and figures generally, whether plane or
 solid: this may be given as a ground for regarding equality and
 inequality as characteristic of Quantity.
 
 </p><p>It remains to enquire whether similarity and dissimilarity are
 characteristic of Quality.
 
 </p><p>We have spoken of Quality as combining with other 
 entities, Matter
 and Quantity, to form the complete Sensible Substance; this 
 Substance,
 so called, may be supposed to constitute the manifold world of
 Sense, which is not so much an essence as a quale. Thus, for the
 essence of fire we must look to the Reason-Principle; what produces
 the visible aspect is, properly speaking, a quale.
 
 </p><p>Man's essence will lie in his Reason-Principle; that which is
 perfected in the corporeal nature is a mere image of the
 Reason-Principle a quale rather than an essence.
 
 </p><p>Consider: the visible Socrates is a man, yet we give the name of
 Socrates to that likeness of him in a portrait, which 
 consists of mere
 colours, mere pigments: similarly, it is a Reason-Principle which
 constitutes Socrates, but we apply the name Socrates to the Socrates
 we see: in truth, however, the colours and shapes which make up the
 visible Socrates are but reproductions of those in the
 Reason-Principle, while this Reason-Principle itself bears a
 corresponding relation to the truest Reason-Principle of Man. But we
 need not elaborate this point.
