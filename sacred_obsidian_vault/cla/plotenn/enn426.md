 <p>11. Since there is a Soul which reasons upon the right and good-
 for reasoning is an enquiry into the rightness and goodness of this
 rather than that- there must exist some permanent Right, the source
 and foundation of this reasoning in our soul; how, else, could any
 such discussion be held? Further, since the soul's attention to
 these matters is intermittent, there must be within us an
 Intellectual-Principle acquainted with that Right not by 
 momentary act
 but in permanent possession. Similarly there must be also the
 principle of this principle, its cause, God. This Highest cannot be
 divided and allotted, must remain intangible but not bound to space,
 it may be present at many points, wheresoever there is anything
 capable of accepting one of its manifestations; thus a centre is an
 independent unity; everything within the circle has its term at the
 centre; and to the centre the radii bring each their own. Within our
 nature is such a centre by which we grasp and are linked and 
 held; and
 those of us are firmly in the Supreme whose collective tendency is
 There.
