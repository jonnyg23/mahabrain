 <p>15. The "category of Action":
 
 </p><p>The quantum has been regarded as a single genus on the 
 ground that
 Quantity and Number are attributes of Substance and posterior to it;
 the quale has been regarded as another genus because Quality is an
 attribute of Substance: on the same principle it is maintained that
 since activity is an attribute of Substance, Action constitutes yet
 another genus.
 
 </p><p>Does then the action constitute the genus, or the activity from
 which the action springs, in the same way as Quality is the 
 genus from
 which the quale is derived? Perhaps activity, action and agent
 should all be embraced under a single head? But, on the one hand,
 the action- unlike activity- tends to comport the agent; and on the
 other, it signifies being in some activity and therefore
 Being-in-Act [actual as distinct from potential Being]. Consequently
 the category will be one of Act rather than of Action.
 
 </p><p>Act moreover incontestably manifests itself in Substance, as was
 found to be the case with Quality: it is connected with Substance as
 being a form of motion. But Motion is a distinct genus: for, seeing
 that Quality is a distinct attribute of Substance, and Quality a
 distinct attribute, and Relative takes its being from the relation
 of one substance to another, there can be no reason why Motion, also
 an attribute of Substance, should not also constitute a distinct
 genus.
