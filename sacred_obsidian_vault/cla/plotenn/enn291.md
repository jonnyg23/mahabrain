 <p>5. But what place is left for the particular souls, 
 yours and mine
 and another's?
 
 </p><p>May we suppose the Soul to be appropriated on the lower ranges
 to some individual, but to belong on the higher to that other sphere?
 
 </p><p>At this there would be a Socrates as long as Socrates' soul
 remained in body; but Socrates ceases to exist, precisely on
 attainment of the highest.
 
 </p><p>Now nothing of Real Being is ever annulled.
 
 </p><p>In the Supreme, the Intellectual-Principles are not annulled,
 for in their differentiation there is no bodily partition, no
 passing of each separate phase into a distinct unity; every 
 such phase
 remains in full possession of that identical being. It is exactly so
 with the souls.
 
 </p><p>By their succession they are linked to the several
 Intellectual-Principles, for they are the expression, the Logos, of
 the Intellectual-Principles, of which they are the unfolding;
 brevity has opened out to multiplicity; by that point of their being
 which least belongs to the partial order, they are attached each to
 its own Intellectual original: they have already chosen the way of
 division; but to the extreme they cannot go; thus they keep, at
 once, identification and difference; each soul is permanently a
 unity [a self] and yet all are, in their total, one being.
 
 </p><p>Thus the gist of the matter is established: one soul the 
 source of
 all; those others, as a many founded in that one, are, on the
 analogy of the Intellectual-Principle, at once divided and
 undivided; that Soul which abides in the Supreme is the one 
 expression
 or Logos of the Intellectual-Principle, and from it spring other
 Reason-Principles, partial but immaterial, exactly as in the
 differentiation of the Supreme.
