 <p>15. But there is a difficulty affecting this entire settlement:
 Eternity is characteristic of the Intellectual-Principle, time of
 the soul- for we hold that time has its substantial being in the
 activity of the soul, and springs from soul- and, since time is a
 thing of division and comports a past, it would seem that 
 the activity
 producing it must also be a thing of division, and that its
 attention to that past must imply that even the All-Soul has memory?
 We repeat, identity belongs to the eternal, time must be the 
 medium of
 diversity; otherwise there is nothing to distinguish them,
 especially since we deny that the activities of the soul can
 themselves experience change.
 
 </p><p>Can we escape by the theory that, while human souls- receptive
 of change, even to the change of imperfection and lack- are in time,
 yet the Soul of the All, as the author of time, is itself timeless?
 But if it is not in time, what causes it to engender time rather
 than eternity?
 
 </p><p>The answer must be that the realm it engenders is not that of
 eternal things but a realm of things enveloped in time: it is just
 as the souls [under, or included in, the All-Soul] are not in time,
 but some of their experiences and productions are. For a soul is
 eternal, and is before time; and what is in time is of a lower order
 than time itself: time is folded around what is in time 
 exactly as- we
 read- it is folded about what is in place and in number.
