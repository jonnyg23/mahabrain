 <p>2. But the Universe outside; how is it aligned towards the Good?
 
 </p><p>The soulless by direction toward Soul: Soul towards the Good
 itself, through the Intellectual-Principle.
 
 </p><p>Everything has something of the Good, by virtue of possessing a
 certain degree of unity and a certain degree of Existence and by
 participation in Ideal-Form: to the extent of the Unity, Being, and
 Form which are present, there is a sharing in an image, for the
 Unity and Existence in which there is participation are no more than
 images of the Ideal-Form.
 
 </p><p>With Soul it is different; the First-Soul, that which 
 follows upon
 the Intellectual-Principle, possesses a life nearer to the Verity
 and through that Principle is of the nature of good; it will
 actually possess the Good if it orientate itself towards the
 Intellectual-Principle, since this follows immediately upon the Good.
 
 </p><p>In sum, then, life is the Good to the living, and the
 Intellectual-Principle to what is intellective; so that 
 where there is
 life with intellection there is a double contact with the Good.
