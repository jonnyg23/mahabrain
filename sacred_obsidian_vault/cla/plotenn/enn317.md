 <p>31. But if each of the two phases of the soul, as we have said,
 possesses memory, and memory is vested in the imaging faculty, there
 must be two such faculties. Now that is all very well as long as the
 two souls stand apart; but, when they are at one in us, what becomes
 of the two faculties, and in which of them is the imaging faculty
 vested?
 
 </p><p>If each soul has its own imaging faculty the images must in all
 cases be duplicated, since we cannot think that one faculty 
 deals only
 with intellectual objects, and the other with objects of sense, a
 distinction which inevitably implies the co-existence in man of two
 life-principles utterly unrelated.
 
 </p><p>And if both orders of image act upon both orders of soul, what
 difference is there in the souls; and how does the fact escape our
 knowledge?
 
 </p><p>The answer is that, when the two souls chime each with each, the
 two imaging faculties no longer stand apart; the union is 
 dominated by
 the more powerful of the faculties of the soul, and thus the image
 perceived is as one: the less powerful is like a shadow 
 attending upon
 the dominant, like a minor light merging into a greater: 
 when they are
 in conflict, in discord, the minor is distinctly apart, a
 self-standing thing- though its isolation is not perceived, for the
 simple reason that the separate being of the two souls escapes
 observation.
 
 </p><p>The two have run into a unity in which, yet, one is the loftier:
 this loftier knows all; when it breaks from the union, it 
 retains some
 of the experiences of its companion, but dismisses others; thus we
 accept the talk of our less valued associates, but, on a change of
 company, we remember little from the first set and more from those
 in whom we recognize a higher quality.
