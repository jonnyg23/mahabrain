 <h4 align="CENTER">Section 6</h4>
 
 <p>6. As for the disregard of desert- the good afflicted, the
 unworthy thriving- it is a sound explanation no doubt that 
 to the good
 nothing is evil and to the evil nothing can be good: still the
 question remains why should what essentially offends our nature fall
 to the good while the wicked enjoy all it demands? How can such an
 allotment be approved?
 
 </p><p>No doubt since pleasant conditions add nothing to true happiness
 and the unpleasant do not lessen the evil in the wicked, the
 conditions matter little: as well complain that a good man happens
 to be ugly and a bad man handsome.
 
 </p><p>Still, under such a dispensation, there would surely be a
 propriety, a reasonableness, a regard to merit which, as things are,
 do not appear, though this would certainly be in keeping with the
 noblest Providence: even though external conditions do not affect a
 man's hold upon good or evil, none the less it would seem utterly
 unfitting that the bad should be the masters, be sovereign in the
 state, while honourable men are slaves: a wicked ruler may commit
 the most lawless acts; and in war the worst men have a free hand and
 perpetrate every kind of crime against their prisoners.
 
 </p><p>We are forced to ask how such things can be, under a Providence.
 Certainly a maker must consider his work as a whole, but 
 none the less
 he should see to the due ordering of all the parts, especially when
 these parts have Soul, that is, are Living and Reasoning Beings: the
 Providence must reach to all the details; its functioning 
 must consist
 in neglecting no point.
 
 </p><p>Holding, therefore, as we do, despite all, that the Universe
 lies under an Intellectual Principle whose power has touched every
 existent, we cannot be absolved from the attempt to show in what way
 the detail of this sphere is just.
