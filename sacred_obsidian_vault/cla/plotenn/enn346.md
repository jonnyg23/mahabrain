 <p>27. If the earth transmits the generative soul to growing
 things- or retains it while allowing a vestige of it to 
 constitute the
 vegetal principle in them- at once the earth is ensouled, as 
 our flesh
 is, and any generative power possessed by the plant world is of its
 bestowing: this phase of the soul is immanent in the body of the
 growing thing, and transmits to it that better element by which it
 differs from the broken off part no longer a thing of growth but a
 mere lump of material.
 
 </p><p>But does the entire body of the earth similarly receive anything
 from the soul?
 
 </p><p>Yes: for we must recognize that earthly material broken off from
 the main body differs from the same remaining continuously attached;
 thus stones increase as long as they are embedded, and, from the
 moment they are separated, stop at the size attained.
 
 </p><p>We must conclude, then, that every part and member of the earth
 carries its vestige of this principle of growth, an under-phase of
 that entire principle which belongs not to this or that member but
 to the earth as a whole: next in order is the nature [the 
 soul-phase],
 concerned with sensation, this not interfused [like the vegetal
 principle] but in contact from above: then the higher soul and the
 Intellectual-Principle, constituting together the being known as
 Hestia [Earth-Mind] and Demeter [Earth-Soul]- a nomenclature
 indicating the human intuition of these truths, asserted in the
 attribution of a divine name and nature.
