 <p>13. The characteristic activities are not hindered by 
 outer events
 but merely adapt themselves, remaining always fine, and perhaps all
 the finer for dealing with the actual. When he has to handle
 particular cases and things, he may not be able to put his 
 vision into
 act without searching and thinking, but the one greatest principle
 is ever present to him, like a part of his being- most of 
 all present,
 should he be even a victim in the much-talked-of Bull of Phalaris.
 No doubt, despite all that has been said, it is idle to pretend that
 this is an agreeable lodging; but what cries in the Bull is the
 thing that feels the torture; in the Sage there is something else as
 well, The Self-Gathered which, as long as it holds itself by main
 force within itself, can never be robbed of the vision of the
 All-Good.
