 <p>2. Now the reasoning faculty which undertakes this problem is
 not a unity but a thing of parts; it brings the bodily 
 nature into the
 enquiry, borrowing its principles from the corporeal: thus it thinks
 of the Essential Existence as corporeal and as a thing of parts; it
 baulks at the unity because it does not start from the appropriate
 principles. We, however, must be careful to bring the appropriately
 convincing principles to the discussion of the Unity, of perfect
 Being: we must hold to the Intellectual principles which alone apply
 to the Intellectual Order and to Real Being.
 
 </p><p>On the one hand there is the unstable, exposed to all sorts of
 change, distributed in place, not so much Being as Becoming: on the
 other, there is that which exists eternally, not divided, subject to
 no change of state, neither coming into being nor falling 
 from it, set
 in no region or place or support, emerging from nowhere, 
 entering into
 nothing, fast within itself.
 
 </p><p>In dealing with that lower order we would reason from its own
 nature and the characteristics it exhibits; thus, on a plausible
 foundation, we achieve plausible results by a plausible system of
 deduction: similarly, in dealing with the Intellectual, the only way
 is to grasp the nature of the essence concerned and so lay the sure
 foundations of the argument, not forgetfully straying over into that
 other order but basing our treatment on what is essential to the
 Nature with which we deal.
 
 </p><p>In every entity the essential nature is the governing principle
 and, as we are told, a sound definition brings to light many even of
 the concomitants: where the essential nature is the entire being, we
 must be all the more careful to keep to that, to look to that, to
 refer all to that.
