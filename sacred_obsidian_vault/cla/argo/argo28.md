But Cypris again spoke, vexed at heart: "To others my sorrows are a jest; nor ought I to tell them to all; I know them too well myself.  But now, since this pleases you both, I will make the attempt and coax him, and he will not say me nay."

And Cypris went on her way through the glens of Olympus to find her boy.  And she found him apart, in the blooming orchard of Zeus, not alone, but with him Ganymedes, whom once Zeus had set to dwell among the immortal gods, being enamoured of his beauty.  And they were playing for golden dice, as boys in one house are wont to do.  And already greedy Eros was holding the palm of his left hand quite full of them under his breast, standing upright; and on the bloom of his cheeks a sweet blush was glowing.  But the other sat crouching hard by, silent and downcast, and he had two dice left which he threw one after the other, and was angered by the loud laughter of Eros.  And lo, losing them straightway with the former, he went off empty handed, helpless, and noticed not the approach of Cypris.  And she stood before her boy, and laying her hand on his lips, addressed him:

Come, be ready to perform for me the task I will tell thee of, and I will give thee Zeus' all-beauteous plaything -- the one which his dear nurse Adrasteia made for him, while he still lived a child, with childish ways, in the Idaean cave -- a well-rounded ball; no better toy wilt thou get from the hands of Hephaestus.  All of gold are its zones, and round each double seams run in a circle; but the stitches are hidden, and a dark blue spiral overlays them all.  But if thou shouldst cast it with thy hands, lo, like a star, it sends a flaming track through the sky.  This I will give thee; and do thou strike with thy shaft and charm the daughter of Aeetes with love for Jason; and let there be no loitering.  For then my thanks would be the slighter."

And straightway with golden baldric he slung round him his quiver from where it leant against a tree-trunk, and took up his curved bow.  And he fared forth through the fruitful orchard of the palace of Zeus.  Then he passed through the gates of Olympus high in air; hence is a downward path from heaven; and the twin poles rear aloft steep mountain tops the highest crests of earth, where the risen sun grows ruddy with his first beams.  And beneath him there appeared now the life-giving earth and cities of men and sacred streams of rivers, and now in turn mountain peaks and the ocean all around, as he swept through the vast expanse of air.

And Aeson's son himself was speaking among them; and they were listening silently in their places sitting row upon row: "My friends, what pleases myself that will I say out; it is for you to bring about its fulfilment.  For in common is our task, and common to all alike is the right of speech; and he who in silence withholds his thought and his counsel, let him know that it is he alone that bereaves this band of its home-return.  Do ye others rest here in the ship quietly with your arms; but I will go to the palace of Aeetes, taking with me the sons of Phrixus and two comrades as well.  And when I meet him I will first make trial with words to see if he will be willing to give up the golden fleece for friendship's sake or not, but trusting to his might will set at nought our quest.  For so, learning his frowardness first from himself, we will consider whether we shall meet him in battle, or some other plan shall avail us, if we refrain from the war-cry.  And let us not merely by force, before putting words to the test, deprive him of his own possession.  But first it is better to go to him and win his favour by speech.  Oftentimes, I ween, does speech accomplish at need what prowess could hardly catty through, smoothing the path in manner befitting.  And he once welcomed noble Phrixus, a fugitive from his stepmother's wiles and the sacrifice prepared by his father.  For all men everywhere, even the most shameless, reverence the ordinance of Zeus, god of strangers, and regard it."

And then he summoned to go with him the sons of Phrixus, and Telamon and Augeias; and himself took Hermes' wand; and at once they passed forth from the ship beyond the reeds and the water to dry land, towards the rising ground of the plain. The plain, I wis, is called Circe's; and here in line grow many willows and osiers, on whose topmost branches hang corpses bound with cords.  For even now it is an abomination with the Colchians to burn dead men with fire; nor is it lawful to place them in the  earth and raise a mound above, but to wrap them in untanned oxhides and suspend them from trees far from the city.  And so earth has an equal portion with air, seeing that they bury the women; for that is the custom of their land.
