And as Apollo goes forth from some fragrant shrine to divine Delos or Claros or Pytho or to broad Lyeia near the stream of Xanthus, in such beauty moved Jason through the throng of people; and a cry arose as they shouted together.  And there met him aged Iphias, priestess of Artemis guardian of the city, and kissed his right hand, but she had not strength to say a word, for all her eagerness, as the crowd rushed on, but she was left there by the wayside, as the old are left by the young, and he passed on and was gone afar.

And he stood at the entering in, and they were gathered to meet him.  And they perceived Aeastus and Argus coming from the city, and they marvelled when they saw them hasting with all speed, despite the will of Pelias.  The one, Argus, son of Arestor, had cast round his shoulders the hide of a bull reaching to his feet, with the black hair upon it, the other, a fair mantle of double fold, which his sister Pelopeia had given him.  Still Jason forebore from asking them about each point but bade all be seated for an assembly.  And there, upon the folded sails and the mast as it lay on the ground, they all took their seats in order.  And among them with goodwill spake Aeson's son:

First of all, by the command of Argus, they strongly girded the ship with a rope well twisted within,  stretching it tight on each side, in order that the planks might be well compacted by the bolts and might withstand the opposing force of the surge.  And they quickly dug a trench as wide as the space the ship covered, and at the prow as far into the sea as it would run when drawn down by their hands.  And they ever dug deeper in front of the stem, and in the furrow laid polished rollers; and inclined the ship down upon the first rollers, that so she might glide and be borne on by them.  And above, on both sides, reversing the oars, they fastened them round the thole- pins, so as to project a cubit's space.  And the heroes themselves stood on both sides at the oars in a row, and pushed forward with chest and hand at once.  And then Tiphys leapt on board to urge the youths to push at the right moment; and calling on them he shouted loudly; and they at once, leaning with all their strength, with one push started the ship from her place, and strained with their feet, forcing her onward; and Pelian Argo followed swiftly; and they on each side shouted as they rushed on.  And then the rollers groaned under the sturdy keel as they were chafed, and round them rose up a dark smoke owing to the weight, and she glided into the sea; but the heroes stood there and kept dragging her back as she sped onward.  And round the thole-pins they fitted the oars, and in the ship they placed the mast and the well-made sails and the stores.
