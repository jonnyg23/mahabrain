 <p>FROM that time   on, as I could no longer endure the life in the whale and was discontented   with the delay, I sought a way of escape. First we determined to dig through   the right side and make off, and we made a beginning and tried to cut   through. But when we had advanced some five furlongs without getting   anywhere, we left off digging and decided to set the forest afire, thinking   that in this way the whale could be killed, and in that case our escape would   be easy. So we began at the tail end and set it afire. For seven days and   seven nights he was unaffected by the burning, but on the eighth and ninth we   gathered that he was in a bad way. For instance, he yawned less frequently,   and whenever he did yawn he closed his mouth quickly. On the tenth and   eleventh day mortification at last set in and he was noisome. On the twelfth   we perceived just in time that if someone did not shore his jaws open when he   yawned, so that he could not close them again, we stood a chance of being   shut up in the dead whale and dying there ourselves. At the last moment,   then, we propped the mouth open with great beams and made our boat ready,   putting aboard</p>

 <p>all the water   we could and the other provisions. Our sailing-master was to be Scintharus.</p>   
 <p>On the next day   the whale was dead at last. We dragged the boat up, took her through the   gaps, made her fast to the teeth and lowered her slowly into the sea.   Climbing on the back and sacrificing to Poseidon there by the trophy, we   camped for three days, as it was calm. On the fourth day we sailed off, and   in so doing met and grounded on many of the dead from the sea-fight, and   measured their bodies with amazement. For some days we sailed with a moderate   breeze, and then a strong norther blew up and brought on great cold. The   entire sea was frozen by it, not just on the surface but to a depth of fully   six fathoms, so that we could leave the boast and run on the ice. The wind   held and we could not stand it, so we devised an odd remedy--the proposer of   the idea was Scintharus. We dug a very large cave in the water and stopped in   it for thirty days, keeping a fire burning and eating the fish that we found   in digging. When our provisions at last failed, we came out, hauled up the   boat, which had frozen in, spread our canvas and slid, gliding on the ice smoothly   and easily, just as if we were sailing. On the fifth day it was warm again,   the ice broke up and everything turned to water once more.</p>

 <p>ran in at a   small desert island, where we got water--which had failed by this time--and   shot two wild bulls, and then sailed away. These bulls did not have their   horns on their head but under their eyes, as Momus wanted. <a name="fr_27"></a><a href="#fn_27"><font size="1">1</font></a> Not long   afterwards we entered a sea of milk, not of water, and in it a white island,   full of grapevines, came in sight. The island was a great solid cheese, as we   afterwards learned by tasting it. It was twenty-five furlongs in   circumference. The vines were full of grapes, but the liquid which we   squeezed from them and drank was milk instead of wine. A temple had been   constructed in the middle of the island in honour of Galatea the Nereid, as   its inscription indicated. All the time that we stopped in the island the   earth was our bread and meat and the milk from the grapes our drink. The ruler   of that region was said to be Tyro, daughter of Salmoneus, who after   departure from home received this guerdon from Poseidon. <a name="fr_28"></a><a href="#fn_28"><font size="1">2</font></a></p>   
 <p>After stopping   five days on the island we started out on the sixth, with a bit of breeze   propelling us over a rippling sea, On the eighth day, by which time we were   no longer sailing through the milk but in briny blue water, we came in sight   of many men running over the sea, like us in every way, both in shape and in   size, except only their feet, which were of cork: that is why they were   called Corkfeet, if I</p>

 <p>am not mistaken.   We were amazed to see that they did not go under, but stayed on the top of   the waves and went about fearlessly. Some of them came up and greeted us in   the Greek language; they said that they were on their way to Cork, their   native city. For some distance they travelled with us, running alongside, and   then they turned off and went their way, wishing us luck on our voyage.</p>   
 <p>In a little   while many islands came in sight. Near us, to port, was Cork, where the men   were going, a city built on a great round cork. At a distance and more to   starboard were five islands, very large and high, from which much fire was   blazing up. Dead ahead was one that was flat and low-lying, not less than   five hundred furlongs off. When at length we were near it, a wonderful breeze   blew about us, sweet and fragrant, like the one that, on the word of the   historian Herodotus, <a name="fr_29"></a><a href="#fn_29"><font size="1">1</font></a> breathes perfume from Araby the blest. The   sweetness that met us was as if it came from roses and narcissi and hyacinths   and lilies and violets, from myrrh and laurel and vines in bloom. Delighted   with the fragrance and cherishing high hopes after our long toils, we   gradually drew near to the island at last. Then we saw many harbours all   about it, large and unfretted by beating waves; transparent rivers emptying   softly into the sea; meads, too, and woods and songbirds, some of them   singing on the shore and many in the branches. A rare, pure atmosphere   enfolded the place, and sweet breezes with their</p>

 <p>blowing stirred   the woods gently, so that from the moving branches came a whisper of   delightful, unbroken music, like the fluting of Pandean pipes in desert places.   Moreover, a confused sound could be heard incessantly, which was not noisy   but resembled that made at a drinking-party, when some are playing, others   singing and others beating time to the flute or the lyre. Enchanted with all   this, we put in, anchored our boat and landed, leaving Scintharus and two of   my comrades on board. Advancing through a flowery mead, we came upon the   guards and sentinels, who bound us with rosy wreaths--the strongest fetter   that they have--and led us inland to their ruler. They told us on the way   that the island was the one that is called the Isle of the Blest, and that   the ruler was the Cretan Rhadamanthus. On being brought before him, we were   given fourth place among the people awaiting trial. The first case was that   of Ajax, son of Telamon, to decide whether he should be allowed to associate   with the heroes or not: he was accused of having gone mad and killed himself.   At last, when much had been said, Rhadamanthus gave judgment that for the   present he should be given in charge of Hippocrates, the Coan physician, to   take the hellebore treatment, <a name="fr_30"></a><a href="#fn_30"><font size="1">1</font></a> and that later on, when he had recovered   his wits, he should have a place at the table of the heroes. The second case   was a love-affair--Theseus and Menelaus at law over Helen, to determine which   of the two she should live with. Rhadamanthus pronounced that she should live   with Menelaus, because he had undergone so much toil and danger on account of   his marriage: then too,</p>

For baths they have   large houses of glass, warmed by burning cinnamon; instead of water there is   hot dew in the tubs. For clothing they use delicate purple spider-webs. As   for themselves, they have no bodies, but are intangible and fleshless, with   only shape and figure. Incorporeal as they are, they nevertheless live and   move and think and talk. In a word, it would appear that their naked souls go   about in the semblance of their bodies. Really, if one did not touch them, he   could not tell that what he saw was not a body, for they are like upright   shadows, only not black. Nobody grows old, but stays the same age as on   coming there. Again, it is neither night among them nor yet very bright day,   but the light which is on the country is like the gray morning toward dawn,   when the sun has not yet risen. Moreover, they are acquainted with only one   season of the year, for it is always spring there and the only wind that   blows there is Zephyr. The country abounds in flowers and plants of all   kinds, cultivated and otherwise. <a name="fr_35"></a><a href="#fn_35"><font size="1">1</font></a> The grape-vines yield twelve vintages   a year, bearing every month; the pomegranates, apples and other fruit-trees   were said to bear thirteen times a year, for in one month, their Minoan, they   bear twice.

 <p>balms, so that   they look like mushrooms. In the neighbourhood of the city there are three hunted   and sixty-five springs of water, as many of honey, five hundred of   myrrh--much smaller, however--seven rivers of milk and eight of wine.</p>   
 <p>Their table is   spread outside the city in the Elysian Fields, a very beautiful mead with   thick woods of all sorts round about it, overshadowing the feasters. The   couches they lie on are made of flowers, and they are attended and served by   the winds, who, however, do not pour out their wine, for they do not need   anyone to do this. There are great trees of the clearest glass around the   table, and instead of fruit they bear cups of all shapes and sizes. When   anyone comes to table he picks one or two of the cups and puts them at his   place. These fill with wine at once, and that is the way they get their   drink. Instead of garlands, the nightingales and the other song-birds gather   flowers in their bills from the fields hard by and drop them down like snow,   flying overhead and singing. Furthermore, the way they are scented is that   thick clouds draw up myrrh from the springs and the river, stand over the   table and under the gentle manipulation of the winds rain down a delicate   dew. At the board they pass their time with poetry and song. For the most   part they sing the epics of Homer, who is there himself and shares the revelry,   lying at table in the place above Odysseus.

 <p>But I desire to   mention the famous men whom I saw there. There were all the demigods and the   veterans of Troy except Locrian Ajax, the only one, they said, who was being   punished in the place of the wicked. Of the barbarians there were both   Cyruses, the Scythian Anacharsis, the Thracian Zamolxis and Numa the Italian.   In addition, there were Lycurgus of Sparta, Phocion and Tellus of Athens and   the wise men, all but Periander. I also saw Socrates, the son of   Sophroniscus, chopping logic with Nestor and Palamedes; about him were Hyacinthus   of Sparta, Narcissus of Thespiae, Hylas and other handsome lads. It seemed to   me that Hyacinthus was his especial favourite, for at any rate he refuted him   most. It was said that Rhadamanthus</p>

 <p>was angry at   Socrates and had often threatened to banish him from the island if he kept up   his nonsense and would not quit his irony and be merry. Plato alone was not   there: it was said that he was living in his imaginary city under the   constitution and the laws that he himself wrote. The followers of Aristippus   and Epicurus were in the highest favour among the heroes because they are   pleasant and agreeable and jolly good fellows. Aesop the Phrygian was also   there--they have him for a jester. Diogenes the Cynic had so changed his ways   that he not only married Lais the courtesan, but often got up and danced and   indulged in tomfoolery when he had had too much. None of the Stoics was   there--they were said to be still on the way up the steep hill of virtue.   With regard to Chrysippus, we heard tell that he is not permitted to set foot   on the island until he submits himself to the hellebore treatment for the   fourth time. <a name="fr_37"></a><a href="#fn_37"><font size="1">1</font></a> They said that the Academicians wanted to come but were   still holding off and debating, for they could not arrive at a conclusion   even on the question whether such an island existed. Then too I suppose they   feared to have Rhadamanthus judge them, as they themselves had abolished   standards of judgment. It was said, however, that many of them had started to   follow people coming thither, but fell behind through their slowness, being   constitutionally unable to arrive at anything, and so turned back half-way.</p>

 <p>is such that   they bill-and-coo openly, in plain sight of everyone, without any   discrimination, and think no shame of it at all. Socrates, the only   exception, used to protest that he was above suspicion in his relations with   young persons, but everyone held him guilty of perjury. In fact, Hyacinthus   and Narcissus often said that they knew better, but he persisted in his   denial. They all have their wives in common and nobody is jealous of his   neighbour; in this point they out-Plato Plato. Complaisance is the universal   rule.</p>   
 <p>Hardly two or   three days had passed before I went Up to Homer the poet when we were both at   leisure, and questioned him about everything. "Above all," said I,   "where do you come from? This point in particular is being investigated   even yet at home." "I am not unaware," said he, "that   some think me a Chian, some a Smyrniote and many a Colophonian. As a matter   of fact, I am a Babylonian, and among my fellow-countrymen my name was not   Homer but Tigranes. Later on, when I was a hostage (<i>homeros</i>) among the Greeks, I changed my name." I went on to   enquire whether the bracketed lines had been written by him, and he asserted   that they were all his own: consequently I held the grammarians Zenodotus and   Aristarchus guilty of pedantry in the highest degree. Since he had answered   satisfactorily on these points, I next asked him why he began with the wrath   of Achilles; and he said that it just came into his head that way, without   any study. Moreover, I wanted to know whether he wrote the <i>Odyssey</i> before the <i>Iliad</i>, as most people say: he said no.</p>

Often again at other times I would do this when I saw him at   leisure; I would go and make enquiries of him and he would give me a cordial   answer to everything, particularly after the lawsuit that he won, for a   charge of libel had been brought against him by Thersites because of the way   he had ridiculed him in the poem, and the case, was won by Homer, with   Odysseus for his lawyer.</p>

 <p>prizes. In the   foot-race I do not remember who won and in poetry, Homer was really far the   best man, but Hesiod won. The prize in each case was a crown that was plaited   of peacock feathers.</p>   
 <p>Hardly had the   games been concluded when word came that those who were under punishment in   the place of the wicked had burst their bonds, bad overpowered their guard,   and were advancing on the island: that they were under the leadership of   Phalaris of Acragas, Busiris the Egyptian, Diomed of Thrace, and Sciron and   Pityocamptes. When Rhadamanthus heard of this he mustered the heroes on the   shore. They were led by Theseus, Achilles and Ajax, the son of Telamon, who   by this time had recovered his wits. They engaged and fought, and the heroes   won. Achilles contributed most to their success, but Socrates, who was   stationed on the right wing, was brave, too--far more so than when he fought   at Delium in his lifetime. When four of the enemy came at him he did not run   away or change countenance. For this they afterwards gave him a special   reward, a beautiful great park in the suburbs, where he used to gather his   comrades and dispute: he named the place the Academy of the Dead. Arresting   the losers and putting them in irons, they sent them off to be punished still   more severely than before. An account of this battle was written by Homer,   and as I was leaving he gave me the book to take to the people at home, but   later I lost it along with everything else. The poem began:</p>

 <p>Six months had   passed and it was about the middle of the seventh when sedition arose.   Cinyras, the son of Scintharus, a tall and handsome lad, had long been in   love with Helen, and it was no secret that she herself was madly enamoured of   the boy. For instance, they often winked to one another at table, drank to   each other and got up together and wandered about the wood. Well, one fine   day through love and despair Cinyras determined to rape Helen--she agreed to   it--and go to one of the islands in the offing, either Cork or Cheesie. As   accomplices they had long ago taken on three of the most reckless of my   comrades; but Cinyras did not inform his father, for he knew that he would   not let him do it. When they had come to. a decision, they carried out their   stratagem. It was at nightfall, and I was not on hand, as I chanced to be   taking a nap under the table. Without the knowledge of the rest they carried   Helen off and put to sea in haste. About midnight, when Menelaus woke up, and   found that his wife was not in bed, he made a great stir and took his brother   and went to King Rhadamanthus. But as day began to break the lookouts said   that they saw the ship far out at sea. Then Rhadamanthus put fifty of the   heroes aboard a</p>

Rowing with a will,   they overtook them about noon, just as they were entering the milky place in the   ocean near Cheesie--that is all they lacked of escaping! Securing the ship   with a hawser of roses, they sailed home. Helen cried and hid her head for   shame. As to Cinyras and the rest, first Rhadamanthus asked them if they had   any other accomplices, and they said no; then he had them secured by the   offending member and sent them away to the place of the wicked, after they   had been first scourged with mallow.

 <p>With these   words he plucked a root of mallow from the ground and handed it to me,   telling me to pray to it in my greatest straits.

 <p>Well, I made   preparations for the voyage, and when the time came, joined them at the   feast. On the next day I went to the poet Homer and begged him to compose me   a couplet to carve up, and when he had done so, I set up a slab of beryl near   the harbour and had the couplet carved on it. It was:</p>

 <p>Forging ahead,   we had passed out of the fragrant atmosphere when of a sudden a terrible   odour greeted-us as of asphalt, sulphur, and pitch burning together, and a   vile, insufferable stench as of roasting human flesh: the atmosphere was   murky and foggy, and a pitchy dew distilled from it. Likewise we heard the   noise of scourges and the wailing of many men. The other islands we did not   touch at, but the one on which we landed was precipitous and sheer on all   sides; it was roughened with rocks and stony places, and there was neither   tree nor water in it. We crawled up the cliffs, however, and went ahead in a   path full of thorns and calthrops, finding the country very ugly. On coming   to the enclosure and the place of punishment, first of all we wondered at the   nature of the region. The ground itself was all sown with sword blades and   calthrops, and around it flowed three rivers, one of mud, the second of blood   and the inmost one of fire. The latter was very large, and impossible to   cross: it ran like water and undulated like the sea, and it contained many   fish, some similar to torches, and some, a smaller variety, to live coals.   They called them candlefish. There was a single narrow way leading in, past   all the rivers, and the warder set there was Timon of Athens. We got through,   however, and with Nauplius for our conductor we saw many kings undergoing   punishment, and many commoners too. Some of them we even recognized, and we   saw Cinyras</p>

The guides told the life of each, and   the crimes for which they were being punished; and the severest punishment of   all fell to those who told lies while in life and those who had written what   was not true, among whom were Ctesias of Cnidos, Herodotus and many more. On   seeing them, I had good hopes for the future, for I have never told a lie   that I know of. Well, I turned back to the ship quickly, for I could not   endure the sight, said good-bye to Nauplius, and sailed away.</p>   
 <p>After a short   time the Isle of Dreams came in sight close by, faint and uncertain to the   eye. It had itself some likeness to a dream, for as we approached it receded   and retired and retreated to a greater distance. Overtaking it at length and   sailing into the harbour called Sleep, we landed near the ivory gates, where   the sanctuary of the Cock is, about dusk, and on entering the city, we saw   many dreams of all sorts. But first I desire to speak of the city itself,   since no one else has written about it, and Homer, the only one to mention it   at all, was not quite accurate in what he said. <a name="fr_41"></a><a href="#fn_41"><font size="1">1</font></a> On all sides of it is   a wood, in which the trees are tall poppies and mandragoras, and they have a   great number of bats in them; for there is no other winged thing in the   island. A river flows near which they call Sleepwalker, and there are two   springs by the gates,</p>

 <p>named Soundly   and Eight-hours. The wall of the city is high and parti-coloured, very like a   rainbow in tint. The gates in it are not two, as Homer says, but four. Two   face Slowcoach Plain, one of which is of iron and the other of earthenware;   through these, it is said, the fearful, murderous, revolting dreams go out.   The other two face the harbour and the sea, one of which is of horn and the   other, through which we came in, of ivory. As one enters the city, on the   right is the temple of Night, for the gods they worship most are Night and   the Cock, whose sanctuary is built near the harbour. On the left is the   palace of Sleep, who rules among them and has appointed two satraps or   lieutenants, Nightmare, son of Causeless, and Rich, son of Fancy. In the   centre of the square is a spring which they call Drowsimere, and close to it   are two temples, that of Falsehood and that of Truth. There too is their holy   of holies and their oracle, which Antiphon, the interpreter of dreams,   presided over as prophet, having had this office from Sleep. As to the dreams   themselves, they differ from one another both in nature and in looks. Some   were tall, handsome and well-proportioned, while others were small and ugly;   and some were rich, I thought, while others were humble and beggarly. There   were winged and portentous dreams among them, and there were others dressed   up as if for a carnival, being clothed to represent kings and gods and   different characters of the sort. We actually recognised many of them, whom   we had seen long ago at home. These came</p>

 <p>up to us and   greeted us like old acquaintances, took us with them, put us to sleep and   entertained us very splendidly and hospitably. They treated us like lords in   every way, and even promised to make us kings and nabobs. A few of them   actually took us off home, gave us a sight of our friends and families and   brought us back the same day. For thirty days and thirty nights we stopped   with them and had a fine time--sleeping! Then of a sudden a great   thunder-clap came; we woke up, sprang out of bed and put to sea as soon as we   had laid in supplies.</p>

 <p align="center">"Odysseus to Calypso, greeting.</p>   
 <p>"Soon   after I built the raft and sailed away from you I was shipwrecked, and with   the help of Leucothea managed to reach the land of the Phaeacians in safety.   They sent me home, and there I found that my wife had a number of suitors who   were living on the fat of the land at our house. I killed them all, and was   afterwards slain by Telegonus, my son by Circe. Now I am on the Isle of the   Blest, thoroughly sorry to have given up my life with you and the immortality   which you offered me. Therefore, if I get a chance, I shall run away and come   to you." In addition to this, the letter said that she was to entertain   us. On going a short way from the sea I found the cave, which was as Homer   described it, <a name="fr_42"></a><a href="#fn_42"><font size="1">1</font></a> and found Calypso herself working wool.

 <p>she had taken   the letter and read it, she wept a long time at first, and then she asked us   in to enjoy her hospitality, gave us a splendid feast and enquired about   Odysseus and Penelope--how she looked and whether she was prudent, as   Odysseus used to boast in old times. <a name="fr_43"></a><a href="#fn_43"><font size="1">1</font></a> We made her such answers as we   thought would please her.</p>   
 <p>After that, we   went back to the ship and slept beside it on the shore, and early in the   morning we put to sea in a rising wind. We were storm-tossed for two days,   and on the third we fell in with the Pumpkin-pirates. They are savages from   the neighbouring islands who prey on passing sailors. They have large boats   of pumpkin, sixty cubits long; for after drying a pumpkin they hollow it out,   take out the insides and go sailing in it, using reeds for masts and a   pumpkin-leaf for a sail. They attacked us with two crews and gave us battle,   wounding many of us by hitting us with pumpkin-seeds instead of stones. After   fighting for a long time on even terms, about noon we saw the Nut-sailors   coming up astern of the Pumpkin-pirates. They were enemies to one another, as   they showed by their actions; for when the Pumpkin-pirates noticed them   coming up, they neglected us and faced about and fought with them. But in the   meantime we hoisted our canvas and fled, leaving them fighting. It was   evident that the Nut-sailors would win, as they were in greater</p>

 <p>When we had   lost them from sight, we attended to the wounded, and thereafter we kept   under arms most of the time, always looking for attacks. And we did not look   in vain. In fact, the sun had not yet gone down when from a desert island   there came out against us about twenty men riding on huge dolphins, who were   pirates like the others. The dolphins carried them securely and plunged and   neighed like horses. When they were close by, they separated and threw at us   from both sides with dry cuttle-fish and crabs' eyes. But when we let fly at   them with spears and arrows, they could not hold their ground, but fled to   the island, most of them wounded.</p>   
 <p>About midnight,   while it was calm, we unexpectedly ran aground on an enormous kingfisher's   nest; really, it was sixty furlongs in circumference. The female was sailing   on it, keeping her eggs warm, and she was not much smaller than the nest--in   fact, as she started up she almost sunk the ship with the wind of her wings.   She flew off, however, uttering a plaintive cry. We landed when day began to   break, and observed that the nest was like a great raft, built of huge trees.   There were five hundred eggs in it, every one of them bigger than a Chian   wine-jar, and the chicks were already visible inside them and were chirping.   We cut open one</p>

The gooseneck <a name="fr_44"></a><a href="#fn_44"><font size="1">1</font></a> suddenly grew   feathers and started cackling, the sailing-master, Scintharus, who was   already bald, became the owner of long hair, and what was strangest of all,   the ship's mast budded, branched, and bore fruit at the summit! The fruit   consisted of figs and black raisin-grapes, which were not yet ripe. <a name="fr_45"></a><a href="#fn_45"><font size="1">2</font></a> On   seeing this, we were disturbed, as well we might be, and offered a prayer to   the gods on account of the strangeness of the manifestation. We had not yet   gone five hundred furlongs when we saw a very large, thick forest of pines and   cypresses. We thought it was land, but in reality it was a bottomless sea   overgrown with rootless trees, in spite</p>   
 <p>of which the   trees stood up motionless and straight, as if they were floating. On drawing   near and forming an idea of the situation, we were in a quandary what to do,   for it was not possible to sail between the trees, they being thick and close   together, nor did it seem easy to turn back. Climbing the tallest tree, I   looked to see how things were on the other side, and I saw that the forest extended   for fifty stades or a little more, and that another ocean lay beyond.

 <p>ship on to the   tree-tops, which were thick, and cross over, if we could, to the farther   side; and that is what we did. We made her fast to a large rope, climbed the   trees and pulled her up with much ado. Setting her on the branches and   spreading our canvas, we sailed just as if we were at sea, carried along by   the force of the wind. At that juncture a line of the poet Antimachus came   into my head; he says somewhere or other:</p>   
 <p></p><dir>"And unto them their forest cruise pursuing."</dir>   
 <p>We managed the   wood in spite of everything and reached the water. Lowering the ship again in   the same way we sailed through pure, clear water, until we came to a great   crevasse made by the water dividing, like the cracks that one often sees in   the earth, made by earthquakes. Though we got in the sails, the ship was slow   to lose headway and so came near being engulfed. Peering over the edge, we   saw a precipice of fully a thousand furlongs, most frightful and   unnatural--the water stood there as if cut apart! But as we looked about us   we saw on the right at no great distance a bridge thrown across, which was of   water, joining the surfaces of the two seas and flowing from one to the   other. Rowing up, therefore, we ran into the stream and by great effort got   across, though we thought we should never do it.</p>   
 <p>Then we came to   a smooth sea and an island of no great size that was easily accessible and   was inhabited. It was peopled by savages, the Bullheads, who have horns in   the style that the</p>

Landing, we went up country to get water and food if   we could, for we no longer had any. Water we found close by, but there was   nothing else to be seen, though we heard a great bellowing not far off.   Thinking it was a herd of cattle, we went ahead cautiously and came upon the   men of whom I spoke. On seeing us, they gave chase, and captured three of my   comrades, but the rest of us made our escape to the sea. Then, however, we   all armed ourselves--it did not seem right to let our friends go   unavenged--and fell on the Bullheads while they were portioning out the flesh   of the men they had slain. We put them all to flight and gave chase, killing   about fifty and taking two alive: then we turned back to the ship with our   prisoners. We found no food, though. The rest therefore urged that the   captives be killed; I did not approve of this, however, but put them in irons   and kept them under guard until ambassadors came from the Bullheads, asking   for them and offering a ransom. We understood them because they made signs   and bellowed plaintively as if in entreaty. The ransom was a number of   cheeses, dried fish, onions, and four does, each of which had only three   feet, for while they had two behind, the forefeet had grown together. In   exchange for all this we surrendered the captives, and after stopping there a   single day we put to sea.</p>

 <p>following a   novel mode of sailing, being at once sailors and ships. Let me tell you how   they did it: they lay on their backs on the water, hoisted their jury-masts,   which are sizeable, spread sail on them, held the dews in their hands, and   were off and away as soon as the wind struck them. Others came next who sat   on corks and had a pair of dolphins hitched up, driving them and guiding them   with reins; in moving ahead, the dolphins drew the corks along. They neither   offered us harm nor ran away from us, but drove along fearlessly and   peacefully, wondering at the shape of our boat and examining her from all   sides.</p>   
 <p>In the evening   we touched at another island of no great size. It was inhabited by women--or   so we thought--who spoke Greek, and they came up to us, welcomed and embraced   us. They were got up just like courtezans and were all beautiful and young,   with tunics that swept on the ground. The island was called Witchery, and the   city Watertown. <a name="fr_46"></a><a href="#fn_46"><font size="1">1</font></a> Each of the women took one of us home with her and   made him her guest. But I excused myself for a moment--I had misgivings--and   on looking about rather carefully, saw many human bones and skulls lying   there. To make an outcry, call my comrades together and arm ourselves did not   seem best to me, but I fetched out my mallow and prayed to it earnestly that   I might escape the ills that beset me. After a little while, as my hostess   was waiting on me, I saw that her legs were not a woman's but those of an   ass. Then I drew my sword, caught and bound</p>

 <p>her and   questioned her about the whole thing. Against her will she told me that they   were women of the sea, called Asslegs and that they fed on the strangers that   visited them. "When we have made them drunk," said she, "we go   to bed with them and attack them in their sleep." On hearing this, I   left her there tied up, and myself went up to the housetop and cried out and   called my comrades together. When they had come, I told them everything,   showed them the bones and led them in to the woman who was tied up, but she   immediately turned to water and disappeared. Nevertheless I thrust my sword   into the water as a test, and the water turned to blood.</p>   
 <p>With all speed   we went back to the ship and sailed away. When the light of day began to   show, we saw land and judged it to be the world opposite the one which we   inhabit. After doing homage and offering prayer, we took thought for the   future. Some of us proposed just to land and then turn back again, others to   leave the boat there, go into the interior and see what the inhabitants were   like. While we were debating this, a violent storm struck the boat, dashed it   ashore and wrecked it, and we ourselves had much trouble in swimming out with   our arms and anything else that we could catch up.</p>
