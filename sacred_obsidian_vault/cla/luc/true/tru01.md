The little that remains of his originals has been gathered by A. Stengel (<i>De Luciani Veris Historiis</i>, Berlin 1911, from whom I cite as much as space permits).</font></p>  <h3 align="center">BOOK I</h3>  <table border="0" width="100%">  <tr>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="327">

 <p>Men interested   in athletics and in the care of their bodies think not only of condition and   exercise but also of relaxation in season; in fact, they consider this the   principal part of training. In like manner students, I think, after much   reading of serious works may profitably relax their minds and put them in   better trim for future labour. It would be appropriate recreation for them if   they were to take up the sort of reading that, instead of affording just pure   amusement based on wit and humour, also boasts a little food for thought that   the Muses would not altogether spurn; and I think they will consider the   present work something of the kind. They will find it enticing not only for   the novelty of its subject, for the humour of its plan and because I tell all   kinds of lies in a plausible and specious way, but also because everything in   my story is a more or less comical parody of one or</p>

 <p>another of the   poets, historians and philosophers of old, who have written much that smacks   of miracles and fables. I would cite them by name, were it not that you   yourself will recognise them from your reading. One of them is Ctesias, son   of Ctesiochus, of Cnidos, who wrote a great deal about India and its   characteristics that he had never seen himself nor heard from anyone else   with a reputation for truthfulness. Iambulus also wrote much that was strange   about the countries in the great sea: he made up a falsehood that is patent   to everybody, but wrote a story that is not uninteresting for all that. <a name="fr_0"></a><a href="#fn_0"><font size="1">1</font></a> Many others, with the same intent, have written about imaginary travels   and journeys of theirs, telling of huge beasts, cruel men and strange ways of   living. Their guide and instructor in this sort of charlatanry is Homer's   Odysseus, who tells Alcinous and his court about winds in bondage, one-eyed   men, cannibals and savages; also about animals with many heads, and   transformations of his comrades wrought with drugs. This stuff, and much more   like it, is what our friend humbugged the illiterate Phaeacians with! Well,   on reading all these authors, I did not find much fault with them for their   lying, as I saw that this was already a common practice even among men who   profess philosophy. <a name="fr_1"></a><a href="#fn_1"><font size="1">2</font></a> I did wonder, though, that they thought that they   could write untruths and not get caught at it.

 <p>down to   posterity, that I might not be the only one excluded from the privileges of   poetic licence, and as I had nothing true to tell, not having had any   adventures of significance, I took to lying. But my lying is far more honest   than theirs, for though I tell the truth in nothing else, I shall at least be   truthful in saying that I am a liar. I think I can escape the censure of the   world by my own admission that I am not telling a word of truth. Be it   understood, then, that I am writing about things which I have neither seen nor   had to do with nor learned from others--which, in fact, do not exist at all   and, in the nature of things, cannot exist. <a name="fr_2"></a><a href="#fn_2"><font size="1">1</font></a> Therefore my readers   should on no account believe in them.</p>   
 <p>Once upon a   time, setting out from the Pillars of Hercules and heading for the western   ocean with a fair wind, I went a-voyaging. The motive and purpose of my   journey lay in my intellectual activity and desire for adventure, and in my   wish to find out what the end of the ocean was, and who the people were that   lived on the other side. On this account I put aboard a good store of   provisions, stowed water enough, enlisted in the venture fifty of my   acquaintances who were like-minded with myself, got together also a great   quantity of arms, shipped the best sailing-master to be had at a big   inducement, and put my boat--she was a pinnace--in trim for a long and   difficult voyage. Well, for a day and a night we sailed before the wind   without making very much offing, as land was still dimly in sight; but at   sunrise on the second day the wind freshened, the</p>

 <p>sea rose,   darkness came on, and before we knew it we could no longer even get our   canvas in. Committing ourselves to the gale and giving up, we drove for   seventy-nine days. On the eightieth day, however, the sun came out suddenly   and at no great distance we saw a high, wooded island ringed about with   sounding surf, which, however, was not rough, as already the worst of the   storm was abating. <a name="fr_3"></a><a href="#fn_3"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>   
 <p>Putting in and   going ashore, we lay on the ground for some time in consequence of our long   misery, but finally we arose and told off thirty of our number to stay and   guard the ship and twenty to go inland with me and look over the island. When   we had gone forward through the wood about three furlongs from the sea, we   saw a slab of bronze, inscribed with Greek letters, faint and obliterated,   which said: "To this point came Hercules and Dionysus." There were   also two footprints in the rock close by, one of which was a hundred feet   long, the other less--to my thinking, the smaller one was left by Dionysus,   the other by Hercules. <a name="fr_4"></a><a href="#fn_4"><font size="1">2</font></a> We did obeisance and went on, but had not gone   far when we came upon a river of wine, just as like as could be to Chian. <a name="fr_5"></a><a href="#fn_5"><font size="1">3</font></a> The stream was large and full, so that in places it was actually   navigable.

 <p>to find out   where the river took its rise, and went up along the stream. What I found was   not a source, but a number of large grapevines, full of clusters; beside the   root of each flowed a spring of clear wine, and the springs gave rise to the   river. There were many fish to be seen in it, very similar to wine in colour   and in taste. In fact, on catching and eating some of them, we became drunk,   and when we cut into them we found them full of lees, of course. Later on, we   bethought ourselves to mix with them the other kind of fish, those from the   water, and so temper the strength of our edible wine.</p>   
 <p>Next, after   crossing the river at a place where it was fordable, we found something   wonderful in grapevines. The part which came out of the ground, the trunk   itself, was stout and well-grown, but the upper part was in each case a   woman, entirely perfect from the waist up. They were like our pictures of   Daphne turning into a tree when Apollo is just catching her. Out of their   finger-tips grew the branches, and they were full of grapes. Actually, the   hair of their heads was tendrils and leaves and clusters! When we came up,   they welcomed and greeted us, some of them speaking Lydian, some Indian, but   the most part Greek. They even kissed us on the lips, and everyone that was   kissed at once became reeling drunk. They did not suffer us, however, to   gather any of the fruit, but cried out in pain when it was plucked. Some of   them actually wanted us to embrace them, and two of my comrades complied, but   could not get away again. They were held fast by the part which had touched   them, for it</p>

Leaving them in the lurch, we made off to the boat, and on getting there,   told the men we had left behind about everything, including the affair of our   comrades with the vines. Then, taking jars, we furnished ourselves not only   with water but with wine from the river, encamped for the night on the beach   close by, and at daybreak put to sea with a moderate breeze.</p>   
 <p>About noon,   when the island was no longer in sight, a whirlwind suddenly arose, spun the   boat about, raised her into the air about three hundred furlongs and did not   let her down into the sea again; but while she was hung up aloft a wind   struck her sails and drove her ahead with bellying canvas. For seven days and   seven nights we sailed the air, and on the eighth day we saw a great country   in it, resembling an island, bright and round and shining with a great light.   Running in there and anchoring, we went ashore, and on investigating found   that the land was inhabited and cultivated. By day nothing was in sight from   the place, but as night came on we began to see many other islands hard by,   some larger, some smaller, and they were like fire in colour. We also saw   another country below, with cities in it and rivers and seas and forests and   mountains. This we inferred to be our own world.</p>   
 <p>We determined   to go still further inland, but we met what they call the Vulture Dragoons,   and were arrested. These are men riding on large</p>

When he had looked us over and drawn   his conclusions from our clothes, he said: "Then you are Greeks, are   you, strangers?" and when we assented, "Well, how did you get here,   with so much air to cross?" We told him all, and he began and told us   about himself: that he too was a human being, Endymion by name, who had once   been ravished from our country in his sleep, and on coming there had been   made king of the land. He said that his country was the moon that shines down   on us. <a name="fr_7"></a><a href="#fn_7"><font size="1">2</font></a> He urged us to take heart, however, and suspect no danger, for   we should have everything that we required.

 <p>you know, as   well as the moon--has been at war with us for a long time now. It began in   this way. Once upon a time I gathered together the poorest people in my   kingdom and undertook to plant a colony on the Morning Star, which was empty   and uninhabited. Phaethon out of jealousy thwarted the colonisation, meeting   us half-way at the head of his Ant Dragoons. At that time we were beaten, for   we were not a match for them in strength, and we retreated: now, however, I   desire to make war again and plant the colony. If you wish, then, you may   take part with me in the expedition and I will give each of you one of my   royal vultures and a complete outfit. We shall take the field   to-morrow." "Very well," said I, "since you think it   best."</p>   
 <p>That night we   stopped there as his guests, but at daybreak we arose and took our posts, for   the scouts signalled that the enemy was near. The number of our army was a   hundred thousand, apart from the porters, the engineers, the infantry and the   foreign allies; of this total, eighty thousand were Vulture Dragoons and   twenty thousand Grassplume-riders. The Grassplume is also a very large bird,   which instead of plumage is all shaggy with grass and has wings very like   lettuce-leaves. Next to these the Millet-shooters and the Garlic-fighters   were posted. Endymion also had allies who came from the Great Bear--thirty   thousand Flea-archers and fifty thousand Volplaneurs. The Flea-archers ride   on great fleas,</p>

 <p>from which they   get their name; the fleas are as large as twelve elephants. The Volplaneurs   are infantry, to be sure, but they fly in the air without wings. As to the   manner of their flight, they pull their long tunics up through their girdles,   let the baggy folds fill with wind as if they were sails, and are carried   along like boats. For the most part they serve as light infantry in battle.   It was said, too, that the stars over Cappadocia would send seventy thousand   Sparrowcorns and five thousand Crane Dragoons. I did not get a look at them,   as they did not come, so I have not ventured to write about their   characteristics, for the stories about them were wonderful and   incredible. <a name="fr_9"></a><a href="#fn_9"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>   
 <p>These were the   forces of Endymion. They all had the same equipment--helmets of beans (their   beans are large and tough); scale-corselets of lupines (they sew together the   skins of lupines to make the corselets, and in that country the skin of the   lupine is unbreakable, like horn); shields and swords of the Greek pattern.   When the time came, they took position thus; on the right wing, the Vulture   Dragoons and the king, with the bravest about him (we were among them); on   the left, the Grassplumes; in the centre, the allies, in whatever formation   they liked. The infantry came to about sixty million, and was deployed as   follows. Spiders in that country are numerous and large, all of them far   larger than the Cyclades islands. They were</p>

They were said to anoint their missiles with mallow   poison. Beside them were posted the Stalk-mushrooms, heavy infantry employed   at close quarters, ten thousand in number. They had the name Stalk-mushrooms   because they used mushrooms for shields and stalks of asparagus for spears.

 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> It was   said that there were tardy allies in Phaethon's case, too--the slingers whom   he had summoned from the Milky Way, and the Cloud-centaurs. The latter to be   sure, arrived just after the battle was over (if only they had not!); but the   slingers did not put in an appearance at all. On account of this, they say,   Phaethon was furious with them and afterwards ravaged their country with   fire.</p>   
 <p>This, then, was   the array with which Phaethon came on. Joining battle when the flags had been   flown and the donkeys on both sides had brayed (for they had donkeys for   trumpeters), they fought. The left wing of the Sunites fled at once, without   even receiving the charge of the Vulture Horse, and we pursued, cutting them   down. But their right wing got the better of the left on our side, and the   Sky-mosquitoes advanced in pursuit right up to the infantry. Then, when the   infantry came to the rescue, they broke and fled, especially as they saw that   the forces on their left had been defeated. It was a glorious victory, in   which many were taken alive and many were slain; so much blood flowed on the   clouds that they were dyed and looked red, as they do in our country when the   sun is setting, and so much also dripped down on the earth that I wonder   whether something of the sort did not take place in the sky long ago, when   Homer supposed that Zeus had sent a rain of blood on account of the death of   Sarpedon. <a name="fr_12"></a><a href="#fn_12"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>   
 <p>When we had   returned from the pursuit we set up two trophies, one on the spider-webs for   the infantry battle and the other, for the sky battle, on the clouds.</p>

Before   we knew it, they were coming on in plain sight, a most unparalleled   spectacle, being a combination of winged horses and men. In size the men were   as large as the Colossus of Rhodes from the waist up, and the horses were as   large as a great merchantman. Their number, however, I leave unrecorded for   fear that someone may think it incredible, it was so great. Their leader was   the Archer from the Zodiac. When they saw that their friends had been   defeated, they sent word to Phaethon to advance again, and then, on their own   account, in regular formation fell on the disordered Moonites, who had broken   ranks and scattered to pursue and to plunder. They put them all to flight,   pursued the king himself to the city and killed most of his birds; they   plucked up the trophies and overran the whole plain woven by the spiders, and   they captured me with two of my comrades. By this time Phaethon too was   present, and other trophies were being set up by their side.</p>   
 <p>As for us, we   were taken off to the sun that day, our hands tied behind our backs with a   section of spider-web. The enemy decided not to lay siege to the city, but on   their way back they built a wall through the air, so that the rays of the sun   should no longer reach the moon. The wall was double, made of cloud, so that   a genuine eclipse of the moon took place, and she was completely enshrouded</p>

He promised to   pay tribute, to be an ally and not to make war again, and volunteered to give   hostages for all this. Phaethon and his people held two assemblies; on the   first day they did not lay aside a particle of their anger, but on the second   day they softened, and the peace was made on these terms: <a name="fr_13"></a><a href="#fn_13"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>That the   Moonites permit the stars to be autonomous, and do not make war on the   Sunites;</p>   
 <p>That each   country aid the other if it be attacked;</p>   
 <p>That in yearly   tribute the King of the Moonites pay the King of the Sunites ten thousand   gallons of dew, and that he give ten thousand of his people as hostages;</p>   
 <p>That the colony   on the Morning Star be planted in common, and that anyone else who so desires   may take part in it;</p>

 <p>On those terms   peace was made, and then the wall was torn down at once and we prisoners were   restored. When we reached the moon we were met and tearfully welcomed by our   comrades and by Endymion himself. He wanted me to stay with him and join the   colony, promising to give me his own son in marriage--there are no women in   their country. But I was not to be persuaded; I asked him to let me go down   to the sea. When he perceived that he could not prevail on me, he let us go   after entertaining us for seven days.</p>   
 <p>In the   interval, while I was living on the moon, I observed some strange and   wonderful things that I wish to speak of. In the first place there is the   fact that they are not born of women but of men: they marry men and do not   even know the word woman at all! Up to the age of twenty-five each is a wife,   and thereafter a husband. They carry their children in the calf of the leg   instead of the belly. When conception takes place the calf begins to swell.   In course of time they cut it open and deliver the child dead, and then they   bring it to life by putting it in the wind with its mouth open. It seems to   me that the term "belly of the leg " <a name="fr_14"></a><a href="#fn_14"><font size="1">1</font></a> came to us Greeks from   there, since the leg performs the function of a belly with them. But I will   tell you something else, still more wonderful. They have a kind of men whom   they call the Arboreals, who are brought into the world as follows: Exsecting   a man's right genital gland, they plant it in the ground. From it grows a   very large tree of</p>

 <p>flesh,   resembling the emblem of Priapus: it has branches and leaves, and its fruit   is acorns a cubit thick. When these ripen, they harvest them and shell out   the men. Another thing, they have artificial parts that are sometimes of   ivory and sometimes, with the poor, of wood, and make use of them in their   intercourse. When a man grows old, he does not die, but is dissolved like   smoke and turns into air. They all eat the same food; they light a fire and   cook frogs on the coals--they have quantities of frogs, that fly about in the   air--and while they are cooking, they sit about them as if at table, snuff up   the rising smoke and gorge themselves. <a name="fr_15"></a><a href="#fn_15"><font size="1">1</font></a> This is the food they eat, and   their drink is air, which is squeezed into a cup and yields a liquid like   dew.

Their noses run honey of great pungency, and when   they work or take exercise, they sweat milk all over their bodies, of such   quality that cheese can actually be made from it by dripping in a little of   the honey. They make oil from onions, and it is very clear and   sweet-smelling, like myrrh. They have many water-vines, the grapes of which   are like hailstones, and to my thinking, the hail that falls down on us is   due to the bursting of the bunches when a wind strikes and shakes those   vines. They use their bellies for pockets, putting into them anything they   have use for, as they can open and shut them. These parts do not seem to have   any intestines in them or anything else, except that they are all shaggy and   hairy inside, so that the children enter them when it is cold.</p>

I am reluctant to tell you what sort of eyes they have, for fear that   you may think me lying on account of the incredibility of the story, but I   will tell you, notwithstanding. The eyes that they have are removable, and   whenever they wish they take them out and put them away until they want to   see: then they put them in and look. Many, on losing their own, borrow other   people's to see with, and the rich folk keep a quantity</p>

In the royal purlieus I saw another marvel. A large   looking-glass is fixed above a well, which is not very deep. If a man goes   down into the well, he hears everything that is said among us on earth, and   if he looks into the looking-glass he sees every city and every country just   as if he were standing over it. When I tried it I saw my family and my whole   native land, but I cannot go further and say for certain whether they also   saw me. Anyone who does not believe this is so will find, if ever he gets   there himself, that I am telling the truth.</p>   
 <p>To go back to   my story, we embraced the king and his friends, went aboard, and put off.   Endymion even gave me presents--two of the glass tunics, five of bronze, and   a suit of lupine armour--but I left them all behind in the whale. He also   sent a thousand Vulture Dragoons with us to escort us for sixty miles. On our   way we passed many countries and put in at the Morning Star, which was just   being colonised. We landed there and procured water. Going aboard and making   for the zodiac, we passed the sun to port, hugging the shore. We did not   land, though many of my comrades wanted to; for the wind was unfavourable.   But we saw that the country was green and fertile and well-watered, and full   of untold good things.

 <p>Sailing the   next night and day we reached Lamp-town toward evening, already being on our   downward way. This city lies in the air midway between the Pleiades and the   Hyades, though much lower than the Zodiac. On landing, we did not find any   men at all, but a lot of lamps running about and loitering in the public   square and at the harbour. Some of them were small and poor, so to speak: a   few, being great and powerful, were very splendid and conspicuous. Each of   them has his own house, or sconce, they have names like men, and we heard them   talking. They offered us no harm, but invited us to be their guests. We were   afraid, however, and none of us ventured to eat a mouthful or close an eye.   They have a public building in the centre of the city, where their magistrate   sits all night and calls each of them by name, and whoever does not answer is   sentenced to death for deserting. They are executed by being put out. We were   at court, saw what went on, and heard the lamps defend themselves and tell   why they came late. There I recognised our own lamp: I spoke to him and   enquired how things were at home, and he told me all about them.</p>

There we saw the city of Cloudcuckootown, <a name="fr_19"></a><a href="#fn_19"><font size="1">1</font></a> and wondered at   it, but did not visit it, as the wind did not permit. The king, however, was   said to be Crow Dawson. It made me think of Aristophanes the poet, a wise and   truthful man whose writings are distrusted without reason. On the next day   but one, the ocean was already in plain sight, but no land anywhere except   the countries in the air, and they began to appear fiery and bright. Toward   noon on the fourth day the wind fell gently and gave out, and we were set   down on the sea. When we touched the water we were marvellously pleased and   happy, made as merry as we could in every way, and went over the side for a   swim, for by good luck it was calm and the sea was smooth.</p>   
 <p>It would seem,   however, that a change for the better often proves a prelude to greater ills.   We had sailed just two days in fair weather and the third day was breaking   when toward sunrise we suddenly saw a number of sea-monsters, whales. One   among them, the largest of all, was fully one hundred and fifty miles long.   He came at us with open mouth, dashing up the sea far in advance,   foam-washed, showing teeth much larger than the emblems of Dionysus in our   country, <a name="fr_20"></a><a href="#fn_20"><font size="1">2</font></a> and all sharp as calthrops and white as ivory.

When we were inside, it was dark at first, and we could not see   anything, but afterwards, when he opened his mouth, we saw a great cavity,   flat all over and high, and large enough for the housing of a great city. In   it there were fish, large and small, and many other creatures all mangled,   ships' rigging and anchors, human bones, and merchandise. In the middle there   was land with hills on it, which to my thinking was formed of the mud that he   had swallowed. Indeed, a forest of all kinds of trees had grown on it, garden   stuff had come up, and everything appeared to be under cultivation. The coast   of the island was twenty-seven miles long. Sea-birds were to be seen nesting   on the trees, gulls and kingfishers. <a name="fr_21"></a><a href="#fn_21"><font size="1">1</font></a></p>

 <p>wonted to our   abiding-place, I took seven of my comrades and went into the forest, wishing   to have a look at everything. I had not yet gone quite five furlongs when I   found a temple of Poseidon, as the inscription indicated, and not far from it   a number of graves with stones on them. Near by was a spring of clear water.   We also heard the barking of a dog, smoke appeared in the distance, and we   made out something like a farmhouse, too.</p>   
 <p>Advancing   eagerly, we came upon an old man and a boy very busily at work in a garden   which they were irrigating with water from the spring. Joyful and fearful at   the same instant, we stopped still, and they too, probably feeling the same   as we, stood there without a word. In course of time the old man said:   "Who are you, strangers? Are you sea-gods, or only unlucky men like us?   As for ourselves, though we are men and were bred on land, the have become   sea-creatures and swim about with this beast which encompasses us, not even   knowing for certain what our condition is--we suppose that we are dead, but   trust that we are alive." To this I replied: "We too are men, my   good sir--newcomers, who were swallowed up yesterday, ship and all: and we   set out just now with the notion of finding out how things were in the   forest, for it appeared to be very large and thick. But some divinity, it   seems, brought us to see you and to discover that we are not the only people   shut up in this animal. Do tell us your adventures--who you are and how you   got in here." But he said he would neither tell us nor question us   before giving us what entertainment he could command, and he</p>

 <p>took us with   him to the house. It was a commodious structure, had bunks built in it and   was fully furnished in other ways. He set before us vegetables, fruit and   fish and poured us out wine as well. When we had had enough, he asked us what   had happened to us. I told him about everything from first to last--the   storm, the island, the cruise in the air, the war and all the rest of it up   to our descent into the whale.</p>   
 <p>He expressed   huge wonder, and then told us his own story, saying: "By birth,   strangers, J am a Cypriote. Setting out from my native land on a trading   venture with my boy whom you see and with many servants besides, I began a   voyage to Italy, bringing various wares on a great ship, which you no doubt   saw wrecked in the mouth of the whale. As far as Sicily we had a fortunate   voyage, but there we were caught by a violent wind and driven out into the   ocean for three days, where we fell in with the whale, were swallowed up crew   and all, and only we two survived, the others being killed. We buried our   comrades, built a temple to Poseidon and live this sort of life, raising   vegetables and eating fish and nuts. As you see, the forest is extensive, and   besides, it contains many grape-vines, which yield the sweetest of wine. No   doubt you noticed the spring of beautiful cold water, too. We make our bed of   leaves, burn all the wood we want, snare the birds that fly in, and catch   fresh fish by going into the gills of the animal. We also bathe there when we   care to.

Everything else is perhaps endurable, but our   neighbours and fellow-countrymen are extremely quarrelsome and unpleasant,   being unsociable and savage." "What!" said I, "are there   other people in the whale, too?" "Why, yes, lots of them,"   said he; "they are unfriendly and are oddly built. In the western part   of the forest, the tail part, live the Broilers, an eel-eyed, lobster-faced   people that are warlike and bold, and carnivorous. On one side, by the   starboard wall, live the Mergoats, <a name="fr_22"></a><a href="#fn_22"><font size="1">1</font></a> like men above and catfish below:   they are not so wicked as the others. To port there are the Crabclaws and the   Codheads, who are friends and allies with each other. The interior is   inhabited by Clan Crawfish and the Solefeet, good fighters and swift runners.   The eastern part, that near the mouth, is mostly uninhabited, as it is   subject to inundations of the sea. I live in it, however, paying the Solefeet   a tribute of five hundred oysters a year. Such being the nature of the   country, it is for you to see how we can fight with all these tribes and how   we are to get a living." "How many are there of them in all?"   said I.

 <p>he said.   "Then our best plan," said I, "would be to meet them in   battle, as they are unarmed and we have arms. If we defeat them, we shall   live here in peace the rest of our days."</p>   
 <p>This was   resolved on, and we went to the boat and made ready. The cause of war was to   be the withholding of the tribute, since the date for it had already arrived.   They sent and demanded the tax, and he gave the messengers a contemptuous   answer and drove them off. First the Solefeet and Clan Crawfish, incensed at   Scintharus--for that was his name--came on with a great uproar. Anticipating   their attack, we were waiting under arms, having previously posted in our   front-a squad of twenty-five men in ambush, who had been directed to fall on   the enemy when they saw that they had gone by, and this they did. Falling on   them in the rear, they cut them down, while we ourselves, twenty-five in   number (for Scintharus and his son were in our ranks), met them face to face   and, engaging them, ran our hazard with strength and spirit. Finally we   routed them and pursued them clear to their dens. The slain on the side of   the enemy were one hundred and seventy; on our side, one--the sailing-master,   who was run through the midriff with a mullet-rib. That day and night we   bivouacked on the field and made a trophy by setting up the dry spine of a   dolphin. On the following day the others, who had heard of it, appeared, with   the Broilers, led by Tom Cod, on the right wing, the Codheads on the, left,   and the</p>

The Mergoats did not take the field, choosing not to ally   themselves with either party. Going out to meet them, we engaged them by the   temple of Poseidon with great shouting, and the hollow re-echoed like a cave.   Routing them, as they were light-armed, and pursuing them into the forest, we   were thenceforth masters of the land. Not long afterwards they sent heralds   and were for recovering their dead and conferring about an alliance, but we   did not think it best to make terms with them. Indeed, on the following day   we marched against them and utterly exterminated them, all but the Mergoats,   and they, when they saw what was doing, ran off through the gills and threw   themselves into the sea. Occupying the country, which was now clear of the   enemy, we dwelt there in peace from that time on, constantly engaging in   sports, hunting, tending vines and gathering the fruit of the trees.

 <p>inside the   teeth we saw the most unparallelled of all the sights that ever I saw--huge   men, fully half a furlong in stature, sailing on huge islands as on galleys.   Though I know that what I am going to recount savours of the incredible, I   shall say it nevertheless. There were islands, long but not very high, and   fully a hundred furlongs in circumference, on each of which about a hundred   and twenty of those men were cruising, some of whom, sitting along each side   of the island one behind the other, were rowing with huge cypress trees for   oars--branches, leaves and all! <a name="fr_24"></a><a href="#fn_24"><font size="1">1</font></a> Aft at the stern, as I suppose you   would call it, stood the master on a high hill, holding a bronze tiller five   furlongs in length. At the bow, about forty of them under arms were fighting;   they were like men in all but their hair, which was fire and blazed up, so   that they had no need of plumes. <a name="fr_25"></a><a href="#fn_25"><font size="1">2</font></a> In lieu of sails, the wind struck the   forest, which was dense on each of the islands, filled this and carried the   island wherever the helmsman would. There were boatswains in command, to keep   the oarsmen in time, and the islands moved swiftly under the rowing, like   war-galleys.</p>   
 <p>At first we   only saw two or three, but later on about six hundred made their appearance.   Taking sides, they went to war and had a sea-fight. Many collided with one   another bows on, and many</p>

 <p>were rammed   amidships and sunk. Some, grappling one another, put up a stout fight and   were slow to cast off, for those stationed at the bows showed all zeal in   boarding and slaying: no quarter was given. Instead of iron grapnels they   threw aboard one another great devilfish with lines belayed to them, and   these gripped the woods and held the island fast. They struck and wounded one   another with oysters that would fill a wagon and with hundred-foot sponges.   The leader of one side was Aeolocentaur, of the other, Brinedrinker. Their   battle evidently came about on account of an act of piracy: Brinedrinker was   said to have driven off many herds of dolphins belonging to Aeolocentaur. We   knew this because we could hear them abusing one another and calling out the   names of their kings. Finally the side of Aeolocentaur won; they sank about a   hundred and fifty of the enemy's islands; and took three more, crews and all;   the rest backed water and fled. After pursuing them some distance, they   turned back to the wrecks at evening, making prizes of most of them and   picking up what belonged to themselves; for on their own side not less than   eighty islands had gone down. They also made a trophy of the isle-fight by   setting up one of the enemy's islands on the head of the whale. That night   they slept on shipboard around the animal, making their shore lines fast to   him and riding at anchor just off him; for they had anchors, large and   strong, made of glass. <a name="fr_26"></a><a href="#fn_26"><font size="1">1</font></a> On the following day they performed</p>
