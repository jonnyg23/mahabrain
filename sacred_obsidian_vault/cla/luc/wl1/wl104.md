   <h3 align="center">2. PROBABLE ORDER OF WRITINGS</h3>  
 <p>The received order in which Lucian's works stand is admitted to be entirely haphazard. The following arrangement in groups is roughly chronological, though it is quite possible that they overlap each other. It is M. Croiset's, put into tabular form. Many details in it are open to question; but to read in this order would at least be more satisfactory to any one who wishes to study Lucian seriously than to take the pieces as they come. The table will also serve as a rough guide to the first-class and the inferior pieces. The names italicized are those of pieces rejected as spurious by M. Croiset, and therefore not placed by him; we have inserted them where they seem to belong; as to their genuineness, it is our opinion that the objections made (not by M. Croiset, who does not discuss authenticity) to the <i>Demosthenes</i> and <i>The Cynic</i> at least are, in view of the merits of these, unconvincing.</p>

 <p></p><dir>(i) About 145 to 160 A.D. Lucian a rhetorician in Ionia, Greece, Italy, and Gaul.<br> The Tyrannicide, a rhetorical exercise.<br> The Disinherited.<br> Phalaris I &amp; II.<br> <i>Demosthenes</i>, a panegyric.<br> Patriotism, an essay.<br> The Fly, an essay.<br> Swans and Amber, an introductory lecture.<br> Dipsas, an introductory lecture.<br> The Hall, an introductory lecture.<br> Nigrinus, a dialogue on philosophy, 150 A.D.  
 <p>(ii) About 160 to 164 A.D.

 <p>The next eight groups, iv-xi, belong to the years from about 165 A.D. to about 175 A.D., when Lucian was at his best and busiest; iv-ix are to be regarded roughly as succeeding each other in time; x and xi being independent in this respect. Pieces are assigned to groups mainly according to their subjects; but some are placed in groups that do not seem at first sight the most appropriate, owing to specialties in their treatment; e.g. <i>The Ship</i> might seem more in place with vii than with ix;</p>

 <p>but M. Croiset finds in it a maturity that induces him to put it later.</p>

 <p>In conclusion, we have to say that this arrangement of M. Croiset's, which we have merely tabulated without intentionally departing from it in any particular, seems to us well considered in its broad lines; there are a few modifications which we should have been disposed to make in it; but we thought it better to take it entire than to exercise our own judgment in a matter where we felt very little confidence.</p>
