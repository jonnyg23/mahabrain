   <h1 align="center">DIALOGUES OF THE DEAD</h1>  <h3 align="center">XXIII</h3>  
 <p align="center"><i>Protesilaus. Pluto. Persephone</i></p>  
 <p><i>Pro</i>. Lord, King, our Zeus! and thou, daughter of Demeter! Grant a lover's boon!</p>  
 <p><i>Pl</i>. What do you want? who are you?</p>  
 <p><i>Pro</i>. Protesilaus, son of Iphiclus, of Phylace, one of the Achaean host, the first that died at Troy. And the boon I ask is release and one day's life.</p>  
 <p><i>Pl</i>. Ah, friend, that is the love that all these dead men love, and none shall ever win.</p>  
 <p><i>Pro</i>. Nay, dread lord, ’tis not life I love, but the bride that I left new wedded in my chamber that day I sailed away--ah me, to be slain by Hector as my foot touched land! My lord, that yearning gives me no peace. I return content, if she might look on me but for an hour.</p>  
 <p><i>Pl</i>. Did you miss your dose of Lethe, man?</p>  
 <p><i>Pro</i>. Nay, lord; but this prevailed against it.</p>  
 <p><a name="page_145"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 145</font></a></p>  
 <p><i>Pl</i>. Oh, well, wait a little; she will come to you one day; it is so simple; no need for you to be going up.</p>  
 <p><i>Pro</i>. My heart is sick with hope deferred; thou too, O Pluto, hast loved; thou knowest what love is.</p>  
 <p><i>Pl</i>. What good will it do you to come to life for a day, and then renew your pains?</p>  
 <p><i>Pro</i>. I think to win her to come with me, and bring two dead for one.</p>  
 <p><i>Pl</i>. It may not be; it never has been.</p>  
 <p><i>Pro</i>. Bethink thee, Pluto. 'Twas for this same cause that ye gave Orpheus his Eurydice; and Heracles had interest enough to be granted Alcestis; she was of my kin.</p>  
 <p><i>Pl</i>. Would you like to present that bare ugly skull to your fair bride? will she admit you, when she cannot tell you from another man? I know well enough; she will be frightened and run from you, and you will have gone all that way for nothing.</p>  
 <p><i>Per</i>. Husband, doctor that disease yourself: tell Hermes, as soon as Protesilaus reaches the light, to touch him with his wand, and make him young and fair as when he left the bridal chamber.</p>  
 <p><i>Pl</i>. Well, I cannot refuse a lady. Hermes, take him up and turn him into a bridegroom. But mind, you sir, a strictly temporary one.</p>
