 I. TO DIONYSUS (21 lines) (1)
 </p><p>
 ((LACUNA))
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-9) For some say, at Dracanum; and some, on windy Icarus;
 and some, in Naxos, O Heaven-born, Insewn (2); and others by the
 deep-eddying river Alpheus that pregnant Semele bare you to Zeus
 the thunder-lover.  And others yet, lord, say you were born in
 Thebes; but all these lie.  The Father of men and gods gave you
 birth remote from men and secretly from white-armed Hera.  There
 is a certain Nysa, a mountain most high and richly grown with
 woods, far off in Phoenice, near the streams of Aegyptus.
 </p><p>
 ((LACUNA))
 </p><p>
 (ll. 10-12) `...and men will lay up for her (3) many offerings in
 her shrines.  And as these things are three (4), so shall mortals
 ever sacrifice perfect hecatombs to you at your feasts each three
 years.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 13-16) The Son of Cronos spoke and nodded with his dark
 brows.  And the divine locks of the king flowed forward from his
 immortal head, and he made great Olympus reel.  So spake wise
 Zeus and ordained it with a nod.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 17-21) Be favourable, O Insewn, Inspirer of frenzied women! 
 we singers sing of you as we begin and as we end a strain, and
 none forgetting you may call holy song to mind.  And so,
 farewell, Dionysus, Insewn, with your mother Semele whom men call
 Thyone.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 II. TO DEMETER (495 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-3) I begin to sing of rich-haired Demeter, awful goddess
 -- of her and her trim-ankled daughter whom Aidoneus rapt away,
 given to him by all-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 4-18) Apart from Demeter, lady of the golden sword and
 glorious fruits, she was playing with the deep-bosomed daughters
 of Oceanus and gathering flowers over a soft meadow, roses and
 crocuses and beautiful violets, irises also and hyacinths and the
 narcissus, which Earth made to grow at the will of Zeus and to
 please the Host of Many, to be a snare for the bloom-like girl --
 a marvellous, radiant flower.  It was a thing of awe whether for
 deathless gods or mortal men to see: from its root grew a hundred
 blooms and is smelled most sweetly, so that all wide heaven above
 and the whole earth and the sea's salt swell laughed for joy. 
 And the girl was amazed and reached out with both hands to take
 the lovely toy; but the wide-pathed earth yawned there in the
 plain of Nysa, and the lord, Host of Many, with his immortal
 horses sprang out upon her -- the Son of Cronos, He who has many
 names (5).
 </p><p>
 (ll. 19-32) He caught her up reluctant on his golden car and bare
 her away lamenting.  Then she cried out shrilly with her voice,
 calling upon her father, the Son of Cronos, who is most high and
 excellent.  But no one, either of the deathless gods or of mortal
 men, heard her voice, nor yet the olive-trees bearing rich fruit:
 only tender-hearted Hecate, bright-coiffed, the daughter of
 Persaeus, heard the girl from her cave, and the lord Helios,
 Hyperion's bright son, as she cried to her father, the Son of
 Cronos.  But he was sitting aloof, apart from the gods, in his
 temple where many pray, and receiving sweet offerings from mortal
 men.  So he, that Son of Cronos, of many names, who is Ruler of
 Many and Host of Many, was bearing her away by leave of Zeus on
 his immortal chariot -- his own brother's child and all
 unwilling.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 33-39) And so long as she, the goddess, yet beheld earth and
 starry heaven and the strong-flowing sea where fishes shoal, and
 the rays of the sun, and still hoped to see her dear mother and
 the tribes of the eternal gods, so long hope calmed her great
 heart for all her trouble....
 ((LACUNA))
 ....and the heights of the mountains and the depths of the sea
 rang with her immortal voice: and her queenly mother heard her.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 40-53) Bitter pain seized her heart, and she rent the
 covering upon her divine hair with her dear hands: her dark cloak
 she cast down from both her shoulders and sped, like a wild-bird,
 over the firm land and yielding sea, seeking her child.  But no
 one would tell her the truth, neither god nor mortal men; and of
 the birds of omen none came with true news for her.  Then for
 nine days queenly Deo wandered over the earth with flaming
 torches in her hands, so grieved that she never tasted ambrosia
 and the sweet draught of nectar, nor sprinkled her body with
 water.  But when the tenth enlightening dawn had come, Hecate,
 with a torch in her hands, met her, and spoke to her and told her
 news:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 54-58) `Queenly Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of
 good gifts, what god of heaven or what mortal man has rapt away
 Persephone and pierced with sorrow your dear heart?  For I heard
 her voice, yet saw not with my eyes who it was.  But I tell you
 truly and shortly all I know.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 59-73) So, then, said Hecate.  And the daughter of rich-
 haired Rhea answered her not, but sped swiftly with her, holding
 flaming torches in her hands.  So they came to Helios, who is
 watchman of both gods and men, and stood in front of his horses:
 and the bright goddess enquired of him: `Helios, do you at least
 regard me, goddess as I am, if ever by word or deed of mine I
 have cheered your heart and spirit.  Through the fruitless air I
 heard the thrilling cry of my daughter whom I bare, sweet scion
 of my body and lovely in form, as of one seized violently; though
 with my eyes I saw nothing.  But you -- for with your beams you
 look down from the bright upper air Over all the earth and sea --
 tell me truly of my dear child, if you have seen her anywhere,
 what god or mortal man has violently seized her against her will
 and mine, and so made off.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 74-87) So said she.  And the Son of Hyperion answered her:
 `Queen Demeter, daughter of rich-haired Rhea, I will tell you the
 truth; for I greatly reverence and pity you in your grief for
 your trim-ankled daughter.  None other of the deathless gods is
 to blame, but only cloud-gathering Zeus who gave her to Hades,
 her father's brother, to be called his buxom wife.  And Hades
 seized her and took her loudly crying in his chariot down to his
 realm of mist and gloom.  Yet, goddess, cease your loud lament
 and keep not vain anger unrelentingly: Aidoneus, the Ruler of
 Many, is no unfitting husband among the deathless gods for your
 child, being your own brother and born of the same stock: also,
 for honour, he has that third share which he received when
 division was made at the first, and is appointed lord of those
 among whom he dwells.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 88-89) So he spake, and called to his horses: and at his
 chiding they quickly whirled the swift chariot along, like long-
 winged birds.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 90-112) But grief yet more terrible and savage came into the
 heart of Demeter, and thereafter she was so angered with the
 dark-clouded Son of Cronos that she avoided the gathering of the
 gods and high Olympus, and went to the towns and rich fields of
 men, disfiguring her form a long while.  And no one of men or
 deep-bosomed women knew her when they saw her, until she came to
 the house of wise Celeus who then was lord of fragrant Eleusis. 
 Vexed in her dear heart, she sat near the wayside by the Maiden
 Well, from which the women of the place were used to draw water,
 in a shady place over which grew an olive shrub.  And she was
 like an ancient woman who is cut off from childbearing and the
 gifts of garland-loving Aphrodite, like the nurses of king's
 children who deal justice, or like the house-keepers in their
 echoing halls.  There the daughters of Celeus, son of Eleusis,
 saw her, as they were coming for easy-drawn water, to carry it in
 pitchers of bronze to their dear father's house: four were they
 and like goddesses in the flower of their girlhood, Callidice and
 Cleisidice and lovely Demo and Callithoe who was the eldest of
 them all.  They knew her not, -- for the gods are not easily
 discerned by mortals -- but standing near by her spoke winged
 words:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 113-117) `Old mother, whence and who are you of folk born
 long ago?  Why are you gone away from the city and do not draw
 near the houses?  For there in the shady halls are women of just
 such age as you, and others younger; and they would welcome you
 both by word and by deed.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 118-144) Thus they said.  And she, that queen among
 goddesses answered them saying: `Hail, dear children, whosoever
 you are of woman-kind.  I will tell you my story; for it is not
 unseemly that I should tell you truly what you ask.  Doso is my
 name, for my stately mother gave it me.  And now I am come from
 Crete over the sea's wide back, -- not willingly; but pirates
 brought be thence by force of strength against my liking. 
 Afterwards they put in with their swift craft to Thoricus, and
 there the women landed on the shore in full throng and the men
 likewise, and they began to make ready a meal by the stern-cables
 of the ship.  But my heart craved not pleasant food, and I fled
 secretly across the dark country and escaped by masters, that
 they should not take me unpurchased across the sea, there to win
 a price for me.  And so I wandered and am come here: and I know
 not at all what land this is or what people are in it.  But may
 all those who dwell on Olympus give you husbands and birth of
 children as parents desire, so you take pity on me, maidens, and
 show me this clearly that I may learn, dear children, to the
 house of what man and woman I may go, to work for them cheerfully
 at such tasks as belong to a woman of my age.  Well could I nurse
 a new born child, holding him in my arms, or keep house, or
 spread my masters' bed in a recess of the well-built chamber, or
 teach the women their work.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 145-146) So said the goddess.  And straightway the unwed
 maiden Callidice, goodliest in form of the daughters of Celeus,
 answered her and said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 147-168) `Mother, what the gods send us, we mortals bear
 perforce, although we suffer; for they are much stronger than we.
 </p><p>
 But now I will teach you clearly, telling you the names of men
 who have great power and honour here and are chief among the
 people, guarding our city's coif of towers by their wisdom and
 true judgements: there is wise Triptolemus and Dioclus and
 Polyxeinus and blameless Eumolpus and Dolichus and our own brave
 father.  All these have wives who manage in the house, and no one
 of them, so soon as she has seen you, would dishonour you and
 turn you from the house, but they will welcome you; for indeed
 you are godlike.  But if you will, stay here; and we will go to
 our father's house and tell Metaneira, our deep-bosomed mother,
 all this matter fully, that she may bid you rather come to our
 home than search after the houses of others.  She has an only
 son, late-born, who is being nursed in our well-built house, a
 child of many prayers and welcome: if you could bring him up
 until he reached the full measure of youth, any one of womankind
 who should see you would straightway envy you, such gifts would
 our mother give for his upbringing.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 169-183) So she spake: and the goddess bowed her head in
 assent.  And they filled their shining vessels with water and
 carried them off rejoicing.  Quickly they came to their father's
 great house and straightway told their mother according as they
 had heard and seen.  Then she bade them go with all speed and
 invite the stranger to come for a measureless hire.  As hinds or
 heifers in spring time, when sated with pasture, bound about a
 meadow, so they, holding up the folds of their lovely garments,
 darted down the hollow path, and their hair like a crocus flower
 streamed about their shoulders.  And they found the good goddess
 near the wayside where they had left her before, and led her to
 the house of their dear father.  And she walked behind,
 distressed in her dear heart, with her head veiled and wearing a
 dark cloak which waved about the slender feet of the goddess.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 184-211) Soon they came to the house of heaven-nurtured
 Celeus and went through the portico to where their queenly mother
 sat by a pillar of the close-fitted roof, holding her son, a
 tender scion, in her bosom.  And the girls ran to her.  But the
 goddess walked to the threshold: and her head reached the roof
 and she filled the doorway with a heavenly radiance.  Then awe
 and reverence and pale fear took hold of Metaneira, and she rose
 up from her couch before Demeter, and bade her be seated.  But
 Demeter, bringer of seasons and giver of perfect gifts, would not
 sit upon the bright couch, but stayed silent with lovely eyes
 cast down until careful Iambe placed a jointed seat for her and
 threw over it a silvery fleece.  Then she sat down and held her
 veil in her hands before her face.  A long time she sat upon the
 stool (6) without speaking because of her sorrow, and greeted no
 one by word or by sign, but rested, never smiling, and tasting
 neither food nor drink, because she pined with longing for her
 deep-bosomed daughter, until careful Iambe -- who pleased her
 moods in aftertime also -- moved the holy lady with many a quip
 and jest to smile and laugh and cheer her heart.  Then Metaneira
 filled a cup with sweet wine and offered it to her; but she
 refused it, for she said it was not lawful for her to drink red
 wine, but bade them mix meal and water with soft mint and give
 her to drink.  And Metaneira mixed the draught and gave it to the
 goddess as she bade.  So the great queen Deo received it to
 observe the sacrament.... (7)
 </p><p>
 ((LACUNA))
 </p><p>
 (ll. 212-223) And of them all, well-girded Metaneira first began
 to speak: `Hail, lady!  For I think you are not meanly but nobly
 born; truly dignity and grace are conspicuous upon your eyes as
 in the eyes of kings that deal justice.  Yet we mortals bear
 perforce what the gods send us, though we be grieved; for a yoke
 is set upon our necks.  But now, since you are come here, you
 shall have what I can bestow: and nurse me this child whom the
 gods gave me in my old age and beyond my hope, a son much prayed
 for.  If you should bring him up until he reach the full measure
 of youth, any one of womankind that sees you will straightway
 envy you, so great reward would I give for his upbringing.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 224-230) Then rich-haired Demeter answered her: `And to you,
 also, lady, all hail, and may the gods give you good!  Gladly
 will I take the boy to my breast, as you bid me, and will nurse
 him.  Never, I ween, through any heedlessness of his nurse shall
 witchcraft hurt him nor yet the Undercutter (8): for I know a
 charm far stronger than the Woodcutter, and I know an excellent
 safeguard against woeful witchcraft.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 231-247) When she had so spoken, she took the child in her
 fragrant bosom with her divine hands: and his mother was glad in
 her heart.  So the goddess nursed in the palace Demophoon, wise
 Celeus' goodly son whom well-girded Metaneira bare.  And the
 child grew like some immortal being, not fed with food nor
 nourished at the breast: for by day rich-crowned Demeter would
 anoint him with ambrosia as if he were the offspring of a god and
 breathe sweetly upon him as she held him in her bosom.  But at
 night she would hide him like a brand in the heard of the fire,
 unknown to his dear parents.  And it wrought great wonder in
 these that he grew beyond his age; for he was like the gods face
 to face.  And she would have made him deathless and unageing, had
 not well-girded Metaneira in her heedlessness kept watch by night
 from her sweet-smelling chamber and spied.  But she wailed and
 smote her two hips, because she feared for her son and was
 greatly distraught in her heart; so she lamented and uttered
 winged words:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 248-249) `Demophoon, my son, the strange woman buries you
 deep in fire and works grief and bitter sorrow for me.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 250-255) Thus she spoke, mourning.  And the bright goddess,
 lovely-crowned Demeter, heard her, and was wroth with her.  So
 with her divine hands she snatched from the fire the dear son
 whom Metaneira had born unhoped-for in the palace, and cast him
 from her to the ground; for she was terribly angry in her heart. 
 Forthwith she said to well-girded Metaneira:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 256-274) `Witless are you mortals and dull to foresee your
 lot, whether of good or evil, that comes upon you.  For now in
 your heedlessness you have wrought folly past healing; for -- be
 witness the oath of the gods, the relentless water of Styx -- I
 would have made your dear son deathless and unaging all his days
 and would have bestowed on him everlasting honour, but now he can
 in no way escape death and the fates.  Yet shall unfailing honour
 always rest upon him, because he lay upon my knees and slept in
 my arms.  But, as the years move round and when he is in his
 prime, the sons of the Eleusinians shall ever wage war and dread
 strife with one another continually.  Lo!  I am that Demeter who
 has share of honour and is the greatest help and cause of joy to
 the undying gods and mortal men.  But now, let all the people
 build be a great temple and an altar below it and beneath the
 city and its sheer wall upon a rising hillock above Callichorus. 
 And I myself will teach my rites, that hereafter you may
 reverently perform them and so win the favour of my heart.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 275-281) When she had so said, the goddess changed her
 stature and her looks, thrusting old age away from her: beauty
 spread round about her and a lovely fragrance was wafted from her
 sweet-smelling robes, and from the divine body of the goddess a
 light shone afar, while golden tresses spread down over her
 shoulders, so that the strong house was filled with brightness as
 with lightning.  And so she went out from the palace.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 281-291) And straightway Metaneira's knees were loosed and
 she remained speechless for a long while and did not remember to
 take up her late-born son from the ground.  But his sisters heard
 his pitiful wailing and sprang down from their well-spread beds:
 one of them took up the child in her arms and laid him in her
 bosom, while another revived the fire, and a third rushed with
 soft feet to bring their mother from her fragrant chamber.  And
 they gathered about the struggling child and washed him,
 embracing him lovingly; but he was not comforted, because nurses
 and handmaids much less skilful were holding him now.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 292-300) All night long they sought to appease the glorious
 goddess, quaking with fear.  But, as soon as dawn began to show,
 they told powerful Celeus all things without fail, as the lovely-
 crowned goddess Demeter charged them.  So Celeus called the
 countless people to an assembly and bade them make a goodly
 temple for rich-haired Demeter and an altar upon the rising
 hillock.  And they obeyed him right speedily and harkened to his
 voice, doing as he commanded.  As for the child, he grew like an
 immortal being.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 301-320) Now when they had finished building and had drawn
 back from their toil, they went every man to his house.  But
 golden-haired Demeter sat there apart from all the blessed gods
 and stayed, wasting with yearning for her deep-bosomed daughter. 
 Then she caused a most dreadful and cruel year for mankind over
 the all-nourishing earth: the ground would not make the seed
 sprout, for rich-crowned Demeter kept it hid.  In the fields the
 oxen drew many a curved plough in vain, and much white barley was
 cast upon the land without avail.  So she would have destroyed
 the whole race of man with cruel famine and have robbed them who
 dwell on Olympus of their glorious right of gifts and sacrifices,
 had not Zeus perceived and marked this in his heart.  First he
 sent golden-winged Iris to call rich-haired Demeter, lovely in
 form.  So he commanded.  And she obeyed the dark-clouded Son of
 Cronos, and sped with swift feet across the space between.  She
 came to the stronghold of fragrant Eleusis, and there finding
 dark-cloaked Demeter in her temple, spake to her and uttered
 winged words:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 321-323) `Demeter, father Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting,
 calls you to come join the tribes of the eternal gods: come
 therefore, and let not the message I bring from Zeus pass
 unobeyed.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 324-333) Thus said Iris imploring her.  But Demeter's heart
 was not moved.  Then again the father sent forth all the blessed
 and eternal gods besides: and they came, one after the other, and
 kept calling her and offering many very beautiful gifts and
 whatever right she might be pleased to choose among the deathless
 gods.  Yet no one was able to persuade her mind and will, so
 wrath was she in her heart; but she stubbornly rejected all their
 words: for she vowed that she would never set foot on fragrant
 Olympus nor let fruit spring out of the ground, until she beheld
 with her eyes her own fair-faced daughter.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 334-346) Now when all-seeing Zeus the loud-thunderer heard
 this, he sent the Slayer of Argus whose wand is of gold to
 Erebus, so that having won over Hades with soft words, he might
 lead forth chaste Persephone to the light from the misty gloom to
 join the gods, and that her mother might see her with her eyes
 and cease from her anger.  And Hermes obeyed, and leaving the
 house of Olympus, straightway sprang down with speed to the
 hidden places of the earth.  And he found the lord Hades in his
 house seated upon a couch, and his shy mate with him, much
 reluctant, because she yearned for her mother.  But she was afar
 off, brooding on her fell design because of the deeds of the
 blessed gods.  And the strong Slayer of Argus drew near and said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 347-356) `Dark-haired Hades, ruler over the departed, father
 Zeus bids me bring noble Persephone forth from Erebus unto the
 gods, that her mother may see her with her eyes and cease from
 her dread anger with the immortals; for now she plans an awful
 deed, to destroy the weakly tribes of earthborn men by keeping
 seed hidden beneath the earth, and so she makes an end of the
 honours of the undying gods.  For she keeps fearful anger and
 does not consort with the gods, but sits aloof in her fragrant
 temple, dwelling in the rocky hold of Eleusis.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 357-359) So he said.  And Aidoneus, ruler over the dead,
 smiled grimly and obeyed the behest of Zeus the king.  For he
 straightway urged wise Persephone, saying:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 360-369) `Go now, Persephone, to your dark-robed mother, go,
 and feel kindly in your heart towards me: be not so exceedingly
 cast down; for I shall be no unfitting husband for you among the
 deathless gods, that am own brother to father Zeus.  And while
 you are here, you shall rule all that lives and moves and shall
 have the greatest rights among the deathless gods: those who
 defraud you and do not appease your power with offerings,
 reverently performing rites and paying fit gifts, shall be
 punished for evermore.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 370-383) When he said this, wise Persephone was filled with
 joy and hastily sprang up for gladness.  But he on his part
 secretly gave her sweet pomegranate seed to eat, taking care for
 himself that she might not remain continually with grave, dark-
 robed Demeter.  Then Aidoneus the Ruler of Many openly got ready
 his deathless horses beneath the golden chariot.  And she mounted
 on the chariot, and the strong Slayer of Argos took reins and
 whip in his dear hands and drove forth from the hall, the horses
 speeding readily.  Swiftly they traversed their long course, and
 neither the sea nor river-waters nor grassy glens nor mountain-
 peaks checked the career of the immortal horses, but they clave
 the deep air above them as they went.  And Hermes brought them to
 the place where rich-crowned Demeter was staying and checked them
 before her fragrant temple.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 384-404) And when Demeter saw them, she rushed forth as does
 a Maenad down some thick-wooded mountain, while Persephone on the
 other side, when she saw her mother's sweet eyes, left the
 chariot and horses, and leaped down to run to her, and falling
 upon her neck, embraced her.  But while Demeter was still holding
 her dear child in her arms, her heart suddenly misgave her for
 some snare, so that she feared greatly and ceased fondling her
 daughter and asked of her at once:  `My child, tell me, surely
 you have not tasted any food while you were below?  Speak out and
 hide nothing, but let us both know.  For if you have not, you
 shall come back from loathly Hades and live with me and your
 father, the dark-clouded Son of Cronos and be honoured by all the
 deathless gods; but if you have tasted food, you must go back
 again beneath the secret places of the earth, there to dwell a
 third part of the seasons every year: yet for the two parts you
 shall be with me and the other deathless gods.  But when the
 earth shall bloom with the fragrant flowers of spring in every
 kind, then from the realm of darkness and gloom thou shalt come
 up once more to be a wonder for gods and mortal men.  And now
 tell me how he rapt you away to the realm of darkness and gloom,
 and by what trick did the strong Host of Many beguile you?'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 405-433) Then beautiful Persephone answered her thus:
 'Mother, I will tell you all without error.  When luck-bringing
 Hermes came, swift messenger from my father the Son of Cronos and
 the other Sons of Heaven, bidding me come back from Erebus that
 you might see me with your eyes and so cease from your anger and
 fearful wrath against the gods, I sprang up at once for joy; but
 he secretly put in my mouth sweet food, a pomegranate seed, and
 forced me to taste against my will.  Also I will tell how he rapt
 me away by the deep plan of my father the Son of Cronos and
 carried me off beneath the depths of the earth, and will relate
 the whole matter as you ask.  All we were playing in a lovely
 meadow, Leucippe (9) and Phaeno and Electra and Ianthe, Melita
 also and Iache with Rhodea and Callirhoe and Melobosis and Tyche
 and Ocyrhoe, fair as a flower, Chryseis, Ianeira, Acaste and
 Admete and Rhodope and Pluto and charming Calypso; Styx too was
 there and Urania and lovely Galaxaura with Pallas who rouses
 battles and Artemis delighting in arrows: we were playing and
 gathering sweet flowers in our hands, soft crocuses mingled with
 irises and hyacinths, and rose-blooms and lilies, marvellous to
 see, and the narcissus which the wide earth caused to grow yellow
 as a crocus.  That I plucked in my joy; but the earth parted
 beneath, and there the strong lord, the Host of Many, sprang
 forth and in his golden chariot he bore me away, all unwilling,
 beneath the earth: then I cried with a shrill cry.  All this is
 true, sore though it grieves me to tell the tale.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 434-437) So did they turn, with hearts at one, greatly cheer
 each the other's soul and spirit with many an embrace: their
 heart had relief from their griefs while each took and gave back
 joyousness.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 438-440) Then bright-coiffed Hecate came near to them, and
 often did she embrace the daughter of holy Demeter: and from that
 time the lady Hecate was minister and companion to Persephone.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 441-459) And all-seeing Zeus sent a messenger to them, rich-
 haired Rhea, to bring dark-cloaked Demeter to join the families
 of the gods: and he promised to give her what right she should
 choose among the deathless gods and agreed that her daughter
 should go down for the third part of the circling year to
 darkness and gloom, but for the two parts should live with her
 mother and the other deathless gods.  Thus he commanded.  And the
 goddess did not disobey the message of Zeus; swiftly she rushed
 down from the peaks of Olympus and came to the plain of Rharus,
 rich, fertile corn-land once, but then in nowise fruitful, for it
 lay idle and utterly leafless, because the white grains was
 hidden by design of trim-ankled Demeter.  But afterwards, as
 springtime waxed, it was soon to be waving with long ears of
 corn, and its rich furrows to be loaded with grain upon the
 ground, while others would already be bound in sheaves.  There
 first she landed from the fruitless upper air: and glad were the
 goddesses to see each other and cheered in heart.  Then bright-
 coiffed Rhea said to Demeter:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 460-469) `Come, my daughter; for far-seeing Zeus the loud-
 thunderer calls you to join the families of the gods, and has
 promised to give you what rights you please among the deathless
 gods, and has agreed that for a third part of the circling year
 your daughter shall go down to darkness and gloom, but for the
 two parts shall be with you and the other deathless gods: so has
 he declared it shall be and has bowed his head in token.  But
 come, my child, obey, and be not too angry unrelentingly with the
 dark-clouded Son of Cronos; but rather increase forthwith for men
 the fruit that gives them life.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 470-482) So spake Rhea.  And rich-crowned Demeter did not
 refuse but straightway made fruit to spring up from the rich
 lands, so that the whole wide earth was laden with leaves and
 flowers.  Then she went, and to the kings who deal justice,
 Triptolemus and Diocles, the horse-driver, and to doughty
 Eumolpus and Celeus, leader of the people, she showed the conduct
 of her rites and taught them all her mysteries, to Triptolemus
 and Polyxeinus and Diocles also, -- awful mysteries which no one
 may in any way transgress or pry into or utter, for deep awe of
 the gods checks the voice.  Happy is he among men upon earth who
 has seen these mysteries; but he who is uninitiate and who has no
 part in them, never has lot of like good things once he is dead,
 down in the darkness and gloom.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 483-489) But when the bright goddess had taught them all,
 they went to Olympus to the gathering of the other gods.  And
 there they dwell beside Zeus who delights in thunder, awful and
 reverend goddesses.  Right blessed is he among men on earth whom
 they freely love: soon they do send Plutus as guest to his great
 house, Plutus who gives wealth to mortal men.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 490-495) And now, queen of the land of sweet Eleusis and
 sea-girt Paros and rocky Antron, lady, giver of good gifts,
 bringer of seasons, queen Deo, be gracious, you and your daughter
 all beauteous Persephone, and for my song grant me heart-cheering
 substance.  And now I will remember you and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 III. TO APOLLO (546 lines)
 </p><p>
 TO DELIAN APOLLO --
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-18) I will remember and not be unmindful of Apollo who
 shoots afar.  As he goes through the house of Zeus, the gods
 tremble before him and all spring up from their seats when he
 draws near, as he bends his bright bow.  But Leto alone stays by
 the side of Zeus who delights in thunder; and then she unstrings
 his bow, and closes his quiver, and takes his archery from his
 strong shoulders in her hands and hangs them on a golden peg
 against a pillar of his father's house.  Then she leads him to a
 seat and makes him sit: and the Father gives him nectar in a
 golden cup welcoming his dear son, while the other gods make him
 sit down there, and queenly Leto rejoices because she bare a
 mighty son and an archer.  Rejoice, blessed Leto, for you bare
 glorious children, the lord Apollo and Artemis who delights in
 arrows; her in Ortygia, and him in rocky Delos, as you rested
 against the great mass of the Cynthian hill hard by a palm-tree
 by the streams of Inopus.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 19-29) How, then, shall I sing of you who in all ways are a
 worthy theme of song?  For everywhere, O Phoebus, the whole range
 of song is fallen to you, both over the mainland that rears
 heifers and over the isles.  All mountain-peaks and high
 headlands of lofty hills and rivers flowing out to the deep and
 beaches sloping seawards and havens of the sea are your delight. 
 Shall I sing how at the first Leto bare you to be the joy of men,
 as she rested against Mount Cynthus in that rocky isle, in sea-
 girt Delos -- while on either hand a dark wave rolled on
 landwards driven by shrill winds -- whence arising you rule over
 all mortal men?
 </p><p>
 (ll. 30-50) Among those who are in Crete, and in the township of
 Athens, and in the isle of Aegina and Euboea, famous for ships,
 in Aegae and Eiresiae and Peparethus near the sea, in Thracian
 Athos and Pelion's towering heights and Thracian Samos and the
 shady hills of Ida, in Scyros and Phocaea and the high hill of
 Autocane and fair-lying Imbros and smouldering Lemnos and rich
 Lesbos, home of Macar, the son of Aeolus, and Chios, brightest of
 all the isles that lie in the sea, and craggy Mimas and the
 heights of Corycus and gleaming Claros and the sheer hill of
 Aesagea and watered Samos and the steep heights of Mycale, in
 Miletus and Cos, the city of Meropian men, and steep Cnidos and
 windy Carpathos, in Naxos and Paros and rocky Rhenaea -- so far
 roamed Leto in travail with the god who shoots afar, to see if
 any land would be willing to make a dwelling for her son.  But
 they greatly trembled and feared, and none, not even the richest
 of them, dared receive Phoebus, until queenly Leto set foot on
 Delos and uttered winged words and asked her:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 51-61) `Delos, if you would be willing to be the abode of my
 son "Phoebus Apollo and make him a rich temple --; for no other
 will touch you, as you will find: and I think you will never be
 rich in oxen and sheep, nor bear vintage nor yet produce plants
 abundantly.  But if you have the temple of far-shooting Apollo,
 all men will bring you hecatombs and gather here, and incessant
 savour of rich sacrifice will always arise, and you will feed
 those who dwell in you from the hand of strangers; for truly your
 own soil is not rich.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 62-82) So spake Leto.  And Delos rejoiced and answered and
 said:  `Leto, most glorious daughter of great Coeus, joyfully
 would I receive your child the far-shooting lord; for it is all
 too true that I am ill-spoken of among men, whereas thus I should
 become very greatly honoured.  But this saying I fear, and I will
 not hide it from you, Leto.  They say that Apollo will be one
 that is very haughty and will greatly lord it among gods and men
 all over the fruitful earth.  Therefore, I greatly fear in heart
 and spirit that as soon as he sets the light of the sun, he will
 scorn this island -- for truly I have but a hard, rocky soil --
 and overturn me and thrust me down with his feet in the depths of
 the sea; then will the great ocean wash deep above my head for
 ever, and he will go to another land such as will please him,
 there to make his temple and wooded groves.  So, many-footed
 creatures of the sea will make their lairs in me and black seals
 their dwellings undisturbed, because I lack people.  Yet if you
 will but dare to sware a great oath, goddess, that here first he
 will build a glorious temple to be an oracle for men, then let
 him afterwards make temples and wooded groves amongst all men;
 for surely he will be greatly renowned.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 83-88) So said Delos.  And Leto sware the great oath of the
 gods: `Now hear this, Earth and wide Heaven above, and dropping
 water of Styx (this is the strongest and most awful oath for the
 blessed gods), surely Phoebus shall have here his fragrant altar
 and precinct, and you he shall honour above all.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 89-101) Now when Leto had sworn and ended her oath, Delos
 was very glad at the birth of the far-shooting lord.  But Leto
 was racked nine days and nine nights with pangs beyond wont.  And
 there were with her all the chiefest of the goddesses, Dione and
 Rhea and Ichnaea and Themis and loud-moaning Amphitrite and the
 other deathless goddesses save white-armed Hera, who sat in the
 halls of cloud-gathering Zeus.  Only Eilithyia, goddess of sore
 travail, had not heard of Leto's trouble, for she sat on the top
 of Olympus beneath golden clouds by white-armed Hera's
 contriving, who kept her close through envy, because Leto with
 the lovely tresses was soon to bear a son faultless and strong.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 102-114) But the goddesses sent out Iris from the well-set
 isle to bring Eilithyia, promising her a great necklace strung
 with golden threads, nine cubits long.  And they bade Iris call
 her aside from white-armed Hera, lest she might afterwards turn
 her from coming with her words.  When swift Iris, fleet of foot
 as the wind, had heard all this, she set to run; and quickly
 finishing all the distance she came to the home of the gods,
 sheer Olympus, and forthwith called Eilithyia out from the hall
 to the door and spoke winged words to her, telling her all as the
 goddesses who dwell on Olympus had bidden her.  So she moved the
 heart of Eilithyia in her dear breast; and they went their way,
 like shy wild-doves in their going.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 115-122) And as soon as Eilithyia the goddess of sore
 travail set foot on Delos, the pains of birth seized Leto, and
 she longed to bring forth; so she cast her arms about a palm tree
 and kneeled on the soft meadow while the earth laughed for joy
 beneath.  Then the child leaped forth to the light, and all the
 goddesses washed you purely and cleanly with sweet water, and
 swathed you in a white garment of fine texture, new-woven, and
 fastened a golden band about you.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 123-130) Now Leto did not give Apollo, bearer of the golden
 blade, her breast; but Themis duly poured nectar and ambrosia
 with her divine hands: and Leto was glad because she had borne a
 strong son and an archer.  But as soon as you had tasted that
 divine heavenly food, O Phoebus, you could no longer then be held
 by golden cords nor confined with bands, but all their ends were
 undone.  Forthwith Phoebus Apollo spoke out among the deathless
 goddesses:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 131-132) `The lyre and the curved bow shall ever be dear to
 me, and I will declare to men the unfailing will of Zeus.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 133-139) So said Phoebus, the long-haired god who shoots
 afar and began to walk upon the wide-pathed earth; and all
 goddesses were amazed at him.  Then with gold all Delos was
 laden, beholding the child of Zeus and Leto, for joy because the
 god chose her above the islands and shore to make his dwelling in
 her: and she loved him yet more in her heart, and blossomed as
 does a mountain-top with woodland flowers.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 140-164) And you, O lord Apollo, god of the silver bow,
 shooting afar, now walked on craggy Cynthus, and now kept
 wandering about the island and the people in them.  Many are your
 temples and wooded groves, and all peaks and towering bluffs of
 lofty mountains and rivers flowing to the sea are dear to you,
 Phoebus, yet in Delos do you most delight your heart; for there
 the long robed Ionians gather in your honour with their children
 and shy wives: mindful, they delight you with boxing and dancing
 and song, so often as they hold their gathering.  A man would say
 that they were deathless and unageing if he should then come upon
 the Ionians so met together.  For he would see the graces of them
 all, and would be pleased in heart gazing at the men and well-
 girded women with their swift ships and great wealth.  And there
 is this great wonder besides -- and its renown shall never perish
 -- the girls of Delos, hand-maidens of the Far-shooter; for when
 they have praised Apollo first, and also Leto and Artemis who
 delights in arrows, they sing a strain-telling of men and women
 of past days, and charm the tribes of men.  Also they can imitate
 the tongues of all men and their clattering speech: each would
 say that he himself were singing, so close to truth is their
 sweet song.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 165-178) And now may Apollo be favourable and Artemis; and
 farewell all you maidens.  Remember me in after time whenever any
 one of men on earth, a stranger who has seen and suffered much,
 comes here and asks of you: `Whom think ye, girls, is the
 sweetest singer that comes here, and in whom do you most
 delight?'  Then answer, each and all, with one voice: `He is a
 blind man, and dwells in rocky Chios: his lays are evermore
 supreme.'  As for me, I will carry your renown as far as I roam
 over the earth to the well-placed this thing is true.  And I will
 never cease to praise far-shooting Apollo, god of the silver bow,
 whom rich-haired Leto bare.
 </p><p>
 TO PYTHIAN APOLLO --
 </p><p>
 (ll. 179-181) O Lord, Lycia is yours and lovely Maeonia and
 Miletus, charming city by the sea, but over wave-girt Delos you
 greatly reign your own self.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 182-206) Leto's all-glorious son goes to rocky Pytho,
 playing upon his hollow lyre, clad in divine, perfumed garments;
 and at the touch of the golden key his lyre sings sweet.  Thence,
 swift as thought, he speeds from earth to Olympus, to the house
 of Zeus, to join the gathering of the other gods: then
 straightway the undying gods think only of the lyre and song, and
 all the Muses together, voice sweetly answering voice, hymn the
 unending gifts the gods enjoy and the sufferings of men, all that
 they endure at the hands of the deathless gods, and how they live
 witless and helpless and cannot find healing for death or defence
 against old age.  Meanwhile the rich-tressed Graces and cheerful
 Seasons dance with Harmonia and Hebe and Aphrodite, daughter of
 Zeus, holding each other by the wrist.  And among them sings one,
 not mean nor puny, but tall to look upon and enviable in mien,
 Artemis who delights in arrows, sister of Apollo.  Among them
 sport Ares and the keen-eyed Slayer of Argus, while Apollo plays
 his lyre stepping high and featly and a radiance shines around
 him, the gleaming of his feet and close-woven vest.  And they,
 even gold-tressed Leto and wise Zeus, rejoice in their great
 hearts as they watch their dear son playing among the undying
 gods.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 207-228) How then shall I sing of you -- though in all ways
 you are a worthy theme for song?  Shall I sing of you as wooer
 and in the fields of love, how you went wooing the daughter of
 Azan along with god-like Ischys the son of well-horsed Elatius,
 or with Phorbas sprung from Triops, or with Ereutheus, or with
 Leucippus and the wife of Leucippus....
 ((LACUNA))
 ....you on foot, he with his chariot, yet he fell not short of
 Triops.  Or shall I sing how at the first you went about the
 earth seeking a place of oracle for men, O far-shooting Apollo? 
 To Pieria first you went down from Olympus and passed by sandy
 Lectus and Enienae and through the land of the Perrhaebi.  Soon
 you came to Iolcus and set foot on Cenaeum in Euboea, famed for
 ships: you stood in the Lelantine plain, but it pleased not your
 heart to make a temple there and wooded groves.  From there you
 crossed the Euripus, far-shooting Apollo, and went up the green,
 holy hills, going on to Mycalessus and grassy-bedded Teumessus,
 and so came to the wood-clad abode of Thebe; for as yet no man
 lived in holy Thebe, nor were there tracks or ways about Thebe's
 wheat-bearing plain as yet.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 229-238) And further still you went, O far-shooting Apollo,
 and came to Onchestus, Poseidon's bright grove: there the new-
 broken cold distressed with drawing the trim chariot gets spirit
 again, and the skilled driver springs from his car and goes on
 his way.  Then the horses for a while rattle the empty car, being
 rid of guidance; and if they break the chariot in the woody
 grove, men look after the horses, but tilt the chariot and leave
 it there; for this was the rite from the very first.  And the
 drivers pray to the lord of the shrine; but the chariot falls to
 the lot of the god.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 239-243) Further yet you went, O far-shooting Apollo, and
 reached next Cephissus' sweet stream which pours forth its sweet-
 flowing water from Lilaea, and crossing over it, O worker from
 afar, you passed many-towered Ocalea and reached grassy
 Haliartus.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 244-253) Then you went towards Telphusa: and there the
 pleasant place seemed fit for making a temple and wooded grove. 
 You came very near and spoke to her: `Telphusa, here I am minded
 to make a glorious temple, an oracle for men, and hither they
 will always bring perfect hecatombs, both those who live in rich
 Peloponnesus and those of Europe and all the wave-washed isles,
 coming to seek oracles.  And I will deliver to them all counsel
 that cannot fail, giving answer in my rich temple.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 254-276) So said Phoebus Apollo, and laid out all the
 foundations throughout, wide and very long.  But when Telphusa
 saw this, she was angry in heart and spoke, saying: `Lord
 Phoebus, worker from afar, I will speak a word of counsel to your
 heart, since you are minded to make here a glorious temple to be
 an oracle for men who will always bring hither perfect hecatombs
 for you; yet I will speak out, and do you lay up my words in your
 heart.  The trampling of swift horses and the sound of mules
 watering at my sacred springs will always irk you, and men will
 like better to gaze at the well-made chariots and stamping,
 swift-footed horses than at your great temple and the many
 treasures that are within.  But if you will be moved by me -- for
 you, lord, are stronger and mightier than I, and your strength is
 very great -- build at Crisa below the glades of Parnassus: there
 no bright chariot will clash, and there will be no noise of
 swift-footed horses near your well-built altar.  But so the
 glorious tribes of men will bring gifts to you as Iepaeon (`Hail-
 Healer'), and you will receive with delight rich sacrifices from
 the people dwelling round about.'  So said Telphusa, that she
 alone, and not the Far-Shooter, should have renown there; and she
 persuaded the Far-Shooter.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 277-286) Further yet you went, far-shooting Apollo, until
 you came to the town of the presumptuous Phlegyae who dwell on
 this earth in a lovely glade near the Cephisian lake, caring not
 for Zeus.  And thence you went speeding swiftly to the mountain
 ridge, and came to Crisa beneath snowy Parnassus, a foothill
 turned towards the west: a cliff hangs over if from above, and a
 hollow, rugged glade runs under.  There the lord Phoebus Apollo
 resolved to make his lovely temple, and thus he said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 287-293) `In this place I am minded to build a glorious
 temple to be an oracle for men, and here they will always bring
 perfect hecatombs, both they who dwell in rich Peloponnesus and
 the men of Europe and from all the wave-washed isles, coming to
 question me.  And I will deliver to them all counsel that cannot
 fail, answering them in my rich temple.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 294-299) When he had said this, Phoebus Apollo laid out all
 the foundations throughout, wide and very long; and upon these
 the sons of Erginus, Trophonius and Agamedes, dear to the
 deathless gods, laid a footing of stone.  And the countless
 tribes of men built the whole temple of wrought stones, to be
 sung of for ever.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 300-310) But near by was a sweet flowing spring, and there
 with his strong bow the lord, the son of Zeus, killed the
 bloated, great she-dragon, a fierce monster wont to do great
 mischief to men upon earth, to men themselves and to their thin-
 shanked sheep; for she was a very bloody plague.  She it was who
 once received from gold-throned Hera and brought up fell, cruel
 Typhaon to be a plague to men.  Once on a time Hera bare him
 because she was angry with father Zeus, when the Son of Cronos
 bare all-glorious Athena in his head.  Thereupon queenly Hera was
 angry and spoke thus among the assembled gods:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 311-330) `Hear from me, all gods and goddesses, how cloud-
 gathering Zeus begins to dishonour me wantonly, when he has made
 me his true-hearted wife.  See now, apart from me he has given
 birth to bright-eyed Athena who is foremost among all the blessed
 gods.  But my son Hephaestus whom I bare was weakly among all the
 blessed gods and shrivelled of foot, a shame and disgrace to me
 in heaven, whom I myself took in my hands and cast out so that he
 fell in the great sea.  But silver-shod Thetis the daughter of
 Nereus took and cared for him with her sisters: would that she
 had done other service to the blessed gods!  O wicked one and
 crafty!  What else will you now devise?  How dared you by
 yourself give birth to bright-eyed Athena?  Would not I have
 borne you a child -- I, who was at least called your wife among
 the undying gods who hold wide heaven.  Beware now lest I devise
 some evil thing for you hereafter: yes, now I will contrive that
 a son be born me to be foremost among the undying gods -- and
 that without casting shame on the holy bond of wedlock between
 you and me.  And I will not come to your bed, but will consort
 with the blessed gods far off from you.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 331-333) When she had so spoken, she went apart from the
 gods, being very angry.  Then straightway large-eyed queenly Hera
 prayed, striking the ground flatwise with her hand, and speaking
 thus:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 334-362) `Hear now, I pray, Earth and wide Heaven above, and
 you Titan gods who dwell beneath the earth about great Tartarus,
 and from whom are sprung both gods and men!  Harken you now to
 me, one and all, and grant that I may bear a child apart from
 Zeus, no wit lesser than him in strength -- nay, let him be as
 much stronger than Zeus as all-seeing Zeus than Cronos.'  Thus
 she cried and lashed the earth with her strong hand.  Then the
 life-giving earth was moved: and when Hera saw it she was glad in
 heart, for she thought her prayer would be fulfilled.  And
 thereafter she never came to the bed of wise Zeus for a full
 year, not to sit in her carved chair as aforetime to plan wise
 counsel for him, but stayed in her temples where many pray, and
 delighted in her offerings, large-eyed queenly Hera.  But when
 the months and days were fulfilled and the seasons duly came on
 as the earth moved round, she bare one neither like the gods nor
 mortal men, fell, cruel Typhaon, to be a plague to men. 
 Straightway large-eyed queenly Hera took him and bringing one
 evil thing to another such, gave him to the dragoness; and she
 received him.  And this Typhaon used to work great mischief among
 the famous tribes of men.  Whosoever met the dragoness, the day
 of doom would sweep him away, until the lord Apollo, who deals
 death from afar, shot a strong arrow at her.  Then she, rent with
 bitter pangs, lay drawing great gasps for breath and rolling
 about that place.  An awful noise swelled up unspeakable as she
 writhed continually this way and that amid the wood: and so she
 left her life, breathing it forth in blood.  Then Phoebus Apollo
 boasted over her:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 363-369) `Now rot here upon the soil that feeds man!  You at
 least shall live no more to be a fell bane to men who eat the
 fruit of the all-nourishing earth, and who will bring hither
 perfect hecatombs.  Against cruel death neither Typhoeus shall
 avail you nor ill-famed Chimera, but here shall the Earth and
 shining Hyperion make you rot.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 370-374) Thus said Phoebus, exulting over her: and darkness
 covered her eyes.  And the holy strength of Helios made her rot
 away there; wherefore the place is now called Pytho, and men call
 the lord Apollo by another name, Pythian; because on that spot
 the power of piercing Helios made the monster rot away.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 375-378) Then Phoebus Apollo saw that the sweet-flowing
 spring had beguiled him, and he started out in anger against
 Telphusa; and soon coming to her, he stood close by and spoke to
 her:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 379-381) `Telphusa, you were not, after all, to keep to
 yourself this lovely place by deceiving my mind, and pour forth
 your clear flowing water: here my renown shall also be and not
 yours alone?'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 382-387) Thus spoke the lord, far-working Apollo, and pushed
 over upon her a crag with a shower of rocks, hiding her streams:
 and he made himself an altar in a wooded grove very near the
 clear-flowing stream.  In that place all men pray to the great
 one by the name Telphusian, because he humbled the stream of holy
 Telphusa.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 388-439) Then Phoebus Apollo pondered in his heart what men
 he should bring in to be his ministers in sacrifice and to serve
 him in rocky Pytho.  And while he considered this, he became
 aware of a swift ship upon the wine-like sea in which were many
 men and goodly, Cretans from Cnossos (10), the city of Minos,
 they who do sacrifice to the prince and announce his decrees,
 whatsoever Phoebus Apollo, bearer of the golden blade, speaks in
 answer from his laurel tree below the dells of Parnassus.  These
 men were sailing in their black ship for traffic and for profit
 to sandy Pylos and to the men of Pylos.  But Phoebus Apollo met
 them: in the open sea he sprang upon their swift ship, like a
 dolphin in shape, and lay there, a great and awesome monster, and
 none of them gave heed so as to understand (11); but they sought
 to cast the dolphin overboard.  But he kept shaking the black
 ship every way and make the timbers quiver.  So they sat silent
 in their craft for fear, and did not loose the sheets throughout
 the black, hollow ship, nor lowered the sail of their dark-prowed
 vessel, but as they had set it first of all with oxhide ropes, so
 they kept sailing on; for a rushing south wind hurried on the
 swift ship from behind.  First they passed by Malea, and then
 along the Laconian coast they came to Taenarum, sea-garlanded
 town and country of Helios who gladdens men, where the thick-
 fleeced sheep of the lord Helios feed continually and occupy a
 glad-some country.  There they wished to put their ship to shore,
 and land and comprehend the great marvel and see with their eyes
 whether the monster would remain upon the deck of the hollow
 ship, or spring back into the briny deep where fishes shoal.  But
 the well-built ship would not obey the helm, but went on its way
 all along Peloponnesus: and the lord, far-working Apollo, guided
 it easily with the breath of the breeze.  So the ship ran on its
 course and came to Arena and lovely Argyphea and Thryon, the ford
 of Alpheus, and well-placed Aepy and sandy Pylos and the men of
 Pylos; past Cruni it went and Chalcis and past Dyme and fair
 Elis, where the Epei rule.  And at the time when she was making
 for Pherae, exulting in the breeze from Zeus, there appeared to
 them below the clouds the steep mountain of Ithaca, and Dulichium
 and Same and wooded Zacynthus.  But when they were passed by all
 the coast of Peloponnesus, then, towards Crisa, that vast gulf
 began to heave in sight which through all its length cuts off the
 rich isle of Pelops.  There came on them a strong, clear west-
 wind by ordinance of Zeus and blew from heaven vehemently, that
 with all speed the ship might finish coursing over the briny
 water of the sea.  So they began again to voyage back towards the
 dawn and the sun: and the lord Apollo, son of Zeus, led them on
 until they reached far-seen Crisa, land of vines, and into haven:
 there the sea-coursing ship grounded on the sands.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 440-451) Then, like a star at noonday, the lord, far-working
 Apollo, leaped from the ship: flashes of fire flew from him thick
 and their brightness reached to heaven.  He entered into his
 shrine between priceless tripods, and there made a flame to flare
 up bright, showing forth the splendour of his shafts, so that
 their radiance filled all Crisa, and the wives and well-girded
 daughters of the Crisaeans raised a cry at that outburst of
 Phoebus; for he cast great fear upon them all.  From his shrine
 he sprang forth again, swift as a thought, to speed again to the
 ship, bearing the form of a man, brisk and sturdy, in the prime
 of his youth, while his broad shoulders were covered with his
 hair: and he spoke to the Cretans, uttering winged words:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 452-461) `Strangers, who are you?  Whence come you sailing
 along the paths of the sea?  Are you for traffic, or do you
 wander at random over the sea as pirates do who put their own
 lives to hazard and bring mischief to men of foreign parts as
 they roam?  Why rest you so and are afraid, and do not go ashore
 nor stow the gear of your black ship?  For that is the custom of
 men who live by bread, whenever they come to land in their dark
 ships from the main, spent with toil; at once desire for sweet
 food catches them about the heart.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 462-473) So speaking, he put courage in their hearts, and
 the master of the Cretans answered him and said: `Stranger --
 though you are nothing like mortal men in shape or stature, but
 are as the deathless gods -- hail and all happiness to you, and
 may the gods give you good.  Now tell me truly that I may surely
 know it: what country is this, and what land, and what men live
 herein?  As for us, with thoughts set otherwards, we were sailing
 over the great sea to Pylos from Crete (for from there we declare
 that we are sprung), but now are come on shipboard to this place
 by no means willingly -- another way and other paths -- and
 gladly would we return.  But one of the deathless gods brought us
 here against our will.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 474-501) Then far-working Apollo answered then and said:
 `Strangers who once dwelt about wooded Cnossos but now shall
 return no more each to his loved city and fair house and dear
 wife; here shall you keep my rich temple that is honoured by many
 men.  I am the son of Zeus; Apollo is my name: but you I brought
 here over the wide gulf of the sea, meaning you no hurt; nay,
 here you shall keep my rich temple that is greatly honoured among
 men, and you shall know the plans of the deathless gods, and by
 their will you shall be honoured continually for all time.  And
 now come, make haste and do as I say.  First loose the sheets and
 lower the sail, and then draw the swift ship up upon the land. 
 Take out your goods and the gear of the straight ship, and make
 an altar upon the beach of the sea: light fire upon it and make
 an offering of white meal.  Next, stand side by side around the
 altar and pray: and in as much as at the first on the hazy sea I
 sprang upon the swift ship in the form of a dolphin, pray to me
 as Apollo Delphinius; also the altar itself shall be called
 Delphinius and overlooking (12) for ever.  Afterwards, sup beside
 your dark ship and pour an offering to the blessed gods who dwell
 on Olympus.  But when you have put away craving for sweet food,
 come with me singing the hymn Ie Paean (Hail, Healer!), until you
 come to the place where you shall keep my rich temple.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 502-523) So said Apollo.  And they readily harkened to him
 and obeyed him.  First they unfastened the sheets and let down
 the sail and lowered the mast by the forestays upon the mast-
 rest.  Then, landing upon the beach of the sea, they hauled up
 the ship from the water to dry land and fixed long stays under
 it.  Also they made an altar upon the beach of the sea, and when
 they had lit a fire, made an offering of white meal, and prayed
 standing around the altar as Apollo had bidden them.  Then they
 took their meal by the swift, black ship, and poured an offering
 to the blessed gods who dwell on Olympus.  And when they had put
 away craving for drink and food, they started out with the lord
 Apollo, the son of Zeus, to lead them, holding a lyre in his
 hands, and playing sweetly as he stepped high and featly.  So the
 Cretans followed him to Pytho, marching in time as they chanted
 the Ie Paean after the manner of the Cretan paean-singers and of
 those in whose hearts the heavenly Muse has put sweet-voiced
 song.  With tireless feet they approached the ridge and
 straightway came to Parnassus and the lovely place where they
 were to dwell honoured by many men.  There Apollo brought them
 and showed them his most holy sanctuary and rich temple.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 524-525) But their spirit was stirred in their dear breasts,
 and the master of the Cretans asked him, saying:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 526-530) `Lord, since you have brought us here far from our
 dear ones and our fatherland, -- for so it seemed good to your
 heart, -- tell us now how we shall live.  That we would know of
 you.  This land is not to be desired either for vineyards or for
 pastures so that we can live well thereon and also minister to
 men.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 531-544) Then Apollo, the son of Zeus, smiled upon them and
 said: `Foolish mortals and poor drudges are you, that you seek
 cares and hard toils and straits!  Easily will I tell you a word
 and set it in your hearts.  Though each one of you with knife in
 hand should slaughter sheep continually, yet would you always
 have abundant store, even all that the glorious tribes of men
 bring here for me.  But guard you my temple and receive the
 tribes of men that gather to this place, and especially show
 mortal men my will, and do you keep righteousness in your heart. 
 But if any shall be disobedient and pay no heed to my warning, of
 if there shall be any idle word or deed and outrage as is common
 among mortal men, then other men shall be your masters and with a
 strong hand shall make you subject for ever.  All has been told
 you: do you keep it in your heart.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 545-546) And so, farewell, son of Zeus and Leto; but I will
 remember you and another hymn also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IV. TO HERMES (582 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-29) Muse, sing of Hermes, the son of Zeus and Maia, lord
 of Cyllene and Arcadia rich in flocks, the luck-bringing
 messenger of the immortals whom Maia bare, the rich-tressed
 nymph, when she was joined in love with Zeus, -- a shy goddess,
 for she avoided the company of the blessed gods, and lived within
 a deep, shady cave.  There the son of Cronos used to lie with the
 rich-tressed nymph, unseen by deathless gods and mortal men, at
 dead of night while sweet sleep should hold white-armed Hera
 fast.  And when the purpose of great Zeus was fixed in heaven,
 she was delivered and a notable thing was come to pass.  For then
 she bare a son, of many shifts, blandly cunning, a robber, a
 cattle driver, a bringer of dreams, a watcher by night, a thief
 at the gates, one who was soon to show forth wonderful deeds
 among the deathless gods.  Born with the dawning, at mid-day he
 played on the lyre, and in the evening he stole the cattle of
 far-shooting Apollo on the fourth day of the month; for on that
 day queenly Maia bare him.  So soon as he had leaped from his
 mother's heavenly womb, he lay not long waiting in his holy
 cradle, but he sprang up and sought the oxen of Apollo.  But as
 he stepped over the threshold of the high-roofed cave, he found a
 tortoise there and gained endless delight.  For it was Hermes who
 first made the tortoise a singer.  The creature fell in his way
 at the courtyard gate, where it was feeding on the rich grass
 before the dwelling, waddling along.  When be saw it, the luck-
 bringing son of Zeus laughed and said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 30-38) `An omen of great luck for me so soon!  I do not
 slight it.  Hail, comrade of the feast, lovely in shape, sounding
 at the dance!  With joy I meet you!  Where got you that rich gaud
 for covering, that spangled shell -- a tortoise living in the
 mountains?  But I will take and carry you within: you shall help
 me and I will do you no disgrace, though first of all you must
 profit me.  It is better to be at home: harm may come out of
 doors.  Living, you shall be a spell against mischievous
 witchcraft (13); but if you die, then you shall make sweetest
 song.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 39-61) Thus speaking, he took up the tortoise in both hands
 and went back into the house carrying his charming toy.  Then he
 cut off its limbs and scooped out the marrow of the mountain-
 tortoise with a scoop of grey iron.  As a swift thought darts
 through the heart of a man when thronging cares haunt him, or as
 bright glances flash from the eye, so glorious Hermes planned
 both thought and deed at once.  He cut stalks of reed to measure
 and fixed them, fastening their ends across the back and through
 the shell of the tortoise, and then stretched ox hide all over it
 by his skill.  Also he put in the horns and fitted a cross-piece
 upon the two of them, and stretched seven strings of sheep-gut. 
 But when he had made it he proved each string in turn with the
 key, as he held the lovely thing.  At the touch of his hand it
 sounded marvellously; and, as he tried it, the god sang sweet
 random snatches, even as youths bandy taunts at festivals.  He
 sang of Zeus the son of Cronos and neat-shod Maia, the converse
 which they had before in the comradeship of love, telling all the
 glorious tale of his own begetting.  He celebrated, too, the
 handmaids of the nymph, and her bright home, and the tripods all
 about the house, and the abundant cauldrons.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 62-67) But while he was singing of all these, his heart was
 bent on other matters.  And he took the hollow lyre and laid it
 in his sacred cradle, and sprang from the sweet-smelling hall to
 a watch-place, pondering sheet trickery in his heart -- deeds
 such as knavish folk pursue in the dark night-time; for he longed
 to taste flesh.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 68-86) The Sun was going down beneath the earth towards
 Ocean with his horses and chariot when Hermes came hurrying to
 the shadowy mountains of Pieria, where the divine cattle of the
 blessed gods had their steads and grazed the pleasant, unmown
 meadows.  Of these the Son of Maia, the sharp-eyed slayer of
 Argus then cut off from the herd fifty loud-lowing kine, and
 drove them straggling-wise across a sandy place, turning their
 hoof-prints aside.  Also, he bethought him of a crafty ruse and
 reversed the marks of their hoofs, making the front behind and
 the hind before, while he himself walked the other way (14). 
 Then he wove sandals with wicker-work by the sand of the sea,
 wonderful things, unthought of, unimagined; for he mixed together
 tamarisk and myrtle-twigs, fastening together an armful of their
 fresh, young wood, and tied them, leaves and all securely under
 his feet as light sandals.  The brushwood the glorious Slayer of
 Argus plucked in Pieria as he was preparing for his journey,
 making shift (15) as one making haste for a long journey.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 87-89) But an old man tilling his flowering vineyard saw him
 as he was hurrying down the plain through grassy Onchestus.  So
 the Son of Maia began and said to him:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 90-93) `Old man, digging about your vines with bowed
 shoulders, surely you shall have much wine when all these bear
 fruit, if you obey me and strictly remember not to have seen what
 you have seen, and not to have heard what you have heard, and to
 keep silent when nothing of your own is harmed.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 94-114) When he had said this much, he hurried the strong
 cattle on together: through many shadowy mountains and echoing
 gorges and flowery plains glorious Hermes drove them.  And now
 the divine night, his dark ally, was mostly passed, and dawn that
 sets folk to work was quickly coming on, while bright Selene,
 daughter of the lord Pallas, Megamedes' son, had just climbed her
 watch-post, when the strong Son of Zeus drove the wide-browed
 cattle of Phoebus Apollo to the river Alpheus.  And they came
 unwearied to the high-roofed byres and the drinking-troughs that
 were before the noble meadow.  Then, after he had well-fed the
 loud-bellowing cattle with fodder and driven them into the byre,
 close-packed and chewing lotus and began to seek the art of fire.
 </p><p>
 He chose a stout laurel branch and trimmed it with the knife....
 ((LACUNA)) (16)
 ....held firmly in his hand: and the hot smoke rose up.  For it
 was Hermes who first invented fire-sticks and fire.  Next he took
 many dried sticks and piled them thick and plenty in a sunken
 trench: and flame began to glow, spreading afar the blast of
 fierce-burning fire.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 115-137) And while the strength of glorious Hephaestus was
 beginning to kindle the fire, he dragged out two lowing, horned
 cows close to the fire; for great strength was with him.  He
 threw them both panting upon their backs on the ground, and
 rolled them on their sides, bending their necks over (17), and
 pierced their vital chord.  Then he went on from task to task:
 first he cut up the rich, fatted meat, and pierced it with wooden
 spits, and roasted flesh and the honourable chine and the paunch
 full of dark blood all together.  He laid them there upon the
 ground, and spread out the hides on a rugged rock: and so they
 are still there many ages afterwards, a long, long time after all
 this, and are continually (18).  Next glad-hearted Hermes dragged
 the rich meats he had prepared and put them on a smooth, flat
 stone, and divided them into twelve portions distributed by lot,
 making each portion wholly honourable.  Then glorious Hermes
 longed for the sacrificial meat, for the sweet savour wearied
 him, god though he was; nevertheless his proud heart was not
 prevailed upon to devour the flesh, although he greatly desired
 (19).  But he put away the fat and all the flesh in the high-
 roofed byre, placing them high up to be a token of his youthful
 theft.  And after that he gathered dry sticks and utterly
 destroyed with fire all the hoofs and all the heads.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 138-154) And when the god had duly finished all, he threw
 his sandals into deep-eddying Alpheus, and quenched the embers,
 covering the black ashes with sand, and so spent the night while
 Selene's soft light shone down.  Then the god went straight back
 again at dawn to the bright crests of Cyllene, and no one met him
 on the long journey either of the blessed gods or mortal men, nor
 did any dog bark.  And luck-bringing Hermes, the son of Zeus,
 passed edgeways through the key-hole of the hall like the autumn
 breeze, even as mist: straight through the cave he went and came
 to the rich inner chamber, walking softly, and making no noise as
 one might upon the floor.  Then glorious Hermes went hurriedly to
 his cradle, wrapping his swaddling clothes about his shoulders as
 though he were a feeble babe, and lay playing with the covering
 about his knees; but at his left hand he kept close his sweet
 lyre.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 155-161) But the god did not pass unseen by the goddess his
 mother; but she said to him: `How now, you rogue!  Whence come
 you back so at night-time, you that wear shamelessness as a
 garment?  And now I surely believe the son of Leto will soon have
 you forth out of doors with unbreakable cords about your ribs, or
 you will live a rogue's life in the glens robbing by whiles.  Go
 to, then; your father got you to be a great worry to mortal men
 and deathless gods.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 162-181) Then Hermes answered her with crafty words:
 `Mother, why do you seek to frighten me like a feeble child whose
 heart knows few words of blame, a fearful babe that fears its
 mother's scolding?  Nay, but I will try whatever plan is best,
 and so feed myself and you continually.  We will not be content
 to remain here, as you bid, alone of all the gods unfee'd with
 offerings and prayers.  Better to live in fellowship with the
 deathless gods continually, rich, wealthy, and enjoying stories
 of grain, than to sit always in a gloomy cave: and, as regards
 honour, I too will enter upon the rite that Apollo has.  If my
 father will not give it to me, I will seek -- and I am able -- to
 be a prince of robbers.  And if Leto's most glorious son shall
 seek me out, I think another and a greater loss will befall him. 
 For I will go to Pytho to break into his great house, and will
 plunder therefrom splendid tripods, and cauldrons, and gold, and
 plenty of bright iron, and much apparel; and you shall see it if
 you will.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 182-189) With such words they spoke together, the son of
 Zeus who holds the aegis, and the lady Maia.  Now Eros the early
 born was rising from deep-flowing Ocean, bringing light to men,
 when Apollo, as he went, came to Onchestus, the lovely grove and
 sacred place of the loud-roaring Holder of the Earth.  There he
 found an old man grazing his beast along the pathway from his
 court-yard fence, and the all-glorious Son of Leto began and said
 to him.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 190-200) `Old man, weeder (20) of grassy Onchestus, I am
 come here from Pieria seeking cattle, cows all of them, all with
 curving horns, from my herd.  The black bull was grazing alone
 away from the rest, but fierce-eyed hounds followed the cows,
 four of them, all of one mind, like men.  These were left behind,
 the dogs and the bull -- which is great marvel; but the cows
 strayed out of the soft meadow, away from the pasture when the
 sun was just going down.  Now tell me this, old man born long
 ago: have you seen one passing along behind those cows?'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 201-211) Then the old man answered him and said: `My son, it
 is hard to tell all that one's eyes see; for many wayfarers pass
 to and fro this way, some bent on much evil, and some on good: it
 is difficult to know each one.  However, I was digging about my
 plot of vineyard all day long until the sun went down, and I
 thought, good sir, but I do not know for certain, that I marked a
 child, whoever the child was, that followed long-horned cattle --
 an infant who had a staff and kept walking from side to side: he
 was driving them backwards way, with their heads toward him.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 212-218) So said the old man.  And when Apollo heard this
 report, he went yet more quickly on his way, and presently,
 seeing a long-winged bird, he knew at once by that omen that
 thief was the child of Zeus the son of Cronos.  So the lord
 Apollo, son of Zeus, hurried on to goodly Pylos seeking his
 shambling oxen, and he had his broad shoulders covered with a
 dark cloud.  But when the Far-Shooter perceived the tracks, he
 cried:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 219-226) `Oh, oh!  Truly this is a great marvel that my eyes
 behold!  These are indeed the tracks of straight-horned oxen, but
 they are turned backwards towards the flowery meadow.  But these
 others are not the footprints of man or woman or grey wolves or
 bears or lions, nor do I think they are the tracks of a rough-
 maned Centaur -- whoever it be that with swift feet makes such
 monstrous footprints; wonderful are the tracks on this side of
 the way, but yet more wonderfully are those on that.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 227-234) When he had so said, the lord Apollo, the Son of
 Zeus hastened on and came to the forest-clad mountain of Cyllene
 and the deep-shadowed cave in the rock where the divine nymph
 brought forth the child of Zeus who is the son of Cronos.  A
 sweet odour spread over the lovely hill, and many thin-shanked
 sheep were grazing on the grass.  Then far-shooting Apollo
 himself stepped down in haste over the stone threshold into the
 dusky cave.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 235-253) Now when the Son of Zeus and Maia saw Apollo in a
 rage about his cattle, he snuggled down in his fragrant
 swaddling-clothes; and as wood-ash covers over the deep embers of
 tree-stumps, so Hermes cuddled himself up when he saw the Far-
 Shooter.  He squeezed head and hands and feet together in a small
 space, like a new born child seeking sweet sleep, though in truth
 he was wide awake, and he kept his lyre under his armpit.  But
 the Son of Leto was aware and failed not to perceive the
 beautiful mountain-nymph and her dear son, albeit a little child
 and swathed so craftily.  He peered in ever corner of the great
 dwelling and, taking a bright key, he opened three closets full
 of nectar and lovely ambrosia.  And much gold and silver was
 stored in them, and many garments of the nymph, some purple and
 some silvery white, such as are kept in the sacred houses of the
 blessed gods.  Then, after the Son of Leto had searched out the
 recesses of the great house, he spake to glorious Hermes:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 254-259) `Child, lying in the cradle, make haste and tell me
 of my cattle, or we two will soon fall out angrily.  For I will
 take and cast you into dusty Tartarus and awful hopeless
 darkness, and neither your mother nor your father shall free you
 or bring you up again to the light, but you will wander under the
 earth and be the leader amongst little folk.' (21)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 260-277) Then Hermes answered him with crafty words: `Son of
 Leto, what harsh words are these you have spoken?  And is it
 cattle of the field you are come here to seek?  I have not seen
 them: I have not heard of them: no one has told me of them.  I
 cannot give news of them, nor win the reward for news.  Am I like
 a cattle-liter, a stalwart person?  This is no task for me:
 rather I care for other things: I care for sleep, and milk of my
 mother's breast, and wrappings round my shoulders, and warm
 baths.  Let no one hear the cause of this dispute; for this would
 be a great marvel indeed among the deathless gods, that a child
 newly born should pass in through the forepart of the house with
 cattle of the field: herein you speak extravagantly.  I was born
 yesterday, and my feet are soft and the ground beneath is rough;
 nevertheless, if you will have it so, I will swear a great oath
 by my father's head and vow that neither am I guilty myself,
 neither have I seen any other who stole your cows -- whatever
 cows may be; for I know them only by hearsay.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 278-280) So, then, said Hermes, shooting quick glances from
 his eyes: and he kept raising his brows and looking this way and
 that, whistling long and listening to Apollo's story as to an
 idle tale.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 281-292) But far-working Apollo laughed softly and said to
 him: `O rogue, deceiver, crafty in heart, you talk so innocently
 that I most surely believe that you have broken into many a well-
 built house and stripped more than one poor wretch bare this
 night (22), gathering his goods together all over the house
 without noise.  You will plague many a lonely herdsman in
 mountain glades, when you come on herds and thick-fleeced sheep,
 and have a hankering after flesh.  But come now, if you would not
 sleep your last and latest sleep, get out of your cradle, you
 comrade of dark night.  Surely hereafter this shall be your title
 amongst the deathless gods, to be called the prince of robbers
 continually.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 293-300) So said Phoebus Apollo, and took the child and
 began to carry him.  But at that moment the strong Slayer of
 Argus had his plan, and, while Apollo held him in his hands, sent
 forth an omen, a hard-worked belly-serf, a rude messenger, and
 sneezed directly after.  And when Apollo heard it, he dropped
 glorious Hermes out of his hands on the ground: then sitting down
 before him, though he was eager to go on his way, he spoke
 mockingly to Hermes:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 301-303) `Fear not, little swaddling baby, son of Zeus and
 Maia.  I shall find the strong cattle presently by these omens,
 and you shall lead the way.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 304-306) When Apollo had so said, Cyllenian Hermes sprang up
 quickly, starting in haste.  With both hands he pushed up to his
 ears the covering that he had wrapped about his shoulders, and
 said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 307-312) `Where are you carrying me, Far-Worker, hastiest of
 all the gods?  Is it because of your cattle that you are so angry
 and harass me?  O dear, would that all the sort of oxen might
 perish; for it is not I who stole your cows, nor did I see
 another steal them -- whatever cows may be, and of that I have
 only heard report.  Nay, give right and take it before Zeus, the
 Son of Cronos.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 313-326) So Hermes the shepherd and Leto's glorious son kept
 stubbornly disputing each article of their quarrel: Apollo,
 speaking truly....
 ((LACUNA))
 ....not fairly sought to seize glorious Hermes because of the
 cows; but he, the Cyllenian, tried to deceive the God of the
 Silver Bow with tricks and cunning words.  But when, though he
 had many wiles, he found the other had as many shifts, he began
 to walk across the sand, himself in front, while the Son of Zeus
 and Leto came behind.  Soon they came, these lovely children of
 Zeus, to the top of fragrant Olympus, to their father, the Son of
 Cronos; for there were the scales of judgement set for them both.
 </p><p>
 There was an assembly on snowy Olympus, and the immortals who
 perish not were gathering after the hour of gold-throned Dawn.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 327-329) Then Hermes and Apollo of the Silver Bow stood at
 the knees of Zeus: and Zeus who thunders on high spoke to his
 glorious son and asked him:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 330-332) `Phoebus, whence come you driving this great spoil,
 a child new born that has the look of a herald?  This is a
 weighty matter that is come before the council of the gods.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 333-364) Then the lord, far-working Apollo, answered him: `O
 my father, you shall soon hear no triffling tale though you
 reproach me that I alone am fond of spoil.  Here is a child, a
 burgling robber, whom I found after a long journey in the hills
 of Cyllene: for my part I have never seen one so pert either
 among the gods or all men that catch folk unawares throughout the
 world.  He strole away my cows from their meadow and drove them
 off in the evening along the shore of the loud-roaring sea,
 making straight for Pylos.  There were double tracks, and
 wonderful they were, such as one might marvel at, the doing of a
 clever sprite; for as for the cows, the dark dust kept and showed
 their footprints leading towards the flowery meadow; but he
 himself -- bewildering creature -- crossed the sandy ground
 outside the path, not on his feet nor yet on his hands; but,
 furnished with some other means he trudged his way -- wonder of
 wonders! -- as though one walked on slender oak-trees.  Now while
 he followed the cattle across sandy ground, all the tracks showed
 quite clearly in the dust; but when he had finished the long way
 across the sand, presently the cows' track and his own could not
 be traced over the hard ground.  But a mortal man noticed him as
 he drove the wide-browed kine straight towards Pylos.  And as
 soon as he had shut them up quietly, and had gone home by crafty
 turns and twists, he lay down in his cradle in the gloom of a dim
 cave, as still as dark night, so that not even an eagle keenly
 gazing would have spied him.  Much he rubbed his eyes with his
 hands as he prepared falsehood, and himself straightway said
 roundly: "I have not seen them: I have not heard of them: no man
 has told me of them.  I could not tell you of them, nor win the
 reward of telling."'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 365-367) When he had so spoken, Phoebus Apollo sat down. 
 But Hermes on his part answered and said, pointing at the Son of
 Cronos, the lord of all the gods:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 368-386) `Zeus, my father, indeed I will speak truth to you;
 for I am truthful and I cannot tell a lie.  He came to our house
 to-day looking for his shambling cows, as the sun was newly
 rising.  He brought no witnesses with him nor any of the blessed
 gods who had seen the theft, but with great violence ordered me
 to confess, threatening much to throw me into wide Tartarus.  For
 he has the rich bloom of glorious youth, while I was born but
 yesterday -- as he too knows -- nor am I like a cattle-lifter, a
 sturdy fellow.  Believe my tale (for you claim to be my own
 father), that I did not drive his cows to my house -- so may I
 prosper -- nor crossed the threshold: this I say truly.  I
 reverence Helios greatly and the other gods, and you I love and
 him I dread.  You yourself know that I am not guilty: and I will
 swear a great oath upon it: -- No! by these rich-decked porticoes
 of the gods.  And some day I will punish him, strong as he is,
 for this pitiless inquisition; but now do you help the younger.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 387-396) So spake the Cyllenian, the Slayer of Argus, while
 he kept shooting sidelong glances and kept his swaddling-clothes
 upon his arm, and did not cast them away.  But Zeus laughed out
 loud to see his evil-plotting child well and cunningly denying
 guilt about the cattle.  And he bade them both to be of one mind
 and search for the cattle, and guiding Hermes to lead the way
 and, without mischievousness of heart, to show the place where
 now he had hidden the strong cattle.  Then the Son of Cronos
 bowed his head: and goodly Hermes obeyed him; for the will of
 Zeus who holds the aegis easily prevailed with him.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 397-404) Then the two all-glorious children of Zeus hastened
 both to sandy Pylos, and reached the ford of Alpheus, and came to
 the fields and the high-roofed byre where the beasts were
 cherished at night-time.  Now while Hermes went to the cave in
 the rock and began to drive out the strong cattle, the son of
 Leto, looking aside, saw the cowhides on the sheer rock.  And he
 asked glorious Hermes at once:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 405-408) `How were you able, you crafty rogue, to flay two
 cows, new-born and babyish as you are?  For my part, I dread the
 strength that will be yours: there is no need you should keep
 growing long, Cyllenian, son of Maia!'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 409-414) So saying, Apollo twisted strong withes with his
 hands meaning to bind Hermes with firm bands; but the bands would
 not hold him, and the withes of osier fell far from him and began
 to grow at once from the ground beneath their feet in that very
 place.  And intertwining with one another, they quickly grew and
 covered all the wild-roving cattle by the will of thievish
 Hermes, so that Apollo was astonished as he gazed.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 414-435) Then the strong slayer of Argus looked furtively
 upon the ground with eyes flashing fire.... desiring to hide....
 ((LACUNA))
 ....Very easily he softened the son of all-glorious Leto as he
 would, stern though the Far-shooter was.  He took the lyre upon
 his left arm and tried each string in turn with the key, so that
 it sounded awesomely at his touch.  And Phoebus Apollo laughed
 for joy; for the sweet throb of the marvellous music went to his
 heart, and a soft longing took hold on his soul as he listened. 
 Then the son of Maia, harping sweetly upon his lyre, took courage
 and stood at the left hand of Phoebus Apollo; and soon, while he
 played shrilly on his lyre, he lifted up his voice and sang, and
 lovely was the sound of his voice that followed.  He sang the
 story of the deathless gods and of the dark earth, how at the
 first they came to be, and how each one received his portion. 
 First among the gods he honoured Mnemosyne, mother of the Muses,
 in his song; for the son of Maia was of her following.  And next
 the goodly son of Zeus hymned the rest of the immortals according
 to their order in age, and told how each was born, mentioning all
 in order as he struck the lyre upon his arm.  But Apollo was
 seized with a longing not to be allayed, and he opened his mouth
 and spoke winged words to Hermes:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 436-462) `Slayer of oxen, trickster, busy one, comrade of
 the feast, this song of yours is worth fifty cows, and I believe
 that presently we shall settle our quarrel peacefully.  But come
 now, tell me this, resourceful son of Maia: has this marvellous
 thing been with you from your birth, or did some god or mortal
 man give it you -- a noble gift -- and teach you heavenly song? 
 For wonderful is this new-uttered sound I hear, the like of which
 I vow that no man nor god dwelling on Olympus ever yet has known
 but you, O thievish son of Maia.  What skill is this?  What song
 for desperate cares?  What way of song?  For verily here are
 three things to hand all at once from which to choose, -- mirth,
 and love, and sweet sleep.  And though I am a follower of the
 Olympian Muses who love dances and the bright path of song -- the
 full-toned chant and ravishing thrill of flutes -- yet I never
 cared for any of those feats of skill at young men's revels, as I
 do now for this: I am filled with wonder, O son of Zeus, at your
 sweet playing.  But now, since you, though little, have such
 glorious skill, sit down, dear boy, and respect the words of your
 elders.  For now you shall have renown among the deathless gods,
 you and your mother also.  This I will declare to you exactly: by
 this shaft of cornel wood I will surely make you a leader
 renowned among the deathless gods, and fortunate, and will give
 you glorious gifts and will not deceive you from first to last.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 463-495) Then Hermes answered him with artful words: `You
 question me carefully, O Far-worker; yet I am not jealous that
 you should enter upon my art: this day you shall know it.  For I
 seek to be friendly with you both in thought and word.  Now you
 well know all things in your heart, since you sit foremost among
 the deathless gods, O son of Zeus, and are goodly and strong. 
 And wise Zeus loves you as all right is, and has given you
 splendid gifts.  And they say that from the utterance of Zeus you
 have learned both the honours due to the gods, O Far-worker, and
 oracles from Zeus, even all his ordinances.  Of all these I
 myself have already learned that you have great wealth.  Now, you
 are free to learn whatever you please; but since, as it seems,
 your heart is so strongly set on playing the lyre, chant, and
 play upon it, and give yourself to merriment, taking this as a
 gift from me, and do you, my friend, bestow glory on me.  Sing
 well with this clear-voiced companion in your hands; for you are
 skilled in good, well-ordered utterance.  From now on bring it
 confidently to the rich feast and lovely dance and glorious
 revel, a joy by night and by day.  Whoso with wit and wisdom
 enquires of it cunningly, him it teaches through its sound all
 manner of things that delight the mind, being easily played with
 gentle familiarities, for it abhors toilsome drudgery; but whoso
 in ignorance enquires of it violently, to him it chatters mere
 vanity and foolishness.  But you are able to learn whatever you
 please.  So then, I will give you this lyre, glorious son of
 Zeus, while I for my part will graze down with wild-roving cattle
 the pastures on hill and horse-feeding plain: so shall the cows
 covered by the bulls calve abundantly both males and females. 
 And now there is no need for you, bargainer though you are, to be
 furiously angry.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 496-502) When Hermes had said this, he held out the lyre:
 and Phoebus Apollo took it, and readily put his shining whip in
 Hermes' hand, and ordained him keeper of herds.  The son of Maia
 received it joyfully, while the glorious son of Leto, the lord
 far-working Apollo, took the lyre upon his left arm and tried
 each string with the key.  Awesomely it sounded at the touch of
 the god, while he sang sweetly to its note.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 503-512) Afterwards they two, the all-glorious sons of Zeus
 turned the cows back towards the sacred meadow, but themselves
 hastened back to snowy Olympus, delighting in the lyre.  Then
 wise Zeus was glad and made them both friends.  And Hermes loved
 the son of Leto continually, even as he does now, when he had
 given the lyre as token to the Far-shooter, who played it
 skilfully, holding it upon his arm.  But for himself Hermes found
 out another cunning art and made himself the pipes whose sound is
 heard afar.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 513-520) Then the son of Leto said to Hermes: `Son of Maia,
 guide and cunning one, I fear you may steal form me the lyre and
 my curved bow together; for you have an office from Zeus, to
 establish deeds of barter amongst men throughout the fruitful
 earth.  Now if you would only swear me the great oath of the
 gods, either by nodding your head, or by the potent water of
 Styx, you would do all that can please and ease my heart.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 521-549) Then Maia's son nodded his head and promised that
 he would never steal anything of all the Far-shooter possessed,
 and would never go near his strong house; but Apollo, son of
 Leto, swore to be fellow and friend to Hermes, vowing that he
 would love no other among the immortals, neither god nor man
 sprung from Zeus, better than Hermes: and the Father sent forth
 an eagle in confirmation.  And Apollo sware also: `Verily I will
 make you only to be an omen for the immortals and all alike,
 trusted and honoured by my heart.  Moreover, I will give you a
 splendid staff of riches and wealth: it is of gold, with three
 branches, and will keep you scatheless, accomplishing every task,
 whether of words or deeds that are good, which I claim to know
 through the utterance of Zeus.  But as for sooth-saying, noble,
 heaven-born child, of which you ask, it is not lawful for you to
 learn it, nor for any other of the deathless gods: only the mind
 of Zeus knows that.  I am pledged and have vowed and sworn a
 strong oath that no other of the eternal gods save I should know
 the wise-hearted counsel of Zeus.  And do not you, my brother,
 bearer of the golden wand, bid me tell those decrees which all-
 seeing Zeus intends.  As for men, I will harm one and profit
 another, sorely perplexing the tribes of unenviable men. 
 Whosoever shall come guided by the call and flight of birds of
 sure omen, that man shall have advantage through my voice, and I
 will not deceive him.  But whoso shall trust to idly-chattering
 birds and shall seek to invoke my prophetic art contrary to my
 will, and to understand more than the eternal gods, I declare
 that he shall come on an idle journey; yet his gifts I would
 take.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 550-568) `But I will tell you another thing, Son of all-
 glorious Maia and Zeus who holds the aegis, luck-bringing genius
 of the gods.  There are certain holy ones, sisters born -- three
 virgins (23) gifted with wings: their heads are besprinkled with
 white meal, and they dwell under a ridge of Parnassus.  These are
 teachers of divination apart from me, the art which I practised
 while yet a boy following herds, though my father paid no heed to
 it.  From their home they fly now here, now there, feeding on
 honey-comb and bringing all things to pass.  And when they are
 inspired through eating yellow honey, they are willing to speak
 truth; but if they be deprived of the gods' sweet food, then they
 speak falsely, as they swarm in and out together.  These, then, I
 give you; enquire of them strictly and delight your heart: and if
 you should teach any mortal so to do, often will he hear your
 response -- if he have good fortune.  Take these, Son of Maia,
 and tend the wild roving, horned oxen and horses and patient
 mules.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 568a-573) So he spake.  And from heaven father Zeus himself
 gave confirmation to his words, and commanded that glorious
 Hermes should be lord over all birds of omen and grim-eyed lions,
 and boars with gleaming tusks, and over dogs and all flocks that
 the wide earth nourishes, and over all sheep; also that he only
 should be the appointed messenger to Hades, who, though he takes
 no gift, shall give him no mean prize.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 574-578) Thus the lord Apollo showed his kindness for the
 Son of Maia by all manner of friendship: and the Son of Cronos
 gave him grace besides.  He consorts with all mortals and
 immortals: a little he profits, but continually throughout the
 dark night he cozens the tribes of mortal men.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 579-580) And so, farewell, Son of Zeus and Maia; but I will
 remember you and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 V. TO APHRODITE (293 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-6) Muse, tell me the deeds of golden Aphrodite the
 Cyprian, who stirs up sweet passion in the gods and subdues the
 tribes of mortal men and birds that fly in air and all the many
 creatures that the dry land rears, and all the sea: all these
 love the deeds of rich-crowned Cytherea.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 7-32) Yet there are three hearts that she cannot bend nor
 yet ensnare.  First is the daughter of Zeus who holds the aegis,
 bright-eyed Athene; for she has no pleasure in the deeds of
 golden Aphrodite, but delights in wars and in the work of Ares,
 in strifes and battles and in preparing famous crafts.  She first
 taught earthly craftsmen to make chariots of war and cars
 variously wrought with bronze, and she, too, teaches tender
 maidens in the house and puts knowledge of goodly arts in each
 one's mind.  Nor does laughter-loving Aphrodite ever tame in love
 Artemis, the huntress with shafts of gold; for she loves archery
 and the slaying of wild beasts in the mountains, the lyre also
 and dancing and thrilling cries and shady woods and the cities of
 upright men.  Nor yet does the pure maiden Hestia love
 Aphrodite's works.  She was the first-born child of wily Cronos
 and youngest too (24), by will of Zeus who holds the aegis, -- a
 queenly maid whom both Poseidon and Apollo sought to wed.  But
 she was wholly unwilling, nay, stubbornly refused; and touching
 the head of father Zeus who holds the aegis, she, that fair
 goddess, sware a great oath which has in truth been fulfilled,
 that she would be a maiden all her days.  So Zeus the Father gave
 her an high honour instead of marriage, and she has her place in
 the midst of the house and has the richest portion.  In all the
 temples of the gods she has a share of honour, and among all
 mortal men she is chief of the goddesses.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 33-44) Of these three Aphrodite cannot bend or ensnare the
 hearts.  But of all others there is nothing among the blessed
 gods or among mortal men that has escaped Aphrodite.  Even the
 heart of Zeus, who delights in thunder, is led astray by her;
 though he is greatest of all and has the lot of highest majesty,
 she beguiles even his wise heart whensoever she pleases, and
 mates him with mortal women, unknown to Hera, his sister and his
 wife, the grandest far in beauty among the deathless goddesses --
 most glorious is she whom wily Cronos with her mother Rhea did
 beget: and Zeus, whose wisdom is everlasting, made her his chaste
 and careful wife.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 45-52) But upon Aphrodite herself Zeus cast sweet desire to
 be joined in love with a mortal man, to the end that, very soon,
 not even she should be innocent of a mortal's love; lest
 laughter-loving Aphrodite should one day softly smile and say
 mockingly among all the gods that she had joined the gods in love
 with mortal women who bare sons of death to the deathless gods,
 and had mated the goddesses with mortal men.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 53-74) And so he put in her heart sweet desire for Anchises
 who was tending cattle at that time among the steep hills of
 many-fountained Ida, and in shape was like the immortal gods. 
 Therefore, when laughter-loving Aphrodite saw him, she loved him,
 and terribly desire seized her in her heart.  She went to Cyprus,
 to Paphos, where her precinct is and fragrant altar, and passed
 into her sweet-smelling temple.  There she went in and put to the
 glittering doors, and there the Graces bathed her with heavenly
 oil such as blooms upon the bodies of the eternal gods -- oil
 divinely sweet, which she had by her, filled with fragrance.  And
 laughter-loving Aphrodite put on all her rich clothes, and when
 she had decked herself with gold, she left sweet-smelling Cyprus
 and went in haste towards Troy, swiftly travelling high up among
 the clouds.  So she came to many-fountained Ida, the mother of
 wild creatures and went straight to the homestead across the
 mountains.  After her came grey wolves, fawning on her, and grim-
 eyed lions, and bears, and fleet leopards, ravenous for deer: and
 she was glad in heart to see them, and put desire in their
 breasts, so that they all mated, two together, about the shadowy
 coombes.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 75-88) (25) But she herself came to the neat-built shelters,
 and him she found left quite alone in the homestead -- the hero
 Anchises who was comely as the gods.  All the others were
 following the herds over the grassy pastures, and he, left quite
 alone in the homestead, was roaming hither and thither and
 playing thrillingly upon the lyre.  And Aphrodite, the daughter
 of Zeus stood before him, being like a pure maiden in height and
 mien, that he should not be frightened when he took heed of her
 with his eyes.  Now when Anchises saw her, he marked her well and
 wondered at her mien and height and shining garments.  For she
 was clad in a robe out-shining the brightness of fire, a splendid
 robe of gold, enriched with all manner of needlework, which
 shimmered like the moon over her tender breasts, a marvel to see.
 </p><p>
 Also she wore twisted brooches and shining earrings in the form
 of flowers; and round her soft throat were lovely necklaces.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 91-105) And Anchises was seized with love, and said to her:
 `Hail, lady, whoever of the blessed ones you are that are come to
 this house, whether Artemis, or Leto, or golden Aphrodite, or
 high-born Themis, or bright-eyed Athene.  Or, maybe, you are one
 of the Graces come hither, who bear the gods company and are
 called immortal, or else one of those who inhabit this lovely
 mountain and the springs of rivers and grassy meads.  I will make
 you an altar upon a high peak in a far seen place, and will
 sacrifice rich offerings to you at all seasons.  And do you feel
 kindly towards me and grant that I may become a man very eminent
 among the Trojans, and give me strong offspring for the time to
 come.  As for my own self, let me live long and happily, seeing
 the light of the sun, and come to the threshold of old age, a man
 prosperous among the people.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 106-142) Thereupon Aphrodite the daughter of Zeus answered
 him: `Anchises, most glorious of all men born on earth, know that
 I am no goddess: why do you liken me to the deathless ones?  Nay,
 I am but a mortal, and a woman was the mother that bare me. 
 Otreus of famous name is my father, if so be you have heard of
 him, and he reigns over all Phrygia rich in fortresses.  But I
 know your speech well beside my own, for a Trojan nurse brought
 me up at home: she took me from my dear mother and reared me
 thenceforth when I was a little child.  So comes it, then, that I
 well know you tongue also.  And now the Slayer of Argus with the
 golden wand has caught me up from the dance of huntress Artemis,
 her with the golden arrows.  For there were many of us, nymphs
 and marriageable (26) maidens, playing together; and an
 innumerable company encircled us: from these the Slayer of Argus
 with the golden wand rapt me away.  He carried me over many
 fields of mortal men and over much land untilled and unpossessed,
 where savage wild-beasts roam through shady coombes, until I
 thought never again to touch the life-giving earth with my feet. 
 And he said that I should be called the wedded wife of Anchises,
 and should bear you goodly children.  But when he had told and
 advised me, he, the strong Slayer of Argos, went back to the
 families of the deathless gods, while I am now come to you: for
 unbending necessity is upon me.  But I beseech you by Zeus and by
 your noble parents -- for no base folk could get such a son as
 you -- take me now, stainless and unproved in love, and show me
 to your father and careful mother and to your brothers sprung
 from the same stock.  I shall be no ill-liking daughter for them,
 but a likely.  Moreover, send a messenger quickly to the swift-
 horsed Phrygians, to tell my father and my sorrowing mother; and
 they will send you gold in plenty and woven stuffs, many splendid
 gifts; take these as bride-piece.  So do, and then prepare the
 sweet marriage that is honourable in the eyes of men and
 deathless gods.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 143-144) When she had so spoken, the goddess put sweet
 desire in his heart.  And Anchises was seized with love, so that
 he opened his mouth and said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 145-154) `If you are a mortal and a woman was the mother who
 bare you, and Otreus of famous name is your father as you say,
 and if you are come here by the will of Hermes the immortal
 Guide, and are to be called my wife always, then neither god nor
 mortal man shall here restrain me till I have lain with you in
 love right now; no, not even if far-shooting Apollo himself
 should launch grievous shafts from his silver bow.  Willingly
 would I go down into the house of Hades, O lady, beautiful as the
 goddesses, once I had gone up to your bed.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 155-167) So speaking, he caught her by the hand.  And
 laughter-loving Aphrodite, with face turned away and lovely eyes
 downcast, crept to the well-spread couch which was already laid
 with soft coverings for the hero; and upon it lay skins of bears
 and deep-roaring lions which he himself had slain in the high
 mountains.  And when they had gone up upon the well-fitted bed,
 first Anchises took off her bright jewelry of pins and twisted
 brooches and earrings and necklaces, and loosed her girdle and
 stripped off her bright garments and laid them down upon a
 silver-studded seat.  Then by the will of the gods and destiny he
 lay with her, a mortal man with an immortal goddess, not clearly
 knowing what he did.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 168-176) But at the time when the herdsmen driver their oxen
 and hardy sheep back to the fold from the flowery pastures, even
 then Aphrodite poured soft sleep upon Anchises, but herself put
 on her rich raiment.  And when the bright goddess had fully
 clothed herself, she stood by the couch, and her head reached to
 the well-hewn roof-tree; from her cheeks shone unearthly beauty
 such as belongs to rich-crowned Cytherea.  Then she aroused him
 from sleep and opened her mouth and said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 177-179) `Up, son of Dardanus! -- why sleep you so heavily?
 -- and consider whether I look as I did when first you saw me
 with your eyes.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 180-184) So she spake.  And he awoke in a moment and obeyed
 her.  But when he saw the neck and lovely eyes of Aphrodite, he
 was afraid and turned his eyes aside another way, hiding his
 comely face with his cloak.  Then he uttered winged words and
 entreated her:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 185-190) `So soon as ever I saw you with my eyes, goddess, I
 knew that you were divine; but you did not tell me truly.  Yet by
 Zeus who holds the aegis I beseech you, leave me not to lead a
 palsied life among men, but have pity on me; for he who lies with
 a deathless goddess is no hale man afterwards.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 191-201) Then Aphrodite the daughter of Zeus answered him:
 `Anchises, most glorious of mortal men, take courage and be not
 too fearful in your heart.  You need fear no harm from me nor
 from the other blessed ones, for you are dear to the gods: and
 you shall have a dear son who shall reign among the Trojans, and
 children's children after him, springing up continually.  His
 name shall be Aeneas (27), because I felt awful grief in that I
 laid me in the bed of mortal man: yet are those of your race
 always the most like to gods of all mortal men in beauty and in
 stature (28).
 </p><p>
 (ll. 202-217) `Verily wise Zeus carried off golden-haired
 Ganymedes because of his beauty, to be amongst the Deathless Ones
 and pour drink for the gods in the house of Zeus -- a wonder to
 see -- honoured by all the immortals as he draws the red nectar
 from the golden bowl.  But grief that could not be soothed filled
 the heart of Tros; for he knew not whither the heaven-sent
 whirlwind had caught up his dear son, so that he mourned him
 always, unceasingly, until Zeus pitied him and gave him high-
 stepping horses such as carry the immortals as recompense for his
 son.  These he gave him as a gift.  And at the command of Zeus,
 the Guide, the slayer of Argus, told him all, and how his son
 would be deathless and unageing, even as the gods.  So when Tros
 heard these tidings from Zeus, he no longer kept mourning but
 rejoiced in his heart and rode joyfully with his storm-footed
 horses.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 218-238) `So also golden-throned Eos rapt away Tithonus who
 was of your race and like the deathless gods.  And she went to
 ask the dark-clouded Son of Cronos that he should be deathless
 and live eternally; and Zeus bowed his head to her prayer and
 fulfilled her desire.  Too simply was queenly Eos: she thought
 not in her heart to ask youth for him and to strip him of the
 slough of deadly age.  So while he enjoyed the sweet flower of
 life he lived rapturously with golden-throned Eos, the early-
 born, by the streams of Ocean, at the ends of the earth; but when
 the first grey hairs began to ripple from his comely head and
 noble chin, queenly Eos kept away from his bed, though she
 cherished him in her house and nourished him with food and
 ambrosia and gave him rich clothing.  But when loathsome old age
 pressed full upon him, and he could not move nor lift his limbs,
 this seemed to her in her heart the best counsel: she laid him in
 a room and put to the shining doors.  There he babbles endlessly,
 and no more has strength at all, such as once he had in his
 supple limbs.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 239-246) `I would not have you be deathless among the
 deathless gods and live continually after such sort.  Yet if you
 could live on such as now you are in look and in form, and be
 called my husband, sorrow would not then enfold my careful heart.
 </p><p>
 But, as it is, harsh (29) old age will soon enshroud you --
 ruthless age which stands someday at the side of every man,
 deadly, wearying, dreaded even by the gods.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 247-290) `And now because of you I shall have great shame
 among the deathless gods henceforth, continually.  For until now
 they feared my jibes and the wiles by which, or soon or late, I
 mated all the immortals with mortal women, making them all
 subject to my will.  But now my mouth shall no more have this
 power among the gods; for very great has been my madness, my
 miserable and dreadful madness, and I went astray out of my mind
 who have gotten a child beneath my girdle, mating with a mortal
 man.  As for the child, as soon as he sees the light of the sun,
 the deep-breasted mountain Nymphs who inhabit this great and holy
 mountain shall bring him up.  They rank neither with mortals nor
 with immortals: long indeed do they live, eating heavenly food
 and treading the lovely dance among the immortals, and with them
 the Sileni and the sharp-eyed Slayer of Argus mate in the depths
 of pleasant caves; but at their birth pines or high-topped oaks
 spring up with them upon the fruitful earth, beautiful,
 flourishing trees, towering high upon the lofty mountains (and
 men call them holy places of the immortals, and never mortal lops
 them with the axe); but when the fate of death is near at hand,
 first those lovely trees wither where they stand, and the bark
 shrivels away about them, and the twigs fall down, and at last
 the life of the Nymph and of the tree leave the light of the sun
 together.  These Nymphs shall keep my son with them and rear him,
 and as soon as he is come to lovely boyhood, the goddesses will
 bring him here to you and show you your child.  But, that I may
 tell you all that I have in mind, I will come here again towards
 the fifth year and bring you my son.  So soon as ever you have
 seen him -- a scion to delight the eyes -- you will rejoice in
 beholding him; for he shall be most godlike: then bring him at
 once to windy Ilion.  And if any mortal man ask you who got your
 dear son beneath her girdle, remember to tell him as I bid you:
 say he is the offspring of one of the flower-like Nymphs who
 inhabit this forest-clad hill.  But if you tell all and foolishly
 boast that you lay with rich-crowned Aphrodite, Zeus will smite
 you in his anger with a smoking thunderbolt.  Now I have told you
 all.  Take heed: refrain and name me not, but have regard to the
 anger of the gods.'
 </p><p>
 (l. 291) When the goddess had so spoken, she soared up to windy
 heaven.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 292-293) Hail, goddess, queen of well-builded Cyprus!  With
 you have I begun; now I will turn me to another hymn.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VI. TO APHRODITE (21 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-18) I will sing of stately Aphrodite, gold-crowned and
 beautiful, whose dominion is the walled cities of all sea-set
 Cyprus.  There the moist breath of the western wind wafted her
 over the waves of the loud-moaning sea in soft foam, and there
 the gold-filleted Hours welcomed her joyously.  They clothed her
 with heavenly garments: on her head they put a fine, well-wrought
 crown of gold, and in her pierced ears they hung ornaments of
 orichalc and precious gold, and adorned her with golden necklaces
 over her soft neck and snow-white breasts, jewels which the gold-
 filleted Hours wear themselves whenever they go to their father's
 house to join the lovely dances of the gods.  And when they had
 fully decked her, they brought her to the gods, who welcomed her
 when they saw her, giving her their hands.  Each one of them
 prayed that he might lead her home to be his wedded wife, so
 greatly were they amazed at the beauty of violet-crowned
 Cytherea.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 19-21) Hail, sweetly-winning, coy-eyed goddess!  Grant that
 I may gain the victory in this contest, and order you my song. 
 And now I will remember you and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 VII. TO DIONYSUS (59 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-16) I will tell of Dionysus, the son of glorious Semele,
 how he appeared on a jutting headland by the shore of the
 fruitless sea, seeming like a stripling in the first flush of
 manhood: his rich, dark hair was waving about him, and on his
 strong shoulders he wore a purple robe.  Presently there came
 swiftly over the sparkling sea Tyrsenian (30) pirates on a well-
 decked ship -- a miserable doom led them on.  When they saw him
 they made signs to one another and sprang out quickly, and
 seizing him straightway, put him on board their ship exultingly;
 for they thought him the son of heaven-nurtured kings.  They
 sought to bind him with rude bonds, but the bonds would not hold
 him, and the withes fell far away from his hands and feet: and he
 sat with a smile in his dark eyes.  Then the helmsman understood
 all and cried out at once to his fellows and said:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 17-24) `Madmen!  What god is this whom you have taken and
 bind, strong that he is?  Not even the well-built ship can carry
 him.  Surely this is either Zeus or Apollo who has the silver
 bow, or Poseidon, for he looks not like mortal men but like the
 gods who dwell on Olympus.  Come, then, let us set him free upon
 the dark shore at once: do not lay hands on him, lest he grow
 angry and stir up dangerous winds and heavy squalls.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 25-31) So said he: but the master chid him with taunting
 words: `Madman, mark the wind and help hoist sail on the ship:
 catch all the sheets.  As for this fellow we men will see to him:
 I reckon he is bound for Egypt or for Cyprus or to the
 Hyperboreans or further still.  But in the end he will speak out
 and tell us his friends and all his wealth and his brothers, now
 that providence has thrown him in our way.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 32-54) When he had said this, he had mast and sail hoisted
 on the ship, and the wind filled the sail and the crew hauled
 taut the sheets on either side.  But soon strange things were
 seen among them.  First of all sweet, fragrant wine ran streaming
 throughout all the black ship and a heavenly smell arose, so that
 all the seamen were seized with amazement when they saw it.  And
 all at once a vine spread out both ways along the top of the sail
 with many clusters hanging down from it, and a dark ivy-plant
 twined about the mast, blossoming with flowers, and with rich
 berries growing on it; and all the thole-pins were covered with
 garlands.  When the pirates saw all this, then at last they bade
 the helmsman to put the ship to land.  But the god changed into a
 dreadful lion there on the ship, in the bows, and roared loudly:
 amidships also he showed his wonders and created a shaggy bear
 which stood up ravening, while on the forepeak was the lion
 glaring fiercely with scowling brows.  And so the sailors fled
 into the stern and crowded bemused about the right-minded
 helmsman, until suddenly the lion sprang upon the master and
 seized him; and when the sailors saw it they leapt out overboard
 one and all into the bright sea, escaping from a miserable fate,
 and were changed into dolphins.  But on the helmsman Dionysus had
 mercy and held him back and made him altogether happy, saying to
 him:
 </p><p>
 (ll. 55-57) `Take courage, good...; you have found favour with my
 heart.  I am loud-crying Dionysus whom Cadmus' daughter Semele
 bare of union with Zeus.'
 </p><p>
 (ll. 58-59) Hail, child of fair-faced Semele!  He who forgets you
 can in no wise order sweet song.
 </p><p>
 VIII. TO ARES (17 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-17) Ares, exceeding in strength, chariot-rider, golden-
 helmed, doughty in heart, shield-bearer, Saviour of cities,
 harnessed in bronze, strong of arm, unwearying, mighty with the
 spear, O defence of Olympus, father of warlike Victory, ally of
 Themis, stern governor of the rebellious, leader of righteous
 men, sceptred King of manliness, who whirl your fiery sphere
 among the planets in their sevenfold courses through the aether
 wherein your blazing steeds ever bear you above the third
 firmament of heaven; hear me, helper of men, giver of dauntless
 youth!  Shed down a kindly ray from above upon my life, and
 strength of war, that I may be able to drive away bitter
 cowardice from my head and crush down the deceitful impulses of
 my soul.  Restrain also the keen fury of my heart which provokes
 me to tread the ways of blood-curdling strife.  Rather, O blessed
 one, give you me boldness to abide within the harmless laws of
 peace, avoiding strife and hatred and the violent fiends of
 death.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 IX. TO ARTEMIS (9 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-6) Muse, sing of Artemis, sister of the Far-shooter, the
 virgin who delights in arrows, who was fostered with Apollo.  She
 waters her horses from Meles deep in reeds, and swiftly drives
 her all-golden chariot through Smyrna to vine-clad Claros where
 Apollo, god of the silver bow, sits waiting for the far-shooting
 goddess who delights in arrows.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 7-9) And so hail to you, Artemis, in my song and to all
 goddesses as well.  Of you first I sing and with you I begin; now
 that I have begun with you, I will turn to another song.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 X. TO APHRODITE (6 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-3) Of Cytherea, born in Cyprus, I will sing.  She gives
 kindly gifts to men: smiles are ever on her lovely face, and
 lovely is the brightness that plays over it.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 4-6) Hail, goddess, queen of well-built Salamis and sea-girt
 Cyprus; grant me a cheerful song.  And now I will remember you
 and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XI. TO ATHENA (5 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-4) Of Pallas Athene, guardian of the city, I begin to
 sing.  Dread is she, and with Ares she loves deeds of war, the
 sack of cities and the shouting and the battle.  It is she who
 saves the people as they go out to war and come back.
 </p><p>
 (l. 5) Hail, goddess, and give us good fortune with happiness!
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XII. TO HERA (5 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-5) I sing of golden-throned Hera whom Rhea bare.  Queen of
 the immortals is she, surpassing all in beauty: she is the sister
 and the wife of loud-thundering Zeus, -- the glorious one whom
 all the blessed throughout high Olympus reverence and honour even
 as Zeus who delights in thunder.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIII. TO DEMETER (3 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-2) I begin to sing of rich-haired Demeter, awful goddess,
 of her and of her daughter lovely Persephone.
 </p><p>
 (l. 3) Hail, goddess!  Keep this city safe, and govern my song.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIV. TO THE MOTHER OF THE GODS (6 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-5) I prithee, clear-voiced Muse, daughter of mighty Zeus,
 sing of the mother of all gods and men.  She is well-pleased with
 the sound of rattles and of timbrels, with the voice of flutes
 and the outcry of wolves and bright-eyed lions, with echoing
 hills and wooded coombes.
 </p><p>
 (l. 6) And so hail to you in my song and to all goddesses as
 well!
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XV. TO HERACLES THE LION-HEARTED (9 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-8) I will sing of Heracles, the son of Zeus and much the
 mightiest of men on earth.  Alcmena bare him in Thebes, the city
 of lovely dances, when the dark-clouded Son of Cronos had lain
 with her.  Once he used to wander over unmeasured tracts of land
 and sea at the bidding of King Eurystheus, and himself did many
 deeds of violence and endured many; but now he lives happily in
 the glorious home of snowy Olympus, and has neat-ankled Hebe for
 his wife.
 </p><p>
 (l. 9) Hail, lord, son of Zeus!  Give me success and prosperity.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVI. TO ASCLEPIUS (5 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-4) I begin to sing of Asclepius, son of Apollo and healer
 of sicknesses.  In the Dotian plain fair Coronis, daughter of
 King Phlegyas, bare him, a great joy to men, a soother of cruel
 pangs.
 </p><p>
 (l. 5) And so hail to you, lord: in my song I make my prayer to
 thee!
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVII. TO THE DIOSCURI (5 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-4) Sing, clear-voiced Muse, of Castor and Polydeuces, the
 Tyndaridae, who sprang from Olympian Zeus.  Beneath the heights
 fo Taygetus stately Leda bare them, when the dark-clouded Son of
 Cronos had privily bent her to his will.
 </p><p>
 (l. 5) Hail, children of Tyndareus, riders upon swift horses!
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XVIII. TO HERMES (12 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-9) I sing of Cyllenian Hermes, the Slayer of Argus, lord
 of Cyllene and Arcadia rich in flocks, luck-bringing messenger of
 the deathless gods.  He was born of Maia, the daughter of Atlas,
 when she had made with Zeus, -- a shy goddess she.  Ever she
 avoided the throng of the blessed gods and lived in a shadowy
 cave, and there the Son of Cronos used to lie with the rich-
 tressed nymph at dead of night, while white-armed Hera lay bound
 in sweet sleep: and neither deathless god nor mortal man knew it.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 10-11) And so hail to you, Son of Zeus and Maia; with you I
 have begun: now I will turn to another song!
 </p><p>
 (l. 12) Hail, Hermes, giver of grace, guide, and giver of good
 things! (31)
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XIX. TO PAN (49 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-26) Muse, tell me about Pan, the dear son of Hermes, with
 his goat's feet and two horns -- a lover of merry noise.  Through
 wooded glades he wanders with dancing nymphs who foot it on some
 sheer cliff's edge, calling upon Pan, the shepherd-god, long-
 haired, unkempt.  He has every snowy crest and the mountain peaks
 and rocky crests for his domain; hither and thither he goes
 through the close thickets, now lured by soft streams, and now he
 presses on amongst towering crags and climbs up to the highest
 peak that overlooks the flocks.  Often he courses through the
 glistening high mountains, and often on the shouldered hills he
 speeds along slaying wild beasts, this keen-eyed god.  Only at
 evening, as he returns from the chase, he sounds his note,
 playing sweet and low on his pipes of reed: not even she could
 excel him in melody -- that bird who in flower-laden spring
 pouring forth her lament utters honey-voiced song amid the
 leaves.  At that hour the clear-voiced nymphs are with him and
 move with nimble feet, singing by some spring of dark water,
 while Echo wails about the mountain-top, and the god on this side
 or on that of the choirs, or at times sidling into the midst,
 plies it nimbly with his feet.  On his back he wears a spotted
 lynx-pelt, and he delights in high-pitched songs in a soft meadow
 where crocuses and sweet-smelling hyacinths bloom at random in
 the grass.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 27-47) They sing of the blessed gods and high Olympus and
 choose to tell of such an one as luck-bringing Hermes above the
 rest, how he is the swift messenger of all the gods, and how he
 came to Arcadia, the land of many springs and mother of flocks,
 there where his sacred place is as god fo Cyllene.  For there,
 though a god, he used to tend curly-fleeced sheep in the service
 of a mortal man, because there fell on him and waxed strong
 melting desire to wed the rich-tressed daughter of Dryops, and
 there be brought about the merry marriage.  And in the house she
 bare Hermes a dear son who from his birth was marvellous to look
 upon, with goat's feet and two horns -- a noisy, merry-laughing
 child.  But when the nurse saw his uncouth face and full beard,
 she was afraid and sprang up and fled and left the child.  Then
 luck-bringing Hermes received him and took him in his arms: very
 glad in his heart was the god.  And he went quickly to the abodes
 of the deathless gods, carrying the son wrapped in warm skins of
 mountain hares, and set him down beside Zeus and showed him to
 the rest of the gods.  Then all the immortals were glad in heart
 and Bacchie Dionysus in especial; and they called the boy Pan
 (32) because he delighted all their hearts.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 48-49) And so hail to you, lord!  I seek your favour with a
 song.  And now I will remember you and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XX. TO HEPHAESTUS (8 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-7) Sing, clear-voiced Muses, of Hephaestus famed for
 inventions.  With bright-eyed Athene he taught men glorious gifts
 throughout the world, -- men who before used to dwell in caves in
 the mountains like wild beasts.  But now that they have learned
 crafts through Hephaestus the famed worker, easily they live a
 peaceful life in their own houses the whole year round.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 (l. 8) Be gracious, Hephaestus, and grant me success and
 prosperity!
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXI. TO APOLLO (5 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-4) Phoebus, of you even the swan sings with clear voice to
 the beating of his wings, as he alights upon the bank by the
 eddying river Peneus; and of you the sweet-tongued minstrel,
 holding his high-pitched lyre, always sings both first and last.
 </p><p>
 (l. 5) And so hail to you, lord!  I seek your favour with my
 song.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXII. TO POSEIDON (7 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-5) I begin to sing about Poseidon, the great god, mover of
 the earth and fruitless sea, god of the deep who is also lord of
 Helicon and wide Aegae.  A two-fold office the gods allotted you,
 O Shaker of the Earth, to be a tamer of horses and a saviour of
 ships!
 </p><p>
 (ll. 6-7) Hail, Poseidon, Holder of the Earth, dark-haired lord! 
 O blessed one, be kindly in heart and help those who voyage in
 ships!
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIII. TO THE SON OF CRONOS, MOST HIGH (4 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-3) I will sing of Zeus, chiefest among the gods and
 greatest, all-seeing, the lord of all, the fulfiller who whispers
 words of wisdom to Themis as she sits leaning towards him.
 </p><p>
 (l. 4) Be gracious, all-seeing Son of Cronos, most excellent and
 great!
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIV. TO HESTIA (5 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-5) Hestia, you who tend the holy house of the lord Apollo,
 the Far-shooter at goodly Pytho, with soft oil dripping ever from
 your locks, come now into this house, come, having one mind with
 Zeus the all-wise -- draw near, and withal bestow grace upon my
 song.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXV. TO THE MUSES AND APOLLO (7 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-5) I will begin with the Muses and Apollo and Zeus.  For
 it is through the Muses and Apollo that there are singers upon
 the earth and players upon the lyre; but kings are from Zeus. 
 Happy is he whom the Muses love: sweet flows speech from his
 lips.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 6-7) Hail, children of Zeus!  Give honour to my song!  And
 now I will remember you and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVI. TO DIONYSUS (13 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-9) I begin to sing of ivy-crowned Dionysus, the loud-
 crying god, splendid son of Zeus and glorious Semele.  The rich-
 haired Nymphs received him in their bosoms from the lord his
 father and fostered and nurtured him carefully in the dells of
 Nysa, where by the will of his father he grew up in a sweet-
 smelling cave, being reckoned among the immortals.  But when the
 goddesses had brought him up, a god oft hymned, then began he to
 wander continually through the woody coombes, thickly wreathed
 with ivy and laurel.  And the Nymphs followed in his train with
 him for their leader; and the boundless forest was filled with
 their outcry.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 10-13) And so hail to you, Dionysus, god of abundant
 clusters!  Grant that we may come again rejoicing to this season,
 and from that season onwards for many a year.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVII. TO ARTEMIS (22 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-20) I sing of Artemis, whose shafts are of gold, who
 cheers on the hounds, the pure maiden, shooter of stags, who
 delights in archery, own sister to Apollo with the golden sword. 
 Over the shadowy hills and windy peaks she draws her golden bow,
 rejoicing in the chase, and sends out grievous shafts.  The tops
 of the high mountains tremble and the tangled wood echoes
 awesomely with the outcry of beasts: earthquakes and the sea also
 where fishes shoal.  But the goddess with a bold heart turns
 every way destroying the race of wild beasts: and when she is
 satisfied and has cheered her heart, this huntress who delights
 in arrows slackens her supple bow and goes to the great house of
 her dear brother Phoebus Apollo, to the rich land of Delphi,
 there to order the lovely dance of the Muses and Graces.  There
 she hangs up her curved bow and her arrows, and heads and leads
 the dances, gracefully arrayed, while all they utter their
 heavenly voice, singing how neat-ankled Leto bare children
 supreme among the immortals both in thought and in deed.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 21-22) Hail to you, children of Zeus and rich-haired Leto! 
 And now I will remember you and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXVIII. TO ATHENA (18 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-16) I begin to sing of Pallas Athene, the glorious
 goddess, bright-eyed, inventive, unbending of heart, pure virgin,
 saviour of cities, courageous, Tritogeneia.  From his awful head
 wise Zeus himself bare her arrayed in warlike arms of flashing
 gold, and awe seized all the gods as they gazed.  But Athena
 sprang quickly from the immortal head and stood before Zeus who
 holds the aegis, shaking a sharp spear: great Olympus began to
 reel horribly at the might of the bright-eyed goddess, and earth
 round about cried fearfully, and the sea was moved and tossed
 with dark waves, while foam burst forth suddenly: the bright Son
 of Hyperion stopped his swift-footed horses a long while, until
 the maiden Pallas Athene had stripped the heavenly armour from
 her immortal shoulders.  And wise Zeus was glad.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 17-18) And so hail to you, daughter of Zeus who holds the
 aegis!  Now I will remember you and another song as well.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXIX. TO HESTIA (13 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-6) Hestia, in the high dwellings of all, both deathless
 gods and men who walk on earth, you have gained an everlasting
 abode and highest honour: glorious is your portion and your
 right.  For without you mortals hold no banquet, -- where one
 does not duly pour sweet wine in offering to Hestia both first
 and last.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 7-10) (33) And you, slayer of Argus, Son of Zeus and Maia,
 messenger of the blessed gods, bearer of the golden rod, giver of
 good, be favourable and help us, you and Hestia, the worshipful
 and dear.  Come and dwell in this glorious house in friendship
 together; for you two, well knowing the noble actions of men, aid
 on their wisdom and their strength.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 12-13) Hail, Daughter of Cronos, and you also, Hermes,
 bearer of the golden rod!  Now I will remember you and another
 song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXX. TO EARTH THE MOTHER OF ALL (19 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-16) I will sing of well-founded Earth, mother of all,
 eldest of all beings.  She feeds all creatures that are in the
 world, all that go upon the goodly land, and all that are in the
 paths of the seas, and all that fly: all these are fed of her
 store.  Through you, O queen, men are blessed in their children
 and blessed in their harvests, and to you it belongs to give
 means of life to mortal men and to take it away.  Happy is the
 man whom you delight to honour!  He has all things abundantly:
 his fruitful land is laden with corn, his pastures are covered
 with cattle, and his house is filled with good things.  Such men
 rule orderly in their cities of fair women: great riches and
 wealth follow them: their sons exult with ever-fresh delight, and
 their daughters in flower-laden bands play and skip merrily over
 the soft flowers of the field.  Thus is it with those whom you
 honour O holy goddess, bountiful spirit.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 17-19) Hail, Mother of the gods, wife of starry Heaven;
 freely bestow upon me for this my song substance that cheers the
 heart!  And now I will remember you and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXI. TO HELIOS (20 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-16) (34) And now, O Muse Calliope, daughter of Zeus, begin
 to sing of glowing Helios whom mild-eyed Euryphaessa, the far-
 shining one, bare to the Son of Earth and starry Heaven.  For
 Hyperion wedded glorious Euryphaessa, his own sister, who bare
 him lovely children, rosy-armed Eos and rich-tressed Selene and
 tireless Helios who is like the deathless gods.  As he rides in
 his chariot, he shines upon men and deathless gods, and
 piercingly he gazes with his eyes from his golden helmet.  Bright
 rays beam dazzlingly from him, and his bright locks streaming
 form the temples of his head gracefully enclose his far-seen
 face: a rich, fine-spun garment glows upon his body and flutters
 in the wind: and stallions carry him.  Then, when he has stayed
 his golden-yoked chariot and horses, he rests there upon the
 highest point of heaven, until he marvellously drives them down
 again through heaven to Ocean.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 17-19) Hail to you, lord!  Freely bestow on me substance
 that cheers the heart.  And now that I have begun with you, I
 will celebrate the race of mortal men half-divine whose deeds the
 Muses have showed to mankind.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXII. TO SELENE (20 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-13) And next, sweet voiced Muses, daughters of Zeus, well-
 skilled in song, tell of the long-winged (35) Moon.  From her
 immortal head a radiance is shown from heaven and embraces earth;
 and great is the beauty that ariseth from her shining light.  The
 air, unlit before, glows with the light of her golden crown, and
 her rays beam clear, whensoever bright Selene having bathed her
 lovely body in the waters of Ocean, and donned her far-gleaming,
 shining team, drives on her long-maned horses at full speed, at
 eventime in the mid-month: then her great orbit is full and then
 her beams shine brightest as she increases.  So she is a sure
 token and a sign to mortal men.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 14-16) Once the Son of Cronos was joined with her in love;
 and she conceived and bare a daughter Pandia, exceeding lovely
 amongst the deathless gods.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 17-20) Hail, white-armed goddess, bright Selene, mild,
 bright-tressed queen!  And now I will leave you and sing the
 glories of men half-divine, whose deeds minstrels, the servants
 of the Muses, celebrate with lovely lips.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 XXXIII. TO THE DIOSCURI (19 lines)
 </p><p>
 (ll. 1-17) Bright-eyed Muses, tell of the Tyndaridae, the Sons of
 Zeus, glorious children of neat-ankled Leda, Castor the tamer of
 horses, and blameless Polydeuces.  When Leda had lain with the
 dark-clouded Son of Cronos, she bare them beneath the peak of the
 great hill Taygetus, -- children who are delivers of men on earth
 and of swift-going ships when stormy gales rage over the ruthless
 sea.  Then the shipmen call upon the sons of great Zeus with vows
 of white lambs, going to the forepart of the prow; but the strong
 wind and the waves of the sea lay the ship under water, until
 suddenly these two are seen darting through the air on tawny
 wings.  Forthwith they allay the blasts of the cruel winds and
 still the waves upon the surface of the white sea: fair signs are
 they and deliverance from toil.  And when the shipmen see them
 they are glad and have rest from their pain and labour.
 </p><p>
 (ll. 18-19) Hail, Tyndaridae, riders upon swift horses!  Now I
 will remember you and another song also.
 </p><p>
 </p><p>
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ENDNOTES:</h3>
 <p>
 (1)  ll. 1-9 are preserved by Diodorus Siculus iii. 66. 3; ll.
      10-21 are extant only in M.<br>
 (2)  Dionysus, after his untimely birth from Semele, was sewn
      into the thigh of Zeus.<br>
 (3)  sc. Semele.  Zeus is here speaking.<br>
 (4)  The reference is apparently to something in the body of the
      hymn, now lost.<br>
 (5)  The Greeks feared to name Pluto directly and mentioned him
      by one of many descriptive titles, such as `Host of Many':
      compare the Christian use of O DIABOLOS or our `Evil One'.<br>
 (6)  Demeter chooses the lowlier seat, supposedly as being more
      suitable to her assumed condition, but really because in her
      sorrow she refuses all comforts.<br>
 (7)  An act of communion -- the drinking of the potion here
      described -- was one of the most important pieces of ritual
      in the Eleusinian mysteries, as commemorating the sorrows of
      the goddess.<br>
 (8)  Undercutter and Woodcutter are probably popular names (after
      the style of Hesiod's `Boneless One') for the worm thought
      to be the cause of teething and toothache.<br>
 (9)  The list of names is taken -- with five additions -- from
      Hesiod, "Theogony" 349 ff.: for their general significance
      see note on that passage.<br>
 (10) Inscriptions show that there was a temple of Apollo
      Delphinius (cp. ii. 495-6) at Cnossus and a Cretan month
      bearing the same name.<br>
 (11) sc. that the dolphin was really Apollo.<br>
 (12) The epithets are transferred from the god to his altar
      `Overlooking' is especially an epithet of Zeus, as in
      Apollonius Rhodius ii. 1124.<br>
 (13) Pliny notices the efficacy of the flesh of a tortoise
      against withcraft.  In "Geoponica" i. 14. 8 the living
      tortoise is prescribed as a charm to preserve vineyards from
      hail.<br>
 (14) Hermes makes the cattle walk backwards way, so that they
      seem to be going towards the meadow instead of leaving it
      (cp. l. 345); he himself walks in the normal manner, relying
      on his sandals as a disguise.<br>
 (15) Such seems to be the meaning indicated by the context,
      though the verb is taken by Allen and Sikes to mean, `to be
      like oneself', and so `to be original'.<br>
 (16) Kuhn points out that there is a lacuna here.  In l. 109 the
      borer is described, but the friction of this upon the
      fireblock (to which the phrase `held firmly' clearly
      belongs) must also have been mentioned.<br>
 (17) The cows being on their sides on the ground, Hermes bends
      their heads back towards their flanks and so can reach their
      backbones.<br>
 (18) O. Muller thinks the `hides' were a stalactite formation in
      the `Cave of Nestor' near Messenian Pylos, -- though the
      cave of Hermes is near the Alpheus (l. 139).  Others suggest
      that actual skins were shown as relics before some cave near
      Triphylian Pylos.<br>
 (19) Gemoll explains that Hermes, having offered all the meat as
      sacrifice to the Twelve Gods, remembers that he himself as
      one of them must be content with the savour instead of the
      substance of the sacrifice.  Can it be that by eating he
      would have forfeited the position he claimed as one of the
      Twelve Gods?<br>
 (20) Lit. `thorn-plucker'.<br>
 (21) Hermes is ambitious (l. 175), but if he is cast into Hades
      he will have to be content with the leadership of mere
      babies like himself, since those in Hades retain the state
      of growth -- whether childhood or manhood -- in which they
      are at the moment of leaving the upper world.<br>
 (22) Literally, `you have made him sit on the floor', i.e. `you
      have stolen everything down to his last chair.'<br>
 (23) The Thriae, who practised divination by means of pebbles
      (also called THRIAE).  In this hymn they are represented as
      aged maidens (ll. 553-4), but are closely associated with
      bees (ll. 559-563) and possibly are here conceived as having
      human heads and breasts with the bodies and wings of bees. 
      See the edition of Allen and Sikes, Appendix III.<br>
 (24) Cronos swallowed each of his children the moment that they
      were born, but ultimately was forced to disgorge them. 
      Hestia, being the first to be swallowed, was the last to be
      disgorged, and so was at once the first and latest born of
      the children of Cronos.  Cp. Hesiod "Theogony", ll. 495-7.<br>
 (25) Mr. Evelyn-White prefers a different order for lines #87-90
      than that preserved in the MSS.  This translation is based
      upon the following sequence: ll. 89,90,87,88. -- DBK.<br>
 (26) `Cattle-earning', because an accepted suitor paid for his
      bride in cattle.<br>
 (27) The name Aeneas is here connected with the epithet AIEOS
      (awful): similarly the name Odysseus is derived (in
      "Odyssey" i.62) from ODYSSMAI (I grieve).<br>
 (28) Aphrodite extenuates her disgrace by claiming that the race
      of Anchises is almost divine, as is shown in the persons of
      Ganymedes and Tithonus.<br>
 (29) So Christ connecting the word with OMOS.  L. and S. give =
      OMOIOS, `common to all'.<br>
 (30) Probably not Etruscans, but the non-Hellenic peoples of
      Thrace and (according to Thucydides) of Lemnos and Athens. 
      Cp. Herodotus i. 57; Thucydides iv. 109.<br>
 (31) This line appears to be an alternative to ll. 10-11.<br>
 (32) The name Pan is here derived from PANTES, `all'.  Cp.
      Hesiod, "Works and Days" ll. 80-82, "Hymn to Aphrodite" (v)
      l. 198. for the significance of personal names.<br>
 (33) Mr. Evelyn-White prefers to switch l. 10 and 11, reading 11
      first then 10. -- DBK.<br>
 (34) An extra line is inserted in some MSS. after l. 15. -- DBK.<br>
 (35) The epithet is a usual one for birds, cp. Hesiod, "Works and
      Days", l. 210; as applied to Selene it may merely indicate
      her passage, like a bird, through the air, or mean `far
      flying'.<br>
