 <h2>SALLUSTIUS<br>
 'ON THE GODS AND THE WORLD' <a name="an_fr_200_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_200_1">200_1</a>
 </h2>
 
 
 <h3>I. <i>What the Disciple should be; and concerning Common Conceptions.</i></h3>
 
 <p>Those who wish to hear about the Gods should have been well guided from
 childhood, and not habituated to foolish beliefs. They should also be in
 disposition good and sensible, that they may properly attend to the
 teaching.</p>
 
 <p>They ought also to know the Common Conceptions. Common Conceptions are
 those to which all men agree as soon as they are asked; for instance,
 that all God is good, free from passion, free from change. For whatever
 suffers change does so for the worse or the better: if for the worse, it
 is made bad; if for the better, it must have been bad at first.</p>
 
 
 <h3>II. <i>That God is unchanging, unbegotten, eternal, incorporeal, and not
 in space.</i></h3>
 
 <p>Let the disciple be thus. Let the teachings be of the following sort.
 The essences of the Gods never came into existence (for that which
 always is never comes into existence; and that exists for ever which
 possesses primary force and by nature suffers nothing): <a name="page_201"><font size="1" color="green">p. 201</font></a> neither do they
 consist of bodies; for even in bodies the powers are incorporeal.
 Neither are they contained by space; for that is a property of bodies.
 Neither are they separate from the First Cause nor from one another,
 just as thoughts are not separate from mind nor acts of knowledge from
 the soul.</p>
 
 
 <h3>III. <i>Concerning myths; that they are divine, and why.</i></h3>
 
 <p>We may well inquire, then, why the ancients forsook these doctrines and
 made use of myths. There is this first benefit from myths, that we have
 to search and do not have our minds idle.</p>
 
 <p><i>That</i> the myths are divine can be seen from those who have used them.
 Myths have been used by inspired poets, by the best of philosophers, by
 those who established the mysteries, and by the Gods themselves in
 oracles. But <i>why</i> the myths are divine it is the duty of Philosophy to
 inquire. Since all existing things rejoice in that which is like them
 and reject that which is unlike, the stories about the Gods ought to be
 like the Gods, so that they may both be worthy of the divine essence and
 make the Gods well disposed to those who speak of them: which could only
 be done by means of myths.</p>
 
 <p>Now the myths represent the Gods themselves and the goodness of the
 Gods—subject always to the distinction of the speakable and the
 unspeakable, the revealed and the unrevealed, that which is clear and
 that which is hidden: since, just as the Gods have made the goods of
 sense common to all, but those of intellect only to the wise, so the
 myths state the existence of Gods to all, but who and what they are only
 to those who can understand.</p>
 
 <p><a name="page_202"><font size="1" color="green">p. 202</font></a></p>
 <p>They also represent the activities of the Gods. For one may call the
 World a Myth, in which bodies and things are visible, but souls and
 minds hidden. Besides, to wish to teach the whole truth about the Gods
 to all produces contempt in the foolish, because they cannot understand,
 and lack of zeal in the good; whereas to conceal the truth by myths
 prevents the contempt of the foolish, and compels the good to practise
 philosophy.</p>
 
 <p>But why have they put in the myths stories of adultery, robbery,
 father-binding, and all the other absurdity? Is not that perhaps a thing
 worthy of admiration, done so that by means of the visible absurdity the
 Soul may immediately feel that the words are veils and believe the truth
 to be a mystery?</p>
 
 
 <h3>IV. <i>That the species of Myth are five, with examples of each.</i></h3>
 
 <p>Of myths some are theological, some physical, some psychic, and again
 some material, and some mixed from these last two. The theological are
 those myths which use no bodily form but contemplate the very essences
 of the Gods: e. g. Kronos swallowing his children. Since God is
 intellectual, and all intellect returns into itself, this myth expresses
 in allegory the essence of God.</p>
 
 <p>Myths may be regarded physically when they express the activities of the
 Gods in the world: e. g. people before now have regarded Kronos as Time,
 and calling the divisions of Time his sons say that the sons are
 swallowed by the father.</p>
 
 <p>The psychic way is to regard the activities of the Soul itself: the
 Soul's acts of thought, though they <a name="page_203"><font size="1" color="green">p. 203</font></a> pass on to other objects,
 nevertheless remain inside their begetters.</p>
 
 <p>The material and last is that which the Egyptians have mostly used,
 owing to their ignorance, believing material objects actually to be
 Gods, and so calling them: e. g. they call the Earth Isis, moisture
 Osiris, heat Typhon, or again, water Kronos, the fruits of the earth
 Adonis, and wine Dionysus.</p>
 
 <p>To say that these objects are sacred to the Gods, like various herbs and
 stones and animals, is possible to sensible men, but to say that they
 are gods is the notion of madmen—except, perhaps, in the sense in which
 both the orb of the sun and the ray which comes from the orb are
 colloquially called 'the Sun'.<a name="an_fr_203_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_203_1">203_1</a></p>
 
 <p>The mixed kind of myth may be seen in many instances: for example they
 say that in a banquet of the Gods Discord threw down a golden apple; the
 goddesses contended for it, and were sent by Zeus to Paris to be judged;
 Paris saw Aphrodite to be beautiful and gave her the apple. Here the
 banquet signifies the hyper-cosmic powers of the Gods; that is why they
 are all together. The golden apple is the world, which, being formed out
 of opposites, is naturally said to be 'thrown by Discord'. The different
 Gods bestow different gifts upon the world and are thus said to 'contend
 for the apple'. And the soul which lives <a name="page_204"><font size="1" color="green">p. 204</font></a> according to sense—for that
 is what Paris is—not seeing the other powers in the world but only
 beauty, declares that the apple belongs to Aphrodite.</p>
 
 <p>Theological myths suit philosophers, physical and psychic suit poets,
 mixed suit religious initiations, since every initiation aims at uniting
 us with the World and the Gods.</p>
 
 <p>To take another myth, they say that the Mother of the Gods seeing Attis
 lying by the river Gallus fell in love with him, took him, crowned him
 with her cap of stars, and thereafter kept him with her. He fell in love
 with a nymph and left the Mother to live with her. For this the Mother
 of the Gods made Attis go mad and cut off his genital organs and leave
 them with the Nymph, and then return and dwell with her.</p>
 
 <p>Now the Mother of the Gods is the principle that generates life; that is
 why she is called Mother. Attis is the creator of all things which are
 born and die; that is why he is said to have been found by the river
 Gallus. For Gallus signifies the Galaxy, or Milky Way, the point at
 which body subject to passion begins.<a name="an_fr_204_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_204_1">204_1</a> Now as the primary gods
 make perfect the secondary, the Mother loves Attis and gives him
 celestial powers. That is what the cap means. Attis loves a nymph: the
 nymphs preside over generation, since all that is generated is fluid.
 But since the process of generation must be stopped somewhere, and not
 allowed to generate something worse than the worst, the Creator who
 makes these things casts away <a name="page_205"><font size="1" color="green">p. 205</font></a> his generative powers into the creation
 and is joined to the gods again. Now these things never happened, but
 always are. And Mind sees all things at once, but Reason (or Speech)
 expresses some first and others after. Thus, as the myth is in accord
 with the Cosmos, we for that reason keep a festival imitating the
 Cosmos, for how could we attain higher order?</p>
 
 <p>And at first we ourselves, having fallen from heaven and living with the
 Nymph, are in despondency, and abstain from corn and all rich and
 unclean food, for both are hostile to the soul. Then comes the cutting
 of the tree and the fast, as though we also were cutting off the further
 process of generation. After that the feeding on milk, as though we were
 being born again; after which come rejoicings and garlands and, as it
 were, a return up to the Gods.</p>
 
 <p>The season of the ritual is evidence to the truth of these explanations.
 The rites are performed about the Vernal Equinox, when the fruits of the
 earth are ceasing to be produced, and day is becoming longer than night,
 which applies well to Spirits rising higher. (At least, the other
 equinox is in mythology the time of the Rape of Korê, which is the
 descent of the souls.)</p>
 
 <p>May these explanations of the myths find favour in the eyes of the Gods
 themselves and the souls of those who wrote the myths.</p>
 
 
 <h3>V. <i>On the First Cause.</i></h3>
 
 <p>Next in order comes knowledge of the First Cause and the subsequent
 orders of the gods, then the nature of the world, the essence of
 intellect and of soul, then Providence, Fate, and Fortune, then to <a name="page_206"><font size="1" color="green">p. 206</font></a> see
 Virtue and Vice and the various forms of social constitution good and
 bad that are formed from them, and from what possible source Evil came
 into the world.</p>
 
 <p>Each of these subjects needs many long discussions; but there is perhaps
 no harm in stating them briefly, so that a disciple may not be
 completely ignorant about them.</p>
 
 <p>It is proper to the First Cause to be One—for unity precedes
 multitude—and to surpass all things in power and goodness. Consequently
 all things must partake of it. For owing to its power nothing else can
 hinder it, and owing to its goodness it will not hold itself apart.</p>
 
 <p>If the First Cause were Soul, all things would possess Soul. If it were
 Mind, all things would possess Mind. If it were Being, all things would
 partake of Being. And seeing this quality (i. e. Being) in all things,
 some men have thought that it was Being. Now if things simply <i>were</i>,
 without being good, this argument would be true, but if things that are
 <i>are</i> because of their goodness, and partake in the good, the First
 thing must needs be both beyond-Being and good. It is strong evidence of
 this that noble souls despise Being for the sake of the good, when they
 face death for their country or friends or for the sake of
 virtue.—After this inexpressible power come the orders of the Gods.</p>
 
 
 <h3>VI. <i>On Gods Cosmic and Hypercosmic.</i></h3>
 
 <p>Of the Gods some are of the world, Cosmic, and some above the world,
 Hypercosmic. By the Cosmic I mean those who make the Cosmos. Of the
 Hypercosmic Gods some create Essence, some Mind, and <a name="page_207"><font size="1" color="green">p. 207</font></a> some Soul. Thus
 they have three orders; all of which may be found in treatises on the
 subject.</p>
 
 <p>Of the Cosmic Gods some make the World <i>be</i>, others animate it, others
 harmonize it, consisting as it does of different elements; the fourth
 class keep it when harmonized.</p>
 
 <p>These are four actions, each of which has a beginning, middle, and end,
 consequently there must be twelve gods governing the world.</p>
 
 <p>Those who make the world are Zeus, Poseidon, and Hephaistos; those who
 animate it are Demeter, Hera, and Artemis; those who harmonize it are
 Apollo, Aphrodite, and Hermes; those who watch over it are Hestia,
 Athena, and Ares.</p>
 
 <p>One can see secret suggestions of this in their images. Apollo tunes a
 lyre; Athena is armed; Aphrodite is naked (because harmony creates
 beauty, and beauty in things seen is not covered).</p>
 
 <p>While these twelve in the primary sense possess the world, we should
 consider that the other gods are contained in these. Dionysus in Zeus,
 for instance, Asklepios in Apollo, the Charites in Aphrodite.</p>
 
 <p>We can also discern their various spheres: to Hestia belongs the Earth,
 to Poseidon water, to Hera air, to Hephaistos fire. And the six superior
 spheres to the gods to whom they are usually attributed. For Apollo and
 Artemis are to be taken for the Sun and Moon, the sphere of Kronos
 should be attributed to Demeter, the ether to Athena, while the heaven
 is common to all. Thus the orders, powers, and spheres of the Twelve
 Gods have been explained and celebrated in hymns.</p>
 
 
 <p><a name="page_208"><font size="1" color="green">p. 208</font></a> </p>
 <h3>VII. <i>On the Nature of the World and its Eternity.</i></h3>
 
 <p>The Cosmos itself must of necessity be indestructible and uncreated.
 Indestructible because, suppose it destroyed: the only possibility is to
 make one better than this or worse or the same or a chaos. If worse, the
 power which out of the better makes the worse must be bad. If better,
 the maker who did not make the better at first must be imperfect in
 power. If the same, there will be no use in making it; if a chaos . . . it
 is impious even to hear such a thing suggested. These reasons would
 suffice to show that the World is also uncreated: for if not destroyed,
 neither is it created. Everything that is created is subject to
 destruction. And further, since the Cosmos exists by the goodness of God
 it follows that God must always be good and the world exist. Just as
 light coexists with the Sun and with fire, and shadow coexists with a
 body.</p>
 
 <p>Of the bodies in the Cosmos, some imitate Mind and move in orbits; some
 imitate Soul and move in a straight line, fire and air upward, earth and
 water downward. Of those that move in orbits the fixed sphere goes from
 the east, the Seven from the west. (This is so for various causes,
 especially lest the creation should be imperfect owing to the rapid
 circuit of the spheres.<a name="an_fr_208_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_208_1">208_1</a>)</p>
 
 <p>The movement being different, the nature of the bodies must also be
 different; hence the celestial <a name="page_209"><font size="1" color="green">p. 209</font></a> body does not burn or freeze what it
 touches, or do anything else that pertains to the four elements.<a name="an_fr_209_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_209_1">209_1</a></p>
 
 <p>And since the Cosmos is a sphere—the zodiac proves that—and in every
 sphere 'down' means 'towards the centre', for the centre is farthest
 distant from every point, and heavy things fall 'down' and fall to the
 earth &lt;it follows that the Earth is in the centre of the Cosmos&gt;.</p>
 
 <p>All these things are made by the Gods, ordered by Mind, moved by Soul.
 About the Gods we have spoken already.</p>
 
 
 <h3>VIII. <i>On Mind and Soul, and that the latter is immortal.</i></h3>
 
 <p>There is a certain force,<a name="an_fr_209_2"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_209_2">209_2</a> less primary than Being but more
 primary than the Soul, which draws its existence from Being and
 completes the Soul as the Sun completes the eyes. Of Souls some are
 rational and immortal, some irrational and mortal. The former are
 derived from the first Gods, the latter from the secondary.</p>
 
 <p>First, we must consider what soul is. It is, then, that by which the
 animate differs from the inanimate. The difference lies in motion,
 sensation, imagination, intelligence. Soul, therefore, when irrational,
 is the life of sense and imagination; when rational, it is the life
 which controls sense and imagination and uses reason.</p>
 
 <p>The irrational soul depends on the affections of <a name="page_210"><font size="1" color="green">p. 210</font></a> the body; it feels
 desire and anger irrationally. The rational soul both, with the help of
 reason, despises the body, and, fighting against the irrational soul,
 produces either virtue or vice, according as it is victorious or
 defeated.</p>
 
 <p>It must be immortal, both because it knows the gods (and nothing mortal
 knows<a name="an_fr_210_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_210_1">210_1</a> what is immortal), it looks down upon human affairs as
 though it stood outside them, and, like an unbodied thing, it is
 affected in the opposite way to the body. For while the body is young
 and fine, the soul blunders, but as the body grows old it attains its
 highest power. Again, every good soul uses mind; but no body can produce
 mind: for how should that which is without mind produce mind? Again,
 while Soul uses the body as an instrument, it is not in it; just as the
 engineer is not in his engines (although many engines move without being
 touched by any one). And if the Soul is often made to err by the body,
 that is not surprising. For the arts cannot perform their work when
 their instruments are spoilt.</p>
 
 
 <h3>IX. <i>On Providence, Fate, and Fortune.</i></h3>
 
 <p>This is enough to show the Providence of the Gods. For whence comes the
 ordering of the world, if there is no ordering power? And whence comes
 the fact that all things are for a purpose: e. g. irrational soul that
 there may be sensation, and rational that the earth may be set in order?</p>
 
 <p>But one can deduce the same result from the evidences of Providence in
 nature: e. g. the eyes have been made transparent with a view to seeing;
 the <a name="page_211"><font size="1" color="green">p. 211</font></a> nostrils are above the mouth to distinguish bad-smelling foods; the
 front teeth are sharp to cut food, the back teeth broad to grind it. And
 we find every part of every object arranged on a similar principle. It
 is impossible that there should be so much providence in the last
 details, and none in the first principles. Then the arts of prophecy and
 of healing, which are part of the Cosmos, come of the good providence of
 the Gods.</p>
 
 <p>All this care for the world, we must believe, is taken by the Gods
 without any act of will or labour. As bodies which possess some power
 produce their effects by merely existing: e. g. the sun gives light and
 heat by merely existing; so, and far more so, the Providence of the Gods
 acts without effort to itself and for the good of the objects of its
 forethought. This solves the problems of the Epicureans, who argue that
 what is Divine neither has trouble itself nor gives trouble to others.</p>
 
 <p>The incorporeal providence of the Gods, both for bodies and for souls,
 is of this sort; but that which is of bodies and in bodies is different
 from this, and is called Fate, Heimarmenê, because the chain of causes
 (Heirmos) is more visible in the case of bodies; and it is for dealing
 with this Fate that the science of 'Mathematic' has been
 discovered.<a name="an_fr_211_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_211_1">211_1</a></p>
 
 <p>Therefore, to believe that human things, especially their material
 constitution, are ordered not only by celestial beings but by the
 Celestial Bodies, is a reasonable and true belief. Reason shows that
 health and sickness, good fortune and bad fortune, arise according to
 our deserts from that source. But to attribute men's acts of injustice
 and lust to Fate, is <a name="page_212"><font size="1" color="green">p. 212</font></a> to make ourselves good and the Gods bad. Unless by
 chance a man meant by such a statement that in general all things are
 for the good of the world and for those who are in a natural state, but
 that bad education or weakness of nature changes the goods of Fate for
 the worse. Just as it happens that the Sun, which is good for all, may
 be injurious to persons with ophthalmia or fever. Else why do the
 Massagetae eat their fathers, the Hebrews practise circumcision, and the
 Persians preserve rules of rank?<a name="an_fr_212_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_212_1">212_1</a> Why do astrologers, while
 calling Saturn and Mars 'malignant', proceed to make them good,
 attributing to them philosophy and royalty, generalships and treasures?
 And if they are going to talk of triangles and squares, it is absurd
 that gods should change their natures according to their position in
 space, while human virtue remains the same everywhere. Also the fact
 that the stars predict high or low rank for the father of the person
 whose horoscope is taken, teaches that they do not always make things
 happen but sometimes only indicate things. For how could things which
 preceded the birth depend upon the birth?</p>
 
 <p>Further, as there is Providence and Fate concerned with nations and
 cities, and also concerned with each individual, so there is also
 Fortune, which should next be treated. That power of the gods which
 orders for the good things which are not uniform, and which happen
 contrary to expectation, is commonly called Fortune, and it is for this
 reason that the goddess is especially worshipped in public by cities;
 for every city consists of elements which are not uniform. <a name="page_213"><font size="1" color="green">p. 213</font></a> Fortune has
 power beneath the moon, since above the moon no single thing can happen
 by fortune.</p>
 
 <p>If Fortune makes a wicked man prosperous and a good man poor, there is
 no need to wonder. For the wicked regard wealth as everything, the good
 as nothing. And the good fortune of the bad cannot take away their
 badness, while virtue alone will be enough for the good.</p>
 
 
 <h3>X. <i>Concerning Virtue and Vice.</i></h3>
 
 <p>The doctrine of Virtue and Vice depends on that of the Soul. When the
 irrational soul enters into the body and immediately produces Fight and
 Desire, the rational soul, put in authority over all these, makes the
 soul tripartite, composed of Reason, Fight, and Desire. Virtue in the
 region of Reason is Wisdom, in the region of Fight is Courage, in the
 region of Desire it is Temperance: the virtue of the whole Soul is
 Righteousness. It is for Reason to judge what is right, for Fight in
 obedience to Reason to despise things that appear terrible, for Desire
 to pursue not the apparently desirable, but, that which is with Reason
 desirable. When these things are so, we have a righteous life; for
 righteousness in matters of property is but a small part of virtue. And
 thus we shall find all four virtues in properly trained men, but among
 the untrained one may be brave and unjust, another temperate and stupid,
 another prudent and unprincipled. Indeed these qualities should not be
 called Virtues when they are devoid of Reason and imperfect and found in
 irrational beings. Vice should be regarded as consisting of the opposite
 elements. In <a name="page_214"><font size="1" color="green">p. 214</font></a> Reason it is Folly, in Fight, Cowardice, in Desire,
 Intemperance, in the whole soul, Unrighteousness.</p>
 
 <p>The virtues are produced by the right social organization and by good
 rearing and education, the vices by the opposite.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XI. <i>Concerning right and wrong Social Organization.</i><a name="an_fr_214_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_214_1">214_1</a></h3>
 
 <p>Constitutions also depend on the tripartite nature of the Soul. The
 rulers are analogous to Reason, the soldiers to Fight, the common folk
 to Desires.</p>
 
 <p>Where all things are done according to Reason and the best man in the
 nation rules, it is a Kingdom; where more than one rule according to
 Reason and Fight, it is an Aristocracy; where the government is
 according to Desire and offices depend on money, that constitution is
 called a Timocracy. The contraries are: to Kingdom tyranny, for Kingdom
 does all things with the guidance of reason and tyranny nothing; to
 Aristocracy oligarchy, when not the best people but a few of the worst
 are rulers; to Timocracy democracy, when not the rich but the common
 folk possess the whole power.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XII. <i>The origin of evil things; and that there is no positive evil.</i></h3>
 
 <p>The Gods being good and making all things, how do evils exist in the
 world? Or perhaps it is better first to state the fact that, the Gods
 being good and making all things, there is no positive evil, it only
 comes by <a name="page_215"><font size="1" color="green">p. 215</font></a> absence of good; just as darkness itself does not exist, but
 only comes about by absence of light.</p>
 
 <p>If Evil exists it must exist either in Gods or minds or souls or bodies.
 It does not exist in any god, for all god is good. If any one speaks of
 a 'bad mind' he means a mind without mind. If of a bad soul, he will
 make soul inferior to body, for no body in itself is evil. If he says
 that Evil is made up of soul and body together, it is absurd that
 separately they should not be evil, but joined should create evil.</p>
 
 <p>Suppose it is said that there are evil spirits:—if they have their
 power from the gods, they cannot be evil; if from elsewhere, the gods do
 not make all things. If they do not make all things, then either they
 wish to and cannot, or they can and do not wish; neither of which is
 consistent with the idea of God. We may see, therefore, from these
 arguments, that there is no positive evil in the world.</p>
 
 <p>It is in the activities of men that the evils appear, and that not of
 all men nor always. And as to these, if men sinned for the sake of evil,
 Nature itself would be evil. But if the adulterer thinks his adultery
 bad but his pleasure good, and the murderer thinks the murder bad but
 the money he gets by it good, and the man who does evil to an enemy
 thinks that to do evil is bad but to punish his enemy good, and if the
 soul commits all its sins in that way, then the evils are done for the
 sake of goodness. (In the same way, because in a given place light does
 not exist, there comes darkness, which has no positive existence.) The
 soul sins therefore because, while aiming at good, it makes mistakes
 about the good, because it is not Primary Essence. And we see many
 things done by the Gods to prevent <a name="page_216"><font size="1" color="green">p. 216</font></a> it from making mistakes and to heal
 it when it has made them. Arts and sciences, curses and prayers,
 sacrifices and initiations, laws and constitutions, judgements and
 punishments, all came into existence for the sake of preventing souls
 from sinning; and when they are gone forth from the body gods and
 spirits of purification cleanse them of their sins.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XIII. <i>How things eternal are said to 'be made'</i> (<ins class="greek" title="gignesthai">γίγνεσθαι</ins>).</h3>
 
 <p>Concerning the Gods and the World and human things this account will
 suffice for those who are not able to go through the whole course of
 philosophy but yet have not souls beyond help.</p>
 
 <p>It remains to explain how these objects were never made and are never
 separated one from another, since we ourselves have said above that the
 secondary substances were 'made' by the first.</p>
 
 <p>Everything made is made either by art or by a physical process or
 according to some power.<a name="an_fr_216_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_216_1">216_1</a>
 
 Now in art or nature the maker must
 needs be prior to the made: but the maker, according to power,
 constitutes the made absolutely together with itself, since its power is
 inseparable from it; as the sun makes light, fire makes heat, snow makes
 cold.</p>
 
 
 Now in art or nature the maker must
 needs be prior to the made: but the maker, according to power,
 constitutes the made absolutely together with itself, since its power is
 inseparable from it; as the sun makes light, fire makes heat, snow makes
 cold.
 
 <p>Now if the Gods make the world by art, they do not make it <i>be</i>, they
 make it <i>be such as it is</i>. For all art makes the form of the object.
 What therefore makes it to be?</p>
 
 <p>If by a physical process, how in that case can the maker help giving
 part of himself to the made? As <a name="page_217"><font size="1" color="green">p. 217</font></a> the Gods are incorporeal, the World
 ought to be incorporeal too. If it were argued that the Gods were
 bodies, then where would the power of incorporeal things come from? And
 if we were to admit it, it would follow that when the world decays, its
 maker must be decaying too, if he is a maker by physical process.</p>
 
 <p>If the Gods make the world neither by art nor by physical process, it
 only remains that they make it by power. Everything so made subsists
 together with that which possesses the power. Neither can things so made
 be destroyed, except the power of the maker be taken away: so that those
 who believe in the destruction of the world, either deny the existence
 of the gods, or, while admitting it, deny God's power.</p>
 
 <p>Therefore he who makes all things by his own power makes all things
 subsist together with himself. And since his power is the greatest power
 he must needs be the maker not only of men and animals, but of Gods,
 men, and spirits.<a name="an_fr_217_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_217_1">217_1</a> And the further removed the First God is from
 our nature, the more powers there must be between us and him. For all
 things that are very far apart have many intermediate points between
 them.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XIV. <i>In what sense, though the Gods never change, they are said to be
 made angry and appeased.</i></h3>
 
 <p>If any one thinks the doctrine of the unchangeableness of the Gods is
 reasonable and true, and then wonders how it is that they rejoice in the
 good and reject the bad, are angry with sinners and become propitious
 when appeased, the answer is as follows: <a name="page_218"><font size="1" color="green">p. 218</font></a> God does not rejoice—for that
 which rejoices also grieves; nor is he angered—for to be angered is a
 passion; nor is he appeased by gifts—if he were, he would be conquered
 by pleasure.</p>
 
 <p>It is impious to suppose that the Divine is affected for good or ill by
 human things. The Gods are always good and always do good and never
 harm, being always in the same state and like themselves. The truth
 simply is that, when we are good, we are joined to the Gods by our
 likeness to them; when bad, we are separated from them by our
 unlikeness. And when we live according to virtue we cling to the gods,
 and when we become evil we make the gods our enemies—not because they
 are angered against us, but because our sins prevent the light of the
 gods from shining upon us, and put us in communion with spirits of
 punishment. And if by prayers and sacrifices we find forgiveness of
 sins, we do not appease or change the gods, but by what we do and by our
 turning towards the Divine we heal our own badness and so enjoy again
 the goodness of the gods. To say that God turns away from the evil is
 like saying that the sun hides himself from the blind.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XV. <i>Why we give worship to the Gods when they need nothing.</i></h3>
 
 <p>This solves the question about sacrifices and other rites performed to
 the Gods. The Divine itself is without needs, and the worship is paid
 for our own benefit. The providence of the Gods reaches everywhere and
 needs only some congruity<a name="an_fr_218_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_218_1">218_1</a> for its reception. All congruity comes
 about by representation <a name="page_219"><font size="1" color="green">p. 219</font></a> and likeness; for which reason the temples are
 made in representation of heaven, the altar of earth, the images of life
 (that is why they are made like living things), the prayers of the
 element of thought, the mystic letters<a name="an_fr_219_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_219_1">219_1</a> of the unspeakable
 celestial forces, the herbs and stones of matter, and the sacrificial
 animals of the irrational life in us.</p>
 
 <p>From all these things the Gods gain nothing; what gain could there be to
 God? It is we who gain some communion with them.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XVI. <i>Concerning sacrifices and other worships, that we benefit man by
 them, but not the gods.</i></h3>
 
 <p>I think it well to add some remarks about sacrifices. In the first
 place, since we have received everything from the gods, and it is right
 to pay the giver some tithe of his gifts, we pay such a tithe of
 possessions in votive offerings, of bodies in gifts of &lt;hair and&gt; adornment, and
 of life in sacrifices. Then secondly, prayers without sacrifices are
 only words, with sacrifices they are live words; the word gives meaning
 to the life, while the life animates the word. Thirdly, the happiness of
 every object is its own perfection; and perfection for each is communion
 with its own cause. For this reason we pray for communion with the Gods.
 Since, therefore, the first life is the life of the gods, but human life
 is also life of a kind, and human life wishes for communion with divine
 life, a mean term is needed. For things very far apart cannot have
 communion without a mean term, and the mean term must be like the things
 joined; therefore <a name="page_220"><font size="1" color="green">p. 220</font></a> the mean term between life and life must be life.
 That is why men sacrifice animals; only the rich do so now, but in old
 days everybody did, and that not indiscriminately, but giving the
 suitable offerings to each god together with a great deal of other
 worship. Enough of this subject.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XVII. <i>That the World is by nature Eternal.</i></h3>
 
 <p>We have shown above that the gods will not destroy the world. It remains
 to show that its nature is indestructible.</p>
 
 <p>Everything that is destroyed is either destroyed by itself or by
 something else. If the world is destroyed by itself, fire must needs
 burn itself and water dry itself. If by something else, it must be
 either by a body or by something incorporeal. By something incorporeal
 is impossible; for incorporeal things preserve bodies—nature, for
 instance, and soul—and nothing is destroyed by a cause whose nature is
 to preserve it. If it is destroyed by some body, it must be either by
 those which exist or by others.</p>
 
 <p>If by those which exist: then either those moving in a straight line
 must be destroyed by those that revolve, or vice versa. But those that
 revolve have no destructive nature; else, why do we never see anything
 destroyed from that cause? Nor yet can those which are moving straight
 touch the others; else, why have they never been able to do so yet?</p>
 
 <p>But neither can those moving straight be destroyed by one another: for
 the destruction of one is the creation of another; and that is not to be
 destroyed but to change.</p>
 
 <p>But if the World is to be destroyed by other bodies <a name="page_221"><font size="1" color="green">p. 221</font></a> than these it is
 impossible to say where such bodies are or whence they are to arise.</p>
 
 <p>Again, everything destroyed is destroyed either in form or matter. (Form
 is the shape of a thing, matter the body.) Now if the form is destroyed
 and the matter remains, we see other things come into being. If matter
 is destroyed, how is it that the supply has not failed in all these
 years?</p>
 
 <p>If when matter is destroyed other matter takes its place, the new matter
 must come either from something that is or from something that is not.
 If from that-which-is, as long as that-which-is always remains, matter
 always remains. But if that-which-is is destroyed, such a theory means
 that not the World only but everything in the universe is destroyed.</p>
 
 <p>If again matter comes from that-which-is-not: in the first place, it is
 impossible for anything to come from that which is not; but suppose it
 to happen, and that matter did arise from that which is not; then, as
 long as there are things which are not, matter will exist. For I presume
 there can never be an end of things which are not.</p>
 
 <p>If they say that matter &lt;will become&gt; formless: in the first place, why does this
 happen to the world as a whole when it does not happen to any part?
 Secondly, by this hypothesis they do not destroy the being of bodies,
 but only their beauty.</p>
 
 <p>Further, everything destroyed is either resolved into the elements from
 which it came, or else vanishes into not-being. If things are resolved
 into the elements from which they came, then there will be others: else
 how did they come into being at all? If that-which-is is to depart into
 not-being, what prevents that happening <a name="page_222"><font size="1" color="green">p. 222</font></a> to God himself? (Which is
 absurd.) Or if God's power prevents that, it is not a mark of power to
 be able to save nothing but oneself. And it is equally impossible for
 that-which-is to come out of nothing and to depart into nothing.</p>
 
 <p>Again, if the World is destroyed, it must needs either be destroyed
 according to Nature or against Nature. Against Nature is impossible, for
 that which is against nature is not stronger than Nature.<a name="an_fr_222_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_222_1">222_1</a> If
 according to Nature, there must be another Nature which changes the
 Nature of the World: which does not appear.</p>
 
 <p>Again, anything that is naturally destructible we can ourselves destroy.
 But no one has ever destroyed or altered the round body of the World.
 And the elements, though they can be changed, cannot be destroyed.
 Again, everything destructible is changed by time and grows old. But the
 world through all these years has remained utterly unchanged.</p>
 
 <p>Having said so much for the help of those who feel the need of very
 strong demonstrations, I pray the World himself to be gracious to me.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XVIII. <i>Why there are rejections of God, and that God is not injured.</i></h3>
 
 <p>Nor need the fact that rejections of God have taken place in certain
 parts of the earth and will often take place hereafter, disturb the mind
 of the wise: both because these things do not affect the gods, just as
 we saw that worship did not benefit them; and because the soul, being of
 middle essence, cannot be <a name="page_223"><font size="1" color="green">p. 223</font></a> always right; and because the whole world
 cannot enjoy the providence of the gods equally, but some parts may
 partake of it eternally, some at certain times, some in the primal
 manner, some in the secondary. Just as the head enjoys all the senses,
 but the rest of the body only one.</p>
 
 <p>For this reason, it seems, those who ordained Festivals ordained also
 Forbidden Days, in which some temples lay idle, some were shut, some had
 their adornment removed, in expiation of the weakness of our nature.</p>
 
 <p>It is not unlikely, too, that the rejection of God is a kind of
 punishment: we may well believe that those who knew the gods and
 neglected them in one life may in another life be deprived of the
 knowledge of them altogether. Also those who have worshipped their own
 kings as gods have deserved as their punishment to lose all knowledge of
 God.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XIX. <i>Why sinners are not punished at once.</i></h3>
 
 <p>There is no need to be surprised if neither these sins nor yet others
 bring immediate punishment upon sinners. For it is not only
 Spirits<a name="an_fr_223_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_223_1">223_1</a> who punish the soul, the Soul brings itself to judgement:
 and also it is not right for those who endure for ever to attain
 everything in a short time: and also, there is need of human virtue. If
 punishment followed instantly upon sin, men would act justly from fear
 and have no virtue.</p>
 
 <p>Souls are punished when they have gone forth from the body, some
 wandering among us, some going to hot or cold places of the earth, some
 harassed by Spirits. Under all circumstances they suffer with the
 <a name="page_224"><font size="1" color="green">p. 224</font></a> irrational part of their nature, with which they also sinned. For its
 sake<a name="an_fr_224_1"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_224_1">224_1</a> there subsist that shadowy body which is seen about graves,
 especially the graves of evil livers.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XX. <i>On Transmigration of Souls, and how Souls are said to migrate into
 brute beasts.</i></h3>
 
 <p>If the transmigration of a soul takes place into a rational being, it
 simply becomes the soul of that body. But if the soul migrates into a
 brute beast, it follows the body outside, as a guardian spirit follows a
 man. For there could never be a rational soul in an irrational being.</p>
 
 <p>The transmigration of souls can be proved from the congenital
 afflictions of persons. For why are some born blind, others paralytic,
 others with some sickness in the soul itself? Again, it is the natural
 duty of Souls to do their work in the body; are we to suppose that when
 once they leave the body they spend all eternity in idleness?</p>
 
 <p>Again, if the souls did not again enter into bodies, they must either be
 infinite in number or God must constantly be making new ones. But there
 is nothing infinite in the world; for in a finite whole there cannot be
 an infinite part. Neither can others be made; for everything in which
 something new goes on being created, must be imperfect. And the World,
 being made by a perfect author, ought naturally to be perfect.</p>
 
 
 <h3>XXI. <i>That the Good are happy, both living and dead.</i></h3>
 
 <p>Souls that have lived in virtue are in general happy,<a name="an_fr_224_2"></a><a href="fsgr10.htm#an_fn_224_2">224_2</a> <a name="page_225"><font size="1" color="green">p. 225</font></a> and when
 separated from the irrational part of their nature, and made clean from
 all matter, have communion with the gods and join them in the governing
 of the whole world. Yet even if none of this happiness fell to their
 lot, virtue itself, and the joy and glory of virtue, and the life that
 is subject to no grief and no master are enough to make happy those who
 have set themselves to live according to virtue and have achieved it.</p>
