 <p>     Elevation Of Timour Or Tamerlane To The Throne Of Samarcand. - His Conquests In Persia, Georgia, Tartary Russia, India, Syria, And Anatolia. - His Turkish War. - Defeat And Captivity Of Bajazet. - Death Of Timour. - Civil War Of The Sons Of Bajazet. - Restoration Of The Turkish Monarchy By Mahomet The First. - Siege Of Constantinople By Amurath The Second.  </p> 
 <p>     The conquest and monarchy of the world was the first object of the ambition of Timour.  To live in the memory and esteem of future ages was the second wish of his magnanimous spirit.  All the civil and military transactions of his reign were diligently recorded in the journals of his secretaries:  <a name="fr_549"></a><a href="#fn_549"><font size="1">1</font></a> the authentic narrative was revised by the persons best informed of each particular transaction; and it is believed in the empire and family of Timour, that the monarch himself composed the commentaries  <a name="fr_550"></a><a href="#fn_550"><font size="1">2</font></a> of his life, and the institutions  <a name="fr_551"></a><a href="#fn_551"><font size="1">3</font></a> of his government.  <a name="fr_552"></a><a href="#fn_552"><font size="1">4</font></a> But these cares were ineffectual for the preservation of his fame, and these precious memorials in the Mogul or Persian language were concealed from the world, or, at least, from the knowledge of Europe.  The nations which he vanquished exercised a base and impotent revenge; and ignorance has long repeated the tale of calumny,  <a name="fr_553"></a><a href="#fn_553"><font size="1">5</font></a> which had disfigured the birth and character, the person, and even the name, of Tamerlane.  <a name="fr_554"></a><a href="#fn_554"><font size="1">6</font></a> Yet his real merit would be enhanced, rather than debased, by the elevation of a peasant to the throne of Asia; nor can his lameness be a theme of reproach, unless he had the weakness to blush at a natural, or perhaps an honorable, infirmity.  <a name="fr_555"></a><a href="#fn_555"><font size="1">*_0041</font></a> </p>

        In the eyes of the Moguls, who held the indefeasible succession of the house of Zingis, he was doubtless a rebel subject; yet he sprang from the noble tribe of Berlass: his fifth ancestor, Carashar Nevian, had been the vizier  <a name="fr_556"></a><a href="#fn_556"><font size="1">!_0042</font></a> of Zagatai, in his new realm of Transoxiana; and in the ascent of some generations, the branch of Timour is confounded, at least by the females,  <a name="fr_557"></a><a href="#fn_557"><font size="1">7</font></a> with the Imperial stem.  <a name="fr_558"></a><a href="#fn_558"><font size="1">8</font></a> He was born forty miles to the south of Samarcand in the village of Sebzar, in the fruitful territory of Cash, of which his fathers were the hereditary chiefs, as well as of a toman of ten thousand horse.  <a name="fr_559"></a><a href="#fn_559"><font size="1">9</font></a> His birth  <a name="fr_560"></a><a href="#fn_560"><font size="1">10</font></a> was cast on one of those periods of anarchy, which announce the fall of the Asiatic dynasties, and open a new field to adventurous ambition.  The khans of Zagatai were extinct; the emirs aspired to independence; and their domestic feuds could only be suspended by the conquest and tyranny of the khans of Kashgar, who, with an army of Getes or Calmucks,  <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">11</font></a> invaded the Transoxian kingdom.  From the twelfth year of his age, Timour had entered the field of action; in the twenty-fifth  <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">!!_0042</font></a> he stood forth as the deliverer of his country; and the eyes and wishes of the people were turned towards a hero who suffered in their cause.  The chiefs of the law and of the army had pledged their salvation to support him with their lives and fortunes; but in the hour of danger they were silent and afraid; and, after waiting seven days on the hills of Samarcand, he retreated to the desert with only sixty horsemen.  The fugitives were overtaken by a thousand Getes, whom he repulsed with incredible slaughter, and his enemies were forced to exclaim, "Timour is a wonderful man: fortune and the divine favor are with him." But in this bloody action his own followers were reduced to ten, a number which was soon diminished by the desertion of three Carizmians.  <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">!!!_0042</font></a> He wandered in the desert with his wife, seven companions, and four horses; and sixty-two days was he plunged in a loathsome dungeon, from whence he escaped by his own courage and the remorse of the oppressor.  After swimming the broad and rapid steam of the Jihoon, or Oxus, he led, during some months, the life of a vagrant and outlaw, on the borders of the adjacent states.  But his fame shone brighter in adversity; he learned to distinguish the friends of his person, the associates of his fortune, and to apply the various characters of men for their advantage, and, above all, for his own. On his return to his native country, Timour was successively joined by the parties of his confederates, who anxiously sought him in the desert; nor can I refuse to describe, in his pathetic simplicity, one of their fortunate encounters.  He presented himself as a guide to three chiefs, who were at the head of seventy horse.  "When their eyes fell upon me," says Timour, "they were overwhelmed with joy; and they alighted from their horses; and they came and kneeled; and they kissed my stirrup.  I also came down from my horse, and took each of them in my arms. And I put my turban on the head of the first chief; and my girdle, rich in jewels and wrought with gold, I bound on the loins of the second; and the third I clothed in my own coat.  And they wept, and I wept also; and the hour of prayer was arrived, and we prayed.  And we mounted our horses, and came to my dwelling; and I collected my people, and made a feast." His trusty bands were soon increased by the bravest of the tribes; he led them against a superior foe; and, after some vicissitudes of war the Getes were finally driven from the kingdom of Transoxiana.  He had done much for his own glory; but much remained to be done, much art to be exerted, and some blood to be spilt, before he could teach his equals to obey him as their master.  The birth and power of emir Houssein compelled him to accept a vicious and unworthy colleague, whose sister was the best beloved of his wives.  Their union was short and jealous; but the policy of Timour, in their frequent quarrels, exposed his rival to the reproach of injustice and perfidy; and, after a final defeat, Houssein was slain by some sagacious friends, who presumed, for the last time, to disobey the commands of their lord.  <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">*_0042</font></a> At the age of thirty-four,  <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">12</font></a> and in a general diet or couroultai, he was invested with Imperial command, but he affected to revere the house of Zingis; and while the emir Timour reigned over Zagatai and the East, a nominal khan served as a private officer in the armies of his servant.  A fertile kingdom, five hundred miles in length and in breadth, might have satisfied the ambition of a subject; but Timour aspired to the dominion of the world; and before his death, the crown of Zagatai was one of the twenty- seven crowns which he had placed on his head.  Without expatiating on the victories of thirty-five campaigns; without describing the lines of march, which he repeatedly traced over the continent of Asia; I shall briefly represent his conquests in, I. Persia, II. Tartary, and, III. India,  <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">13</font></a> and from thence proceed to the more interesting narrative of his Ottoman war. </p>

 <p>     I.  For every war, a motive of safety or revenge, of honor or zeal, of right or convenience, may be readily found in the jurisprudence of conquerors. No sooner had Timour reunited to the patrimony of Zagatai the dependent countries of Carizme and Candahar, than he turned his eyes towards the kingdoms of Iran or Persia.  From the Oxus to the Tigris, that extensive country was left without a lawful sovereign since the death of Abousaid, the last of the descendants of the great Holacou.  Peace and justice had been banished from the land above forty years; and the Mogul invader might seem to listen to the cries of an oppressed people.  Their petty tyrants might have opposed him with confederate arms: they separately stood, and successively fell; and the difference of their fate was only marked by the promptitude of submission or the obstinacy of resistance.  Ibrahim, prince of Shirwan, or Albania, kissed the footstool of the Imperial throne.  His peace-offerings of silks, horses, and jewels, were composed, according to the Tartar fashion, each article of nine pieces; but a critical spectator observed, that there were only eight slaves.  "I myself am the ninth," replied Ibrahim, who was prepared for the remark; and his flattery was rewarded by the smile of Timour.  <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">14</font></a> Shah Mansour, prince of Fars, or the proper Persia, was one of the least powerful, but most dangerous, of his enemies.  In a battle under the walls of Shiraz, he broke, with three or four thousand soldiers, the coul or main body of thirty thousand horse, where the emperor fought in person. No more than fourteen or fifteen guards remained near the standard of Timour: he stood firm as a rock, and received on his helmet two weighty strokes of a cimeter:  <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">15</font></a> the Moguls rallied; the head of Mansour was thrown at his feet; and he declared his esteem of the valor of a foe, by extirpating all the males of so intrepid a race.  From Shiraz, his troops advanced to the Persian Gulf; and the richness and weakness of Ormuz  <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">16</font></a> were displayed in an annual tribute of six hundred thousand dinars of gold.  Bagdad was no longer the city of peace, the seat of the caliphs; but the noblest conquest of Holacou could not be overlooked by his ambitious successor.  The whole course of the Tigris and Euphrates, from the mouth to the sources of those rivers, was reduced to his obedience: he entered Edessa; and the Turkmans of the black sheep were chastised for the sacrilegious pillage of a caravan of Mecca.  In the mountains of Georgia, the native Christians still braved the law and the sword of Mahomet, by three expeditions he obtained the merit of the gazie, or holy war; and the prince of Teflis became his proselyte and friend.

 <p>     II.  A just retaliation might be urged for the invasion of Turkestan, or the Eastern Tartary.  The dignity of Timour could not endure the impunity of the Getes: he passed the Sihoon, subdued the kingdom of Kashgar, and marched seven times into the heart of their country.  His most distant camp was two months' journey, or four hundred and eighty leagues to the north-east of Samarcand; and his emirs, who traversed the River Irtish, engraved in the forests of Siberia a rude memorial of their exploits.  The conquest of Kipzak, or the Western Tartary,  <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">17</font></a> was founded on the double motive of aiding the distressed, and chastising the ungrateful.  Toctamish, a fugitive prince, was entertained and protected in his court: the ambassadors of Auruss Khan were dismissed with a haughty denial, and followed on the same day by the armies of Zagatai; and their success established Toctamish in the Mogul empire of the North.  But, after a reign of ten years, the new khan forgot the merits and the strength of his benefactor; the base usurper, as he deemed him, of the sacred rights of the house of Zingis.  Through the gates of Derbend, he entered Persia at the head of ninety thousand horse: with the innumerable forces of Kipzak, Bulgaria, Circassia, and Russia, he passed the Sihoon, burnt the palaces of Timour, and compelled him, amidst the winter snows, to contend for Samarcand and his life.  After a mild expostulation, and a glorious victory, the emperor resolved on revenge; and by the east, and the west, of the Caspian, and the Volga, he twice invaded Kipzak with such mighty powers, that thirteen miles were measured from his right to his left wing.  In a march of five months, they rarely beheld the footsteps of man; and their daily subsistence was often trusted to the fortune of the chase. At length the armies encountered each other; but the treachery of the standard-bearer, who, in the heat of action, reversed the Imperial standard of Kipzak, determined the victory of the Zagatais; and Toctamish (I peak the language of the Institutions) gave the tribe of Toushi to the wind of desolation.  <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">18</font></a> He fled to the Christian duke of Lithuania; again returned to the banks of the Volga; and, after fifteen battles with a domestic rival, at last perished in the wilds of Siberia.  The pursuit of a flying enemy carried Timour into the tributary provinces of Russia: a duke of the reigning family was made prisoner amidst the ruins of his capital; and Yeletz, by the pride and ignorance of the Orientals, might easily be confounded with the genuine metropolis of the nation.  Moscow trembled at the approach of the Tartar, and the resistance would have been feeble, since the hopes of the Russians were placed in a miraculous image of the Virgin, to whose protection they ascribed the casual and voluntary retreat of the conqueror.  Ambition and prudence recalled him to the South, the desolate country was exhausted, and the Mogul soldiers were enriched with an immense spoil of precious furs, of linen of Antioch,  <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">19</font></a> and of ingots of gold and silver.  <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">20</font></a> On the banks of the Don, or Tanais, he received an humble deputation from the consuls and merchants of Egypt,  <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">21</font></a> Venice, Genoa, Catalonia, and Biscay, who occupied the commerce and city of Tana, or Azoph, at the mouth of the river.  They offered their gifts, admired his magnificence, and trusted his royal word.  But the peaceful visit of an emir, who explored the state of the magazines and harbor, was speedily followed by the destructive presence of the Tartars. The city was reduced to ashes; the Moslems were pillaged and dismissed; but all the Christians, who had not fled to their ships, were condemned either to death or slavery.  <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">22</font></a> Revenge prompted him to burn the cities of Serai and Astrachan, the monuments of rising civilization; and his vanity proclaimed, that he had penetrated to the region of perpetual daylight, a strange phenomenon, which authorized his Mahometan doctors to dispense with the obligation of evening prayer.  <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">23</font></a>

  </p> 
 <p>     III.  When Timour first proposed to his princes and emirs the invasion of India or Hindostan,  <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">24</font></a> he was answered by a murmur of discontent: "The rivers!  and the mountains and deserts!  and the soldiers clad in armor!  and the elephants, destroyers of men!" But the displeasure of the emperor was more dreadful than all these terrors; and his superior reason was convinced, that an enterprise of such tremendous aspect was safe and easy in the execution. He was informed by his spies of the weakness and anarchy of Hindostan: the soubahs of the provinces had erected the standard of rebellion; and the perpetual infancy of Sultan Mahmoud was despised even in the harem of Delhi. The Mogul army moved in three great divisions; and Timour observes with pleasure, that the ninety-two squadrons of a thousand horse most fortunately corresponded with the ninety-two names or epithets of the prophet Mahomet.  <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">*_0043</font></a> Between the Jihoon and the Indus they crossed one of the ridges of mountains, which are styled by the Arabian geographers The Stony Girdles of the Earth. The highland robbers were subdued or extirpated; but great numbers of men and horses perished in the snow; the emperor himself was let down a precipice on a portable scaffold - the ropes were one hundred and fifty cubits in length; and before he could reach the bottom, this dangerous operation was five times repeated.  Timour crossed the Indus at the ordinary passage of Attok; and successively traversed, in the footsteps of Alexander, the Punjab, or five rivers,  <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">25</font></a> that fall into the master stream. From Attok to Delhi, the high road measures no more than six hundred miles; but the two conquerors deviated to the south-east; and the motive of Timour was to join his grandson, who had achieved by his command the conquest of Moultan.  On the eastern bank of the Hyphasis, on the edge of the desert, the Macedonian hero halted and wept: the Mogul entered the desert, reduced the fortress of Batmir, and stood in arms before the gates of Delhi, a great and flourishing city, which had subsisted three centuries under the dominion of the Mahometan kings.  <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">!_0043</font></a> The siege, more especially of the castle, might have been a work of time; but he tempted, by the appearance of weakness, the sultan Mahmoud and his vizier to descend into the plain, with ten thousand cuirassiers, forty thousand of his foot-guards, and one hundred and twenty elephants, whose tusks are said to have been armed with sharp and poisoned daggers.  Against these monsters, or rather against the imagination of his troops, he condescended to use some extraordinary precautions of fire and a ditch, of iron spikes and a rampart of bucklers; but the event taught the Moguls to smile at their own fears; and as soon as these unwieldy animals were routed, the inferior species (the men of India) disappeared from the field.  Timour made his triumphal entry into the capital of Hindostan; and admired, with a view to imitate, the architecture of the stately mosque; but the order or license of a general pillage and massacre polluted the festival of his victory.  He resolved to purify his soldiers in the blood of the idolaters, or Gentoos, who still surpass, in the proportion of ten to one, the numbers of the Moslems.  <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">**_0043</font></a> In this pious design, he advanced one hundred miles to the north-east of Delhi, passed the Ganges, fought several battles by land and water, and penetrated to the famous rock of Coupele, the statue of the cow,  <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">!!_0043</font></a> that seems to discharge the mighty river, whose source is far distant among the mountains of Thibet.  <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">26</font></a> His return was along the skirts of the northern hills; nor could this rapid campaign of one year justify the strange foresight of his emirs, that their children in a warm climate would degenerate into a race of Hindoos. </p>

 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
   
        It was on the banks of the Ganges that Timour was informed, by his speedy messengers, of the disturbances which had arisen on the confines of Georgia and Anatolia, of the revolt of the Christians, and the ambitious designs of the sultan Bajazet.  His vigor of mind and body was not impaired by sixty-three years, and innumerable fatigues; and, after enjoying some tranquil months in the palace of Samarcand, he proclaimed a new expedition of seven years into the western countries of Asia.  <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">27</font></a> To the soldiers who had served in the Indian war he granted the choice of remaining at home, or following their prince; but the troops of all the provinces and kingdoms of Persia were commanded to assemble at Ispahan, and wait the arrival of the Imperial standard.  It was first directed against the Christians of Georgia, who were strong only in their rocks, their castles, and the winter season; but these obstacles were overcome by the zeal and perseverance of Timour: the rebels submitted to the tribute or the Koran; and if both religions boasted of their martyrs, that name is more justly due to the Christian prisoners, who were offered the choice of abjuration or death.  On his descent from the hills, the emperor gave audience to the first ambassadors of Bajazet, and opened the hostile correspondence of complaints and menaces, which fermented two years before the final explosion.  Between two jealous and haughty neighbors, the motives of quarrel will seldom be wanting.  The Mogul and Ottoman conquests now touched each other in the neighborhood of Erzerum, and the Euphrates; nor had the doubtful limit been ascertained by time and treaty.  Each of these ambitious monarchs might accuse his rival of violating his territory, of threatening his vassals, and protecting his rebels; and, by the name of rebels, each understood the fugitive princes, whose kingdoms he had usurped, and whose life or liberty he implacably pursued.  The resemblance of character was still more dangerous than the opposition of interest; and in their victorious career, Timour was impatient of an equal, and Bajazet was ignorant of a superior.  The first epistle  <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">28</font></a> of the Mogul emperor must have provoked, instead of reconciling, the Turkish sultan, whose family and nation he affected to despise.  <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">29</font></a> "Dost thou not know, that the greatest part of Asia is subject to our arms and our laws?  that our invincible forces extend from one sea to the other?  that the potentates of the earth form a line before our gate?  and that we have compelled Fortune herself to watch over the prosperity of our empire.  What is the foundation of thy insolence and folly?  Thou hast fought some battles in the woods of Anatolia; contemptible trophies!  Thou hast obtained some victories over the Christians of Europe; thy sword was blessed by the apostle of God; and thy obedience to the precept of the Koran, in waging war against the infidels, is the sole consideration that prevents us from destroying thy country, the frontier and bulwark of the Moslem world.  Be wise in time; reflect; repent; and avert the thunder of our vengeance, which is yet suspended over thy head. Thou art no more than a pismire; why wilt thou seek to provoke the elephants? Alas!  they will trample thee under their feet." In his replies, Bajazet poured forth the indignation of a soul which was deeply stung by such unusual contempt.  After retorting the basest reproaches on the thief and rebel of the desert, the Ottoman recapitulates his boasted victories in Iran, Touran, and the Indies; and labors to prove, that Timour had never triumphed unless by his own perfidy and the vices of his foes.  "Thy armies are innumerable: be they so; but what are the arrows of the flying Tartar against the cimeters and battle-axes of my firm and invincible Janizaries?  I will guard the princes who have implored my protection: seek them in my tents.  The cities of Arzingan and Erzeroum are mine; and unless the tribute be duly paid, I will demand the arrears under the walls of Tauris and Sultania." The ungovernable rage of the sultan at length betrayed him to an insult of a more domestic kind.  "If I fly from thy arms," said he, "may my wives be thrice divorced from my bed: but if thou hast not courage to meet me in the field, mayest thou again receive thy wives after they have thrice endured the embraces of a stranger."  <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">30</font></a> Any violation by word or deed of the secrecy of the harem is an unpardonable offence among the Turkish nations;  <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">31</font></a> and the political quarrel of the two monarchs was imbittered by private and personal resentment.  Yet in his first expedition, Timour was satisfied with the siege and destruction of Siwas or Sebaste, a strong city on the borders of Anatolia; and he revenged the indiscretion of the Ottoman, on a garrison of four thousand Armenians, who were buried alive for the brave and faithful discharge of their duty.  <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">!_0044</font></a> As a Mussulman, he seemed to respect the pious occupation of Bajazet, who was still engaged in the blockade of Constantinople; and after this salutary lesson, the Mogul conqueror checked his pursuit, and turned aside to the invasion of Syria and Egypt.  In these transactions, the Ottoman prince, by the Orientals, and even by Timour, is styled the Kaissar of Roum, the Caesar of the Romans; a title which, by a small anticipation, might be given to a monarch who possessed the provinces, and threatened the city, of the successors of Constantine.  <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">32</font></a>

Petit de la Croix, (Paris, 1722, in 4 vols. 12 mo.,) and has always been my faithful guide.  His geography and chronology are wonderfully accurate; and he may be trusted for public facts, though he servilely praises the virtue and fortune of the hero.

 <p>     Note: The manuscript of Major Davy has been translated by Major Stewart, and published by the Oriental Translation Committee of London.  It contains the life of Timour, from his birth to his forty-first year; but the last thirty years of western war and conquest are wanting.  Major Stewart intimates that two manuscripts exist in this country containing the whole work, but excuses himself, on account of his age, from undertaking the laborious task of completing the translation.  It is to be hoped that the European public will be soon enabled to judge of the value and authenticity of the Commentaries of the Caesar of the East.  Major Stewart's work commences with the Book of Dreams and Omens - a wild, but characteristic, chronicle of Visions and Sortes Koranicae.  Strange that a life of Timour should awaken a reminiscence of the diary of Archbishop Laud!  The early dawn and the gradual expression of his not less splendid but more real visions of ambition are touched with the simplicity of truth and nature.  But we long to escape from the petty feuds of the pastoral chieftain, to the triumphs and the legislation of the conqueror of the world - M.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_553"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_553">5</a> The original of the tale is found in the following work, which is much esteemed for its florid elegance of style: Ahmedis Arabsiadae (Ahmed Ebn Arabshah) Vitae et Rerum gestarum Timuri.  Arabice et Latine.  Edidit Samuel Henricus Manger.  Franequerae, 1767, 2 tom. in 4to.  This Syrian author is ever a malicious, and often an ignorant enemy: the very titles of his chapters are injurious; as how the wicked, as how the impious, as how the viper, &amp;c. The copious article of Timur, in Bibliotheque Orientale, is of a mixed nature, as D'Herbelot indifferently draws his materials (p. 877 - 888) from Khondemir Ebn Schounah, and the Lebtarikh.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_554"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_554">6</a> Demir or Timour signifies in the Turkish language, Iron; and it is the appellation of a lord or prince.  By the change of a letter or accent, it is changed into Lenc, or Lame; and a European corruption confounds the two words in the name of Tamerlane. </p> 
 <p>     Note: According to the memoirs he was so called by a Shaikh, who, when visited by his mother on his birth, was reading the verse of the Koran, 'Are you sure that he who dwelleth in heaven will not cause the earth to swallow you up, and behold it shall shake, Tamurn." The Shaikh then stopped and said, "We have named your son Timur," p. 21. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_555"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_555">*_0041</a> He was lamed by a wound at the siege of the capital of Sistan. Sherefeddin, lib. iii. c. 17. p. 136.  See Von Hammer, vol. i. p. 260. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_556"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_556">!_0042</a> In the memoirs, the title Gurgan is in one place (p. 23) interpreted the son-in-law; in another (p. 28) as Kurkan, great prince, generalissimo, and prime minister of Jagtai. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_557"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_557">7</a> After relating some false and foolish tales of Timour Lenc, Arabshah is compelled to speak truth, and to own him for a kinsman of Zingis, per mulieres, (as he peevishly adds,) laqueos Satanae, (pars i. c. i. p. 25.) The testimony of Abulghazi Khan (P. ii. c. 5, P. v. c. 4) is clear, unquestionable, and decisive.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_558"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_558">8</a> According to one of the pedigrees, the fourth ancestor of Zingis, and the ninth of timour, were brothers; and they agreed, that the posterity of the elder should succeed to the dignity of khan, and that the descendants of the younger should fill the office of their minister and general.  This tradition was at least convenient to justify the first steps of Timour's ambition, (Institutions, p. 24, 25, from the MS. fragments of Timour's History.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_559"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_559">9</a> See the preface of Sherefeddin, and Abulfeda's Geography, (Chorasmiae, &amp;c., Descriptio, p. 60, 61,) in the iiid volume of Hudson's Minor Greek Geographers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_560"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_560">10</a> See his nativity in Dr. Hyde, (Syntagma Dissertat. tom. ii. p. 466,) as it was cast by the astrologers of his grandson Ulugh Beg.  He was born, A.D. 1336, April 9, 11 degrees 57 minutes. P. M., lat. 36.  I know not whether they can prove the great conjunction of the planets from whence, like other conquerors and prophets, Timour derived the surname of Saheb Keran, or master of the conjunctions, (Bibliot. Orient. p. 878.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_561"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_561">11</a> In the Institutions of Timour, these subjects of the khan of Kashgar are most improperly styled Ouzbegs, or Usbeks, a name which belongs to another branch and country of Tartars, (Abulghazi, P. v. c. v. P. vii. c. 5.) Could I be sure that this word is in the Turkish original, I would boldly pronounce, that the Institutions were framed a century after the death of Timour, since the establishment of the Usbeks in Transoxiana.       Note: Col. Stewart observes, that the Persian translator has sometimes made use of the name Uzbek by anticipation.  He observes, likewise, that these Jits (Getes) are not to be confounded with the ancient Getae: they were unconverted Turks.  Col. Tod (History of Rajasthan, vol. i. p. 166) would identify the Jits with the ancient race. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_562"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_562">!!_0042</a> He was twenty-seven before he served his first wars under the emir Houssein, who ruled over Khorasan and Mawerainnehr.  Von Hammer, vol. i. p. 262.  Neither of these statements agrees with the Memoirs.  At twelve he was a boy.  "I fancied that I perceived in myself all the signs of greatness and wisdom, and whoever came to visit me, I received with great hauteur and dignity." At seventeen he undertook the management of the flocks and herds of the family, (p. 24.) At nineteen he became religious, and "left off playing chess," made a kind of Budhist vow never to injure living thing and felt his foot paralyzed from having accidentally trod upon an ant, (p. 30.) At twenty, thoughts of rebellion and greatness rose in his mind; at twenty-one, he seems to have performed his first feat of arms.  He was a practised warrior when he served, in his twenty-seventh year, under Emir Houssein.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_563"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_563">!!!_0042</a> Compare Memoirs, page 61.  The imprisonment is there stated at fifty-three days.  "At this time I made a vow to God that I would never keep any person, whether guilty or innocent, for any length of time, in prison or in chains." p. 63. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_564"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_564">*_0042</a> Timour, on one occasion, sent him this message: "He who wishes to embrace the bride of royalty must kiss her across the edge of the sharp sword," p. 83.  The scene of the trial of Houssein, the resistance of Timour gradually becoming more feeble, the vengeance of the chiefs becoming proportionably more determined, is strikingly portrayed.  Mem. p 130 - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_565"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_565">12</a> The ist book of Sherefeddin is employed on the private life of the hero: and he himself, or his secretary, (Institutions, p. 3 - 77,) enlarges with pleasure on the thirteen designs and enterprises which most truly constitute his personal merit.  It even shines through the dark coloring of Arabshah, (P. i. c. 1 - 12.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_566"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_566">13</a> The conquests of Persia, Tartary, and India, are represented in the iid and iiid books of Sherefeddin, and by Arabshah, (c. 13 - 55.) Consult the excellent Indexes to the Institutions. </p> 
 <p>     Note: Compare the seventh book of Von Hammer, Geschichte des Osman ischen Reiches. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_567"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_567">14</a> The reverence of the Tartars for the mysterious number of nine is declared by Abulghazi Khan, who, for that reason, divides his Genealogical History into nine parts.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_568"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_568">15</a> According to Arabshah, (P. i. c. 28, p. 183,) the coward Timour ran away to his tent, and hid himself from the pursuit of Shah Mansour under the women's garments.  Perhaps Sherefeddin (l. iii. c. 25) has magnified his courage.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_569"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_569">16</a> The history of Ormuz is not unlike that of Tyre.  The old city, on the continent, was destroyed by the Tartars, and renewed in a neighboring island, without fresh water or vegetation.  The kings of Ormuz, rich in the Indian trade and the pearl fishery, possessed large territories both in Persia and Arabia; but they were at first the tributaries of the sultans of Kerman, and at last were delivered (A.D. 1505) by the Portuguese tyrants from the tyranny of their own viziers, (Marco Polo, l. i. c. 15, 16, fol. 7, 8. Abulfeda, Geograph. tabul. xi. p. 261, 262, an original Chronicle of Ormuz, in Texeira, or Stevens's History of Persia, p. 376 - 416, and the Itineraries inserted in the ist volume of Ramusio, of Ludovico Barthema, (1503,) fol. 167, of Andrea Corsali, (1517) fol. 202, 203, and of Odoardo Barbessa, (in 1516,) fol 313 - 318.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_570"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_570">17</a> Arabshah had travelled into Kipzak, and acquired a singular knowledge of the geography, cities, and revolutions, of that northern region, (P. i. c. 45 - 49.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_571"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_571">18</a> Institutions of Timour, p. 123, 125.  Mr. White, the editor, bestows some animadversion on the superficial account of Sherefeddin, (l. iii. c. 12, 13, 14,) who was ignorant of the designs of Timour, and the true springs of action.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_572"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_572">19</a> The furs of Russia are more credible than the ingots.  But the linen of Antioch has never been famous: and Antioch was in ruins.  I suspect that it was some manufacture of Europe, which the Hanse merchants had imported by the way of Novogorod.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_573"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_573">20</a> M. Levesque (Hist. de Russie, tom. ii. p. 247.  Vie de Timour, p. 64 - 67, before the French version of the Institutes) has corrected the error of Sherefeddin, and marked the true limit of Timour's conquests.  His arguments are superfluous; and a simple appeal to the Russian annals is sufficient to prove that Moscow, which six years before had been taken by Toctamish, escaped the arms of a more formidable invader.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_574"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_574">21</a> An Egyptian consul from Grand Cairo is mentioned in Barbaro's voyage to Tana in 1436, after the city had been rebuilt, (Ramusio, tom. ii. fol. 92.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_575"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_575">22</a> The sack of Azoph is described by Sherefeddin, (l. iii. c. 55,) and much more particularly by the author of an Italian chronicle, (Andreas de Redusiis de Quero, in Chron. Tarvisiano, in Muratori, Script. Rerum Italicarum, tom. xix. p. 802 - 805.) He had conversed with the Mianis, two Venetian brothers, one of whom had been sent a deputy to the camp of Timour, and the other had lost at Azoph three sons and 12,000 ducats.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_576"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_576">23</a> Sherefeddin only says (l. iii. c. 13) that the rays of the setting, and those of the rising sun, were scarcely separated by any interval; a problem which may be solved in the latitude of Moscow, (the 56th degree,) with the aid of the Aurora Borealis, and a long summer twilight. But a day of forty days (Khondemir apud D'Herbelot, p. 880) would rigorously confine us within the polar circle.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_578"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_578">*_0043</a> Gibbon (observes M. von Hammer) is mistaken in the correspondence of the ninety-two squadrons of his army with the ninety-two names of God: the names of God are ninety-nine. and Allah is the hundredth, p. 286, note.  But Gibbon speaks of the names or epithets of Mahomet, not of God. - M</p>
 <p><a name="fn_579"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_579">25</a> The rivers of the Punjab, the five eastern branches of the Indus, have been laid down for the first time with truth and accuracy in Major Rennel's incomparable map of Hindostan.

"A most wonderful scene.  The B'hagiratha or Ganges issues from under a very low arch at the foot of the grand snow bed.  My guide, an illiterate mountaineer compared the pendent icicles to Mahodeva's hair." (Compare Poems, Quarterly Rev. vol. xiv. p. 37, and at the end of my translation of Nala.)

 <p><a name="fn_583"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_583">26</a> The two great rivers, the Ganges and Burrampooter, rise in Thibet, from the opposite ridges of the same hills, separate from each other to the distance of 1200 miles, and, after a winding course of 2000 miles, again meet in one point near the Gulf of Bengal.  Yet so capricious is Fame, that the Burrampooter is a late discovery, while his brother Ganges has been the theme of ancient and modern story Coupele, the scene of Timour's last victory, must be situate near Loldong, 1100 miles from Calcutta; and in 1774, a British camp!

It is probable, that they have been translated, with various latitude, from the Turkish original into the Arabic and Persian tongues. </p> 
 <p>     Note: Von Hammer considers the letter which Gibbon inserted in the text to be spurious.  On the various copies of these letters, see his note, p 11 - 16. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_586"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_586">29</a> The Mogul emir distinguishes himself and his countrymen by the name of Turks, and stigmatizes the race and nation of Bajazet with the less honorable epithet of Turkmans.  Yet I do not understand how the Ottomans could be descended from a Turkman sailor; those inland shepherds were so remote from the sea, and all maritime affairs. </p>

 <p><a name="fn_587"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_587">30</a> According to the Koran, (c. ii. p. 27, and Sale's Discourses, p. 134,) Mussulman who had thrice divorced his wife, (who had thrice repeated the words of a divorce,) could not take her again, till after she had been married to, and repudiated by, another husband; an ignominious transaction, which it is needless to aggravate, by supposing that the first husband must see her enjoyed by a second before his face, (Rycaut's State of the Ottoman Empire, l. ii. c. 21.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_588"></a><a href="daf06020.htm#fr_588">31</a> The common delicacy of the Orientals, in never speaking of their women, is ascribed in a much higher degree by Arabshah to the Turkish nations; and it is remarkable enough, that Chalcondyles (l. ii. p. 55) had some knowledge of the prejudice and the insult. </p>
