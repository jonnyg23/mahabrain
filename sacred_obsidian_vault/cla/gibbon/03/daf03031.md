 <p>     Invasion Of Gaul By Attila. - He Is Repulsed By Aetius And The Visigoths. - Attila Invades And Evacuates Italy. - The Deaths Of Attila, Aetius, And Valentinian The Third. </p> 
 <p>     It was the opinion of Marcian, that war should be avoided, as long as it is possible to preserve a secure and honorable peace; but it was likewise his opinion, that peace cannot be honorable or secure, if the sovereign betrays a pusillanimous aversion to war.  This temperate courage dictated his reply to the demands of Attila, who insolently pressed the payment of the annual tribute.  The emperor signified to the Barbarians, that they must no longer insult the majesty of Rome by the mention of a tribute; that he was disposed to reward, with becoming liberality, the faithful friendship of his allies; but that, if they presumed to violate the public peace, they should feel that he possessed troops, and arms, and resolution, to repel their attacks.  The same language, even in the camp of the Huns, was used by his ambassador Apollonius, whose bold refusal to deliver the presents, till he had been admitted to a personal interview, displayed a sense of dignity, and a contempt of danger, which Attila was not prepared to expect from the degenerate Romans.  <a name="fr_803"></a><a href="#fn_803"><font size="1">1</font></a> He threatened to chastise the rash successor of Theodosius; but he hesitated whether he should first direct his invincible arms against the Eastern or the Western empire.  While mankind awaited his decision with awful suspense, he sent an equal defiance to the courts of Ravenna and Constantinople; and his ministers saluted the two emperors with the same haughty declaration. "Attila, my lord, and thy lord, commands thee to provide a palace for his immediate reception."  <a name="fr_804"></a><a href="#fn_804"><font size="1">2</font></a> But as the Barbarian despised, or affected to despise, the Romans of the East, whom he had so often vanquished, he soon declared his resolution of suspending the easy conquest, till he had achieved a more glorious and important enterprise.  In the memorable invasions of Gaul and Italy, the Huns were naturally attracted by the wealth and fertility of those provinces; but the particular motives and provocations of Attila can only be explained by the state of the Western empire under the reign of Valentinian, or, to speak more correctly, under the administration of Aetius.  <a name="fr_805"></a><a href="#fn_805"><font size="1">3</font></a> </p>

 <p>     After the death of his rival Boniface, Aetius had prudently retired to the tents of the Huns; and he was indebted to their alliance for his safety and his restoration.  Instead of the suppliant language of a guilty exile, he solicited his pardon at the head of sixty thousand Barbarians; and the empress Placidia confessed, by a feeble resistance, that the condescension, which might have been ascribed to clemency, was the effect of weakness or fear.  She delivered herself, her son Valentinian, and the Western empire, into the hands of an insolent subject; nor could Placidia protect the son- in-law of Boniface, the virtuous and faithful Sebastian,  <a name="fr_806"></a><a href="#fn_806"><font size="1">4</font></a> from the implacable persecution which urged him from one kingdom to another, till he miserably perished in the service of the Vandals.  The fortunate Aetius, who was immediately promoted to the rank of patrician, and thrice invested with the honors of the consulship, assumed, with the title of master of the cavalry and infantry, the whole military power of the state; and he is sometimes styled, by contemporary writers, the duke, or general, of the Romans of the West.  His prudence, rather than his virtue, engaged him to leave the grandson of Theodosius in the possession of the purple; and Valentinian was permitted to enjoy the peace and luxury of Italy, while the patrician appeared in the glorious light of a hero and a patriot, who supported near twenty years the ruins of the Western empire.  The Gothic historian ingenuously confesses, that Aetius was born for the salvation of the Roman republic;  <a name="fr_807"></a><a href="#fn_807"><font size="1">5</font></a> and the following portrait, though it is drawn in the fairest colors, must be allowed to contain a much larger proportion of truth than of flattery.  <a name="fr_808"></a><a href="#fn_808"><font size="1">*_0024</font></a> "His mother was a wealthy and noble Italian, and his father Gaudentius, who held a distinguished rank in the province of Scythia, gradually rose from the station of a military domestic, to the dignity of master of the cavalry.  Their son, who was enrolled almost in his infancy in the guards, was given as a hostage, first to Alaric, and afterwards to the Huns;  <a name="fr_809"></a><a href="#fn_809"><font size="1">!_0024</font></a> and he successively obtained the civil and military honors of the palace, for which he was equally qualified by superior merit.  The graceful figure of Aetius was not above the middle stature; but his manly limbs were admirably formed for strength, beauty, and agility; and he excelled in the martial exercises of managing a horse, drawing the bow, and darting the javelin.  He could patiently endure the want of food, or of sleep; and his mind and body were alike capable of the most laborious efforts.  He possessed the genuine courage that can despise not only dangers, but injuries: and it was impossible either to corrupt, or deceive, or intimidate the firm integrity of his soul."  <a name="fr_810"></a><a href="#fn_810"><font size="1">6</font></a> The Barbarians, who had seated themselves in the Western provinces, were insensibly taught to respect the faith and valor of the patrician Aetius.  He soothed their passions, consulted their prejudices, balanced their interests, and checked their ambition.  <a name="fr_811"></a><a href="#fn_811"><font size="1">**_0024</font></a> A seasonable treaty, which he concluded with Genseric, protected Italy from the depredations of the Vandals; the independent Britons implored and acknowledged his salutary aid; the Imperial authority was restored and maintained in Gaul and Spain; and he compelled the Franks and the Suevi, whom he had vanquished in the field, to become the useful confederates of the republic.

 <p>     From a principle of interest, as well as gratitude, Aetius assiduously cultivated the alliance of the Huns.  While he resided in their tents as a hostage, or an exile, he had familiarly conversed with Attila himself, the nephew of his benefactor; and the two famous antagonists appeared to have been connected by a personal and military friendship, which they afterwards confirmed by mutual gifts, frequent embassies, and the education of Carpilio, the son of Aetius, in the camp of Attila.  By the specious professions of gratitude and voluntary attachment, the patrician might disguise his apprehensions of the Scythian conqueror, who pressed the two empires with his innumerable armies.  His demands were obeyed or eluded. When he claimed the spoils of a vanquished city, some vases of gold, which had been fraudulently embezzled, the civil and military governors of Noricum were immediately despatched to satisfy his complaints:  <a name="fr_812"></a><a href="#fn_812"><font size="1">7</font></a> and it is evident, from their conversation with Maximin and Priscus, in the royal village, that the valor and prudence of Aetius had not saved the Western Romans from the common ignominy of tribute.  Yet his dexterous policy prolonged the advantages of a salutary peace; and a numerous army of Huns and Alani, whom he had attached to his person, was employed in the defence of Gaul.  Two colonies of these Barbarians were judiciously fixed in the territories of Valens and Orleans;  <a name="fr_813"></a><a href="#fn_813"><font size="1">8</font></a> and their active cavalry secured the important passages of the Rhone and of the Loire.  These savage allies were not indeed less formidable to the subjects than to the enemies of Rome. Their original settlement was enforced with the licentious violence of conquest; and the province through which they marched was exposed to all the calamities of a hostile invasion.  <a name="fr_814"></a><a href="#fn_814"><font size="1">9</font></a> Strangers to the emperor or the republic, the Alani of Gaul was devoted to the ambition of Aetius, and though he might suspect, that, in a contest with Attila himself, they would revolt to the standard of their national king, the patrician labored to restrain, rather than to excite, their zeal and resentment against the Goths, the Burgundians, and the Franks.  
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     The kingdom established by the Visigoths in the southern provinces of Gaul, had gradually acquired strength and maturity; and the conduct of those ambitious Barbarians, either in peace or war, engaged the perpetual vigilance of Aetius.  After the death of Wallia, the Gothic sceptre devolved to Theodoric, the son of the great Alaric;  <a name="fr_815"></a><a href="#fn_815"><font size="1">10</font></a> and his prosperous reign of more than thirty years, over a turbulent people, may be allowed to prove, that his prudence was supported by uncommon vigor, both of mind and body.  Impatient of his narrow limits, Theodoric aspired to the possession of Arles, the wealthy seat of government and commerce; but the city was saved by the timely approach of Aetius; and the Gothic king, who had raised the siege with some loss and disgrace, was persuaded, for an adequate subsidy, to divert the martial valor of his subjects in a Spanish war.  Yet Theodoric still watched, and eagerly seized, the favorable moment of renewing his hostile attempts.  The Goths besieged Narbonne, while the Belgic provinces were invaded by the Burgundians; and the public safety was threatened on every side by the apparent union of the enemies of Rome.  On every side, the activity of Aetius, and his Scythian cavalry, opposed a firm and successful resistance.  Twenty thousand Burgundians were slain in battle; and the remains of the nation humbly accepted a dependent seat in the mountains of Savoy.  <a name="fr_816"></a><a href="#fn_816"><font size="1">11</font></a> The walls of Narbonne had been shaken by the battering engines, and the inhabitants had endured the last extremities of famine, when Count Litorius, approaching in silence, and directing each horseman to carry behind him two sacks of flour, cut his way through the intrenchments of the besiegers.  The siege was immediately raised; and the more decisive victory, which is ascribed to the personal conduct of Aetius himself, was marked with the blood of eight thousand Goths.  But in the absence of the patrician, who was hastily summoned to Italy by some public or private interest, Count Litorius succeeded to the command; and his presumption soon discovered that far different talents are required to lead a wing of cavalry, or to direct the operations of an important war.  At the head of an army of Huns, he rashly advanced to the gates of Thoulouse, full of careless contempt for an enemy whom his misfortunes had rendered prudent, and his situation made desperate.  The predictions of the augurs had inspired Litorius with the profane confidence that he should enter the Gothic capital in triumph; and the trust which he reposed in his Pagan allies, encouraged him to reject the fair conditions of peace, which were repeatedly proposed by the bishops in the name of Theodoric.  The king of the Goths exhibited in his distress the edifying contrast of Christian piety and moderation; nor did he lay aside his sackcloth and ashes till he was prepared to arm for the combat. His soldiers, animated with martial and religious enthusiasm, assaulted the camp of Litorius.  The conflict was obstinate; the slaughter was mutual.  The Roman general, after a total defeat, which could be imputed only to his unskilful rashness, was actually led through the streets of Thoulouse, not in his own, but in a hostile triumph; and the misery which he experienced, in a long and ignominious captivity, excited the compassion of the Barbarians themselves.  <a name="fr_817"></a><a href="#fn_817"><font size="1">12</font></a> Such a loss, in a country whose spirit and finances were long since exhausted, could not easily be repaired; and the Goths, assuming, in their turn, the sentiments of ambition and revenge, would have planted their victorious standards on the banks of the Rhone, if the presence of Aetius had not restored strength and discipline to the Romans.  <a name="fr_818"></a><a href="#fn_818"><font size="1">13</font></a> The two armies expected the signal of a decisive action; but the generals, who were conscious of each other's force, and doubtful of their own superiority, prudently sheathed their swords in the field of battle; and their reconciliation was permanent and sincere.  Theodoric, king of the Visigoths, appears to have deserved the love of his subjects, the confidence of his allies, and the esteem of mankind.  His throne was surrounded by six valiant sons, who were educated with equal care in the exercises of the Barbarian camp, and in those of the Gallic schools: from the study of the Roman jurisprudence, they acquired the theory, at least, of law and justice; and the harmonious sense of Virgil contributed to soften the asperity of their native manners.  <a name="fr_819"></a><a href="#fn_819"><font size="1">14</font></a> The two daughters of the Gothic king were given in marriage to the eldest sons of the kings of the Suevi and of the Vandals, who reigned in Spain and Africa: but these illustrious alliances were pregnant with guilt and discord.  The queen of the Suevi bewailed the death of a husband inhumanly massacred by her brother.  The princess of the Vandals was the victim of a jealous tyrant, whom she called her father.  The cruel Genseric suspected that his son's wife had conspired to poison him; the supposed crime was punished by the amputation of her nose and ears; and the unhappy daughter of Theodoric was ignominiously returned to the court of Thoulouse in that deformed and mutilated condition. This horrid act, which must seem incredible to a civilized age drew tears from every spectator; but Theodoric was urged, by the feelings of a parent and a king, to revenge such irreparable injuries.  The Imperial ministers, who always cherished the discord of the Barbarians, would have supplied the Goths with arms, and ships, and treasures, for the African war; and the cruelty of Genseric might have been fatal to himself, if the artful Vandal had not armed, in his cause, the formidable power of the Huns.  His rich gifts and pressing solicitations inflamed the ambition of Attila; and the designs of Aetius and Theodoric were prevented by the invasion of Gaul.  <a name="fr_820"></a><a href="#fn_820"><font size="1">15</font></a>

 <p>     The Franks, whose monarchy was still confined to the neighborhood of the Lower Rhine, had wisely established the right of hereditary succession in the noble family of the Merovingians.  <a name="fr_821"></a><a href="#fn_821"><font size="1">16</font></a> These princes were elevated on a buckler, the symbol of military command;  <a name="fr_822"></a><a href="#fn_822"><font size="1">17</font></a> and the royal fashion of long hair was the ensign of their birth and dignity.  Their flaxen locks, which they combed and dressed with singular care, hung down in flowing ringlets on their back and shoulders; while the rest of the nation were obliged, either by law or custom, to shave the hinder part of their head, to comb their hair over the forehead, and to content themselves with the ornament of two small whiskers.  <a name="fr_823"></a><a href="#fn_823"><font size="1">18</font></a> The lofty stature of the Franks, and their blue eyes, denoted a Germanic origin; their close apparel accurately expressed the figure of their limbs; a weighty sword was suspended from a broad belt; their bodies were protected by a large shield; and these warlike Barbarians were trained, from their earliest youth, to run, to leap, to swim; to dart the javelin, or battle-axe, with unerring aim; to advance, without hesitation, against a superior enemy; and to maintain, either in life or death, the invincible reputation of their ancestors.  <a name="fr_824"></a><a href="#fn_824"><font size="1">19</font></a> Clodion, the first of their long-haired kings, whose name and actions are mentioned in authentic history, held his residence at Dispargum,  <a name="fr_825"></a><a href="#fn_825"><font size="1">20</font></a> a village or fortress, whose place may be assigned between Louvain and Brussels.  From the report of his spies, the king of the Franks was informed, that the defenceless state of the second Belgic must yield, on the slightest attack, to the valor of his subjects.  He boldly penetrated through the thickets and morasses of the Carbonarian forest;  <a name="fr_826"></a><a href="#fn_826"><font size="1">21</font></a> occupied Tournay and Cambray, the only cities which existed in the fifth century, and extended his conquests as far as the River Somme, over a desolate country, whose cultivation and populousness are the effects of more recent industry.  <a name="fr_827"></a><a href="#fn_827"><font size="1">22</font></a> While Clodion lay encamped in the plains of Artois,  <a name="fr_828"></a><a href="#fn_828"><font size="1">23</font></a> and celebrated, with vain and ostentatious security, the marriage, perhaps, of his son, the nuptial feast was interrupted by the unexpected and unwelcome presence of Aetius, who had passed the Somme at the head of his light cavalry. The tables, which had been spread under the shelter of a hill, along the banks of a pleasant stream, were rudely overturned; the Franks were oppressed before they could recover their arms, or their ranks; and their unavailing valor was fatal only to themselves.  The loaded wagons, which had followed their march, afforded a rich booty; and the virgin- bride, with her female attendants, submitted to the new lovers, who were imposed on them by the chance of war. This advance, which had been obtained by the skill and activity of Aetius, might reflect some disgrace on the military prudence of Clodion; but the king of the Franks soon regained his strength and reputation, and still maintained the possession of his Gallic kingdom from the Rhine to the Somme.  <a name="fr_829"></a><a href="#fn_829"><font size="1">24</font></a> Under his reign, and most probably from the thee enterprising spirit of his subjects, his three capitals, Mentz, Treves, and Cologne, experienced the effects of hostile cruelty and avarice.  The distress of Cologne was prolonged by the perpetual dominion of the same Barbarians, who evacuated the ruins of Treves; and Treves, which in the space of forty years had been four times besieged and pillaged, was disposed to lose the memory of her afflictions in the vain amusements of the Circus.  <a name="fr_830"></a><a href="#fn_830"><font size="1">25</font></a> The death of Clodion, after a reign of twenty years, exposed his kingdom to the discord and ambition of his two sons. Meroveus, the younger,  <a name="fr_831"></a><a href="#fn_831"><font size="1">26</font></a> was persuaded to implore the protection of Rome; he was received at the Imperial court, as the ally of Valentinian, and the adopted son of the patrician Aetius; and dismissed to his native country, with splendid gifts, and the strongest assurances of friendship and support. During his absence, his elder brother had solicited, with equal ardor, the formidable aid of Attila; and the king of the Huns embraced an alliance, which facilitated the passage of the Rhine, and justified, by a specious and honorable pretence, the invasion of Gaul.  <a name="fr_832"></a><a href="#fn_832"><font size="1">27</font></a> </p>

 <p><a name="fn_818"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_818">13</a> -     Capto terrarum damna patebant                     Litorio, in Rhodanum proprios producere fines,                     Thendoridae fixum; nec erat pugnare necesse,                     Sed migrare Getis; rabidam trux asperat iram                     Victor; quod sensit Scythicum sub moenibus hostem                     Imputat, et nihil est gravius, si forsitan unquam                     Vincere contingat, trepido.  Panegyr. Avit. 300, &amp;c.  Sitionius then proceeds, according to the duty of a panegyrist, to transfer the whole merit from Aetius to his minister Avitus.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_819"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_819">14</a> Theodoric II. revered, in the person of Avitus, the character of his preceptor. </p> 
 <p>      - Mihi Romula dudum      Per te jura placent; parvumque ediscere jussit      Ad tua verba pater, docili quo prisca Maronis      Carmine molliret Scythicos mihi pagina mores. </p>

 <p><a name="fn_820"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_820">15</a> Our authorities for the reign of Theodoric I. are, Jornandes de Rebus Geticis, c. 34, 36, and the Chronicles of Idatius, and the two Prospers, inserted in the historians of France, tom. i. p. 612 - 640.  To these we may add Salvian de Gubernatione Dei, l. vii. p. 243, 244, 245, and the panegyric of Avitus, by Sidonius.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_821"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_821">16</a> Reges Crinitos se creavisse de prima, et ut ita dicam nobiliori suorum familia, (Greg. Turon. l. ii. c. 9, p. 166, of the second volume of the Historians of France.) Gregory himself does not mention the Merovingian name, which may be traced, however, to the beginning of the seventh century, as the distinctive appellation of the royal family, and even of the French monarchy. An ingenious critic has deduced the Merovingians from the great Maroboduus; and he has clearly proved, that the prince, who gave his name to the first race, was more ancient than the father of Childeric.  See Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 52 - 90, tom. xxx. p. 557 - 587.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_822"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_822">17</a> This German custom, which may be traced from Tacitus to Gregory of Tours, was at length adopted by the emperors of Constantinople. From a MS. of the tenth century, Montfaucon has delineated the representation of a similar ceremony, which the ignorance of the age had applied to King David.

See the Preface to the third volume of the Historians of France, and the Abbe Le Boeuf, (Dissertat. tom. iii. p. 47 - 79.) This peculiar fashion of the Merovingians has been remarked by natives and strangers; by Priscus, (tom. i. p. 608,) by Agathias, (tom. ii. p. 49,) and by Gregory of Tours, (l. viii. 18, vi. 24, viii. 10, tom. ii. p. 196, 278, 316.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_824"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_824">19</a> See an original picture of the figure, dress, arms, and temper of the ancient Franks, in Sidonius Apollinaris, (Panegyr. Majorian. 238 - 254;) and such pictures, though coarsely drawn, have a real and intrinsic value.  Father Daniel (History de la Milice Francoise, tom. i. p. 2 - 7) has illustrated the description.</p>

The French critics, impatient to establish their monarchy in Gaul, have drawn a strong argument from the silence of Sidonius, who dares not insinuate, that the vanquished Franks were compelled to repass the Rhine.

 <p><a name="fn_830"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_830">25</a> Salvian (de Gubernat. Dei, l. vi.) has expressed, in vague and declamatory language, the misfortunes of these three cities, which are distinctly ascertained by the learned Mascou, Hist. of the Ancient Germans, ix. 21.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_831"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_831">26</a> Priscus, in relating the contest, does not name the two brothers; the second of whom he had seen at Rome, a beardless youth, with long, flowing hair, (Historians of France, tom. i. p. 607, 608.) The Benedictine Editors are inclined to believe, that they were the sons of some unknown king of the Franks, who reigned on the banks of the Neckar; but the arguments of M. de Foncemagne (Mem. de l'Academie, tom. viii. p. 464) seem to prove that the succession of Clodion was disputed by his two sons, and that the younger was Meroveus, the father of Childeric. </p> 
 <p>     Note: The relationship of Meroveus to Clodion is extremely doubtful. - By some he is called an illegitimate son; by others merely of his race.  Tur ii. c. 9, in Sismondi, Hist. des Francais, i. 177. See Mezeray.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_832"></a><a href="daf03031.htm#fr_832">27</a> Under the Merovingian race, the throne was hereditary; but all the sons of the deceased monarch were equally entitled to their share of his treasures and territories.  See the Dissertations of M. de Foncemagne, in the sixth and eighth volumes of the Memoires de l'Academie.</p>
