 <p>     Reign And Conversion Of Clovis. - His Victories Over The Alemanni, Burgundians, And Visigoths. - Establishment Of The French Monarchy In Gaul. - Laws Of The Barbarians. - State Of The Romans. - The Visigoths Of Spain. - Conquest Of Britain By The Saxons. </p> 
 <p>     The Gauls,  <a name="fr_1203"></a><a href="#fn_1203"><font size="1">1</font></a> who impatiently supported the Roman yoke, received a memorable lesson from one of the lieutenants of Vespasian, whose weighty sense has been refined and expressed by the genius of Tacitus.  <a name="fr_1204"></a><a href="#fn_1204"><font size="1">2</font></a> "The protection of the republic has delivered Gaul from internal discord and foreign invasions. By the loss of national independence, you have acquired the name and privileges of Roman citizens.  You enjoy, in common with yourselves, the permanent benefits of civil government; and your remote situation is less exposed to the accidental mischiefs of tyranny.  Instead of exercising the rights of conquest, we have been contented to impose such tributes as are requisite for your own preservation.  Peace cannot be secured without armies; and armies must be supported at the expense of the people.  It is for your sake, not for our own, that we guard the barrier of the Rhine against the ferocious Germans, who have so often attempted, and who will always desire, to exchange the solitude of their woods and morasses for the wealth and fertility of Gaul.  The fall of Rome would be fatal to the provinces; and you would be buried in the ruins of that mighty fabric, which has been raised by the valor and wisdom of eight hundred years.  Your imaginary freedom would be insulted and oppressed by a savage master; and the expulsion of the Romans would be succeeded by the eternal hostilities of the Barbarian conquerors."  <a name="fr_1205"></a><a href="#fn_1205"><font size="1">3</font></a> This salutary advice was accepted, and this strange prediction was accomplished. In the space of four hundred years, the hardy Gauls, who had encountered the arms of Caesar, were imperceptibly melted into the general mass of citizens and subjects: the Western empire was dissolved; and the Germans, who had passed the Rhine, fiercely contended for the possession of Gaul, and excited the contempt, or abhorrence, of its peaceful and polished inhabitants.  With that conscious pride which the preeminence of knowledge and luxury seldom fails to inspire, they derided the hairy and gigantic savages of the North; their rustic manners, dissonant joy, voracious appetite, and their horrid appearance, equally disgusting to the sight and to the smell.  The liberal studies were still cultivated in the schools of Autun and Bordeaux; and the language of Cicero and Virgil was familiar to the Gallic youth.  Their ears were astonished by the harsh and unknown sounds of the Germanic dialect, and they ingeniously lamented that the trembling muses fled from the harmony of a Burgundian lyre.  The Gauls were endowed with all the advantages of art and nature; but as they wanted courage to defend them, they were justly condemned to obey, and even to flatter, the victorious Barbarians, by whose clemency they held their precarious fortunes and their lives.  <a name="fr_1206"></a><a href="#fn_1206"><font size="1">4</font></a> </p>

        As soon as Odoacer had extinguished the Western empire, he sought the friendship of the most powerful of the Barbarians.  The new sovereign of Italy resigned to Euric, king of the Visigoths, all the Roman conquests beyond the Alps, as far as the Rhine and the Ocean:  <a name="fr_1207"></a><a href="#fn_1207"><font size="1">5</font></a> and the senate might confirm this liberal gift with some ostentation of power, and without any real loss of revenue and dominion.  The lawful pretensions of Euric were justified by ambition and success; and the Gothic nation might aspire, under his command, to the monarchy of Spain and Gaul.  Arles and Marseilles surrendered to his arms: he oppressed the freedom of Auvergne; and the bishop condescended to purchase his recall from exile by a tribute of just, but reluctant praise. Sidonius waited before the gates of the palace among a crowd of ambassadors and suppliants; and their various business at the court of Bordeaux attested the power, and the renown, of the king of the Visigoths.  The Heruli of the distant ocean, who painted their naked bodies with its coerulean color, implored his protection; and the Saxons respected the maritime provinces of a prince, who was destitute of any naval force. The tall Burgundians submitted to his authority; nor did he restore the captive Franks, till he had imposed on that fierce nation the terms of an unequal peace.  The Vandals of Africa cultivated his useful friendship; and the Ostrogoths of Pannonia were supported by his powerful aid against the oppression of the neighboring Huns. The North (such are the lofty strains of the poet) was agitated or appeased by the nod of Euric; the great king of Persia consulted the oracle of the West; and the aged god of the Tyber was protected by the swelling genius of the Garonne.  <a name="fr_1208"></a><a href="#fn_1208"><font size="1">6</font></a> The fortune of nations has often depended on accidents; and France may ascribe her greatness to the premature death of the Gothic king, at a time when his son Alaric was a helpless infant, and his adversary Clovis  <a name="fr_1209"></a><a href="#fn_1209"><font size="1">7</font></a> an ambitious and valiant youth. </p> 
 <p>

        While Childeric, the father of Clovis, lived an exile in Germany, he was hospitably entertained by the queen, as well as by the king, of the Thuringians.  After his restoration, Basina escaped from her husband's bed to the arms of her lover; freely declaring, that if she had known a man wiser, stronger, or more beautiful, than Childeric, that man should have been the object of her preference.  <a name="fr_1210"></a><a href="#fn_1210"><font size="1">8</font></a> Clovis was the offspring of this voluntary union; and, when he was no more than fifteen years of age, he succeeded, by his father's death, to the command of the Salian tribe. <a name="fr_1211"></a><a href="#fn_1211"><font size="1">9</font></a>  The narrow limits of his kingdom were confined to the island of the Batavians, with the ancient dioceses of Tournay and Arras;  <a name="fr_1212"></a><a href="#fn_1212"><font size="1">10</font></a> and at the baptism of Clovis the number of his warriors could not exceed five thousand.  The kindred tribes of the Franks, who had seated themselves along the Belgic rivers, the Scheld, the Meuse, the Moselle, and the Rhine, were governed by their independent kings, of the Merovingian race; the equals, the allies, and sometimes the enemies of the Salic prince.  But the Germans, who obeyed, in peace, the hereditary jurisdiction of their chiefs, were free to follow the standard of a popular and victorious general; and the superior merit of Clovis attracted the respect and allegiance of the national confederacy.  When he first took the field, he had neither gold and silver in his coffers, nor wine and corn in his magazine;  <a name="fr_1213"></a><a href="#fn_1213"><font size="1">11</font></a> but he imitated the example of Caesar, who, in the same country, had acquired wealth by the sword, and purchased soldiers with the fruits of conquest.  After each successful battle or expedition, the spoils were accumulated in one common mass; every warrior received his proportionable share; and the royal prerogative submitted to the equal regulations of military law.  The untamed spirit of the Barbarians was taught to acknowledge the advantages of regular discipline.  <a name="fr_1214"></a><a href="#fn_1214"><font size="1">12</font></a> At the annual review of the month of March, their arms were diligently inspected; and when they traversed a peaceful territory, they were prohibited from touching a blade of grass.  The justice of Clovis was inexorable; and his careless or disobedient soldiers were punished with instant death.  It would be superfluous to praise the valor of a Frank; but the valor of Clovis was directed by cool and consummate prudence.  <a name="fr_1215"></a><a href="#fn_1215"><font size="1">13</font></a> In all his transactions with mankind, he calculated the weight of interest, of passion, and of opinion; and his measures were sometimes adapted to the sanguinary manners of the Germans, and sometimes moderated by the milder genius of Rome, and Christianity.  He was intercepted in the career of victory, since he died in the forty-fifth year of his age: but he had already accomplished, in a reign of thirty years, the establishment of the French monarchy in Gaul. </p>

        The first exploit of Clovis was the defeat of Syagrius, the son of Aegidius; and the public quarrel might, on this occasion, be inflamed by private resentment.  The glory of the father still insulted the Merovingian race; the power of the son might excite the jealous ambition of the king of the Franks.  Syagrius inherited, as a patrimonial estate, the city and diocese of Soissons: the desolate remnant of the second Belgic, Rheims and Troyes, Beauvais and Amiens, would naturally submit to the count or patrician:  <a name="fr_1216"></a><a href="#fn_1216"><font size="1">14</font></a> and after the dissolution of the Western empire, he might reign with the title, or at least with the authority, of king of the Romans.  <a name="fr_1217"></a><a href="#fn_1217"><font size="1">15</font></a> As a Roman, he had been educated in the liberal studies of rhetoric and jurisprudence; but he was engaged by accident and policy in the familiar use of the Germanic idiom.  The independent Barbarians resorted to the tribunal of a stranger, who possessed the singular talent of explaining, in their native tongue, the dictates of reason and equity. The diligence and affability of their judge rendered him popular, the impartial wisdom of his decrees obtained their voluntary obedience, and the reign of Syagrius over the Franks and Burgundians seemed to revive the original institution of civil society.  <a name="fr_1218"></a><a href="#fn_1218"><font size="1">16</font></a> In the midst of these peaceful occupations, Syagrius received, and boldly accepted, the hostile defiance of Clovis; who challenged his rival in the spirit, and almost in the language, of chivalry, to appoint the day and the field  <a name="fr_1219"></a><a href="#fn_1219"><font size="1">17</font></a> of battle.  In the time of Caesar Soissons would have poured forth a body of fifty thousand horse and such an army might have been plentifully supplied with shields, cuirasses, and military engines, from the three arsenals or manufactures of the city.  <a name="fr_1220"></a><a href="#fn_1220"><font size="1">18</font></a> But the courage and numbers of the Gallic youth were long since exhausted; and the loose bands of volunteers, or mercenaries, who marched under the standard of Syagrius, were incapable of contending with the national valor of the Franks.  It would be ungenerous without some more accurate knowledge of his strength and resources, to condemn the rapid flight of Syagrius, who escaped, after the loss of a battle, to the distant court of Thoulouse.  The feeble minority of Alaric could not assist or protect an unfortunate fugitive; the pusillanimous  <a name="fr_1221"></a><a href="#fn_1221"><font size="1">19</font></a> Goths were intimidated by the menaces of Clovis; and the Roman king, after a short confinement, was delivered into the hands of the executioner.  The Belgic cities surrendered to the king of the Franks; and his dominions were enlarged towards the East by the ample diocese of Tongres  <a name="fr_1222"></a><a href="#fn_1222"><font size="1">20</font></a> which Clovis subdued in the tenth year of his reign. </p>

 <p>     The name of the Alemanni has been absurdly derived from their imaginary settlement on the banks of the Leman Lake.  <a name="fr_1223"></a><a href="#fn_1223"><font size="1">21</font></a> That fortunate district, from the lake to the Avenche, and Mount Jura, was occupied by the Burgundians.  <a name="fr_1224"></a><a href="#fn_1224"><font size="1">22</font></a> The northern parts of Helvetia had indeed been subdued by the ferocious Alemanni, who destroyed with their own hands the fruits of their conquest.  A province, improved and adorned by the arts of Rome, was again reduced to a savage wilderness; and some vestige of the stately Vindonissa may still be discovered in the fertile and populous valley of the Aar.  <a name="fr_1225"></a><a href="#fn_1225"><font size="1">23</font></a> From the source of the Rhine to its conflux with the Mein and the Moselle, the formidable swarms of the Alemanni commanded either side of the river, by the right of ancient possession, or recent victory.  They had spread themselves into Gaul, over the modern provinces of Alsace and Lorraine; and their bold invasion of the kingdom of Cologne summoned the Salic prince to the defence of his Ripuarian allies.  Clovis encountered the invaders of Gaul in the plain of Tolbiac, about twenty-four miles from Cologne; and the two fiercest nations of Germany were mutually animated by the memory of past exploits, and the prospect of future greatness.  The Franks, after an obstinate struggle, gave way; and the Alemanni, raising a shout of victory, impetuously pressed their retreat.  But the battle was restored by the valor, and the conduct, and perhaps by the piety, of Clovis; and the event of the bloody day decided forever the alternative of empire or servitude.  The last king of the Alemanni was slain in the field, and his people were slaughtered or pursued, till they threw down their arms, and yielded to the mercy of the conqueror.  Without discipline it was impossible for them to rally: they had contemptuously demolished the walls and fortifications which might have protected their distress; and they were followed into the heart of their forests by an enemy not less active, or intrepid, than themselves.  The great Theodoric congratulated the victory of Clovis, whose sister Albofleda the king of Italy had lately married; but he mildly interceded with his brother in favor of the suppliants and fugitives, who had implored his protection.  The Gallic territories, which were possessed by the Alemanni, became the prize of their conqueror; and the haughty nation, invincible, or rebellious, to the arms of Rome, acknowledged the sovereignty of the Merovingian kings, who graciously permitted them to enjoy their peculiar manners and institutions, under the government of official, and, at length, of hereditary, dukes.  After the conquest of the Western provinces, the Franks alone maintained their ancient habitations beyond the Rhine.  They gradually subdued, and civilized, the exhausted countries, as far as the Elbe, and the mountains of Bohemia; and the peace of Europe was secured by the obedience of Germany.  <a name="fr_1226"></a><a href="#fn_1226"><font size="1">24</font></a>  
   
  </p> 
 <p>
   
        Till the thirtieth year of his age, Clovis continued to worship the gods of his ancestors.  <a name="fr_1227"></a><a href="#fn_1227"><font size="1">25</font></a> His disbelief, or rather disregard, of Christianity, might encourage him to pillage with less remorse the churches of a hostile territory: but his subjects of Gaul enjoyed the free exercise of religious worship; and the bishops entertained a more favorable hope of the idolater, than of the heretics.  The Merovingian prince had contracted a fortunate alliance with the fair Clotilda, the niece of the king of Burgundy, who, in the midst of an Arian court, was educated in the profession of the Catholic faith.  It was her interest, as well as her duty, to achieve the conversion  <a name="fr_1228"></a><a href="#fn_1228"><font size="1">26</font></a> of a Pagan husband; and Clovis insensibly listened to the voice of love and religion.  He conesnted (perhaps such terms had been previously stipulated) to the baptism of his eldest son; and though the sudden death of the infant excited some superstitious fears, he was persuaded, a second time, to repeat the dangerous experiment.  In the distress of the battle of Tolbiac, Clovis loudly invoked the God of Clotilda and the Christians; and victory disposed him to hear, with respectful gratitude, the eloquent  <a name="fr_1229"></a><a href="#fn_1229"><font size="1">27</font></a> Remigius,  <a name="fr_1230"></a><a href="#fn_1230"><font size="1">28</font></a> bishop of Rheims, who forcibly displayed the temporal and spiritual advantages of his conversion.  The king declared himself satisfied of the truth of the Catholic faith; and the political reasons which might have suspended his public profession, were removed by the devout or loyal acclamations of the Franks, who showed themselves alike prepared to follow their heroic leader to the field of battle, or to the baptismal font.  The important ceremony was performed in the cathedral of Rheims, with every circumstance of magnificence and solemnity that could impress an awful sense of religion on the minds of its rude proselytes.  <a name="fr_1231"></a><a href="#fn_1231"><font size="1">29</font></a> The new Constantine was immediately baptized, with three thousand of his warlike subjects; and their example was imitated by the remainder of the gentle Barbarians, who, in obedience to the victorious prelate, adored the cross which they had burnt, and burnt the idols which they had formerly adored.  <a name="fr_1232"></a><a href="#fn_1232"><font size="1">30</font></a> The mind of Clovis was susceptible of transient fervor: he was exasperated by the pathetic tale of the passion and death of Christ; and, instead of weighing the salutary consequences of that mysterious sacrifice, he exclaimed, with indiscreet fury, "Had I been present at the head of my valiant Franks, I would have revenged his injuries."  <a name="fr_1233"></a><a href="#fn_1233"><font size="1">31</font></a> But the savage conqueror of Gaul was incapable of examining the proofs of a religion, which depends on the laborious investigation of historic evidence and speculative theology.  He was still more incapable of feeling the mild influence of the gospel, which persuades and purifies the heart of a genuine convert.  His ambitious reign was a perpetual violation of moral and Christian duties: his hands were stained with blood in peace as well as in war; and, as soon as Clovis had dismissed a synod of the Gallican church, he calmly assassinated all the princes of the Merovingian race.  <a name="fr_1234"></a><a href="#fn_1234"><font size="1">32</font></a> Yet the king of the Franks might sincerely worship the Christian God, as a Being more excellent and powerful than his national deities; and the signal deliverance and victory of Tolbiac encouraged Clovis to confide in the future protection of the Lord of Hosts.  Martin, the most popular of the saints, had filled the Western world with the fame of those miracles which were incessantly performed at his holy sepulchre of Tours.  His visible or invisible aid promoted the cause of a liberal and orthodox prince; and the profane remark of Clovis himself, that St.Martin was an expensive friend,  <a name="fr_1235"></a><a href="#fn_1235"><font size="1">33</font></a> need not be interpreted as the symptom of any permanent or rational scepticism.  But earth, as well as heaven, rejoiced in the conversion of the Franks.  On the memorable day when Clovis ascended from the baptismal font, he alone, in the Christian world, deserved the name and prerogatives of a Catholic king.  The emperor Anastasius entertained some dangerous errors concerning the nature of the divine incarnation; and the Barbarians of Italy, Africa, Spain, and Gaul, were involved in the Arian heresy.  The eldest, or rather the only, son of the church, was acknowledged by the clergy as their lawful sovereign, or glorious deliverer; and the armies of Clovis were strenuously supported by the zeal and fervor of the Catholic faction.  <a name="fr_1236"></a><a href="#fn_1236"><font size="1">34</font></a>

        Under the Roman empire, the wealth and jurisdiction of the bishops, their sacred character, and perpetual office, their numerous dependants, popular eloquence, and provincial assemblies, had rendered them always respectable, and sometimes dangerous.  Their influence was augmented with the progress of superstition; and the establishment of the French monarchy may, in some degree, be ascribed to the firm alliance of a hundred prelates, who reigned in the discontented, or independent, cities of Gaul. The slight foundations of the Armorican republic had been repeatedly shaken, or overthrown; but the same people still guarded their domestic freedom; asserted the dignity of the Roman name; and bravely resisted the predatory inroads, and regular attacks, of Clovis, who labored to extend his conquests from the Seine to the Loire. Their successful opposition introduced an equal and honorable union.  The Franks esteemed the valor of the Armoricans  <a name="fr_1237"></a><a href="#fn_1237"><font size="1">35</font></a> and the Armoricans were reconciled by the religion of the Franks.  The military force which had been stationed for the defence of Gaul, consisted of one hundred different bands of cavalry or infantry; and these troops, while they assumed the title and privileges of Roman soldiers, were renewed by an incessant supply of the Barbarian youth.  The extreme fortifications, and scattered fragments of the empire, were still defended by their hopeless courage.  But their retreat was intercepted, and their communication was impracticable: they were abandoned by the Greek princes of Constantinople, and they piously disclaimed all connection with the Arian usurpers of Gaul.  They accepted, without shame or reluctance, the generous capitulation, which was proposed by a Catholic hero; and this spurious, or legitimate, progeny of the Roman legions, was distinguished in the succeeding age by their arms, their ensigns, and their peculiar dress and institutions.  But the national strength was increased by these powerful and voluntary accessions; and the neighboring kingdoms dreaded the numbers, as well as the spirit, of the Franks.  The reduction of the Northern provinces of Gaul, instead of being decided by the chance of a single battle, appears to have been slowly effected by the gradual operation of war and treaty and Clovis acquired each object of his ambition, by such efforts, or such concessions, as were adequate to its real value.  His savage character, and the virtues of Henry IV., suggest the most opposite ideas of human nature; yet some resemblance may be found in the situation of two princes, who conquered France by their valor, their policy, and the merits of a seasonable conversion.  <a name="fr_1238"></a><a href="#fn_1238"><font size="1">36</font></a> </p>

 <p>     The kingdom of the Burgundians, which was defined by the course of two Gallic rivers, the Saone and the Rhone, extended from the forest of Vosges to the Alps and the sea of Marscilles.  <a name="fr_1239"></a><a href="#fn_1239"><font size="1">37</font></a> The sceptre was in the hands of Gundobald.  That valiant and ambitious prince had reduced the number of royal candidates by the death of two brothers, one of whom was the father of Clotilda;  <a name="fr_1240"></a><a href="#fn_1240"><font size="1">38</font></a> but his imperfect prudence still permitted Godegesil, the youngest of his brothers, to possess the dependent principality of Geneva. The Arian monarch was justly alarmed by the satisfaction, and the hopes, which seemed to animate his clergy and people after the conversion of Clovis; and Gundobald convened at Lyons an assembly of his bishops, to reconcile, if it were possible, their religious and political discontents. A vain conference was agitated between the two factions.  The Arians upbraided the Catholics with the worship of three Gods: the Catholics defended their cause by theological distinctions; and the usual arguments, objections, and replies were reverberated with obstinate clamor; till the king revealed his secret apprehensions, by an abrupt but decisive question, which he addressed to the orthodox bishops.  "If you truly profess the Christian religion, why do you not restrain the king of the Franks?  He has declared war against me, and forms alliances with my enemies for my destruction.  A sanguinary and covetous mind is not the symptom of a sincere conversion: let him show his faith by his works." The answer of Avitus, bishop of Vienna, who spoke in the name of his brethren, was delivered with the voice and countenance of an angel.  "We are ignorant of the motives and intentions of the king of the Franks: but we are taught by Scripture, that the kingdoms which abandon the divine law are frequently subverted; and that enemies will arise on every side against those who have made God their enemy.  Return, with thy people, to the law of God, and he will give peace and security to thy dominions." The king of Burgundy, who was not prepared to accept the condition which the Catholics considered as essential to the treaty, delayed and dismissed the ecclesiastical conference; after reproaching his bishops, that Clovis, their friend and proselyte, had privately tempted the allegiance of his brother.  <a name="fr_1241"></a><a href="#fn_1241"><font size="1">39</font></a> </p>

 <p><a name="fn_1214"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1214">12</a> See Gregory, (l. ii. c. 27, 37, in tom. ii. p. 175, 181, 182.) The famous story of the vase of Soissons explains both the power and the character of Clovis.  As a point of controversy, it has been strangely tortured by Boulainvilliers Dubos, and the other political antiquarians.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1215"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1215">13</a> The duke of Nivernois, a noble statesman, who has managed weighty and delicate negotiations, ingeniously illustrates (Mem. de l'Acad. des Inscriptions, tom. xx. p. 147 - 184) the political system of Clovis.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1216"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1216">14</a> M. Biet (in a Dissertation which deserved the prize of the Academy of Soissons, p. 178 - 226,) has accurately defined the nature and extent of the kingdom of Syagrius and his father; but he too readily allows the slight evidence of Dubos (tom. ii. p. 54 - 57) to deprive him of Beauvais and Amiens.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1217"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1217">15</a> I may observe that Fredegarius, in his epitome of Gregory of Tours, (tom. ii. p. 398,) has prudently substituted the name of Patricius for the incredible title of Rex Romanorum.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1218"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1218">16</a> Sidonius, (l. v. Epist. 5, in tom. i. p. 794,) who styles him the Solon, the Amphion, of the Barbarians, addresses this imaginary king in the tone of friendship and equality.  From such offices of arbitration, the crafty Dejoces had raised himself to the throne of the Medes, (Herodot. l. i. c. 96 - 100.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1219"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1219">17</a> Campum sibi praeparari jussit.  M. Biet (p. 226 - 251) has diligently ascertained this field of battle, at Nogent, a Benedictine abbey, about ten miles to the north of Soissons.  The ground was marked by a circle of Pagan sepulchres; and Clovis bestowed the adjacent lands of Leully and Coucy on the church of Rheims.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1220"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1220">18</a> See Caesar. Comment. de Bell. Gallic. ii. 4, in tom. i. p. 220, and the Notitiae, tom. i. p. 126.  The three Fabricae of Soissons were, Seutaria, Balistaria, and Clinabaria.  The last supplied the complete armor of the heavy cuirassiers.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1221"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1221">19</a> The epithet must be confined to the circumstances; and history cannot justify the French prejudice of Gregory, (l. ii. c. 27, in tom. ii. p. 175,) ut Gothorum pavere mos est.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1222"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1222">20</a> Dubos has satisfied me (tom. i. p. 277 - 286) that Gregory of Tours, his transcribers, or his readers, have repeatedly confounded the German kingdom of Thuringia, beyond the Rhine, and the Gallic city of Tongria, on the Meuse, which was more anciently the country of the Eburones, and more recently the diocese of Liege.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1223"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1223">21</a> Populi habitantes juxta Lemannum lacum, Alemanni dicuntur. Servius, ad Virgil.  Georgic. iv. 278.  Don Bouquet (tom. i. p. 817) has only alleged the more recent and corrupt text of Isidore of Seville.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1224"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1224">22</a> Gregory of Tours sends St. Lupicinus inter illa Jurensis deserti secreta, quae, inter Burgundiam Alamanniamque sita, Aventicae adja cent civitati, in tom. i. p. 648.  M. de Watteville (Hist. de la Confederation Helvetique, tom. i. p. 9, 10) has accurately defined the Helvetian limits of the Duchy of Alemannia, and the Transjurane Burgundy. They were commensurate with the dioceses of Constance and Avenche, or Lausanne, and are still discriminated, in modern Switzerland, by the use of the German, or French, language.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1225"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1225">23</a> See Guilliman de Rebus Helveticis, l i. c. 3, p. 11, 12. Within the ancient walls of Vindonissa, the castle of Hapsburgh, the abbey of Konigsfield, and the town of Bruck, have successively risen.  The philosophic traveller may compare the monuments of Roman conquest of feudal or Austrian tyranny, of monkish superstition, and of industrious freedom. If he be truly a philosopher, he will applaud the merit and happiness of his own times.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1226"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1226">24</a> Gregory of Tours, (l. ii. 30, 37, in tom. ii. p. 176, 177, 182,) the Gesta Francorum, (in tom. ii. p. 551,) and the epistle of Theodoric, (Cassiodor. Variar. l. ii. c. 41, in tom. iv. p. 4,) represent the defeat of the Alemanni.  Some of their tribes settled in Rhaetia, under the protection of Theodoric; whose successors ceded the colony and their country to the grandson of Clovis.  The state of the Alemanni under the Merovingian kings may be seen in Mascou (Hist. of the Ancient Germans, xi. 8, &amp;c.  Annotation xxxvi.) and Guilliman, (de Reb. Helvet. l. ii. c. 10 - 12, p. 72 - 80.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1227"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1227">25</a> Clotilda, or rather Gregory, supposes that Clovis worshipped the gods of Greece and Rome.  The fact is incredible, and the mistake only shows how completely, in less than a century, the national religion of the Franks had been abolished and even forgotten</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1228"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1228">26</a> Gregory of Tours relates the marriage and conversion of Clovis, (l. ii. c. 28 - 31, in tom. ii. p. 175 - 178.) Even Fredegarius, or the nameless Epitomizer, (in tom. ii. p. 398 - 400,) the author of the Gesta Francorum, (in tom. ii. p. 548 - 552,) and Aimoin himself, (l. i. c. 13, in tom. iii. p. 37 - 40,) may be heard without disdain.  Tradition might long preserve some curious circumstances of these important transactions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1229"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1229">27</a> A traveller, who returned from Rheims to Auvergne, had stolen a copy of his declamations from the secretary or bookseller of the modest archbishop, (Sidonius Apollinar. l. ix. epist. 7.) Four epistles of Remigius, which are still extant, (in tom. iv. p. 51, 52, 53,) do not correspond with the splendid praise of Sidonius.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1230"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1230">28</a> Hincmar, one of the succesors of Remigius, (A.D. 845 - 882,) had composed his life, (in tom. iii. p. 373 - 380.) The authority of ancient MSS. of the church of Rheims might inspire some confidence, which is destroyed, however, by the selfish and audacious fictions of Hincmar. It is remarkable enough, that Remigius, who was consecrated at the age of twenty-two, (A.D. 457,) filled the episcopal chair seventy-four years, (Pagi Critica, in Baron tom. ii. p. 384, 572.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1231"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1231">29</a> A phial (the Sainte Ampoulle of holy, or rather celestial, oil,) was brought down by a white dove, for the baptism of Clovis; and it is still used and renewed, in the coronation of the kings of France. Hincmar (he aspired to the primacy of Gaul) is the first author of this fable, (in tom. iii. p. 377,) whose slight foundations the Abbe de Vertot (Memoires de l'Academie des Inscriptions, tom. ii. p. 619 - 633) has undermined, with profound respect and consummate dexterity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1232"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1232">30</a> Mitis depone colla, Sicamber: adora quod incendisti, incende quod adorasti.  Greg. Turon. l. ii. c. 31, in tom. ii. p. 177.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1233"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1233">31</a> Si ego ibidem cum Francis meis fuissem, injurias ejus vindicassem.  This rash expression, which Gregory has prudently concealed, is celebrated by Fredegarius, (Epitom. c. 21, in tom. ii. p. 400,) Ai moin, (l. i. c. 16, in tom. iii. p. 40,) and the Chroniques de St. Denys, (l. i. c. 20, in tom. iii. p. 171,) as an admirable effusion of Christian zeal.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1234"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1234">32</a> Gregory, (l. ii. c. 40 - 43, in tom. ii. p. 183 - 185,) after coolly relating the repeated crimes, and affected remorse, of Clovis, concludes,perhaps undesignedly, with a lesson, which ambition will never hear. "His ita transactis obiit."</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1235"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1235">33</a> After the Gothic victory, Clovis made rich offerings to St. Martin of Tours.  He wished to redeem his war-horse by the gift of one hundred pieces of gold, but the enchanted steed could not remove from the stable till the price of his redemption had been doubled.  This miracle provoked the king to exclaim, Vere B. Martinus est bonus in auxilio, sed carus in negotio. (Gesta Francorum, in tom. ii. p. 554, 555.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1236"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1236">34</a> See the epistle from Pope Anastasius to the royal convert, (in Com. iv. p. 50, 51.) Avitus, bishop of Vienna, addressed Clovis on the same subject, (p. 49;) and many of the Latin bishops would assure him of their joy and attachment.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1237"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1237">35</a> Instead of an unknown people, who now appear on the text of Procopious, Hadrian de Valois has restored the proper name of the easy correction has been almost universally approved. Yet an unprejudiced reader would naturally suppose, that Procopius means to describe a tribe of Germans in the alliance of Rome; and not a confederacy of Gallic cities, which had revolted from the empire. </p> 
 <p>     Note: Compare Hallam's Europe during the Middle Ages, vol i. p. 2, Daru, Hist. de Bretagne vol. i. p. 129 - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1238"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1238">36</a> This important digression of Procopius (de Bell. Gothic. l. i. c. 12, in tom. ii. p. 29 - 36) illustrates the origin of the French monarchy. Yet I must observe, 1. That the Greek historian betrays an inexcusable ignorance of the geography of the West.  2. That these treaties and privileges, which should leave some lasting traces, are totally invisible in Gregory of Tours, the Salic laws, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1239"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1239">37</a> Regnum circa Rhodanum aut Ararim cum provincia Massiliensi retinebant.  Greg. Turon. l. ii. c. 32, in tom. ii. p. 178.  The province of Marseilles, as far as the Durance, was afterwards ceded to the Ostrogoths; and the signatures of twenty-five bishops are supposed to represent the kingdom of Burgundy, A.D. 519.  (Concil. Epaon, in tom. iv. p. 104, 105.) Yet I would except Vindonissa.  The bishop, who lived under the Pagan Alemanni, would naturally resort to the synods of the next Christian kingdom.  Mascou (in his four first annotations) has explained many circumstances relative to the Burgundian monarchy.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1240"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1240">38</a> Mascou, (Hist. of the Germans, xi. 10,) who very reasonably distracts the testimony of Gregory of Tours, has produced a passage from Avitus (epist. v.) to prove that Gundobald affected to deplore the tragic event, which his subjects affected to applaud.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_1241"></a><a href="daf03044.htm#fr_1241">39</a> See the original conference, (in tom. iv. p. 99 - 102.) Avitus, the principal actor, and probably the secretary of the meeting, was bishop of Vienna.  A short account of his person and works may be fouud in Dupin, (Bibliotheque Ecclesiastique, tom. v. p. 5 - 10.)</p>
