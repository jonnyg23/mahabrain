 <p>     Invasion Of Italy By Alaric. - Manners Of The Roman Senate And People. - Rome Is Thrice Besieged, And At Length Pillaged, By The Goths. - Death Of Alaric. - The Goths Evacuate Italy. - Fall Of Constantine. - Gaul And Spain Are Occupied By The Barbarians. - Independence Of Britain.  </p> 
 <p>     The incapacity of a weak and distracted government may often assume the appearance, and produce the effects, of a treasonable correspondence with the public enemy.  If Alaric himself had been introduced into the council of Ravenna, he would probably have advised the same measures which were actually pursued by the ministers of Honorius.  <a name="fr_412"></a><a href="#fn_412"><font size="1">1</font></a> The king of the Goths would have conspired, perhaps with some reluctance, to destroy the formidable adversary, by whose arms, in Italy, as well as in Greece, he had been twice overthrown. Their active and interested hatred laboriously accomplished the disgrace and ruin of the great Stilicho.  The valor of Sarus, his fame in arms, and his personal, or hereditary, influence over the confederate Barbarians, could recommend him only to the friends of their country, who despised, or detested, the worthless characters of Turpilio, Varanes, and Vigilantius.  By the pressing instances of the new favorites, these generals, unworthy as they had shown themselves of the names of soldiers,  <a name="fr_413"></a><a href="#fn_413"><font size="1">2</font></a> were promoted to the command of the cavalry, of the infantry, and of the domestic troops.  The Gothic prince would have subscribed with pleasure the edict which the fanaticism of Olympius dictated to the simple and devout emperor.  Honorius excluded all persons, who were adverse to the Catholic church, from holding any office in the state; obstinately rejected the service of all those who dissented from his religion; and rashly disqualified many of his bravest and most skilful officers, who adhered to the Pagan worship, or who had imbibed the opinions of Arianism.  <a name="fr_414"></a><a href="#fn_414"><font size="1">3</font></a> These measures, so advantageous to an enemy, Alaric would have approved, and might perhaps have suggested; but it may seem doubtful, whether the Barbarian would have promoted his interest at the expense of the inhuman and absurd cruelty which was perpetrated by the direction, or at least with the connivance of the Imperial ministers.  The foreign auxiliaries, who had been attached to the person of Stilicho, lamented his death; but the desire of revenge was checked by a natural apprehension for the safety of their wives and children; who were detained as hostages in the strong cities of Italy, where they had likewise deposited their most valuable effects.  At the same hour, and as if by a common signal, the cities of Italy were polluted by the same horrid scenes of universal massacre and pillage, which involved, in promiscuous destruction, the families and fortunes of the Barbarians. Exasperated by such an injury, which might have awakened the tamest and most servile spirit, they cast a look of indignation and hope towards the camp of Alaric, and unanimously swore to pursue, with just and implacable war, the perfidious nation who had so basely violated the laws of hospitality.  By the imprudent conduct of the ministers of Honorius, the republic lost the assistance, and deserved the enmity, of thirty thousand of her bravest soldiers; and the weight of that formidable army, which alone might have determined the event of the war, was transferred from the scale of the Romans into that of the Goths.  
   
  </p> 
 <p>
  </p> 
 <p>     In the arts of negotiation, as well as in those of war, the Gothic king maintained his superior ascendant over an enemy, whose seeming changes proceeded from the total want of counsel and design.  From his camp, on the confines of Italy, Alaric attentively observed the revolutions of the palace, watched the progress of faction and discontent, disguised the hostile aspect of a Barbarian invader, and assumed the more popular appearance of the friend and ally of the great Stilicho: to whose virtues, when they were no longer formidable, he could pay a just tribute of sincere praise and regret.  The pressing invitation of the malecontents, who urged the king of the Goths to invade Italy, was enforced by a lively sense of his personal injuries; and he might especially complain, that the Imperial ministers still delayed and eluded the payment of the four thousand pounds of gold which had been granted by the Roman senate, either to reward his services, or to appease his fury. His decent firmness was supported by an artful moderation, which contributed to the success of his designs.  He required a fair and reasonable satisfaction; but he gave the strongest assurances, that, as soon as he had obtained it, he would immediately retire.  He refused to trust the faith of the Romans, unless Aetius and Jason, the sons of two great officers of state, were sent as hostages to his camp; but he offered to deliver, in exchange, several of the noblest youths of the Gothic nation.  The modesty of Alaric was interpreted, by the ministers of Ravenna, as a sure evidence of his weakness and fear.  They disdained either to negotiate a treaty, or to assemble an army; and with a rash confidence, derived only from their ignorance of the extreme danger, irretrievably wasted the decisive moments of peace and war. While they expected, in sullen silence, that the Barbarians would evacuate the confines of Italy, Alaric, with bold and rapid marches, passed the Alps and the Po; hastily pillaged the cities of Aquileia, Altinum, Concordia, and Cremona, which yielded to his arms; increased his forces by the accession of thirty thousand auxiliaries; and, without meeting a single enemy in the field, advanced as far as the edge of the morass which protected the impregnable residence of the emperor of the West.  Instead of attempting the hopeless siege of Ravenna, the prudent leader of the Goths proceeded to Rimini, stretched his ravages along the sea-coast of the Hadriatic, and meditated the conquest of the ancient mistress of the world.  An Italian hermit, whose zeal and sanctity were respected by the Barbarians themselves, encountered the victorious monarch, and boldly denounced the indignation of Heaven against the oppressors of the earth; but the saint himself was confounded by the solemn asseveration of Alaric, that he felt a secret and praeternatural impulse, which directed, and even compelled, his march to the gates of Rome.  He felt, that his genius and his fortune were equal to the most arduous enterprises; and the enthusiasm which he communicated to the Goths, insensibly removed the popular, and almost superstitious, reverence of the nations for the majesty of the Roman name. His troops, animated by the hopes of spoil, followed the course of the Flaminian way, occupied the unguarded passes of the Apennine,  <a name="fr_415"></a><a href="#fn_415"><font size="1">4</font></a> descended into the rich plains of Umbria; and, as they lay encamped on the banks of the Clitumnus, might wantonly slaughter and devour the milk-white oxen, which had been so long reserved for the use of Roman triumphs. A lofty situation, and a seasonable tempest of thunder and lightning, preserved the little city of Narni; but the king of the Goths, despising the ignoble prey, still advanced with unabated vigor; and after he had passed through the stately arches, adorned with the spoils of Barbaric victories, he pitched his camp under the walls of Rome.  <a name="fr_416"></a><a href="#fn_416"><font size="1">6</font></a>  
  </p> 
 <p>
        During a period of six hundred and nineteen years, the seat of empire had never been violated by the presence of a foreign enemy.  The unsuccessful expedition of Hannibal  <a name="fr_417"></a><a href="#fn_417"><font size="1">7</font></a> served only to display the character of the senate and people; of a senate degraded, rather than ennobled, by the comparison of an assembly of kings; and of a people, to whom the ambassador of Pyrrhus ascribed the inexhaustible resources of the Hydra.  <a name="fr_418"></a><a href="#fn_418"><font size="1">8</font></a> Each of the senators, in the time of the Punic war, had accomplished his term of the military service, either in a subordinate or a superior station; and the decree, which invested with temporary command all those who had been consuls, or censors, or dictators, gave the republic the immediate assistance of many brave and experienced generals.  In the beginning of the war, the Roman people consisted of two hundred and fifty thousand citizens of an age to bear arms.  <a name="fr_419"></a><a href="#fn_419"><font size="1">9</font></a> Fifty thousand had already died in the defence of their country; and the twenty-three legions which were employed in the different camps of Italy, Greece, Sardinia, Sicily, and Spain, required about one hundred thousand men. But there still remained an equal number in Rome, and the adjacent territory, who were animated by the same intrepid courage; and every citizen was trained, from his earliest youth, in the discipline and exercises of a soldier. Hannibal was astonished by the constancy of the senate, who, without raising the siege of Capua, or recalling their scattered forces, expected his approach. He encamped on the banks of the Anio, at the distance of three miles from the city; and he was soon informed, that the ground on which he had pitched his tent, was sold for an adequate price at a public auction;  <a name="fr_420"></a><a href="#fn_420"><font size="1">*_0015</font></a> and that a body of troops was dismissed by an opposite road, to reenforce the legions of Spain.  <a name="fr_421"></a><a href="#fn_421"><font size="1">10</font></a> He led his Africans to the gates of Rome, where he found three armies in order of battle, prepared to receive him; but Hannibal dreaded the event of a combat, from which he could not hope to escape, unless he destroyed the last of his enemies; and his speedy retreat confessed the invincible courage of the Romans. </p>

 <p>     From the time of the Punic war, the uninterrupted succession of senators had preserved the name and image of the republic; and the degenerate subjects of Honorius ambitiously derived their descent from the heroes who had repulsed the arms of Hannibal, and subdued the nations of the earth.  The temporal honors which the devout Paula  <a name="fr_422"></a><a href="#fn_422"><font size="1">11</font></a> inherited and despised, are carefully recapitulated by Jerom, the guide of her conscience, and the historian of her life.  The genealogy of her father, Rogatus, which ascended as high as Agamemnon, might seem to betray a Grecian origin; but her mother, Blaesilla, numbered the Scipios, Aemilius Paulus, and the Gracchi, in the list of her ancestors; and Toxotius, the husband of Paula, deduced his royal lineage from Aeneas, the father of the Julian line.  The vanity of the rich, who desired to be noble, was gratified by these lofty pretensions.  Encouraged by the applause of their parasites, they easily imposed on the credulity of the vulgar; and were countenanced, in some measure, by the custom of adopting the name of their patron, which had always prevailed among the freedmen and clients of illustrious families.  Most of those families, however, attacked by so many causes of external violence or internal decay, were gradually extirpated; and it would be more reasonable to seek for a lineal descent of twenty generations, among the mountains of the Alps, or in the peaceful solitude of Apulia, than on the theatre of Rome, the seat of fortune, of danger, and of perpetual revolutions.  Under each successive reign, and from every province of the empire, a crowd of hardy adventurers, rising to eminence by their talents or their vices, usurped the wealth, the honors, and the palaces of Rome; and oppressed, or protected, the poor and humble remains of consular families; who were ignorant, perhaps, of the glory of their ancestors.  <a name="fr_423"></a><a href="#fn_423"><font size="1">12</font></a> </p> 
 <p>
   
  </p> 
 <p>     In the time of Jerom and Claudian, the senators unanimously yielded the preeminence to the Anician line; and a slight view of their history will serve to appreciate the rank and antiquity of the noble families, which contended only for the second place.  <a name="fr_424"></a><a href="#fn_424"><font size="1">13</font></a> During the five first ages of the city, the name of the Anicians was unknown; they appear to have derived their origin from Praeneste; and the ambition of those new citizens was long satisfied with the Plebeian honors of tribunes of the people.  <a name="fr_425"></a><a href="#fn_425"><font size="1">14</font></a> One hundred and sixty-eight years before the Christian aera, the family was ennobled by the Praetorship of Anicius, who gloriously terminated the Illyrian war, by the conquest of the nation, and the captivity of their king.  <a name="fr_426"></a><a href="#fn_426"><font size="1">15</font></a> From the triumph of that general, three consulships, in distant periods, mark the succession of the Anician name.  <a name="fr_427"></a><a href="#fn_427"><font size="1">16</font></a> From the reign of Diocletian to the final extinction of the Western empire, that name shone with a lustre which was not eclipsed, in the public estimation, by the majesty of the Imperial purple.  <a name="fr_428"></a><a href="#fn_428"><font size="1">17</font></a> The several branches, to whom it was communicated, united, by marriage or inheritance, the wealth and titles of the Annian, the Petronian, and the Olybrian houses; and in each generation the number of consulships was multiplied by an hereditary claim.  <a name="fr_429"></a><a href="#fn_429"><font size="1">18</font></a> The Anician family excelled in faith and in riches: they were the first of the Roman senate who embraced Christianity; and it is probable that Anicius Julian, who was afterwards consul and praefect of the city, atoned for his attachment to the party of Maxentius, by the readiness with which he accepted the religion of Constantine.  <a name="fr_430"></a><a href="#fn_430"><font size="1">19</font></a> Their ample patrimony was increased by the industry of Probus, the chief of the Anician family; who shared with Gratian the honors of the consulship, and exercised, four times, the high office of Praetorian praefect.  <a name="fr_431"></a><a href="#fn_431"><font size="1">20</font></a> His immense estates were scattered over the wide extent of the Roman world; and though the public might suspect or disapprove the methods by which they had been acquired, the generosity and magnificence of that fortunate statesman deserved the gratitude of his clients, and the admiration of strangers.  <a name="fr_432"></a><a href="#fn_432"><font size="1">21</font></a> Such was the respect entertained for his memory, that the two sons of Probus, in their earliest youth, and at the request of the senate, were associated in the consular dignity; a memorable distinction, without example, in the annals of Rome.  <a name="fr_433"></a><a href="#fn_433"><font size="1">22</font></a> </p>

 <p><a name="fn_412"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_412">1</a> The series of events, from the death of Stilicho to the arrival of Alaric before Rome, can only be found in Zosimus, l. v. p. 347 - 350.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_413"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_413">2</a> The expression of Zosimus is strong and lively, sufficient to excite the contempt of the enemy.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_414"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_414">3</a> Eos qui catholicae sectae sunt inimici, intra palatium militare pro hibemus.  Nullus nobis sit aliqua ratione conjunctus, qui a nobis fidest religione discordat.  Cod. Theodos. l. xvi. tit. v. leg. 42, and Godefroy's Commentary, tom. vi. p. 164.  This law was applied in the utmost latitude, and rigorously executed.  Zosimus, l. v. p. 364.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_415"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_415">4</a> Addison (see his Works, vol. ii. p. 54, edit. Baskerville) has given a very picturesque description of the road through the Apennine.  The Goths were not at leisure to observe the beauties of the prospect; but they were pleased to find that the Saxa Intercisa, a narrow passage which Vespasian had cut through the rock, (Cluver. Italia Antiq. tom. i. p. 168,) was totally neglected. </p> 
 <p>     Hine albi, Clitumne, greges, et maxima taurus      Victima, saepe tuo perfusi flumine sacro,      Romanos ad templa Deum duxere triumphos. </p> 
 <p>     Georg. ii. 147. </p> 
 <p>Besides Virgil, most of the Latin poets, Propertius, Lucan, Silius Italicus, Claudian, &amp;c., whose passages may be found in Cluverius and Addison, have celebrated the triumphal victims of the Clitumnus.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_416"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_416">6</a> Some ideas of the march of Alaric are borrowed from the journey of Honorius over the same ground.  (See Claudian in vi. Cons. Hon. 494 - 522.) The measured distance between Ravenna and Rome was 254 Roman miles.  Itinerar. Wesseling, p. 126.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_417"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_417">7</a> The march and retreat of Hannibal are described by Livy, l. xxvi. c. 7, 8, 9, 10, 11; and the reader is made a spectator of the interesting scene.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_418"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_418">8</a> These comparisons were used by Cyneas, the counsellor of Pyrrhus, after his return from his embassy, in which he had diligently studied the discipline and manners of Rome.  See Plutarch in Pyrrho. tom. ii. p. 459.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_419"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_419">9</a> In the three census which were made of the Roman people, about the time of the second Punic war, the numbers stand as follows, (see Livy, Epitom. l. xx. Hist. l. xxvii. 36. xxix. 37:) 270,213, 137,108 214,000. The fall of the second, and the rise of the third, appears so enormous, that several critics, notwithstanding the unanimity of the Mss., have suspected some corruption of the text of Livy.  (See Drakenborch ad xxvii. 36, and Beaufort, Republique Romaine, tom. i. p. 325.) They did not consider that the second census was taken only at Rome, and that the numbers were diminished, not only by the death, but likewise by the absence, of many soldiers.  In the third census, Livy expressly affirms, that the legions were mustered by the care of particular commissaries. From the numbers on the list we must always deduct one twelfth above threescore, and incapable of bearing arms.  See Population de la France, p. 72.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_420"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_420">*_0015</a> Compare the remarkable transaction in Jeremiah xxxii. 6, to 44, where the prophet purchases his uncle's estate at the approach of the Babylonian captivity, in his undoubting confidence in the future restoration of the people.  In the one case it is the triumph of religious faith, in the other of national pride. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_421"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_421">10</a> Livy considers these two incidents as the effects only of chance and courage.  I suspect that they were both managed by the admirable policy of the senate.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_422"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_422">11</a> See Jerom, tom. i. p. 169, 170, ad Eustochium; he bestows on Paula the splendid titles of Gracchorum stirps, soboles Scipionum, Pauli haeres, cujus vocabulum trahit, Martiae Papyriae Matris Africani vera et germana propago.  This particular description supposes a more solid title than the surname of Julius, which Toxotius shared with a thousand families of the western provinces.  See the Index of Tacitus, of Gruter's Inscriptions, &amp;c.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_423"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_423">12</a> Tacitus (Annal. iii. 55) affirms, that between the battle of Actium and the reign of Vespasian, the senate was gradually filled with new families from the Municipia and colonies of Italy.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_424"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_424">13</a>  Nec quisquam Procerum tentet (licet aere vetusto                Floreat, et claro cingatur Roma senatu)                Se jactare parem; sed prima sede relicta                Aucheniis, de jure licet certare secundo. </p> 
 <p>               Claud. in Prob. et Olybrii Coss. 18. </p> 
 <p>Such a compliment paid to the obscure name of the Auchenii has amazed the critics; but they all agree, that whatever may be the true reading, the sense of Claudian can be applied only to the Anician family.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_425"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_425">14</a> The earliest date in the annals of Pighius, is that of M. Anicius Gallus. Trib. Pl. A. U. C. 506.  Another tribune, Q. Anicius, A. U. C. 508, is distinguished by the epithet of Praenestinus.  Livy (xlv. 43) places the Anicii below the great families of Rome.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_426"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_426">15</a> Livy, xliv. 30, 31, xlv. 3, 26, 43.  He fairly appreciates the merit of Anicius, and justly observes, that his fame was clouded by the superior lustre of the Macedonian, which preceded the Illyrian triumph.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_427"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_427">16</a> The dates of the three consulships are, A. U. C. 593, 818, 967 the two last under the reigns of Nero and Caracalla.  The second of these consuls distinguished himself only by his infamous flattery, (Tacit. Annal. xv. 74;) but even the evidence of crimes, if they bear the stamp of greatness and antiquity, is admitted, without reluctance, to prove the genealogy of a noble house.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_428"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_428">17</a> In the sixth century, the nobility of the Anician name is mentioned (Cassiodor. Variar. l. x. Ep. 10, 12) with singular respect by the minister of a Gothic king of Italy.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_429"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_429">18</a> -     Fixus in omnes                     Cognatos procedit honos; quemcumque requiras                     Hac de stirpe virum, certum est de Consule nasci.                     Per fasces numerantur Avi, semperque renata                     Nobilitate virent, et prolem fata sequuntur.  (Claudian in Prob. et Olyb. Consulat. 12, &amp;c.) The Annii, whose name seems to have merged in the Anician, mark the Fasti with many consulships, from the time of Vespasian to the fourth century.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_430"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_430">19</a> The title of first Christian senator may be justified by the authority of Prudentius (in Symmach. i. 553) and the dislike of the Pagans to the Anician family.  See Tillemont, Hist. des Empereurs, tom. iv. p. 183, v. p. 44.  Baron. Annal. A.D. 312, No. 78, A.D. 322, No. 2.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_431"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_431">20</a> Probus ... claritudine generis et potentia et opum magnitudine, cognitus Orbi Romano, per quem universum poene patrimonia sparsa possedit, juste an secus non judicioli est nostri.  Ammian Marcellin. xxvii. 11.  His children and widow erected for him a magnificent tomb in the Vatican, which was demolished in the time of Pope Nicholas V. to make room for the new church of St.Peter Baronius, who laments the ruin of this Christian monument, has diligently preserved the inscriptions and basso-relievos.  See Annal. Eccles. A.D. 395, No. 5 - 17.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_432"></a><a href="daf03016.htm#fr_432">21</a> Two Persian satraps travelled to Milan and Rome, to hear St. Ambrose, and to see Probus, (Paulin. in Vit. Ambros.) Claudian (in Cons. Probin. et Olybr. 30 - 60) seems at a loss how to express the glory of Probus.</p>
