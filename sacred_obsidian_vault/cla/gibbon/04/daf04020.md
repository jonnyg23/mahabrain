 <p>     The prudence of Narses impelled him to speedy and decisive action.  His powers were the last effort of the state; the cost of each day accumulated the enormous account; and the nations, untrained to discipline or fatigue, might be rashly provoked to turn their arms against each other, or against their benefactor.  The same considerations might have tempered the ardor of Totila. But he was conscious that the clergy and people of Italy aspired to a second revolution: he felt or suspected the rapid progress of treason; and he resolved to risk the Gothic kingdom on the chance of a day, in which the valiant would be animated by instant danger and the disaffected might be awed by mutual ignorance.  In his march from Ravenna, the Roman general chastised the garrison of Rimini, traversed in a direct line the hills of Urbino, and reentered the Flaminian way, nine miles beyond the perforated rock, an obstacle of art and nature which might have stopped or retarded his progress.  <a name="fr_561"></a><a href="#fn_561"><font size="1">34</font></a> The Goths were assembled in the neighborhood of Rome, they advanced without delay to seek a superior enemy, and the two armies approached each other at the distance of one hundred furlongs, between Tagina  <a name="fr_562"></a><a href="#fn_562"><font size="1">35</font></a> and the sepulchres of the Gauls.  <a name="fr_563"></a><a href="#fn_563"><font size="1">36</font></a> The haughty message of Narses was an offer, not of peace, but of pardon.  The answer of the Gothic king declared his resolution to die or conquer.  "What day," said the messenger, "will you fix for the combat?" "The eighth day," replied Totila; but early the next morning he attempted to surprise a foe, suspicious of deceit, and prepared for battle. Ten thousand Heruli and Lombards, of approved valor and doubtful faith, were placed in the centre.  Each of the wings was composed of eight thousand Romans; the right was guarded by the cavalry of the Huns, the left was covered by fifteen hundred chosen horse, destined, according to the emergencies of action, to sustain the retreat of their friends, or to encompass the flank of the enemy.  From his proper station at the head of the right wing, the eunuch rode along the line, expressing by his voice and countenance the assurance of victory; exciting the soldiers of the emperor to punish the guilt and madness of a band of robbers; and exposing to their view gold chains, collars, and bracelets, the rewards of military virtue.  From the event of a single combat they drew an omen of success; and they beheld with pleasure the courage of fifty archers, who maintained a small eminence against three successive attacks of the Gothic cavalry.  At the distance only of two bow-shots, the armies spent the morning in dreadful suspense, and the Romans tasted some necessary food, without unloosing the cuirass from their breast, or the bridle from their horses.  Narses awaited the charge; and it was delayed by Totila till he had received his last succors of two thousand Goths.  While he consumed the hours in fruitless treaty, the king exhibited in a narrow space the strength and agility of a warrior.  His armor was enchased with gold; his purple banner floated with the wind: he cast his lance into the air; caught it with the right hand; shifted it to the left; threw himself backwards; recovered his seat; and managed a fiery steed in all the paces and evolutions of the equestrian school.  As soon as the succors had arrived, he retired to his tent, assumed the dress and arms of a private soldier, and gave the signal of a battle.  The first line of cavalry advanced with more courage than discretion, and left behind them the infantry of the second line.  They were soon engaged between the horns of a crescent, into which the adverse wings had been insensibly curved, and were saluted from either side by the volleys of four thousand archers.  Their ardor, and even their distress, drove them forwards to a close and unequal conflict, in which they could only use their lances against an enemy equally skilled in all the instruments of war.  A generous emulation inspired the Romans and their Barbarian allies; and Narses, who calmly viewed and directed their efforts, doubted to whom he should adjudge the prize of superior bravery.  The Gothic cavalry was astonished and disordered, pressed and broken; and the line of infantry, instead of presenting their spears, or opening their intervals, were trampled under the feet of the flying horse.  Six thousand of the Goths were slaughtered without mercy in the field of Tagina.  Their prince, with five attendants, was overtaken by Asbad, of the race of the Gepidae.  "Spare the king of Italy,"  <a name="fr_564"></a><a href="#fn_564"><font size="1">*_0040</font></a> cried a loyal voice, and Asbad struck his lance through the body of Totila. The blow was instantly revenged by the faithful Goths: they transported their dying monarch seven miles beyond the scene of his disgrace; and his last moments were not imbittered by the presence of an enemy.  Compassion afforded him the shelter of an obscure tomb; but the Romans were not satisfied of their victory, till they beheld the corpse of the Gothic king.  His hat, enriched with gems, and his bloody robe, were presented to Justinian by the messengers of triumph.  <a name="fr_565"></a><a href="#fn_565"><font size="1">37</font></a> </p>

        As soon as Narses had paid his devotions to the Author of victory, and the blessed Virgin, his peculiar patroness,  <a name="fr_566"></a><a href="#fn_566"><font size="1">38</font></a> he praised, rewarded, and dismissed the Lombards.  The villages had been reduced to ashes by these valiant savages; they ravished matrons and virgins on the altar; their retreat was diligently watched by a strong detachment of regular forces, who prevented a repetition of the like disorders.  The victorious eunuch pursued his march through Tuscany, accepted the submission of the Goths, heard the acclamations, and often the complaints, of the Italians, and encompassed the walls of Rome with the remainder of his formidable host.  Round the wide circumference, Narses assigned to himself, and to each of his lieutenants, a real or a feigned attack, while he silently marked the place of easy and unguarded entrance.  Neither the fortifications of Hadrian's mole, nor of the port, could long delay the progress of the conqueror; and Justinian once more received the keys of Rome, which, under his reign, had been five times taken and recovered.  <a name="fr_567"></a><a href="#fn_567"><font size="1">39</font></a> But the deliverance of Rome was the last calamity of the Roman people.  The Barbarian allies of Narses too frequently confounded the privileges of peace and war.  The despair of the flying Goths found some consolation in sanguinary revenge; and three hundred youths of the noblest families, who had been sent as hostages beyond the Po, were inhumanly slain by the successor of Totila.  The fate of the senate suggests an awful lesson of the vicissitude of human affairs.  Of the senators whom Totila had banished from their country, some were rescued by an officer of Belisarius, and transported from Campania to Sicily; while others were too guilty to confide in the clemency of Justinian, or too poor to provide horses for their escape to the sea-shore.  Their brethren languished five years in a state of indigence and exile: the victory of Narses revived their hopes; but their premature return to the metropolis was prevented by the furious Goths; and all the fortresses of Campania were stained with patrician  <a name="fr_568"></a><a href="#fn_568"><font size="1">40</font></a> blood.  After a period of thirteen centuries, the institution of Romulus expired; and if the nobles of Rome still assumed the title of senators, few subsequent traces can be discovered of a public council, or constitutional order.  Ascend six hundred years, and contemplate the kings of the earth soliciting an audience, as the slaves or freedmen of the Roman senate!  <a name="fr_569"></a><a href="#fn_569"><font size="1">41</font></a> </p>

 <p>     In the year 536 by Belisarius, in 546 by Totila, in 547 by Belisarius, in 549 by Totila, and in 552 by Narses.  Maltretus had inadvertently translated sextum; a mistake which he afterwards retracts; out the mischief was done; and Cousin, with a train of French and Latin readers, have fallen into the snare.

  </p> 
 <p>     The Gothic war was yet alive.  The bravest of the nation retired beyond the Po; and Teias was unanimously chosen to succeed and revenge their departed hero.  The new king immediately sent ambassadors to implore, or rather to purchase, the aid of the Franks, and nobly lavished, for the public safety, the riches which had been deposited in the palace of Pavia.  The residue of the royal treasure was guarded by his brother Aligern, at Cumaea, in Campania; but the strong castle which Totila had fortified was closely besieged by the arms of Narses.  From the Alps to the foot of Mount Vesuvius, the Gothic king, by rapid and secret marches, advanced to the relief of his brother, eluded the vigilance of the Roman chiefs, and pitched his camp on the banks of the Sarnus or Draco,  <a name="fr_570"></a><a href="#fn_570"><font size="1">42</font></a> which flows from Nuceria into the Bay of Naples.  The river separated the two armies: sixty days were consumed in distant and fruitless combats, and Teias maintained this important post till he was deserted by his fleet and the hope of subsistence.  With reluctant steps he ascended the Lactarian mount, where the physicians of Rome, since the time of Galen, had sent their patients for the benefit of the air and the milk.  <a name="fr_571"></a><a href="#fn_571"><font size="1">43</font></a> But the Goths soon embraced a more generous resolution: to descend the hill, to dismiss their horses, and to die in arms, and in the possession of freedom.  The king marched at their head, bearing in his right hand a lance, and an ample buckler in his left: with the one he struck dead the foremost of the assailants; with the other he received the weapons which every hand was ambitious to aim against his life.  After a combat of many hours, his left arm was fatigued by the weight of twelve javelins which hung from his shield.  Without moving from his ground, or suspending his blows, the hero called aloud on his attendants for a fresh buckler; but in the moment while his side was uncovered, it was pierced by a mortal dart.  He fell; and his head, exalted on a spear, proclaimed to the nations that the Gothic kingdom was no more.  But the example of his death served only to animate the companions who had sworn to perish with their leader.  They fought till darkness descended on the earth. They reposed on their arms. The combat was renewed with the return of light, and maintained with unabated vigor till the evening of the second day.  The repose of a second night, the want of water, and the loss of their bravest champions, determined the surviving Goths to accept the fair capitulation which the prudence of Narses was inclined to propose.  They embraced the alternative of residing in Italy, as the subjects and soldiers of Justinian, or departing with a portion of their private wealth, in search of some independent country.  <a name="fr_572"></a><a href="#fn_572"><font size="1">44</font></a> Yet the oath of fidelity or exile was alike rejected by one thousand Goths, who broke away before the treaty was signed, and boldly effected their retreat to the walls of Pavia.  The spirit, as well as the situation, of Aligern prompted him to imitate rather than to bewail his brother: a strong and dexterous archer, he transpierced with a single arrow the armor and breast of his antagonist; and his military conduct defended Cumae  <a name="fr_573"></a><a href="#fn_573"><font size="1">45</font></a> above a year against the forces of the Romans.  Their industry had scooped the Sibyl's cave  <a name="fr_574"></a><a href="#fn_574"><font size="1">46</font></a> into a prodigious mine; combustible materials were introduced to consume the temporary props: the wall and the gate of Cumae sunk into the cavern, but the ruins formed a deep and inaccessible precipice. On the fragment of a rock Aligern stood alone and unshaken, till he calmly surveyed the hopeless condition of his country, and judged it more honorable to be the friend of Narses, than the slave of the Franks.  After the death of Teias, the Roman general separated his troops to reduce the cities of Italy; Lucca sustained a long and vigorous siege: and such was the humanity or the prudence of Narses, that the repeated perfidy of the inhabitants could not provoke him to exact the forfeit lives of their hostages.  These hostages were dismissed in safety; and their grateful zeal at length subdued the obstinacy of their countrymen.  <a name="fr_575"></a><a href="#fn_575"><font size="1">47</font></a> </p>

 <p>     Before Lucca had surrendered, Italy was overwhelmed by a new deluge of Barbarians.  A feeble youth, the grandson of Clovis, reigned over the Austrasians or oriental Franks.  The guardians of Theodebald entertained with coldness and reluctance the magnificent promises of the Gothic ambassadors. But the spirit of a martial people outstripped the timid counsels of the court: two brothers, Lothaire and Buccelin,  <a name="fr_576"></a><a href="#fn_576"><font size="1">48</font></a> the dukes of the Alemanni, stood forth as the leaders of the Italian war; and seventy-five thousand Germans descended in the autumn from the Rhaetian Alps into the plain of Milan.  The vanguard of the Roman army was stationed near the Po, under the conduct of Fulcaris, a bold Herulian, who rashly conceived that personal bravery was the sole duty and merit of a commander.  As he marched without order or precaution along the Aemilian way, an ambuscade of Franks suddenly rose from the amphitheatre of Parma; his troops were surprised and routed; but their leader refused to fly; declaring to the last moment, that death was less terrible than the angry countenance of Narses.  <a name="fr_577"></a><a href="#fn_577"><font size="1">*_0041</font></a> The death of Fulcaris, and the retreat of the surviving chiefs, decided the fluctuating and rebellious temper of the Goths; they flew to the standard of their deliverers, and admitted them into the cities which still resisted the arms of the Roman general.  The conqueror of Italy opened a free passage to the irresistible torrent of Barbarians.  They passed under the walls of Cesena, and answered by threats and reproaches the advice of Aligern,  <a name="fr_578"></a><a href="#fn_578"><font size="1">!_0041</font></a> that the Gothic treasures could no longer repay the labor of an invasion.  Two thousand Franks were destroyed by the skill and valor of Narses himself, who sailed from Rimini at the head of three hundred horse, to chastise the licentious rapine of their march.  On the confines of Samnium the two brothers divided their forces. With the right wing, Buccelin assumed the spoil of Campania, Lucania, and Bruttium; with the left, Lothaire accepted the plunder of Apulia and Calabria. They followed the coast of the Mediterranean and the Adriatic, as far as Rhegium and Otranto, and the extreme lands of Italy were the term of their destructive progress.  The Franks, who were Christians and Catholics, contented themselves with simple pillage and occasional murder.  But the churches which their piety had spared, were stripped by the sacrilegious hands of the Alamanni, who sacrificed horses' heads to their native deities of the woods and rivers;  <a name="fr_579"></a><a href="#fn_579"><font size="1">49</font></a> they melted or profaned the consecrated vessels, and the ruins of shrines and altars were stained with the blood of the faithful. Buccelin was actuated by ambition, and Lothaire by avarice.  The former aspired to restore the Gothic kingdom; the latter, after a promise to his brother of speedy succors, returned by the same road to deposit his treasure beyond the Alps.  The strength of their armies was already wasted by the change of climate and contagion of disease: the Germans revelled in the vintage of Italy; and their own intemperance avenged, in some degree, the miseries of a defenceless people.  <a name="fr_580"></a><a href="#fn_580"><font size="1">**_0041</font></a> </p>

        At the entrance of the spring, the Imperial troops, who had guarded the cities, assembled, to the number of eighteen thousand men, in the neighborhood of Rome.  Their winter hours had not been consumed in idleness. By the command, and after the example, of Narses, they repeated each day their military exercise on foot and on horseback, accustomed their ear to obey the sound of the trumpet, and practised the steps and evolutions of the Pyrrhic dance.  From the Straits of Sicily, Buccelin, with thirty thousand Franks and Alamanni, slowly moved towards Capua, occupied with a wooden tower the bridge of Casilinum, covered his right by the stream of the Vulturnus, and secured the rest of his encampment by a rampart of sharp stakes, and a circle of wagons, whose wheels were buried in the earth.  He impatiently expected the return of Lothaire; ignorant, alas!  that his brother could never return, and that the chief and his army had been swept away by a strange disease  <a name="fr_581"></a><a href="#fn_581"><font size="1">50</font></a> on the banks of the Lake Benacus, between Trent and Verona.  The banners of Narses soon approached the Vulturnus, and the eyes of Italy were anxiously fixed on the event of this final contest.  Perhaps the talents of the Roman general were most conspicuous in the calm operations which precede the tumult of a battle.  His skilful movements intercepted the subsistence of the Barbarian deprived him of the advantage of the bridge and river, and in the choice of the ground and moment of action reduced him to comply with the inclination of his enemy.  On the morning of the important day, when the ranks were already formed, a servant, for some trivial fault, was killed by his master, one of the leaders of the Heruli.  The justice or passion of Narses was awakened: he summoned the offender to his presence, and without listening to his excuses, gave the signal to the minister of death. If the cruel master had not infringed the laws of his nation, this arbitrary execution was not less unjust than it appears to have been imprudent.  The Heruli felt the indignity; they halted: but the Roman general, without soothing their rage, or expecting their resolution, called aloud, as the trumpets sounded, that unless they hastened to occupy their place, they would lose the honor of the victory. His troops were disposed  <a name="fr_582"></a><a href="#fn_582"><font size="1">51</font></a> in a long front, the cavalry on the wings; in the centre, the heavy-armed foot; the archers and slingers in the rear.  The Germans advanced in a sharp-pointed column, of the form of a triangle or solid wedge.  They pierced the feeble centre of Narses, who received them with a smile into the fatal snare, and directed his wings of cavalry insensibly to wheel on their flanks and encompass their rear.  The host of the Franks and Alamanni consisted of infantry: a sword and buckler hung by their side; and they used, as their weapons of offence, a weighty hatchet and a hooked javelin, which were only formidable in close combat, or at a short distance. The flower of the Roman archers, on horseback, and in complete armor, skirmished without peril round this immovable phalanx; supplied by active speed the deficiency of number; and aimed their arrows against a crowd of Barbarians, who, instead of a cuirass and helmet, were covered by a loose garment of fur or linen.  They paused, they trembled, their ranks were confounded, and in the decisive moment the Heruli, preferring glory to revenge, charged with rapid violence the head of the column.  Their leader, Sinbal, and Aligern, the Gothic prince, deserved the prize of superior valor; and their example excited the victorious troops to achieve with swords and spears the destruction of the enemy.  Buccelin, and the greatest part of his army, perished on the field of battle, in the waters of the Vulturnus, or by the hands of the enraged peasants: but it may seem incredible, that a victory,  <a name="fr_583"></a><a href="#fn_583"><font size="1">52</font></a> which no more than five of the Alamanni survived, could be purchased with the loss of fourscore Romans.  Seven thousand Goths, the relics of the war, defended the fortress of Campsa till the ensuing spring; and every messenger of Narses announced the reduction of the Italian cities, whose names were corrupted by the ignorance or vanity of the Greeks.  <a name="fr_584"></a><a href="#fn_584"><font size="1">53</font></a> After the battle of Casilinum, Narses entered the capital; the arms and treasures of the Goths, the Franks, and the Alamanni, were displayed; his soldiers, with garlands in their hands, chanted the praises of the conqueror; and Rome, for the last time, beheld the semblance of a triumph. </p>

  </p> 
 <p>     After a reign of sixty years, the throne of the Gothic kings was filled by the exarchs of Ravenna, the representatives in peace and war of the emperor of the Romans.  Their jurisdiction was soon reduced to the limits of a narrow province: but Narses himself, the first and most powerful of the exarchs, administered above fifteen years the entire kingdom of Italy.  Like Belisarius, he had deserved the honors of envy, calumny, and disgrace: but the favorite eunuch still enjoyed the confidence of Justinian; or the leader of a victorious army awed and repressed the ingratitude of a timid court. Yet it was not by weak and mischievous indulgence that Narses secured the attachment of his troops.  Forgetful of the past, and regardless of the future, they abused the present hour of prosperity and peace.  The cities of Italy resounded with the noise of drinking and dancing; the spoils of victory were wasted in sensual pleasures; and nothing (says Agathias) remained unless to exchange their shields and helmets for the soft lute and the capacious hogshead.  <a name="fr_585"></a><a href="#fn_585"><font size="1">54</font></a> In a manly oration, not unworthy of a Roman censor, the eunuch reproved these disorderly vices, which sullied their fame, and endangered their safety.  The soldiers blushed and obeyed; discipline was confirmed; the fortifications were restored; a duke was stationed for the defence and military command of each of the principal cities;  <a name="fr_586"></a><a href="#fn_586"><font size="1">55</font></a> and the eye of Narses pervaded the ample prospect from Calabria to the Alps.  The remains of the Gothic nation evacuated the country, or mingled with the people; the Franks, instead of revenging the death of Buccelin, abandoned, without a struggle, their Italian conquests; and the rebellious Sinbal, chief of the Heruli, was subdued, taken and hung on a lofty gallows by the inflexible justice of the exarch.  <a name="fr_587"></a><a href="#fn_587"><font size="1">56</font></a> The civil state of Italy, after the agitation of a long tempest, was fixed by a pragmatic sanction, which the emperor promulgated at the request of the pope.  Justinian introduced his own jurisprudence into the schools and tribunals of the West; he ratified the acts of Theodoric and his immediate successors, but every deed was rescinded and abolished which force had extorted, or fear had subscribed, under the usurpation of Totila.  A moderate theory was framed to reconcile the rights of property with the safety of prescription, the claims of the state with the poverty of the people, and the pardon of offences with the interest of virtue and order of society. Under the exarchs of Ravenna, Rome was degraded to the second rank. Yet the senators were gratified by the permission of visiting their estates in Italy, and of approaching, without obstacle, the throne of Constantinople: the regulation of weights and measures was delegated to the pope and senate; and the salaries of lawyers and physicians, of orators and grammarians, were destined to preserve, or rekindle, the light of science in the ancient capital.  Justinian might dictate benevolent edicts,  <a name="fr_588"></a><a href="#fn_588"><font size="1">57</font></a> and Narses might second his wishes by the restoration of cities, and more especially of churches.  But the power of kings is most effectual to destroy; and the twenty years of the Gothic war had consummated the distress and depopulation of Italy.  As early as the fourth campaign, under the discipline of Belisarius himself, fifty thousand laborers died of hunger  <a name="fr_589"></a><a href="#fn_589"><font size="1">58</font></a> in the narrow region of Picenum;  <a name="fr_590"></a><a href="#fn_590"><font size="1">59</font></a> and a strict interpretation of the evidence of Procopius would swell the loss of Italy above the total sum of her present inhabitants.  <a name="fr_591"></a><a href="#fn_591"><font size="1">60</font></a>

 <p>     I desire to believe, but I dare not affirm, that Belisarius sincerely rejoiced in the triumph of Narses.  Yet the consciousness of his own exploits might teach him to esteem without jealousy the merit of a rival; and the repose of the aged warrior was crowned by a last victory, which saved the emperor and the capital.  The Barbarians, who annually visited the provinces of Europe, were less discouraged by some accidental defeats, than they were excited by the double hope of spoil and of subsidy.  In the thirty-second winter of Justinian's reign, the Danube was deeply frozen: Zabergan led the cavalry of the Bulgarians, and his standard was followed by a promiscuous multitude of Sclavonians.  <a name="fr_592"></a><a href="#fn_592"><font size="1">*_0042</font></a> The savage chief passed, without opposition, the river and the mountains, spread his troops over Macedonia and Thrace, and advanced with no more than seven thousand horse to the long wall, which should have defended the territory of Constantinople.  But the works of man are impotent against the assaults of nature: a recent earthquake had shaken the foundations of the wall; and the forces of the empire were employed on the distant frontiers of Italy, Africa, and Persia.  The seven schools,  <a name="fr_593"></a><a href="#fn_593"><font size="1">61</font></a> or companies of the guards or domestic troops, had been augmented to the number of five thousand five hundred men, whose ordinary station was in the peaceful cities of Asia.  But the places of the brave Armenians were insensibly supplied by lazy citizens, who purchased an exemption from the duties of civil life, without being exposed to the dangers of military service.  Of such soldiers, few could be tempted to sally from the gates; and none could be persuaded to remain in the field, unless they wanted strength and speed to escape from the Bulgarians.  The report of the fugitives exaggerated the numbers and fierceness of an enemy, who had polluted holy virgins, and abandoned new-born infants to the dogs and vultures; a crowd of rustics, imploring food and protection, increased the consternation of the city, and the tents of Zabergan were pitched at the distance of twenty miles,  <a name="fr_594"></a><a href="#fn_594"><font size="1">62</font></a> on the banks of a small river, which encircles Melanthias, and afterwards falls into the Propontis.  <a name="fr_595"></a><a href="#fn_595"><font size="1">63</font></a> Justinian trembled: and those who had only seen the emperor in his old age, were pleased to suppose, that he had lost the alacrity and vigor of his youth.  By his command the vessels of gold and silver were removed from the churches in the neighborhood, and even the suburbs, of Constantinople; the ramparts were lined with trembling spectators; the golden gate was crowded with useless generals and tribunes, and the senate shared the fatigues and the apprehensions of the populace. </p>

        But the eyes of the prince and people were directed to a feeble veteran, who was compelled by the public danger to resume the armor in which he had entered Carthage and defended Rome.  The horses of the royal stables, of private citizens, and even of the circus, were hastily collected; the emulation of the old and young was roused by the name of Belisarius, and his first encampment was in the presence of a victorious enemy.  His prudence, and the labor of the friendly peasants, secured, with a ditch and rampart, the repose of the night; innumerable fires, and clouds of dust, were artfully contrived to magnify the opinion of his strength; his soldiers suddenly passed from despondency to presumption; and, while ten thousand voices demanded the battle, Belisarius dissembled his knowledge, that in the hour of trial he must depend on the firmness of three hundred veterans.  The next morning the Bulgarian cavalry advanced to the charge.  But they heard the shouts of multitudes, they beheld the arms and discipline of the front; they were assaulted on the flanks by two ambuscades which rose from the woods; their foremost warriors fell by the hand of the aged hero and his gnards; and the swiftness of their evolutions was rendered useless by the close attack and rapid pursuit of the Romans.  In this action (so speedy was their flight) the Bulgarians lost only four hundred horse; but Constantinople was saved; and Zabergan, who felt the hand of a master, withdrew to a respectful distance. But his friends were numerous in the councils of the emperor, and Belisarius obeyed with reluctance the commands of envy and Justinian, which forbade him to achieve the deliverance of his country.  On his return to the city, the people, still conscious of their danger, accompanied his triumph with acclamations of joy and gratitude, which were imputed as a crime to the victorious general.  But when he entered the palace, the courtiers were silent, and the emperor, after a cold and thankless embrace, dismissed him to mingle with the train of slaves.  Yet so deep was the impression of his glory on the minds of men, that Justinian, in the seventy-seventh year of his age, was encouraged to advance near forty miles from the capital, and to inspect in person the restoration of the long wall.  The Bulgarians wasted the summer in the plains of Thrace; but they were inclined to peace by the failure of their rash attempts on Greece and the Chersonesus.  A menace of killing their prisoners quickened the payment of heavy ransoms; and the departure of Zabergan was hastened by the report, that double-prowed vessels were built on the Danube to intercept his passage.  The danger was soon forgotten; and a vain question, whether their sovereign had shown more wisdom or weakness, amused the idleness of the city.  <a name="fr_596"></a><a href="#fn_596"><font size="1">64</font></a> </p>

 <p><a name="fn_561"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_561">34</a> The Flaminian way, as it is corrected from the Itineraries, and the best modern maps, by D'Anville, (Analyse de l'Italie, p. 147 - 162,) may be thus stated: Rome to Narni, 51 Roman miles; Terni, 57; Spoleto, 75; Foligno, 88; Nocera, 103; Cagli, 142; Intercisa, 157; Fossombrone, 160; Fano, 176; Pesaro, 184; Rimini, 208 - about 189 English miles.  He takes no notice of the death of Totila; but West selling (Itinerar. p. 614) exchanges, for the field of Taginas, the unknown appellation of Ptanias, eight miles from Nocera.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_562"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_562">35</a> Taginae, or rather Tadinae, is mentioned by Pliny; but the bishopric of that obscure town, a mile from Gualdo, in the plain, was united, in the year 1007, with that of Nocera.  The signs of antiquity are preserved in the local appellations, Fossato, the camp; Capraia, Caprea; Bastia, Busta Gallorum.  See Cluverius, (Italia Antiqua, l. ii. c. 6, p. 615, 616, 617,) Lucas Holstenius, (Annotat. ad Cluver. p. 85, 86,) Guazzesi, (Dissertat. p. 177 - 217, a professed inquiry,) and the maps of the ecclesiastical state and the march of Ancona, by Le Maire and Magini.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_563"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_563">36</a> The battle was fought in the year of Rome 458; and the consul Decius, by devoting his own life, assured the triumph of his country and his colleague Fabius, (T. Liv. x. 28, 29.) Procopius ascribes to Camillus the victory of the Busta Gallorum; and his error is branded by Cluverius with the national reproach of Graecorum nugamenta.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_564"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_564">*_0040</a> "Dog, wilt thou strike thy Lord?" was the more characteristic exclamation of the Gothic youth.  Procop. lib. iv. p. 32. - M.</p>

 <p><a name="fn_568"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_568">40</a> Compare two passages of Procopius, (l. iii. c. 26, l. iv. c. 24,) which, with some collateral hints from Marcellinus and Jornandes, illustrate the state of the expiring senate.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_569"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_569">41</a> See, in the example of Prusias, as it is delivered in the fragments of Polybius, (Excerpt. Legat. xcvii. p. 927, 928,) a curious picture of a royal slave.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_570"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_570">42</a> The item of Procopius (Goth. l. iv. c. 35) is evidently the Sarnus.  The text is accused or altered by the rash violence of Cluverius (l. iv. c. 3. p. 1156:) but Camillo Pellegrini of Naples (Discorsi sopra la Campania Felice, p. 330, 331) has proved from old records, that as early as the year 822 that river was called the Dracontio, or Draconcello.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_571"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_571">43</a> Galen (de Method. Medendi, l. v. apud Cluver. l. iv. c. 3, p. 1159, 1160) describes the lofty site, pure air, and rich milk, of Mount Lactarius, whose medicinal benefits were equally known and sought in the time of Symmachus (l. vi. epist. 18) and Cassiodorus, (Var. xi. 10.) Nothing is now left except the name of the town of Lettere.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_572"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_572">44</a> Buat (tom. xi. p. 2, &amp;c.) conveys to his favorite Bavaria this remnant of Goths, who by others are buried in the mountains of Uri, or restored to their native isle of Gothland, (Mascou, Annot. xxi.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_573"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_573">45</a> I leave Scaliger (Animadvers. in Euseb. p. 59) and Salmasius (Exercitat. Plinian. p. 51, 52) to quarrel about the origin of Cumae, the oldest of the Greek colonies in Italy, (Strab. l. v. p. 372, Velleius Paterculus, l. i. c. 4,) already vacant in Juvenal's time, (Satir. iii.,) and now in ruins.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_574"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_574">46</a> Agathias (l. i. c. 21) settles the Sibyl's cave under the wall of Cumae: he agrees with Servius, (ad. l. vi. Aeneid.;) nor can I perceive why their opinion should be rejected by Heyne, the excellent editor of Virgil, (tom. ii. p. 650, 651.) In urbe media secreta religio!  But Cumae was not yet built; and the lines (l. vi. 96, 97) would become ridiculous, if Aeneas were actually in a Greek city.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_575"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_575">47</a> There is some difficulty in connecting the 35th chapter of the fourth book of the Gothic war of Procopius with the first book of the history of Agathias.  We must now relinquish the statesman and soldier, to attend the footsteps of a poet and rhetorician, (l. i. p. 11, l. ii. p. 51, edit. Lonvre.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_576"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_576">48</a> Among the fabulous exploits of Buccelin, he discomfited and slew Belisarius, subdued Italy and Sicily, &amp;c.  See in the Historians of France, Gregory of Tours, (tom. ii. l. iii. c. 32, p. 203,) and Aimoin, (tom. iii. l. ii. de Gestis Francorum, c. 23, p. 59.)</p>

 <p><a name="fn_578"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_578">!_0041</a> Aligern, after the surrender of Cumae, had been sent to Cesent by Narses.  Agathias. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_579"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_579">49</a> Agathias notices their superstition in a philosophic tone, (l. i. p. 18.) At Zug, in Switzerland, idolatry still prevailed in the year 613: St. Columban and St. Gaul were the apostles of that rude country; and the latter founded a hermitage, which has swelled into an ecclesiastical principality and a populous city, the seat of freedom and commerce.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_580"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_580">**_0041</a> A body of Lothaire's troops was defeated near Fano, some were driven down precipices into the sea, others fled to the camp; many prisoners seized the opportunity of making their escape; and the Barbarians lost most of their booty in their precipitate retreat.  Agathias. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_581"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_581">50</a> See the death of Lothaire in Agathias (l. ii. p. 38) and Paul Warnefrid, surnamed Diaconus, (l. ii. c. 3, 775.) The Greek makes him rave and tear his flesh.  He had plundered churches.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_582"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_582">51</a> Pere Daniel (Hist. de la Milice Francoise, tom. i. p. 17 - 21) has exhibited a fanciful representation of this battle, somewhat in the manner of the Chevalier Folard, the once famous editor of Polybius, who fashioned to his own habits and opinions all the military operations of antiquity.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_583"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_583">52</a> Agathias (l. ii. p. 47) has produced a Greek epigram of six lines on this victory of Narses, which a favorably compared to the battles of Marathon and Plataea.  The chief difference is indeed in their consequences - so trivial in the former instance - so permanent and glorious in the latter.       Note: Not in the epigram, but in the previous observations - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_584"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_584">53</a> The Beroia and Brincas of Theophanes or his transcriber (p. 201) must be read or understood Verona and Brixia.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_585"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_585">54</a> (Agathias, l. ii. p. 48.) In the first scene of Richard III. our English poet has beautifully enlarged on this idea, for which, however, he was not indebted to the Byzantine historian.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_586"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_586">55</a> Maffei has proved, (Verona Illustrata. P. i. l. x. p. 257, 289,) against the common opinion, that the dukes of Italy were instituted before the conquest of the Lombards, by Narses himself.  In the Pragmatic Sanction, (No. 23,) Justinian restrains the judices militares.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_587"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_587">56</a> See Paulus Diaconus, liii. c. 2, p. 776.  Menander in (Excerp Legat. p. 133) mentions some risings in Italy by the Franks, and Theophanes (p. 201) hints at some Gothic rebellions.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_588"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_588">57</a> The Pragmatic Sanction of Justinian, which restores and regulates the civil state of Italy, consists of xxvii. articles: it is dated August 15, A.D. 554; is addressed to Narses, V. J. Praepositus Sacri Cubiculi, and to Antiochus, Praefectus Praetorio Italiae; and has been preserved by Julian Antecessor, and in the Corpus Juris Civilis, after the novels and edicts of Justinian, Justin, and Tiberius.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_589"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_589">58</a> A still greater number was consumed by famine in the southern provinces, without the Ionian Gulf.  Acorns were used in the place of bread. Procopius had seen a deserted orphan suckled by a she-goat. Seventeen passengers were lodged, murdered, and eaten, by two women, who were detected and slain by the eighteenth, &amp;c. </p> 
 <p>     Note: Denina considers that greater evil was inflicted upon Italy by the Urocian conquest than by any other invasion.  Reveluz. d' Italia, t. i. l. v. p. 247. - M.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_590"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_590">59</a> Quinta regio Piceni est; quondam uberrimae multitudinis, ccclx. millia Picentium in fidem P. R. venere, (Plin. Hist. Natur. iii. 18.) In the time of Vespasian, this ancient population was already diminished.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_591"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_591">60</a> Perhaps fifteen or sixteen millions.  Procopius (Anecdot. c. 18) computes that Africa lost five millions, that Italy was thrice as extensive, and that the depopulation was in a larger proportion.  But his reckoning is inflamed by passion, and clouded with uncertainty.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_592"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_592">*_0042</a> Zabergan was king of the Cutrigours, a tribe of Huns, who were neither Bulgarians nor Sclavonians. St. Martin, vol. ix. p. 408 - 420. - M</p>
 <p><a name="fn_593"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_593">61</a> In the decay of these military schools, the satire of Procopius (Anecdot. c. 24, Aleman. p. 102, 103) is confirmed and illustrated by Agathias, (l. v. p. 159,) who cannot be rejected as a hostile witness.</p>
 <p><a name="fn_594"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_594">62</a> The distance from Constantinople to Melanthias, Villa Caesariana, (Ammian. Marcellin. xxx. 11,) is variously fixed at 102 or 140 stadia, (Suidas, tom. ii. p. 522, 523.  Agathias, l. v. p. 158,) or xviii. or xix.  miles, (Itineraria, p. 138, 230, 323, 332, and Wesseling's Observations.) The first xii. miles, as far as Rhegium, were paved by Justinian, who built a bridge over a morass or gullet between a lake and the sea, (Procop. de Edif. l. iv. c. 8.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_595"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_595">63</a> The Atyras, (Pompon. Mela, l. ii. c. 2, p. 169, edit. Voss.) At the river's mouth, a town or castle of the same name was fortified by Justinian, (Procop. de Edif. l. iv. c. 2.  Itinerar. p. 570, and Wesseling.)</p>
 <p><a name="fn_596"></a><a href="daf04020.htm#fr_596">64</a> The Bulgarian war, and the last victory of Belisarius, are imperfectly represented in the prolix declamation of Agathias.  (l. 5, p. 154-174,) and the dry Chronicle of Theophanes, (p. 197 198.)</p>
