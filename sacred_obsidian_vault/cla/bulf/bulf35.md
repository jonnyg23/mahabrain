 <h2 align="CENTER">MODERN MONSTERS- THE PHOENIX- BASILISK- UNICORN-</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">-SALAMANDER.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">MODERN MONSTERS.</h3>
 
 <p>THERE is a set of imaginary beings which seem to have been the
 successors of the "Gorgons, Hydras, and Chimeras dire" of the old
 superstitions, and, having no connection with the false gods of
 Paganism, to have continued to enjoy an existence in the popular
 belief after Paganism was superseded by Christianity. They are
 mentioned perhaps by the classical writers, but their chief popularity
 and currency seem to have been in more modern times. We seek our
 accounts of them not so much in the poetry of the ancients as in the
 old natural history books and narrations of travellers. The accounts
 which we are about to give are taken chiefly from the Penny
 Cyclopedia.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE PHOENIX.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Ovid tells the story of the Phoenix as follows: "Most beings
 spring from other individuals; but there is a certain kind which
 reproduces itself. The Assyrians call it the Phoenix. It does not live
 on fruit or flowers, but on frankincense and odoriferous gums. When it
 has lived five hundred years, it builds itself a nest in the
 branches of an oak, or on the top of a palm tree. In this it
 collects cinnamon, and spikenard, and myrrh, and of these 'materials
 builds a pile on which it deposits itself, and dying, breathes out its
 last breath amidst odours. From the body of the parent bird, a young
 Phoenix issues forth, destined to live as long a life as its
 predecessor. When this has grown up and gained sufficient strength, it
 lifts its nest from the tree (its own cradle and its parent's
 sepulchre), and carries it to the city of Heliopolis in Egypt, and
 deposits it in the temple of the Sun."
 </p>
 <p>Such is the account given by a poet. Now let us see that of a
 philosophic historian. Tacitus says, "in the consulship of Paulus
 Fabius (A.D. 34) the miraculous bird known to the world by the name of
 the Phoenix, after disappearing for a series of ages, revisited Egypt.
 It was attended in its flight by a group of various birds, all
 attracted by the novelty, and gazing with wonder at so beautiful an
 appearance." He then gives an account of the bird, not varying
 materially from the preceding, but adding some details. "The first
 care of the young bird as soon as fledged, and able to trust to his
 wings, is to perform the obsequies of his father. But this duty is not
 undertaken rashly. He collects a quantity of myrrh, and to try his
 strength makes frequent excursions with a load on his back. When he
 has gained sufficient confidence in his own vigour, he takes up the
 body of his father and flies with it to the altar of the Sun, where he
 leaves it to be consumed in flames of fragrance." Other writers add
 a few particulars. The myrrh is compacted in the form of an egg, in
 which the dead Phoenix is enclosed. From the mouldering flesh of the
 dead bird a worm springs, and this worm, when grown large, is
 transformed into a bird. Herodotus describes the bird, though he says,
 "I have not seen it myself, except in a picture. Part of his plumage
 is gold-coloured, and part crimson; and he is for the most part very
 much like an eagle in outline and bulk."
 </p>
 <p>The first writer who disclaimed a belief in the existence of the
 Phoenix was Sir Thomas Browne, in his "Vulgar Errors," published in
 1646. He was replied to a few years later by Alexander Ross, who says,
 in answer to the objection of the Phoenix so seldom making his
 appearance, "His instinct teaches him to keep out of the way of the
 tyrant of the creation, man, for if he were to be got at, some wealthy
 glutton would surely devour him, though there were no more in the
 world."
 
 </p>
 <p>Dryden in one of his early poems has this allusion to the Phoenix:
 
 </p>
         "So when the new-born Phoenix first is seen<br>
          Her feathered subjects all adore their queen,<br>
          And while she makes her progress through the East,<br>
          From every grove her numerous train 's increased;<br>
          Each poet of the air her glory sings,<br>
          And round him the pleased audience clap their wings."<br>
 
 <p>Milton, in "Paradise Lost," Book V., compares the angel Raphael
 descending to earth to a Phoenix:
 
 </p>
         "...Down thither, prone in flight<br>
          He speeds, and through the vast ethereal sky<br>
          Sails between worlds and worlds, with steady wing,<br>
          Now on the polar winds, then with quick fan<br>
          Winnows the buxom air; till within soar<br>
          Of towering eagles, to all the fowls he seems<br>
          A Phoenix, gazed by all; as that sole bird<br>
          When, to enshrine his relics in the sun's<br>
          Bright temple, to Egyptian Thebes he flies."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE COCKATRICE, OR BASILISK.</h3>
 
 <p>This animal was called the king of the serpents. In confirmation
 of his royalty, he was said to be endowed with a crest, or comb upon
 the head, constituting a crown. He was supposed to be produced from
 the egg of a cock hatched under toads or serpents. There were
 several species of this animal. One species burned up whatever they
 approached; a second were a kind of wandering Medusa's heads, and
 their look caused an instant horror which was immediately followed
 by death. In Shakespeare's play of "Richard the Third," Lady Anne,
 in answer to Richard's compliment on her eyes, says "Would they were
 basilisk's, to strike thee dead!"
 </p>
 <p>The basilisks were called kings of serpents because all other
 serpents and snakes, behaving like good subjects, and wisely not
 wishing to be burned up or struck dead, fled the moment they heard the
 distant hiss of their king, although they might be in full feed upon
 the most delicious prey, leaving the sole enjoyment of the banquet
 to the royal monster.
 </p>
 <p>The Roman naturalist Pliny thus describes him. "He does not impel
 his body, like other serpents, by a multiplied flexion, but advances
 lofty and upright. He kills the shrubs, not only by contact, but by
 breathing on them, and splits the rocks, such power of evil is there
 in him." It was formerly believed that if killed by a spear from on
 horseback the power of the poison conducted through the weapon
 killed not only the rider, but the horse also. To this Lucan alludes
 in these lines:
 
 </p>
         "What though the Moor the basilisk hath slain,<br>
          And pinned him lifeless to the sandy plain,<br>
          Up through the spear the subtle venom flies,<br>
          The hand imbibes it, and the victor dies."<br>
 
 <p>Such a prodigy was not likely to be passed over in the legends of
 the saints. Accordingly we find it recorded that a certain holy man,
 going to a fountain in the desert, suddenly beheld a basilisk. He
 immediately raised his eyes to heaven, and with a pious appeal to
 the Deity laid the monster dead at his feet.
 </p>
 <p>These wonderful powers of the basilisk are attested by a host of
 learned persons, such as Galen, Avicenna, Scaliger, and others.
 Occasionally one would demur to some part of the tale while he
 admitted the rest. Jonston, a learned physician, sagely remarks, "I
 would scarcely believe that it kills with its look, for who could have
 seen it and lived to tell the story?" The worthy sage was not aware
 that those who went to hunt the basilisk of this sort took with them a
 mirror, which reflected back the deadly glare upon its author, and
 by a kind of poetical justice slew the basilisk with his own weapon.
 </p>
 <p>But what was to attack this terrible and unapproachable monster?
 There is an old saying that "everything has its enemy"- and the
 cockatrice quailed before the weasel. The basilisk might look daggers,
 the weasel cared not, but advanced boldly to the conflict. When
 bitten, the weasel retired for a moment to eat some rue, which was the
 only plant the basilisks could not wither, returned with renewed
 strength and soundness to the charge, and never left the enemy till he
 was stretched dead on the plain. The monster, too, as if conscious
 of the irregular way in which he came into the world, was supposed
 to have a great antipathy to a cock; and well he might, for as soon as
 he heard the cock crow he expired.
 </p>
 <p>The basilisk was of some use after death. Thus we read that its
 carcass was suspended in the temple of Apollo, and in private
 houses, as a sovereign remedy against spiders, and that it was also
 hung up in the temple of Diana, for which reason no swallow ever dared
 enter the sacred place.
 </p>
 <p>The reader will, we apprehend, by this time have had enough of
 absurdities, but still we can imagine his anxiety to know what a
 cockatrice was like. The following is from Aldrovandus, a celebrated
 naturalist of the sixteenth century, whose work on natural history, in
 thirteen folio volumes, contains with much that is valuable a large
 proportion of fables and inutilities. In particular he is so ample
 on the subject of the cock and the bull that from his practice, all
 rambling, gossiping tales of doubtful credibility are called cock
 and bull stories.
 </p>
 <p>Shelley, in his "Ode to Naples," full of the enthusiasm excited by
 the intelligence of the proclamation of a Constitutional Government at
 Naples, in 1820, thus uses an allusion to the basilisk:
 
 </p>
         "What though Cimmerian anarchs dare blaspheme<br>
          Freedom and thee? a new Actaeon's error<br>
          Shall theirs have been,- devoured by their own hounds!<br>
              Be thou like the imperial basilisk,<br>
          Killing thy foe with unapparent wounds!<br>
              Gaze on oppression, till at that dread risk,<br>
              Aghast she pass from the earth's disk.<br>
          Fear not, but gaze,- for freemen mightier grow,<br>
          And slaves more feeble, gazing on their foe."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE UNICORN.</h3>
 
 <p>Pliny, the Roman naturalist, out of whose account of the unicorn
 most of the modern unicorns have been described and figured, records
 it as "a very ferocious beast, similar in the rest of its body to a
 horse, with the head of a deer, the feet of an elephant, the tail of a
 boar, a deep, bellowing voice, and a single black horn, two cubits
 in length, standing out in the middle of its forehead." He adds that
 "it cannot be taken alive"; and some such excuse may have been
 necessary in those days for not producing the living animal upon the
 arena of the amphitheatre.
 </p>
 <p>The unicorn seems to have been a sad puzzle to the hunters, who
 hardly knew how to come at so valuable a piece of game. Some described
 the horn as movable at the will of the animal, a kind of small
 sword, in short, with which no hunter who was not exceedingly
 cunning in fence could have a chance. Others maintained that all the
 animal's strength lay in its horn, and that when hard pressed in
 pursuit, it would throw itself from the pinnacle of the highest
 rocks horn foremost, so as to pitch upon it, and then quietly march
 off not a whit the worse for its fall.
 </p>
 <p>But it seems they found out how to circumvent the poor unicorn at
 last. They discovered that it was a great lover of purity and
 innocence, so they took the field with a young virgin, who was
 placed in the unsuspecting admirer's way. When the unicorn spied
 her, he approached with all reverence, crouched beside her, and laying
 his head in her lap, fell asleep. The treacherous virgin then gave a
 signal, and the hunters made in and captured the simple beast.
 </p>
 <p>Modern zoologists, disgusted as they well may be with such fables as
 these, disbelieved generally the existence of the unicorn. Yet there
 are animals bearing on their heads a bony protuberance more or less
 like a horn, which may have given rise to the story. The rhinoceros
 horn, as it is called, is such a protuberance, though it does not
 exceed a few inches in height, and is far from agreeing with the
 descriptions of the horn of the unicorn. The nearest approach to a
 horn in the middle of the forehead is exhibited in the bony
 protuberance on the forehead of the giraffe; but this also is short
 and blunt, and is not the only horn of the animal, but a third horn,
 standing in front of the two others. In fine, though it would be
 presumptuous to deny the existence of a one-horned quadruped other
 than the rhinoceros, it may be safely stated that the insertion of a
 long and solid horn in the living forehead of a horse-like or
 deer-like animal is as near an impossibility as anything can be.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE SALAMANDER.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The following is from the "Life of Benvenuto Cellini," an Italian
 artist of the sixteenth century, written by himself: "When I was about
 five years of age, my father, happening to be in a little room in
 which they had been washing, and where there was a good fire of oak
 burning, looked into the flames and saw a little animal resembling a
 lizard, which could live in the hottest part of that element.
 Instantly perceiving what it was, he called for my sister and me,
 and after he had shown us the creature, he gave me a box on the ear. I
 fell a-crying, while he, soothing me with caresses, spoke these words:
 'My dear child, I do not give you that blow for any fault you have
 committed, but that you may recollect that the little creature you see
 in the fire is a salamander; such a one as never was beheld before
 to my knowledge.' So saying he embraced me, and gave me some money."
 </p>
 <p>It seems unreasonable to doubt a story of which Signor Cellini was
 both an eye and ear witness. Add to which the authority of numerous
 sage philosophers, at the head of whom are Aristotle and Pliny,
 affirms this power of the salamander. According to them, the animal
 not only resists fire, but extinguishes it, and when he sees the flame
 charges it as an enemy which he well knows how to vanquish.
 </p>
 <p>That the skin of an animal which could resist the action of fire
 should be considered proof against that element is not to be
 wondered at. We accordingly find that a cloth made of the skin of
 salamanders (for there really is such an animal, a kind of lizard) was
 incombustible, and very valuable, for wrapping up such articles as
 were too precious to be intrusted to any other envelopes. These
 fire-proof cloths were actually produced, said to be made of
 salamander's wool, though the knowing ones detected that the substance
 of which they were composed was asbestos, a mineral, which is in
 fine filaments capable of being woven into a flexible cloth.
 </p>
 <p>The foundation of the above fables is supposed to be the fact that
 the salamander really does secrete from the pores of his body a
 milky juice, which when he is irritated is produced in considerable
 quantity, and would doubtless, for a few moments, defend the body from
 fire. Then it is a hibernating animal, and in winter retires to some
 hollow tree or other cavity, where it coils itself up and remains in a
 torpid state till the spring again calls it forth. It may therefore
 sometimes be carried with the fuel to the fire, and wake up only
 time enough to put forth all its faculties for its defence. Its
 viscous juice would do good service, and all who profess to have
 seen it, acknowledge that it got out of the fire as fast as its legs
 could carry it; indeed, too fast for them ever to make prize of one,
 except in one instance, and in that one the animal's feet and some
 parts of its body were badly burned.
 
 </p>
 <p>Dr. Young, in the "Night Thoughts," with more quaintness than good
 taste, compares the sceptic who can remain unmoved in the
 contemplation of the starry heavens to a salamander unwarmed in the
 fire:
 
 </p>
         "An undevout astronomer is mad!<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">.     .     .     .     .     .     .</h3>
 
         "O, what a genius must inform the skies!<br>
          And is Lorenzo's salamander-heart<br>
          Cold and untouched amid these sacred fires?"<br>
