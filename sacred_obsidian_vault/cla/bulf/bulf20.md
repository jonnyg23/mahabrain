 <h2 align="CENTER">BACCHUS- ARIADNE.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">BACCHUS.</h3>
 
 <p>BACCHUS was the son of Jupiter and Semele. Juno, to gratify her
 resentment against Semele, contrived a plan for her destruction.
 Assuming the form of Beroe, her aged nurse, she insinuated doubts
 whether it was indeed Jove himself who came as a lover. Heaving a
 sigh, she said, "I hope it will turn out so, but I can't help being
 afraid. People are not always what they pretend to be. If he is indeed
 Jove, make him give some proof of it. Ask him to come arrayed in all
 his splendours, such as he wears in heaven. That will put the matter
 beyond a doubt." Semele was persuaded to try the experiment. She
 asks a favour, without naming what it is. Jove gives his promise,
 and confirms it with the irrevocable oath, attesting the river Styx,
 terrible to the gods themselves. Then she made known her request.
 The god would have stopped her as she spake, but she was too quick for
 him. The words escaped, and he could neither unsay his promise nor her
 request. In deep distress he left her and returned to the upper
 regions. There he clothed himself in his splendours, not putting on
 all his terrors, as when he overthrew the giants, but what is known
 among the gods as his lesser panoply. Arrayed in this, he entered
 the chamber of Semele. Her mortal frame could not endure the
 splendours of the immortal radiance. She was consumed to ashes.
 </p>
 <p>Jove took the infant Bacchus and gave him in charge to the Nysaean
 nymphs, who nourished his infancy and childhood, and for their care
 were rewarded by Jupiter by being placed, as the Hyades, among the
 stars. When Bacchus grew up he discovered the culture of the vine
 and the mode of extracting its precious juice; but Juno struck him
 with madness, and drove him forth a wanderer through various parts
 of the earth. In Phrygia the goddess Rhea cured him and taught him her
 religious rites, and he set out on a progress through Asia, teaching
 the people the cultivation of the vine. The most famous part of his
 wanderings is his expedition to India, which is said to have lasted
 several years. Returning in triumph, he undertook to introduce his
 worship into Greece, but was opposed by some princes, who dreaded
 its introduction on account of the disorder and madness it brought
 with it.
 </p>
 <p>As he approached his native city Thebes, Pentheus the king, who
 had no respect for the new worship, forbade its rites to be performed.
 But when it was known that Bacchus was advancing, men and women, but
 chiefly the latter, young and old, poured forth to meet him and to
 join his triumphal march.
 
 </p>
 <p>Mr. Longfellow in his "Drinking Song" thus describes the march of
 Bacchus:
 
 </p>
             "Fauns with youthful Bacchus follow;<br>
                Ivy crowns that brow, supernal<br>
              As the forehead of Apollo,<br>
                And possessing youth eternal.<br>
 
             "Round about him fair Bacchantes,<br>
                Bearing cymbals, flutes and thyrses,<br>
              Wild from Naxian groves of Zante's<br>
                Vineyards, sing delirious verses."<br>
 
 <p>It was in vain Pentheus remonstrated, commanded and threatened.
 "Go," said he to his attendants, "seize this vagabond leader of the
 rout and bring him to me. I will soon make him confess his false claim
 of heavenly parentage and renounce his counterfeit worship." It was in
 vain his nearest friends and wisest counsellors remonstrated and
 begged him not to oppose the god. Their remonstrances only made him
 more violent.
 </p>
 <p>But now the attendants returned whom he had despatched to seize
 Bacchus. They had been driven away by the Bacchanals, but had
 succeeded in taking one of them prisoner, whom, with his hands tied
 behind him, they brought before the king. Pentheus, beholding him with
 wrathful countenance, said "Fellow! you shall speedily be put to
 death, that your fate may be a warning to others; but though I
 grudge the delay of your punishment, speak, tell us who you are, and
 what are these new rites you presume to celebrate."
 </p>
 <p>The prisoner, unterrified, responded, "My name is Acetes; my country
 is Maeonia; my parents were poor people, who had no fields or flocks
 to leave me, but they left me their fishing rods and nets and their
 fisherman's trade. This I followed for some time, till growing weary
 of remaining in one place, I learned the pilot's art and how to
 guide my course by the stars. It happened as I was sailing for Delos
 we touched at the island of Dia and went ashore. Next morning I sent
 the men for fresh water, and myself mounted the hill to observe the
 wind; when my men returned bringing with them a prize, as they
 thought, a boy of delicate appearance, whom they had found asleep.
 They judged he was a noble youth, perhaps a king's son, and they might
 get a liberal ransom for him. I observed his dress, his walk, his
 face, There was something in them which I felt sure was more than
 mortal. I said to my men, 'What god there is concealed in that form
 I know not, but some one there certainly is. Pardon us, gentle
 deity, for the violence we have done you, and give success to our
 undertakings.' Dictys, one of my best hands for climbing the mast
 and coming down by the ropes, and Melanthus, my steersman, and
 Epopeus, the leader of the sailor's cry, one and all exclaimed, 'Spare
 your prayers for us.' So blind is the lust of gain! When they
 proceeded to put him on board I resisted them. 'This ship shall not be
 profaned by such impiety,' said I. 'I have a greater share in her than
 any of you.' But Lycabas, a turbulent fellow, seized me by the
 throat and attempted to throw my overboard, and I scarcely saved
 myself by clinging to the ropes. The rest approved the deed.
 </p>
 <p>"Then Bacchus (for it was indeed he), as if shaking off his
 drowsiness, exclaimed, 'What are you doing with me? What is this
 fighting about? Who brought me here? Where are you going to carry me?'
 One of them replied, 'Fear nothing; tell us where you wish to go and
 we will take you there.' 'Naxos is my home,' said Bacchus; 'take me
 there and you shall be well rewarded.' They promised so to do, and
 told me to pilot the ship to Naxos. Naxos lay to the right, and I
 was trimming the sails to carry us there, when some by signs and
 others by whispers signified to me their will that I should sail in
 the opposite direction, and take the boy to Egypt to sell him for a
 slave, I was confounded and said, 'Let some one else pilot the
 ship;' withdrawing myself from any further agency in their wickedness.
 They cursed me, and one of them, exclaiming, 'Don't flatter yourself
 that we depend on you for our safety,' took my place as pilot, and
 bore away from Naxos.
 </p>
 <p>"Then the god, pretending that he had just become aware of their
 treachery, looked out over the sea and said in a voice of weeping,
 'Sailors, these are not the shores you promised to take me to;
 yonder island is not my home. What have I done that you should treat
 me so? It is small glory you will gain by cheating a poor boy.' I wept
 to hear him, but the crew laughed at both of us, and sped the vessel
 fast over the sea. All at once- strange as it may seem, it is true,-
 the vessel stopped, in the mid sea, as fast as if it was fixed on
 the ground. The men, astonished, pulled at their oars, and spread more
 sail, trying to make progress by the aid of both, but all in vain. Ivy
 twined round the oars and hindered their motion, and clung to the
 sails, with heavy clusters of berries. A vine, laden with grapes,
 ran up the mast, and along the sides of the vessel. The sound of
 flutes was heard and the odour of fragrant wine spread all around. The
 god himself had a chaplet of vine leaves, and bore in his hand a spear
 wreathed with ivy. Tigers crouched at his feet, and forms of lynxes
 and spotted panthers played around him. The men were seized with
 terror or madness; some leaped overboard; others preparing to do the
 same beheld their companions in the water undergoing a change, their
 bodies becoming flattened and ending in a crooked tail. One exclaimed,
 'What miracle is this!' and as he spoke his mouth widened, his
 nostrils expanded, and scales covered all his body. Another,
 endeavouring to pull the oar, felt his hands shrink up and presently
 to be no longer hands but fins; another, trying to raise his arms to a
 rope, found he had no arms, and curving his mutilated body jumped into
 the sea. What had been his legs became the two ends of a
 crescent-shaped tail. The whole crew became dolphins and swam about
 the ship, now upon the surface, now under it, scattering the spray,
 and spouting the water from their broad nostrils. Of twenty men I
 alone was left. Trembling with fear, the god cheered me. 'Fear not,'
 said he; 'steer towards Naxos.' I obeyed, and when we arrived there, I
 kindled the altars and celebrated the sacred rites of Bacchus."
 </p>
 <p>Pentheus here exclaimed, "We have wasted time enough on this silly
 story. Take him away and have him executed without delay." Acetes
 was led away by the attendants and shut up fast in prison; but while
 they were getting ready the instruments of execution the prison
 doors came open of their own accord and the chains fell from his
 limbs, and when they looked for him he was nowhere to be found.
 </p>
 <p>Pentheus would take no warning, but instead of sending others,
 determined to go himself to the scene of the solemnities. The mountain
 Citheron was all alive with worshippers, and the cries of the
 Bacchanals resounded on every side. The noise roused the anger of
 Pentheus as the sound of a trumpet does the fire of a war-horse. He
 penetrated through the wood and reached an open space where the
 chief scene of the orgies met his eyes. At the same moment the women
 saw him; and first among them his own mother, Agave, blinded by the
 god, cried out, "See there the wild boar, the hugest monster that
 prowls in these woods! Come on, sisters! I will be the first to strike
 the wild boar." The whole band rushed upon him, and while he now talks
 less arrogantly, now excuses himself, and now confesses his crime
 and implores pardon, they press upon him and wound him. In vain he
 cries to his aunts to protect him from his mother. Autonoe seized
 one arm, Ino the other, and between them he was torn to pieces,
 while his mother shouted, "Victory! Victory! we have done it; the
 glory is ours!"
 </p>
 <p>So the worship of Bacchus was established in Greece.
 
 </p>
 <p>There is an allusion to the story of Bacchus and the mariners in
 Milton's "Comus," at line 46. The story of Circe will be found in
 Chapter XXIX.
 
 </p>
           "Bacchus that first from out the purple grapes<br>
            Crushed the sweet poison of misused wine,<br>
            After the Tuscan mariners transformed,<br>
            Coasting the Tyrrhene shore as the winds listed<br>
            On Circe's island fell; (who knows not Circe,<br>
            The daughter of the Sun? whose charmed cup<br>
            Whoever tasted lost his upright shape,<br>
            And downward fen into a grovelling swine.)"<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">ARIADNE.</h3>
 
 <p>We have seen in the story of Theseus how Ariadne, the daughter of
 King Minos, after helping Theseus to escape from the labyrinth, was
 carried by him to the island of Naxos and was left there asleep, while
 the ungrateful Theseus pursued his way home without her. Ariadne, on
 waking and finding herself deserted, abandoned herself to grief. But
 Venus took pity on her, and consoled her with the promise that she
 should have an immortal lover, instead of the mortal one she had lost.
 </p>
 <p>The island where Ariadne was left was the favourite island of
 Bacchus, the same that he wished the Tyrrhenian mariners to carry
 him to, when they so treacherously attempted to make prize of him.
 As Ariadne sat lamenting her fate, Bacchus found her, consoled her,
 and made her his wife. As a marriage present he gave her a golden
 crown, enriched with gems, and when she died, he took her crown and
 threw it up into the sky. As it mounted the gems grew brighter and
 were turned into stars, and preserving its form Ariadne's crown
 remains fixed in the heavens as a constellation, between the
 kneeling Hercules and the man who holds the serpent.
 
 </p>
 <p>Spenser alludes to Ariadne's crown, though he has made some mistakes
 in his mythology. It was at the wedding of Pirithous, and not Theseus,
 that the Centaurs and Lapithae quarrelled.
 
 </p>
             "Look how the crown which Ariadne wore<br>
              Upon her ivory forehead that same day<br>
              That Theseus her unto his bridal bore,<br>
              Then the bold Centaurs made that bloody fray<br>
              With the fierce Lapiths which did them dismay;<br>
              Being now placed in the firmament,<br>
              Through the bright heaven doth her beams display,<br>
              And is unto the stars an ornament,<br>
              Which round about her move in order excellent."<br>
