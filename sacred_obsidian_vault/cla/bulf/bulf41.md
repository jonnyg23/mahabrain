 <h1 align="CENTER">CHAPTER XLII.</h1>
 <h2 align="CENTER">BEOWULF.</h2>
 
 <p>ALTHOUGH the manuscript which contains the epic of Beowulf was
 written about 1000 A.D., the poem itself was known and had been
 elaborated upon for centuries by minstrels who recited the heroic
 exploits of the son of Ecgtheow and nephew of Hygelac, King of the
 Geats, whose kingdom was what is now Southern Sweden.
 </p>
 <p>In his boyhood Beowulf gave evidence of the great feats of
 strength and courage which in manhood made him the deliverer of
 Hrothgar, King of Denmark, from the monster, Grendel, and later in his
 own kingdom from the fiery dragon which dealt Beowulf a mortal blow.
 </p>
 <p>Beowulf's first renown followed his conquest of many sea-monsters
 while he swam for seven days and nights before he came to the
 country of the Finns. Helping to defend the land of the Hetware, he
 killed many of the enemy and again showed his prowess as a swimmer
 by bringing to his ship the armor of thirty of his slain pursuers.
 Offered the crown of his native land, Beowulf, just entering
 manhood, refused it in favor of Heardred, the young son of the
 queen. Instead, he acted as guardian and counsellor until the boy-king
 grew old enough to rule alone.
 </p>
 <p>For twelve years, Hrothgar, King of Denmark, suffered while his
 kingdom was being ravaged by a devouring monster, named Grendel.
 This Grendel bore a charmed life against all weapons forged by man. He
 lived in the wastelands and nightly prowled out to visit the hall of
 Hrothgar, carrying off and slaughtering many of the guests.
 </p>
 <p>Beowulf, hearing from mariners of Grendel's murderous visits, sailed
 from Geatland with fourteen stalwart companions to render Hrothgar the
 help of his great strength. Landing on the Danish coast, Beowulf was
 challenged as a spy. He persuaded the coastguards to let him pass, and
 he was received and feasted by King Hrothgar. When the king and his
 court retired for the night, Beowulf and his companions were left
 alone in the hall. All but Beowulf fell asleep. Grendel entered.
 With a stroke he killed one of Beowulf's sleeping men, but Beowulf,
 unarmed, wrestled with the monster and by dint of his great strength
 managed to tear Grendel's arm out at the shoulder. Grendel, mortally
 wounded, retreated, leaving a bloody trail from the hall to his lair.
 </p>
 <p>All fear of another attack by Grendel allayed. the Danes returned to
 the hall, and Beowulf and his companions were sheltered elsewhere.
 Grendel's mother came to avenge the fatal injury to her monster son
 and carried off a Danish nobleman and Grendel's torn-off paw.
 Following the blood trail, Beowulf went forth to despatch the
 mother. Armed with his sword, Hrunting, he came to the water's edge.
 He plunged in and swam to a chamber under the sea. There he fought
 with Grendel's mother, killing her with an old sword he found in the
 sea cavern. Nearby was Grendel's body. Beowulf cut off its head and
 brought it back as a trophy to King Hrothgar. Great was the
 rejoicing in the hall and greater was Beowulf's welcome when he
 returned to Geatland, where he was given great estates and many high
 honors.
 </p>
 <p>Shortly afterward, Heardred, the boy-king, was killed in the war
 with the Swedes. Beowulf succeeded him to the throne.
 </p>
 <p>For fifty years Beowulf ruled his people in peace and serenity. Then
 suddenly a dragon, furious at having his treasure stolen from his
 hoard in a burial mound, began to ravage Beowulf's kingdom. Like
 Grendel, this monster left its den at night on its errand of murder
 and pillage.
 </p>
 <p>Beowulf, now an aged monarch, resolved to do battle, unaided, with
 the dragon. He approached the entrance to its den, whence boiling
 steam issued forth. Undaunted, Beowulf strode forward shouting his
 defiance. The dragon came out, sputtering flames from its mouth. The
 monster rushed upon Beowulf with all its fury and almost crushed him
 in its first charge. So fearful grew the struggle that all but one
 of Beowulf's men deserted and fled for their lives. Wiglaf remained to
 help his aged monarch. Another rush of the dragon shattered
 Beowulf's sword and the monster's fangs sunk into Beowulf's neck.
 Wiglaf, rushing into the struggle, helped the dying Beowulf to kill
 the dragon.
 </p>
 <p>Before his death, Beowulf named Wiglaf his successor to the throne
 of Geatland and ordered that his own ashes be placed in a memorial
 shrine at the top of a high cliff commanding the sea. Beowulf's body
 was burned on a vast funeral pyre, while twelve Geats rode around
 the mound singing their sorrow and their praise for the good and great
 man, Beowulf.
