 <h2 align="CENTER">PROMETHEUS AND PANDORA.</h2>
 
 
 <p>THE creation of the world is a problem naturally fitted to excite
 the liveliest interest of man, its inhabitant. The ancient pagans, not
 having the information on the subject which we derive from the pages
 of Scripture, had their own way of telling the story, which is as
 follows:
 </p>
 <p>Before earth and sea and heaven were created, all things wore one
 aspect, to which we give the name of Chaos- a confused and shapeless
 mass, nothing but dead weight, in which, however, slumbered the
 seeds of things. Earth, sea, and air were all mixed up together; so
 the earth was not solid, the sea was not fluid, and the air was not
 transparent. God and Nature at last interposed, and put an end to this
 discord, separating earth from sea, and heaven from both. The fiery
 part, being the lightest, sprang up, and formed the skies; the air was
 next in weight and place. The earth, being heavier, sank below; and
 the water took the lowest place, and buoyed up the earth.
 </p>
 <p>Here some god- it is not known which- gave his good offices in
 arranging and disposing the earth. He appointed rivers and bays
 their places, raised mountains, scooped out valleys, distributed
 woods, fountains, fertile fields. and stony plains. The air being
 cleared, the stars began to appear, fishes took possession of the sea,
 birds of the air, and four-footed beasts of the land.
 </p>
 <p>But a nobler animal was wanted, and Man was made. It is not known
 whether the creator made him of divine materials, or whether in the
 earth, so lately separated from heaven, there lurked still some
 heavenly seeds. Prometheus took some of this earth, and kneading it up
 with water, made man in the image of the gods. He gave him an
 upright stature, so that while all other animals turn their faces
 downward, and look to the earth, he raises his to heaven, and gazes on
 the stars.
 </p>
 <p>Prometheus was one of the Titans, a gigantic race, who inhabited the
 earth before the creation of man. To him and his brother Epimetheus
 was committed the office of making man, and providing him and all
 other animals with the faculties necessary for their preservation.
 Epimetheus undertook to do this, and Prometheus was to overlook his
 work, when it was done. Epimetheus accordingly proceeded to bestow
 upon the different animals the various gifts of courage, strength,
 swiftness, sagacity; wings to one, claws to another, a shelly covering
 to a third, etc. But when man came to be provided for, who was to be
 superior to all other animals, Epimetheus had been so prodigal of
 his resources that he had nothing left to bestow upon him. In his
 perplexity he resorted to his brother Prometheus, who, with the aid of
 Minerva, went up to heaven, and lighted his torch at the chariot of
 the sun. and brought down fire to man. With this gift man was more
 than a match for all other animals. It enabled him to make weapons
 wherewith to subdue them; tools with which to cultivate the earth;
 to warm his dwelling, so as to be comparatively independent of
 climate; and finally to introduce the arts and to coin money, the
 means of trade and commerce.
 </p>
 <p>Woman was not yet made. The story (absurd enough!) is that Jupiter
 made her, and sent her to Prometheus and his brother, to punish them
 for their presumption in stealing fire from heaven; and man, for
 accepting the gift. The first woman was named Pandora. She was made in
 heaven, every god contributing something to perfect her. Venus gave
 her beauty, Mercury persuasion, Apollo music, etc. Thus equipped,
 she was conveyed to earth, and presented to Epimetheus, who gladly
 accepted her, though cautioned by his brother to beware of Jupiter and
 his gifts. Epimetheus had in his house a jar, in which were kept
 certain noxious articles for which, in fitting man for his new
 abode, he had had no occasion. Pandora was seized with an eager
 curiosity to know what this jar contained; and one day she slipped off
 the cover and looked in. Forthwith there escaped a multitude of
 plagues for hapless man,- such as gout, rheumatism, and colic for
 his body, and envy, spite, and revenge for his mind,- and scattered
 themselves far and wide. Pandora hastened to replace the lid! but,
 alas! the whole contents of the jar had escaped, one thing only
 excepted, which lay at the bottom, and that was hope. So we see at
 this day, whatever evils are abroad, hope never entirely leaves us;
 and while we have that, no amount of other ills can make us completely
 wretched.
 </p>
 <p>Another story is that Pandora was sent in good faith, by Jupiter, to
 bless man; that she was furnished with a box containing her marriage
 presents, into which every god had put some blessing, She opened the
 box incautiously, and the blessings all escaped, hope only excepted.
 This story seems more probable than the former; for how could hope, so
 precious a jewel as it is, have been kept in a jar full of all
 manner of evils, as in the former statement?
 </p>
 <p>The world being thus furnished with inhabitants, the first age was
 an age of innocence and happiness, called the Golden Age. Truth and
 right prevailed, though not enforced by law, nor was there any
 magistrate to threaten or punish. The forest had not yet been robbed
 of its trees to furnish timbers for vessels, nor had men built
 fortifications round their towns. There were no such things as swords,
 spears, or helmets. The earth brought forth all things necessary for
 man, without his labour in ploughing or sowing, Perpetual spring
 reigned, flowers sprang up without seed, the rivers flowed with milk
 and wine, and yellow honey distilled from the oaks.
 </p>
 <p>Then succeeded the Silver Age, inferior to the golden, but better
 than that of brass. Jupiter shortened the spring, and divided the year
 into seasons. Then, first, men had to endure the extremes of heat
 and cold, and houses became necessary. Caves were the first dwellings,
 and leafy coverts of the woods, and huts woven of twigs. Crops would
 no longer grow without planting. The farmer was obliged to sow the
 seed, and the toiling ox to draw the plough.
 </p>
 <p>Next came the Brazen Age, more savage of temper, and readier to
 the strife of arms, yet not altogether wicked. The hardest and worst
 was the Iron Age. Crime burst in like a flood; modesty, truth, and
 honour fled. In their places came fraud and cunning, violence, and the
 wicked love of gain. Then seamen spread sails to the wind, and the
 trees were torn from the mountains to serve for keels to ships, and
 vex the face of the ocean. The earth, which till now had been
 cultivated in common, began to be divided off into possessions. Men
 were not satisfied with what the surface produced, but must dig into
 its bowels, and draw forth from thence the ores of metals. Mischievous
 iron, and more mischievous gold, were produced. War sprang up, using
 both as weapons; the guest was not safe in his friend's house; and
 sons-in-law and fathers-in-law, brothers and sisters, husbands and
 wives, could not trust one another. Sons wished their fathers dead,
 that they might come to the inheritance; family love lay prostrate.
 The earth was wet with slaughter, and the gods abandoned it, one by
 one, till Astraea* alone was left, and finally she also took her
 departure.
 
 </p>
 <p>* The goddess of innocence and purity. After leaving earth, she
 was placed among the stars, where she became the constellation
 Virgo- the Virgin. Themis (Justice) was the mother of Astraea. She
 is represented as holding aloft a pair of scales, in which she
 weighs the claims of opposing parties.
 </p>
 <p>It was a favourite idea of the old poets that these goddesses
 would one day return, and bring back the Golden Age. Even in a
 Christian hymn, the "Messiah" of Pope, this idea occurs:
 
 </p>
         "All crimes shall cease, and ancient fraud shall fail,<br>
          Returning Justice lift aloft her scale,<br>
          Peace o'er the world her olive wand extend,<br>
          And white-robed Innocence from heaven descend."<br>
 
 <p>See, also, Milton's "Hymn on the Nativity," stanzas xiv. and xv.
 
 </p>
 <p>Jupiter, seeing this state of things, burned with anger. He summoned
 the gods to council. They obeyed the call, and took the road to the
 palace of heaven. The road, which any one may see in a clear night,
 stretches across the face of the sky, and is called the Milky Way.
 Along the road stand the palaces of the illustrious gods; the common
 people of the skies live apart, on either side. Jupiter addressed
 the assembly. He set forth the frightful condition of things on the
 earth, and closed by announcing his intention to destroy the whole
 of its inhabitants, and provide a new race, unlike the first, who
 would be more worthy of life, and much better worshippers of the gods.
 So saying he took a thunderbolt, and was about to launch it at the
 world, and destroy it by burning; but recollecting the danger that
 such a conflagration might set heaven itself on fire, he changed his
 plan, and resolved to drown it. The north wind, which scatters the
 clouds, was chained up; the south was sent out, and soon covered all
 the face of heaven with a cloak of pitchy darkness. The clouds, driven
 together, resound with a crash; torrents of rain fall; the crops are
 laid low; the year's labour of the husbandman perishes in an hour.
 Jupiter, not satisfied with his own waters, calls on his brother
 Neptune to aid him with his. He lets loose the rivers, and pours
 them over the land. At the same time, he heaves the land with an
 earthquake, and brings in the reflux of the ocean over the shores.
 Flocks, herds, men, and houses are swept away, and temples, with their
 sacred enclosures, profaned. If any edifice remained standing, it
 was overwhelmed, and its turrets lay hid beneath the waves. Now all
 was sea, sea without shore. Here and there an individual remained on a
 projecting hilltop, and a few, in boats, pulled the oar where they had
 lately driven the plough. The fishes swim among the tree-tops; the
 anchor is let down into a garden. Where the graceful lambs played
 but now. unwieldy sea calves gambol. The wolf swims among the sheep,
 the yellow lions and tigers struggle in the water. The strength of the
 wild boar serves him not, nor his swiftness the stag. The birds fall
 with weary win, into the water, having found no land for a
 resting-place. Those living beings whom the water spared fell a prey
 to hunger.
 </p>
 <p>Parnassus alone, of all the mountains, overtopped the waves; and
 there Deucalion, and his wife Pyrrha, of the race of Prometheus, found
 refuge- he a just man, and she a faithful worshipper of the gods.
 Jupiter, when he saw none left alive but this pair, and remembered
 their harmless lives and pious demeanour, ordered the north winds to
 drive away the clouds, and disclose the skies to earth, and earth to
 the skies. Neptune also directed Triton to blow on his shell, and
 sound a retreat to the waters. The waters obeyed, and the sea returned
 to its shores, and the rivers to their channels. Then Deucalion thus
 addressed Pyrrha: "O wife, only surviving woman, joined to me first by
 the ties of kindred and marriage, and now by a common danger, would
 that we possessed the power of our ancestor Prometheus, and could
 renew the race as he at first made it! But as we cannot, let us seek
 yonder temple, and inquire of the gods what remains for us to do."
 They entered the temple, deformed as it was with slime, and approached
 the altar, where no fire burned. There they fell prostrate on the
 earth, and prayed the goddess to inform them how they might retrieve
 their miserable affairs. The oracle answered, "Depart from the
 temple with head veiled and garments unbound, and cast behind you
 the bones of your mother." They heard the words with astonishment.
 Pyrrha first broke silence: "We cannot obey; we dare not profane the
 remains of our parents." They sought the thickest shades of the
 wood, and revolved the oracle in their minds. At length Deucalion
 spoke: "Either my sagacity deceives me, or the command is one we may
 obey without impiety. The earth is the great parent of all; the stones
 are her bones; these we may cast behind us; and I think this is what
 the oracle means. At least, it will do no harm to try." They veiled
 their faces, unbound their garments, and picked up stones, and cast
 them behind them. The stones (wonderful to relate) began to grow soft,
 and assume shape. By degrees, they put on a rude resemblance to the
 human form, like a block half finished in the hands of the sculptor.
 The moisture and slime that were about them became flesh; the stony
 part became bones; the veins remained veins, retaining their name,
 only changing their use. Those thrown by the hand of the man became
 men, and those by the woman became women. It was a hard race, and well
 adapted to labour, as we find ourselves to be at this day, giving
 plain indications of our origin.
 </p>
 <p>The comparison of Eve to Pandora is too obvious to have escaped
 Milton, who introduces it in Book IV. of "Paradise Lost":
 
 </p>
           "More lovely than Pandora, whom the gods<br>
            Endowed with all their gifts; and O, too like<br>
            In sad event, when to the unwiser son<br>
            Of Japhet brought by Hermes, she insnared<br>
            Mankind with her fair looks, to be avenged<br>
            On him who had stole Jove's authentic fire."<br>
 
 <p>Prometheus and Epimetheus were sons of Iapetus, which Milton changes
 to Japhet.
 </p>
 <p>Prometheus has been a favourite subject with the poets. He is
 represented as the friend of mankind, who interposed in their behalf
 when Jove was incensed against them, and who taught them
 civilization and the arts. But as, in so doing, he transgressed the
 will of Jupiter, he drew down on himself the anger of the ruler of
 gods and men. Jupiter had him chained to a rock on Mount Caucasus,
 where a vulture preyed on his liver, which was renewed as fast as
 devoured. This state of torment might have been brought to an end at
 any time by Prometheus, if he had been willing, to submit to his
 oppressor; for he possessed a secret which involved the stability of
 Jove's throne, and if he would have revealed it, he might have been at
 once taken into favour. But that he disdained to do. He has
 therefore become the symbol of magnanimous endurance of unmerited
 suffering, and strength of will resisting oppression.
 </p>
 <p>Byron and Shelley have both treated this theme. The following are
 Byron's lines:
 
 </p>
             "Titan! to whose immortal eyes<br>
                The sufferings of mortality,<br>
                Seen in their sad reality,<br>
              Were not as things that gods despise;<br>
              What was thy pity's recompense?<br>
              A silent suffering, and intense;<br>
              The rock, the vulture, and the chain;<br>
              All that the proud can feel of pain;<br>
              The agony they do not show;<br>
              The suffocating sense of woe.<br>
 
             "Thy godlike crime was to be kind;<br>
                To render with thy precepts less<br>
                The sum of human wretchedness,<br>
              And strengthen man with his own mind.<br>
                And, baffled as thou wert from high,<br>
                Still, in thy patient energy<br>
              In the endurance and repulse<br>
                Of thine impenetrable spirit,<br>
              Which earth and heaven could not convulse,<br>
                A mighty lesson we inherit."<br>
 
 <p>Byron also employs the same allusion, in his "Ode to Napoleon
 Bonaparte":
 
 </p>
             "Or, like the thief of fire from heaven,<br>
                Wilt thou withstand the shock?<br>
              And share with him- the unforgiven-<br>
                His vulture and his rock?"<br>
