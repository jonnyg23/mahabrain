 <h3 align="CENTER">WATER DEITIES- THE CAMENAE- THE WINDS.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE RURAL DEITIES.</h3>
 
 <p>PAN, the god of woods and fields, of flocks and shepherds, dwelt
 in grottos, wandered on the mountains and in valleys, and amused
 himself with the chase or in leading the dances of the nymphs. He
 was fond of music, and was, as we have seen, the inventor of the
 syrinx, or shepherd's pipe, which he himself played in a masterly
 manner. Pan, like other gods who dwelt in forests, was dreaded by
 those whose occupations caused them to pass through the woods by
 night, for the gloom and loneliness of such scenes dispose the mind to
 superstitious fears. Hence sudden fright without any visible cause was
 ascribed to Pan, and called a Panic terror.
 </p>
 <p>As the name of the god signifies all, Pan came to be considered a
 symbol of the universe and personification of Nature; and later
 still to be regarded as a representative of all the gods and of
 heathenism itself.
 </p>
 <p>Sylvanus and Faunus were Latin divinities, whose characteristics are
 so nearly the same as those of Pan that we may safely consider them as
 the same personage under different names.
 </p>
 <p>The wood-nymphs, Pan's partners in the dance, were but one class
 of nymphs. There were besides them the Naiads, who presided over
 brooks and fountains, the Oreads, nymphs of mountains and grottos, and
 the Nereids, sea-nymphs. The three last named were immortal, but the
 wood-nymphs, called Dryads or Hamadryads, were believed to perish with
 the trees which had been their abode and with which they had come into
 existence. It was therefore an impious act wantonly to destroy a tree,
 and in some aggravated cases was severely punished, as in the instance
 of Erisichthon, which we are about to record.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton in his glowing description of the early creation, thus
 alludes to Pan as the personification of Nature:
 
 </p>
           "...Universal Pan,<br>
            Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance,<br>
            Led on the eternal spring."<br>
 
 <p>And describing Eve's abode:
 
 </p>
           "...In shadier bower,<br>
            More sacred or sequestered, though but feigned,<br>
            Pan or Sylvanus never slept, nor nymph<br>
            Nor Faunus haunted."<br>
                                       Paradise Lost, B. IV.<br>
 
 <p>It was a pleasing trait in the old Paganism that it loved to trace
 in every operation of nature the agency of deity. The imagination
 nation of the Greeks peopled all the regions of earth and sea with
 divinities, to whose agency it attributed those phenomena which our
 philosophy ascribes to the operation of the laws of nature.
 Sometimes in our poetical moods we feel disposed to regret the change,
 and to think that the heart has lost as much as the head has gained by
 the substitution. The poet Wordsworth thus strongly expresses this
 sentiment:
 
 </p>
           "...Great God, I'd rather be<br>
            A Pagan, suckled in a creed outworn,<br>
            So might I, standing on this pleasant lea,<br>
            Have glimpses that would make me less forlorn;<br>
            Have sight of Proteus rising from the sea<br>
            And hear old Triton blow his wreathed horn."<br>
 
 <p>Schiller, in his poem "Die Gotter Griechenlands," expresses his
 regret for the overthrow of the beautiful mythology of ancient times
 in a way which has called forth an answer from a Christian poet,
 Mrs. E. Barrett Browning, in her poem called "The Dead Pan." The two
 following verses are a specimen:
 
 </p>
               "By your beauty which confesses<br>
                Some chief Beauty conquering you,<br>
                By our grand heroic guesses<br>
                Through your falsehood at the True,<br>
                We will weep not! earth shall roll<br>
                Heir to each god's aureole,<br>
                                    And Pan is dead.<br>
 
               "Earth outgrows the mythic fancies<br>
                Sung beside her in her youth;<br>
                And those debonaire romances<br>
                Sound but dull beside the truth.<br>
                Phoebus' chariot course is run!<br>
                Look up, poets, to the sun!<br>
                                   Pan, Pan is dead."<br>
 
 <p>These lines are founded on an early Christian tradition that when
 the heavenly host told the shepherds at Bethlehem of the birth of
 Christ, a deep groan, heard through all the isles of Greece, told that
 the great Pan was dead, and that all the royalty of Olympus was
 dethroned and the several deities were sent wandering in cold and
 darkness. So Milton in his "Hymn on the Nativity":
 
 </p>
           "The lonely mountains o'er<br>
            And the resounding shore,<br>
              A voice of weeping heard and loud lament;<br>
            From haunted spring and dale,<br>
            Edged with poplar pale,<br>
              The parting Genius is with sighing sent:<br>
            With flower-enwoven tresses torn,<br>
            The nymphs in twilight shade of tangled thickets mourn."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">ERISICHTHON.</h3>
 
 <p>Erisichthon was a profane person and a despiser of the gods, On
 one occasion he presumed to violate with the axe a grove sacred to
 Ceres. There stood in this grove a venerable oak, so large that it
 seemed a wood in itself, its ancient trunk towering aloft, whereon
 votive garlands were often hung and inscriptions carved expressing the
 gratitude of suppliants to the nymph of the tree. Often had the Dryads
 danced round it hand in hand. Its trunk measured fifteen cubits round,
 and it overtopped the other trees as they overtopped the shrubbery.
 But for all that, Erisichthon saw no reason why he should spare it and
 he ordered his servants to cut it down. When he saw them hesitate he
 snatched an axe from one, and thus impiously exclaimed: "I care not
 whether it be a tree beloved of the goddess or not; were it the
 goddess herself it should come down if it stood in my way." So saying,
 he lifted the axe and the oak seemed to shudder and utter a groan.
 When the first blow fell upon the trunk blood flowed from the wound.
 All the bystanders were horror-struck, and one of them ventured to
 remonstrate and hold back the fatal axe. Erisichthon, with a
 scornful look, said to him, "Receive the reward of your piety;" and
 turned against him the weapon which he had held aside from the tree,
 gashed his body with many wounds, and cut off his head. Then from
 the midst of the oak came a voice, "I who dwell in this tree am a
 nymph beloved of Ceres, and dying by your hands forewarn you that
 punishment awaits you." He desisted not from his crime, and at last
 the tree, sundered by repeated blows and drawn by ropes, fell with a
 crash and prostrated a great part of the grove in its fall.
 </p>
 <p>The Dryads, in dismay at the loss of their companion and at seeing
 the pride of the forest laid low, went in a body to Ceres, all clad in
 garments of mourning, and invoked punishment upon Erisichthon. She
 nodded her assent, and as she bowed her head the grain ripe for
 harvest in the laden fields bowed also. She planned a punishment so
 dire that one would pity him, if such a culprit as he could be pitied-
 to deliver him over to Famine. As Ceres herself could not approach
 Famine, for the Fates have ordained that these two goddesses shall
 never come together, she called an Oread from her mountain and spoke
 to her in these words: "There is a place in the farthest part of
 ice-clad Scythia, a sad and sterile region without trees and without
 crops. Cold dwells there, and Fear and Shuddering, and Famine. Go
 and tell the last to take possession of the bowels of Erisichthon. Let
 not abundance subdue her, nor the power of my gifts drive her away. Be
 not alarmed at the distance" (for Famine dwells very far from
 Ceres), "but take my chariot. The dragons are fleet and obey the rein,
 and will take you through the air in a short time." So she gave her
 the reins, and she drove away and soon reached Scythia. On arriving at
 Mount Caucasus she stopped the dragons and found Famine in a stony
 field, pulling up with teeth and claws the scanty herbage. Her hair
 was rough, her eyes sunk, her face pale, her lips blanched, her jaws
 covered with dust, and her skin drawn tight, so as to show all her
 bones. As the Oread saw her afar off (for she did not dare to come
 near), she delivered the commands of Ceres; and, though she stopped as
 short a time as possible, and kept her distance as well as she
 could, yet she began to feel hungry, and turned the dragons' heads and
 drove back to Thessaly.
 </p>
 <p>Famine obeyed the commands of Ceres and sped through the air to
 the dwelling of Erisichthon, entered the bedchamber of the guilty man,
 and found him asleep. She enfolded him with her wings and breathed
 herself into him, infusing her poison into his veins. Having
 discharged her task, she hastened to leave the land of plenty and
 returned to her accustomed haunts. Erisichthon still slept, and in his
 dreams craved food, and moved his jaws as if eating. When he awoke,
 his hunger was raging. Without a moment's delay he would have food set
 before him, of whatever kind earth, sea, or air produces; and
 complained of hunger even while he ate. What would have sufficed for a
 city or a nation, was not enough for him. The more he ate the more
 he craved. His hunger was like the sea, which receives all the rivers,
 yet is never filled; or like fire, that burns all the fuel that is
 heaped upon it, yet is still voracious for more.
 </p>
 <p>His property rapidly diminished under the unceasing demands of his
 appetite, but his hunger continued unabated. At length he had spent
 all and had only his daughter left, a daughter worthy of a better
 parent. Her too he sold. She scorned to be a slave of a purchaser
 and as she stood by the seaside raised her hands in prayer to Neptune.
 He heard her prayer, and though her new master was not far off and had
 his eye upon her a moment before, Neptune changed her form and made
 her assume that of a fisherman busy at his occupation. Her master,
 looking for her and seeing her in her altered form, addressed her
 and said, "Good fisherman, whither went the maiden whom I saw just
 now, with hair dishevelled and in humble garb, standing about where
 you stand? Tell me truly; so may your luck be good and not a fish
 nibble at your hook and get away." She perceived that her prayer was
 answered and rejoiced inwardly at hearing herself inquired of about
 herself. She replied, "Pardon me, stranger, but I have been so
 intent upon my line that I have seen nothing else; but I wish I may
 never catch another fish if I believe any woman or other person except
 myself to have been hereabouts for some time." He was deceived and
 went his way, thinking his slave had escaped. Then she resumed her own
 form. Her father was well pleased to find her still with him, and
 the money too that he got by the sale of her; so he sold her again.
 But she was changed by the favour of Neptune as often as she was sold,
 now into a horse, now a bird, now an ox, and now a stag- got away from
 her purchasers and came home. By this base method the starving
 father procured food; but not enough for his wants, and at last hunger
 compelled him to devour his limbs, and he strove to nourish his body
 by eating his body, till death relieved him from the vengeance of
 Ceres.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">RHOECUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The Hamadryads could appreciate services as well as punish injuries.
 The story of Rhoecus proves this. Rhoecus, happening to see an oak
 just ready to fall, ordered his servants to prop it up. The nymph, who
 had been on the point of perishing with the tree, came and expressed
 her gratitude to him for having saved her life and bade him ask what
 reward he would. Rhoecus boldly asked her love and the nymph yielded
 to his desire. She at the same time charged him to be constant and
 told him that a bee should be her messenger and let him know when
 she would admit his society. One time the bee came to Rhoecus when
 he was playing at draughts and he carelessly brushed it away. This
 so incensed the nymph that she deprived him of sight.
 
 </p>
 <p>Our countryman, J. R. Lowell, has taken this story for the subject
 of one of his shorter poems. He introduces it thus:
 
 </p>
           "Hear now this fairy legend of old Greece,<br>
            As full of freedom, youth and beauty still,<br>
            As the immortal freshness of that grace<br>
            Carved for all ages on some Attic frieze."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE WATER DEITIES.</h3>
 
 <p>Oceanus and Tethys were the Titans who ruled over the watery
 elements. When Jove and his brothers overthrew the Titans and
 assumed their power, Neptune and Amphitrite succeeded to the
 dominion of the waters in place of Oceanus and Tethys.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">NEPTUNE.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Neptune was the chief of the water deities. The symbol of his
 power was the trident, or spear with three points, with which he
 used to shatter rocks, to call forth or subdue storms, to shake the
 shores and the like. He created the horse and was the patron of
 horse races. His own horses had brazen hoofs and golden manes. They
 drew his chariot over the sea, which became smooth before him, while
 the monsters of the deep gambolled about his path.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">AMPHITRITE.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Amphitrite was the wife of Neptune. She was the daughter of Nereus
 and Doris, and the mother of Triton. Neptune, to pay his court to
 Amphitrite, came riding on a dolphin. Having won her he rewarded the
 dolphin by placing him among the stars.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">NEREUS AND DORIS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Nereus and Doris were the parents of the Nereids, the most
 celebrated of whom were Amphitrite, Thetis, the mother of Achilles,
 and Galatea, who was loved by the Cyclops Polyphemus: Nereus was
 distinguished for his knowledge and his love of truth and justice,
 whence he was termed an elder; the gift of prophecy was also
 assigned to him.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TRITON AND PROTEUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Triton was the son of Neptune and Amphitrite, and the poets made him
 his father's trumpeter. Proteus was also a son of Neptune. He, like
 Nereus, is styled a sea-elder for his wisdom and knowledge of future
 events. His peculiar power was that of changing his shape at will.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THETIS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Thetis, the daughter of Nereus and Doris, was so beautiful that
 Jupiter himself sought her in marriage; but having learned from
 Prometheus the Titan that Thetis should bear a son who should be
 greater than his father, Jupiter desisted from his suit and decreed
 that Thetis should be the wife of a mortal. By the aid of Chiron the
 Centaur, Peleus succeeded in winning the goddess for his bride and
 their son was the renowned Achilles. In our chapter on the Trojan
 war it will appear that Thetis was a faithful mother to him, aiding
 him in all difficulties, and watching over his interests from the
 first to the last.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">LEUCOTHEA AND PALAEMON.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Ino, the daughter of Cadmus and wife of Athamas, flying from her
 frantic husband with her little son Melicertes in her arms, sprang
 from a cliff into the sea. The gods, out of compassion, make her a
 goddess of the sea, under the name of Leucothea, and him a god,
 under that of Palaemon. Both were held powerful to save from shipwreck
 and were invoked by sailors. Palaemon was usually represented riding
 on a dolphin. The Isthmian games were celebrated in his honour. He was
 called Portunus by the Romans, and believed to have jurisdiction of
 the ports and shores.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton alludes to all these deities in the song at the conclusion of
 "Comus":
 
 </p>
               "Sabrina fair...<br>
                Listen and appear to us,<br>
                In name of great Oceanus;<br>
                By the earth-shaking Neptune's mace,<br>
                And Tethys' grave, majestic pace;<br>
                By hoary Nereus' wrinkled look,<br>
                And the Carpathian wizard's hook,*<br>
 
                By scaly Triton's winding shell,<br>
                And old soothsaying Glaucus' spell,<br>
                By Leucothea's lovely hands,<br>
                And her son who rules the strands;<br>
                By Thetis' tinsel-slippered feet,<br>
                And the songs of Sirens sweet;" etc.<br>
 
 <p>* Proteus.
 
 </p>
 <p>Armstrong, the poet of the "Art of Preserving Health," under the
 inspiration of Hygeia, the goddess of health, thus celebrates the
 Naiads. Paeon is a name both of Apollo and AEsculapius.
 
 </p>
         "Come ye Naiads! to the fountains lead!<br>
          Propitious maids! the task remains to sing<br>
          Your gifts (so Paeon, so the powers of Health<br>
          Command), to praise your crystal element.<br>
          O comfortable streams! with eager lips<br>
          And trembling hands the languid thirsty quaff<br>
          New life in you; fresh vigour fills their veins.<br>
          No warmer cups the rural ages knew,<br>
          None warmer sought the sires of humankind;<br>
          Happy in temperate peace their equal days<br>
          Felt not the alternate fits of feverish mirth<br>
          And sick dejection; still serene and pleased,<br>
          Blessed with divine immunity from ills,<br>
          Long centuries they lived; their only fate<br>
          Was ripe old age, and rather sleep than death."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE CAMENAE.</h3>
 
 <p>By this name the Latins designated the Muses, but included under
 it also some other deities, principally nymphs of fountains. Egeria
 was one of them, whose fountain and grotto are still shown. It was
 said that Numa, the second king of Rome, was favoured by this nymph
 with secret interviews, in which she taught him those lessons of
 wisdom and of law which he embodied in the institutions of his
 rising nation. After the death of Numa the nymph pined away and was
 changed into a fountain.
 
 </p>
 <p>Byron, in "Childe Harold," Canto IV., thus alludes to Egeria and her
 grotto:
 
 </p>
         "Here didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,<br>
          Egeria! all thy heavenly bosom beating<br>
          For the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;<br>
          The purple midnight veiled that mystic meeting<br>
          With her most starry canopy;" etc.<br>
 
 <p>Tennyson, also, in his "Palace of Art," gives us a glimpse of the
 royal lover expecting the interview:
 
 </p>
           "Holding one hand against his ear,<br>
              To list a footfall ere he saw<br>
            The wood-nymph, stayed the Tuscan king to hear<br>
              Of wisdom and of law."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE WINDS.</h3>
 
 <p>When so many less active agencies were personified, it is not to
 be supposed that the winds failed to be so. They were Boreas or
 Aquilo, the north wind; Zephyrus or Favonius, the west; Notus or
 Auster, the south; and Eurus, the east. The first two have been
 chiefly celebrated by the poets, the former as the type of rudeness,
 the latter of gentleness. Boreas loved the nymph Orithyia, and tried
 to play the lover's part, but met with poor success. It was hard for
 him to breathe gently, and sighing was out of the question. Weary at
 last of fruitless endeavours, he acted out his true character,
 seized the maiden and carried her off. Their children were Zetes and
 Calais, winged warriors, who accompanied the Argonautic expedition,
 and did good service in an encounter with those monstrous birds the
 Harpies.
 
 </p>
 <p>Zephyrus was the lover of Flora. Milton alludes to them in "Paradise
 Lost," where he describes Adam waking and contemplating Eve still
 asleep.
 
 </p>
         "...He on his side<br>
          Leaning half raised, with looks of cordial love,<br>
          Hung over her enamoured, and beheld<br>
          Beauty which; whether waking or asleep,<br>
          Shot forth peculiar graces; then with voice,<br>
          Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes,<br>
          Her hand soft touching, whispered thus: 'Awake!<br>
          My fairest, my espoused, my latest found,<br>
          Heaven's last, best gift, my ever-new delight.'"<br>
 
 <p>Dr. Young, the poet of the "Night Thoughts," addressing the idle and
 luxurious, says:
 
 </p>
           "Ye delicate! who nothing can support<br>
            (Yourselves most insupportable) for whom<br>
            The winter rose must blow,...<br>
            ....and silky soft<br>
            Favonius breathe still softer or be chid!"<br>
