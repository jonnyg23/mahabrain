 <h2 align="CENTER">THE FALL OF TROY- RETURN OF THE GREEKS-</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">AGAMEMNON, ORESTES AND ELECTRA.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE FALL OF TROY.</h3>
 
 <p>THE story of the Iliad ends with the death of Hector, and it is from
 the Odyssey and later poems that we learn the fate of the other
 heroes. After the death of Hector, Troy did not immediately fall,
 but receiving aid from new allies still continued its resistance.
 One of these allies was Memnon, the AEthiopian prince, whose story
 we have already told. Another was Penthesilea, queen of the Amazons,
 who came with a band of female warriors. All the authorities attest
 their valour and the fearful effect of their war cry. Penthesilea slew
 many of the bravest warriors, but was at last slain by Achilles. But
 when the hero bent over his fallen foe, and contemplated her beauty,
 youth and valour, he bitterly regretted his victory. Thersites, an
 insolent brawler and demagogue, ridiculed his grief, and was in
 consequence slain by the hero.
 </p>
 <p>Achilles by chance had seen Polyxena, daughter of King Priam,
 perhaps on occasion of the truce which was allowed the Trojans for the
 burial of Hector. He was captivated with her charms, and to win her in
 marriage agreed to use his influence with the Greeks to grant peace to
 Troy. While in the temple of Apollo, negotiating the marriage, Paris
 discharged at him a poisoned arrow, which, guided by Apollo, wounded
 Achilles in the heel, the only vulnerable part about him. For Thetis
 his mother had dipped him when an infant in the river Styx, which made
 every part of him invulnerable except the heel by which she held him.*
 
 </p>
 <p>* The story of the invulnerability of Achilles is not found in
 Homer, and is inconsistent with his account. For how could Achilles
 require the aid of celestial armour if he were invulnerable?
 
 </p>
 <p>The body of Achilles so treacherously slain was rescued by Ajax
 and Ulysses. Thetis directed the Greeks to bestow her son's armour
 on the hero who of all the survivors should be judged most deserving
 of it. Ajax and Ulysses were the only claimants; a select number of
 the other chiefs were appointed to award the prize. It was awarded
 to Ulysses, thus placing wisdom before valour, whereupon Ajax slew
 himself. On the spot where his blood sank into the earth a flower
 sprang up, called the hyacinth, bearing on its leaves the first two
 letters of the name of Ajax, Ai, the Greek for "woe." Thus Ajax is a
 claimant with the boy Hyacinthus for the honour of giving birth to
 this flower. There is a species of Larkspur which represents the
 hyacinth of the poets in preserving the memory of this event, the
 Delphinium Ajacis- Ajax's Larkspur.
 </p>
 <p>It was now discovered that Troy could not be taken but by the aid of
 the arrows of Hercules. They were in possession of Philoctetes, the
 friend who had been with Hercules at the last and lighted his
 funeral pyre. Philoctetes had joined the Grecian expedition against
 Troy, but had accidentally wounded his foot with one of the poisoned
 arrows, and the smell from his wound proved so offensive that his
 companions carried him to the isle of Lemnos and left him there.
 Diomed was now sent to induce him to rejoin the army. He succeeded.
 Philoctetes was cured of his wound by Machaon, and Paris was the first
 victim of the fatal arrows. In his distress Paris bethought him of one
 whom in his prosperity he had forgotten. This was the nymph OEnone,
 whom he had married when a youth, and had abandoned for the fatal
 beauty Helen. OEnone remembering the wrongs she had suffered,
 refused to heal the wound, and Paris went back to Troy and died.
 OEnone quickly repented, and hastened after him with remedies, but
 came too late, and in her grief hung herself.*
 
 </p>
 <p>* Tennyson has chosen OEnone as the subject of a short poem; but
 he has omitted the most poetical part of the story, the return of
 Paris wounded, her cruelty and subsequent repentance.
 
 </p>
 <p>There was in Troy a celebrated statue of Minerva called the
 Palladium. It was said to have fallen from heaven, and the belief
 was that the city could not be taken so long as this statue remained
 within it. Ulysses and Diomed entered the city in disguise and
 succeeded in obtaining the Palladium, which they carried off to the
 Grecian camp.
 </p>
 <p>But Troy still held out, and the Greeks began to despair of ever
 subduing it by force, and by advice of Ulysses resolved to resort to
 stratagem. They pretended to be making preparations to abandon the
 siege, and a portion of the ships were withdrawn and lay hid behind
 a neighbouring island. The Greeks then constructed an immense wooden
 horse, which they gave out was intended as a propitiatory offering
 to Minerva, but in fact was filled with armed men. The remaining
 Greeks then betook themselves to their ships and sailed away, as if
 for a final departure. The Trojans, seeing the encampment broken up
 and the fleet gone, concluded the enemy to have abandoned the siege.
 The gates were thrown open, and the whole population issued forth
 rejoicing at the long-prohibited liberty of passing freely over the
 scene of the late encampment. The great horse was the chief object
 of curiosity. All wondered what it could be for. Some recommended to
 take it into the city as a trophy; others felt afraid of it.
 </p>
 <p>While they hesitate, Laocoon, the priest of Neptune, exclaims, "What
 madness, citizens, is this? Have you not learned enough of Grecian
 fraud to be on your guard against it? For my part, I fear the Greeks
 even when they offer gifts."* So saying he threw his lance at the
 horse's side. It struck, and a hollow sound reverberated like a groan.
 Then perhaps the people might have taken his advice and destroyed
 the fatal horse and all its contents; but just at that moment a
 group of people appeared, dragging forward one who seemed a prisoner
 and a Greek. Stupefied with terror, he was brought before the
 chiefs, who reassured him, promising that his life should be spared on
 condition of his returning true answers to the questions asked him. He
 informed them that he was a Greek, Sinon by name, and that in
 consequence of the malice of Ulysses he had been left behind by his
 countrymen at their departure. With regard to the wooden horse, he
 told them that it was a propitiatory offering to Minerva, and made
 so huge for the express purpose of preventing its being carried within
 the city; for Calchas the prophet had told them that if the Trojans
 took possession of it they would assuredly triumph over the Greeks.
 This language turned the tide of the people's feelings and they
 began to think how they might best secure the monstrous horse and
 the favourable auguries connected with it, when suddenly a prodigy
 occurred which left no room to doubt. There appeared, advancing over
 the sea, two immense serpents. They came upon the land, and the
 crowd fled in all directions. The serpents advanced directly to the
 spot where Laocoon stood with his two sons. They first attacked the
 children, winding round their bodies and breathing their
 pestilential breath in their faces. The father, attempting to rescue
 them, is next seized and involved in the serpents' coils. He struggles
 to tear them away, but they overpower all his efforts and strangle him
 and the children in their poisonous folds. This event was regarded
 as a clear indication of the displeasure of the gods at Laocoon's
 irreverent treatment of the wooden horse, which they no longer
 hesitated to regard as a sacred object, and prepared to introduce with
 due solemnity into the city. This was done with songs and triumphal
 acclamations, and the day closed with festivity. In the night the
 armed men who were enclosed in the body of the horse, being let out by
 the traitor Sinon, opened the gates of the city to their friends,
 who had returned under cover of the night. The city was set on fire;
 the people, overcome with feasting and sleep, put to the sword, and
 Troy completely subdued.
 
 </p>
 <p>* See Proverbial Expressions, no. 6.
 
 </p>
 <p>One of the most celebrated groups of statuary in existence is that
 of Laocoon and his children in the embrace of the serpents. The
 original is in the Vatican at Rome. The following lines are from the
 "Childe Harold" of Byron:
 
 </p>
         "Now turning to the Vatican go see<br>
          Laocoon's torture dignifying pain;<br>
          A father's love and mortal's agony<br>
          With an immortal's patience blending;- vain<br>
          The struggle! vain against the coiling strain<br>
          And gripe and deepening of the dragon's grasp<br>
          The old man's clinch; the long envenomed chain<br>
          Rivets the living links; the enormous asp<br>
          Enforces pang on pang and stifles gasp on gasp."<br>
 
 <p>The comic poets will also occasionally borrow a classical
 allusion. The following is from Swift's "Description of a City
 Shower":
 
 </p>
         "Boxed in a chair the beau impatient sits,<br>
          While spouts run clattering o'er the roof by fits,<br>
          And ever and anon with frightful din<br>
          The leather sounds; he trembles from within.<br>
          So when Troy chairmen bore the wooden steed<br>
          Pregnant with Greeks impatient to be freed,<br>
          (Those bully Greeks, who, as the moderns do,<br>
          Instead of paying chairmen, run them through);<br>
          Laocoon struck the outside with a spear,<br>
          And each imprisoned champion quaked with fear."<br>
 
 <p>King Priam lived to see the downfall of his kingdom and was slain at
 last on the fatal night when the Greeks took the city. He had armed
 himself and was about to mingle with the combatants, but was prevailed
 on by Hecuba, his aged queen, to take refuge with herself and his
 daughters as a suppliant at the altar of Jupiter. While there, his
 youngest son Polites, pursued by Pyrrhus, the son of Achilles,
 rushed in wounded, and expired at the feet of his father; whereupon
 Priam, overcome with indignation, hurled his spear with feeble hand
 against Pyrrhus,* and was forthwith slain by him.
 
 </p>
 <p>* Pyrrhus's exclamation, "Not such aid nor such defenders does the
 time require," has become proverbial. See Proverbial Expressions,
 no. 7.
 
 </p>
 <p>Queen Hecuba and her daughter Cassandra were carried captives to
 Greece. Cassandra had been loved by Apollo, and he gave her the gift
 of prophecy; but afterwards offended with her, he rendered the gift
 unavailing by ordaining that her predictions should never be believed.
 Polyxena, another daughter, who had been loved by Achilles, was
 demanded by the ghost of that warrior, and was sacrificed by the
 Greeks upon his tomb.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">MENELAUS AND HELEN.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Our readers will be anxious to know the fate of Helen, the fair
 but guilty occasion of so much slaughter. On the fall of Troy Menelaus
 recovered possession of his wife, who had not ceased to love him,
 though she had yielded to the might of Venus and deserted him for
 another. After the death of Paris she aided the Greeks secretly on
 several occasions, and in particular when Ulysses and Diomed entered
 the city in disguise to carry off the Palladium. She saw and
 recognized Ulysses, but kept the secret and even assisted them in
 obtaining the image. Thus she became reconciled to her husband, and
 they were among the first to leave the shores of Troy for their native
 land. But having incurred the displeasure of the gods they were driven
 by storms from shore to shore of the Mediterranean, visiting Cyprus,
 Phoenicia and Egypt. In Egypt they were kindly treated and presented
 with rich gifts, of which Helen's share was a golden spindle and a
 basket on wheels. The basket was to hold the wool and spools for the
 queen's work.
 
 </p>
 <p>Dyer, in his poem of the "Fleece," thus alludes to this incident:
 
 </p>
         "...many yet adhere<br>
          To the ancient distaff, at the bosom fixed,<br>
          Casting the whirling spindle as they walk.<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">.     .    .     .     .     .     .     .</h3>
 
          This was of old, in no inglorious days,<br>
          The mode of spinning, when the Egyptian prince<br>
          A golden distaff gave that beauteous nymph,<br>
          Too beauteous Helen; no uncourtly gift."<br>
 
 <p>Milton also alludes to a famous recipe for an invigorating
 draught, called Nepenthe, which the Egyptian queen gave to Helen:
 
 </p>
         "Not that Nepenthes which the wife of Thone<br>
          In Egypt gave to Jove-born Helena,<br>
          Is of such power to stir up joy as this,<br>
          To life so friendly or so cool to thirst."<br>
                                                        Comus.<br>
 
 <p>Menelaus and Helen at length arrived in safety at Sparta, resumed
 their royal dignity, and lived and reigned in splendour; and when
 Telemachus, the son of Ulysses, in search of his father, arrived at
 Sparta, he found Menelaus and Helen celebrating the marriage of
 their daughter Hermione to Neoptolemus, son of Achilles.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">AGAMEMNON, ORESTES AND ELECTRA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Agamemnon, the general-in-chief of the Greeks, the brother of
 Menelaus, and who had been drawn into the quarrel to avenge his
 brother's wrongs, not his own, was not so fortunate in the issue.
 During his absence his wife Clytemnestra had been false to him, and
 when his return was expected, she with her paramour, AEgisthus, laid a
 plan for his destruction, and at the banquet given to celebrate his
 return, murdered him.
 </p>
 <p>It was intended by the conspirators to slay his son Orestes also,
 a lad not yet old enough to be an object of apprehension, but from
 whom, if he should be suffered to grow up, there might be danger.
 Electra, the sister of Orestes, saved her brother's life by sending
 him secretly away to his uncle Strophius, King of Phocis. In the
 palace of Strophius Orestes grew up with the king's son Pylades, and
 formed with him that ardent friendship which bas become proverbial.
 Electra frequently reminded her brother by messengers of the duty of
 avenging his father's death, and when grown up he consulted the oracle
 of Delphi, which confirmed him in his design. He therefore repaired in
 disguise to Argos, pretending to be a messenger from Strophius, who
 had come to announce the death of Orestes, and brought the ashes of
 the deceased in a funeral urn. After visiting his father's tomb and.
 sacrificing upon it, according to the rites of the ancients he made
 himself known to his sister Electra, and soon after slew both
 AEgisthus and Clytemnestra.
 </p>
 <p>This revolting act, the slaughter of a mother by her son, though
 alleviated by the guilt of the victim and the express command of the
 gods, did not fail to awaken in the breasts of the ancients the same
 abhorrence that it does in ours. The Eumenides, avenging deities,
 seized upon Orestes, and drove him frantic from land to land.
 Pylades accompanied him in his wanderings and watched over him. At
 length, in answer to a second appeal to the oracle, he was directed to
 go to Tauris in Scythia, and to bring thence a statue of Diana which
 was believed to have fallen from heaven. Accordingly Orestes and
 Pylades went to Tauris, where the barbarous people were accustomed
 to sacrifice to the goddess all strangers who fell into their hands.
 The two friends were seized and carried bound to the temple to be made
 victims. But the priestess of Diana was no other than Iphigenia, the
 sister of Orestes, who, our readers will remember, was snatched away
 by Diana at the moment when she was about to be sacrificed.
 Ascertaining from the prisoners who they were, Iphigenia disclosed
 herself to them, and the three made their escape with the statue of
 the goddess, and returned to Mycenae.
 </p>
 <p>But Orestes was not yet relieved from the vengeance of the
 Erinyes. At length he took refuge with Minerva at Athens. The
 goddess afforded him protection, and appointed the court of
 Areopagus to decide his fate. The Erinyes brought forward their
 accusation, and Orestes made the command of the Delphic oracle his
 excuse. When the court voted and the voices were equally divided,
 Orestes was acquitted by the command of Minerva.
 
 </p>
 <p>Byron, in "Childe Harold," Canto IV., alludes to the story of
 Orestes:
 
 </p>
         "O thou who never yet of human wrong<br>
          Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis!<br>
          Thou who didst call the Furies from the abyss,<br>
          And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss,<br>
          For that unnatural retribution,-just<br>
          Had it but been from hands less near,- in this,<br>
          Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!"<br>
 
 <p>One of the most pathetic scenes in the ancient drama is that in
 which Sophocles represents the meeting of Orestes and Electra, on
 his return from Phocis. Orestes, mistaking Electra for one of the
 domestics, and desirous of keeping his arrival a secret till the
 hour of vengeance should arrive, produces the urn in which his ashes
 are supposed to rest. Electra, believing him to be really dead,
 takes the urn and, embracing it, pours forth her grief in language
 full of tenderness and despair.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton in one of his sonnets, says:
 
 </p>
               "...The repeated air<br>
            Of sad Electra's poet had the power<br>
            To save the Athenian walls from ruin bare."<br>
 
 <p>This alludes to the story that when, on one occasion, the city of
 Athens was at the mercy of her Spartan foes, and it was proposed to
 destroy it, the thought was rejected upon the accidental quotation, by
 some one, of a chorus of Euripides.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">TROY.</h3>
 
 
 <p>After hearing so much about the city of Troy and its heroes, the
 reader will perhaps be surprised to learn that the exact site of
 that famous city is still a matter of dispute. There are some vestiges
 of tombs on the plain which most nearly answers to the description
 given by Homer and the ancient geographers, but no other evidence of
 the former existence of a great city. Byron thus describes the present
 appearance of the scene:
 
 </p>
           "The winds are high, and Helle's tide<br>
              Rolls darkly heaving to the main;<br>
            And night's descending shadows hide<br>
              That field with blood bedewed in vain,<br>
            The desert of old Priam's pride,<br>
              The tombs, sole relics of his reign.<br>
            All- save immortal dreams that could beguile<br>
            The blind old man of Scio's rocky isle."<br>
                                                Bride of Abydos.<br>
