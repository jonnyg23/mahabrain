 <h2 align="CENTER">PYTHAGORAS- EGYPTIAN DEITIES- ORACLES.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">PYTHAGORAS.</h3>
 
 <p>THE teachings of Anchises to AEneas, respecting the nature of the
 human soul, were in conformity with the doctrines of the Pythagoreans.
 Pythagoras (born five hundred and forty years B.C.) was a native of
 the island of Samos, but passed the chief portion of his life at
 Crotona in Italy. He is therefore sometimes called "the Samian," and
 sometimes "the philosopher of Crotona." When young he travelled
 extensively, and it is said visited Egypt, where he was instructed
 by the priests in all their learning, and afterwards journeyed to
 the East, and visited the Persian and Chaldean Magi, and the
 Brahmins of India.
 </p>
 <p>At Crotona, where he finally established himself, his
 extraordinary qualities collected round him a great number of
 disciples. The inhabitants were notorious for luxury and
 licentiousness, but the good effects of his influence were soon
 visible. Sobriety and temperance succeeded. Six hundred of the
 inhabitants became his disciples and enrolled themselves in a
 society to aid each other in the pursuit of wisdom, uniting their
 property in one common stock for the benefit of the whole. They were
 required to practise the greatest purity and simplicity of manners.
 The first lesson they learned was silence; for a time they were
 required to be only hearers. "He [Pythagoras] said so" (Ipse dixit),
 was to be held by them as sufficient, without any proof. It was only
 the advanced pupils, after years of patient submission, who were
 allowed to ask questions and to state objections.
 </p>
 <p>Pythagoras considered numbers as the essence and principle of all
 things, and attributed to them a real and distinct existence; so that,
 in his view, they were the elements out of which the universe was
 constructed. How he conceived this process has never been
 satisfactorily explained. He traced the various forms and phenomena of
 the world to numbers as their basis and essence. The "Monad" or unit
 he regarded as the source of all numbers. The number Two was
 imperfect, and the cause of increase and division. Three was called
 the number of the whole because it had a beginning, middle, and end.
 Four, representing the square, is in the highest degree perfect; and
 Ten, as it contains the sum of the four prime numbers, comprehends all
 musical and arithmetical proportions, and denotes the system of the
 world.
 </p>
 <p>As the numbers proceed from the monad, so he regarded the pure and
 simple essence of the Deity as the source of all the forms of
 nature. Gods, demons, and heroes are emanations of the Supreme, and
 there is a fourth emanation, the human soul. This is immortal, and
 when freed from the fetters of the body passes to the habitation of
 the dead, where it remains till it returns to the world, to dwell in
 some other human or animal body, and at last, when sufficiently
 purified, it returns to the source from which it proceeded. This
 doctrine of the transmigration of souls (metempsychosis), which was
 originally Egyptian and connected with the doctrine of reward and
 punishment of human actions, was the chief cause why the
 Pythagoreans killed no animals. Ovid represents Pythagoras
 addressing his disciples in these words: "Souls never die, but
 always on quitting one abode pass to another. I myself can remember
 that in the time of the Trojan war I was Euphorbus, the son of
 Panthus, and fell by the spear of Menelaus. Lately being in the temple
 of Juno, at Argos, I recognized my shield hung up there among the
 trophies. All things change, nothing perishes. The soul passes
 hither and thither, occupying now this body, now that, passing from
 the body of a beast into that of a man, and thence to a beast's again.
 As wax is stamped with certain figures, then melted, then stamped anew
 with others, yet is always the same wax, so the soul, being always the
 same, yet wears, at different times, different forms. Therefore, if
 the love of kindred is not extinct in your bosoms, forbear, I
 entreat you, to violate the life of those who may haply be your own
 relatives."
 
 </p>
 <p>Shakespeare, in the "Merchant of Venice," makes Gratiano allude to
 the metempsychosis, where he says to Shylock:
 
 </p>
           "Thou almost mak'st me waver in my faith,<br>
            To hold opinion with Pythagoras,<br>
            That souls of animals infuse themselves<br>
            Into the trunks of men; thy currish spirit<br>
            Governed a wolf, who, hanged for human slaughter,<br>
            Infused his soul in thee; for thy desires<br>
            Are wolfish, bloody, starved and ravenous."<br>
 
 <p>The relation of the notes of the musical scale to numbers, whereby
 harmony results from vibrations in equal times, and discord from the
 reverse, led Pythagoras to apply the word "harmony" to the visible
 creation, meaning by it the just adaptation of parts to each other.
 This is the idea which Dryden expresses in the beginning of his
 "Song for St. Cecilia's Day":
 
 </p>
           "From harmony, from heavenly harmony<br>
            This everlasting frame began;<br>
            From harmony to harmony<br>
            Through all the compass of the notes it ran,<br>
            The Diapason closing full in Man."<br>
 
 <p>In the centre of the universe (he taught) there was a central
 fire, the principle of life. The central fire was surrounded by the
 earth, the moon, the sun, and the five planets. The distances of the
 various heavenly bodies from one another were conceived to
 correspond to the proportions of the musical scale. The heavenly
 bodies, with the gods who inhabited them, were supposed to perform a
 choral dance round the central fire, "not without song." It is this
 doctrine which Shakespeare alludes to when he makes Lorenzo teach
 astronomy to Jessica in this fashion:
 
 </p>
         "Look, Jessica, see how the floor of heaven<br>
          Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold!<br>
          There's not the smallest orb that thou behold'st<br>
          But in his motion like an angel sings,<br>
          Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubim;<br>
          Such harmony is in immortal souls!<br>
          But whilst this muddy vesture of decay<br>
          Doth grossly close it in we cannot hear it."<br>
                                                 Merchant of Venice.<br>
 
 <p>The spheres were conceived to be crystalline or glassy fabrics
 arranged over one another like a nest of bowls reversed. In the
 substance of each sphere one or more of the heavenly bodies was
 supposed to be fixed, so as to move with it. As the spheres are
 transparent we look through them and see the heavenly bodies which
 they contain and carry round with them. But as these spheres cannot
 move on one another without friction, a sound is thereby produced
 which is of exquisite harmony, too fine for mortal ears to
 recognize. Milton, in his "Hymn on the Nativity," thus alludes to
 the music of the spheres:
 
 </p>
         "Ring out, ye crystal spheres!<br>
          Once bless our human ears<br>
            (If ye have power to charm our senses so);<br>
          And let your silver chime<br>
          Move in melodious time;<br>
            And let the bass of Heaven's deep organ blow;<br>
          And with your ninefold harmony<br>
          Make up full concert to the angelic symphony."<br>
 
 <p>Pythagoras is said to have invented the lyre. Our own poet
 Longfellow, in "Verses to a Child," thus relates the story:
 
 </p>
           "As great Pythagoras of yore,<br>
            Standing beside the blacksmith's door,<br>
            And hearing the hammers as they smote<br>
            The anvils with a different note,<br>
            Stole from the varying tones that hung<br>
            Vibrant on every iron tongue,<br>
            The secret of the sounding wire,<br>
            And formed the seven-chorded lyre."<br>
 
 <p>See also the same poet's "Occultation of Orion"-
 
 </p>
           "The Samian's great AEolian lyre."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">SYBARIS AND CROTONA.</h3>
 
 <p>Sybaris, a neighbouring city to Crotona, was as celebrated for
 luxury and effeminacy as Crotona for the reverse. The name has
 become proverbial. J. R. Lowell uses it in this sense in his
 charming little poem "To the Dandelion":
 
 </p>
         "Not in mid June the golden-cuirassed bee<br>
          Feels a more summer-like, warm ravishment<br>
              In the white lily's breezy tent<br>
          (His conquered Sybaris) than I when first<br>
          From the dark green thy yellow circles burst."<br>
 
 <p>A war arose between the two cities, and Sybaris was conquered and
 destroyed. Milo, the celebrated athlete, led the army of Crotona. Many
 stories are told of Milo's vast strength, such as his carrying a
 heifer of four years old upon his shoulders and afterwards eating
 the whole of it in a single day. The mode of his death is thus
 related: As he was passing through a forest he saw the trunk of a tree
 which had been partially split open by wood-cutters, and attempted
 to rend it further; but the wood closed upon his hands and held him
 fast, in which state he was attacked and devoured by wolves.
 
 </p>
 <p>Byron, in his "Ode to Napoleon Bonaparte," alludes to the story of
 Milo:
 
 </p>
             "He who of old would rend the oak<br>
                Deemed not of the rebound;<br>
              Chained by the trunk he vainly broke,<br>
                Alone, how looked he round!"<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">EGYPTIAN DEITIES.</h3>
 
 <p>The Egyptians acknowledged as the highest deity Amun, afterwards
 called Zeus, or Jupiter Ammon. Amun manifested himself in his word
 or will, which created Kneph and Athor, of different sexes. From Kneph
 and Athor proceeded Osiris and Isis. Osiris was worshipped as the
 god of the sun, the source of warmth, life, and fruitfulness, in
 addition to which he was also regarded as the god of the Nile, who
 annually visited his wife, Isis (the Earth), by means of an
 inundation. Serapis or Hermes is sometimes represented as identical
 with Osiris, and sometimes as a distinct divinity, the ruler of
 Tartarus and god of medicine. Anubis is the guardian god,
 represented with a dog's head, emblematic of his character of fidelity
 and watchfulness. Horus or Harpocrates was the son of Osiris. He is
 represented seated on a Lotus flower, with his finger on his lips,
 as the god of Silence.
 </p>
 <p>In one of Moore's "Irish Melodies" is an allusion to Harpocrates:
 
 </p>
           "Thyself shall, under some rosy bower,<br>
              Sit mute, with thy finger on thy lip;<br>
            Like him, the boy, who born among<br>
              The flowers that on the Nile-stream blush,<br>
            Sits ever thus,- his only song<br>
              To Earth and Heaven, 'Hush all, hush!"<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">MYTH OF OSIRIS AND ISIS.</h3>
 
 <p>Osiris and Isis were at one time induced to descend to the earth
 to bestow gifts and blessings on its inhabitants. Isis showed them
 first the use of wheat and barley, and Osiris made the instruments
 of agriculture and taught men the use of them, as well as how to
 harness the ox to the plough. He then gave men laws, the institution
 of marriage, a civil organization, and taught them how to worship
 the gods. After he had thus made the valley of the Nile a happy
 country, he assembled a host with which he went to bestow his
 blessings upon the rest of the world. He conquered the nations
 everywhere, but not with weapons, only with music and eloquence. His
 brother, Typhon saw this, and filled with envy and malice sought
 during his absence to usurp his throne. But Isis, who held the reins
 of government, frustrated his plans. Still more embittered, he now
 resolved to kill his brother. This he did in the following manner:
 Having organized a conspiracy of seventy-two members, he went with
 them to the feast which was celebrated in honour of the king's return.
 He then caused a box or chest to be brought in, which had been made to
 fit exactly the size of Osiris, and declared that he would give that
 chest of precious wood to whomsoever could get into it. The rest tried
 in vain, but no sooner was Osiris in it than Typhon and his companions
 closed the lid and flung the chest into the Nile. When Isis heard of
 the cruel murder she wept and mourned, and then with her hair shorn,
 clothed in black and beating her breast, she sought diligently for the
 body of her husband. In this search she was materially assisted by
 Anubis, the son of Osiris and Nephthys. They sought in vain for some
 time; for when the chest, carried by the waves to the shores of
 Byblos, had become entangled in the reeds that grew at the edge of the
 water, the divine power that dwelt in the body of Osiris imparted such
 strength to the shrub that it grew into a mighty tree, enclosing in
 its trunk the coffin of the god. This tree with its sacred deposit was
 shortly after felled, and erected as a column in the palace of the
 king of Phoenicia. But at length by the aid of Anubis and the sacred
 birds, Isis ascertained these facts, and then went to the royal
 city. There she offered herself at the palace as a servant, and
 being admitted, threw off her disguise and appeared as the goddess,
 surrounded with thunder and lightning. Striking the column with her
 wand she caused it to split open and give up the sacred coffin. This
 she seized and returned with it, and concealed it in the depth of a
 forest, but Typhon discovered it, and cutting the body into fourteen
 pieces scattered them hither and thither. After a tedious search, Isis
 found thirteen pieces, the fishes of the Nile having eaten the
 other. This she replaced by an imitation of sycamore wood, and
 buried the body at Philoe, which became ever after the great burying
 place of the nation, and the spot to which pilgrimages were made
 from all parts of the country. A temple of surpassing magnificence was
 also erected there in honour of the god, and at every place where
 one of his limbs had been found minor temples and tombs were built
 to commemorate the event. Osiris became after that the tutelar deity
 of the Egyptians. His soul was supposed always to inhabit the body
 of the bull Apis, and at his death to transfer itself to his
 successor.
 </p>
 <p>Apis, the Bull of Memphis, was worshipped with the greatest
 reverence by the Egyptians. The individual animal who was held to be
 Apis was recognized by certain signs. It was requisite that he
 should be quite black, have a white square mark on the forehead,
 another, in the form of an eagle, on his back, and under his tongue
 a lump somewhat in the shape of a scarabaeus or beetle. As soon as a
 bull thus marked was found by those sent in search of him, he was
 placed in a building facing the east, and was fed with milk for four
 months. At the expiration of this term the priests repaired at new
 moon, with great pomp, to his habitation and saluted him Apis. He
 was placed in a vessel magnificently decorated and conveyed down the
 Nile to Memphis, where a temple, with two chapels and a court for
 exercise, was assigned to him. Sacrifices were made to him, and once
 every year, about the time when the Nile began to rise, a golden cup
 was thrown into the river, and a grand festival was held to
 celebrate his birthday. The people believed that during this
 festival the crocodiles forgot their natural ferocity and became
 harmless. There was, however, one drawback to his happy lot: he was
 not permitted to live beyond a certain period, and if, when he had
 attained the age of twenty-five years, he still survived, the
 priests drowned him in the sacred cistern and then buried him in the
 temple of Serapis. On the death of this bull, whether it occurred in
 the course of nature or by violence, the whole land was filled with
 sorrow and lamentations, which lasted until his successor was found.
 </p>
 <p>We find the following item in one of the newspapers of the day:
 </p>
 <p>"The Tomb of Apis.- The excavations going on at Memphis bid fair
 to make that buried city as interesting as Pompeii. The monster tomb
 of Apis is now open, after having lain unknown for centuries."
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton, in his "Hymn on the Nativity," alludes to the Egyptian
 deities, not as imaginary beings, but as real demons, put to flight by
 the coming of Christ.
 
 </p>
           "The brutish gods of Nile as fast,<br>
            Isis and Horus and the dog Anubis haste.<br>
                Nor is Osiris seen<br>
                In Memphian grove or green<br>
            Trampling the unshowered* grass with lowings loud;<br>
                Nor can he be at rest<br>
                Within his sacred chest;<br>
            Nought but profoundest hell can be his shroud.<br>
                In vain with timbrel'd anthems dark<br>
            The sable-stoled sorcerers bear his worshipped ark."<br>
 
 <p>* There being no rain in Egypt, the grass is "unshowered," and the
 country depends for its fertility upon the overflowings of the Nile.
 The ark alluded to in the last line is shown by pictures still
 remaining on the walk of the Egyptian temple to have been borne by the
 priests in their religious processions. It probable represented the
 chest in which Osiris was placed.
 
 </p>
 <p>Isis was represented in statuary with the head veiled, a symbol of
 mystery. It is this which Tennyson alludes to in "Maud," IV. 8:
 
 </p>
 <p>"For the drift of the Maker is dark, an Isis hid by the veil," etc.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ORACLES.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Oracle was the name used to denote the place where answers were
 supposed to be given by any of the divinities to those who consulted
 them respecting the future. The word was also used to signify the
 response which was given.
 </p>
 <p>The most ancient Grecian oracle was that of Jupiter at Dodona.
 According to one account, it was established in the following
 manner: Two black doves took their flight from Thebes in Egypt. One
 flew to Dodona in Epirus, and alighting in a grove of oaks, it
 proclaimed in human language to the inhabitants of the district that
 they must establish there an oracle of Jupiter. The other dove flew to
 the temple of Jupiter Ammon in the Libyan Oasis, and delivered a
 similar command there. Another account is, that they were not doves,
 but priestesses, who were carried off from Thebes in Egypt by the
 Phoenicians, and set up oracles at the Oasis and Dodona. The responses
 of the oracle were given from the trees, by the branches rustling in
 the wind, the sounds being interpreted by the priests.
 </p>
 <p>But the most celebrated of the Grecian oracles was that of Apollo at
 Delphi, a city built on the slopes of Parnassus in Phocis.
 </p>
 <p>It had been observed at a very early period that the goats feeding
 on Parnassus were thrown into convulsions when they approached a
 certain long deep cleft in the side of the mountain. This was owing to
 a peculiar vapour arising out of the cavern, and one of the
 goatherds was induced to try its effects upon himself. Inhaling the
 intoxicating air, he was affected in the same manner as the cattle had
 been, and the inhabitants of the surrounding country, unable to
 explain the circumstance, imputed the convulsive ravings to which he
 gave utterance while under the power of the exhalations to a divine
 inspiration. The fact was speedily circulated widely, and a temple was
 erected on the spot. The prophetic influence was at first variously
 attributed to the goddess Earth, to Neptune, Themis, and others, but
 it was at length assigned to Apollo, and to him alone. A priestess was
 appointed whose office it was to inhale the hallowed air, and who
 was named the Pythia. She was prepared for this duty by previous
 ablution at the fountain of Castalia, and being crowned with laurel
 was seated upon a tripod similarly adorned, which was placed over
 the chasm whence the divine afflatus proceeded. Her inspired words
 while thus situated were interpreted by the priests.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ORACLE OF TROPHONIUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Besides the oracles of Jupiter and Apollo, at Dodona and Delphi,
 that of Trophonius in Boeotia was held in high estimation.
 Trophonius and Agamedes were brothers. They were distinguished
 architects, and built the temple of Apollo at Delphi, and a treasury
 for King Hyrieus. In the wall of the treasury they placed a stone,
 in such a manner that it could be taken out; and by this means, from
 time to time, purloined the treasure. This amazed Hyrieus, for his
 locks and seals were untouched, and yet his wealth continually
 diminished. At length he set a trap for the thief and Agamedes was
 caught.
 </p>
 <p>Trophonius, unable to extricate him, and fearing that when found
 he would be compelled by torture to discover his accomplice, cut off
 his head. Trophonius himself is said to have been shortly afterwards
 swallowed up by the earth.
 </p>
 <p>The oracle of Trophonius was at Lebadea in Boeotia. During a great
 drought the Boeotians, it is said, were directed by the god at
 Delphi to seek aid of Trophonius at Lebadea. They came thither, but
 could find no oracle. One of them, however, happening to see a swarm
 of bees, followed them to a chasm in the earth, which proved to be the
 place sought.
 </p>
 <p>Peculiar ceremonies were to be performed by the person who came to
 consult the oracle. After these preliminaries, he descended into the
 cave by a narrow passage. This place could be entered only in the
 night. The person returned from the cave by the same narrow passage,
 but walking backwards. He appeared melancholy and dejected; and
 hence the proverb which was applied to a person low-spirited and
 gloomy, "He has been consulting the oracle of Trophonius."
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ORACLE OF AESCULAPIUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>There were numerous oracles of AEsculapius, but the most
 celebrated one was at Epidaurus. Here the sick sought responses and
 the recovery of their health by sleeping in the temple. It has been
 inferred from the accounts that have come down to us that the
 treatment of the sick resembled what is now called Animal Magnetism or
 Mesmerism.
 </p>
 <p>Serpents were sacred to AEsculapius, probably because of a
 superstition that those animals have a faculty of renewing their youth
 by a change of skin.
 </p>
 <p>The worship of AEsculapius was introduced into Rome in a time of
 great sickness, and an embassy sent to the temple of Epidaurus to
 entreat the aid of the god. AEsculapius was propitious and on the
 return of the ship accompanied it in the form of a serpent. Arriving
 in the river Tiber, the serpent glided from the vessel and took
 possession of an island in the river, and a temple was there erected
 to his honour.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">ORACLE OF APIS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>At Memphis the sacred bull Apis gave answer to those who consulted
 him by the manner in which he received or rejected what was
 presented to him. If the bull refused food from the hand of the
 inquirer it was considered an unfavourable sign, and the contrary when
 he received it.
 </p>
 <p>It has been a question whether oracular responses ought to be
 ascribed to mere human contrivance or to the agency of evil spirits.
 The latter opinion has been most general in past ages. A third
 theory has been advanced since the phenomena of Mesmerism have
 attracted attention, that something like the mesmeric trance was
 induced in the Pythoness, and the faculty of clairvoyance really
 called into action.
 </p>
 <p>Another question is as to the time when the Pagan oracles ceased
 to give responses. Ancient Christian writers assert that they became
 silent at the birth of Christ, and were heard no more after that date.
 Milton adopts this view in his "Hymn on the Nativity," and in lines of
 solemn and elevated beauty pictures the consternation of the heathen
 idols at the advent of the Saviour:
 
 </p>
         "The oracles are dumb;<br>
          No voice or hideous hum<br>
            Rings through the arched roof in words deceiving.<br>
          Apollo from his shrine<br>
          Can no more divine,<br>
            With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving.<br>
          No nightly trance or breathed spell<br>
          Inspires the pale-eyed priest from the prophetic cell."<br>
 
 <p>In Cowper's poem of "Yardley Oak" there are some beautiful
 mythological allusions. The former of the two following is to the
 fable of Castor and Pollux; the latter is more appropriate to our
 present subject. Addressing the acorn he says,
 
 </p>
         "Thou fell'st mature; and in the loamy clod,<br>
          Swelling with vegetative force instinct,<br>
          Didst burst thine egg, as theirs the fabled Twins<br>
          Now stars; two lobes protruding, paired exact;<br>
          A leaf succeeded and another leaf,<br>
          And, all the elements thy puny growth<br>
          Fostering propitious, thou becam'st a twig.<br>
          Who lived when thou wast such? O, couldst thou speak,<br>
          As in Dodona once thy kindred trees<br>
          Oracular, I would not curious ask<br>
          The future, best unknown, but at thy mouth<br>
          Inquisitive, the less ambiguous past."<br>
 
 <p>Tennyson, in his "Talking Oak," alludes to the oaks of Dodona in
 these lines:
 
 </p>
           "And I will work in prose and rhyme,<br>
              And praise thee more in both<br>
            Than bard has honored beech or lime,<br>
              Or that Thessalian growth<br>
            In which the swarthy ring-dove sat<br>
              And mystic sentence spoke;" etc.<br>
 
 <p>Byron alludes to the oracle of Delphi where, speaking of Rousseau,
 whose writings he conceives did much to bring on the French
 revolution, he says,
 
 </p>
         "For then he was inspired, and from him came,<br>
            As from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,<br>
          Those oracles which set the world in flame,<br>
            Nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more."<br>
