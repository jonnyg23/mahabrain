 <h2 align="CENTER">PROSERPINE- GLAUCUS AND SCYLLA.</h2>
 
 <p>WHEN Jupiter and his brothers had defeated the Titars and banished
 them to Tartarus, a new enemy rose up against the gods. They were
 the giants Typhon, Briareus, Enceladus, and others. Some of them had a
 hundred arms, others breathed out fire. They were finally subdued
 and buried alive under Mount AEtna, where they still sometimes
 struggle to get loose, and shake the whole island with earthquakes.
 Their breath comes up through the mountain, and is what men call the
 eruption of the volcano.
 </p>
 <p>The fall of these monsters shook the earth, so that Pluto was
 alarmed, and feared that his kingdom would be laid open to the light
 of day. Under this apprehension, he mounted his chariot, drawn by
 black horses, and took a circuit of inspection to satisfy himself of
 the extent of the damage. While he was thus engaged, Venus, who was
 sitting on Mount Eryx playing with her boy Cupid, espied him, and
 said, "My son, take your darts with which you conquer all, even Jove
 himself, and send one into the breast of yonder dark monarch, who
 rules the realm of Tartarus. Why should he alone escape? Seize the
 opportunity to extend your empire and mine. Do you not see that even
 in heaven some despise our power? Minerva the wise, and Diana the
 huntress, defy us; and there is that daughter of Ceres, who
 threatens to follow their example. Now do you, if you have any
 regard for your own interest or mine, join these two in one." The
 boy unbound his quiver, and selected his sharpest and truest arrow;
 then straining the bow against his knee, he attached the string,
 and, having made ready, shot the arrow with its barbed point right
 into the heart of Pluto.
 </p>
 <p>In the vale of Enna there is a lake embowered in woods, which screen
 it from the fervid rays of the sun, while the moist ground is
 covered with flowers, and Spring reigns perpetual. Here Proserpine was
 playing with her companions, gathering lilies and violets, and filling
 her basket and her apron with them, when Pluto saw her, loved her, and
 carried her off. She screamed for help to her mother and companions;
 and when in her fright she dropped the corners of her apron and let
 the flowers fall, childlike she felt the loss of them as an addition
 to her grief. The ravisher urged on his steeds, calling them each by
 name, and throwing loose over their heads and necks his
 iron-coloured reins. When he reached the River Cyane, and it opposed
 his passage, he struck the river-bank with his trident, and the
 earth opened and gave him a passage to Tartarus.
 </p>
 <p>Ceres sought her daughter all the world over. Bright-haired
 Aurora, when she came forth in the morning, and Hesperus when he led
 out the stars in the evening, found her still busy in the search.
 But it was all unavailing. At length, weary and sad, she sat down upon
 a stone, and continued sitting nine days and nights, in the open
 air, under the sunlight and moonlight and falling showers. It was
 where now stands the city of Eleusis, then the home of an old man
 named Celeus. He was out on the field, gathering acorns and
 blackberries, and sticks for his fire. His little girl was driving
 home their two goats, and as she passed the goddess, who appeared in
 the guise of an old woman, she said to her, "Mother,"- and the name
 was sweet to the ears of Ceres,- "why do you sit here alone upon the
 rocks?" The old man also stopped, though his load was heavy, and
 begged her to come into his cottage, such as it was. She declined, and
 he urged her. "Go in peace," she replied, "and be happy in your
 daughter; I have lost mine." As she spoke, tears- or something like
 tears, for the gods never weep- fell down her cheeks upon her bosom.
 The compassionate old man and his child wept with her. Then said he,
 "Come with us, and despise not our humble roof; so may your daughter
 be restored to you in safety." "Lead on," said she, "I cannot resist
 that appeal!" So she rose from the stone and went with them. As they
 walked he told her that his only son, a little boy, lay very sick,
 feverish, and sleepless. She stooped and gathered some poppies. As
 they entered the cottage, they found all in great distress, for the
 boy seemed past hope of recovery. Metanira, his mother, received her
 kindly, and the goddess stooped and kissed the lips of the sick child.
 Instantly the paleness left his face, and healthy vigour returned to
 his body. The whole family were delighted- that is, the father,
 mother, and little girl, for they were all; they had no servants. They
 spread the table, and put upon it curds and cream, apples, and honey
 in the comb. While they ate, Ceres mingled poppy juice in the milk
 of the boy. When night came and all was still, she arose, and taking
 the sleeping boy, moulded his limbs with her hands, and uttered over
 him three times a solemn charm, then went and laid him in the ashes.
 His mother, who had been watching what her guest was doing, sprang
 forward with a cry and snatched the child from the fire. Then Ceres
 assumed her own form, and a divine splendour shone all around. While
 they were overcome with astonishment, she said, "Mother, you have been
 cruel in your fondness to your son. I would have made him immortal,
 but you have frustrated my attempt. Nevertheless, he shall be great
 and useful. He shall teach men the use of the plough, and the
 rewards which labour can win from the cultivated soil." So saying, she
 wrapped a cloud about her, and mounting her chariot rode away.
 </p>
 <p>Ceres continued her search for her daughter, passing from land to
 land, and across seas and rivers, till at length she returned to
 Sicily, whence she at first set out, and stood by the banks of the
 River Cyane, where Pluto made himself a passage with his prize to
 his own dominions. The river nymph would have told the goddess all she
 had witnessed, but dared not, for fear of Pluto; so she only
 ventured to take up the girdle which Proserpine had dropped in her
 flight, and waft it to the feet of the mother. Ceres, seeing this, was
 no longer in doubt of her loss, but she did not yet know the cause,
 and laid the blame on the innocent land. "Ungrateful soil," said
 she, "which I have endowed with fertility and clothed with herbage and
 nourishing grain, no more shall you enjoy my favours." Then the cattle
 died, the plough broke in the furrow, the seed failed to come up;
 there was too much sun, there was too much rain; the birds stole the
 seeds- thistles and brambles were the only growth. Seeing this, the
 fountain Arethusa interceded for the land. "Goddess," said she, "blame
 not the land; it opened unwillingly to yield a passage to your
 daughter. I can tell you of her fate, for I have seen her. This is not
 my native country; I came hither from Elis. I was a woodland nymph,
 and delighted in the chase. They praised my beauty, but I cared
 nothing for it, and rather boasted of my hunting exploits. One day I
 was returning from the wood, heated with exercise, when I came to a
 stream silently flowing, so clear that you might count the pebbles
 on the bottom. The willows shaded it, and the grassy bank sloped
 down to the water's edge. I approached, I touched the water with my
 foot. I stepped in knee-deep, and not content with that, I laid my
 garments on the willows and went in. While I sported in the water, I
 heard an indistinct murmur coming up as out of the depths of the
 stream; and made haste to escape to the nearest bank. The voice
 said, 'Why do you fly, Arethusa? I am Alpheus, the god of this
 stream.' I ran, he pursued; he was not more swift than I, but he was
 stronger, and gained upon me, as my strength failed. At last,
 exhausted, I cried for help to Diana. 'Help me, goddess! help your
 votary!' The goddess heard, and wrapped me suddenly in a thick
 cloud. The river god looked now this way and now that, and twice
 came close to me, but could not find me. 'Arethusa! Arethusa!' he
 cried. Oh, how I trembled,- like a lamb that hears the wolf growling
 outside the fold. A cold sweat came over me, my hair flowed down in
 streams; where my foot stood there was a pool. In short, in less
 time than it takes to tell it, I became a fountain. But in this form
 Alpheus knew me and attempted to mingle his stream with mine. Diana
 cleft the ground, and I, endeavouring to escape him, plunged into
 the cavern, and through the bowels of the earth came out here in
 Sicily. While I passed through the lower parts of the earth, I saw
 your Proserpine. She was sad, but no longer showing alarm in her
 countenance. Her look was such as became a queen- the queen of Erebus;
 the powerful bride of the monarch of the realms of the dead."
 </p>
 <p>When Ceres heard this, she stood for a while like one stupefied;
 then turned her chariot towards heaven, and hastened to present
 herself before the throne of Jove. She told the story of her
 bereavement, and implored Jupiter to interfere to procure the
 restitution of her daughter. Jupiter consented on one condition,
 namely, that Proserpine should not during her stay in the lower
 world have taken any food; otherwise, the Fates forbade her release.
 Accordingly, Mercury was sent, accompanied by Spring, to demand
 Proserpine of Pluto. The wily monarch consented; but, alas! the maiden
 had taken a pomegranate which Pluto offered her, and had sucked the
 sweet pulp from a few of the seeds. This was enough to prevent her
 complete release; but a compromise was made, by which she was to
 pass half the time with her mother, and the rest with her husband
 Pluto.
 </p>
 <p>Ceres allowed herself to be pacified with this arrangement, and
 restored the earth to her favour. Now she remembered Celeus and his
 family, and her promise to his infant son Triptolemus. When the boy
 grew up, she taught him the use of the plough, and how to sow the
 seed. She took him in her chariot, drawn by winged dragons, through
 all the countries of the earth, imparting to mankind valuable
 grains, and the knowledge of agriculture. After his return,
 Triptolemus built a magnificent temple to Ceres in Eleusis, and
 established the worship of the goddess, under the name of the
 Eleusinian mysteries, which, in the splendour and solemnity of their
 observance, surpassed all other religious celebrations among the
 Greeks.
 </p>
 <p>There can be little doubt of this story of Ceres and Proserpine
 being an allegory. Proserpine signifies the seed-corn which when
 cast into the ground lies there concealed- that is, she is carried off
 by the god of the underworld. It reappears- that is, Proserpine is
 restored to her mother. Spring leads her back to the light of day.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton alludes to the story of Proserpine in "Paradise Lost," Book
 IV.:
 
 </p>
                           "...Not that fair field<br>
              Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers,<br>
              Herself a fairer flower, by gloomy Dis<br>
              Was gathered, which cost Ceres all that pain<br>
              To seek her through the world,-<br>
              ...might with this Paradise<br>
              Of Eden strive."<br>
 
 <p>Hood, in his "Ode to Melancholy," uses the same allusion very
 beautifully:
 
 </p>
               "Forgive, if somewhile I forget,<br>
                  In woe to come the present bliss;<br>
                As frighted Proserpine let fall<br>
                  Her flowers at the sight of Dis."<br>
 
 <p>The River Alpheus does in fact disappear underground, in part of its
 course, finding its way through subterranean channels till it again
 appears on the surface. It was said that the Sicilian fountain
 Arethusa was the same stream, which, after passing under the sea, came
 up again in Sicily. Hence the story ran that a cup thrown into the
 Alpheus appeared again in Arethusa. It is this fable of the
 underground course of Alpheus that Coleridge alludes to in his poem of
 "Kubla Khan":
 
 </p>
               "In Xanadu did Kubla Khan<br>
                  A stately pleasure-dome decree,<br>
                Where Alph, the sacred river, ran<br>
                Through caverns measureless to man,<br>
                  Down to a sunless sea."<br>
 
 <p>In one of Moore's juvenile poems he thus alludes to the same
 story, and to the practice of throwing garlands or other light objects
 on his stream to be carried downward by it, and afterwards
 reproduced at its emerging:
 
 </p>
             "O my beloved, how divinely sweet<br>
              Is the pure joy when kindred spirits meet!<br>
              Like him the river god, whose waters flow,<br>
              With love their only light, through caves below,<br>
              Wafting in triumph all the flowery braids<br>
              And festal rings, with which Olympic maids<br>
              Have decked his current, as an offering meet<br>
              To lay at Arethusa's shining feet.<br>
              Think, when he meets at last his fountain bride,<br>
              What perfect love must thrill the blended tide!<br>
              Each lost in each, till mingling into one,<br>
              Their lot the same for shadow or for sun,<br>
              A type of true love, to the deep they run."<br>
 
 <p>The following extract from Moore's "Rhymes on the Road" gives an
 account of a celebrated picture by Albano, at Milan, called a Dance of
 Loves:
 
 </p>
           "'Tis for the theft of Enna's flower from earth<br>
            These urchins celebrate their dance of mirth,<br>
              Round the green tree, like fays upon a heath;-<br>
                Those that are nearest Linked in order bright,<br>
              Cheek after cheek, like rosebuds in a wreath;<br>
              And those more distant showing from beneath<br>
                The others' wings their little eyes of light.<br>
            While see! among the clouds, their eldest brother,<br>
              But just flown up, tells with a smile of bliss,<br>
            This prank of Pluto to his charmed mother,<br>
                Who turns to greet the tidings with a kiss."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">GLAUCUS AND SCYLLA.</h3>
 
 <p>Glaucus was a fisherman. One day he had drawn his nets to land,
 and had taken a great many fishes of various kinds. So he emptied
 his net, and. proceeded to sort the fishes on the grass. The place
 where he stood was a beautiful island in the river, a solitary spot,
 uninhabited, and not used for pasturage of cattle, not ever visited by
 any but himself. On a sudden, the fishes, which had been laid on the
 grass, began to revive and move their fins as if they were in the
 water; and while he looked on astonished, they one and all moved off
 to the water, plunged in, and swam away. He did not know what to
 make of this, whether some god had done it or some secret power in the
 herbage. "What herb has such a power?" he exclaimed; and gathering
 some of it, he tasted it. Scarce had the juices of the plant reached
 his palate when he found himself agitated with a longing desire for
 the water. He could no longer restrain himself, but bidding farewell
 to earth, he plunged into the stream. The gods of the water received
 him graciously, and admitted him to the honour of their society.
 They obtained the consent of Oceanus and Tethys, the sovereigns of the
 sea, that all that was mortal in him should be washed away. A
 hundred rivers poured their waters over him. Then he lost all sense of
 his former nature and all consciousness. When he recovered, he found
 himself changed in form and mind. His hair was sea-green, and
 trailed behind him on the water; his shoulders grew broad, and what
 had been thighs and legs assumed the form of a fish's tail. The
 sea-gods complimented him on the change of his appearance, and he
 fancied himself rather a good-looking personage.
 </p>
 <p>One day Glaucus saw the beautiful maiden Scylla, the favourite of
 the water-nymphs, rambling on the shore, and when she had found a
 sheltered nook, laving her limbs in the clear water. He fell in love
 with her, and showing himself on the surface, spoke to her, saying
 such things as he thought most likely to win her to stay; for she
 turned to run immediately on the sight of him, and ran till she had
 gained a cliff overlooking the sea. Here she stopped and turned
 round to see whether it was a god or a sea animal, and observed with
 wonder his shape and colour. Glaucus partly emerging from the water,
 and supporting himself against a rock, said, "Maiden, I am no monster,
 nor a sea animal, but a god: and neither Proteus nor Triton ranks
 higher than I. Once I was a mortal, and followed the sea for a living;
 but now I belong wholly to it." Then he told the story of his
 metamorphosis, and how he had been promoted to his present dignity,
 and added, "But what avails all this if it fails to move your
 heart?" He was going on in this strain, but Scylla turned and hastened
 away.
 </p>
 <p>Glaucus was in despair, but it occurred to him to consult the
 enchantress Circe. Accordingly he repaired to her island- the same
 where afterwards Ulysses landed, as we shall see in one of our later
 stories. After mutual salutations, he said, "Goddess, I entreat your
 pity; you alone can relieve the pain I suffer. The power of herbs I
 know as well as any one, for it is to them I owe my change of form.
 I love Scylla. I am ashamed to tell you how I have sued and promised
 to her, and how scornfully she has treated me. I beseech you to use
 your incantations, or potent herbs, if they are more prevailing, not
 to cure me of my love,- for that I do not wish,- but to make her share
 it and yield me a like return." To which Circe replied, for she was
 not insensible to the attractions of the sea-green deity, "You had
 better pursue a willing object; you are worthy to be sought, instead
 of having to seek in vain. Be not diffident, know your own worth. I
 protest to you that even I, goddess though I be, and learned in the
 virtues of plants and spells, should not know how to refuse you. If
 she scorns you scorn her; meet one who is ready to meet you half
 way, and thus make a due return to both at once." To these words
 Glaucus replied, "Sooner shall trees grow at the bottom of the
 ocean, and sea-weed on the top of the mountains, than I will cease
 to love Scylla, and her alone."
 </p>
 <p>The goddess was indignant, but she could not punish him, neither did
 she wish to do so, for she liked him too well; so she turned all her
 wrath against her rival, poor Scylla. She took plants of poisonous
 powers and mixed them together, with incantations and charms. Then she
 passed through the crowd of gambolling beasts, the victims of her art,
 and proceeded to the coast of Sicily, where Scylla lived. There was
 a little bay on the shore to which Scylla used to resort, in the
 heat of the day, to breathe the air of the sea, and to bathe in its
 waters. Here the goddess poured her poisonous mixture, and muttered
 over it incantations of mighty power. Scylla came as usual and plunged
 into the water up to her waist. What was her horror to perceive a
 brood of serpents and barking monsters surrounding her! At first she
 could not imagine they were a part of herself, and tried to run from
 them, and to drive them away; but as she ran she carried them with
 her, and when she tried to touch her limbs, she found her hands
 touch only the yawning jaws of monsters. Scylla remained rooted to the
 spot. Her temper grew as ugly as her form, and she took pleasure in
 devouring hapless mariners who came within her grasp. Thus she
 destroyed six of the companions of Ulysses, and tried to wreck the
 ships of AEneas, till at last she was turned into a rock, and as
 such still continues to be a terror to mariners.
 
 </p>
 <p>Keats, in his "Endymion," has given a new version of the ending of
 "Glaucus and Scylla." Glaucus consents to Circe's blandishments,
 till he by chance is witness to her transactions with her beasts.
 Disgusted with her treachery and cruelty, he tries to escape from her,
 but is taken and brought back, when with reproaches she banishes
 him, sentencing him to pass a thousand years in decrepitude and
 pain. He returns to the sea, and there finds the body of Scylla,
 whom the goddess has not transformed but drowned. Glaucus learns
 that his destiny is that, if he passes his thousand years in
 collecting all the bodies of drowned lovers, a youth beloved of the
 gods will appear and help him. Endymion fulfils this prophecy, and
 aids in restoring Glaucus to youth, and Scylla and all the drowned
 lovers to life.
 </p>
 <p>The following is Glaucus's account of his feelings after his
 "sea-change":
 
 </p>
             "I plunged for life or death. To interknit<br>
              One's senses with so dense a breathing stuff<br>
              Might seem a work of pain; so not enough<br>
              Can I admire how crystal-smooth it felt,<br>
              And buoyant round my limbs. At first I dwelt<br>
              Whole days and days in sheer astonishment;<br>
              Forgetful utterly of self-intent,<br>
              Moving but with the mighty ebb and flow.<br>
              Then like a new-fledged bird that first doth show<br>
              His spreaded feathers to the morrow chill,<br>
              I tried in fear the pinions of my will.<br>
              'Twas freedom! and at once I visited<br>
              The ceaseless wonders of his ocean-bed,"<br>
                                                    etc.- Keats.<br>
