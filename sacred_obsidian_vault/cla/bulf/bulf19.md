 <h2 align="CENTER">THESEUS- DAEDALUS- CASTOR AND POLLUX.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THESEUS</h3>
 
 
 <p>THESEUS was the son of AEgeus, king of Athens, and of AEthra,
 daughter of the king of Troezen. He was brought up at Troezen, and
 when arrived at manhood was to proceed to Athens and present himself
 to his father. AEgeus on parting from AEthra, before the birth of
 his son, placed his sword and shoes under a large stone and directed
 her to send his son to him when he became strong enough to roll away
 the stone and take them from under it. When she thought the time had
 come, his mother led Theseus to the stone, and he removed it with ease
 and took the sword and shoes. As the roads were infested with robbers,
 his grandfather pressed him earnestly to take the shorter and safer
 way to his father's country- by sea; but the youth, feeling in himself
 the spirit and the soul of a hero, and eager to signalize himself like
 Hercules, with whose fame all Greece then rang, by destroying the
 evil-doers and monsters that oppressed the country, determined on
 the more perilous and adventurous journey by land.
 </p>
 <p>His first day's journey brought him to Epidaurus, where dwelt a
 man named Periphetes, a son of Vulcan. This ferocious savage always
 went armed with a club of iron, and all travellers stood in terror
 of his violence. When he saw Theseus approach he assailed him, but
 speedily fell beneath the blows of the young hero, who took possession
 of his club and bore it ever afterwards as a memorial of his first
 victory.
 </p>
 <p>Several similar contests with the petty tyrants and marauders of the
 country followed, in all of which Theseus was victorious. One of these
 evil-doers was called Procrustes, or the Stretcher. He had an iron
 bedstead, on which he used to tie all travellers who fell into his
 hands. If they were shorter than the bed, he stretched their limbs
 to make them fit it; if they were longer than the bed, he lopped off a
 portion. Theseus served him as he had served others.
 </p>
 <p>Having overcome all the perils of the road, Theseus at length
 reached Athens, where new dangers awaited him. Medea, the sorceress,
 who had fled from Corinth after her separation from Jason, had
 become the wife of AEgeus, the father of Theseus. Knowing by her
 arts who he was, and fearing the loss of her influence with her
 husband if Theseus should be acknowledged as his son, she filled the
 mind of AEgeus with suspicions of the young stranger, and induced
 him to present him a cup of poison; but at the moment when Theseus
 stepped forward to take it, the sight of the sword which he wore
 discovered to his father who he was, and prevented the fatal
 draught. Medea, detected in her arts, fled once more from deserved
 punishment, and arrived in Asia, where the country afterwards called
 Media, received its name from her. Theseus was acknowledged by his
 father, and declared his successor.
 </p>
 <p>The Athenians were at that time in deep affliction, on account of
 the tribute which they were forced to pay to Minos, king of Crete.
 This tribute consisted of seven youths and seven maidens, who were
 sent every year to be devoured by the Minotaur, a monster with a
 bull's body and a human head. It was exceedingly strong and fierce,
 and was kept in a labyrinth constructed by Daedalus, so artfully
 contrived that whoever was enclosed in it could by no means find his
 way out unassisted. Here the Minotaur roamed, and was fed with human
 victims.
 </p>
 <p>Theseus resolved to deliver his countrymen from this calamity, or to
 die in the attempt. Accordingly, when the time of sending off the
 tribute came, and the youths and maidens were, according to custom,
 drawn by lot to be sent, he offered himself as one of the victims,
 in spite of the entreaties of his father. The ship departed under
 black sails, as usual, which Theseus promised his father to change for
 white, in case of his returning victorious. When they arrived in
 Crete, the youths and maidens were exhibited before Minos; and
 Ariadne, the daughter of the king, being present, became deeply
 enamoured of Theseus, by whom her love was readily returned. She
 furnished him with a sword, with which to encounter the Minotaur,
 and with a clue of thread by which he might find his way out of the
 labyrinth. He was successful, slew the Minotaur, escaped from the
 labyrinth, and taking Ariadne as the companion of his way, with his
 rescued companions sailed for Athens. On their way they stopped at the
 island of Naxos, where Theseus abandoned Ariadne, leaving her asleep.*
 His excuse for this ungrateful treatment of his benefactress was
 that Minerva appeared to him in a dream and commanded him to do so.
 
 </p>
 <p>* One of the finest pieces of sculpture in Italy, the recumbent
 Ariadne of the Vatican, represents this incident. A copy is in the
 Athenaeum gallery, Boston.
 
 </p>
 <p>On approaching the coast of Attica, Theseus forgot the signal
 appointed by his father, and neglected to raise the white sails, and
 the old king, thinking his son had perished, put an end to his own
 life. Theseus thus became king of Athens.
 </p>
 <p>One of the most celebrated of the adventures of Theseus is his
 expedition against the Amazons. He assailed them before they had
 recovered from the attack of Hercules, and carried off their queen
 Antiope. The Amazons in their turn invaded the country of Athens and
 penetrated into the city itself; and the final battle in which Theseus
 overcame them was fought in the very midst of the city. This battle
 was one of the favourite subjects of the ancient sculptors, and is
 commemorated in several works of art that are still extant.
 </p>
 <p>The friendship between Theseus and Pirithous was of a most
 intimate nature, yet it originated in the midst of arms. Pirithous had
 made an irruption into the plain of Marathon, and carried off the
 herds of the king of Athens. Theseus went to repel the plunderers. The
 moment Pirithous beheld him, he was seized with admiration; he
 stretched out his hand as a token of peace, and cried, "Be judge
 thyself- what satisfaction dost thou require?" "Thy friendship,"
 replied the Athenian, and they swore inviolable fidelity. Their
 deeds corresponded to their professions, and they ever continued
 true brothers in arms. Each of them aspired to espouse a daughter of
 Jupiter. Theseus fixed his choice on Helen, then but a child,
 afterwards so celebrated as the cause of the Trojan war, and with
 the aid of his friend he carried her off. Pirithous aspired to the
 wife of the monarch of Erebus; and Theseus, though aware of the
 danger, accompanied the ambitious lover in his descent to the
 underworld. But Pluto seized and set them on an enchanted rock at
 his palace gate, where they remained till Hercules arrived and
 liberated Theseus, leaving Pirithous to his fate.
 </p>
 <p>After the death of Antiope, Theseus married Phaedra, daughter of
 Minos, king of Crete. Phaedra saw in Hippolytus, the son of Theseus, a
 youth endowed with all the graces and virtues of his father, and of an
 age corresponding to her own. She loved him, but he repulsed her
 advances, and her love was changed to hate. She used her influence
 over her infatuated husband to cause him to be jealous of his son, and
 he imprecated the vengeance of Neptune upon him. As Hippolytus was one
 day driving his chariot along the shore, a sea-monster raised
 himself above the waters, and frightened the horses so that they ran
 away and dashed the chariot to pieces. Hippolytus was killed, but by
 Diana's assistance AEsculapius restored him to life. Diana removed
 Hippolytus from the power of his deluded father and false
 stepmother, and placed him in Italy under the protection of the
 nymph Egeria.
 </p>
 <p>Theseus at length lost the favour of his people, and retired to
 the court of Lycomedes, king of Scyros, who at first received him
 kindly, but afterwards treacherously slew him. In a later age the
 Athenian general Cimon discovered the place where his remains were
 laid, and caused them to be removed to Athens, where they were
 deposited in a temple called the Theseum, erected in honour of the
 hero.
 </p>
 <p>The queen of the Amazons whom Theseus espoused is by some called
 Hippolyta. That is the name she bears in Shakespeare's "Midsummer
 Night's Dream,"- the subject of which is the festivities attending the
 nuptials of Theseus and Hippolyta.
 </p>
 <p>Mrs. Hemans has a poem on the ancient Greek tradition that the
 "Shade of Theseus" appeared strengthening his countrymen at the battle
 of Marathon.
 </p>
 <p>Theseus is a semi-historical personage. It is recorded of him that
 he united the several tribes by whom the territory of Attica was
 then possessed into one state, of which Athens was the capital. In
 commemoration of this important event, he instituted the festival of
 Panathenaea, in honour of Minerva, the patron deity of Athens. This
 festival differed from the other Grecian games chiefly in two
 particulars. It was peculiar to the Athenians, and its chief feature
 was a solemn procession in which the Peplus, or sacred robe of
 Minerva, was carried to the Parthenon, and suspended be, fore the
 statue of the goddess. The Peplus was covered with embroidery,
 worked by select virgins of the noblest families in Athens. The
 procession consisted of persons of all ages and both sexes. The old
 men carried olive branches in their hands, and the young men bore
 arms. The young women carried baskets on their heads, containing the
 sacred utensils, cakes, and all things necessary for the sacrifices.
 The procession formed the subject of the bas-reliefs which embellished
 the outside of the temple of the Parthenon. A considerable portion
 of these sculptures is now in the British Museum among those known
 as the "Elgin marbles."
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OLYMPIC AND OTHER GAMES.</h3>
 
 
 <p>It seems not inappropriate to mention here the other celebrated
 national games of the Greeks. The first and most distinguished were
 the Olympic, founded, it was said, by Jupiter himself. They were
 celebrated at Olympia in Elis. Vast numbers of spectators flocked to
 them from every part of Greece, and from Asia, Africa and Sicily. They
 were repeated every fifth year in midsummer, and continued five
 days. They gave rise to the custom of reckoning time and dating events
 by Olympiads. The first Olympiad is generally considered as
 corresponding with the year 776 B.C. The Pythian games were celebrated
 in the vicinity of Delphi, the Isthmian on the Corinthian Isthmus, the
 Nemean at Nemea, a city of Argolis.
 </p>
 <p>The exercises in these games were of five sorts: running, leaping,
 wrestling, throwing the quoit, and hurling the javelin, or boxing.
 Besides these exercises of bodily strength and agility there were
 contests in music, poetry and eloquence. Thus these games furnished
 poets, musicians and authors the best opportunities to present their
 productions to the public, and the fame of the victors was diffused
 far and wide.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">DAEDALUS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The labyrinth from which Theseus escaped by means of the clew of
 Ariadne was built by Daedalus, a most skilful artificer. It was an
 edifice with numberless winding passages and turnings opening into one
 another, and seeming to have neither beginning nor end, like the river
 Maeander, which returns on itself, and flows now onward, now backward,
 in its course to the sea. Daedalus built the labyrinth for King Minos,
 but afterwards lost the favour of the king, and was shut up in a
 tower. He contrived to make his escape from his prison, but could
 not leave the island by sea, as the king kept strict watch on all
 the vessels, and permitted none to sail without being carefully
 searched. "Minos may control the land and sea," said Daedalus, "but
 not the regions of the air. I will try that way." So he set to work to
 fabricate wings for himself and his young son Icarus. He wrought
 feathers together, beginning with the smallest and adding larger, so
 as to form an increasing surface. The larger ones he secured with
 thread and the smaller with wax, and gave the whole a gentle curvature
 like the wings of a bird. Icarus, the boy, stood and looked on,
 sometimes running to gather up the feathers which the wind had blown
 away, and then handling the wax and working it over with his
 fingers, by his play impeding his father in his labours. When at
 last the work was done, the artist, waving his wings, found himself
 buoyed upward, and hung suspended, poising himself on the beaten
 air. He next equipped his son in the same manner and taught him how to
 fly, as a bird tempts her young ones from the lofty nest into the air.
 When all was prepared for flight he said, "Icarus, my son, I charge
 you to keep at a moderate height, for if you fly too low the damp will
 clog your wings, and if too high the heat will melt them. Keep near me
 and you will be safe." While he gave him these instructions and fitted
 the wings to his shoulders, the face of the father was wet with tears,
 and his hands trembled. He kissed the boy, not knowing that it was for
 the last time. Then rising on his wings, he flew off, encouraging
 him to follow, and looked back from his own flight to see how his
 son managed his wings. As they flew the ploughman stopped his work
 to gaze, aid the shepherd leaned on his staff and watched them,
 astonished at the sight, and thinking they were gods who could thus
 cleave the air.
 </p>
 <p>They passed Samos and Delos on the left and Lebynthos on the
 right, when the boy, exulting in his career, began to leave the
 guidance of his companion and soar upward as if to reach heaven. The
 nearness of the blazing sun softened the wax which held the feathers
 together, and they came off. He fluttered with his arms, but no
 feathers remained to hold the air. While his mouth uttered cries to
 his father it was submerged in the blue waters of the sea which
 thenceforth was called by his name. His father cried, "Icarus, Icarus,
 where are you?" At last he saw the feathers floating on the water, and
 bitterly lamenting his own arts, he buried the body and called the
 land Icaria in memory of his child. Daedalus arrived safe in Sicily,
 where he built a temple to Apollo, and hung up his wings, an
 offering to the god.
 </p>
 <p>Daedalus was so proud of his achievements that he could not bear the
 idea of a rival. His sister had placed her son Perdix under his charge
 to be taught the mechanical arts. He was an apt scholar and gave
 striking evidences of ingenuity. Walking on the seashore he picked
 up the spine of a fish. Imitating it, he took a piece of iron and
 notched it on the edge, and thus invented the saw. He, put two
 pieces of iron together, connecting them at one end with a rivet,
 and sharpening the other ends, and made a pair of compasses.
 Daedalus was so envious of his nephew's performances that he took an
 opportunity, when they were together one day on the top of a high
 tower to push him off. But Minerva, who favours ingenuity, saw him
 falling, and arrested his fate by changing him into a bird called
 after his name, the Partridge. This bird does not build his nest in
 the trees, nor take lofty flights, but nestles in the hedges, and
 mindful of his fall, avoids high places.
 
 </p>
 <p>The death of Icarus is told in the following lines by Darwin:
 
 </p>
           "...with melting wax and loosened strings<br>
            Sunk hapless Icarus on unfaithful wings;<br>
            Headlong he rushed through the affrighted air,<br>
            With limbs distorted and dishevelled hair;<br>
            His scattered plumage danced upon the wave,<br>
            And sorrowing Nereids decked his watery grave;<br>
            O'er his pale corse their pearly sea-flowers shed,<br>
            And strewed with crimson moss his marble bed;<br>
            Struck in their coral towers the passing bell,<br>
            And wide in ocean tolled his echoing knell."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">CASTOR AND POLLUX.</h3>
 
 <p>Castor and Pollux were the offspring of Leda and the Swan, under
 which disguise Jupiter had concealed himself. Leda gave, birth to an
 egg from which sprang the twins. Helen, so famous afterwards as the
 cause of the Trojan war, was their sister.
 </p>
 <p>When Theseus and his friend Pirithous had carried off Helen from
 Sparta, the youthful heroes, Castor and Pollux, with their
 followers, hastened to her rescue. Theseus was absent from Attica
 and the brothers were successful in recovering their sister.
 </p>
 <p>Castor was famous for taming and managing horses, and Pollux for
 skill in boxing. They were united by the warmest affection and
 inseparable in all their enterprises. They accompanied the
 Argonautic expedition. During the voyage a storm arose, and Orpheus
 prayed to the Samothracian gods, and played on his harp, whereupon the
 storm ceased and stars appeared on the heads of the brothers. From
 this incident, Castor and Pollux came afterwards to be considered
 the patron deities of seamen and voyagers, and the lambent flames,
 which in certain states of the atmosphere play round the sails and
 masts of vessels, were called by their names.
 </p>
 <p>After the Argonautic expedition, we find Castor and Pollux engaged
 in a war with Idas and Lynceus. Castor was slain, and Pollux,
 inconsolable for the loss of his brother, besought Jupiter to be
 permitted to give his own life as a ransom for him. Jupiter so far
 consented as to allow the two brothers to enjoy the boon of life
 alternately, passing one day under the earth and the next in the
 heavenly abodes. According to another form of the story, Jupiter
 rewarded the attachment of the brothers by placing them among the
 stars as Gemini the Twins.
 </p>
 <p>They received divine honours under the name of Dioscuri (sons of
 Jove). They were believed to have appeared occasionally in later
 times, taking part with one side or the other, in hard-fought
 fields, and were said on such occasions to be mounted on magnificent
 white steeds. Thus in the early history of Rome they are said to
 have assisted the Romans at the battle of Lake Regillus, and after the
 victory a temple was erected in their honour on the spot where they
 appeared.
 
 </p>
 <p>Macaulay, in his "Lays of Ancient Rome," thus alludes to the legend:
 
 </p>
               "So like they were, no mortal<br>
                  Might one from other know;<br>
                White as snow their armour was,<br>
                  Their steeds were white as snow.<br>
                Never on earthly anvil<br>
                  Did such rare armour gleam,<br>
                And never did such gallant steeds<br>
                  Drink of an earthly stream.<br>
 
               "Back comes the chief in triumph<br>
                  Who in the hour of fight<br>
                Hath seen the great twin Brethren<br>
                  In harness on his right.<br>
                Safe comes the ship to haven,<br>
                  Through billows and through gales,<br>
                If once the great Twin Brethren<br>
                  Sit shining on the sails."<br>
