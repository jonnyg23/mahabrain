 <h2 align="CENTER">PHAETON.</h2>
 
 <p>PHAETON was the son of Apollo and the nymph Clymene. One day a
 schoolfellow laughed at the idea of his being the son of the god,
 and Phaeton went in rage and shame and reported it to his mother.
 "If," said he, "I am indeed of heavenly birth, give me, mother, some
 proof of it, and establish my claim to the honour." Clymene
 stretched forth her hands towards the skies, and said, "I call to
 witness the Sun which looks down upon us, that I have told you the
 truth. If I speak falsely, let this be the last time I behold his
 light. But it needs not much labour to go and inquire for yourself;
 the land whence the Sun rises lies next to ours. Go and demand of
 him whether he will own you as a son." Phaeton heard with delight.
 He travelled to India, which lies directly in the regions of
 sunrise; and, full of hope and pride, approached the goal whence his
 parent begins his course.
 </p>
 <p>The palace of the Sun stood reared aloft on columns, glittering with
 gold and precious stones, while polished ivory formed the ceilings,
 and silver the doors. The workmanship surpassed the material;* for
 upon the walls Vulcan had represented earth, sea, and skies, with
 their inhabitants. In the sea were the nymphs, some sporting in the
 waves, some riding on the backs of fishes, while others sat upon the
 rocks and dried their sea-green hair. Their faces were not all
 alike, nor yet unlike,- but such as sisters' ought to be.*(2) The
 earth had its towns and forests and rivers and rustic divinities. Over
 all was carved the likeness of the glorious heaven; and on the
 silver doors the twelve signs of the zodiac, six on each side.

 <p>Clymene's son advanced up the steep ascent, and entered the halls of
 his disputed father. He approached the paternal presence, but
 stopped at a distance, for the light was more than he could bear.
 Phoebus, arrayed in a purple vesture, sat on a throne, which glittered
 as with diamonds. On his right hand and his left stood the Day, the
 Month, and the Year, and, at regular intervals, the Hours. Spring
 stood with her head crowned with flowers, and Summer, with garment
 cast aside, and a garland formed of spears of ripened grain, and
 Autumn, with his feet stained with grape-juice, and icy Winter, with
 his hair stiffened with hoar frost. Surrounded by these attendants,
 the Sun, with the eye that sees everything, beheld the youth dazzled
 with the novelty and splendour of the scene, and inquired the
 purpose of his errand. The youth replied, "O light of the boundless
 world, Phoebus, my father,- if you permit me to use that name,- give
 me some proof, I beseech you, by which I may be known as yours." He
 ceased; and his father, laying aside the beams that shone all around
 his head, bade him approach, and embracing him, said, "My son, you
 deserve not to be disowned, and I confirm what your mother has told
 you. To put an end to your doubts, ask what you will, the gift shall
 be yours. I call to witness that dreadful lake, which I never saw, but
 which we gods swear by in our most solemn engagements." Phaeton
 immediately asked to be permitted for one day to drive the chariot
 of the sun. The father repented of his promise; thrice and four
 times he shook his radiant head in warning. "I have spoken rashly,"
 said he; "this only request I would fain deny. I beg you to withdraw
 it. It is not a safe boon, nor one, my Phaeton, suited to your youth
 and strength, Your lot is mortal, and you ask what is beyond a
 mortal's power. In your ignorance you aspire to do that which not even
 the gods themselves may do. None but myself may drive the flaming
 car of day. Not even Jupiter, whose terrible right arm hurls the
 thunderbolts. The first part of the way is steep, and such as the
 horses when fresh in the morning can hardly climb; the middle is
 high up in the heavens, whence I myself can scarcely, without alarm,
 look down and behold the earth and sea stretched beneath me. The
 last part of the road descends rapidly, and requires most careful
 driving. Tethys, who is waiting to receive me, often trembles for me
 lest I should fall headlong. Add to all this, the heaven is all the
 time turning round and carrying the stars with it. I have to be
 perpetually on my guard lest that movement, which sweeps everything
 else along, should hurry me also away. Suppose I should lend you the
 chariot, what would you do? Could you keep your course while the
 sphere was revolving under you? Perhaps you think that there are
 forests and cities, the abodes of gods, and palaces and temples on the
 way. On the contrary, the road is through the midst of frightful
 monsters. You pass by the horns of the Bull, in front of the Archer,
 and near the Lion's jaws, and where the Scorpion stretches its arms in
 one direction and the Crab in another. Nor will you find it easy to
 guide those horses, with their breasts full of fire that they
 breathe forth from their mouths and nostrils. I can scarcely govern
 them myself, when they are unruly and resist the reins. Beware, my
 son, lest I be the donor of a fatal gift; recall your request while
 yet you may. Do you ask me for a proof that you are sprung from my
 blood? I give you a proof in my fears for you. Look at my face- I
 would that you could look into my breast, you would there see all a
 father's anxiety. Finally," he continued, "look round the world and
 choose whatever you will of what earth or sea contains most
 precious- ask it and fear no refusal. This only I pray you not to
 urge. It is not honour, but destruction you seek. Why do you hang
 round my neck and still entreat me? You shall have it if you persist,-
 the oath is sworn and must be kept,- but I beg you to choose more
 wisely."
 </p>
 <p>He ended; but the youth rejected all admonition and held to his
 demand. So, having resisted as long as he could, Phoebus at last led
 the way to where stood the lofty chariot.
 </p>
 <p>It was of gold, the gift of Vulcan; the axle was of gold, the pole
 and wheels of gold, the spokes of silver. Along the seat were rows
 of chrysolites and diamonds which reflected all around the
 brightness of the sun. While the daring youth gazed in admiration, the
 early Dawn threw open the purple doors of the east, and showed the
 pathway strewn with roses. The stars withdrew, marshalled by the
 Day-star, which last of all retired also. The father, when he saw
 the earth beginning to glow, and the Moon preparing to retire, ordered
 the Hours to harness up the horses. They obeyed, and led forth from
 the lofty stalls the Steeds full fed with ambrosia, and attached the
 reins. Then the father bathed the face of his son with a powerful
 unguent, and made him capable of enduring the brightness of the flame.
 He set the rays on his head, and, with a foreboding sigh, said, "If,
 my son, you will in this at least heed my advice, spare the whip and
 hold tight the reins. They go fast enough of their own accord; the
 labour is to hold them in. You are not to take the straight road
 directly between the five circles, but turn off to the left. Keep
 within the limit of the middle zone, and avoid the northern and the
 southern alike. You will see the marks of the northern and the
 southern alike. You will see the marks of the wheels, and they will
 serve to guide you. And, that the skies and the earth may each receive
 their due share of heat, go not too high, or you will burn the
 heavenly dwellings, nor too low, or you will set the earth on fire;
 the middle course is safest and best.* And now I leave you to your
 chance, which I hope will plan better for you than you have done for
 yourself. Night is passing out of the western gates and we can delay
 no longer. Take the reins; but if at last your heart fails you, and
 you will benefit by my advice, stay where you are in safety, and
 suffer me to light and warm the earth." The agile youth, sprang into
 the chariot, stood erect, and grasped the reins with delight pouring
 out thanks to his reluctant parent.

 </p>
 <p>Meanwhile the horses fill the air with their snortings and fiery
 breath, and stamp the ground impatient. Now the bars are let down, and
 the boundless plain of the universe lies open before them. They dart
 forward and cleave the opposing clouds, and outrun the morning breezes
 which started from the same eastern goal. The steeds soon perceived
 that the load they drew was lighter than usual; and as a ship
 without ballast is tossed hither and thither on the sea, so the
 chariot, without its accustomed weight, was dashed about as if
 empty. They rush headlong and leave the travelled road. He is alarmed,
 and knows not how to guide them; nor, if he knew, has he the power.
 Then, for the first time, the Great and Little Bear were scorched with
 heat, and would fain, if it were possible, have plunged into the
 water; and the Serpent which lies coiled up round the north pole,
 torpid and harmless, grew warm, and with warmth felt its rage
 revive. Bootes, they say, fled away, though encumbered with his
 plough, and all unused to rapid motion.
 </p>
 <p>When hapless Phaeton looked down upon the earth, now spreading in
 vast extent beneath him, he grew pale and his knees shook with terror.
 In spite of the glare all around him, the sight of his eyes grew
 dim. He wished he had never touched his father's horses, never learned
 his parentage, never prevailed in his request. He is borne along
 like a vessel that flies before a tempest, when the pilot can do no
 more and betakes himself to his prayers. What shall he do? Much of the
 heavenly road is left behind, but more remains before. He turns his
 eyes from one direction to the other; now to the goal whence he
 began his course, now to the realms of sunset which he is not destined
 to reach. He loses his self-command, and knows not what to do,-
 whether to draw tight the reins or throw them loose; he forgets the
 names of the horses. He sees with terror the monstrous forms scattered
 over the surface of heaven. Here the Scorpion extended his two great
 arms, with his tail and crooked claws stretching over two signs of the
 zodiac. When the boy beheld him, reeking with poison and menacing with
 his fangs, his course failed, and the reins fell from his hands. The
 horses, when they felt them loose on their backs, dashed headlong, and
 unrestrained went off into unknown regions of the sky, in among the
 stars, hurling the chariot over pathless places, now up in high
 heaven, now down almost to the earth. The moon saw with astonishment
 her brother's chariot running beneath her own. The clouds begin to
 smoke, and the mountain tops take fire; the fields are parched with
 heat, the plants wither, the trees with their leafy branches burn, the
 harvest is ablaze! But these are small things. Great cities
 perished, with their walls and towers; whole nations with their people
 were consumed to ashes! The forest-clad mountains burned, Athos and
 Taurus and Tmolus and OEte; Ida, once celebrated for fountains, but
 now all dry; the Muses' mountain Helicon, and Haemus; AEtna, with
 fires within and without, and Parnassus, with his two peaks, and
 Rhodope, forced at last to part with his snowy crown. Her cold climate
 was no protection to Scythia, Caucasus burned, and Ossa and Pindus,
 and, greater than both, Olympus; the Alps high in air, and the
 Apennines crowned with clouds.
 </p>
 <p>Then Phaeton beheld the world on fire, and felt the heat
 intolerable. The air he breathed was like the air of a furnace and
 full of burning ashes, and the smoke was of a pitchy darkness. He
 dashed forward he knew not whither. Then, it is believed, the people
 of AEthiopia became black by the blood being forced so suddenly to the
 surface, and the Libyan desert was dried up to the condition in
 which it remains to this day. The Nymphs of the fountains, with
 dishevelled hair, mourned their waters, nor were the rivers safe
 beneath their banks: Tanais smoked, and Caicus, Xanthus, and
 Meander; Babylonian Euphrates and Ganges, Tagus with golden sands, and
 Cayster where the swans resort. Nile fled away and hid his head in the
 desert, and there it still remains concealed. Where he used to
 discharge his waters through seven mouths into the sea, there seven
 dry channels alone remained. The earth cracked open, and through the
 chinks light broke into Tartarus, and frightened the king of shadows
 and his queen. The sea shrank up. Where here before was water, it
 became a dry plain; and the mountains that lie beneath the waves
 lifted up their heads and became islands. The fishes sought the lowest
 depths, and the dolphins no longer ventured as usual to sport on the
 surface. Even Nereus, and his wife Doris, with the Nereids, their
 daughters, sought the deepest caves for refuge. Thrice Neptune essayed
 to raise his head above the surface, and thrice was driven back by the
 heat. Earth, surrounded as she was by waters, yet with head and
 shoulders bare, screening her face with her hand, looked up to heaven,
 and with a husky voice called on Jupiter:
 </p>
 <p>"O ruler of the gods, if I have deserved this treatment, and it is
 your will that I perish with fire, why withhold your thunderbolts? Let
 me at least fall by your hand. Is this the reward of my fertility,
 of my obedient service? Is it for this that I have supplied herbage
 for cattle, and fruits for men, and frankincense for your altars?
 But if I am unworthy of regard, what has my brother Ocean done to
 deserve such a fate? If neither of us can excite your pity, think, I
 pray you, of your own heaven, and behold how both the poles are
 smoking which sustain your palace, which must fall if they be
 destroyed. Atlas faints, and scarce holds up his burden. If sea,
 earth, and heaven perish, we fall into ancient Chaos. Save what yet
 remains to us from the devouring flame. O, take thought for our
 deliverance in this awful moment!"
 </p>
 <p>Thus spoke Earth, and overcome with heat and thirst, could say no
 more. Then Jupiter omnipotent, calling to witness all the gods,
 including him who had lent the chariot, and showing them that all
 was lost unless some speedy remedy were applied, mounted the lofty
 tower from whence he diffuses clouds over the earth, and hurls the
 forked lightnings. But at that time not a cloud was to be found to
 interpose for a screen to earth, nor was a shower remaining
 unexhausted. He thundered, and brandishing a lightning bolt in his
 right hand launched it against the charioteer, and struck him at the
 same moment from his seat and from existence! Phaeton, with his hair
 on fire, fell headlong, like a shooting star which marks the heavens
 with its brightness as it falls, and Eridanus, the great river,
 received him and cooled his burning frame.* The Italian Naiads
 reared a tomb for him, and inscribed these words upon the stone:
 
 </p>
             "Driver of Phoebus' chariot, Phaeton,<br>
              Struck by Jove's thunder, rests beneath this stone.<br>
              He could not rule his father's car of fire,<br>
              Yet was it much so nobly to aspire."<br>
 
 <p>* See Proverbial Expressions, no. 4.
 
 </p>
 <p>His sisters, the Heliades, as they lamented his fate, were turned
 into poplar trees, on the banks of the river, and their tears, which
 continued to flow, became amber as they dropped into the stream.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milman, in his poem of "Samor," makes the following allusion to
 Phaeton's story:
 
 </p>
           "As when the palsied universe aghast<br>
            Lay... mute and still,<br>
            When drove, so poets sing, the Sun-born youth<br>
            Devious through Heaven's affrighted signs his sire's<br>
            Ill-granted chariot. Him the Thunderer hurled<br>
            From th' empyrean headlong to the gulf<br>
            Of thee half-parched Eridanus, where weep<br>
            Even now the sister trees their amber tears<br>
            O'er Phaeton untimely dead."<br>
 
 <p>In the beautiful lines of Walter Savage Landor, descriptive of the
 Sea-shell, there is an allusion to the Sun's palace and chariot. The
 water-nymph says:
 
 </p>
           "...I have sinuous shells of pearly hue<br>
            Within, and things that lustre have imbibed<br>
            In the sun's palace porch, where when unyoked<br>
            His chariot wheel stands midway on the wave.<br>
            Shake one and it awakens; then apply<br>
            Its polished lip to your attentive ear,<br>
            And it remembers its august abodes,<br>
            And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there."<br>
                                                  Gebir, Book 1.<br>
