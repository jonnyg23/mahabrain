 <h2 align="CENTER">THE GRAEAE AND GORGONS- PERSEUS- MEDUSA- ATLAS-</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">ANDROMEDA.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">THE GRAEAE AND GORGONS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>THE Graeae were three sisters who were gray-haired from their birth,
 whence their name. The Gorgons were monstrous females with huge
 teeth like those of swine, brazen claws, and snaky hair. None of these
 beings make much figure in mythology except Medusa, the Gorgon,
 whose story we shall next advert to. We mention them chiefly to
 introduce an ingenious theory of some modern writers, namely, that the
 Gorgons and Graeae were only personifications of the terrors of the
 sea, the former denoting the strong billows of the wide open main, and
 the latter the white-crested waves that dash against the rocks of
 the coast. Their names in Greek signify the above epithets.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PERSEUS AND MEDUSA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Perseus was the son of Jupiter and Danae. His grandfather
 Acrisius, alarmed by an oracle which had told him that his
 daughter's child would be the instrument of his death, caused the
 mother and child to be shut up in a chest and set adrift on the sea.
 The chest floated towards Seriphus, where it was found by a
 fisherman who conveyed the mother and infant to Polydectes, the king
 of the country, by whom they were treated with kindness. When
 Perseus was grown up Polydectes sent him to attempt the conquest of
 Medusa, a terrible monster who had laid waste the country. She was
 once a beautiful maiden whose hair was her chief glory but as she
 dared to vie in beauty with Minerva, the goddess deprived her of her
 charms and changed her beautiful ringlets into hissing serpents. She
 became a cruel monster of so frightful an aspect that no living
 thing could behold her without being turned into stone. All around the
 cavern where she dwelt might be seen the stony figures of men and
 animals which had chanced to catch a glimpse of her and had been
 petrified with the sight. Perseus, favoured by Minerva and Mercury,
 the former of whom lent him her shield and the latter his winged
 shoes, approached Medusa while she slept and taking care not to look
 directly at her, but guided by her image reflected in the bright
 shield which he bore, he cut off her head and gave it to Minerva,
 who fixed it in the middle of her AEgis.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton, in his "Comus," thus alludes to the AEgis:
 
 </p>
         "What thus snaky-headed Gorgon-shield<br>
          That wise Minerva wore, unconquered virgin,<br>
          Wherewith she freezed her foes to congealed stone,<br>
          But rigid looks of chaste austerity,<br>
          And noble grace that dashed brute violence<br>
          With sudden adoration and blank awe!"<br>
 
 <p>Armstrong, the poet of the "Art of Preserving Health," thus
 describes the effect of frost upon the waters:
 
 </p>
         "Now blows the surly North and chills throughout<br>
          The stiffening regions, while by stronger charms<br>
          Than Circe e'er or fell Medea brewed,<br>
          Each brook that wont to prattle to its banks<br>
          Lies all bestilled and wedged betwixt its banks,<br>
          Nor moves the withered reeds...<br>
          The surges baited by the fierce North-east,<br>
          Tossing with fretful spleen their angry heads,<br>
          E'en in the foam of all their madness struck<br>
          To monumental ice.<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">.     .     .     .     .     .     .     .</h3>
                                        Such execution,<br>
          So stern, so sudden, wrought the grisly aspect<br>
          Of terrible Medusa,<br>
          When wandering through the woods she turned to stone<br>
          Their savage tenants; just as the foaming Lion<br>
          Sprang furious on his prey, her speedier power<br>
          Outran his haste,<br>
          And fixed in that fierce attitude he stands<br>
          Like Rage in marble!"- Imitations of Shakespeare.<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">PERSEUS AND ATLAS.</h3>
 
 <p>After the slaughter of Medusa, Perseus, bearing with him the head of
 the Gorgon, flew far and wide, over land and sea. As night came on, he
 reached the western limit of the earth, where the sun goes down.
 Here he would gladly have rested till morning. It was the realm of
 King Atlas, whose bulk surpassed that of all other men. He was rich
 iii flocks and herds and had no neighbour or rival to dispute his
 state. But his chief pride was in his gardens whose fruit was of gold,
 hanging from golden branches, half hid with golden leaves. Perseus
 said to him, "I come as a guest. If you honour illustrious descent,
 I claim Jupiter for my father; if mighty deeds, I plead the conquest
 of the Gorgon. I seek rest and food." But Atlas remembered that an
 ancient prophecy had warned him that a son of Jove should one day
 rob him of His golden apples. So he answered, "Begone! or neither your
 false claims of glory nor parentage shall protect you;" and he
 attempted to thrust him out. Perseus, finding the giant too strong for
 him, said, "Since you value my friendship so little, deign to accept a
 present;" and turning his face away, he held up the Gorgon's head.
 Atlas, with all his bulk, was changed into stone. His beard and hair
 became forests, his arms and shoulders cliffs, his head a summit,
 and his bones rocks. Each part increased in bulk till be became a
 mountain, and (such was the pleasure of the gods) heaven with all
 its stars rests upon his shoulders.
 
 </p>
                      THE SEA-MONSTER.<br>
 
 <p>Perseus, continuing his flight, arrived at the country of the
 AEthiopians, of which Cepheus was king. Cassiopeia his queen, proud of
 her beauty, had dared to compare herself to the Sea-nymphs, which
 roused their indignation to such a degree that they sent a
 prodigious sea-monster to ravage the coast. To appease the deities,
 Cepheus was directed by the oracle to expose his daughter Andromeda to
 be devoured by the monster. As Perseus looked down from his aerial
 height he beheld the virgin chained to a rock, and waiting the
 approach of the serpent. She was so pale and motionless that if it had
 not been for her flowing tears and her hair that moved in the
 breeze, he would have taken her for a marble statue. He was so
 startled at the sight that he almost forgot to wave his wings. As he
 hovered over her he said, "O virgin, undeserving of those chains,
 but rather of such as bind fond lovers together, tell me, I beseech
 you, your name, and the name of your country, and why you are thus
 bound." At first she was silent from modesty, and, if she could, would
 have hid her face with her hands; but when he repeated his
 questions, for fear she might be thought guilty of some fault which
 she dared not tell, she disclosed her name And that of her country,
 and her mother's pride of beauty. Before she had done speaking, a
 sound was heard off upon the water, and the sea-monster appeared, with
 his head raised above the surface, cleaving the waves with his broad
 breast. The virgin shrieked, the father and mother who had now arrived
 at the scene, wretched both, but the mother more justly so, stood
 by, not able to afford protection, but only to pour forth lamentations
 and to embrace the victim. Then spoke Perseus; "There will be time
 enough for tears; this hour is all we have for rescue. My rank as
 the son of Jove and my renown as the slayer of the Gorgon might make
 me acceptable as a suitor; but I will try to win her by services
 rendered, if the gods will only be propitious. If she be rescued by my
 valour, I demand that she be my reward." The parents consent (how
 could they hesitate?) and promise a royal dowry with her.
 </p>
 <p>And now the monster was within the range of a stone thrown by a
 skilful slinger, when with a sudden bound the youth soared into the
 air. As an eagle, when from his lofty flight he sees a serpent basking
 in the sun, pounces upon him and seizes him by the neck to prevent him
 from turning his head round and using his fangs, so the youth darted
 down upon the back of the monster and plunged his sword into its
 shoulder. Irritated by the wound, the monster raised himself into
 the air, then plunged into the depth; then, like a wild boar
 surrounded by a pack of barking dogs, turned swiftly from side to
 side, while the youth eluded its attacks by means of his wings.
 Wherever he can find a passage for his sword between the scales he
 makes a wound, piercing now the side, now the flank, as it slopes
 towards the tail. The brute spouts from his nostrils water mixed
 with blood. The wings of the hero are wet with it, and he dares no
 longer trust to them. Alighting on a rock which rose above the
 waves, and holding on by a projecting fragment, as the monster floated
 near he gave him a death stroke. The people who had gathered on the
 shore shouted so that the hills reechoed with the sound. The
 parents, transported with joy, embraced their future son-in-law,
 calling him their deliverer and the saviour of their house, and the
 virgin, both cause and reward of the contest, descended from the rock.
 
 </p>
 <p>Cassiopeia was an AEthiopian, and consequently, in spite of her
 boasted beauty, black; at least so Milton seems to have thought, who
 alludes to this story in his "Penseroso," where he addresses
 Melancholy as the
 
 </p>
           "...goddess, sage and holy,<br>
            Whose saintly visage is too bright<br>
            To hit the sense of human sight,<br>
            And, therefore, to our weaker view,<br>
            O'erlaid with black, staid Wisdom's hue.<br>
            Black, but such as in esteem<br>
            Prince Memnon's sister might beseem.<br>
            Or that starred AEthiop queen that strove<br>
            To set her beauty's praise above<br>
            The sea-nymphs, and their powers offended."<br>
 
 <p>Cassiopeia is called "the starred AEthiop, queen" because after
 her death she was placed among the stars, forming the constellation of
 that name. Though she attained this honour, yet the Sea-Nymphs, her
 old enemies, prevailed so far as to cause her to be placed in that
 part of the heaven near the pole, where every night she is half the
 time held with her head downward, to give her a lesson of humility.
 </p>
 <p>Memnon was an AEthiopian prince, of whom we shall tell in a future
 chapter.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE WEDDING FEAST.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The joyful parents, with Perseus and Andromeda, repaired to the
 palace, where a banquet was spread for them, and all was joy and
 festivity. But suddenly a noise was heard of warlike clamour, and
 Phineus, the betrothed of the virgin, with a party of his adherents,
 burst in, demanding the maiden as his own. It was in vain that Cepheus
 remonstrated- "You should have claimed her when she lay bound to the
 rock, the monster's victim. The sentence of the gods dooming her to
 such a fate dissolved all engagements, as death itself would have
 done." Phineus made no reply, but hurled his javelin at Perseus, but
 it missed its mark and fell harmless. Perseus would have thrown his in
 turn, but the cowardly assailant ran and took shelter behind the
 altar. But his act was a signal for an onset by his hand upon the
 guests of Cepheus. They defended themselves and a general conflict
 ensued, the old king retreating from the scene after fruitless
 expostulations, calling the gods to witness that he was guiltless of
 this outrage on the rights of hospitality.
 </p>
 <p>Perseus and his friends maintained for some time the unequal
 contest; but the numbers of the assailants were too great for them,
 and destruction seemed inevitable, when a sudden thought struck
 Perseus,- "I will make my enemy defend me." Then with a loud voice
 he exclaimed, "If I have any friend here let him turn away his
 eyes!" and held aloft the Gorgon's head. "Seek not to frighten us with
 your jugglery," said Thescelus, and raised his javelin in the act to
 throw, and became stone in the very attitude. Ampyx was about to
 plunge his sword into the body of a prostrate foe, but his arm
 stiffened and he could neither thrust forward nor withdraw it.
 Another, in the midst of a vociferous challenge, stopped, his mouth
 open, but no sound issuing. One of Perseus's friends, Aconteus, caught
 sight of the Gorgon and stiffened like the rest. Astyages struck him
 with his sword, but instead of wounding, it recoiled with a ringing
 noise.
 </p>
 <p>Phineus beheld this dreadful result of his unjust aggression, and
 felt confounded. He called aloud to his friends, but got no answer; he
 touched them and found them stone. Falling on his knees and stretching
 out his hands to Perseus, but turning his head away, he begged for
 mercy. "Take all," said he, "give me but my life." "Base coward," said
 Perseus, "thus much I will grant you; no weapon shall touch you;
 moreover, you shall be preserved in my house as a memorial of these
 events." So saying, he held the Gorgon's head to the side where
 Phineus was looking, and in the very form which he knelt, with his
 hands outstretched and face averted, he became fixed immovably, a mass
 of stone!
 
 </p>
 <p>The following allusion to Perseus is from Milman's "Samor":
 
 </p>
         "As 'mid the fabled Libyan bridal stood<br>
          Perseus in stern tranquillity of wrath,<br>
          Half stood, half floated on his ankle-plumes<br>
          Out-swelling, while the bright face on his shield<br>
          Looked into stone the raging fray; so rose,<br>
          But with no magic arms, wearing alone<br>
          Th' appalling and control of his firm look,<br>
          The Briton Samor; at his rising awe<br>
          Went abroad, and the riotous hall was mute."<br>
