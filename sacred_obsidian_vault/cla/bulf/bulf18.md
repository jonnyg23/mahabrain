 <h2 align="CENTER">HERCULES- HEBE AND GANYMEDE.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">HERCULES.</h3>
 
 <p>HERCULES was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena. As Juno was always
 hostile to the offspring of her husband by mortal mothers, she
 declared war against Hercules from his birth. She sent two serpents to
 destroy him as he lay in his cradle, but the precocious infant
 strangled them with his own hands. He was, however, by the arts of
 Juno rendered subject to Eurystheus and compelled to perform all his
 commands. Eurystheus enjoined upon him a succession of desperate
 adventures, which are called the "Twelve Labours of Hercules." The
 first was the fight with the Nemean lion. The valley of Nemea was
 infested by a terrible lion. Eurystheus ordered Hercules to bring
 him the skin of this monster. After using in vain his club and
 arrows against the lion, Hercules strangled the animal with his hands.
 He returned carrying the dead lion on his shoulders; but Eurystheus
 was so frightened at the sight of it and at this proof of the
 prodigious strength of the hero, that he ordered him to deliver the
 account of his exploits in future outside the town.
 </p>
 <p>His next labour was the slaughter of the Hydra. This monster ravaged
 the country of Argos, and dwelt in a swamp near the well of Amymone.
 This well had been discovered by Amymone when the country was
 suffering from drought, and the story was that Neptune, who loved her,
 had permitted her to touch the rock with his trident, and a spring
 of three outlets burst forth. Here the Hydra took up his position, and
 Hercules was sent to destroy him. The Hydra had nine heads, of which
 the middle one was immortal. Hercules struck off its heads with his
 club, but in the place of the head knocked off, two new ones grew
 forth each time. At length with the assistance of his faithful servant
 Iolaus, he burned away the heads of the Hydra, and buried the ninth or
 immortal one under a huge rock.
 </p>
 <p>Another labour was the cleaning of the Augean stables. Augeas,
 king of Elis, had a herd of three thousand oxen, whose stalls had
 not been cleansed for thirty years. Hercules brought the rivers
 Alpheus and Peneus through them, and cleansed them thoroughly in one
 day.
 </p>
 <p>His next labour was of a more delicate kind. Admeta, the daughter of
 Eurystheus, longed to obtain the girdle of the queen of the Amazons,
 and Eurystheus ordered Hercules to go and get it. The Amazons were a
 nation of women. They were very warlike and held several flourishing
 cities. It was their custom to bring up only the female children;
 the boys were either sent away to the neighbouring nations or put to
 death. Hercules was accompanied by a number of volunteers, and after
 various adventures at last reached the country of the Amazons.
 Hippolyta, the queen, received him kindly, and consented to yield
 him her girdle, but Juno, taking the form of an Amazon, went and
 persuaded the rest that the strangers were carrying off their queen.
 They instantly armed and came in great numbers down to the ship.
 Hercules, thinking that Hippolyta, had acted treacherously, slew
 her, and taking her girdle made sail homewards.
 </p>
 <p>Another task enjoined him was to bring to Eurystheus the oxen of
 Geryon, a monster with three bodies, who dwelt in the island of
 Erytheia (the red), so called because it lay at the west, under the
 rays of the setting sun. This description is thought to apply to
 Spain, of which Geryon was king. After traversing various countries,
 Hercules reached at length the frontiers of Libya and Europe, where he
 raised the two mountains of Calpe and Abyla, as monuments of his
 progress, or, according to another account, rent one mountain into two
 and left half on each side, forming the straits of Gibraltar, the
 two mountains being called the Pillars of Hercules. The oxen were
 guarded by the giant Eurytion and his two-headed dog, but Hercules
 killed the giant and his dog and brought away the oxen in safety to
 Eurystheus.
 </p>
 <p>The most difficult labour of all was getting the golden apples of
 the Hesperides, for Hercules did not know where to find them. These
 were the apples which Juno had received at her wedding from the
 goddess of the Earth, and which she had intrusted to the keeping of
 the daughters of Hesperus, assisted by a watchful dragon. After
 various adventures Hercules arrived at Mount Atlas in Africa. Atlas
 was one of the Titans who had warred against the gods, and after
 they were subdued, Atlas was condemned to bear on his shoulders the
 weight of the heavens. He was the father of the Hesperides, and
 Hercules thought might, if any one could, find the apples and bring
 them to him. But how to send Atlas away from his post, or bear up
 the heavens while he was gone? Hercules took the burden on his own
 shoulders, and sent Atlas to seek the apples. He returned with them,
 and though somewhat reluctantly, took his burden upon his shoulders
 again, and let Hercules return with the apples to Eurystheus.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton, in his "Comus," makes the Hesperides the daughters of
 Hesperus and niece of Atlas:
 
 </p>
               "...amidst the gardens fair<br>
                Of Hesperus and his daughters three,<br>
                That sing about the golden tree."<br>
 
 <p>The poets, led by the analogy of the lovely appearance of the
 western sky at sunset, viewed the west as a region of brightness and
 glory. Hence they placed in it the Isles of the Blest, the ruddy
 Isle Erytheia, on which the bright oxen of Geryon were pastured, and
 the Isle of the Hesperides. The apples are supposed by some to be
 the oranges of Spain, of which the Greeks had heard some obscure
 accounts.
 
 </p>
 <p>A celebrated exploit of Hercules was his victory over Antaeus.
 Antaeus, the son of Terra, the Earth, was a mighty giant and wrestler,
 whose strength was invincible so long as he remained in contact with
 his mother Earth. He compelled all strangers who came to his country
 to wrestle with him, on condition that if conquered (as they all were)
 they should be put to death. Hercules encountered him, and finding
 that it was of no avail to throw him, for he always rose with
 renewed strength from every fall, he lifted him up from the earth
 and strangled him in the air.
 </p>
 <p>Cacus was a huge giant, who inhabited a cave on Mount Aventine,
 and plundered the surrounding country. When Hercules was driving
 home the oxen of Geryon, Cacus stole part of the cattle, while the
 hero slept. That their footprints might not serve to show where they
 had been driven, be dragged them backward by their tails to his
 cave; so their tracks all seemed to show that they had gone in the
 opposite direction. Hercules was deceived by this stratagem, and would
 have failed to find his oxen, if it had not happened that in driving
 the remainder of the herd past the cave where the stolen ones were
 concealed, those within began to low, and were thus discovered.
 Cacus was slain by Hercules.
 </p>
 <p>The last exploit we shall record was bringing Cerberus from the
 lower world. Hercules descended into Hades, accompanied by Mercury and
 Minerva. He obtained permission from Pluto to carry Cerberus to the
 upper air, provided he could do it without the use of weapons; and
 in spite of the monster's struggling, he seized him, held him fast,
 and carried him to Eurystheus, and afterwards brought him back
 again. When he was in Hades he obtained the liberty of Theseus, his
 admirer and imitator, who had been detained a prisoner there for an
 unsuccessful attempt to carry off Proserpine.
 </p>
 <p>Hercules in a fit of madness killed his friend Iphitus, and was
 condemned for this offence to become the slave of Queen Omphale for
 three years. While in this service the hero's nature seemed changed.
 He lived effeminately, wearing at times the dress of a woman, and
 spinning wool with the hand-maidens of Omphale, while the queen wore
 his lion's skin. When this service was ended he married Dejanira and
 lived in peace with her three years. On one occasion as he was
 travelling with his wife, they came to a river, across which the
 Centaur Nessus carried travellers for a stated fee. Hercules himself
 forded the river, but gave Dejanira to Nessus to be carried across.
 Nessus attempted to run away with her, but Hercules heard her cries
 and shot an arrow into the heart of Nessus. The dying Centaur told
 Dejanira to take a portion of his blood and keep it, as it might be
 used as a charm to preserve the love of her husband.
 </p>
 <p>Dejanira did so, and before long fancied she had occasion to use it.
 Hercules in one of his conquests had taken prisoner a fair maiden,
 named Iole, of whom he seemed more fond than Dejanira approved. When
 Hercules was about to offer sacrifices to the gods in honour of his
 victory, he sent to his wife for a white robe to use on the
 occasion. Dejanira, thinking it a good opportunity to try her
 love-spell, steeped the garment in the blood of Nessus. We are to
 suppose she took care to wash out all traces of it, but the magic
 power remained, and as soon as the garment became warm on the body
 of Hercules the poison penetrated into all his limbs and caused him
 the most intense agony. In his frenzy he seized Lichas, who had
 brought him the fatal robe, and hurled him into the sea. He wrenched
 off the garment, but it stuck to his flesh, and with it he tore away
 whole pieces of his body. In this state he embarked on board a ship
 and was conveyed home. Dejanira, on seeing what she had unwittingly
 done, hung herself. Hercules, prepared to die, ascended Mount OEta,
 where he built a funeral pile of trees, gave his bow and arrows to
 Philoctetes, and laid himself down on the pile, his head resting on
 his club, and his lion's skin spread over him. With a countenance as
 serene as if he were taking his place at a festal board he commanded
 Philoctetes to apply the torch. The flames spread apace and soon
 invested the whole mass.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton thus alludes to the frenzy of Hercules:
 
 </p>
           "As when Alcides* from OEchalia crowned<br>
            With conquest, felt the envenomed robe, and tore,<br>
            Through pain, up by the roots Thessalian pines<br>
            And Lichas from the top of OEta threw<br>
            Into the Euboic Sea."<br>
 
 <p>* Alcides. a name of Hercules.
 
 </p>
 <p>The gods themselves felt troubled at seeing the champion of the
 earth so brought to his end. But Jupiter with cheerful countenance
 thus addressed them: "I am pleased to see your concern, my princes,
 and am gratified to perceive that I am the ruler of a loyal people,
 and that my son enjoys your favour. For although your interest in
 him arises from his noble deeds, yet it is not the less gratifying
 to me. But now I say to you, Fear not. He who conquered all else is
 not to be conquered by those flames which you see blazing on Mount
 OEta. Only his mother's share in him can perish; what he derived
 from me is immortal. I shall take him, dead to earth, to the
 heavenly shores, and I require of you all to receive him kindly. If
 any of you feel grieved at his attaining this honour, yet no one can
 deny that he has deserved it." The gods all gave their assent; Juno
 only heard the closing words with some displeasure that she should
 be so particularly pointed at, yet not enough to make her regret the
 determination of her husband. So when the flames had consumed the
 mother's share of Hercules, the diviner part, instead of being injured
 thereby, seemed to start forth with new vigour, to assume a more lofty
 port and a more awful dignity. Jupiter enveloped him in a cloud, and
 took him up in a four-horse chariot to dwell among the stars. As he
 took his place in heaven, Atlas felt the added weight.
 </p>
 <p>Juno, now reconciled to him, gave him her daughter Hebe in marriage.
 
 </p>
 <p>The poet Schiller, in one of his pieces called the "Ideal and Life,"
 illustrates the contrast between the practical and the imaginative
 in some beautiful stanzas, of which the last two may be thus
 translated:
 
 </p>
             "Deep degraded to a coward's slave,<br>
              Endless contests bore Alcides brave,<br>
              Through the thorny path of suffering led;<br>
              Slew the Hydra, crushed the lion's might,<br>
              Threw himself, to bring his friend to light,<br>
              Living, in the skiff that bears the dead.<br>
              All the torments, every toil of earth<br>
              Juno's hatred on him could impose,<br>
              Well he bore them, from his fated birth<br>
              To life's grandly mournful close.<br>
 
             "Till the god, the earthly part forsaken,<br>
              From the man in flames asunder taken,<br>
              Drank the heavenly ether's purer breath.<br>
              Joyous in the new unwonted lightness,<br>
              Soared he upwards to celestial brightness,<br>
              Earth's dark heavy burden lost in death.<br>
              High Olympus gives harmonious greeting<br>
              To the hall where reigns his sire adored;<br>
              Youth's bright goddess, with a blush at meeting,<br>
              Gives the nectar to her lord."<br>
 <h3 align="CENTER">S. G. B.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">HEBE AND GANYMEDE.</h3>
 
 <p>Hebe, the daughter of Juno, and goddess of youth, was cup-bearer
 to the gods. The usual story is that she resigned her office on
 becoming the wife of Hercules. But there is another statement which
 our countryman Crawford, the sculptor, has adopted in his group of
 Hebe and Ganymede, now in the Athenaeum gallery. According to this,
 Hebe was dismissed from her office in consequence of a fall which
 she met with one day when in attendance on the gods. Her successor was
 Ganymede, a Trojan boy, whom Jupiter, in the disguise of an eagle,
 seized and carried off from the midst of his play-fellows on Mount
 Ida, bore up to heaven, and installed in the vacant place.
 
 </p>
 <p>Tennyson, in his "Palace of Art," describes among the decorations on
 the walls a picture representing this legend:
 
 </p>
             "There, too, flushed Ganymede, his rosy thigh<br>
                Half buried in the eagle's down,<br>
              Sole as a flying star shot through the sky<br>
                Above the pillared town."<br>
 
 <p>And in Shelley's "Prometheus" Jupiter calls to his cup-bearer thus:
 
 </p>
             "Pour forth heaven's wine, Idaean Ganymede,<br>
              And let it fill the Daedal cups like fire."<br>
 
 <p>The beautiful legend of the "Choice of Hercules" may be found in the
 "Tatler," No. 97.
