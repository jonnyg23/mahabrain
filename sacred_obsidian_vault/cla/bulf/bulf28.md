 <h2 align="CENTER">ADVENTURES OF ULYSSES- THE LOTUS-EATERS- CYCLOPSE- CIRCE</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">-SIRENS- SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS- CALYPSO.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">RETURN OF ULYSSES.</h3>
 
 <p>THE romantic poem of the Odyssey is now to engage our attention.
 It narrates the wanderings of Ulysses (Odysseus in the Greek language)
 in his return from Troy to his own kingdom Ithaca.
 </p>
 <p>From Troy the vessels first made land at Ismarus, city of the
 Ciconians, where, in a skirmish with the inhabitants, Ulysses lost six
 men from each ship. Sailing thence, they were overtaken by a storm
 which drove them for nine days along the sea till they reached the
 country of the Lotus-eaters. Here, after watering, Ulysses sent
 three of his men to discover who the inhabitants were. These men on
 coming among the Lotus-eaters were kindly entertained by them, and
 were given some of their own food, the lotus-plant, to eat. The effect
 of this food was such that those who partook of it lost all thoughts
 of home and wished to remain in that country. It was by main force
 that Ulysses dragged these men away, and he was even obliged to tie
 them under the benches of his ships.*
 
 </p>
 <p>* Tennyson in the "Lotos-eaters," has charmingly expressed the
 dreamy languid feeling which the lotus food is said to have produced.
 
 </p>
         "How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream<br>
          With half-shut eyes ever to seem<br>
          Falling asleep in a half-dream!<br>
          To dream and dream, like yonder amber light<br>
          Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;<br>
          To hear each other's whispered speech;<br>
          Eating the Lotos, day by day,<br>
          To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,<br>
          And tender curving lines of creamy spray:<br>
          To lend our hearts and spirits wholly<br>
          To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;<br>
          To muse and brood and live again in memory,<br>
          With those old faces of our infancy<br>
          Heaped over with a mound of grass,<br>
          Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass."<br>
 
 <p>They next arrived at the country of the Cyclopses. The Cyclopses
 were giants, who inhabited an island of which they were the only
 possessors. The name means "round eye," and these giants were so
 called because they had but one eye, and that placed in the middle
 of the forehead. They dwelt in caves and fed on the wild productions
 of the island and on what their flocks yielded, for they were
 shepherds. Ulysses left the main body of his ships at anchor, and with
 one vessel went to the Cyclopses' island to explore for supplies. He
 landed with his companions, carrying with them a jar of wine for a
 present, and coming to a large cave they entered it, and finding no
 one within examined its contents. They found it stored with the
 richest of the flock, quantities of cheese, pails and bowls of milk,
 lambs and kids in their pens, all in nice order. Presently arrived the
 master of the cave, Polyphemus, bearing an immense bundle of firewood,
 which he threw down before the cavern's mouth. He then drove into
 the cave the sheep and goats to be milked, and, entering, rolled to
 the cave's mouth an enormous rock, that twenty oxen could not draw.
 Next he sat down and milked his ewes, preparing a part for cheese, and
 setting the rest aside for his customary drink. Then, turning round
 his great eye, he discerned the strangers, and growled out to them,
 demanding who they were, and where from. Ulysses replied most
 humbly, stating that they were Greeks, from the great expedition
 that had lately won so much glory in the conquest of Troy; that they
 were now on their way home, and finished by imploring his
 hospitality in the name of the gods. Polyphemus deigned no answer, but
 reaching out his hand seized two of the Greeks, whom he hurled against
 the side of the cave, and dashed out their brains. He proceeded to
 devour them with great relish, and having made a hearty meal,
 stretched himself out on the floor to sleep. Ulysses was tempted to
 seize the opportunity and plunge his sword into him as be slept, but
 recollected that it would only expose them all to certain destruction,
 as the rock with which the giant had closed up the door was far beyond
 their power to remove, and they would therefore be in hopeless
 imprisonment. Next morning the giant seized two more of the Greeks,
 and despatched them in the same manner as their companions, feasting
 on their flesh till no fragment was left. He then moved away the
 rock from the door, drove out his flocks, and went out, carefully
 replacing the barrier after him. When he was gone Ulysses planned
 how he might take vengeance for his murdered friends, and effect his
 escape with his surviving companions. He made his men prepare a
 massive bar of wood cut by the Cyclops for a staff, which they found
 in the cave. They sharpened the end of it, and seasoned it in the
 fire, and hid it under the straw on the cavern floor. Then four of the
 boldest were selected, with whom Ulysses joined himself as a fifth.
 The Cyclops came home at evening, rolled away the stone and drove in
 his flock as usual. After milking them and making his arrangements
 as before, he seized two more of Ulysses' companions and dashed
 their brains out, and made his evening meal upon them as he had on the
 others. After he had supped, Ulysses approaching him handed him a bowl
 of wine, saying, "Cyclops, this is wine; taste and drink after thy
 meal of men's flesh." He took and drank it, and was hugely delighted
 with it, and called for more. Ulysses supplied him once again, which
 pleased the giant so much that he promised him as a favour that he
 should be the last of the party devoured. He asked his name, to
 which Ulysses replied, "My name is Noman."
 </p>
 <p>After his supper the giant lay down to repose, and was soon found
 asleep. Then Ulysses with his four select friends thrust the end of
 the stake into the fire till it was all one burning coal, then poising
 it exactly above the giant's only eye, they buried it deeply into
 the socket, twirling it round as a carpenter does his auger. The
 howling monster with his outcry filled the cavern, and Ulysses with
 his aids nimbly got out of his way and concealed themselves in the
 cave. He, bellowing, called aloud on all the Cyclopses dwelling in the
 caves around him, far and near. They on his cry flocked round the den,
 and inquired what grievous hurt had caused him to sound such an
 alarm and break their slumbers. He replied, "O friends, I die, and
 Noman gives the blow." They answered, "If no man hurts thee it is
 the stroke of Jove, and thou must bear it." So saying, they left him
 groaning.
 </p>
 <p>Next morning the Cyclops rolled away the stone to let his flock
 out to pasture, but planted himself in the door of the cave to feel of
 all as they went out, that Ulysses and his men should not escape
 with them. But Ulysses had made his men harness the rams of the
 flock three abreast, with osiers which they found on the floor of
 the cave. To the middle ram of the three one of the Greeks suspended
 himself, so protected by the exterior rams on either side. As they
 passed, the giant felt of the animals' backs and sides, but never
 thought of their bellies; so the men all passed safe, Ulysses
 himself being on the last one that passed. When they had got a few
 paces from the cavern, Ulysses and his friends released themselves
 from their rams, and drove a good part of the flock down to the
 shore to their boat. They put them aboard with all haste, then
 pushed off from the shore, and when at a safe distance Ulysses shouted
 out, "Cyclops, the gods have well requited thee for thy atrocious
 deeds. Know it is Ulysses to whom thou owest thy shameful loss of
 sight." The Cyclops, hearing this, seized a rock that projected from
 the side of the mountain, and rending it from its bed he lifted it
 high in the air, then exerting all his force, hurled it in the
 direction of the voice. Down came the mass, just clearing the vessel's
 stern. The ocean, at the plunge of the huge rock, heaved the ship
 towards the land, so that it barely escaped being swamped by the
 waves. When they had with the utmost difficulty pulled off shore,
 Ulysses was about to hail the giant again, but his friends besought
 him not to do so. He could not forbear, however, letting the giant
 know that they had escaped his missile, but waited till they had
 reached a safer distance than before. The giant answered them with
 curses, but Ulysses and his friends plied their oars vigorously, and
 soon regained their companions.
 </p>
 <p>Ulysses next arrived at the island of AEolus. To this monarch
 Jupiter had intrusted the government of the winds, to send them
 forth or retain them at his will. He treated Ulysses hospitably, and
 at his departure gave him, tied up in a leathern bag with a silver
 string, such winds as might be hurtful and dangerous, commanding
 fair winds to blow the barks towards their country. Nine days they
 sped before the wind, and all that time Ulysses had stood at the helm,
 without sleep. At last quite exhausted he lay down to sleep. While
 he slept, the crew conferred together about the mysterious bag, and
 concluded it must contain treasures given by the hospitable King
 AEolus to their commander. Tempted to secure some portion for
 themselves, they loosed the string, when immediately the winds
 rushed forth. The ships were driven far from their course, and back
 again to the island they had just left. AEolus was so indignant at
 their folly that he refused to assist them further, and they were
 obliged to labour over their course once more by means of their oars.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE LAESTRYGONIANS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Their next adventure was with the barbarous tribe of Laestrygonians.
 The vessels all pushed into the harbour, tempted by the secure
 appearance of the cove, completely land-locked; only Ulysses moored
 his vessel without. As soon as the Laestrygonians found the ships
 completely in their power they attacked them, heaving huge stones
 which broke and overturned them, and with their spears despatched
 the seamen as they struggled in the water. All the vessels with
 their crews were destroyed, except Ulysses' own ship, which had
 remained outside, and finding no safety but in flight, he exhorted his
 men to ply their oars vigorously, and they escaped.
 </p>
 <p>With grief for their slain companions mixed with joy at their own
 escape, they pursued their way till they arrived at the AEaean isle,
 where Circe dwelt, the daughter of the sun. Landing here, Ulysses
 climbed a hill, and gazing round saw no signs of habitation except
 in one spot at the centre of the island, where he perceived a palace
 embowered with trees. He sent forward one-half of his crew, under
 the command of Eurylochus, to see what prospect of hospitality they
 might find. As they approached the palace, they found themselves
 surrounded by lions, tigers, and wolves, not fierce, but tamed by
 Circe's art, for she was a powerful magician. All these animals had
 once been men, but had been changed by Circe's enchantments into the
 forms of beasts. The sounds of soft music were heard from within,
 and a sweet female voice singing. Eurylochus called aloud and the
 goddess came forth and invited them in; they all gladly entered except
 Eurylochus, who suspected danger. The goddess conducted her guests
 to a seat, and had them served with wine and other delicacies. When
 they had feasted heartily, she touched them one by one with her
 wand, and they became immediately changed into swine, in "head,
 body, voice, and bristles," yet with their intellects as before. She
 shut them in her sties and supplied them with acorns and such other
 things as swine love.
 </p>
 <p>Eurylochus hurried back to the ship and told the tale. Ulysses
 thereupon determined to go himself, and try if by any means he might
 deliver his companions. As he strode onward alone, he met a youth
 who addressed him familiarly, appearing to be acquainted with his
 adventures. He announced himself as Mercury, and informed Ulysses of
 the arts of Circe, and of the danger of approaching her. As Ulysses
 was not to be dissuaded from his attempt, Mercury provided him with
 a sprig of the plant Moly, of wonderful power to resist sorceries, and
 instructed him how to act. Ulysses proceeded, and reaching the
 palace was courteously received by Circe, who entertained him as she
 had done his companions, and after he had eaten and drank, touched him
 with her wand, saying, "Hence, seek the sty and wallow with thy
 friends." But he, instead of obeying, drew his sword and rushed upon
 her with fury in his countenance. She fell on her knees and begged for
 mercy. He dictated a solemn oath that she would release his companions
 and practise no further harm against him or them; and she repeated it,
 at the same time promising to dismiss them all in safety after
 hospitably entertaining them. She was as good as her word. The men
 were restored to their shapes, the rest of the crew summoned from
 the shore, and the whole magnificently entertained day after day, till
 Ulysses seemed to have forgotten his native land, and to have
 reconciled himself to an inglorious life of ease and pleasure.
 </p>
 <p>At length his companions recalled him to nobler sentiments, and he
 received their admonition gratefully. Circe aided their departure, and
 instructed them how to pass safely by the coast of the Sirens. The
 Sirens were sea-nymphs who had the power of charming by their song all
 who heard them, so that the unhappy mariners were irresistibly
 impelled to cast themselves into the sea to their destruction. Circe
 directed Ulysses to fill the ears of his seamen with wax, so that they
 should not hear the strain; and to cause himself to be bound to the
 mast, and his people to be strictly enjoined, whatever he might say or
 do, by no means to release him till they should have passed the
 Sirens' island. Ulysses obeyed these directions. He filled the ears of
 his people with wax, and suffered them to bind him with cords firmly
 to the mast. As they approached the Sirens' island, the sea was
 calm, and over the waters came the notes of music so ravishing and
 attractive that Ulysses struggled to get loose, and by cries and signs
 to his people begged to be released; but they, obedient to his
 previous orders, sprang forward and bound him still faster. They
 held on their course, and the music grew fainter till it ceased to
 be heard, when with joy Ulysses gave his companions the signal to
 unseal their ears, and they relieved him from his bonds.
 
 </p>
 <p>The imagination of a modern poet, Keats, has discovered for us the
 thoughts that passed through the brains of the victims of Circe, after
 their transformation. In his "Endymion" he represents one of them, a
 monarch in the guise of an elephant, addressing the sorceress in human
 language, thus:
 
 </p>
           "I sue not for my happy crown again;<br>
            I sue not for my phalanx on the plain;<br>
            I sue not for my lone, my widowed wife;<br>
            I sue not for my ruddy drops of life,<br>
            My children fair, my lovely girls and boys;<br>
            I will forget them; I will pass these joys,<br>
            Ask nought so heavenward; so too- too high;<br>
            Only I pray, as fairest boon, to die;<br>
            To be delivered from this cumbrous flesh,<br>
            From this gross, detestable, filthy mesh,<br>
            And merely given to the cold, bleak air.<br>
            Have mercy, goddess! Circe, feel my prayer!"<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">SCYLLA AND CHARYBDIS.</h3>
 
 <p>Ulysses had been warned by Circe of the two monsters Scylla and
 Charybdis. We have already met with Scylla in the story of Glaucus,
 and remember that she was once a beautiful maiden and was changed into
 a snaky monster by Circe. She dwelt in a cave high up on the cliff,
 from whence she was accustomed to thrust forth her long necks (for she
 had six heads), and in each of her mouths seize one of the crew of
 every vessel passing within reach. The other terror, Charybdis, was
 a gulf, nearly on a level with the water. Thrice each day the water
 rushed into a frightful chasm, and thrice was disgorged. Any vessel
 coming near the whirlpool when the tide was rushing in must inevitably
 be ingulfed; not Neptune himself could save it.
 </p>
 <p>On approaching the haunt of the dread monsters, Ulysses kept
 strict watch to discover them. The roar of the waters as Charybdis
 ingulfed them, gave warning at a distance, but Scylla could nowhere be
 discerned. While Ulysses and his men watched with anxious eyes the
 dreadful whirlpool, they were not equally on their guard from the
 attack of Scylla, and the monster, darting forth her snaky heads,
 caught six of his men, and bore them away, shrieking, to her den. It
 was the saddest sight Ulysses had yet seen; to behold his friends thus
 sacrificed and hear their cries, unable to afford them any assistance.
 </p>
 <p>Circe had warned him of another danger. After passing Scylla and
 Charybdis the next land he would make was Thrinakia, an island whereon
 were pastured the cattle of Hyperion, the Sun, tended by his daughters
 Lampetia and Phaethusa. These flocks must not be violated, whatever
 the wants of the voyagers might be. If this injunction were
 transgressed destruction was sure to fall on the offenders.
 </p>
 <p>Ulysses would willingly have passed the island of the Sun without
 stopping, but his companions so urgently pleaded for the rest and
 refreshment that would be derived from anchoring and passing the night
 on shore, that Ulysses yielded. He bound them, however, with an oath
 that they would not touch one of the animals of the sacred flocks
 and herds, but content themselves with what provision they yet had
 left of the supply which Circe had put on board. So long as this
 supply lasted the people kept their oath, but contrary winds
 detained them at the island for a month, and after consuming all their
 stock of provisions, they were forced to rely upon the birds and
 fishes they could catch. Famine pressed them, and at length one day,
 in the absence of Ulysses, they slew some of the cattle, vainly
 attempting to make amends for the deed by offering from them a portion
 to the offended powers. Ulysses, on his return to the shore, was
 horror-struck at perceiving what they had done, and the more so on
 account of the portentous signs which followed. The skins crept on the
 ground, and the joints of meat lowed on the spits while roasting.
 </p>
 <p>The wind becoming fair they sailed from the island. They had not
 gone far when the weather changed, and a storm of thunder and
 lightning ensued. A stroke of lightning shattered their mast, which in
 its fall killed the pilot. At last the vessel itself came to pieces.
 The keel and mast floating side by side, Ulysses formed of them a
 raft, to which he clung, and, the wind changing, the waves bore him to
 Calypso's island. All the rest of the crew perished.
 
 </p>
 <p>The following allusion to the topics we have just been considering
 is from Milton's "Comus," line 252:
 
 </p>
         "...I have often heard<br>
          My mother Circe and the Sirens three,<br>
          Amidst the flowery-kirtled Naiades,<br>
          Culling their potent herbs and baneful drugs,<br>
          Who as they sung would take the prisoned soul<br>
          And lap it in Elysium. Scylla wept,<br>
          And chid her barking waves into attention,<br>
          And fell Charybdis murmured soft applause."<br>
 
 <p>Scylla and Charybdis have become proverbial, to denote opposite
 dangers which beset one's course. See Proverbial Expressions, no. 8.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">CALYPSO.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Calypso was a sea-nymph, which name denotes a numerous class of
 female divinities of lower rank, yet sharing many of the attributes of
 the gods. Calypso received Ulysses hospitably, entertained him
 magnificently, became enamoured of him, and wished to retain him for
 ever, conferring on him immortality. But be persisted in his
 resolution to return to his country and his wife and son. Calypso at
 last received the command of Jove to dismiss him. Mercury brought
 the message to her, and found her in her grotto, which is thus
 described by Homer:
 
 </p>
         "A garden vine, luxuriant on all sides,<br>
          Mantled the spacious cavern, cluster-hung<br>
          Profuse; four fountains of serenest lymph,<br>
          Their sinuous course pursuing side by side,<br>
          Strayed all around, and everywhere appeared<br>
          Meadows of softest verdure, purpled o'er<br>
          With violets; it was a scene to fill<br>
          A god from heaven with wonder and delight."<br>
 
 <p>Calypso with much reluctance proceeded to obey the commands of
 Jupiter. She supplied Ulysses with the means of constructing a raft,
 provisioned it well for him, and gave him a favouring gale. He sped on
 his course prosperously for many days, till at length, when in sight
 of land, a storm arose that broke his mast, and threatened to rend the
 raft asunder. In this crisis he was seen by a compassionate sea-nymph,
 who in the form of a cormorant alighted on the raft, and presented him
 a girdle, directing him to bind it beneath his breast, and if he
 should be compelled to trust himself to the waves, it would buoy him
 up and enable him by swimming to reach the land.
 
 </p>
 <p>Fenelon, in his romance of "Telemachus," has given us the adventures
 of the son of Ulysses in search of his father. Among other places at
 which he arrived, following on his father's footsteps, was Calypso's
 isle, and, as in the former case, the goddess tried every art to
 keep him with her, and offered to share her immortality with him.
 But Minerva, who in the shape of Mentor accompanied him and governed
 all his movements, made him repel her allurements, and when no other
 means of escape could be found, the two friends leaped from a cliff
 into the sea, and swam to a vessel which lay becalmed off shore. Byron
 alludes to this leap of Telemachus and Mentor in the following stanza:
 
 </p>
         "But not in silence pass Calypso's isles,<br>
          The sister tenants of the middle deep;<br>
          There for the weary still a haven smiles,<br>
          Though the fair goddess long has ceased to weep,<br>
          And o'er her cliffs a fruitless watch to keep<br>
          For him who dared prefer a mortal bride.<br>
          Here too his boy essayed the dreadful leap,<br>
          Stern Mentor urged from high to yonder tide;<br>
          While thus of both bereft the nymph-queen doubly sighed."<br>
