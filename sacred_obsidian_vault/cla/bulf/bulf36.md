 <h2 align="CENTER">EASTERN MYTHOLOGY- ZOROASTER- HINDU MYTHOLOGY- CASTES-</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">BUDDHA- GRAND LAMA.</h3>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">ZOROASTER.</h3>
 
 <p>OUR knowledge of the religion of the ancient Persians is principally
 derived from the Zendavesta, or sacred books of that people. Zoroaster
 was the founder of their religion, or rather the reformer of the
 religion which preceded him. The time when he lived is doubtful, but
 it is certain that his system became the dominant religion of
 Western Asia from the time of Cyrus (550 B.C.) to the conquest of
 Persia by Alexander the Great. Under the Macedonian monarchy the
 doctrines of Zoroaster appear to have been considerably corrupted by
 the introduction of foreign opinions; but they afterwards recovered
 their ascendency.
 </p>
 <p>Zoroaster taught the existence of a supreme being, who created two
 other mighty beings and imparted to them as much of his own nature
 as seemed good to him. Of these, Ormuzd (called by the Greeks
 Oromasdes) remained faithful to his creator, and was regarded as the
 source of all good, while Ahriman (Arimanes) rebelled, and became
 the author of all evil upon the earth. Ormuzd created man and supplied
 him with all the materials of happiness; but Ahriman marred this
 happiness by introducing evil into the world, and creating savage
 beasts and poisonous reptiles and plants. In consequence of this, evil
 and good are now mingled together in every part of the world, and
 the followers of good and evil- the adherents of Ormuzd and Ahriman-
 carry on incessant war. But this state of things will not last for
 ever. The time will come when the adherents of Ormuzd shall everywhere
 be victorious, and Ahriman and his followers be consigned to
 darkness for ever.
 </p>
 <p>The religious rites of the ancient Persians were exceedingly simple.
 They used neither temples, altars, nor statues, and performed their
 sacrifices on the tops of mountains. They adored fire, light, and
 the sun as emblems of Ormuzd, the source of all light and purity,
 but did not regard them as independent deities. The religious rites
 and ceremonies were regulated by the priests, who were called Magi.
 The learning of the Magi was connected with astrology and enchantment,
 in which they were so celebrated that their name was applied to all
 orders of magicians and enchanters.
 </p>
 <p>Wordsworth thus alludes to the worship of the Persians:
 
 </p>
         "...the Persians,- zealous to reject<br>
          Altar and Image, and the inclusive walls<br>
          And roofs of temples built by human hands,-<br>
          The loftiest heights ascending, from their tops,<br>
          With myrtle-wreathed Tiara on his brows,<br>
          Presented sacrifice to Moon and Stars,<br>
          And to the Winds and mother Elements,<br>
          And the whole circle of the Heavens, for him<br>
          A sensitive existence and a God."<br>
                                      Excursion, Book IV.<br>
 
 <p>In "Childe Harold" Byron speaks thus of the Persian worship:
 
 </p>
         "Not vainly did the early Persian make<br>
          His altar the high places and the peak<br>
          Of earth-o'er-gazing mountains, and thus take<br>
          A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek<br>
          The Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak,<br>
          Upreared of human hands. Come and compare<br>
          Columns and idol-dwellings, Goth or Greek,<br>
          With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air,<br>
          Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer."<br>
                                                           III. 91.<br>
 
 <p>The religion of Zoroaster continued to flourish even after the
 introduction of Christianity, and in the third century was the
 dominant faith of the East, till the rise of the Mahometan power and
 the conquest of Persia by the Arabs in the seventh century, who
 compelled the greater number of the Persians to renounce their ancient
 faith. Those who refused to abandon the religion of their ancestors
 fled to the deserts of Kerman and to Hindustan, where they still exist
 under the name of Parsees, a name derived from Paris, the ancient name
 of Persia. The Arabs call them Guebers, from an Arabic word signifying
 unbelievers. At Bombay the Parsees are at this day a very active,
 intelligent, and wealthy class. For purity of life, honesty, and
 conciliatory manners, they are favourably distinguished. They have
 numerous temples to Fire, which they adore as the symbol of the
 divinity.
 </p>
 <p>The Persian religion makes the subject of the finest tale in Moore's
 "Lalla Rookh," the "Fire Worshippers." The Gueber chief says:
 
 </p>
           "Yes! I am of that impious race,<br>
              Those slaves of Fire, that morn and even<br>
            Hail their creator's dwelling-place<br>
              Among the living lights of heaven;<br>
            Yes I am of that outcast crew<br>
            To Iran and to vengeance true,<br>
            Who curse the hour your Arabs came<br>
            To desecrate our shrines of flame,<br>
            And swear before God's burning eye<br>
            To break our country's chains or die."<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">HINDU MYTHOLOGY.</h3>
 
 <p>The religion of the Hindus is professedly founded on the Vedas. To
 these books of their scripture they attach the greatest sanctity,
 and state that Brahma himself composed them at the creation. But the
 present arrangement of the Vedas is attributed to the sage Vyasa,
 about five thousand years ago.
 </p>
 <p>The Vedas undoubtedly teach the belief of one supreme God. The
 name of this deity is Brahma. His attributes are represented by the
 three personified powers of creation, preservation, and destruction,
 which under the respective names of Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva form
 the Trimurti or triad of principal Hindu gods. Of the inferior gods
 the most important are: 1. Indra, the god of heaven, of thunder,
 lightning, storm, and rain; 2. Agni, the god of fire; 3. Yama, the god
 of the infernal regions; 4. Surya, the god of the sun.
 </p>
 <p>Brahma is the creator of the universe, and the source from which all
 the individual deities have sprung, and into which all will ultimately
 be absorbed. "As milk changes to curd, and water to ice, so is
 Brahma variously transformed and diversified, without aid of
 exterior means of any sort." The human soul, according to the Vedas,
 is a portion of the supreme ruler, as a spark is of the fire.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">VISHNU.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Vishnu occupies the second place in the triad of the Hindus, and
 is the personification of the preserving principle. To protect the
 world in various epochs of danger, Vishnu descended to the earth in
 different incarnations, or bodily forms, which descents are called
 Avatars. They are very numerous, but ten are more particularly
 specified. The first Avatar was as Matsya, the Fish, under which
 form Vishnu preserved Manu, the ancestor of the human race, during a
 universal deluge. The second Avatar was in the form of a Tortoise,
 which form he assumed to support the earth when the gods were churning
 the sea for the beverage of immortality, Amrita.
 </p>
 <p>We may omit the other Avatars, which were of the same general
 character, that is, interpositions to protect the right or to punish
 wrong-doers, and come to the ninth, which is the most celebrated of
 the Avatars of Vishnu, in which he appeared in the human form of
 Krishna, an invincible warrior, who by his exploits relieved the earth
 from the tyrants who oppressed it.
 </p>
 <p>Buddha is by the followers of the Brahminical religion regarded as a
 delusive incarnation of Vishnu, assumed by him in order to induce
 the Asuras, opponents of the gods, to abandon the sacred ordinances of
 the Vedas, by which means they lost their strength and supremacy.
 </p>
 <p>Kalki is the name of the tenth Avatar, in which Vishnu will appear
 at the end of the present age of the world to destroy all vice and
 wickedness, and to restore mankind to virtue and purity.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">SIVA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Siva is the third person of the Hindu triad. He is the
 personification of the destroying principle. Though the third name, he
 is, in respect to the number of his worshippers and the extension of
 his worship, before either of the others. In the Puranas (the
 scriptures of the modern Hindu religion) no allusion is made to the
 original power of this god as a destroyer; that power not being to
 be called into exercise till after the expiration of twelve millions
 of years, or when the universe will come to an end; and Mahadeva
 (another name for Siva) is rather the representative of regeneration
 than of destruction.
 
 </p>
 <p>The worshippers of Vishnu and Siva form two sects, each of which
 proclaims the superiority of its favourite deity, denying the claims
 of the other, and Brahma, the creator, having finished his work, seems
 to be regarded as no longer active, and has now only one temple in
 India, while Mahadeva and Vishnu have many. The worshippers of
 Vishnu are generally distinguished by a greater tenderness for life,
 and consequent abstinence from animal food, and a worship less cruel
 than that of the followers of Siva.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">JUGGERNAUT.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Whether the worshippers of juggernaut are to be reckoned among the
 followers of Vishnu or Siva, our authorities differ. The temple stands
 near the shore, about three hundred miles southwest of Calcutta. The
 idol is a carved block of wood, with a hideous face, painted black,
 and a distended blood-red mouth. On festival days the throne of the
 image is placed on a tower sixty feet high, moving on wheels. Six long
 ropes are attached to the tower, by which the people draw it along.
 The priests and their attendants stand round the throne on the
 tower, and occasionally turn to the worshippers with songs and
 gestures. While the tower moves along numbers of the devout
 worshippers throw themselves on the ground, in order to be crushed
 by the wheels, and the multitude shout in approbation of the act, as a
 pleasing sacrifice to the idol. Every year, particularly at two
 great festivals in March and July, pilgrims flock in crowds to the
 temple. Not less than seventy or eighty thousand people are said to
 visit the place on these occasions, when all castes eat together.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">CASTES.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The division of the Hindus into classes or castes, with fixed
 occupations, existed from the earliest times. It is supposed by some
 to have been founded upon conquest, the first three castes being
 composed of a foreign race, who subdued the natives of the country and
 reduced them to an inferior caste. Others trace it to the fondness
 of perpetuating, by descent from father to son, certain offices or
 occupations.
 </p>
 <p>The Hindu tradition gives the following account of the origin of the
 various castes: At the creation Brahma resolved to give the earth
 inhabitants who should be direct emanations from his own body.
 Accordingly from his mouth came forth the eldest born, Brahma (the
 priest), to whom he confided the four Vedas; from his right arm issued
 Shatriya (the warrior), and from his left, the warrior's wife. His
 thighs produced Vaissyas, male and female (agriculturists and
 traders), and lastly from his feet sprang Sudras (mechanics and
 labourers).
 </p>
 <p>The four sons of Brahma, so significantly brought into the world,
 became the fathers of the human race, and heads of their respective
 castes. They were commanded to regard the four Vedas as containing all
 the rules of their faith, and all that was necessary to guide them
 in their religious ceremonies. They were also commanded to take rank
 in the order of their birth, the Brahmans uppermost, as having
 sprung from the head of Brahma.
 </p>
 <p>A strong line of demarcation is drawn between the first three castes
 and the Sudras. The former are allowed to receive instruction from the
 Vedas, which is not permitted to the Sudras. The Brahmans possess
 the privilege of teaching the Vedas, and were in former times in
 exclusive possession of all knowledge. Though the sovereign of the
 country was chosen from the Shatriya class, also called Rajputs, the
 Brahmans possessed the real power, and were the royal counsellors, the
 judges and magistrates of the country; their persons and property were
 inviolable; and though they committed the greatest crimes, they
 could only be banished from the kingdom. They were to be treated by
 sovereigns with the greatest respect, for "a Brahman, whether
 learned or ignorant, is a powerful divinity."
 </p>
 <p>When the Brahman arrives at years of maturity it becomes his duty to
 marry. He ought to be supported by the contributions of the rich,
 and not to be obliged to gain his subsistence by any laborious or
 productive occupation. But as all the Brahmans could not be maintained
 by the working classes of the community, it was found necessary to
 allow them to engage in productive employments.
 </p>
 <p>We need say little of the two intermediate classes, whose rank and
 privileges may be readily inferred from their occupations. The
 Sudras or fourth class are bound to servile attendance on the higher
 classes, especially the Brahmans, but they may follow mechanical
 occupations and practical arts, as painting and writing, or become
 traders or husbandmen. Consequently they sometimes grow rich, and it
 will also sometimes happen that Brahmans become poor. That fact
 works its usual consequence, and rich Sudras sometimes employ poor
 Brahmans in menial occupations.
 </p>
 <p>There is another class lower even than the Sudras, for it is not one
 of the original pure classes, but springs from an unauthorized union
 of individuals of different castes. These are the Pariahs, who are
 employed in the lowest services and treated with the utmost
 severity. They are compelled to do what no one else can do without
 pollution. They are not only considered unclean themselves, but they
 render unclean everything they touch. They are deprived of all civil
 rights, and stigmatized by particular laws regulating their mode of
 life, their houses, and their furniture. They are not allowed to visit
 the pagodas or temples of the other castes, but have their own pagodas
 and religious exercises. They are not suffered to enter the houses
 of the other castes; if it is done incautiously or from necessity, the
 place must be purified by religious ceremonies. They must not appear
 at public markets, and are confined to the use of particular wells,
 which they are obliged to surround with bones of animals, to warn
 others against using them. They dwell in miserable hovels, distant
 from cities and villages, and are under no restrictions in regard to
 food, which last is not a privilege, but a mark of ignominy, as if
 they were so degraded that nothing could pollute them. The three
 higher castes are prohibited entirely the use of flesh. The fourth
 is allowed to use all kinds except beef, but only the lowest caste
 is allowed every kind of food without restriction.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">BUDDHA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Buddha, whom the Vedas represent as a delusive incarnation of
 Vishnu, is said by his followers to have been a mortal sage, whose
 name was Gautama, called also by the complimentary epithets of
 Sakyasinha, the Lion, and Buddha, the Sage.
 </p>
 <p>By a comparison of the various epochs assigned to his birth, it is
 inferred that he lived about one thousand years before Christ.
 </p>
 <p>He was the son of a king; and when in conformity to the usage of the
 country he was, a few days after his birth, presented before the altar
 of a deity, the image is said to have inclined its head as a presage
 of the future greatness of the new-born prophet. The child soon
 developed faculties of the first order, and became equally
 distinguished by the uncommon beauty of his person. No sooner had he
 grown to years of maturity than he began to reflect deeply on the
 depravity and misery of mankind, and he conceived the idea of retiring
 from society and devoting himself to meditation. His father in vain
 opposed this design. Buddha escaped the vigilance of his guards, and
 having found a secure retreat, lived for six years undisturbed in
 his devout contemplations. At the expiration of that period he came
 forward at Benares as a religious teacher. At first some who heard him
 doubted of the soundness of his mind; but his doctrines soon gained
 credit, and were propagated so rapidly that Buddha himself lived to
 see them spread all over India. He died at the age of eighty years.
 </p>
 <p>The Buddhists reject entirely the authority of the Vedas, and the
 religious observances prescribed in them and kept by the Hindus.
 They also reject the distinction of castes, and prohibit all bloody
 sacrifices, and allow animal food. Their priests are chosen from all
 classes; they are expected to procure their maintenance by
 perambulation and begging, and among other things it is their duty
 to endeavour to turn to some use things thrown aside as useless by
 others, and to discover the medicinal power of plants. But in Ceylon
 three orders of priests are recognized; those of the highest order are
 usually men of high birth and learning, and are supported at the
 principal temples, most of which have been richly endowed by the
 former monarchs of the country.
 </p>
 <p>For several centuries after the appearance of buddha, his sect seems
 to have been tolerated by the Brahmans, and Buddhism appears to have
 penetrated the peninsula of Hindustan in every direction, and to
 have been carried to Ceylon, and to the eastern peninsula. But
 afterwards it had to endure in India a long-continued persecution,
 which ultimately had the effect of entirely abolishing it in the
 country where it had originated, but to scatter it widely over
 adjacent countries. Buddhism appears to have been introduced into
 China about the year 65 of our era. From China it was subsequently
 extended to Corea, Japan, and Java.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE GRAND LAMA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>It is a doctrine alike of the Brahminical Hindus and of the Buddhist
 sect that the confinement of the human soul, an emanation of the
 divine spirit, in a human body, is a state of misery, and the
 consequence of frailties and sins committed during former
 existences. But they hold that some few individuals have appeared on
 this earth from time to time, not under the necessity of terrestrial
 existence, but who voluntarily descended to the earth to promote the
 welfare of mankind. These individuals have gradually assumed the
 character of reappearances of Buddha himself, in which capacity the
 line is continued till the present day, in the several Lamas of
 Thibet, China, and other countries where Buddhism prevails. In
 consequence of the victories of Gengis Khan and his successors, the
 Lama residing in Thibet was raised to the dignity of chief pontiff
 of the sect. A separate province was assigned to him as his own
 territory, and besides his spiritual dignity he became to a limited
 extent a temporal monarch. He is styled the Dalai Lama.
 </p>
 <p>The first Christian missionaries who proceeded to Thibet were
 surprised to find there in the heart of Asia a pontifical court and
 several other ecclesiastical institutions resembling those of the
 Roman Catholic church. They found convents for priests and nuns,
 also processions and forms of religious worship, attended with much
 pomp and splendour; and many were induced by these similarities to
 consider Lamaism as a sort of degenerated Christianity. It is not
 improbable that the Lamas derived some of these practices from the
 Nestorian Christians, who were settled in Tartary when Buddhism was
 introduced into Thibet.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">PRESTER JOHN.</h3>
 
 
 <p>An early account, communicated probably by travelling merchants,
 of a Lama or spiritual chief among the Tartars, seems to have
 occasioned in Europe the report of a Presbyter or Prester John, a
 Christian pontiff resident in Upper Asia. The Pope sent a mission in
 search of him, as did also Louis IX of France, some years later, but
 both missions were unsuccessful, though the small communities of
 Nestorian Christians, which they did find, served to keep up the
 belief in Europe that such a personage did exist somewhere in the
 East. At last in the fifteenth century, a Portuguese traveller,
 Pedro Covilham, happening to hear that there was a Christian prince in
 the country of the Abessines (Abyssinia), not far from the Red Sea,
 concluded that this must be the true Prester John. He accordingly went
 thither, and penetrated to the court of the king, whom he calls Negus.
 Milton alludes to him in "Paradise Lost," Book XI., where,
 describing Adam's vision of his descendants in their various nations
 and cities, scattered over the face of the earth, he says,-
 
 </p>
             "...Nor did his eyes not ken<br>
              Th' empire of Negus, to his utmost port,<br>
              Ercoco, and the less maritime kings,<br>
              Mombaza and Quiloa and Melind."<br>
