 <h2 align="CENTER">NORTHERN MYTHOLOGY- VALHALLA- THE VALKYRIOR.</h2>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">NORTHERN MYTHOLOGY.</h3>
 
 <p>THE stories which have engaged our attention thus far relate to
 the mythology of southern regions. But there is another branch of
 ancient superstitions which ought not to be entirely overlooked,
 especially as it belongs to the nations from which we, through our
 English ancestors, derive our origin. It is that of the northern
 nations, called Scandinavians, who inhabited the countries now known
 as Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland. These mythological records
 are contained in two collections called the Eddas, of which the oldest
 is in poetry and dates back to the year 1O56, the more modern or prose
 Edda being of the date of 1640.
 </p>
 <p>According to the Eddas there was once no heaven above nor earth
 beneath, but only a bottomless deep, and a world of mist in which
 flowed a fountain. Twelve rivers issued from this fountain, and when
 they had flowed far from their source, they froze into ice, and one
 layer accumulating over another, the great deep was filled up.
 </p>
 <p>Southward from the world of mist was the world of light. From this
 flowed a warm wind upon the ice and melted it. The vapours rose in the
 air and formed clouds, from which sprang Ymir, the Frost giant and his
 progeny, and the cow Audhumbla, whose milk afforded nourishment and
 food to the giant. The cow got nourishment by licking the hoar frost
 and salt from the ice. While she was one day licking the salt stones
 there appeared at first the hair of a man, on the second day the whole
 head, and on the third the entire form endowed with beauty, agility,
 and power. This new being was a god, from whom and his wife, a
 daughter of the giant race, sprang the three brothers Odin, Vili,
 and Ve. They slew the giant Ymir, and out of his body formed the
 earth, of his blood the seas, of his bones the mountains, of his
 hair the trees, of his skull the heavens, and of his brain clouds,
 charged with hail and snow. Of Ymir's eyebrows the gods formed Midgard
 (mid earth), destined to become the abode of man.
 </p>
 <p>Odin then regulated the periods of day and night and the seasons
 by placing in the heavens the sun and moon, and appointing to them
 their respective courses. As soon as the sun began to shed its rays
 upon the earth, it caused the vegetable world to bud and sprout.
 Shortly after the gods had created the world they walked by the side
 of the sea, pleased with their new work, but found that it was still
 incomplete, for it was without human beings. They therefore took an
 ash tree and made a man out of it, and they made a woman out of an
 alder, and called the man Aske and the woman Embla. Odin then gave
 them life and soul, Vili reason and motion, and Ve bestowed upon
 them the senses, expressive features, and speech. Midgard was then
 given them as their residence, and they became the progenitors of
 the human race.
 </p>
 <p>The mighty ash tree Ygdrasill was supposed to support the whole
 universe. It sprang from the body of Ymir, and had three immense
 roots; extending one into Asgard (the dwelling of the gods), the other
 into Jotunheim (the abode of the giants), and the third to
 Niffleheim (the regions of darkness and cold). By the side of each
 of these roots is a spring, from which it is watered. The root that
 extends into Asgard is carefully tended by the three Norns, goddesses,
 who are regarded as the dispensers of fate. They are Urdur (the past),
 Verdandi (the present), Skuld (the future). The spring at the
 Jotunheim side is Ymir's well, in which wisdom and wit lie hidden, but
 that of Niffleheim feeds the adder Nidhogge (darkness), which
 perpetually gnaws at the root. Four harts run across the branches of
 the tree and bite the buds; they represent the four winds. Under the
 tree lies Ymir, and when he tries to shake off its weight the earth
 quakes.
 </p>
 <p>Asgard is the name of the abode of the gods, access to which is only
 gained by crossing the bridge Bifrost (the rainbow). Asgard consists
 of golden and silver palaces, the dwellings of the gods, but the
 most beautiful of these is Valhalla, the residence of Odin. When
 seated on his throne he overlooks all heaven and earth. Upon his
 shoulders are the ravens Hugin and Munin, who fly every day over the
 whole world, and on their return report to him all they have seen
 and heard. At his feet lie his two wolves, Geri and Freki, to whom
 Odin gives all the meat that is set before him, for he himself
 stands in no need of food. Mead is for him both food and drink. He
 invented the Runic characters, and it is the business of the Norns
 to engrave the runes of fate upon a metal shield. From Odin's name,
 spelt Woden, as it sometimes is, came Wednesday, the name of the
 fourth day of the week.
 </p>
 <p>Odin is frequently called Alfdaur (All-father), but this name is
 sometimes used in a way that shows that the Scandinavians had an
 idea of a deity superior to Odin, uncreated and eternal.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THE JOYS OF VALHALLA.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Valhalla is the great hall of Odin, wherein he feasts with his
 chosen heroes, all those who have fallen bravely in battle, for all
 who die a peaceful death are excluded. The flesh of the boar Schrimnir
 is served up to them, and is abundant for all. For although this
 boar is cooked every morning, be becomes whole again every night.
 For drink the heroes are supplied abundantly with mead from the
 she-goat Heidrum. When the heroes are not feasting they amuse
 themselves with fighting. Every day they ride out into the court or
 field and fight until they cut each other in pieces. This is their
 pastime; but when meal time comes they recover from their wounds and
 return to feast in Valhalla.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE VALKYRIOR.</h3>
 
 
 <p>The Valkyrior are warlike virgins, mounted upon horses and armed
 with helmets and spears. Odin, who is desirous to collect a great many
 heroes in Valhalla, to be able to meet the giants in a day when the
 final contest must come, sends down to every battlefield to make
 choice of those who shall be slain. The Valkyrior are his
 messengers, and their name means "Choosers of the slain." When they
 ride forth on their errand, their armour sheds a strange flickering
 light, which flashes up over the northern skies, making what men
 call the "Aurora Borealis," or "Northern Lights."*
 
 </p>
 <p>* Gray's ode, "The Fatal Sisters," is founded on this superstition.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF THOR AND THE OTHER GODS.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Thor, the thunderer, Odin's eldest son, is the strongest of gods and
 men, and possesses three very precious things. The first is a
 hammer, which both the Frost and the Mountain giants know to their
 cost, when they see it hurled against them in the air, for it has
 split many a skull of their fathers and kindred. When thrown, it
 returns to his hand of its own accord. The second rare thing he
 possesses is called the belt of strength. When he girds it about him
 his divine might is doubled. The third, also very precious, is his
 iron gloves, which he puts on whenever he would use his mallet
 efficiently. From Thor's name is derived our word Thursday.
 </p>
 <p>Frey is one of the most celebrated of the gods. He presides over
 rain and sunshine and all the fruits of the earth. His sister Freya is
 the most propitious of the goddesses. She loves music, spring, and
 flowers, and is particularly fond of the Elves (fairies). She is
 very fond of love ditties, and all lovers would do well to invoke her.
 </p>
 <p>Bragi is the god of poetry, and his song records the deeds of
 warriors. His wife, Iduna, keeps in a box the apples which the gods,
 when they feel old age approaching, have only to taste of to become
 young again.
 </p>
 <p>Heimdall is the watchman of the gods, and is therefore placed on the
 borders of heaven to prevent the giants from forcing their way over
 the bridge Bifrost (the rainbow). He requires less sleep than a
 bird, and sees by night as well as by day a hundred miles around
 him. So acute is his ear that no sound escapes him, for he can even
 hear the grass grow and the wool on a sheep's back.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">OF LOKI AND HIS PROGENY.</h3>
 
 
 <p>There is another deity who is described as the calumniator of the
 gods and the contriver of all fraud and mischief. His name is Loki. He
 is handsome and well made, but of a very fickle mood and most evil
 disposition. He is of the giant race, but forced himself into the
 company of the gods, and seems to take pleasure in bringing them
 into difficulties, and in extricating them out of the danger by his
 cunning, wit and skill. Loki has three children. The first is the wolf
 Fenris, the second the Midgard serpent, the third Hela (Death). The
 gods were not ignorant that these monsters were growing up, and that
 they would one day bring much evil upon gods and men. So Odin deemed
 it advisable to send one to bring them to him. When they came he threw
 the serpent into that deep ocean by which the earth is surrounded. But
 the monster had grown to such an enormous size that holding his tail
 in his mouth he encircles the whole earth. Hela he cast into
 Niffleheim, and gave her power over nine worlds or regions, into which
 she distributes those who are sent to her; that is, all who die of
 sickness or old age. Her hall is called Elvidner. Hunger is her table,
 Starvation her knife, Delay her man, Slowness her maid, Precipice
 her threshold, Care her bed, and Burning Anguish forms the hangings of
 the apartments. She may easily be recognized, for her body is half
 flesh colour and half blue, and she has a dreadfully stern and
 forbidding countenance.
 </p>
 <p>The wolf Fenris gave the gods a great deal of trouble before they
 succeeded in chaining him. He broke the strongest fetters as if they
 were made of cobwebs. Finally the gods sent a messenger to the
 mountain spirits, who made for them the chain called Gleipnir. It is
 fashioned of six things, viz., the noise made by the footfall of a
 cat, the beards of women, the roots of stones, the breath of fishes,
 the nerves (sensibilities) of bears, and the spittle of birds. When
 finished it was as smooth and soft as a silken string. But when the
 gods asked the wolf to suffer himself to be bound with this apparently
 slight ribbon, he suspected their design, fearing that it was made
 by enchantment. He therefore only consented to be bound with it upon
 condition that one of the gods put his hand in his (Fenris's) mouth as
 a pledge that the band was to be removed again. Tyr (the god of
 battles) alone had courage enough to do this. But when the wolf
 found that he could not break his fetters, and that the gods would not
 release him, he bit off Tyr's hand, and he has ever since remained
 one-handed.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">HOW THOR PAID THE MOUNTAIN GIANT HIS WAGES.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Once on a time, when the gods were constructing their abodes and had
 already finished Midgard and Valhalla, a certain artificer came and
 offered to build them a residence so well fortified that they should
 be perfectly safe from the incursions of the Frost giants and the
 giants of the mountains. But he demanded for his reward the goddess
 Freya, together with the sun and moon. The gods yielded to his
 terms, provided he would finish the whole work himself without any
 one's assistance, and all within the space of one winter. But if
 anything remained unfinished on the first day of summer he should
 forfeit the recompense agreed on. On being told these terms the
 artificer stipulated that he should be allowed the use of his horse
 Svadilfari, and this by the advice of Loki was granted to him. He
 accordingly set to work on the first day of winter, and during the
 night let his horse draw stone for the building. The enormous size
 of the stones struck the gods with astonishment, and they saw
 clearly that the horse did one-half more of the toilsome work than his
 master. Their bargain, however, had been concluded, and confirmed by
 solemn oaths, for without these precautions a giant would not have
 thought himself safe among the gods, especially when Thor should
 return from an expedition he had then undertaken against the evil
 demons.
 </p>
 <p>As the winter drew to a close, the building was far advanced, and
 the bulwarks were sufficiently high and massive to render the place
 impregnable. In short, when it wanted but three days to summer, the
 only part that remained to be finished was the gateway. Then sat the
 gods on their seats of justice and entered into consultation,
 inquiring of one another who among them could have advised to give
 Freya away, or to plunge the heavens in darkness by permitting the
 giant to carry away the sun and the moon.
 </p>
 <p>They all agreed that no one but Loki, the author of so many evil
 deeds, could have given such bad counsel, and that he should be put to
 a cruel death if he did not contrive some way to prevent the artificer
 from completing his task and obtaining the stipulated recompense. They
 proceeded to lay hands on Loki, who in his fright promised upon oath
 that, let it cost him what it would, he would so manage matters that
 the man should lose his reward. That very night when the man went with
 Svadilfari for building stone, a mare suddenly ran out of a forest and
 began to neigh. The horse thereat broke loose and ran after the mare
 into the forest, which obliged the man also to run after his horse,
 and thus between one and another the whole night was lost, so that
 at dawn the work had not made the usual progress. The man, seeing that
 he must fail of completing his task, resumed his own gigantic stature,
 and the gods now clearly perceived that it was in reality a mountain
 giant who had come amongst them. Feeling no longer bound by their
 oaths, they called on Thor, who immediately ran to their assistance,
 and lifting up his mallet, paid the workman his wages, not with the
 sun and moon, and not even by sending him back to Jotunheim, for
 with the first blow he shattered the giant's skull to pieces and
 hurled him headlong into Niffleheim.
 
 </p><h3 align="CENTER">THE RECOVERY OF THE HAMMER.</h3>
 
 
 <p>Once upon a time it happened that Thor's hammer fell into the
 possession of the giant Thrym, who buried it eight fathoms deep
 under the rocks of Jotunheim. Thor sent Loki to negotiate with
 Thrym, but he could only prevail so far as to get the giant's
 promise to restore the weapon if Freya would consent to be his
 bride. Loki returned and reported the result of his mission, but the
 goddess of love was quite horrified at the idea of bestowing her
 charms on the king of the Frost giants. In this emergency Loki
 persuaded Thor to dress himself in Freya's clothes and accompany him
 to Jotunheim. Thrym received his veiled bride with due courtesy, but
 was greatly surprised at seeing her eat for her supper eight salmons
 and a full grown ox, besides other delicacies, washing the whole
 down with three tuns of mead. Loki, however, assured him that she
 had not tasted anything for eight long nights, so great was her desire
 to see her lover, the renowned ruler of Jotunheim. Thrym had at length
 the curiosity to peep under his bride's veil, but started back in
 affright and demanded why Freya's eyeballs glistened with fire. Loki
 repeated the same excuse and the giant was satisfied. He ordered the
 hammer to be brought in and laid on the maiden's lap. Thereupon Thor
 threw off his disguise, grasped his redoubted weapon, and
 slaughtered Thrym and all his followers.
 </p>
 <p>Frey also possessed a wonderful weapon, a sword which would of
 itself spread a field with carnage whenever the owner desired it. Frey
 parted with this sword, but was less fortunate than Thor and never
 recovered it. It happened in this way: Frey once mounted Odin's
 throne, from whence one can see over the whole universe, and looking
 round saw far off in the giant's kingdom a beautiful maid, at the
 sight of whom he was struck with sudden sadness, insomuch that from
 that moment he could neither sleep, nor drink, nor speak. At last
 Skirnir, his messenger, drew his secret from him, and undertook to get
 him the maiden for his bride, if he would give him his sword as a
 reward. Frey consented and gave him the sword, and Skirnir set off
 on his journey and obtained the maiden's promise that within nine
 nights she would come to a certain place and there wed Frey. Skirnir
 having reported the success of his errand, Frey exclaimed:
 
 </p>
               "Long is one night,<br>
                Long are two nights,<br>
                But how shall I hold out three?<br>
                Shorter hath seemed<br>
                A month to me oft<br>
                Than of this longing time the half."<br>
 
 <p>So Frey obtained Gerda, the most beautiful of all women, for his
 wife, but he lost his sword.
 
 </p>
 <p>This story, entitled "Skirnir For," and the one immediately
 preceding it, "Thrym's Quida," will be found poetically told in
 Longfellow's "Poets and Poetry of Europe."
