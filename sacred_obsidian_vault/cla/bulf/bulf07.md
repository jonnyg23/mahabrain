 <h2 align="CENTER">PYGMALION- DRYOPE- VENUS AND ADONIS- APOLLO AND</h2>
 <h3 align="CENTER">HYACINTHUS.</h3>
 
 <p>PYGMALION saw so much to blame in women that he came at last to
 abhor the sex, and resolved to live unmarried. He was a sculptor,
 and had made with wonderful skill a statue of ivory, so beautiful that
 no living woman came anywhere near it. It was indeed the perfect
 semblance of a maiden that seemed to be alive, and only prevented from
 moving by modesty. His art was so perfect that it concealed itself and
 its product looked like the workmanship of nature. Pygmalion admired
 his own work, and at last fell in love with the counterfeit
 creation. Oftentimes he laid his hand upon it as if to assure
 himself whether it were living or not, and could not even then believe
 that it was only ivory. He caressed it, and gave it presents such as
 young girls love,- bright shells and polished stones, little birds and
 flowers of various hues, beads and amber. He put raiment on its limbs,
 and jewels on its fingers, and a necklace about its neck. To the
 ears he hung earrings, and strings of pearls upon the breast. Her
 dress became her, and she looked not less charming than when
 unattired. He laid her on a couch spread with cloths of Tyrian dye,
 and called her his wife, and put her head upon a pillow of the softest
 feathers, as if she could enjoy their softness.
 </p>
 <p>The festival of Venus was at hand- a festival celebrated with
 great pomp at Cyprus. Victims were offered, the altars smoked, and the
 odour of incense filled the air. When Pygmalion had performed his part
 in the solemnities, he stood before the altar and timidly said, "Ye
 gods, who can do all things, give me, I pray you, for my wife"- he
 dared not say "my ivory virgin," but said instead- "one like my
 ivory virgin." Venus, who was present at the festival, heard him and
 knew the thought he would have uttered; and as an omen of her
 favour, caused the flame on the altar to shoot up thrice in a fiery
 point into the air. When he returned home, he went to see his
 statue, and leaning over the couch, gave a kiss to the mouth. It
 seemed to be warm. He pressed its lips again, he laid his hand upon
 the limbs; the ivory felt soft to his touch and yielded to his fingers
 like the wax of Hymettus. While he stands astonished and glad,
 though doubting, and fears he may be mistaken, again and again with
 a lover's ardour he touches the object of his hopes. It was indeed
 alive! The veins when pressed yielded to the finger and again
 resumed their roundness. Then at last the votary of Venus found
 words to thank the goddess, and pressed his lips upon lips as real
 as his own. The virgin felt the kisses and blushed, and opening her
 timid eyes to the light, fixed them at the same moment on her lover.
 Venus blessed the nuptials she had formed, and from this union
 Paphos was born, from whom the city, sacred to Venus, received its
 name.
 
 </p>
 <p>Schiller, in his poem the "Ideals," applies this tale of Pygmalion
 to the love of nature in a youthful heart. The following translation
 is furnished by a friend:
 
 </p>
           "As once with prayers in passion flowing,<br>
              Pygmalion embraced the stone,<br>
            Till from the frozen marble glowing,<br>
              The light of feeling o'er him shone,<br>
            So did I clasp with young devotion.<br>
              Bright nature to a poet's heart;<br>
            Till breath and warmth and vital motion<br>
              Seemed through the statue form to dart.<br>
 
           "And then, in all my ardour sharing,<br>
              The silent form expression found;<br>
            Returned my kiss of youth daring,<br>
              And understood my heart's quick sound.<br>
            Then lived for me the bright creation,<br>
              The silver rill with song was rife;<br>
            The trees, the roses shared sensation,<br>
              An echo of my boundless life."- S. G. B.<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">DRYOPE.</h3>
 
 <p>Dryope and Iole were sisters. The former was the wife of
 Andraemon, beloved by her husband, and happy in the birth of her first
 child. One day the sisters strolled to the bank of a stream that
 sloped gradually down to the water's edge, while the upland was
 overgrown with myrtles. They were intending to gather flowers for
 forming garlands for the altars of the nymphs, and Dryope carried
 her child at her bosom, precious burden, and nursed him as she walked.
 Near the water grew a lotus plant, full of purple flowers. Dryope
 gathered some and offered them to the baby, and Iole was about to do
 the same, when she perceived blood dropping from the places where
 her sister had broken them off the stem. The plant was no other than
 the nymph Lotis, who, running from a base pursuer, had been changed
 into this form. This they learned from the country people when it
 was too late.
 </p>
 <p>Dryope, horror-struck when she perceived what she had done, would
 gladly have hastened from the spot, but found her feet rooted to the
 ground. She tried to pull them away, but moved nothing but her upper
 limbs. The woodiness crept upward and by degrees invested her body. In
 anguish she attempted to tear her hair, but found her hands filled
 with leaves. The infant felt his mother's bosom begin to harden, and
 the milk cease to flow. Iole looked on at the sad fate of her
 sister, and could render no assistance. She embraced the growing
 trunk, as if she would hold back the advancing wood, and would
 gladly have been enveloped in the same bark. At this moment Andraemon,
 the husband of Dryope, with her father, approached; and when they
 asked for Dryope, Iole pointed them to the new-formed lotus. They
 embraced the trunk of the yet warm tree, and showered their kisses
 on its leaves.
 </p>
 <p>Now there was nothing left of Dryope but her face. Her tears still
 flowed and fell on her leaves, and while she could she spoke. "I am
 not guilty. I deserve not this fate. I have injured no one. If I speak
 falsely, may my foliage perish with drought and my trunk be cut down
 and burned. Take this infant and give it to a nurse. Let it often be
 brought and nursed under my branches, and play in my shade; and when
 he is old enough to talk, let him be taught to call me mother, and
 to say with sadness, 'My mother lies hid under this bark.' But bid him
 be careful of river banks, and beware how he plucks flowers,
 remembering that every bush he sees may be a goddess in disguise.
 Farewell, dear husband, and sister, and father. If you retain any love
 for me, let not the axe wound me, nor the flocks bite and tear my
 branches. Since I cannot stoop to you, climb up hither and kiss me;
 and while my lips continue to feel, lift up my child that I may kiss
 him. I can speak no more, for already the bark advances up my neck,
 and will soon shoot over me. You need not close my eyes, the bark will
 close them without your aid." Then the lips ceased to move, and life
 was extinct: but the branches retained for some time longer the
 vital heat.
 
 </p>
 <p>Keats, in "Endymion," alludes to Dryope thus:
 
 </p>
           "She took a lute from which there pulsing came<br>
            A lively prelude, fashioning the way<br>
            In which her voice should wander. 'Twas a lay<br>
            More subtle-cadenced, more forest-wild<br>
            Than Dryope's lone lulling of her child;" etc.<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">VENUS AND ADONIS</h3>
 
 <p>Venus, playing one day with her boy Cupid, wounded her bosom with
 one of his arrows. She pushed him away, but the wound was deeper
 than she thought. Before it healed she beheld Adonis, and was
 captivated with him. She no longer took any interest in her
 favourite resorts- Paphos, and Cnidos, and Amathos, rich in metals.
 She absented herself even from heaven, for Adonis was dearer to her
 than heaven. Him she followed and bore him company. She who used to
 love to recline in the shade, with no care but to cultivate her
 charms, now rambles through the woods and over the hills, dressed like
 the huntress Diana; and calls her dogs, and chases hares and stags, or
 other game that it is safe to hunt, but keeps clear of the wolves
 and bears, reeking with the slaughter of the herd. She charged Adonis,
 too, to beware of such dangerous animals. "Be brave towards the
 timid," said she; "courage against the courageous is not safe.
 Beware how you expose yourself to danger and put my happiness to risk.
 Attack not the beasts that Nature has armed with weapons. I do not
 value your glory so high as to consent to purchase it by such
 exposure. Your youth, and the beauty that charms Venus, will not touch
 the hearts of lions and bristly boars. Think of their terrible claws
 and prodigious strength! I hate the whole race of them. Do you ask
 me why?" Then she told him the story of Atalanta and Hippomenes, who
 were changed into lions for their ingratitude to her.
 </p>
 <p>Having given him this warning, she mounted her chariot drawn by
 swans, and drove away through the air. But Adonis was too noble to
 heed such counsels. The dogs had roused a wild boar from his lair, and
 the youth threw his spear and wounded the animal with sidelong stroke.
 The beast drew out the weapon with his jaws, and rushed after
 Adonis, who turned and ran; but the boar overtook him, and buried
 his tusks in his side, and stretched him dying upon the plain.
 </p>
 <p>Venus, in her swan-drawn chariot, had not yet reached Cyprus, when
 she heard coming up through mid-air the groans of her beloved, and
 turned her white-winged coursers back to earth. As she drew near and
 saw from on high his lifeless body bathed in blood, she alighted
 and, bending over it, beat her breast and tore her hair. Reproaching
 the Fates, she said, "Yet theirs shall be but a partial triumph;
 memorials of my grief shall endure, and the spectacle of your death,
 my Adonis, and of my lamentation shall be annually renewed. Your blood
 shall be changed into a flower; that consolation none can envy me."
 Thus speaking, she sprinkled nectar on the blood; and as they mingled,
 bubbles rose as in a pool on which raindrops fall, and in an hour's
 time there sprang up a flower of bloody hue like that of the
 pomegranate. But it is short-lived. It is said the wind blows the
 blossoms open, and afterwards blows the petals away; so it is called
 Anemone, or Wind Flower, from the cause which assists equally in its
 production and its decay.
 
 </p>
 <p>Milton alludes to the story of Venus and Adonis in his "Comus":
 
 </p>
             "Beds of hyacinth and roses<br>
              Where young Adonis oft reposes,<br>
              Waxing well of his deep wound<br>
              In slumber soft, and on the ground<br>
              Sadly sits th' Assyrian queen;" etc.<br>
 
 <h3 align="CENTER">APOLLO AND HYACINTHUS.</h3>
 
 <p>Apollo was passionately fond of a youth named Hyacinthus. He.
 accompanied him in his sports, carried the nets when he went
 fishing, led the dogs when he went to hunt, followed him in his
 excursions in the mountains, and neglected for him his lyre and his
 arrows. One day they played a game of quoits together, and Apollo,
 heaving aloft the discus, with strength mingled with skill, sent it
 high and far. Hyacinthus watched it as it flew, and excited with the
 sport ran forward to seize it, eager to make his throw, when the quoit
 bounded from the earth and struck him in the forehead. He fainted
 and fell. The god, as pale as himself, raised him and tried all his
 art to stanch the wound and retain the flitting life, but all in vain;
 the hurt was past the power of medicine. As when one has broken the
 stem of a lily in the garden it hangs its head and turns its flowers
 to the earth, so the head of the dying boy, as if too heavy for his
 neck, fell over on his shoulder. "Thou diest, Hyacinth," so spoke
 Phoebus, "robbed of thy youth by me. Thine is the suffering, mine
 the crime. Would that I could die for thee! But since that may not be,
 thou shalt live with me in memory and in song. My lyre shall celebrate
 thee, my song shall tell thy fate, and thou shalt become a flower
 inscribed with my regrets." While Apollo spoke, behold the blood which
 had flowed on the ground and stained the herbage ceased to be blood;
 but a flower of hue more beautiful than the Tyrian sprang up,
 resembling the lily, if it were not that this is purple and that
 silvery white.* And this was not enough for Phoebus; but to confer
 still greater honour, he marked the petals with his sorrow, and
 inscribed "Ah! ah!" upon them, as we see to this day. The flower bears
 the name of Hyacinthus, and with every returning spring revives the
 memory of his fate.
 
 </p>
 <p>* It is evidently not our modern hyacinth that is here described. It
 is perhaps some species of iris, or perhaps of larkspur or pansy.
 
 </p>
 <p>It was said that Zephyrus (the West wind), who was also fond of
 Hyacinthus and jealous of his preference of Apollo, blew the quoit out
 of its course to make it strike Hyacinthus. Keats alludes to this in
 his "Endymion," where he describes the lookers-on at the game of
 quoits:
 
 </p>
           "Or they might watch the quoit-pitchers, intent<br>
              On either side, pitying the sad death<br>
              Of Hyacinthus, when the cruel breath<br>
            Of Zephyr slew him; Zephyr penitent,<br>
            Who now ere Phoebus mounts the firmament,<br>
              Fondles the flower amid the sobbing rain."<br>
 
 <p>An allusion to Hyacinthus will also be recognized in Milton's
 "Lycidas":
 
 </p>
         "Like to that sanguine flower inscribed with woe."<br>
