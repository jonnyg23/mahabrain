 <p>IF there be anyone among you who is ignorant of the art of loving, let him   read this poem and, having read it and acquired the knowledge it contains,   let him address himself to Love.</p>   
 <p>By art the swift ships are propelled with sail and oar; there is art in driving   the fleet chariots, and Love should by art be guided. Automedon was a skilled   charioteer and knew how to handle the flowing reins; Tiphys was the pilot of   the good ship Argo. I have been appointed by Venus as tutor to tender Love. I   shall be known as the Tiphys and Automedon of Love. Love is somewhat   recalcitrant and ofttimes refuses to do my bidding; but ’tis a boy, and   boys are easily moulded. Chiron brought up the boy Achilles to the music of   the lyre, and by that peaceful art softened his wild nature; he, before whom   his enemies were destined so oft to tremble, who many a time struck terror   even into his own companions was, so ’tis said, timid and submissive in   the presence of a feeble old man, obedient to his master's voice, and held   out to him for chastisement those hands whereof Hector was one day destined   to feel the weight. Chiron was tutor to Achilles; I am tutor to Love; both of   them formidable youngsters, both of them goddess-born. But the fiery bull has   to submit to the yoke; the mettled steed vainly champs at the curb that   masters him. I, too, will bring Love to heel, even though his arrows pierce   my breast and he brandish over my head his flaming torch. The keener his   arrows, the fiercer his fires, the more they stir me to avenge my wounds.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_98"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 98</font></a></p>   
 <p>I shall not try, O Apollo, to convey the notion that it was from thee I   learned the art which I impart; no birds came and sang it in my ear. Clio and   her sisters appeared not to me, grazing my herds, O Ascra, in thy vales.   Experience is my guide; give ear to the adept; true are the things I sing.   Mother of Love, smile on my undertaking.</p>   
 <p>Hence, ye narrow frontlets, insignia of chastity, and ye trailing robes   that half conceal the feet. I sing of love where danger is not; I sing   permitted pilferings; free of all offence my verses are.</p>   
 <p>You, who for the first time are taking up arms beneath the standard of   Venus, find out, in the first place, the woman you are fain to love. Your   next task will be to bend her to your will; your third to safeguard that your   love shall endure. This is my plan, my syllabus. This is the course my   chariot will pursue; such is the goal that it will endeavour to attain.</p>   
 <p>Now, that you still are fancy-free, now is the time for you to choose a   woman and say to her: "You are the only woman that I care for."   She's not going to be wafted down to you from heaven on the wings of the   wind. You must use your own-eyes to discover the girl that suits you. The   hunter knows where to spread his nets in order to snare the stag; he knows   the valley where the wild boar has his lair. The birdcatcher knows where he   should spread his lime; and the fisherman, what waters most abound in fish.   And thou who seekest out the object of a lasting love, learn to know the   places which the fair ones most do haunt. You won't have to put to sea in   order to do that, or to undertake any distant journeys. Perseus may bring   home his Andromeda from sun-scorched India, and the Phrygian swain may go to   Greece to bear away his bride; Rome alone will give you a choice of such   lovely women, and so many of them, that you will be forced to confess that   she</p>   
 <p><a name="page_99"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 99</font></a></p>   
 <p>gathers within her own bosom all the treasures that the world can show. As   numerous as the ears of corn on Gargarus, grapes in Methymna, fish in the   ocean, birds in the thickets, stars in the heavens, so numerous are the   beautiful girls you'll find in Rome: Venus has made her seat of empire the   city of her beloved Æneas.</p>   
 <p>If your. tastes incline to a young beauty, in the very flower of girlhood,   a really inexperienced girl will offer herself to your gaze; if you prefer   one rather more mature, there are hundreds of young women who will take your   fancy: ’twill be a veritable <i>embarras de richesses</i>. But perhaps   you would rather have someone still older, still more experienced. In that   case you've got a yet larger number to choose from. When the sun begins to   enter the sign of the Lion, you've only got to take a stroll beneath the cool   shade of Pompey's portico, or near that building adorned with foreign marbles   erected by a loving mother who united her offerings to those of a dutiful   son. Omit not to visit that portico which, adorned with ancient pictures, is   called the portico of Livia, after its foundress. There you will see the   Danaides plotting the death of their unhappy kinswomen, and their fell sire   grasping in his hand a naked sword. And do not miss the festival of Adonis,   mourned of Venus, and the rites celebrated every seventh day by the Syrian   Jews.</p>   
 <p>Shun not the Temple of the Cow of Memphis, who persuades so many women to   play the part she played to Jupiter. Even the Forum, strange though it sound,   is propitious to love-making. Lawyers are by no means proof against the fiery   shafts of Love. Hard by the marble temple sacred to Venus, where play the   waters of the Appian fount, many an advocate has fallen a victim to the   snares of Love; for the man who defends his client cannot always defend   himself. In such a pass, words sometimes fail even the most learned orator.   The tables are turned and he finds himself obliged to plead his own</p>   
 <p><a name="page_100"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 100</font></a></p>   
 <p>cause. From her temple close at hand, Venus laughs to see him in such a   quandary. A patron but a little while ago, he would now rejoice to be a   client.</p>   
 <p>But it is especially at the theatre you should lay your snares; that is   where you may hope to have your desires fulfilled. Here you will find women   to your taste: one for a moment's dalliance, another to fondle and caress,   another to have all for your own. Even as the ants that come and go in long   battalions with their stores of food, or as the bees, when they have found   plants to plunder of their honey, hover hither and thither among the thyme   and the flowers, so, and no less numerous, you may see crowds of lovely   women, gaily dressed, hastening away to the theatre. I have often found it   difficult to choose from such a galaxy. They come to see and, more important   still, to be seen! The theatre's the place where modesty acts a fall.</p>   
 <p>It was you, Romulus, who first mingled the cares of love with public   games, that far-off day when the rape of the Sabine women gave wives to your   warriors who had waited for them so long. No curtains then hung in the marble   theatre, nor was the stage made red with liquid saffron. In those days   branches from the woods of the Palatine were the only adornment of our simple   stage. The people sat on seats of turf, their heads canopied with boughs.</p>   
 <p>As soon as he had sat him down, each Roman looked about, marking the woman   whom he most desired, giving free play to the thoughts that surged within   him. Whilst to the sound of a rustic pipe an actor strikes his foot three   times upon the levelled earth, amid the unforced applause of the expectant   throng (for in those days applause was neither bought nor sold), Romulus   signed to his men to seize upon their prey. In a trice, with shouts that made   their object clear, they laid their eager hands upon the cowering women. Even   as the weak and timid doves flee</p>

 <p><a name="page_101"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 101</font></a></p>   
 <p>before an eagle, even as a young lamb quails at the sight of a wolf, so   shuddered the Sabine women when they beheld these fierce warriors making   towards them. Every one turned pale, terror spread throughout the throng, but   it showed itself in different ways. Some tore their hair; some swooned away;   some wept in silence; some called vainly for their mothers; some sobbed   aloud; others seemed stupefied with fear; some stood transfixed; others tried   to flee. Nevertheless, the Romans carry off the women, sweet booty for their   beds, and to many of them, terror lends an added charm.</p>   
 <p>If one shows herself too rebellious and refuses to follow her ravisher, he   picks her up and, pressing her lovingly to his bosom, exclaims, "Why   with tears do you thus dim the lovely radiance of your eyes? What your father   is to your mother, that will I be to you." O Romulus, you are the only   one who has ever known how to reward his soldiers; for such pay, I would   willingly enrol myself beneath your banners. Ever since those days, the   theatres, faithful to this ancient custom, have always been a dangerous lure   to loveliness.</p>   
 <p>Forget not the arena where mettled steeds strive for the palm of Victory.   This circus, where an immense concourse of people is gathered, is very   favourable to Love. There, if you would express the secret promptings of your   heart, there is no need for you to talk upon your fingers, or to watch for   signs to tell you what is in your fair one's mind. Sit close beside her, as   close as you are able; there's nothing to prevent. The narrowness of the   space compels you to press against her and, fortunately for you, compels her to   acquiesce. Then, of course, you must think of some means of starting the   conversation. Begin by saying the sort of thing people generally do say on   such occasions. Some horses are seen entering the stadium; ask her the name   of their owner; and whoever she favours, you should follow suit. And when the   solemn procession of the country's gods and goddesses</p>   
 <p><a name="page_102"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 102</font></a></p>   
 <p>passes along, be sure and give a rousing cheer for Venus, your   protectress. If, as not infrequently befalls, a speck of dust lights on your   fair one's breast, flick it off with an airy finger; and if there's nothing   there, flick it off just the same; anything is good enough to serve as a   pretext for paying her attention. Is her dress dragging on the ground? Gather   it up, and take special care that nothing soils it. Perchance, to reward you   for your kindness, she'll grant you the favour of letting you see her leg.   And then again, you must keep an eye on the people seated in the row behind   and see that no one thrusts his knee into her soft shoulders. The merest   trifle is enough to win these butterfly ladies. Why, hosts of men have   succeeded with a woman merely by the attentive manner in which they have   arranged a cushion for her, or fanned her with a fan, or put a stool beneath   her dainty feet. Both the circus and the forum afford opportunities for a   love-affair. Love often delights to try his strength there, and many a man,   who came to see another wounded, finds that he has been pinked himself. While   he is talking and stroking her hand, asking for the race-card and, having put   his money on, is inquiring what has won, an arrow pierces him before he knows   where he is; he heaves a sigh and, instead of being a mere spectator of the   combat, he finds himself a victim.</p>   
 <p>Did we not see this happen quite recently, when Caesar offered us the   spectacle of a sea-fight showing the Persian and the Athenian ships in   action. Then indeed, from both seas, youths and maidens flocked to see the   show and the whole world was gathered within the City. Which of us, in that   vast throng, found not a woman worthy of his love; and, alas, how many were   tortured by a foreign flame.</p>   
 <p>But lo, Caesar makes ready to complete the conquest of the world! Ye   far-off countries of the East, to our laws shall ye submit; and you, ye   arrogant Parthians, shall be punished as ye deserve. Rejoice, shades of   Crassus, and</p>   
 <p><a name="page_103"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 103</font></a></p>   
 <p>you, ye Roman Eagles, ashamed at your long sojourn in barbarian hands, be   of good cheer, your avenger is at hand. Scarce has he essayed to wield his   arms, and yet he proves himself a skilful leader. Though he himself is but a   boy, he wages a war unsuited to his boyish years. O, ye of little faith, vex   not your souls about the age of the gods! Courage in a Caesar does not wait   upon the years. Genius divine outpaces time and brooks not the tedium of   tardy growth. Hercules was still no more than a child when he 'crushed the   serpents in his baby hands. Even in the cradle he proved himself a worthy son   of Jove. And you, Bacchus, still glowing with youthful radiance, how mighty   wast thou when India trembled at thy conquering Thyrsi! With the auspices and   with the courage of thy sire shalt thou wield thine arms, young Caesar; with   the courage and with the auspices of thy sire shalt thou overthrow thine   enemies. Such a beginning becomes the name thou bearest. To-day thou art   Prince of the Youths; one day thou shalt be Prince of the Elders. Since thou   hast brothers, avenge thy slaughtered brethren; and since thou hast a sire,   defend thy father's rights. It is thy father, thy country's father, who hath   armed thee, what time the foe is violently wrestling the sceptre from a   parent's struggling hand. Thy sacred cause shall triumph o’er the   perjured foe; justice and piety shall march beneath thy standards. The righteousness   of our cause shall overcome the Parthians; arms shall drive the victory home,   and so to Latium's riches, the wealth of the Orient shall my young hero add.   Mars, his sire, and thou Caesar, his sire too, a god the one, the other soon   a god to be, watch over him and keep him from all harm. I can read the hidden   secrets of the future. Aye, thou wilt conquer. I will sing thy glory in   verses consecrate to thee; with a loud voice I will sound thy praise.   Standing erect will I depict thee, and urging thy warriors to the combat.   Grant that my song be not unworthy of the prowess that it celebrates! I</p>   
 <p><a name="page_104"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 104</font></a></p>   
 <p>will sing of the Parthian turning to flee, and of the Roman facing the   arrows aimed at him by the flying foe. What, Parthian, dost thou leave to the   conquered, who seekest victory in flight? Henceforth, for thee Mars   forebodeth nought but ill.</p>   
 <p>That day shall dawn, O fairest of mankind, when, resplendent with gold, by   four white horses drawn, thou shalt pass within the City walls. Before thee,   laden with chains, shall walk the conquered leaders; nor shall they then, as   erst they did, seek safety in flight. Young men and maidens shall with joy   behold the sight, and with gladness shall all hearts be filled. Then if some   fair one shall ask of thee the name of this or that defeated monarch, what   all these emblems mean, what country this, what mountain that, or what that   river yonder represents, answer at once, anticipate her questions, speak up   with confidence, and even when your mind's a blank, speak up as if you had the   knowledge pat. " Here's the Euphrates, with his sedgy crown; and that   old fellow there, with sky-blue hair, why, he's the Tigris; and those? . .   hum! . . . well, they're Armenians. That woman yonder? She is Persia, where   the son of Danaë was born. That town till lately rose up amid the vales   of Achæmenes. That prisoner there, or that other one yonder? Oh., they   are captured generals." And if you know them, give their names. If you   don't, invent them.</p>   
 <p>Dinners and banquets offer easy access to women's favour, and the   pleasures of the grape are not the only entertainment you may find there;   Love, with rosy cheeks, often presses in her frail hands the amphora of   Bacchus. As soon as his wings are drenched with wine, Cupid grows drowsy and   stirs not from his place. But anon he'll be up and shaking the moisture from   his wings, and woe betide the man or woman who receives a sprinkling of this   burning dew. Wine fills the heart with thoughts of love and makes it prompt   to catch on fire. All troubles vanish, put to flight by copious draughts.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_105"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 105</font></a></p>   
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Then is the time for laughter, the poor man plucks up courage and   imagines he's a millionaire. To the deuce with worries and troubles! Brows   unpucker and hearts expand; every tongue's inspired by frankness, and calls a   spade a spade. We've often lost our heart to a pretty girl at dinner.   Bringing love and wine together is adding fuel to fire indeed. Don't judge a   woman by candle-light, it's deceptive. If you really want to know what she's   like, look at her by daylight, and when you're sober. It was broad daylight,   and under the open sky, that Paris looked upon the three goddesses and said   to Venus, "You are lovelier than your two rivals." Night covers a   multitude of blemishes and imperfections. At night there is no such thing as   an ugly woman! If you want to look at precious stones, or coloured cloth, you   take them out into the light of day; and it's by daylight you should judge a   woman's face and figure.</p>   
 <p>But if I'm to mention all the places favourable to woman-hunting, I might   as well attempt to number the sands of the seashore. Of course, there's   Baiæ, with white sails gleaming out in the bay, and its hot sulphur   spring. Many a bather, who has gone there for his health, comes away saying,   "Those precious baths are not such healthy things as people make   out." Not far from the gates of Rome, behold the temple of Diana shaded   by trees, the scene of many a hard-fought contest for the prize of Love.   Because she's a virgin and hates the darts of Love, Diana has inflicted many   a wound there, and will inflict many more.</p>   
 <p>Thus far my Muse, borne in her chariot with wheels of different height,   has, told you, would-be lover, where to seek your prey, and how to lay your   snares. Now I'll teach you how to captivate and hold the woman of your   choice. This is the most important part of all my lessons. Lovers of every   land, lend an attentive ear to my discourse; let goodwill warm your hearts,   for I am going to fulfil the promises I made you.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_106"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 106</font></a></p>   
 <p>First of all, be quite sure that there isn't a woman who cannot be won,   and make up your mind that you will win her. Only you must prepare the   ground. Sooner would the birds cease their song in the springtime, or the   grasshopper be silent in the summer, or the hare turn and give chase to a hound   of Mænalus, than a woman resist the tender wooing of a youthful lover.   Perhaps you think she doesn't want to yield. You're wrong. She wants to. in   her heart of hearts. Stolen love is just as sweet to women as it is to us.   Man is a poor dissembler; woman is much more skilful in concealing her   desire. If all the men agreed that they would never more make the first   advance, the women would soon be fawning at our feet. Out in the springy   meadow the heifer lows with longing for the bull; the mare neighs at the   approach of the stallion. With men and women love is more restrained, and   passion is less fierce. They keep within bounds. Need I mention Byblis, who   burned for her brother with an incestuous flame, and hanged herself to   expiate her crime? Or Myrrha, who loved her father, but not as a father   should be loved, and now her shame is hidden by the bark of the tree that   covered her. O sweetly scented tree, the tears which she distils, to us give   perfume and recall the ill-fated maid's unhappy name.</p>   
 <p>One day in wood-crowned Ida's shady vale, a white bull went wandering by.   The pride of all the herd was he. Between his horns was just a single spot of   black; save for that mark, his body was as white as milk; and all the heifers   of Gnossus and of Cydonia sighed for the joy of his caress. Pasiphaë   conceived a passion for him and viewed with jealous eye the loveliest among   the heifers. There's no gainsaying it, Crete with her hundred cities, Crete,   liar though she be, cannot deny it. ’Tis said that Pasiphaë, with   hands unused to undertake such toil, tore from the trees their tenderest   shoots, culled from the meadows bunches of sweet grass and hastened to offer   them to her beloved bull. Whithersoever he went, she followed him;</p>   
 <p><a name="page_107"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 107</font></a></p>   
 <p>nothing would stay her. She recked not of her spouse; the bull had   conquered Minos. "What avails it, Pasiphaë, to deck yourself in   costly raiment? How can your lover of such riches judge? Wherefore, mirror in   hand, dost thou follow the wandering herd up to the mountain top? Wherefore   dost thou for ever range thy hair? Look in thy mirror: ’twill tell thee   thou art no meet mistress for a bull. Ah, what wouldst thou not have given if   Nature had but armed thy brow with horns! If Minos still doth hold a corner   in thy heart, cease this adulterous love; or if thou must deceive thy spouse,   at least deceive him with a man." She hearkens not, but, fleeing from   his royal couch, she ranges ever on and on, through forest after forest, like   to a Bacchante full of the spirit that unceasingly torments her. How often,   looking with jealous anger on a heifer, did she exclaim) "How then can   she find favour in his sight? See how she prances before him on the green.   Fool, she doubtless deems that thus she is lovelier in his eyes." Then,   at her command, the hapless beast is taken from the herd and sent to bow her   head beneath the yoke; or else, pretending to offer sacrifice to the gods,   she orders her to be slain; at the altar; and then with joy fingers   o’er the entrails of her rival. How often, under the guise of one who   offers sacrifice, hath she appeased the alleged displeasure of the gods, and   waving the bleeding trophies in her hand exclaimed, "Go, get thee to my   lover, please him now!" Now she would be Europa; now she would be lo;   the one because she was a heifer, the other because a bull bore her on his   back. Howbeit, deceived by the image of a cow of maple wood, the king of the   herd performed with her the act of love, and by the offspring was the sire   betrayed.</p>   
 <p>Had that other Cretan girl been able to forego her passion for Thyestes   (but how hard it is for a woman to love one man alone), Phœbus would not   have been compelled to stay his steeds in mid-career, and to have</p>   
 <p><a name="page_108"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 108</font></a></p>   
 <p>driven his chariot back again towards the Dawn. The daughter of Nisus,   because she had stolen from the father's head the fatal lock of hair, is   evermore beset by ravening dogs. The son of Atreus, though he escaped the   perils of the battlefield and the ocean, died beneath the dagger of his cruel   spouse. Who has listened to the love story of Creusa? Who has not hated the   mad fury of Medea, a mother stained with her children's blood? Phœnix,   the son of Amyntor, wept with his sightless orbs. You, ye steeds, in your   terror, tore Hippolytus in pieces. Wherefore, Phineus, didst thou put out the   eyes of thy innocent sons? Upon thine own head will that punishment return.</p>   
 <p>Such are the consequences of woman's unbridled passion. Fiercer it is than   ours, with more of frenzy in it.</p>   
 <p>Be, then, of good cheer, and never doubt that you will conquer. Not one   woman in a thousand will seriously resist. Whether a pretty woman grants or   withholds her favours, she always likes to be asked for them. Even if you are   repulsed, you don't run any danger. But why should a woman refuse? People   don't resist the temptation of new delights. We always deem that other people   are more fortunate than ourselves. The crop is always better in our   neighbour's field; his cows more rich in milk.</p>   
 <p>Now the first thing you have to do is to get on good terms with the fair   one's maid. She can make things easy for you. Find out whether she is fully   in her mistress's confidence, and if she knows all about her secret   dissipations. Leave no stone unturned to win her over. Once you have her on   your side, the rest is easy. Let her watch for a favourable time (that's a   precaution that doctors do not neglect); let her take advantage of the moment   when her mistress may more easily be persuaded, when she is more likely to   surrender to a lover's solicitations. At such times, the whole world seems <i>couleur   de rose</i> to her; gaiety dances in her eyes as</p>

 <p><a name="page_109"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 109</font></a></p>   
 <p>the golden wheat-ears dance in a fertile field. When the heart is glad,   when it is not gripped by sorrow, it opens and expands. Then it is that Love   slips gently into its inmost folds. So long as Ilion was plunged in mourning,   her warriors kept the Greeks at bay; it was when she was rejoicing and making   merry that she received within her walls the fatal horse with its   armèd freight. Choose, too, the moment when your charmer is smarting   from the insult of a rival; make her see in you a means of wiping off the   score. When, in the morning, she is doing her mistress's hair, let the maid   foment her anger, let her press on with sail and oar and, sighing, murmur, "Why   not, Madam, pay him out in his own coin?" Then let her talk of you; let   her adroitly sing your praises and swear that you, poor fellow, are wildly in   love with her. But don't lose any time, for fear the wind should drop and the   sails hang limp. Fragile as ice, a woman's anger is a transient thing.</p>   
 <p>"What about the maid herself?" you ask. "Is it well to win   her favours first?" Now that's a ticklish business. Sometimes it   stimulates their zeal; sometimes the opposite's the case. One girl will do   her utmost for her mistress, another will want to keep you for herself. The   only thing is just to try, and see how it turns out. On the whole, my advice   to you is "Don't." I shouldn't risk these steep and dangerous   by-ways myself. If you keep with me, you'll be on the right road. If,   however, you are taken with the servant's charms, if you find her as pretty   as she's zealous, win the mistress first, and afterwards turn your attention   to the maid; but don't begin with her. Only I warn you, if you have any faith   in my teaching, if my words are not dispersed by the winds over the seas,   don't make the attempt at all unless you carry it right through. Once she   herself is well involved, she won't give <i>you</i> away. The bird, with its   wings well limed, won't fly far; the boar can't escape from the nets; once a   fish is on the hook, he can't get away. So my</p>

 <p>advice to you is, push your attack well home, and don't be in a hurry to   withdraw your forces when the victory's won. Thus she'll be your companion in   crime, and she'll never betray you; she'll tell you everything you want to   know about her mistress. The great thing is to be careful. If you keep your   goings-on with the maid quite dark, you'll hear about everything her mistress   does.</p>   
 <p>Some people think that time and the seasons only concern farmers and   seafaring men. They're wrong. just as there's a time to sow, and a time to   sail, so there's a time to begin on a pretty girl. Success often depends on   your seizing the right moment to open the attack. Keep clear of her birthday,   for example, and shun the Kalends of March. Don't begin when there's a big   show on at the circus. That would prove the winter of your discontent, when   the stormy winds would blow, and you'd do well to hold off. If you launch the   ship then, you'll be lucky if you're washed ashore clinging to a spar. If you   want a really good opportunity, wait for the anniversary of the fatal day   when Roman blood incarnadined the waters of the Allia, or for that one day   out of the seven on which the Syrian Jew will do no manner of work. Above   all, don't go near her on her birthday; or indeed on any day when you're   expected to give a present. However much you try to wriggle out of it, she'll   make you buy her something. A woman always knows how to exploit an ardent   lover. Some pedlar fellow will be sure to turn up, and since buying's a mania   with them all, she'll be sure to find the very things she wants. She'll ask   you to look at ’em; then she'll kiss you, and say, " Oh, do buy me   that. It'll last for years; it's just the very thing I want, and you couldn't   buy me anything I should like more." It's no good saying you haven't got   the money on you; she'll ask you to draw a cheque, and then you'll curse the   day you learned to write. And how many times you'll have to give her something   for her birthday! Every time she wants anything very special, she'll have a</p>   
 <p><a name="page_111"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 111</font></a></p>   
 <p>birthday. And then she'll come grieving some pretended loss; she'll come   to you with eyes all red with weeping and tell you she's lost one of her   precious ear-rings. That's the little game they play. Then they'll keep on   asking you to lend them money; and once they've got it, I wouldn't give much   for your chances of getting it back. You can look on that as gone, and they   won't give you so much as a "thank you." Why, if I'd got ten mouths   and ten tongues, I couldn't tell you all the tricks our ladies of the <i>demi-monde</i>   get up to.</p>   
 <p>In the first place, it's best to send her a letter, just to pave the way.   In it you should tell her how you dote on her; pay her pretty compliments and   say all the nice things lovers always say. Achilles gave way to Priam's   supplications. Even the gods are moved by the voice of entreaty. And promise,   promise, promise. Promises will cost you nothing. Everyone's a millionaire   where promises are concerned. Hope, if only she is duly fostered, holds out a   long time. She's a deceitful goddess, but a very useful one. If you give your   mistress something, she may give you your <i>congé</i>. She will have   had her <i>quid pro quo</i>. Always make her think you're just about to give,   but never really do so. Thus your farmer will keep on manuring a barren   field, hoping it will produce a crop some day. Your gambler will keep   throwing good money after bad, in hopes of redeeming all his losses; and thus   his greed falls a victim to his hope of gain. The really great problem, the   problem that takes all a man's skill to solve, is to win a woman's favours   without making her a present. If you succeed in that, she will go on giving,   so as not to lose the guerdon of the favours she has already bestowed. So   send off your letter and couch it in the sweetest terms; it should be a sort   of preliminary reconnaissance and pave the way to her heart. A few characters   written on an apple led the young Cydippe astray and, when she had read them,   the rash girl found she was ensnared by her own words.</p>   
 <p><a name="page_112"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 112</font></a></p>   
 <p>Take my advice, my youthful fellow-citizens, and study the fine arts, not   only that you may champion the cause of some trembling dependent. The common   herd, the austere judge, and those superior people, the senators, are not the   only people who are moved by eloquence. But don't show your hand, and don't   be in too much of a hurry to display your powers of speech. And don't put on   the professorial style. Who but an idiot would write to his mistress as   though he were addressing a meeting. A show-off letter will often turn a   woman against you. Be quite natural, quite simple, but engaging. In a word,   say just what you would say if you were speaking to her. If she refuses your   letter and sends it back unread, don't give up; hope for the best and try   again. The unruly bull bows to the yoke in time, and, in time, the most   obstreperous colt gets broken in. You can wear through an iron ring by   continuous friction; the ploughshare wears away every day against the soil it   cleaves. What could you have harder than a rock, or less hard than water?   Nevertheless, water will wear away the hardest rock. So keep pegging away,   and, given time, you'll get your way with Penelope herself. Troy held out a   long time, but it fell at last. Suppose she reads your letter but doesn't   answer. So be it. Only keep her busy reading. Since she has condescended to   read, she'll answer some fine day. Everything comes gradually and at its   appointed hour. Peradventure she'll write in a huff and tell you to cease   annoying her. If she does, she's trembling lest you take her at her word. She   wants you to go on, although she tells you not to. So go on, and soon you'll   have your heart's desire.</p>   
 <p>If you see your mistress being borne along on her litter, go up to her as   if by accident, and say what you've got to say in vague ambiguous language,   for fear some busybody should be listening. If you see her hanging about   under some portico, as if she didn't know what to do with herself, go and walk   there too. Sometimes get</p>   
 <p><a name="page_113"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 113</font></a></p>   
 <p>in front of her, and sometimes drop behind. Don't be bashful about getting   clear of the crowd and crossing over to her side. Don't, on any account, let   her go to the theatre, looking her loveliest, without your being there to   see. Her bare shoulders will give you something charming to contemplate. And   you can look at her and admire her at your leisure; and speak to her with   eyes and gestures. Applaud the actor that plays the girl's part; applaud   still more the man that plays the lover. If she stands up, stand up too; and   while she is sitting, keep your seat; don't worry about the time, squander it   as your mistress may require.</p>   
 <p>And don't, for heaven's sake, have your hair waved, or use powder on your   skin. Leave such foppishness as that to the effeminate priests who wail their   Phrygian chants in honour of Cybele. Simplicity in dress is what best befits   a man. Theseus conquered Ariadne without troubling about the way his hair was   done. Phædra fell in love with Hippolytus, who certainly was not a   dandy. Adonis, a simple woodlander, was the idol of a goddess. Study to be   clean, let your skin be tanned in the open air, wear well-cut clothes, and   see there are no spots on them. Have a clean tongue, and let your teeth be   free from tartar; and don't slop about in boots that are two or three sizes   too big for you.</p>   
 <p>Don't let your hair stick up in tufts on your head; see that your hair and   your beard are decently trimmed. See also that your nails are clean and   nicely filed; don't have any hair growing out of your nostrils; take care   that your breath is sweet, and don't go about reeking like a billy-goat. All   other toilet refinements leave to the women or to perverts.</p>   
 <p>But lo, Bacchus is summoning his bard; propitious to lovers, he fosters   the fires with which he is consumed himself. Ariadne was wandering distraught   along the lonely wave-beaten shores of Naxos. Scarce had sleep departed from   her eyes, and she wore but an airy shift;</p>   
 <p><a name="page_114"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 114</font></a></p>   
 <p>her feet were bare and her fair tresses were blowing about her shoulders.   To the heedless billows she was crying wildly for her Theseus, and tears   flowed in torrents down her cheeks. She cried aloud and wept at the same   time. But both enhanced her beauty. "Oh, the faithless one," she   cried, beating her tender bosom again and again, "he has abandoned me.   Oh, what will become of me! What will be my fate!" She spake. And on a   sudden, drums and cymbals beaten and tossed by frenzied hands resounded along   the shore. Stricken with terror, she fell gasping out a few broken words, and   the blood faded from her lifeless corpse. But lo, the Mænads, with   their hair floating wildly out behind them, and the light-footed Satyrs, the   rout that leads the procession of Apollo, came upon the scene. Behold, old   Silenus, reeling-ripe as usual, who can scarce keep his seat on the ass that   staggers beneath the heavy burden. He pursues the Mænads, who flee from   him and mock him as they flee, and as he belabours his long-eared beast with   his staff, the unskilful cavalier tumbles head-foremost from his steed. And   all the Satyrs shout, "Up with you, old man Silenus, up with you   again!"</p>   
 <p>Meanwhile from his lofty chariot with vine branches all bedecked, the god,   handling the golden reins, drives on his team of tigers. The girl, in losing   Theseus, had lost her colour and her voice. Thrice she attempted flight,   thrice did fear paralyse her steps; she shuddered, she trembled like the   tapering stem or the slender reed that sways at the slightest breath.   "Banish all thy fears," cried the god. "In me thou findest a   tenderer, more faithful lover than Theseus. Daughter of Minos, thou shalt be   the bride of Bacchus. Thy guerdon shall be a dwelling in the sky; thou shalt   be a new star and thy bright diadem shall be a guide to the pilot uncertain   of his course." So saying he leapt from his chariot lest his tigers   should affright her. The sand yielded beneath his feet. Clasping to his   breast the swooning, unresisting</p>   
 <p><a name="page_115"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 115</font></a></p>   
 <p>girl, he bore her away. For a god may do as he wills, and who shall say   him nay. Then some sang <i>Hymenæe!</i> and some <i>Evion Evoë!</i>   and to these strains the god and his bride consummated their spousals on the   sacred couch.</p>   
 <p>When, then, you find yourself at a feast where the wine is flowing freely,   and where a woman shares the same couch with you, pray to that god whose   mysteries are celebrated during the night, that the wine may not overcloud   thy brain. ’Tis then thou mayest easily hold converse with thy mistress   in hidden words whereof she will easily divine the meaning. A drop of wine will   enable you to draw sweet emblems on the table wherein she will read the proof   of the love you have for her. Fix well thine eyes on her and so confirm the   message of thy love. Ofttimes, without a word being spoken, the eyes can tell   a wondrous tale. When she has drunk, be thou the first to seize the cup, and   where her lips have touched, there press thine own and drink. Choose thou the   dainties that her fingers have lightly touched, and as thou reachest for   them, let thy hand softly encounter hers.</p>   
 <p>Be courteous to her husband too. Nothing could better serve your plans   than to be in his good graces. If, when the dice are thrown, chance crowns   thee king of the feast, yield him the honour; take off thy wreath and place   it on his brow. Whether he be thy equal or inferior matters not. Let him be   served the first, and flatter him in everything you say. The surest and most   common means to success is to deceive him under the cloak of friendship. But   though ’tis sure and common, ’tis none the less a crime.   Sometimes in love the ambassador goes too far and doth exceed the terms of   his mandate.</p>   
 <p>Now I will lay down the limits thou shouldst observe in drinking: never   drink enough to cloud your brain or make your gait unsteady; avoid the   quarrels that are born of wine and be not prompt to take offence. Follow</p>   
 <p><a name="page_116"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 116</font></a></p>   
 <p>not the example of Eurytion, who, like a fool, gave up the ghost because   he had drunk too much. The food and the wine should inspire a gentle gaiety.   If you have a voice, sing; and if your limbs are supple, dance; in short, do   everything you can to make a good impression. Downright drunkenness is a   loathsome thing; simulated inebriety may serve a useful purpose. Let your   tongue falter with a cunning stammer; pretend it's difficult for you to   pronounce your words, so that whatever you do or say a little on the risky   side may be put down to the fact that you've had too much liquor. Drink to   your mistress, and do it openly, and drink to the man that shares her   bed-and, under your breath, curse her lawful spouse. When the guests rise up   to go, you'll have a good chance to get very close to your lady. Mingle in   the crowd, contrive to get near her, press her side with your fingers and rub   your foot against hers.</p>   
 <p>And now, we'll say, you've got her to yourself. Now you can talk to her.   Avaunt then, rustic modesty! Fortune and Venus favour the brave. Don't ask me   to tell you what to say. just take and begin, the words will come fast enough   without your having to search for them. You must play the lover for all   you're worth. Tell her how you are pining for her; do everything you know to   win her over. She will believe you fast enough. Every woman thinks herself   attractive; even the plainest is satisfied with the charms she deems that she   possesses. And, then, how often it has happened that the man who begins by   feigning love ends by falling in love in real earnest. Ali, my fair ones,   look with indulgent eye on those that give themselves a lover's airs; the   love, now feigned, will soon be love indeed.</p>   
 <p>By subtle flatteries you may be able to steal into her heart, even as the   river insensibly o’erflows the banks which fringe it. Never cease to   sing the praises of her face, her hair, her taper fingers and her dainty   foot. The coldest beauty is moved by praises of her charms, and</p>   
 <p><a name="page_117"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 117</font></a></p>   
 <p>even the innocent and greenest girl takes pride and pleasure in the care   of her good looks. If it were not so, wherefore should Juno and Minerva blush   even now to have failed to carry off the prize for loveliness, in the woods   of Ida? See that peacock there; if you belaud his plumage, he'll spread his   tail with pride; but if in silence you look at him, he'll never show his   treasures. The courser, in the chariot race, is proud of the admiration   bestowed on his well-groomed mane and his proudly arched neck. Be not   backward in your promises; women are drawn on by promises; and swear by all   the gods that you'll be as good as your word. Jove, from his high abode,   looks down and laughs on lovers' perfidies, and gives them to Æolus for   the winds to sport with. Often he swore to Juno by the Styx that he'd be   faithful, and he broke his vows. His example should lend us courage.</p>   
 <p>’Tis well that the gods should exist and well that we should believe   in them. Let us bring offerings of wine and frankincense to their immemorial   altars. They are not sunk in indolent repose and slothful ease. Live then in   innocence, for the gods are omnipresent. Fulfil the trust that has been   reposed in you; observe the precepts of religion; have nought to do with   fraud; stain not your hands with blood. If you are wise, practise deceit on   women alone, for that you may do with impunity; but in all other matters let   your word be your bond. Deceive them that are deceivers; women for the most   part are a perfidious race; let them fall into the snares which they   themselves have prepared. Egypt, so they tell, being deprived of the rains   which fertilise its soil, had suffered nine years of continuous drought when   Thrasius came to Busiris and announced that Jove could be propitiated by the   shedding of a stranger's blood. "Then," said Busiris, "thou   shalt be the first victim offered to the god; thou shalt be that   stranger-guest to whom Egypt shall owe the rain from heaven." Phalaris,   too, caused the ferocious</p>   
 <p><a name="page_118"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 118</font></a></p>   
 <p><span class="contnote"><font size="-2" color="GREEN">[paragraph continues]</font></span> Perillus to be burnt within the brazen bull which he had fashioned,   and the ill-fated craftsman was the first to put his handiwork to the proof   Both penalties were just; and indeed there is no law more righteous than that   the contrivens of death should perish by their own inventions. Wherefore,   since a lie should pay for a lie, let woman be deceived and let her blame no   one but herself for the treachery whereof she set the example.</p>   
 <p>Tears, too, are a mighty useful resource in the matter of love. They would   melt a diamond. Make a point, therefore, of letting your mistress see your   face all wet with tears. Howbeit, if you cannot manage to squeeze out any   tears--and they won't always flow just when you want them to--put your finger   in your eyes. What lover of experience does not know how greatly kisses add.   cogency to tender speeches? If she refuse to be kissed, kiss her all the   same. She may struggle to begin with. "Horrid man!" she'll say; but   if she fights, ’twill be a losing battle. Nevertheless, don't be too   rough with her and hurt her dainty mouth. Don't give her cause to say that   you're a brute. And if, after you've kissed her, you fail to take the rest,   you don't deserve even what you've won. What more did you want to come to the   fulfilment of your desires? Oh, shame on you! It was not your modesty, it was   your stupid clownishness. You would have hurt her in the struggle, you say?   But women like being hurt. What they like to give, they love to be robbed of.   Every woman taken by force in a hurricane of passion is transported with delight;   nothing you could give her pleases her like that. But when she comes forth   scathless from a combat in which she might have been taken by assault,   however pleased she may try to look, she is sorry in her heart. Phœbe   was raped, and so, too, was her sister Elaira; and yet they loved their   ravishers not a whit the less.</p>   
 <p>A well-known story, but one that may well be told again, is that of   Achilles and the maid of Scyros. Venus</p>   
 <p><a name="page_119"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 119</font></a></p>   
 <p>had rewarded Paris for the homage he had paid to her beauty when at the   foot of Mount Ida she triumphed over her two rivals. From a far-off country a   new daughter-in-law has come to Priam, and within the walls of Ilion there   dwells an Argive bride. The Greeks swore to avenge the outraged husband; for   an affront to one was an affront to all. Howbeit, Achilles (shame on him if   he had not yielded to a mother's prayers) had disguised his manhood beneath   the garments of a girl. "What dost thou there, descendant of   Æacus? Dost thou busy thyself with carding wool? Is that a task for a   man? It is by other arts of Pallas that thou shouldst seek for fame. What   hast thou to do with work-baskets? Thine arm is made to bear the shield. How   comes this distaff in the hand that should lay Hector low? Cast from thee   these spindles, and let thy doughty hand brandish a spear from Pelion."   Once chance brought Achilles and the royal maiden together in the same   bedchamber, and then the onslaught she underwent swiftly revealed to her the   sex of her companion. Doubtless she yielded only to superior force; so we   must of course believe; but at least she was not angry that force gained the   day. "Stay yet awhile," she said entreatingly, when Achilles, eager   to be gone, had laid aside the distaff to seize his valiant arms. What then   has become of this alleged violence? Wherefore, Deidamia, wilt thou retain   with pleading tones the author of thy downfall?</p>   
 <p>True, if modesty does not permit a woman to make the first advance, it   nevertheless delights her to yield when her lover takes the initiative. In   truth a lover reposes too much confidence in his good looks if he thinks that   a woman will be the first to ask. ’Tis for him to begin, for him to   entreat her; and to his supplications she will incline her ear. Ask and thou   shalt receive; she only waits to be implored. Tell her the cause and origin   of your desire. Jove bent the knee to the heroines of old times, and for all   his greatness, none ever came of her</p>   
 <p><a name="page_120"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 120</font></a></p>   
 <p>own accord to entreat him. If, however, you only get disdain for all your   pains, draw back and press your suit no farther. Many women long for what   eludes them, and like not what is offered them. Cool off; don't let her think   you too importunate. Do not betray the hope of too swift a victory; let Love   steal in disguised as Friendship. I've often seen a woman thus disarmed, and   friendship ripen into love.</p>   
 <p>A pale complexion ill becomes a sailor. The rays of the sun and the salt   spray should have tanned his features; nor does it suit the husbandman who,   with plough or heavy rakes, is for ever turning up the soil in the open air;   and ye who strive for the athlete's crown of olive, it would ill beseem you   to have too white a skin. But every lover should be pale; pallor is the   symptom of Love, it is the hue appropriate to Love. So, deceived by your   paleness, let your mistress be tenderly solicitous for your health. Orion was   pale with love when he wandered after Lyrice in the woods of Dirce. Pale,   too, was Daphnis for the Naiad that disdained him. Thinness, too, is an index   to the feelings; and be not ashamed to veil your shining hair beneath the   hood. Sleepless nights make thin a young man's body. So that thou mayest come   to the fruition of your desires, shrink not from exciting pity, that all who   behold you may exclaim, "Why, poor wretch, you are in love!" Shall   I complain aloud or only whisper it, how virtue is on every side confounded   with vice? Friendship and constancy are both but empty names. You cannot with   safety tell your friend all the charms of the woman you adore; if he believed   what you said of her, he would straightway become your rival. But, you will   argue, the grandson of Actor stained not the couch of Achilles; Phædra   erred not, at least, not in favour of Pirithoüs; Pylades loved Hermione   with a love as chaste as that which Phœbus bore for Pallas, or as the   love of Castor and Pollux for their sister Helen. But if you count on   miracles like that, you</p>   
 <p><a name="page_121"><font size="1" color="GREEN">p. 121</font></a></p>   
 <p>might as well expect to cull apples from the tamarisk, or to gather honey   in the middle of a river. Vice is so inviting, and each man seeks but to   gratify his own pleasure. And pleasure is sweetest when ’tis paid for   by another's pain. Shun those men you think you can rely on, and you'll be   safe. Beware alike of kinsman, brother, and dear friend. They are the people   who generally make the trouble.</p>   
 <p>I was on the point of ending here; but let me add that women are things of   many moods. You must adapt your treatment to the special case. The same soil   is not equally good for everything. This land is good for the vine, and this   for olives; and here's the place for corn. You'll find as many dispositions   in the world as you meet with different figures and faces. A clever man will   know how to adapt himself to this diversity of temper and disposition, and   suit his conversation to the needs of the hour, even as Proteus, who is now a   graceful wave, now a lion, now a tree, and now a boar with bristling hide.   It's the same with fish; some you spear, others you take with the line, and   others again in the encircling net. Different methods suit different people.   You must vary them according to the age of your mistresses. An old hind will   descry your machinations from afar. If you display too much skill to the   novice, and too much enterprise to the bashful, you'll frighten her and put   her on her guard. Thus it sometimes happens that a woman, who has feared to   yield to the caresses of a man of breeding, will fall into the arms of a   worthless knave.</p>   
 <p>A part of my enterprise is now achieved, though more remains behind. Here   then let us heave the anchor and give ourselves a little rest.</p>   </td>   <td valign="top" align="top" width="10%">

compos eris.<br>   Interea, sive illa toro resupina feretur,<br>       Lecticam dominae dissimulanter adi,<br>   Neve aliquis verbis odiosas offerat auris,<br>       Qua potes ambiguis callidus abde notis.<br>   Seu pedibus vacuis illi spatiosa teretur<br>       Porticus, hic socias tu quoque iunge moras:<br>   Et modo praecedas facito, modo terga sequaris,<br>        Et modo festines, et modo lentus eas:<br>   Nec tibi de mediis aliquot transire columnas<br>       Sit pudor, aut lateri continuasse latus;<br>   Nec sine te curvo sedeat speciosa theatro:<br>       Quod spectes, umeris adferet illa suis.<br>   Illam respicias, illam mirere licebit:<br>       Multa supercilio, multa loquare notis.<br>   Et plaudas, aliquam mimo saltante puellam:<br>       Et faveas illi, quisquis agatur amans.<br>   Cum surgit, surges; donec sedet illa, sedebis;<br>       Arbitrio dominae tempora perde tuae.<br>   Sed tibi nec ferro placeat torquere capillos,<br>       Nec tua mordaci pumice crura teras.<br>   Ista iube faciant, quorum Cybeleia mater<br>       Concinitur Phrygiis exululata modis.<br>   Forma viros neglecta decet; Minoida Theseus<br>       Abstulit, a nulla tempora comptus acu. <br>   Hippolytum Phaedra, nec erat bene cultus, amavit;<br>       Cura deae silvis aptus Adonis erat.<br>   Munditie placeant, fuscentur corpora Campo:<br>       Sit bene conveniens et sine labe toga:<br>   Lingula ne rigeat, careant rubigine dentes,<br>       Nec vagus in laxa pes tibi pelle natet:<br>   Nec male deformet rigidos tonsura capillos:<br>       Sit coma, sit trita barba resecta manu.<br>   Et nihil emineant, et sint sine sordibus ungues:<br>       Inque cava nullus stet tibi nare pilus.<br>   Nec male odorati sit tristis anhelitus oris:<br>       Nec laedat naris virque paterque gregis.<br>   Cetera lascivae faciant, concede, puellae,<br>       Et siquis male vir quaerit habere virum.<br>   Ecce, suum vatem Liber vocat; hic quoque amantes<br>       Adiuvat, et flammae, qua calet ipse, favet.<br>   Cnosis in ignotis amens errabat harenis,<br>       Qua brevis aequoreis Dia feritur aquis.<br>   Utque erat e somno tunica velata recincta,<br>       Nuda pedem, croceas inreligata comas,<br>   Thesea crudelem surdas clamabat ad undas,<br>       Indigno teneras imbre rigante genas.<br>   Clamabat, flebatque simul, sed utrumque decebat;<br>       Non facta est lacrimis turpior illa suis.<br>   Iamque iterum tundens mollissima pectora palmis<br>       'Perfidus ille abiit; quid mihi fiet?' ait.<br>   'Quid mihi fiet?' ait: sonuerunt cymbala toto<br>       Litore, et adtonita tympana pulsa manu. <br>   Excidit illa metu, rupitque novissima verba;<br>       Nullus in exanimi corpore sanguis erat.<br>   Ecce Mimallonides sparsis in terga capillis:<br>       Ecce leves satyri, praevia turba dei:<br>   Ebrius, ecce, senex pando Silenus asello<br>       Vix sedet, et pressas continet ante iubas.<br>   Dum sequitur Bacchas, Bacchae fugiuntque petuntque<br>       Quadrupedem ferula dum malus urget eques,<br>   In caput aurito cecidit delapsus asello:<br>       Clamarunt satyri 'surge age, surge, pater.'<br>   Iam deus in curru, quem summum texerat uvis,<br>       Tigribus adiunctis aurea lora dabat:<br>   Et color et Theseus et vox abiere puellae:<br>       Terque fugam petiit, terque retenta metu est.<br>   Horruit, ut graciles, agitat quas ventus, aristae,<br>       Ut levis in madida canna palude tremit.<br>   Cui deus 'en, adsum tibi cura fidelior' inquit:<br>       'Pone metum: Bacchi, Cnosias, uxor eris.<br>   Munus habe caelum; caelo spectabere sidus;<br>       Saepe reges dubiam Cressa Corona ratem.'<br>   Dixit, et e curru, ne tigres illa timeret,<br>       Desilit; inposito cessit harena pede:<br>   Implicitamque sinu (neque enim pugnare valebat)<br>       Abstulit; in facili est omnia posse deo.<br>   Pars 'Hymenaee' canunt, pars clamant 'Euhion, euhoe!'<br>       Sic coeunt sacro nupta deusque toro.<br>   Ergo ubi contigerint positi tibi munera Bacchi,<br>       Atque erit in socii femina parte tori,<br>   Nycteliumque patrem nocturnaque sacra precare,<br>       Ne iubeant capiti vina nocere tuo. <br>   Hic tibi multa licet sermone latentia tecto<br>       Dicere, quae dici sentiat illa sibi:<br>   Blanditiasque leves tenui perscribere vino,<br>       Ut dominam in mensa se legat illa tuam:<br>   Atque oculos oculis spectare fatentibus ignem:<br>       Saepe tacens vocem verbaque vultus habet.<br>   Fac primus rapias illius tacta labellis<br>       Pocula, quaque bibet parte puella, bibas:<br>   Et quemcumque cibum digitis libaverit illa,<br>       Tu pete, dumque petis, sit tibi tacta manus.<br>   Sint etiam tua vota, viro placuisse puellae:<br>       Utilior vobis factus amicus erit.<br>   Huic, si sorte bibes, sortem concede priorem:<br>       Huic detur capiti missa corona tuo.<br>   Sive erit inferior, seu par, prior omnia sumat:<br>       Nec dubites illi verba secunda loqui.<br>   Tuta frequensque via est, per amici fallere nomen:<br>       Tuta frequensque licet sit via, crimen habet.<br>   Inde procurator nimium quoque multa procurat,<br>       Et sibi mandatis plura videnda putat.<br>   Certa tibi a nobis dabitur mensura bibendi:<br>       Officium praestent mensque pedesque suum.<br>   Iurgia praecipue vino stimulata caveto,<br>       Et nimium faciles ad fera bella manus.<br>   Occidit Eurytion stulte data vina bibendo;<br>       Aptior est dulci mensa merumque ioco. <br>   Si vox est, canta: si mollia brachia, salta:<br>       Et quacumque potes dote placere, place.<br>   Ebrietas ut vera nocet, sic ficta iuvabit:<br>       Fac titubet blaeso subdola lingua sono,<br>   Ut, quicquid facias dicasve protervius aequo,<br>       Credatur nimium causa fuisse merum.<br>   Et bene dic dominae, bene, cum quo dormiat illa;<br>       Sed, male sit, tacita mente precare, viro.<br>   At cum discedet mensa conviva remota,<br>        Ipsa tibi accessus turba locumque dabit.<br>   Insere te turbae, leviterque admotus eunti<br>       Velle latus digitis, et pede tange pedem.<br>   Conloquii iam tempus adest; fuge rustice longe<br>       Hinc pudor; audentem Forsque Venusque iuvat.<br>   Non tua sub nostras veniat facundia leges:<br>       Fac tantum cupias, sponte disertus eris.<br>   Est tibi agendus amans, imitandaque vulnera verbis;<br>       Haec tibi quaeratur qualibet arte fides.<br>   Nec credi labor est: sibi quaeque videtur amanda;<br>       Pessima sit, nulli non sua forma placet.<br>   Saepe tamen vere coepit simulator amare,<br>       Saepe, quod incipiens finxerat esse, fuit.<br>   Quo magis, o, faciles imitantibus este, puellae:<br>       Fiet amor verus, qui modo falsus erat.<br>   Blanditiis animum furtim deprendere nunc sit,<br>       Ut pendens liquida ripa subestur aqua.<br>   Nec faciem, nec te pigeat laudare capillos<br>       Et teretes digitos exiguumque pedem:<br>   Delectant etiam castas praeconia formae;<br>       Virginibus curae grataque forma sua est.<br>   Nam cur in Phrygiis Iunonem et Pallada silvis<br>       Nunc quoque iudicium non tenuisse pudet? <br>   Laudatas ostendit avis Iunonia pinnas:<br>       Si tacitus spectes, illa recondit opes.<br>   Quadrupedes inter rapidi certamina cursus<br>       Depexaeque iubae plausaque colla iuvant.<br>   Nec timide promitte: trahunt promissa puellas;<br>       Pollicito testes quoslibet adde deos.<br>   Iuppiter ex alto periuria ridet amantum,<br>       Et iubet Aeolios inrita ferre notos.<br>   Per Styga Iunoni falsum iurare solebat<br>       Iuppiter; exemplo nunc favet ipse suo.<br>   Expedit esse deos, et, ut expedit, esse putemus;<br>       Dentur in antiquos tura merumque focos;<br>   Nec secura quies illos similisque sopori<br>       Detinet; innocue vivite: numen adest;<br>   Reddite depositum; pietas sua foedera servet:<br>       Fraus absit; vacuas caedis habete manus.<br>   Ludite, si sapitis, solas impune puellas:<br>       Hac minus est una fraude tuenda fides.<br>   Fallite fallentes: ex magna parte profanum<br>       Sunt genus: in laqueos quos posuere, cadant.<br>   Dicitur Aegyptos caruisse iuvantibus arva<br>       Imbribus, atque annos sicca fuisse novem,<br>   Cum Thrasius Busirin adit, monstratque piari<br>       Hospitis adfuso sanguine posse Iovem.<br>   Illi Busiris 'fies Iovis hostia primus,'<br>       Inquit 'et Aegypto tu dabis hospes aquam.'<br>   Et Phalaris tauro violenti membra Perilli<br>       Torruit: infelix inbuit auctor opus.<br>   Iustus uterque fuit: neque enim lex aequior ulla est,<br>       Quam necis artifices arte perire sua.<br>   Ergo ut periuras merito periuria fallant,<br>       Exemplo doleat femina laesa suo. <br>   Et lacrimae prosunt: lacrimis adamanta movebis:<br>       Fac madidas videat, si potes, illa genas.<br>   Si lacrimae (neque enim veniunt in tempore semper)<br>       Deficient, uda lumina tange manu.<br>   Quis sapiens blandis non misceat oscula verbis?<br>       Illa licet non det, non data sume tamen.<br>   Pugnabit primo fortassis, et 'improbe' dicet:<br>       Pugnando vinci se tamen illa volet.<br>   Tantum ne noceant teneris male rapta labellis,<br>       Neve queri possit dura fuisse, cave.<br>   Oscula qui sumpsit, si non et cetera sumet,<br>       Haec quoque, quae data sunt, perdere dignus erit.<br>   Quantum defuerat pleno post oscula voto?<br>       Ei mihi, rusticitas, non pudor ille fuit.<br>   Vim licet appelles: grata est vis ista puellis:<br>       Quod iuvat, invitae saepe dedisse volunt.<br>   Quaecumque est veneris subita violata rapina,<br>       Gaudet, et inprobitas muneris instar habet.<br>   At quae cum posset cogi, non tacta recessit,<br>       Ut simulet vultu gaudia, tristis erit.<br>   Vim passa est Phoebe: vis est allata sorori;<br>       Et gratus raptae raptor uterque fuit.<br>   Fabula nota quidem, sed non indigna referri,<br>       Scyrias Haemonio iuncta puella viro.<br>   Iam dea laudatae dederat mala praemia formae<br>       Colle sub Idaeo vincere digna duas:<br>   Iam nurus ad Priamum diverso venerat orbe,<br>       Graiaque in Iliacis moenibus uxor erat:<br>   Iurabant omnes in laesi verba mariti:<br>       Nam dolor unius publica causa fuit. <br>   Turpe, nisi hoc matris precibus tribuisset, Achilles<br>       Veste virum longa dissimulatus erat.<br>   Quid facis, Aeacide? non sunt tua munera lanae;<br>       Tu titulos alia Palladis arte petas.<br>   Quid tibi cum calathis? clipeo manus apta ferendo est:<br>       Pensa quid in dextra, qua cadet Hector,

virum.<br>   Viribus illa quidem victa est, ita credere oportet:<br>       Sed voluit vinci viribus illa tamen.<br>   Saepe 'mane!' dixit, cum iam properaret Achilles;<br>       Fortia nam posita

Quid blanda voce moraris<br>       Auctorem stupri, Deidamia, tui?<br>   Scilicet ut pudor est quaedam coepisse priorem,<br>       Sic alio gratum est incipiente pati.<br>   A! nimia est iuveni propriae fiducia formae,<br>       Expectat siquis, dum prior illa roget.<br>   Vir prior accedat, vir verba precantia dicat:<br>       Excipiet blandas comiter illa preces.<br>   Ut potiare, roga: tantum cupit illa rogari;<br>       Da causam voti principiumque tui.<br>   Iuppiter ad veteres supplex heroidas ibat:<br>        Corrupit magnum nulla puella Iovem.<br>   Si tamen a precibus tumidos accedere fastus<br>       Senseris, incepto parce referque pedem.<br>   Quod refugit, multae cupiunt: odere quod instat;<br>       Lenius instando taedia tolle tui.<br>   Nec semper veneris spes est profitenda roganti:<br>       Intret amicitiae nomine tectus amor. <br>   Hoc aditu vidi tetricae data verba puellae:<br>       Qui fuerat cultor, factus amator erat.<br>   Candidus in nauta turpis color, aequoris unda<br>       Debet et a radiis sideris esse niger:<br>   Turpis et agricolae, qui vomere semper adunco<br>       Et gravibus rastris sub Iove versat humum.<br>   Et tibi, Palladiae petitur cui fama coronae,<br>       Candida si fuerint corpora, turpis eris.<br>   Palleat omnis amans: hic est color aptus amanti;<br>       Hoc decet, hoc stulti non valuisse putant.<br>   Pallidus in Side silvis errabat Orion,<br>       Pallidus in lenta naide Daphnis erat.<br>   Arguat et macies animum: nec turpe putaris<br>       Palliolum nitidis inposuisse comis.<br>   Attenuant iuvenum vigilatae corpora noctes<br>       Curaque et in magno qui fit amore dolor.<br>   Ut voto potiare tuo, miserabilis esto,<br>       Ut qui te videat, dicere possit 'amas.'<br>   Conquerar, an moneam mixtum fas omne nefasque?<br>       Nomen amicitia est, nomen inane fides.<br>   Ei mihi, non tutum est, quod ames, laudare sodali;<br>       Cum tibi laudanti credidit, ipse subit.<br>   At non Actorides lectum temeravit Achillis:<br>       Quantum ad Pirithoum, Phaedra pudica fuit.<br>   Hermionam Pylades quo Pallada Phoebus, amabat,<br>       Quodque tibi geminus, Tyndari, Castor, erat.<br>   Siquis idem sperat, laturas poma myricas<br>       Speret, et e medio flumine mella petat. <br>   Nil nisi turpe iuvat: curae sua cuique voluptas:<br>       Haec quoque ab alterius grata dolore venit.<br>   Heu facinus! non est hostis metuendus amanti;<br>       Quos credis fidos, effuge, tutus eris.<br>   Cognatum fratremque cave carumque sodalem:<br>       Praebebit veros haec tibi turba metus.<br>   Finiturus eram, sed sunt diversa puellis<br>       Pectora: mille animos excipe mille modis.<br>   Nec tellus eadem parit omnia; vitibus illa<br>       Convenit, haec oleis; hac bene farra virent.<br>   Pectoribus mores tot sunt, quot in ore figurae;<br>       Qui sapit, innumeris moribus aptus erit,<br>   Utque leves Proteus modo se tenuabit in undas,<br>       Nunc leo, nunc arbor, nunc erit hirtus aper.<br>   Hi iaculo pisces, illi capiuntur ab hamis:<br>       Hos cava contento retia fune trahunt.<br>   Nec tibi conveniet cunctos modus unus ad annos:<br>       Longius insidias cerva videbit anus.<br>   Si doctus videare rudi, petulansve pudenti,<br>       Diffidet miserae protinus illa sibi.<br>   Inde fit, ut quae se timuit committere honesto,<br>       Vilis ad amplexus inferioris eat.<br>   Pars superat coepti, pars est exhausta laboris.<br>       Hic teneat nostras ancora iacta rates.</p>   </td>  </tr> </table>
